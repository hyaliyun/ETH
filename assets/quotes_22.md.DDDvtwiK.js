It was introduced with the J2SE 1.4 release of Java by Sun Microsystems to complement an existing standard I/O. NIO was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 51. An extension to NIO that offers a new file system API, called NIO.2, was released with Java SE 7 (\\"Dolphin\\"). \\"This JSR will be delivered as part of Java SE 7 \\"Dolphin\\".\\" Features and organization The APIs of NIO were designed to provide access to the low-level I/O operations of modern operating systems. Although the APIs are themselves relatively high-level, the intent is to facilitate an implementation that can directly use the most efficient operations of the underlying platform. The Java NIO APIs are provided in the package and its subpackages. The documentation by Oracle identifies these features. * Buffers for data of primitive types * Character set encoders and decoders * A pattern-matching facility based on Perl-style regular expressions (in package ) * Channels, a new primitive I/O abstraction * A file interface that supports locks and memory mapping of files up to \`Integer.MAX_VALUE\` bytes (2 GiB) * A multiplexed, non-blocking I/O facility for writing scalable servers NIO buffers NIO data transfer is based on buffers ( and related classes). These classes represent a contiguous extent of memory, together with a small number of data transfer operations. Although theoretically these are general-purpose data structures, the implementation may select memory for alignment or paging characteristics, which are not otherwise accessible in Java. Typically, this would be used to allow the buffer contents to occupy the same physical memory used by the underlying operating system for its native I/O operations, thus allowing the most direct transfer mechanism, and eliminating the need for any additional copying. In most operating systems, provided the particular area of memory has the right properties, transfer can take place without using the CPU at all. The NIO buffer is intentionally limited in features in order to support these goals. There are buffer classes for all of Java's primitive types except \`boolean\`, which can share memory with byte buffers and allow arbitrary interpretation of the underlying bytes. Usage NIO buffers maintain several pointers that dictate the function of their accessor methods. The NIO buffer implementation contains a rich set of methods for modifying these pointers: * The \`flip()\` method, rather than performing a \\"flip\\" or paging function in the canonical sense, moves the position pointer to the origin of the underlying array (if any) and the limit pointer to the former position of the position pointer. * Three \`get()\` methods are supplied for transferring data out of a NIO buffer. The bulk implementation, rather than performing a \\"get\\" in the traditional sense, \\"puts\\" the data into a specified array. The \\"offset\\" argument supplied to this method refers not to the offset from within the buffer from which to read, nor an offset from the position pointer, but rather the offset from 0 within the target array. * Unless using the absolute \`get()\` and \`put()\` methods, any \`get()\` or \`put()\` is conducted from the position pointer. Should one need to read from a different position within the underlying array, whilst not adjusting the writing position, the \`mark()\` and \`reset()\` methods have been supplied. * The \`mark()\` method effectively stores the position of the position pointer by setting the mark pointer to the position of the position pointer. The \`reset()\` method causes the position pointer to move to the mark pointer's position. * Upon invocation of the \`clear()\` method or the \`flip()\` method the mark pointer is discarded. * The \`clear()\` method does not ensure zero-ing of the buffer, but does return the limit pointer to the upper boundary of the underlying array, and the position pointer to zero. * \`put()\` and \`get()\` operations for NIO buffers are not thread safe. * You can only \`map()\` a from a up to \`Integer.MAX_VALUE\` in size (2GiB); regions beyond this limit can be accessed using an offset greater than zero. Channels Channels (classes implementing the interface ) are designed to provide for bulk data transfers to and from NIO buffers. This is a low-level data transfer mechanism that exists in parallel with the classes of the higher-level I/O library (packages and ). A channel implementation can be obtained from a high- level data transfer class such as , , or , and vice versa. Channels are analogous to \\"file descriptors\\" found in Unix-like operating systems. File channels () can use arbitrary buffers but can also establish a buffer directly mapped to file contents using memory-mapped file. They can also interact with file system locks. Similarly, socket channels ( and ) allow for data transfer between sockets and NIO buffers. \`FileChannel\` can be used to do a file copy, which is potentially far more efficient than using old read/write with a byte array. The typical code for this is: // Getting file channels try(FileChannel in = FileChannel.open(source, StandardOpenOption.READ); FileChannel out = FileChannel.open(target, StandardOpenOption.WRITE) ){ // JavaVM does its best to do this as native I/O operations. in.transferTo(0, in.size(), out); } Selectors A selector ( and subclasses) provides a mechanism for waiting on channels and recognizing when one or more become available for data transfer. When a number of channels are registered with the selector, it enables blocking of the program flow until at least one channel is ready for use, or until an interruption condition occurs. Although this multiplexing behavior could be implemented with threads, the selector can provide a significantly more efficient implementation using lower-level operating system constructs. A POSIX-compliant operating system, for example, would have direct representations of these concepts, select(). A notable application of this design would be the common paradigm in server software which involves simultaneously waiting for responses on a number of sessions. Character sets In Java, a character set is a mapping between Unicode characters (or a subset of them) and bytes. The package of NIO provides facilities for identifying character sets and providing encoding and decoding algorithms for new mappings. Reception It is unexpected that a Channel associated with a Java IO RandomAccess file closes the file descriptor on an interrupt, whereas RandomAccessFiles own read method does not do this.Don't Assume You Know What's Best, Shawn Pearce, author of Gerrit (Software), 2010-05-14. JDK 7 and NIO.2 JDK 7 includes a package which, with the class (also new to JDK 7), among other features, provides extended capabilities for filesystem tasks, e.g. can work with symbolic/hard links and dump big directory listings into buffers more quickly than the old File class does. The package and its related package, , provide comprehensive support for file I/O and for accessing the file system. A zip file system provider is also available in JDK 7.

He served as a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1996 to 1999, and was a member of Cabinet for the duration of his term. Early life Delamere was born in 1951 at a military hospital in Papakura, and was educated in Tauranga, attending Tauranga Boys' College. In 1967 and 1969, he was recognised as the top MƒÅori student in New Zealand. He then attended Washington State University on an athletic scholarship. Delamere obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1974. He later obtained an Master of Business Administration from Long Island University. Delamere served in the United States Army from 1974 to 1978. He was accountant stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and later joined the staff at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. After leaving the United States, Delamere worked as chief financial officer for Polynesian Airlines. He also held a number of bureaucratic roles. Delamere has also been successful in sporting events; setting records Wasson, David. 2016. Review of Staying a Jump Ahead.

At Washington State, he pioneered the technique of a full somersault in long jump competitions. Political career New Zealand First Delamere entered politics in the 1996 elections, when he successfully stood as a candidate for the New Zealand First party in the Te Tai Rawhiti electorate, defeating Sir Peter Tapsell and becoming one of the group known as the Tight Five. Immediately after being elected, he was appointed to Cabinet as part of New Zealand First's coalition deal with the National Party. Among the roles he held during his ministerial career were those of Minister of Immigration, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Associate Minister of Finance, and Associate Minister of Health.Tuariki Delamere Bio. Epik. Accessed 3 March 2012. In 1998, the coalition between New Zealand First and the National Party began to break apart, and significant tensions emerged in New Zealand First itself. On 11 August, it was claimed by ACT MP Rodney Hide that Delamere was planning a coup against New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, an allegation which Delamere denied. Two days later, Delamere acknowledged that he had been exploring the possibility a new political party based around the so-called \\"tight five\\", New Zealand First's group of MƒÅori MPs (not counting Peters himself). When Peters was sacked from Cabinet, Delamere openly supported the move, and pledged his support to the National Party government regardless of his party's stance. Delamere formally resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, saying that the party would be better known as \\"Winston First\\". Independent and Te Tawharau As an independent, Delamere continued to support the National government, and retained his ministerial portfolios. On 22 December 1998, Delamere announced gay and lesbian couples applying for permanent residency would have the same rights as straight de facto couples: a change Max Bradford, when Minister of Immigration, stated was too difficult. In late 1999, however, he lost his role as Minister of Immigration after a scandal regarding the application of immigration rules. Specifically, it emerged that Delamere had approved permanent residency for a group of Chinese businessmen provided they invested generously in various MƒÅori development schemes. Delamere was widely criticised for using his authority to ensure that money was given to certain groups. Delamere himself claimed that his actions were a perfectly reasonable method of addressing MƒÅori development needs. Although he lost the immigration portfolio, he retained his other roles.A Second Look At The Leadership Of Richard Prebble Shortly before the 1999 elections, Delamere joined the small MƒÅori Te Tawharau party, giving it its first representation in Parliament. He had previously declined to join the Mauri Pacific party, established by five other former New Zealand First MPs (including three of his \\"tight five\\" colleagues). Shortly prior to the election, Delamere announced that his party would support only a Labour Party government on confidence and supply if it won seats in the new Parliament. This was at odds with Delamere's unwavering support of the legislative programme of the Shipley Administration. In the elections, Delamere contested the new Waiariki electorate -- he placed second, with 20.01% of the vote. The winner was Mita Ririnui of the Labour Party. He was also placed second on the party list of the Mana MƒÅori Movement, which Te Tawharau was affiliated with, but the party did not win any seats. The Opportunities Party In 2020, more than twenty years after Delamere last stood for office, he joined The Opportunities Party (TOP) and was announced as its immigration spokesperson and candidate for Auckland Central in the 2020 election. Private sector Since leaving Parliament, Delamere has established himself as an immigration consultant, founding the company of Tuariki Delamere & Associates. He also owns a successful cabaret restaurant in Auckland, Finale Restaurant and Cabaret. In 2000 Delamere rejoined the New Zealand National Party, the party he had started his political career with. However he ruled out a return to Parliament to concentrate on his business concerns. In March and November 2005, Delamere appeared in court on charges of fraud. The trial began in the High Court in Auckland on 7 February 2007. After a 4-week trial, the jury found him not guilty of all charges after less than 2 hours of deliberation on 2 March 2007.

If a viewer's eye is outside this distance, a reduced field of view will be obtained. The calculation of eye relief is complex, though generally, the higher the magnification and the larger the intended field of view, the shorter the eye relief. Eye relief and exit pupil The eye relief property should not be confused with the exit pupil width of an instrument: that is best described as the width of the cone of light that is available to the viewer at the exact eye relief distance. An exit pupil larger than the observer's pupil wastes some light, but allows for some fumbling in side-to-side movement without vignetting or clipping. Conversely, an exit pupil smaller than the eye's pupil will have all of its available light used, but since it cannot tolerate much side-to-side error in eye alignment, will often result in a vignetted or clipped image. The exit pupil width of say, a binocular, can be calculated as the objective diameter divided by the magnification, and gives the width of the exit cone of light in the same dimensions as the objective. For example, a 10 √ó 42 binocular has a 4.2 mm wide exit cone, and fairly comfortable for general use, whereas doubling the magnification with a zoom feature to 20 √ó results in a much more critical 2.1 mm exit cone. Optics showing eye relief and exit pupil 1 Real image 2 Field diaphragm 3 Eye relief 4 Exit pupil Eye relief distance can be particularly important for eyeglass wearers and shooters. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the eyepiece, so that user needs a longer eye relief in order to still see the entire field of view. A simple practical test as to whether or not spectacles limit the field of view can be conducted by viewing first without spectacles and then again with them. Ideally there should be no difference in the field. For a shooter, eye relief is also a safety consideration. If the eye relief of a telescopic sight is too short, leaving the eye close to the sight, the firearm's recoil can force the optic's eyepiece to hit and cut into the skin around the shooter's eye, leaving a curved scarring laceration on the medial end of the supraorbital ridge and the eyebrow. This is frequently called a \\"scope bite\\", or the \\"idiot cut\\", due to the obvious and long-lasting nature of such a mistake. Typical eye relief distances for telescopic sights are often between one and four inches (25 to 100 mm), as opposed to the much shorter 15 to 17 mm for typical binoculars. The exit pupil widths in rifle sights are designed to be larger than the eye's pupil, to allow for a range of motion without vignetting. Available eye relief The eye relief given in product specifications does not always give a realistic view of what a user can expect. Although eye-cups can usually be folded down to allow the spectacle wearer to get closer to binocular eyepieces, there are sometimes lens mountings that do not allow the theoretical eye relief to be obtained. A better measure for those with strict needs would be one that takes account of this available eye relief, the theoretical value less any thickness of the lens' rims. This point can account for confusion in performance and is rarely expressed clearly. Additionally, when a spectacle wearer orders new glasses, the optician will ask them whether they prefer their spectacles close to the eyes or at some distance. This distance is referred to as the Back Vertex Distance, or BVD on a prescription. Since this property affects the available eye relief of any binocular or other optics used, (telescopes, microscopes, etc.) it should be borne in mind at the eye testing stage. The matter should be discussed with the optician, though the only realistic way of testing the comfort is to try the optical device while wearing the usual spectacles. The optician can however make sure that the BVD is no worse in the new glasses than in the old ones that were used during evaluation. Adding prescription lenses In the event that a spectacle wearer cannot obtain the eye relief that they require, some cameras and microscopes allow prescription lenses to be fitted onto their eyepieces. In this way, the user can temporarily dispense with glasses in favor of the lens mounted on the optics. Although this method does not afford good incidental vision for the field around them, it might still be of use to some.

Habitat  The vast majority of the species are native to temperate and subtropical regions of Asia. Elaeagnus triflora extends from Asia south into northeastern Australia, while E. commutata is native to North America, and Elaeagnus philippinensis is native to the Philippines. One of the Asian species, E. angustifolia, may also be native in southeasternmost Europe, though it may instead be an early human introduction there. Also, several Asiatic species of Elaeagnus have become established as introduced species in North America, with some of these species being considered invasive, or even designated as noxious, in portions of the United States.  Description  Elaeagnus plants are deciduous or evergreen shrubs or small trees. The alternate leaves and the shoots are usually covered with tiny silvery to brownish scales, giving the plants a whitish to grey- brown colour from a distance. The flowers are small, with a four-lobed calyx and no petals; they are often fragrant. The fruit is a fleshy drupe containing a single seed; it is edible in many species. Several species are cultivated for their fruit, including E. angustifolia, E. umbellata, and E. multiflora (gumi). E. umbellata contains the carotenoid lycopene.  Cultivation  Elaeagnus species are widely cultivated for their showy, often variegated, foliage, and numerous cultivars and hybrids have been developed. The fruit is acid and somewhat astringent. It makes good tarts.\\" E. angustifolia cultivated as bonsai Notable species and hybrids in cultivation include:- *Elaeagnus angustifolia *Elaeagnus commutata *Elaeagnus macrophylla *Elaeagnus multiflora *Elaeagnus pungens *Elaeagnus √ó reflexa *Elaeagnus √ó submacrophylla (syn. E. √ó ebbingei) *Elaeagnus umbellata The hybrid Elaeagnus √ó submacrophylla and the cultivar 'Gilt Edge' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Berries from a large-fruited cultivar  Ecology  Elaeagnus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora elaeagnisella and the Gothic moths. The thorny shrubs can also provide good nesting sites for birds.  Nitrogen fixation  Many Elaeagnus species harbor nitrogen-fixing organisms in their roots, so are able to grow well in low-nitrogen soils. This ability results in multiple ecological consequences where these Elaeagnus species are present. They can become invasive in many locations where they are established as exotic species. Two species (E. pungens and E. umbellata) are currently rated as category II noxious, invasive species in many world regions and by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council.

The population in 2011 was 793,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 19.19 km¬≤.Eurostat It is one of the smallest parishes of Ponta Delgada by population, although the largest in area. It contains the localities Cerrado da Ladeira, Cerrado das Freiras and Sete Cidades. History Latin origins The region received its geographic nomenclature from the Latin Insula Septem Civitatum, which means Island of the Seven Tribes or Island of the Seven Peoples (Portuguese: Ilha das Sete Tribos or Ilha dos Sete Povos), but became a historical reference as the Island of the Seven Cities. This comes from classical Latin, probably incorporated into the older traditions of Mediterranean peoples, through the navigators of European antiquity, or the Phoenicians. In Latin, civitas does not signify city, but rather a collectivity of citizens of a determined community. The first Iberian document to refer to Sete Cidades was a Latin chronicle from the city of Porto-Cale (the modern city of Oporto), written in 750 A.D. by a Christian cleric. During this era, the Iberian Kingdom of the Visigoths was in the process of collapse, under pressure from Muslim invasions (which began in 711 A.D.).Thomas Su√°rez, 1991, p.43 The Visigoth archbishop fled to Porto- Cale, fearing the assault of the Muslim forces, where he deliberated an escape to the lands in the Western Sea, which sailors insisted existed. In 734, the archbishop, accompanied by six other bishops, their prelates and approximately 5000 faithful, sailed away in a fleet of twenty ships.George E. Buker, 1992, p.155 The chronicle indicated that the fleet arrived at their destination, burned their ships and established seven Christian communities under the reign of the seven religious leaders. Although many prepared to follow, in truth, the archbishop (if he existed) was never heard from again, nor was the route to the mythical lands established. Although there are no proofs that the island of Seven Cities actually existed, the belief of their existence, some tentative expeditions and brief unconfirmed visual sightings of Atlantic islands, fostered legends during the European Middle Ages. Consequently many of the Medieval maps and charts that showed the Ocean Sea (the Atlantic Ocean) identified an island (or islands) represented in different positions or forms. The island of Brasil and/or Antillia (from the Brendan context) and the island of Sete Cidades, were usual geographic references that persisted in the proto- geography of the Atlantic. With the advent of the Age of Discovery, the visual references and number of voyages of discovery multiplied. One of the more consistent maps presented to King Afonso V of Portugal was from the Azorean, Fern√£o Teles (in 1473). This map showed a long coastline, with various islands, bays and rivers which the author declared were part of the fabled land of Sete Cidades. In reality, the map easily follows the northern coast of Brazil, between Maranh√£o and Cear√°, with the Rio Parna√≠ba delta. The King, himself, was not totally convinced of the discovery, or did not consider Fern√£o Teles sufficiently creditable, and that the map only represented a reference that required proofs. Unhappy with the outcome, Teles insisted on the validity of Sete Cidades. He consulted a Genovese cosmographer Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli (1398‚Äì1492), who declared that Antilla and the island of Sete Cidades existed along the margins of the Atlantic. In his famous letter, Toscanelli placed the mythical lands of Sete Cidades near the Azores: :\\"The island of Antillia was discovered by the Portuguese, and now when it is sought it is not found. In this island are people who speak the Spanish tongue, and who in the time of King Roderick are believed to have fled to this island from the barbarians who at the time invaded Spain. Here dwelt an archbishop with six other bishops, each of whom had its own particular city. Wherefore this island is called by many 'seven cities.' These people live most piously in the full enjoyment of all the riches of this time.\\" In 1476, the Teles's petition of royal authentication was accepted, but no expeditions were sent by the donatario. Of the better documented expeditions, the Fleming Ferdinand van Olm (also known in Azorean history as Fernando de Ulmo or Fern√£o Dulmo) captained an expedition to rediscover the lost kingdoms of Sete Cidades. Ironically, Fernando de Ulmo was then married to one of the daughters of Fern√£o Teles and lived on one of the islands of the Azores when, in 1486, he received authorization from King Jo√£o II of Portugal to begin his expedition. In partnership with Afonso do Estreito, a Madeirense, he organized his voyage, with the co-financing of the Royal Court, in order to conquer and subjugate the islands. Unfortunately, Fern√£o Dulmo did not have better luck, but ultimately, around the 17th Century, did organize an expedition to the northwest of Terceira, where an unknown island had been spotted.These mystical lands have been attributed to weather oddities primarily, when fog banks and clouds have been mistaken for other islands, such as the local myths about islands around the feast day of Saint John (June 24). Settlement The colonization of Sete Cidades developed after the property owner, Dr. Jos√© Bettencourt, who was the principal benefactor of the lands within the crater, made tracts available for settlement. These lands were rented to farmers and other colleagues, who then cultivated the limited tracts and paid monthly stipends for their use. For a long time, this limited the number of inhabitants living within the caldera. Geography Physical geography The setting of the village of Sete Cidades, as seen from the Boca do Inferno Belvedere, showing the crater lake Lagoa Azul and the tuff cone Lagoa do Santiago Caldeira Seca, one of the seven polygenetic cones formed during the 36,000 years of activity within the caldera The Sete Cidades volcano it situated on the extreme western portion of the island of S√£o Miguel occupying an area of approximately and refers to a polygenetic volcano (Sete Cidades Massif) and caldera.Robert B. Moore (1990), p.603 Its subaerial volume, of about , has grown at an estimated rate of per century, beginning more than 210,000 years ago. Presently, the interior of the structure is occupied by diverse volcanic structures and four lakes. It is almost circular caldera ( in diameter and up to high walls) formed through three phases of eruptions. The last intra-calderan eruption occurred approximately 500 years A.D., resulting in the creation of the Caldeira Seca cone. At the base of the caldera, there exist six Holocene era pyroclastic cones. Further, a large group of pleistocene post-caldera trachytic lava domes, lava flows, and pyroclastic flow deposits have been discovered on the northwestern flanks of the massif. The two crater lakes (), within the crater, are referred to by the color of the waters: blue, reflecting the sky () and green, reflecting the ground (). According to legend, the differently colored lakes were created when a princess and her lover, a young shepherd, had to part from each other. The tears they shed at their farewell became the two lakes, with the water colored like their eyes. Human geography The urbanized portion of the parish, the village of Sete Cidades, is located in the southwest portion of the crater within the Cumierias da Bretanha and extends from the Blue Lake north to south. Farmland, mostly pastures, are located around the village, and confined to the portions south of the Blue Lake. The remainder of the crater is forested, although the southeastern portion also has some grasslands. A bridge at the junction of the two lakes provides the most direct road connection to Ponta Delgada. In the western end of the crater, in an area of open parklands, a 1.2 km tunnel containing water pipes and a footpath links the crater to the village of Mosteiros. Architecture The front facade and alleyway to the Church of Saint Nicholas * Church of S√£o Nicolau (), the revivalist Neo-Gothic church is oriented around a single-nave, rectangular plan consisting of a sacristy, chancel and annexes, with differentiated covering and illuminated by lateral Gothic windows. The main facada includes a single, central belltower, with doorway and windows (also Gothic). The interior includes baptistery, triumphal arch and simple altar.

In the Whyte notation, a 6-2-0 is a railroad steam locomotive that has an unpowered three-axle leading truck followed by a single powered driving axle. This wheel arrangement is associated with the Crampton locomotive type, and in the USA the single class were sometimes referred to as Cramptons. Other equivalent classifications are: UIC classification: 3A (also known as German classification and Italian classification) French classification: 310 Turkish classification: 14 Swiss classification: 1/4 History The 6-2-0 was a most unusual wheel arrangement, where the bulk of the locomotive's weight was on the unpowered leading wheels rather than the powered driving wheels, therefore giving poor adhesion. The type was only practicable on the Crampton locomotive with a low boiler and large driving wheels placed behind the firebox. United Kingdom The only British 6-2-0 was the locomotive Liverpool built in 1848 by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy for the London and North Western Railway. It was exhibited at The Great Exhibition in 1851 but was only moderately successful and no more were built.Hamilton Ellis, Some classic locomotives, George Allen and Unwin, 1949, pp.11-12. USA On a trip to England, Robert L. Stevens, president of the Camden and Amboy (C&A;) railroad, saw demonstrations of 6-2-0s on the railways there. When he returned in 1848, Stevens asked his master mechanic Isaac Dripps to build him a 6-2-0 for use on the C&A.; The specifications for the first 6-2-0 included a 38\\" diameter boiler that would burn anthracite coal and 96\\" diameter driving wheels. Designing the locomotive type to burn coal, which was still fairly expensive and difficult to come by, was unusual for the time. The great majority of locomotives of the 1830s and 1840s were built to burn wood, which was very plentiful, cheap and exceptionally easy to obtain along the railroad rights of way. Besides being more expensive, coal required a larger firebox in which to burn. Dripps rose to the challenge and created an operable design. The first of three locomotives based on these specifications, named John Stevens, was completed in 1849. Dripps wasn't too sure that the locomotive would prove effective on American railroads, and his reservations turned out to be correct. The locomotive's tractive effort was not sufficient for long term or heavy work. With only one driving axle and three unpowered leading axles, too much of the locomotive's weight was distributed over the unpowered lead three axles. Almost a century passed before a six-wheel leading truck was used again, on the PRR S1 and S2. The C&A;'s management, on the other hand, thought it performed admirably enough to order two more of them and place them in passenger service. It was claimed that they could reach 60 m.p.h. at a time when fast trains reached only 40 m.p.h. The 6-2-0s were later rebuilt to 4-4-0s and were in use as late as 1865.

A print from Vitruvius Britannicus Colen Campbell (15 June 1676 ‚Äì 13 September 1729) was a pioneering Scottish architect and architectural writer, credited as a founder of the Georgian style. For most of his career, he resided in Italy and England. A descendant of the Campbells of Cawdor Castle, he is believed to be the Colinus Campbell who graduated from the University of Edinburgh in July 1695.page 7, Catalogue of the Drawings Collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects: Colen Campbell, John Harris 1973, Gregg International Publishers Ltd He initially trained as a lawyer, being admitted to the Faculty of Advocates on 29 July 1702. He had travelled in Italy from 1695‚Äì1702 and is believed to be the Colinus Campbell who signed the visitor's book at the University of Padua in 1697. He is believed to have trained in and studied architecture under James Smith,page 7, Catalogue of the Drawings Collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects: Colen Campbell, John Harris 1973, Gregg International Publishers Ltd this belief is strengthened by Campbell owning several drawings of buildings designed by Smith. Vitruvius Britannicus His major published work, Vitruvius Britannicus, or the British Architect... appeared in three volumes between 1715 and 1725. (Further volumes using the successful title were assembled by Woolfe and Gandon, and published in 1767 and 1771, see below.) Vitruvius Britannicus was the first architectural work to originate in England since John Shute's Elizabethan First Groundes. In the empirical vein, it was not a treatise but basically a catalogue of design, containing engravings of English buildings by Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren, as well as Campbell himself and other prominent architects of the era. In the introduction that he appended and in the brief descriptions, Campbell belaboured the \\"excesses\\" of Baroque style and declared British independence from foreigners while he dedicated the volume to Hanoverian George I. The third volume (1725) has several grand layouts of gardens and parks, with straight all√©es, for courts and patterned parterres and radiating rides through wooded plantations, in a Baroque manner that was rapidly becoming old-fashioned. Buildings were shown in plan, section and elevation, but also some were in a bird's-eye perspective. The drawings and designs contained in the book were under way before Campbell was drawn into the speculative scheme. The success of the volumes was instrumental in popularising neo-Palladian Architecture in Great Britain and America during the 18th century. For example, Plate 16 of Vitruvius Britannicus, a rendering of Somerset House in London, was an inspiration for American architect Peter Harrison when he designed the Brick Market in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1761.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., \\"Palladio and Patternbooks in Colonial America.\\" Campbell was influenced as a young man by James Smith (ca 1645 ‚Äì 1731), the pre-eminent Scots architect of his day, and an early neo-Palladian whom Campbell called \\"the most experienced architect\\" of Scotland (Vitruvius Britannicus, ii). The somewhat promotional volume, with its excellently rendered engravings, came at a propitious moment at the beginning of a boom in country house and villa building among the Whig oligarchy. Campbell was quickly taken up by Lord Burlington, who replaced James Gibbs with Campbell at Burlington House in London and set out to place himself at the center of English neo-Palladian architecture. In 1718, Campbell was appointed deputy to the amateur gentleman who had replaced Wren as Surveyor General of the Royal Board of Works, an appointment that Burlington is certain to have pressed, but a short-lived one. When Benson, the new Surveyor was turned out of office, Campbell went with him. Later Volumes There are some later volumes also published under the name ‚ÄòVitruvius Brittanicus‚Äô, but they are not connected to Colen Campbell's work, issued between 1715-1725. In 1739 a volume was issued by Badeslade and Rocque, described as ‚ÄòVolume 4‚Äô. However, this had little in common with Campbell, comprising mainly topographical perspective views of houses (54 plates). Between 1765‚Äì1771, Woolfe and Gandon published their ‚ÄòVolumes 4 & 5‚Äô (with 79 plus 75 plates). They discounted Badeslade‚Äôs volume, believing their work to be a more correct continuation of Campbell, hence numbering it as Volume 4. The plates are indeed mostly plans and elevations of buildings largely in the Palladian style, most dating from after 1750. The various Volumes are fully described in Harris.

Lord Herbert (as he then was) was inspired by it to design the similar Marble Hill at Twickenham for Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk, the mistress of the future George II. (Marble Hill was a 5-bay palladian villa with central pediment, raised on a high basement, with clumped screens of trees and formal turfed terraces descending to the Thames, illustrated right, that manifest the earliest stages of the English landscape garden.) * Houghton Hall, Norfolk, begun 1722, for Sir Robert Walpole, the Whig prime minister.

He was the first president of the Provisional Government of the Basque Country and the executive defense advisor during the Spanish Civil War. Under his mandate, the Provisional Government formed the Basque Army and fought for the Second Spanish Republic. Early life Jos√© Antonio Aguirre Lecube, 1933 Jos√© Antonio Aguirre was born in Bilbao, Biscay Province, Spain. He studied in the Basque Country's first Ikastola, a school in which all lessons were given in Basque. He later studied law at the University of Deusto. After his father's death in 1920, Aguirre moved with his family to Algorta, near Bilbao. At 16 years of age, he had to become a father figure to his 10 younger brothers and sisters. After finishing his law studies, he began working in the family business, Chocolates Aguirre. He later took responsibility for the business and introduced many reforms, including free health care and paid holidays, which significantly improved conditions for the workers in the factory. He also donated part of the business's revenue to the poor and advocated for social housing. Until 1937, Chocolates Bilba√≠nos S.A. was the second-largest business in its sector in Spain. Aguirre was a football player for Athletic Bilbao; he won the Copa del Rey with the club in 1923. During the Spanish Civil War, he was one of the main promoters of the Basque Country national football team, which played in Europe and the Americas to raise funds for Basque refugee children whose parents had been forced into exile. In 1926, after completing his military service, he began work as an attorney at Esteban Bilbao's office. Soon after, he founded his own firm, which focused on political issues and the working conditions of the lower class. At the time, Spain was ruled by the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. Aguirre, a Basque nationalist, joined the Basque Nationalist Party. The party was later divided into two political streams. Aguirre opposed the division, believing that the Basque Country was above any differences. He worked to unify the two factions and succeeded in 1930. Aguirre increased his involvement in politics and published articles in the newspapers Euzko Gaztedia and Euzkadi. As an example of his integrationist views and new ideals, in 1932, he proposed that the party should accept people who were not born in the Basque Country. Early political career Document signed by Aguirre in 1937 After the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera ended in 1930, a new political era began in Spain. In 1931 and 1932, Aguirre intervened decisively in failed attempts at Basque devolution, which called for self-government, including in Navarre. On 5 November 1933, two weeks before a general election, a referendum was held in √Ålava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay on new wording for the Statute of Devolution, which abandoned the inclusion of Navarre. The wording was approved by an overwhelming majority (459,000 votes in favour, 14,000 against),\\"Las irregularidades cometidas en el refer√©ndum, sobre todo en Vizcaya y Guip√∫zcoa, fueron reconocidas por los propios nacionalistas, que trataban as√≠ de alcanzar, con el apoyo del gobierno, el alt√≠simo porcentaje de votos previsto en la Constituci√≥n para la aprobaci√≥n de los Estatutos\\", El p√©ndulo patri√≥tico, Santiago de Pablo y Ludger Mees, Cr√≠tica, 2005, p√°g. 150. but in √Ålava, the votes in favour did not reach 50%.Los votos favorables fueron el 46,4%, los votos contrarios representaron el 11% y la abstenci√≥n fue del 41,41%, seg√∫n el libro \\"Los problemas de la Autonom√≠a vasca en el siglo XX: la actitud alavesa (1917‚Äì1979)\\" de Santiago de Pablo Contreras, pags. 119 y ss.

Su reclamaci√≥n al Congreso de los Diputados fue rechazada en enero de 1934, puesto que, entre otros motivos, muchos alcaldes actuaban a t√≠tulo personal sin que en su ayuntamiento se hubiera celebrado sesi√≥n municipal alguna en tal sentido.

Nacionalismo, Socialismo y Revoluci√≥n\\", Jos√© Luis de la Granja Sainz, Laven√ß, 1994. devolution was prevented until 1 October 1936, when the Spanish Civil War started. Spanish Civil War On 7 October, the councillors from Biscay, along with some from Gipuzkoa and √Ålava, participated in passing a ballot. A major uprising had occurred in √Ålava and Navarre, and most of Gipuzkoa was in the hands of the rebels, who, with the political machinations of the councillors, set the stage for major political change. Aguirre was elected lehendakari, or president. After a religious ceremony at the Basilica of Bego√±a in which he swore allegiance to Catholicism, his country and his party, he visited Guernica and took his oath of office in the Basque language: A government of conciliation was formed with Nationalists, Socialists, Communists, and other Republicans but not without tensions among them. The government was in power in Biscay for several months until the fall of Bilbao. The first Basque government was made up of four members of the Basque Nationalist Party (Aguirre as president and head of defense, Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Leizaola as head of justice and culture, Eliodoro de la Torre as head of finance, and Telesforo Monz√≥n as head of interior); three of the PSOE (Santiago Aznar as head of industry, Juan Gracia Col√°s as head of welfare, and Juan de los Toyos as head of labor); one of Basque Nationalist Action (Gonzalo N√°rdiz as head of agriculture); one of the Republican Left (Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aldasoro Galarza as head of trade); one of the Republican Union (Alfredo Espinosa as head of health); and one of the Spanish Communist Party (Juan Astigarrab√≠a as head of public works). The Basque Army (Basque: Eusko Gudarostea), with 100,000 soldiers, was made up of battalions of different ideologies. It was well armed but poorly trained, and one of its most acute deficiencies was the absence of heavy artillery and an air force. Aguirre begged Indalecio Prieto and Manuel Aza√±a to send some aircraft. Historians agree that it was not a viable option because of the difficulties in breaking the Siege of Biscay. However, 40 to 50 airplanes were sent in different shipments, most flying over enemy territory. Others were sent across France and, after being disarmed, were retained or returned to Barcelona or Valencia in accordance with a \\"no intervention\\" policy. Another factor that contributed decisively to the Basque Army's defeat was its lack of a qualified general staff. In June 1937, the Nationalists broke through the Iron Ring of Bilbao and entered the city as a result of the treachery of Alejandro Goicoechea, the engineer who had designed the fortifications. Aguirre moved his government to Truc√≠os before he headed to Santander and finally to Catalonia, where he prepared to continue fighting with his men. Kn May, Aguirre had entered into talks with the Italians, through intermediaries, about a possible surrender. The talks continued, with the leader of the Basque Nationalist Party, Juan de Ajuriaguerra, discussing terms, the Santo√±a Agreement, to allow a withdrawal from Bilbao if Nationalist troops did not attack the city. However, they attacked, and Aguirre refused to sign the surrender agreement and fought on. Exile Monument to Jos√© Antonio Aguirre in Bilbao Aguirre fled the country after the war and was pursued for years by agents of Francisco Franco. His exile took him to Paris, Berlin and New York City. In June 1940, the Breton Yann Fou√©r√© gave him documents that allowed him to escape France, which had been invaded by the Wehrmacht. Aguirre fled first to France, where he organised camps and services for Basque refugees and the government-in-exile. Caught behind enemy lines, he was in Belgium when Hitler occupied that country. He then fled to Berlin, where he lived underground until a false identity was arranged. Under the protection of a Panaman ambassador (Germ√°n Guardia, who provided him with a Panamanian passport), Aguirre reached Sweden. Dodging SS German intelligence, he arrived in Rio de Janeiro on the ship Vasaholm on 27 August 1941. The Brazilian customs authorities registered a Panamanian, Dr. Jos√© √Ålvarez Lastra, and a Venezuelan, Mar√≠a de Arrigorriaga, accompanied by their children, Jos√© and Gloria. They were actually Aguirre; his wife, Mar√≠a Zabala; and their sons, Aintzane and Joseba. Despite of intense efforts made by Manuel de Ynchausti in the United States, Aguirre's true identity was in danger of being discovered within a month. He wrote then to Ram√≥n Mar√≠a de Aldasoro, the former trade and business secretary of the Basque government, who led the Euzkadi delegation in Buenos Aires, Argentina. However, Aldasoro's efforts on Aguirre's behalf were unsuccessful because the Argentine authorities sympathized with the European \\"New Order\\". Aguirre went to Uruguay and asked a small group of Basque patriots for what Argentina had denied him. The Uruguayan president, General Alfredo Baldomir, agreed, and he even received Aguirre with honours in accordance with his status. Once the arrangements were complete, the public announcement of his arrival was made on 8 October in the newspapers of Montevideo. Aguirre's identity was reinstated, and he was given a visa to travel to New York, where he was put under the protection of resident Basques, who were leading movements in Mexico and New York. In New York, Aguirre took up a post as a lecturer at Columbia University. After the Pact of Madrid between the US and Spain, he went to France, where the Basque government-in- exile was established. There, he found that France's Vichy government had sequestrated the Basque government building and that President Charles de Gaulle was maintaining it on behalf of Francoist Spain. The building is now the Instituto Cervantes. The president of the government-in-exile was always a Basque Nationalist Party member, and even the Spanish sole representative in the United Nations was a Basque appointee, Jes√∫s de Gal√≠ndez, until his murder in an obscure episode at the time of Spain's entry to the United Nations. Aguirre also decided to place the large Basque exiles' network at the service of the Allies], and collaborated with the US Secretary of State and the CIA to defeat their common enemies.

From top to bottom: a spherical universe with greater than critical density (Œ©>1, k>0); a hyperbolic, underdense universe (Œ©<1, k<0); and a flat universe with exactly the critical density (Œ©=1, k=0). The spacetime of the universe is, unlike the diagrams, four-dimensional. The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is a cosmological fine-tuning problem within the Big Bang model of the universe. Such problems arise from the observation that some of the initial conditions of the universe appear to be fine-tuned to very 'special' values, and that small deviations from these values would have extreme effects on the appearance of the universe at the current time. In the case of the flatness problem, the parameter which appears fine-tuned is the density of matter and energy in the universe. This value affects the curvature of space- time, with a very specific critical value being required for a flat universe. The current density of the universe is observed to be very close to this critical value. Since any departure of the total density from the critical value would increase rapidly over cosmic time, the early universe must have had a density even closer to the critical density, departing from it by one part in 1062 or less. This leads cosmologists to question how the initial density came to be so closely fine-tuned to this 'special' value. The problem was first mentioned by Robert Dicke in 1969. The most commonly accepted solution among cosmologists is cosmic inflation, the idea that the universe went through a brief period of extremely rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang; along with the monopole problem and the horizon problem, the flatness problem is one of the three primary motivations for inflationary theory. Energy density and the Friedmann equation According to Einstein's field equations of general relativity, the structure of spacetime is affected by the presence of matter and energy. On small scales space appears flat - as does the surface of the Earth if one looks at a small area. On large scales however, space is bent by the gravitational effect of matter. Since relativity indicates that matter and energy are equivalent, this effect is also produced by the presence of energy (such as light and other electromagnetic radiation) in addition to matter. The amount of bending (or curvature) of the universe depends on the density of matter/energy present. This relationship can be expressed by the first Friedmann equation. In a universe without a cosmological constant, this is: :H^2 = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{3} \\\\rho - \\\\frac{kc^2}{a^2} Here H is the Hubble parameter, a measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding. \\\\rho is the total density of mass and energy in the universe, a is the scale factor (essentially the 'size' of the universe), and k is the curvature parameter -- that is, a measure of how curved spacetime is. A positive, zero or negative value of k corresponds to a respectively closed, flat or open universe. The constants G and c are Newton's gravitational constant and the speed of light, respectively. Cosmologists often simplify this equation by defining a critical density, \\\\rho_c. For a given value of H, this is defined as the density required for a flat universe, i.e. . Thus the above equation implies :\\\\rho_c = \\\\frac{3H^2}{8\\\\pi G}. Since the constant G is known and the expansion rate H can be measured by observing the speed at which distant galaxies are receding from us, \\\\rho_c can be determined. Its value is currently around . The ratio of the actual density to this critical value is called Œ©, and its difference from 1 determines the geometry of the universe: corresponds to a greater than critical density, , and hence a closed universe. gives a low density open universe, and Œ© equal to exactly 1 gives a flat universe. The Friedmann equation, :\\\\frac{3a^2}{8\\\\pi G}H^2 = \\\\rho a^2 - \\\\frac{3kc^2}{8 \\\\pi G}, can be re-arranged into :\\\\rho_c a^2 - \\\\rho a^2 = - \\\\frac{3kc^2}{8 \\\\pi G}, which after factoring \\\\rho a^2, and using \\\\Omega=\\\\rho/\\\\rho_c, leads to :(\\\\Omega^{-1} - 1)\\\\rho a^2 = \\\\frac{-3kc^2}{8 \\\\pi G}. The right hand side of the last expression above contains constants only and therefore the left hand side must remain constant throughout the evolution of the universe. As the universe expands the scale factor a increases, but the density \\\\rho decreases as matter (or energy) becomes spread out. For the standard model of the universe which contains mainly matter and radiation for most of its history, \\\\rho decreases more quickly than a^2 increases, and so the factor will decrease. Since the time of the Planck era, shortly after the Big Bang, this term has decreased by a factor of around 10^{60}, and so must have increased by a similar amount to retain the constant value of their product. Current value of Œ© The relative density Œ© against cosmic time t (neither axis to scale). Each curve represents a possible universe: note that Œ© diverges rapidly from 1. The blue curve is a universe similar to our own, which at the present time (right of the graph) has a small |Œ© ‚àí 1and therefore must have begun with Œ© very close to 1 indeed. The red curve is a hypothetical different universe in which the initial value of Œ© differed slightly too much from 1: by the present day it has diverged extremely and would not be able to support galaxies, stars or planets. Measurement The value of Œ© at the present time is denoted Œ©0. This value can be deduced by measuring the curvature of spacetime (since , or \\\\rho=\\\\rho_c, is defined as the density for which the curvature ). The curvature can be inferred from a number of observations. One such observation is that of anisotropies (that is, variations with direction - see below) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is electromagnetic radiation which fills the universe, left over from an early stage in its history when it was filled with photons and a hot, dense plasma. This plasma cooled as the universe expanded, and when it cooled enough to form stable atoms it no longer absorbed the photons. The photons present at that stage have been propagating ever since, growing fainter and less energetic as they spread through the ever-expanding universe. The temperature of this radiation is almost the same at all points on the sky, but there is a slight variation (around one part in 100,000) between the temperature received from different directions. The angular scale of these fluctuations - the typical angle between a hot patch and a cold patch on the skySince there are fluctuations on many scales, not a single angular separation between hot and cold spots, the necessary measure is the angular scale of the first peak in the anisotropies' power spectrum. See Cosmic Microwave Background#Primary anisotropy. \\\\- depends on the curvature of the universe which in turn depends on its density as described above. Thus, measurements of this angular scale allow an estimation of Œ©0. Another probe of Œ©0 is the frequency of Type-Ia supernovae at different distances from Earth.Ryden p. 168 These supernovae, the explosions of degenerate white dwarf stars, are a type of standard candle; this means that the processes governing their intrinsic brightness are well understood so that a measure of apparent brightness when seen from Earth can be used to derive accurate distance measures for them (the apparent brightness decreasing in proportion to the square of the distance - see luminosity distance). Comparing this distance to the redshift of the supernovae gives a measure of the rate at which the universe has been expanding at different points in history. Since the expansion rate evolves differently over time in cosmologies with different total densities, Œ©0 can be inferred from the supernovae data. Data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (measuring CMB anisotropies) combined with that from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and observations of type-Ia supernovae constrain Œ©0 to be 1 within 1%. In other words, the term |Œ© ‚àí 1is currently less than 0.01, and therefore must have been less than 10‚àí62 at the Planck era. Implication This tiny value is the crux of the flatness problem. If the initial density of the universe could take any value, it would seem extremely surprising to find it so 'finely tuned' to the critical value \\\\rho_c. Indeed, a very small departure of Œ© from 1 in the early universe would have been magnified during billions of years of expansion to create a current density very far from critical. In the case of an overdensity this would lead to a universe so dense it would cease expanding and collapse into a Big Crunch (an opposite to the Big Bang in which all matter and energy falls back into an extremely dense state) in a few years or less; in the case of an underdensity it would expand so quickly and become so sparse it would soon seem essentially empty, and gravity would not be strong enough by comparison to cause matter to collapse and form galaxies. In either case the universe would contain no complex structures such as galaxies, stars, planets and any form of life.Ryden p. 193 This problem with the Big Bang model was first pointed out by Robert Dicke in 1969, and it motivated a search for some reason the density should take such a specific value. Solutions to the problem Some cosmologists agreed with Dicke that the flatness problem was a serious one, in need of a fundamental reason for the closeness of the density to criticality. But there was also a school of thought which denied that there was a problem to solve, arguing instead that since the universe must have some density it may as well have one close to \\\\rho_{crit} as far from it, and that speculating on a reason for any particular value was \\"beyond the domain of science\\". Enough cosmologists saw the problem as a real one, however, for various solutions to be proposed. Anthropic principle One solution to the problem is to invoke the anthropic principle, which states that humans should take into account the conditions necessary for them to exist when speculating about causes of the universe's properties. If two types of universe seem equally likely but only one is suitable for the evolution of intelligent life, the anthropic principle suggests that finding ourselves in that universe is no surprise: if the other universe had existed instead, there would be no observers to notice the fact. The principle can be applied to solve the flatness problem in two somewhat different ways. The first (an application of the 'strong anthropic principle') was suggested by C. B. Collins and Stephen Hawking, who in 1973 considered the existence of an infinite number of universes such that every possible combination of initial properties was held by some universe. In such a situation, they argued, only those universes with exactly the correct density for forming galaxies and stars would give rise to intelligent observers such as humans: therefore, the fact that we observe Œ© to be so close to 1 would be \\"simply a reflection of our own existence.\\" An alternative approach, which makes use of the 'weak anthropic principle', is to suppose that the universe is infinite in size, but with the density varying in different places (i.e. an inhomogeneous universe). Thus some regions will be over-dense and some under-dense . These regions may be extremely far apart - perhaps so far that light has not had time to travel from one to another during the age of the universe (that is, they lie outside one another's cosmological horizons). Therefore, each region would behave essentially as a separate universe: if we happened to live in a large patch of almost-critical density we would have no way of knowing of the existence of far-off under- or over-dense patches since no light or other signal has reached us from them. An appeal to the anthropic principle can then be made, arguing that intelligent life would only arise in those patches with Œ© very close to 1, and that therefore our living in such a patch is unsurprising. This latter argument makes use of a version of the anthropic principle which is 'weaker' in the sense that it requires no speculation on multiple universes, or on the probabilities of various different universes existing instead of the current one. It requires only a single universe which is infinite - or merely large enough that many disconnected patches can form - and that the density varies in different regions (which is certainly the case on smaller scales, giving rise to galactic clusters and voids). However, the anthropic principle has been criticised by many scientists. For example, in 1979 Bernard Carr and Martin Rees argued that the principle ‚Äúis entirely post hoc: it has not yet been used to predict any feature of the Universe.‚Äù Others have taken objection to its philosophical basis, with Ernan McMullin writing in 1994 that \\"the weak Anthropic principle is trivial ... and the strong Anthropic principle is indefensible.\\" Since many physicists and philosophers of science do not consider the principle to be compatible with the scientific method, another explanation for the flatness problem was needed. Inflation The standard solution to the flatness problem invokes cosmic inflation, a process whereby the universe expands exponentially quickly (i.e. a grows as e^{\\\\lambda t} with time t, for some constant \\\\lambda) during a short period in its early history. The theory of inflation was first proposed in 1979, and published in 1981, by Alan Guth. His two main motivations for doing so were the flatness problem and the horizon problem, another fine-tuning problem of physical cosmology. The proposed cause of inflation is a field which permeates space and drives the expansion. The field contains a certain energy density, but unlike the density of the matter or radiation present in the late universe, which decrease over time, the density of the inflationary field remains roughly constant as space expands. Therefore, the term \\\\rho a^2 increases extremely rapidly as the scale factor a grows exponentially. Recalling the Friedmann Equation :(\\\\Omega^{-1} - 1)\\\\rho a^2 = \\\\frac{-3kc^2}{8\\\\pi G}, and the fact that the right-hand side of this expression is constant, the term \\\\Omega^{-1} - 1 must therefore decrease with time. Thus if \\\\Omega^{-1} - 1 initially takes any arbitrary value, a period of inflation can force it down towards 0 and leave it extremely small - around 10^{-62} as required above, for example. Subsequent evolution of the universe will cause the value to grow, bringing it to the currently observed value of around 0.01. Thus the sensitive dependence on the initial value of Œ© has been removed: a large and therefore 'unsurprising' starting value need not become amplified and lead to a very curved universe with no opportunity to form galaxies and other structures. This success in solving the flatness problem is considered one of the major motivations for inflationary theory. Post inflation Although inflationary theory is regarded as having had much success, and the evidence for it is compelling, it is not universally accepted: cosmologists recognize that there are still gaps in the theory and are open to the possibility that future observations will disprove it. In particular, in the absence of any firm evidence for what the field driving inflation should be, many different versions of the theory have been proposed. Many of these contain parameters or initial conditions which themselves require fine-tuning in much the way that the early density does without inflation. For these reasons work is still being done on alternative solutions to the flatness problem. These have included non-standard interpretations of the effect of dark energy and gravity, particle production in an oscillating universe, and use of a Bayesian statistical approach to argue that the problem is non-existent. The latter argument, suggested for example by Evrard and Coles, maintains that the idea that Œ© being close to 1 is 'unlikely' is based on assumptions about the likely distribution of the parameter which are not necessarily justified.. Despite this ongoing work, inflation remains by far the dominant explanation for the flatness problem.. The question arises, however, whether it is still the dominant explanation because it is the best explanation, or because the community is unaware of progress on this problem. In particular, in addition to the idea that Œ© is not a suitable parameter in this context, other arguments against the flatness problem have been presented: if the universe collapses in the future, then the flatness problem \\"exists\\", but only for a relatively short time, so a typical observer would not expect to measure Œ© appreciably different from 1; in the case of a universe which expands forever with a positive cosmological constant, fine-tuning is needed not to achieve a (nearly) flat universe, but also to avoid it. Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory The flatness problem is naturally solved by the Einstein‚ÄìCartan‚ÄìSciama‚ÄìKibble theory of gravity, without an exotic form of matter required in inflationary theory. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamical variable. It has no free parameters. Including torsion gives the correct conservation law for the total (orbital plus intrinsic) angular momentum of matter in the presence of gravity. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors obeying the nonlinear Dirac equation generates a spin-spin interaction which is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction averts the unphysical big bang singularity, replacing it with a bounce at a finite minimum scale factor, before which the Universe was contracting. The rapid expansion immediately after the big bounce explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. As the density of the Universe decreases, the effects of torsion weaken and the Universe smoothly enters the radiation-dominated era.

The term herbaceous border is mostly in use in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. In North America, the term perennial border is normally used. Herbaceous borders as they are known today were first popularly used in gardens in the Victorian era. Hybridization and new imported plant species revolutionized the form of British gardens in the 18th and 19th centuries. In addition, the works of Gertrude Jekyll, a British 20th-century garden designer and prolific writer, popularized the use of the herbaceous border through a revival of the British cottage garden. Maintaining the herbaceous border is work-intensive, as the perennials have to be dug up every 3‚Äì4 years and divided to keep the bed clean-looking and prevent overgrowth of the plants. In World War I this type of border became less popular in Britain as there was a shortage of labour to keep the gardens maintained. However, there are still some celebrated examples in British gardens. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the world's longest herbaceous border, at 215 metres (705 ft), is at Dirleton Castle, East Lothian, Scotland.

The book tells the story of fictional baseball great Billy Chapel, thirty-seven years old and nearing the end of his career. Plot summary On the second to last day of the season, Chapel's team, the Atlanta Hawks, are about to play against the New York Yankees. Chapel receives news from a friend in the media that he is about to be traded. Just the night before, his girlfriend Carol did not show up at his hotel room, and Chapel reaches the conclusion that it is time to move on and finally make the transition from boyhood to manhood. Over half the book tells the story of that final game, with flashbacks from the pitching mound and dugout to incidents throughout Chapel's life. Chapel is determined that his last game will also be his greatest, even though, with all the young new players on the Yankees, they are a far superior team. As he strikes out his opponents one after the other, he soon becomes aware of the fact that he has held the Yankees at bay thus far, not allowing one hit from the more talented Yankees team. He soon becomes determined to pitch a perfect game. Meanwhile, he reflects on his personal life, and especially on Carol, whom he finally realizes that he loves, even though he has never shown her that he really does. That morning Carol told him she was going to London and was leaving immediately, so the two key passions of his life, Carol and baseball, are about to vanish forever. As the game proceeds, Chapel feels the sharp pain in his arm that comes with age. Nevertheless, he refuses to give up the pitching mound, and chooses instead to divert his attention by delving deeper into his life and his relationship. At the end of the game, he has pitched a perfect game and retires from baseball with a new dignity. After the celebrations, he heads to the hotel and dials Carol's home, where he plans to go to tell Carol his feelings. With baseball behind him, he has grown from a boy who has led a life into manhood. This short book was discovered after Shaara's death, and publishing was arranged by his son, author Jeffrey Shaara.

Cobra Trap was released 11 years after the previous book in the series, Dead Man's Handle. It was the final book to be written by O'Donnell before his death in 2010.  Contents  The stories featured in the collection are Bellman, The Dark Angels, Old Alex, The Girl With the Black Balloon and Cobra Trap. Bellman is an adaptation of the 1968 comic strip serial The Killing Ground.O'Donnell, Peter, Introduction to \\"The Killing Ground\\" in Modesty Blaise: The Black Pearl (Titan Books, December 2004), np All five stories take place at different times in the life of Modesty Blaise. The first, Bellman, begins with a flashback to when Modesty is 20 years old. In The Dark Angels Modesty is in her late 20s, in Old Alex she is in her early 30s, in The Girl With the Black Balloon she is in her late 30s, and finally in Cobra Trap, she is about 52. Ages are approximate because they are not specified and Modesty does not know her exact age. In Old Alex, O'Donnell makes it clear that fictional Modesty has a different rate of ageing than real people. The Old Alex story is set in 1997, so assuming that stories in the first books took place around 1965‚Äì1970, then Blaise aged something like eight years during an actual 30-year period. \\"Cobra Trap\\", the title piece of the collection, is (among fans) the most controversial Modesty Blaise story, in that it profiles the final mission of Modesty and her partner, Willie Garvin. The story takes place 10‚Äì15 years after the time frame of the comic strip/novels. Modesty, who has been recently diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and given only a short time to live, chooses to give her life to save a train full of innocents, including many children, from a group of rebels. Soon after revealing her illness to Willie, Modesty is killed in an attack, and shortly after that Willie too is shot dead. The story ends with the two friends reuniting in some form of afterlife. When Peter O'Donnell brought his comic strip to a close five years later he chose to do so with a more upbeat story promising future adventures. In 2002, a comic book adaptation of \\"The Dark Angels\\" was published in Scandinavia as a postscript to the British Modesty Blaise daily strip; Enrique Badia Romero, the final artist on the Evening Standard comic strip, adapted the story for the publication. To date its only English-language publication has been in the American magazine Comics Revue. Elements of several other stories (in particular \\"Old Alex\\" and \\"Bellman\\") also appeared in the comic strip prior to being featured in Cobra Trap. The original first edition cover art for Cobra Trap was a painting of Modesty Blaise by Jim Holdaway, who had drawn the original comic strip for O'Donnell from 1963 until his death in 1970. Cobra Trap was at one point considered one of the rarest of the Modesty Blaise book series as it is the only one that was not initially made available in paperback and the hardcover editions went out of print and are considered collectables. However, Souvenir Press released a paperback edition of the collection in 2006, 10 years after the hardcover release, putting the book into wide circulation again.

It was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1972, and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1991 together with the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. Location and topography The sanctuary is at the western national border of Thailand with Burma, in the southern area of the Dawna Range. It extends northeast of the Three Pagodas Pass from Sangkhla Buri District in Kanchanaburi Province into Umphang District in Tak Province. The wildlife sanctuary stretches over an area of about , and is the largest protected area in Thailand. Together with the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary () it constitutes the core area of the western forest complex, which represents the largest agglomeration of contiguous protected area in mainland Southeast Asia, .http://www.westernforest.org/en/Default.htm The area is predominantly mountainous and composed of various limestones interspersed with massive intrusions of granite and smaller outcrops of quartzite and schist. Elevations range from about at the Vajiralongkorn Reservoir in the south of the sanctuary to its highest peak, Khao Tai Pa, at . Major rivers are the Mae Klong and the Mae Chan which originate in the Umphang Wildlife Sanctuary and join in Thung Yai into the Upper Khwae Yai which feeds the Si Nakharin Reservoir. Various smaller rivers in the south and southwest feed the Vajiralongkorn Reservoir while in the northwestern part of the sanctuary the Mae Kasat and the Mae Suriya flow into Burma. Climate and rainfall The climate of the region is characterised by three seasons: a hot, wet season from May to October, a cooler, dry period from November to January and a hot, dry season from February to April. Average minimum and maximum daily temperatures range from in the wet season, in the hot, dry season, and in the cooler season. Day-time temperatures can exceed in April, while nighttime temperatures of are not uncommon in the cool season. The average annual rainfall decreases from the western part of the sanctuary receiving a year to annual rainfalls of between 1,600 and 2,000 millimetres in the eastern parts of the sanctuary. Over 80 percent of the rain is brought by the southwest monsoon from the Andaman Sea. Flora and habitat types Phytogeographically the sanctuary lies at the interface between the terminal southern ridges of the eastern Himalayas and the equatorial forests of the great Sunda Shelf. As most of the sanctuary is botanically unexplored, scientific knowledge about its rich flora is sparse. montane evergreen forests cover about 15 percent of the sanctuary and occur along the mountain ridges above 1,000 metres where moisture levels are high. Seasonal or dry evergreen forests are found on about 31 percent of the area, predominantly on land lying between 800-1,000 metres elevation. Gallery evergreen forests occur along permanent watercourses, where humidity is high and the soil perpetually moist. They are often categorized under dry evergreen forests, but are particularly important to the sanctuary's fauna. Mixed deciduous forest is the most common forest type in Thung Yai, covering about 45 percent, predominantly in areas below elevation. Dry dipterocarp forest is a formation unique to mainland Southeast Asia and is found on about one percent of the area. Savanna forest and grassland covers about four percent, predominantly in the thung yai or \\"big field\\" covering about 140 km2 at the centre of the sanctuary. The remaining 4% of the area are categorized as secondary forests, fallow areas, and swidden fields in the nomination for the World Heritage Site, but include also various bamboo forests which are not included in this classification.Steinmetz, R.

Among the mammal species living in Thung Yai are lar gibbon (Hylobates lar), various species of macaque (Macaca) and lutung (Trachypithecus), Indochinese tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), Indochinese leopard (Panthera pardus delacouri), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) and Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), gaur (Bos gaurus), hog deer (Cervus porcinus), sambar (Rusa unicolor), Fea's muntjac (Muntiacus feae) und Sumatran serow (Capricornis sumatraensis) as well as many bat species probably including Kitti's hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai). Thung Yai is part of the Western Forest Complex, which is the largest tiger habitat in the Southeast Asia region, with around 200 of the animals living there. The area is known as a natural breeding area for tigers in Thailand and Myanmar as well. Banteng (Bos javanicus) and wild water buffalo (Bubalus amee) are known to occur in the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and may exist in Thung Yai too. Indications for the occurrence of Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus) and northern Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis) in the area are recorded from the 1980s, but have not been confirmed since then. Bird species sighted in Thung Yai include white- winged wood duck (Cairina scutulata), kalij pheasant (Lophura leucomelanos), grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis), lesser fish eagle (Ichthyophaga humilis) and all six species of hornbill (Bucerotidae) living in mainland Southeast Asia. The nomination for the two wildlife sanctuaries, Thung Yai Naresuan and Huai Kha Khaeng, to become World Heritage Sites lists some 120 species of mammal, 400 birds, 96 reptiles, 43 amphibians, and 113 species of fish, but research on the biodiversity in the sanctuaries is sparse. Poaching According to the Bangkok Post, the preserve, \\"... has been notorious for decades as an area where rich and powerful people enjoy poaching and game hunting.\\" In early 2018, Premchai Karnasuta. the president of the Italian-Thai Development PLC (ITD), one of Thailand's largest construction companies, was arrested in the sanctuary in possession of skinned carcasses of protected wild animals, including a black leopard, a Kalij pheasant, and a common muntjac (also known as a barking deer), as well as three rifles and ammunition. Premchai faces several charges including trespassing and poaching. He has maintained his innocence. \\"I didn't do it,\\" he told local media. He has failed to explain, however, why he was in the wildlife sanctuary and how the carcasses of the freshly killed leopard and several other endangered animals ended up in his possession. If convicted, he may be incarcerated for up to 28 years. Conservationists fear that the billionaire will be let off lightly for a wildlife crime that would see an average citizen sent to prison for years. In the most high-profile poaching case, on 29 April 1973 a military helicopter crashed in the sanctuary, killing six high-ranking police and military officers. It turned out that they were part of a group of more than 50 officers on an illegal four-day hunting trip in the preserve. The report claimed these hunters cooked and ate the animals they killed at parties. The military refused to admit wrongdoing and the event was brushed aside by the prime minister. The scandal eventually led to the 14 October uprising that ended the military government and led to a three-year period of democratic rule. Illegal poaching by the rich and powerful is common in Thailand, said a spokesman for the Wildlife Friends Foundation. \\"The police, rich people and government officials do it all the time,\\" he said. \\"I think it's because rich people want to show off to their friends that they have barami (, social power), that they can afford to hunt because they have so much money.\\" History Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic stone tools have been found in the Khwae Noi and Khwae Yai river valleys and parts of the sanctuary were inhabited by Neolithic man. For at least 700 years, the Dawna-Tenasserim region has been home to Mon and Karen people, but burial grounds in Thung Yai and Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary have not been systematically researched. The Thai name \\"Thung Yai Naresuan\\" refers to the \\"big field\\" (thung yai) or savanna in the centre of the sanctuary, and to King Naresuan, a famous Siamese ruler who supposedly based his army in the area to wage war against Burma sometime during his reign of the Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1590 until his death in 1605. The Karen people who live in the sanctuary call the savanna pia aethala aethea which may be translated as \\"place of the knowing sage\\". It refers to the area as a place where ascetic hermits called aethea have lived and meditated and may do so even today. The Karen in Thung Yai regard them as holy men important for their history and identity in Thung Yai and revere them in a specific cult. Historical sources as well as local oral tradition suggest that settlement of Karen people in Thung Yai did not occur before the second half of the 18th century. At that time, due to political and religious persecution in Burma, predominantly Pwo-Karen from the hinterlands of Moulmein and Tavoy migrated into the area northeast of the Three Pagodas Pass, where they received formal settlement rights from the Siamese Governor of Kanchanaburi. Sometime between 1827 and 1839 the Siamese King Rama III established this area as a principality (mueang) and the Karen leader who governed the principality received the Siamese title of nobility Phra Si Suwannakhiri. During the second half of the 19th century, this Karen principality at the Burmese border became particularly important for the Siamese King Rama V (Chulalongkorn) in his negotiations with the British colonial power in Burma regarding the demarcation of their western border with Siam. At the beginning of the 20th century, when the modern Thai nation state was established, the Karen in Thung Yai lost their former status and importance. During the first half of the 20th century, external political influences were minimal in Thung Yai and the Karen communities were highly autonomous regarding their internal affairs. This changed in the second half of the 20th century, when the Thai nation state extended its institutions into the peripheral areas and the Karen re-appeared as chao khao or \\"hill tribes\\" on the national political agenda, as forest destroyers and illegal immigrants. Plans to protect the forests and wildlife at the upper Khwae Yai and Khwae Noi river grew in the mid-1960s. Due to strong logging and mining interests in the area, it was not before 1972 that the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary could be established, and Thung Yai resistance was even stronger. However, in April 1973 a military helicopter crashed near Thung Yai and revealed an illegal hunting party of senior military officers with family members, businessmen, and a film star, arousing nationwide public outrage which finally led to the fall of the Thanom-Prapas Regime after the uprising of 14 October 1973. After this accident and under a new democratic government, the area finally could be declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1974. After the military had taken power once again in October 1976, many of the activists of the democracy movement fled into peripheral regions of the country and some of them found refuge among the Karen people living in Thung Yai. During the 1960s, not only timber and ore, but also the water of the western forests as hydroelectric power resources became of interest for commercial profit and national development. A system of several big dams was planned to produce electricity for the growing urban centres. On the Khwae Yai River the Si Nakharin Dam was finished in 1980 and the Tha Thung Na Dam in 1981, while the Khao Laem Dam (renamed Vajiralongkorn Dam) on the Khwae Noi River south of Thung Yai was completed in 1984. The Nam Choan Dam, the last of the projected dams, was supposed to flood a forest area of about 223 km2 within the Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary. A public dispute about the Nam Choan Dam project lasted for more than six years, dominating national politics and public debate in early-1988 before it was shelved in April that year. Pointing to the high value of Thung Yai for nature conservation and biodiversity, dam opponents on the national and international level raised the possibility of declaring the area a world heritage site. This prestigious option would have been lost with a huge dam and reservoir in the middle of the two wildlife sanctuaries most promising to meet the requirements for a global heritage. After the dam project was shelved, the proposal to UNESCO was written by Seub Nakhasathien and another outspoken opponent of the Nam Choan Dam, and, in December 1991, Thung Yai Naresuan together with the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was declared a Natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In the nomination, the \\"outstanding universal value\\" of the two sanctuaries is, in first place, justified with their extraordinary high biodiversity due to their unique position at the junction of four biogeographic zones, as well as with its size and \\"the undisturbed nature of its habitats\\". The death of Seub Nakhasathien, the forest conservator instrumental in the UNESCO listing who committed suicide in 1990, transformed the status of Thung Yai Naresuan and the adjacent Huay Kha Kaeng Complex into a sacrosanct site and inspired many young persons to become forest patrol staff. Even though the UNESCO nomination explicitly emphasizes the \\"undisturbed nature\\" of the area, and notwithstanding scientific studies supporting traditional settlement and use rights of the Karen people in Thung Yai as well as the sustainability of their traditional land use system and their strong intention to remain in their homeland and to protect it, governmental authorities regard the people living in Thung Yai as a threat to the sanctuary and pursue their resettlement. Karen villages in Huai Kha Khaeng were removed when the sanctuary was established in 1972, and in the late-1970s the remaining communities in Huai Kha Khaeng had to leave when the Si Nakharin Dam flooded their settlement areas. During the 1980s and early-1990s, villages of the Hmong ethnic minority group were removed from the Huai Kha Khaeng and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuaries. The resettlement of the remaining Karen in Thung Yai was announced in the management plan for the sanctuary, drafted in the late-1980s, as well as in the proposal for the world heritage site. But, when the Thai Royal Forest Department tried to remove them in the early-1990s, it had to reverse the resettlement scheme due to strong public criticism. Since then, the authorities have used repression, intimidation, and terror to convince the Karen to leave their homeland \\"voluntarily\\", and placed restrictions on their traditional land use system which will inevitably cause its breakdown and deprive the Karen of subsistence. the sanctuary employs about 200 staff to care for more than 1.3 million rai (2,080 km2). The sanctuary is larger than the total area of Bangkok, which is 98,000 rai in size. There are 25 ranger stations inside the sanctuary. Each station is assigned three firearms, some inoperable. Sanctuary staff patrol some 12,000 km of forest paths, and another 10,000 km in the adjoining Huai Kha Khaeng sanctuary. The Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) calculates that each forest staffer needs to police 2,083 rai (3.3 km2). In Thailand overall there are 443 protected forest zones totalling 66.3 million rai, or 20.68 percent of the country's total area. The government allocates a budget of around 61 baht per rai to manage them.

As Buick's first two-seater and its first convertible since the 1985 Riviera, the Reatta was manufactured in a highly specialized assembly program at the Reatta Craft Center (later known as the Lansing Craft Center) in Lansing, Michigan--achieving production of over 21,000 units in four years. The presence of the Chevrolet Corvette, Pontiac Fiero, Pontiac Firebird, Cadillac Allant√© and Oldsmobile Toronado at the time of the Reatta's introduction meant that all of GM's passenger-car divisions offered at least one sporty coupe during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Overview Assembly at the Reatta Craft Center was performed at a series of stations each with a specialized team of workers, rather than on a conventional assembly line. After a team had completed their portion of the assembly, the car would be moved by robots to the next station. Paintwork was performed on site under subcontract to PPG Industries. The Reatta used GM's transverse \\"Buick 3800\\" V6 with 165‚Äì170 hp (123‚Äì127 kW) and 210‚Äì220 lb¬∑ft (285‚Äì298 N¬∑m) of torque with the highest output in the last year of production. The car sported a fully independent suspension, 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS, and front wheel drive. Top speed was electronically limited to 125 mph (201 km/h). The Reatta was rated at 18 mpg (13.1 L/100 km) in the city and 27 mpg (8.7 L/100 km) on the highway. The Reatta was intended as a halo car for Buick with projected production of 20,000 units a year. GM announced the end of production in early 1991. Features Rear view (1988 coupe) The Reatta featured twin bucket seats with a storage area behind the seats featuring two lockable bins and a lockable access hatch to the rear trunk. At introduction, options included 16-way power seats in lieu of 6-way power seats, side moldings in either black or body color and pinstripe delete. A sunroof became optional in late 1988, and in 1989 keyless entry was added as a standard feature. Reatta had the distinction of being Buick's only car with pop-up headlamps with entire headlamp assembly moving up and down. The other Buick cars with hidden headlamps, Riviera (1965‚Äì1969) and Skyhawk (1987‚Äì1989 for certain trim levels), had the fixed headlamps hidden behind the moveable covers. Initially (1988-89), the Reatta featured a touchscreen computer interface, marketed as the Electronic Control Center (ECC), that included radio and climate control functions, date reminder, trip computer, user- configurable overspeed alarm as well as diagnostic access to the vehicle's electronic systems and sensors. Later models were equipped with conventional push button stereo and climate controls. The new system eliminated trip computer functionality and the climate control buttons could access diagnostic information, replacing diagnostic scanner capability formerly provided by the touchscreen. In 1990, the interior was redesigned, adding a driver's airbag and an optional CD player. In 1991, the \\"L27\\" 3800 engine and 4T60-E transmission replaced the \\"LN3\\" and hydraulic 4T60 units and the Reatta received a new ABS system, new 16\\" wheels, automatic headlamps and a cup holder built into the armrest. Each Reatta included a leather book containing the owner's manual and pen. In 1990 and 1991, a zippered owners folio was included holding the owners manual, pen, flashlight, tire gauge as well as a \\"Craftsman's Log\\" with the signatures of the supervisors for the car's assembly. 1991 Buick Reatta coupe, with the model year specific 16-inch wheels In 1988, approximately fifty five examples were designated \\"Select Sixties\\" and allocated to Buick's top sixty. The models, internally designated model X22, featured a black exterior, tan interior and unique special Select Sixty hood emblem. In 1990, the Select Sixty program was repeated, as sixty five white convertibles including special emblems, and a flame red interior with white bucket seats, white 16 inch wheels, and cup holder. Convertible After a delayed introduction due to design difficulties, Buick introduced the convertible Reatta in 1990 with a manually-operated top designed by ASC, available in vinyl or cloth with a glass rear window and electric defroster. When retracted, the top was protected by a rigid tonneau cover. The 1991 models featured power pull-down motors to assist in tightening the rear bow of the top to the tonneau cover. A Buick convertible would not be offered again until the four-seat Buick Cascada debuted in 2016. 1990 Buick Reatta convertible Production Buick Reatta emblem The first pilot car was finished at the Reatta Craft Centre in December 1986. Series production began in January 1988 and ended on May 10, 1991. The original car was sometimes referred to as a \\"1988¬Ω model year\\", owing to its January introduction. However, various accounts of much earlier and later cars exist, and the handbuilt nature of the car and long development cycle makes accurately dating production difficult. {class=wikitable !Year!!4EC97 Coupe!!4EC67 Convertible!!Total!!Notes |- align=right |1988||4,708||0||4,708||align=left|First year.

He was the first president of the American Philological Association and editor-in-chief of The Century Dictionary. Life William Dwight Whitney was born in Northampton, Massachusetts on February 9, 1827. His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney (1786‚Äì1869) of the New England Dwight family. His mother was Sarah Williston (1800‚Äì1833) of Easthampton, Massachusetts. Whitney entered Williams College at fifteen, graduating in 1845. He continued studying and worked at a bank in Northampton for several years. He was at first interested in natural sciences, and assisted his older brother Josiah Whitney on a geological survey of the Lake Superior region in 1849, having charge of the botany, the barometrical observations and the accounts. On this expedition, he began the study of Sanskrit in his leisure hours. Around this time Whitney was living at Yale University in Connecticut. In 1850 Whitney left the United States to study philology, and especially Sanskrit, in Germany. There, he spent his winters at Berlin studying under Franz Bopp and Albrecht Weber, and his summers were devoted to research under Rudolph von Roth at T√ºbingen. It was during his time in Germany that Whitney began a major life project, \\"preparation of an edition and translation of the Atharva-veda.\\" He gained wide reputation for his scholarship in the field. In 1853, Yale University offered Whitney a position as \\"Professor of Sanskrit\\", a position made just for him and the first of its kind in the United States. It was not until 1861, however, that he received his doctoral degree from the University of Breslau. He also taught modern languages at the Sheffield Scientific School, and served as secretary to the American Oriental Society from 1857 until he became its president in 1884. On August 28, 1856 Whitney married Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin. She was the daughter of Roger Sherman Baldwin, US Senator and Governor of the State of Connecticut. They had six children: # Edward Baldwin Whitney was born August 16, 1857, became Assistant US Attorney General, and had son mathematician Hassler Whitney. #Williston Clapp Whitney was born April 2, 1859 but died March 11, 1861. # Marian Parker Whitney was born February 6, 1861, became a professor of German at Vassar College and trustee of Connecticut College for Women # Roger Sherman Baldwin Whitney was born January 6, 1863, but died January 17, 1874. # Emily Henrietta Whitney was born August 29, 1864. # Margaret Dwight Whitney was born November 19, 1866. He died at his home, on Whitney Avenue, on June 7, 1894. Career Whitney revised definitions for the 1864 edition of Webster's American Dictionary, and in 1869 became a founder and first president of the American Philological Association. In the same year he also became Yale's professor of comparative philology. Whitney also gave instruction in French and German in the college until 1867, and in the Sheffield scientific school until 1886. He wrote metrical translations of the Vedas, and numerous papers on the Vedas and linguistics, many of which were collected in the Oriental and Linguistic Studies series (1872‚Äì74). He wrote several books on language, and grammar textbooks of English, French, German, and Sanskrit. His Sanskrit Grammar (1879) is notable in part for the criticism it contains of the Ashtadhyayi, the Sanskrit grammar attributed to Panini. Whitney describes the Ashtadhyayi as \\"containing the facts of the language cast into the highly artful and difficult form of about four thousand algebraic-like rules (in the statement and arrangement of which brevity alone is had in view at the cost of distinctness and unambiguousness).\\" In his Course in General Linguistics in the chapter on the 'Immutability and Mutability of the Sign', Ferdinand de Saussure credits Whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of linguistic signs. The linguist Roman Jakobson (Jakobson 1965, 23-4) remarks that Whitney exerted a deep influence on European linguistic thought by promoting the thesis of language as a social institution. In his fundamental books of the 1860s and 70's, language was defined as a system of arbitrary and conventional signs. This doctrine was borrowed and expanded by Ferdinand de Saussure, and it entered into the posthumous edition of his 'Course', adjusted by his disciples C. Bally and Albert Sechehaye (1916). The teacher declares: \\"On the essential point it seems to us that the American linguist is right: language is a convention, and the nature of the sign that is agreed upon remains indifferent.\\" Jakobson writes, Arbitrariness is posited as the first of two basic principles for defining the nature of the verbal sign: \\"The bond uniting the signifier with the signified is arbitrary.\\" The commentary points out that no one has controverted this principle \\"but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it the appropriate place.\\" Jakobson, R. (1965) 'Quest for the Essence of Language', Diogenes, 13(21): pp. 21-37 Although he suffered from a heart ailment in his later years, he was editor-in-chief of the first edition of the respected Century Dictionary, which appeared from 1889 to 1891.

It is the centre of an agricultural district, the Agro Aversano, producing wine and cheese (famous for the typical buffalo mozzarella). Aversa is also the main seat of the faculties of Architecture and Engineering of the Seconda universit√† degli studi di Napoli (Second University of Naples). With a population of 52,974 (2017), it is the second city of the province after Caserta. Geography Aversa is located near the city of Naples, from which it is separated by only 24 km from Naples and only 26 km from Caserta, the administrative centre of the province to which it belongs. The municipality borders with Carinaro, Casaluce, Cesa, Frignano, Giugliano in Campania, Gricignano di Aversa, Lusciano, San Marcellino, Sant'Antimo, Teverola and Trentola Ducenta. It is located in a fertile coastal plain north of Naples, thus serving as a market for agricultural products to the city. The plain on which it sits was known in ancient Roman times as the Campania Felix. History Norman relief of St. George and the Dragon in the Duomo reflects its Scandinavian precedents via Norman culture. Prehistory Although some archaeological sites excavated near Aversa have revealed human presence in the area since the Neolithic period, the first known inhabitants in the area were the Liburnians, people related to the Illyrians, whose territory was bounded on the south by Naples, west by the Tyrrhenian Sea and north along the Clanio river. However, some say that the founding of the city took place with the Etruscans. In any case, because of endemic malaria that ravaged the region, the primitive city was abandoned. Lower middle ages Only a small military fortification, a castellum, still stands in the area, which is linked to a chapel in memory of the current alleged passage through Aversa by the Apostle Paul in the year 61. A.D., via the Roman road that ran towards Rome. Aversa County :See also List of Counts of Aversa. Aversa, which replaced the nearby city of Atella that had been laid waste during the Gothic Wars, was the first of the Norman territories in the Mediterranean. In 1030, the site was ceded to Rainulf Drengot, a cadet of the lords of Quarrel near Alen√ßon in Normandy; he was invested as count by Duke Sergius IV of Naples and confirmed by Emperor Conrad II. By offering a generous principle of asylum for the persecuted, Rainulf enlarged the power and importance of his little borgo, which became the base from which the Normans forged a state in Sicily and Italy. The diplomacy of Robert Guiscard, who built the fortifications, led to the investiture of a bishop responsible to the Pope at Aversa, which was nominally territory of the Eastern Emperor.The former seat had been at Atella (CE); Atella remains a titular bishopric today (Catholic-hierarchy.com). One of the first bishops was the Norman Guitmund (died c. 1090-95), a Benedictine monk, theologian, and opponent of Berengar of Tours. The count of Aversa, Richard I, was one of the chief leaders in the struggle against the Papal forces which culminated in the Battle of Civitella del Fortore (1053) in Beneventan territory; even Pope Leo IX himself was captured at what turned into a rout in favour of the Normans. The astute Richard did not treat the pope as a prisoner, however, but escorted him back to Rome with full honours, a gesture that led to the conciliation of the Normans with the Church, the lifting of the ban of excommunication that had been laid upon Aversa. Angevins After the Norman dynasty Aversa declined in importance: the Angevin kings of Naples came to Aversa mostly to hunt and hold court in the citadel, of which a few traces remain in via Roma in Aversa's historic centre. In particular Queen Joanna I chose Aversa for her preferred seat. There a group of nobles threw her husband Andrew from a window with a rope around his neck. His brother, King Louis I of Hungary, head of the Capetian House of Anjou, marched into Italy and at Aversa took his vengeance at a banquet of reconciliation, as Joanna escaped to Avignon. The presence of the court also benefitted Aversa by the institution of the Real Casa dell'Annunziata (about 1315) an orphanage and hospice that occupied a central place in Aversan public life. Crown of Aragon When Alfonso V of Aragon permanently enthroned the kingdom of Naples within the domains of the Crown of Aragon, Aversa continued to maintain the privileges it had enjoyed. Soon the epidemics and subdivisions of land caused it to be relegated as a peripheral urban center of Naples. Fifteenth century In the fourteenth or fifteenth century the County of Aversa was taken over by a family from Valencia, the Pr√≤ixida. In fact, the palace of the Count of Almenara in Almenara (Castell√≥n) is also known as the palace of the Count of Aversa.

Grapes destined for DOC product must be harvested to a maximum yield of 14 tonnes/hectare with the finished wines fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 10.5% for still and 11% for the spumante style.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 124 Firefly Books 2004 The primary grape variety of the region is the Asprinio which must constitute at least 85% of the wines, with other local white grape varieties, such as Fiano, Trebbiano and Greco permitted to fill in the remainder. Viticulture in Aversa is unique for its use of growing the grapevines with poplar trees acting as trellises. This traditional method of trellising means that almost all harvesting is done by hand.

Biography Benn was born Caroline Middleton DeCamp in Cincinnati, Ohio, the eldest daughter of Anne Hetherington (Graydon) and James Milton DeCamp, a lawyer. She came from a privileged background. Educated at Vassar College (BA, 1946) and the University of Cincinnati (BA, 1948), she travelled to the United Kingdom in 1948 to study at Oxford University and voted for Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party candidate in that year's American Presidential election. She gained an English MA on Jacobean drama (specifically on the masques of Inigo Jones) at University College London in 1951. She met Benn over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949, and just nine days later he proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it in the garden of their house in Holland Park. In June 1999, on their golden wedding anniversary, she put on the red striped dress she had worn that night. She had four children ‚Äì Stephen, Hilary, Melissa and Joshua ‚Äì and ten grandchildren. Benn devoted her life to comprehensive education and was co-founder of the Campaign for Comprehensive Education. She sent her own children to Holland Park School, one of the first comprehensive schools in the country. In 1970, she wrote alongside Professor Brian Simon, Halfway There ‚Äì the definitive study of the progress of comprehensive reform in the UK. This was followed up in 1997 with Thirty Years On, which she co-wrote with Professor Clyde Chitty. Her widely respected and authoritative biography of the Labour founder Keir Hardie was published in 1992. As well as writing extensively about education, Benn held a number of other positions: She was a member of the Inner London Education Authority from 1970‚Äì77, an ILEA Governor at Imperial College London, a tutor at the Open University, a lecturer at Kensington and Hammersmith Further Education College from 1970‚Äì96, a governor of Holland Park School for thirty-five years (serving thirteen of those as Chair of the Governors), and President of the Socialist Education Association. Benn played an important role in her husband's political career. She was popular with his colleagues and her views were respected. She is personally credited with having suggested the title of the Labour Party manifesto for the 1964 general election; she proposed The New Britain, and it eventually became Let's Go With Labour for the New Britain. She supported her husband's proposals in the 1980s for Labour's leadership and direction. However, she was also able to provide constructive criticism throughout his political career, such as his 1998 ITN documentary. Benn was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 1996, having been unwell for about a year, but fought the illness for several further years. She became increasingly frail during 2000, having developed spinal metastases, and died at Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 22 November 2000. A Tribute to Caroline Benn: Education and Democracy, edited by her daughter and Clyde Chitty, was published in 2004, featuring essays on her life and on educational reform and her life's work.

Giles's cartoons appeared in the Daily Express newspaper and used his cartoon family to illustrate and comment on topics of the day. 'Grandma' seated with knitting appeared in November 1947. His cartoon style was a single topical highly detailed panel, usually with a great deal more going on than the single joke. Certain recurring characters achieved a great deal of popularity, particularly the extended Giles family, which first appeared in a published cartoon on 5 August 1945 and featured prominently in the strip. Of these, the most remembered is the enigmatic matriarch of the family, known simply as Grandma. Another recurring favourite was Chalkie, the tyrannical school teacher who Giles claimed was modelled on one of his childhood teachers, and Larry, the mop-haired child from next door, often seen with a camera. Early life Giles was born in Islington, London, the son of a tobacconist and a farmer's daughter. He was nicknamed \\"Karlo\\", later shortened to \\"Carl\\", by friends who decided he looked like Boris Karloff, a lifelong nickname. He was actually registered with that name when he died in 1995. After leaving school at the age of 14 he worked as an office boy for Superads, an advertising agency that commissioned animated films from cartoonists like Brian White and Sid Griffiths' animation company also based in Charing Cross Road, London from 1929. When Superads closed in 1931, he gained experience in other small film companies in the area before being promoted to an animator in 1935, beginning to work for producer Alexander Korda on a colour cartoon film, The Fox Hunt. Giles then went to Ipswich to join Roland Davies, who was setting up a studio to produce animated versions of his popular newspaper strip \\"Come On Steve\\". Six ten-minute films were produced, beginning with Steve Steps Out (1936), but even though Giles was the head animator, he received no screen credit. Career In 1937, Giles started work as a cartoonist for the left-wing Sunday newspaper Reynolds News, for which he drew a weekly topical cartoon and a comic strip, \\"Young Ernie\\". His strip came to the attention of the editor of the Sunday Express and in 1943 he was interviewed for a job on the Evening Standard, but was eventually offered a job on the Daily Express and Sunday Express instead, at a higher salary of 20 guineas per week, and he quit Reynolds News. His first cartoon for his new employers appeared in the 3 October 1943 edition of the Sunday Express. Giles later said that he never agreed with the Daily Expresss politics, and felt guilt for abandoning the more left-wing Reynolds News for it, but it made him wealthy: by 1955 he was being paid ¬£8,060 per annum (equivalent to about ¬£200,000 at 2018 prices) for producing three cartoons a week. The Express cartoonist Giles sketches as Cromwell tank crewmen work on their vehicles, 1 May 1945. Giles was rejected for war service for being blind in one eye and deaf in one ear following a motorcycle accident, but made animated shorts for the Ministry of Information, while some of his cartoons were reprinted in poster form for the Railway Executive Committee and others. In 1945 he became the Daily Expresss \\"War Correspondent Cartoonist\\" with the 2nd Army. At one point during World War II he was assigned as War Correspondent to the Coldstream Guards unit which liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Giles interviewed the camp commandant, Josef Kramer, who turned out to be aware of and an admirer of Giles's work. Kramer gave Giles his Walther P38 pistol and holster, a ceremonial dagger, and his swastika armband, in return asking for a signed original of Giles's work. Giles said: :I have to say, that I quite liked the man. I am ashamed to say such a thing. But had I not been able to see what was happening outside the window I would have said he was very civilised. Odd, isn't it? But maybe there was a rather dishonourable reason. I have always found it difficult to dislike someone who was an admirer of my work. And strangely, Kramer was. I never sent him an original. What was the point? He had been hanged. The pistol and armband as well as the whip carried by Irma Grese were later given by Giles to a private collector in Suffolk. In 1959 he was awarded an OBE. Among his fans were the British Royal Family, who often requested the originals of his work. Giles's cartoons feature many references to news items, some even quoting a news headline. The topics were typically British and made references to common British goods or attitudes. For example, a cartoon published in 1985 involves a cleaner who has \\"left her box of Persil just behind the throne\\" and knocks to be let back in to get it, upon which she is mistaken for Black Rod. Giles finally quit working for The Daily Express in 1989; his cartoons had been allocated less and less space in the newspaper, and he said that the last straw was being stood up following a trip to London to lunch with the editor. He continued working for the Sunday Express until 1991. He never actually sold any of his creations, preferring to donate them to friends and to charitable organisations, like the RNLI, of which he was Life President and which continues to issue charity Christmas cards each year bearing his work. He also contributed cartoons to Men Only and other publications, drew advertising cartoons for Guinness, Fisons and other companies, and designed Christmas cards for the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and Game Conservancy Research Fund. Personal life Giles married Sylvia 'Joan' Clarke, his first cousin, on 14 March 1942 in East Finchley. The couple never had children but were married for over 50 years and shortly after their marriage the couple moved to Witnesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, where they spent the rest of their lives together. The last decade of Giles's life was plagued with failing health, including sight loss and encroaching deafness, and in 1990 he suffered the amputation of both legs due to poor circulation issues. He was reported to have never got over the death of his wife, on Christmas Day 1994, and died himself just over eight months later at Ipswich Hospital on 27 August 1995 aged 78. Annual collections of cartoons Collections of Giles's cartoons have been produced annually since 1946. Up until the 50th collection (published in 1996), they were given the title \\"1st Series\\", \\"2nd Series\\", up to \\"60th Series\\" (2007), although since the 1997-published collection, they have been called \\"The 1998 collection\\", \\"The 1999 collection\\", etc. For reasons unknown the 2005 Collection was subtitled as Fifty-Sixth series, despite the 2003 edition being (correctly) titled as such and the 2005 release actually being the Fifty Eighth book. Until his death in 1995, Giles selected which cartoons would be in the annual. Up until 1991, when Giles stopped producing new cartoons, the annual consisted of cartoons from the preceding year ‚Äî for example, in the 42nd series (published in autumn 1989), the cartoons used were originally published in the Daily Express and Sunday Express between 30 June 1987 and 12 June 1988. From 1991, the annuals consisted of cartoons previously published in collections, although some previously unpublished in annuals were included. The 46th series (1992), 47th (1993) and the 1999-2001 collections are all composed solely of cartoons which had not previously been published in any other collection. The 2002-2006 collections included some cartoons not previously published in any collections. The 1999-2005 collections included a calendar, with 12 cartoons from the year's collection. Most of the annuals included a foreword from an editor of the Express newspapers or a celebrity fan, including Margot Fonteyn (ballet dancer), Adam Faith (singer), Spike Milligan (comedian), Sir Malcolm Sargent (conductor), Jim Clark (F1 champion), Sean Connery (actor), Frank Sinatra (singer) and Tommy Cooper (comedian and magician). The 2010 collection had an introduction about Giles, as it was the first year that Hamlyn had published the collection (all previous collections had been published by Express Newspapers). The 2011 collection returned to the tradition of having an introduction written by a celebrity fan (in that case, Lee Latchford-Evans) and the majority of the cartoons featured in the 2011 collection had never previously appeared in an annual. In June 2017, Dr Tim Benson published the first biography of Giles to be based on the cartoonist's own correspondence in his book 'Giles's War'. Benson discovered that Giles had been dishonest about his reasons for leaving Reynolds News due to the guilt he felt over joining Express Newspapers. The book also discusses how Giles misled his biographer Peter Tory over many details of his career. Influences Giles cited his influences as Bruce Bairnsfather and Graham Laidler (\\"Pont\\"), and he himself influenced the style of the newspaper cartoonists \\"JAK\\" and \\"Mac\\". Giles' cartoon 'Back to School Week' of 13 January 1953 inspired Leo Baxendale to create the 'Bash Street Kids' for The Beano comic. In April 2000, he was voted 'Britain's Favourite Cartoonist of the 20th Century'. Tributes Bronze statue depicting Giles's character \\"Grandma\\" in Ipswich, England.

Institution History ICU was founded in 1949. With an emphasis on reconciliation and peace, ICU was envisaged as a ‚ÄúUniversity of Tomorrow,‚Äù a place where Japanese and international students would live together and learn to serve the needs of an emerging, more interconnected world. When students enter ICU they sign the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and they are challenged to commit themselves to help bring about social justice and world peace. Due to this commitment to human rights, Eleanor Roosevelt delivered ICU's first convocation address. According to JICUF (Japan ICU Foundation), > \\"Concerted fundraising campaigns were initiated in both Japan and in North > America. Hisato Ichimada, the Governor of the Bank of Japan who was > Buddhist, headed the Japan campaign that raised the funds necessary to > purchase a large tract of land for the university.

Campus ICU's main campus of 150 wooded acres is located in Western Tokyo, with downtown areas like Shinjuku about half an hour's train ride away. Computer and internet access is available throughout the campus. The campus sits on ancient pre-Jomon and Jomon archaeological remains, which gives students the opportunity to participate in archaeological fieldwork. Excavated items found on the campus are on permanent display in the Hachiro Yuasa Memorial Museum. In addition, the campus is directly on the former location of a Nakajima Aircraft Company factory. In a quiet wooded area of the campus and through a large thatched gate is the Taizanso Garden. Built in the 1920s, the garden includes a traditional Japanese tea house and the historically significant One-Mat Room constructed out of wood gathered from sacred and historic sites throughout Japan. ICU owns a campus in Nasu and a retreat center in Karuizawa, Kitasaku District, Nagano Prefecture. ICU houses one of the Rotary Centers for International Studies in peace and conflict resolution, partnering with Rotary International. The University of California Tokyo Study Center which hosts the UCEAP program to Japan is also located on ICU campus.

The main building was used by Mitaka Institute of the Nakajima Aircraft Company. ICU offers bachelor's degrees in liberal arts fields, as well as master's and doctoral degrees in education, public administration, comparative culture and the natural sciences. About 18% of the faculty come from overseas (primarily English-speaking countries). There is a strong English language program (ELP), taught by tenured and contract faculty English teachers, which was embroiled in a contentious curricular reform in 2010 leading to the name being changed to the ELA (English for Liberal Arts program) in April 2012. Academics who aspire to teach at ICU are required to submit a reference who can testify to their commitment to Christianity, despite the university' stance that increasing adherents to the Christian faith is not its primary goal.

Around 30% of all courses are offered in English, the rest in Japanese or in both languages. Prospective students without prior Japanese language knowledge are able to apply under a documentary screening process, instead of undergoing the entrance exams held in Japanese. These students are required to have college level English proficiency and subsequently take ICU Japanese Language Programs (JLP) courses to gain bilingualism and eventually take courses taught in Japanese. Under the policy of bilingualism of ICU curriculum, students take language courses for their non-dominant language in their freshman and sophomore year (Depending on the student's language requirements, English for Liberal Arts or Japanese Language Programs). Each campus department staffs employees with strong command in both languages. Student resources, ICU websites, and campus bulletin boards are in both Japanese and English to accommodate students from any language background.  Trimester System  The academic year is divided into trimesters of approximately eleven weeks each with each course lasting one trimester term. This allows for a dynamic learning experience, one where students can design their own curricula as their interests change and develop. Japan ICU Foundation The Japan ICU Foundation (JICUF) was incorporated in New York State on November 23, 1948 and helped to establish ICU in 1953. Today, the foundation maintains two non-profit corporations: The Japan ICU Foundation, Inc. and the JICUF Endowment, Inc. The Japan ICU Foundation supports ICU in a variety of ways, including providing scholarships, running a faculty exchange program, providing funding for international programs and projects and helping to fund new buildings on campus. The Foundation has offices in New York City. The current Executive Director of JICUF is Paul Hastings.https://www.jicuf.org/staff-trustees/  Research Institutes  ICU has eight research institutes as of 2016. In addition to research, these institutes plan and sponsor conferences, lectures, symposia and seminars as well as provide students with opportunities to meet distinguished scholars from Japan and overseas. * The Institute of Educational Research and Service (IERS) * The Social Science Research Institute (SSRI) * The Institute for the Study of Christianity and Culture (ICC) * The Institute of Asian Cultural Studies (IACS) * The Peace Research Institute (PRI) * The Research Center for Japanese Language Education (RCJLE) * The Institute for Advanced Studies of Clinical Psychology (IASCP) * The Center for Gender Studies (CGS) Student life Demographics As of 2011, ICU had 2851 undergraduates studying in the College of Liberal Arts, with a 1041 male students and 1810 female students. The ICU Graduate School had 150 students, with 64 men and 86 women. 90.5% of ICU's undergraduate and graduate students are Japanese citizens, and the remainder represent 44 countries. Many returnee Japanese students that have lived overseas, also known as kikokushijo (Â∏∞ÂõΩÂ≠êÂ•≥), make up the student body.https://www.icu.ac.jp/en//about/info/outline/Student.html The majority of ICU students live off-campus, either at home with their families or in apartments. As of 2010, about 600 students were living on campus.  International Education Exchange Programs  More than half of the students participate in study abroad programs during their time at ICU. The percentage of students who study abroad through ICU programs before they graduate is 55.5% (in 2014). Students who come from abroad to study at ICU on a year-long exchange program are referred to as OYRs (One Year Regulars). ICU Dining Hall The ICU Dining Hall, also known as Gakki („Ç¨„ÉÉ„Ç≠), is the official cafeteria of International Christian University. Rebuilt in 2010, Gakki is a public, self-service cafeteria and is one of the newest and most renowned buildings on campus. Student clubs/circles ICU students are known for their remarkable energy and initiative in creating a kaleidoscope of student- led and student-managed co-curricular activities. There are about 100 student- led clubs and organizations in the arts, sports, academic and social fields. New clubs are formed as student interest dictates, and most ICU students participate in one or more of these organizations.  After Graduation  As of 2016, 95.3% of ICU undergraduate alumni (students seeking employment) land a job right after graduation. ICU students have found employment in a wide range of industries, particularly with global companies. Over 20% of students go on to graduate school overseas and in Japan. Domestic and Overseas Universities include: International Christian University, University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Hitotsubashi University, University of Oxford, Columbia University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of London, Harvard University, and many more. Accreditation Accreditation actions had been taken at the American Academy for Liberal Education Board of Trustees Meeting at November 2005. * International Christian University, Tokyo, Japan - granted Programmatic Accreditation, through November 2015 ICU's academic programs of the College of Liberal Arts and the Graduate School are individually chartered by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). ICU has also received accreditation from the Japan University Accreditation Association (JUAA).https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/about/info/evaluation.html Academic rankings There are several rankings related to ICU, shown below. General rankings In 2019, ICU was ranked 11th among all universities in Japan, and 1st among private universities by Times Higher Education and Benesse. QS World University Rankings ranked ICU as 174th in Asia in 2016. Forbes made a list of top 10 liberal arts colleges in Asia including ICU that was based on the 2014 QS University rankings for Asia. Alumni rankings According to the Weekly Economist's () 2010 rankings and the () article on 2006/10/16, graduates from ICU have the 24th best employment rate in 400 major companies, and their average graduate salary is the 4th best in Japan.This 400 major companies exclude foreign companies, thus the ranking position tends to be lower for ICU which has many alumni who work in foreign companies Popularity and selectivity ICU is one of the most selective universities in Japan. Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as one of the top among 730 private universities. National and public universities use different kinds of exams. Thus it's only comparable between universities in the same category, e.g., published Hensachi (the indication showing the entrance difficulties by prep schools) rankings. Japanese journalist ranks its entrance difficulty as SA (most selective/out of 11 scales) in Japan, which includes only four private universities and 11 national universities.

Edited by Jess Stein, it contained 315,000 entries in 2256 pages, as well as 2400 illustrations. The CD-ROM version in 1994 also included 120,000 spoken pronunciations. History The Random House publishing company entered the reference book market after World War II. They acquired rights to the Century Dictionary and the Dictionary of American English, both out of print. Their first dictionary was Clarence Barnhart's American College Dictionary, published in 1947, and based primarily on The New Century Dictionary, an abridgement of the Century.Barbara Ripp Safford and Margaret Irby Nichols, eds. Guide to reference materials for school library media centers (1998), p. 217Kurt Vonnegut, Welcome to the monkey house: a collection of short works (1998), pp. 118‚Äì23 In the late 1950s, it was decided to publish an expansion of the American College Dictionary, which had been modestly updated with each reprinting since its publication. Under editors Jess Stein and Laurence Urdang, they augmented the American College Dictionary with large numbers of entries in all fields, primarily proper names, and published it in 1966 as The Random House Dictionary of the English Language: The Unabridged Edition. It was the first dictionary to use computers in its compilation and typesetting. In his preface to the 1966 edition, Stein argued (p. vi) that the Random House Dictionary steers \\"a linguistically sound middle course\\" between the \\"lexicographer's Scylla and Charybdis: should the dictionary be an authoritarian guide to 'correct' English or should it be so antiseptically free of comment that it may defeat the user by providing him with no guidance at all?\\" In 1982 Random House published The Random House ProofReader, a computer spell checker based on its dictionary. An expanded second edition of the printed dictionary, edited by Stuart Berg Flexner, appeared in 1987, revised in 1993. This edition adopted the Merriam-Webster Collegiate practice of adding dates for the entry of words into the language. Unlike the Collegiate, which cited the date of the first known citation, Random House indicated a range of dates. For example, where the Collegiate gave 1676, Random House might offer 1670‚Äì80. This second edition was described as permissive by in the Washington Post. Random House incorporated the name Webster's into the dictionary's title after an appeals court overturned an injunction awarded to Merriam Webster restricting the name's use.Merriam- Webster, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 35 F.3d 65 (2d Cir. 1994). The name Random House Webster's is now used on many Random House publications. In 2001, Random House published its Webster's Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, based on the Second Edition of the Random House Dictionary of the English Language. Versions of the dictionary have been published under other names, including Webster's New Universal Dictionary (which was previously the name of an entirely different dictionary), Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, and Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language.

Its name is also sometimies rendered in English as the Bavarian Council Republic;Kuhn, Gabriel ed. (2012) All Power to the Councils! A Documentary History of the German Revolution of 1918-1919, Oakland: PM Press. p.205 the German term R√§terepublik means a republic of councils or committees: council or committee is also the meaning of the Russian word soviet. It was established in April 1919 after the demise of Kurt Eisner's People's State of Bavaria and sought to establish a socialist soviet republic in Bavaria. It was overthrown less than a month later by elements of the German Army and the paramilitary Freikorps. Its collapse helped the Nazi Party in its subsequent rise to power. Background The roots of the republic lay in the German Empire's defeat in the First World War and the social tensions that came to a head shortly thereafter. From this chaos erupted the German Revolution of 1918. At the end of October 1918, German sailors began a series of revolts in Kiel and other naval ports. In early November, these disturbances spread civil unrest across Germany. On 7 November 1918, the first anniversary of the Russian revolution, King Ludwig III of Bavaria fled from the Residenz Palace in Munich with his family, and Kurt Eisner, a politician of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), became minister-president of a newly proclaimed People's State of Bavaria. Though he advocated a socialist republic, Eisner distanced himself from the Russian Bolsheviks, declaring that his government would protect property rights. As the new government was unable to provide basic services, Eisner's USPD was defeated in the January 1919 election, coming in sixth place. On 21 February 1919, as he was on his way to parliament to announce his resignation, he was shot dead by the right-wing nationalist Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, also known as Arco-Valley. After Eisner's assassination, the Landtag convened, and Erhard Auer - the leader of the Social Democrats and the Minister of the Interior in Eisner's government - began to eulogize Eisner, but rumours had already begun to spread that Auer was behind the assassination. Acting on these false allegations, Alois Linder, a saloon waiter who was a fervent supporter of Eisner, shot Auer twice with a rifle, seriously wounding him. This prompted other armed supporters of Eisner to open fire, causing a melee, killing one delegate and provoking nervous breakdowns in at least two ministers. There was effectively no government in Bavaria thereafter.Mitcham (1996), p.32 Unrest and lawlessness followed. The assassination of Eisner created a martyr for the leftist cause and prompted demonstrations, the closing of the University of Munich, the kidnapping of aristocrats, and the forced pealing of church bells. The support for the Left was greater than Eisner himself had been able to command. On 7 March 1919, the Socialists' new leader, Johannes Hoffman, an anti-militarist and former schoolteacher, patched together a parliamentary coalition government, but a month later, on the night of 6‚Äì7 April, Communists and anarchists, energized by the news of a left-wing revolution in Hungary, declared a Soviet Republic, with Ernst Toller as chief of state. Toller called on the nonexistent \\"Bavarian Red Army\\" to support the new dictatorship of the proletariat and ruthlessly deal with any counter-revolutionary behavior.M√ºhsam, Erich (1929) Von Eisner bis Levin√©, Berlin-Britz: Fanal Verlag p.47Mitcham (1996), pp.32-33 The Hoffmann government fled to Bamberg in Northern Bavaria, which it declared the new seat of government. Ernst Toller Ernst Toller government Initially, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was ruled by USPD members such as Ernst Toller, and anarchists like an anarchist writer Gustav Landauer, Silvio Gesell, and playwright Erich M√ºhsam. Toller, who was also a playwright, described the revolution as the \\"Bavarian Revolution of Love\\".Gaab (2006), p.59 Among the caf√© society of Schwabing, the new government became known as \\"the regime of the coffeehouse anarchists.\\"Evans, Richard J. (2003) The Coming of the Third Reich New York: Penguin. pp.158-161 Toller's government members were not always well-chosen. For instance, the Foreign Affairs Deputy Dr. Franz Lipp - who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals - declared war on W√ºrttemberg and Switzerland over the Swiss refusal to lend 60 locomotives to the Republic. He also claimed to be well acquainted with Pope Benedict XVNoske, Gustav (2015) Von Kiel bis Kapp, Vero Verlag. p.136 and informed Vladimir Lenin and the Pope by cable that the ousted former Minister- President Hoffmann had fled to Bamberg and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him.Fr√∂lich, Paul (2001) Die Bayerische R√§te-Republik. Tatsachen und Kritik. Cologne: Neuer Isp Verlag. p.144 Other Toller appointments included: as commissar for military affairs, a former waiter; a burglar with a conviction for moral turpitude as police president of Munich; as commissar for transportation a part-time railroad track maintenance worker; and - in Catholic Bavaria, where nuns ran the schools - a Jew as minister for education. Toller's minister for public housing published a decree saying that no house could thereafter contain more than three rooms and that the living room must always be above the kitchen and bedroom.Mitcham (1996), p.33 The new government reformed the arts and opened Munich University to everyone except those who wished to study history, which was deemed \\"hostile to civilization.\\" One minister declared that capitalism would be brought down by making money free. Eugen Levin√© government Eugen Levin√© On Saturday 12 April 1919, only six days into Toller's regime, the Communist Party seized power, led by three Russian √©migr√©s, with Eugen Levin√© as head of state.Bullock, Alan (1991) Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives New York: Knopf. p.70. Having received the blessings of Lenin - who at the annual May Day celebration in Red Square said \\"The liberated working class is celebrating its anniversary not only in Soviet Russia but in ... Soviet Bavaria\\" - Levin√© began to enact hardcore communist reforms, which included forming a \\"Red Army\\" from factory workers, seizing cash, food supplies, and privately owned guns, expropriating luxurious apartments and giving them to the homeless and placing factories under the ownership and control of their workers. One of Munich's main churches was taken over and made into a revolutionary temple dedicated to the \\"Goddess of Reason.\\" Bavaria was to be in the vanguard of the Bolshevization of Europe, with all workers to receive military training. Levin√© also had plans to abolish paper money and reform the education system but never had time to implement them. There was time, however, for Max Levien, following Lenin's orders, to arrest aristocrats and members of the upper-class as hostages. During Levin√©'s short reign, food shortages quickly became a problem, especially the absence of milk. Public criticism over the milk shortage turned political, precipitating the communist government to publicly declare: \\"What does it matter? ... Most of it goes to the children of the bourgeoisie anyway. We are not interested in keeping them alive. No harm if they die - they‚Äôd only grow into enemies of the proletariat.\\"Burleigh (2000), p.40 An attempt by troops loyal to the Hoffmann government, along with the Kampfbund (combat league) organized by the nationalist volkische Thule Society,Bracher (1970), p. 110 to mount a counter-coup and overthrow the BSR failed on 13 April, having been put down by the new Red Army, which consisted of factory workers and members of the soldiers' and workers' councils. Twenty men died in the fighting. Military clash and demise The rival governments - Hoffman's People's State of Bavaria seated in Bamberg, and the Bavarian Soviet Republic located in Munich - clashed militarily at Dachau on 18 April when Hoffman's 8,000 soldiers met the Soviet Republic's 30,000. The BSR forces - led by Ernst Toller - were victorious in the first battle at Dachau, but Hoffman made a deal that gave him the services of 20,000 men of the Freikorps under Lt. General Burghard von Oven. Oven and the Freikorps, along with Hoffman's loyalist elements of the German Army - called the \\"White Guards of Capitalism\\" by the communists - then took Dachau and surrounded Munich. Supporters of the BSR had, in the meantime, on 26 April, occupied the rooms of the Thule Society in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten, and arrested Countess Hella von Westarp, the society's secretary, and six others, to be held as hostages.Bracher (1970), pp.109-110 Egilhofer, panicked by Munich being surrounded by Hoffman's forces, had these seven and three other hostages executed on 30 April. They included the well-connected Prince Gustav of Thurn and Taxis.Timebase Multimedia Chronography. Timebase 1919 . Accessed September 23, 2006. The executions were carried out despite Toller's efforts to prevent them. The Freikorps broke through the Munich defenses on 1 May, leading to bitter street fighting that involved \\"flame-throwers, heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, even aircraft\\". At least 606 people were killed, of whom 335 were civilians.Kershaw (1999), p.112-116 Levin√© was later condemned to death for treason, and shot by a firing squad in Stadelheim Prison. Gustav Landauer was killed by the Freikorps, and they killed Egilhofer as well. Numerous others were given prison sentences, such as Toller (5 years) and the anarchist writer Erich M√ºhsam (15 years); others received longer sentences, 6,000 years' worth in all, some of it to hard labour. After the trials and the execution of 1,000-1,200 Communists and anarchists, Oven declared the city to have been secured on 6 May, ending the reign of the Bavarian Soviet Republic.Mitcham (1996), pp.34-35 Although the Hoffman government was nominally restored, the actual power in Munich had shifted to the Right.Shirer, William L. (1960) The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. New York: Simon and Schuster. p.33 The Bamberg Constitution was enacted on 14 August 1919, creating the Free State of Bavaria within the new Weimar Republic. Aftermath The immediate effect of the existence of the People's State of Bavaria and the Bavarian Soviet Republic was to inculcate in the Bavarian people hatred of left-wing rule. They saw the period in which these two states existed as one of privation and shortages, censorship and restrictions on their freedoms, and general chaos and disorder. It was seen as Schreckensherrschaft, the \\"rule of horror\\". These feelings were then constantly reinforced by right-wing propaganda not only in Bavaria but throughout the Reich, where \\"Red Bavaria\\" was held up as an object lesson in the horrors of Socialism and Communism. In this way, the radical right was able to provoke and feed the fears of the peasants and the middle class. The separate strands of Bavarian right-wing extremism found a common enemy in the Left, and Bavaria became profoundly \\"reactionary, anti- Republican, [and] counter-revolutionary.\\" The Left itself was decisively neutralized following the demise of the two socialist states, through the legacy of distrust between the Communist Party (KPD) and the Socialist Party (SPD). The SPD were fully aware that the Communists were controlled by Moscow; the KPD, under Moscow‚Äôs orders, regarded the Socialists as betrayers of the Revolution and portrayed them as the primary bourgeois threat to socialism in Germany. The hostility operated throughout Germany. The parties were unable to work together. This gave the advantage to the Nazi Party, since only a parliamentary coalition of the KPD and SPD could have prevented the Nazis from coming to power. However, even at the height of their influence in the Reichstag, they did not have enough delegates to resist such a coalition.Burleigh (2000), pp.40-41 Only President Paul von Hindenburg could have made the difference but he was in his dotage and largely insulated from current events. Notable people Active participants in the Freikorps units - those of Oven, Franz Ritter von Epp, and Hermann Erhardt - that suppressed the Bavarian Soviet Republic included many future powerful members of the Nazi Party, including Rudolf Hess, a member of the Freikorps Epp.Mitcham (1996), p.35Manvell, Roger and Fraenkel, Heinrich (1971) Hess: A Biography. London: MacGibbon & Kee. p.20. Padfield, Peter (2001) Hess: The Fuhrer's Disciple. London: Cassell & Co. p.13 One notable supporter of the Soviet Republic was the artist Georg Schrimpf, then aged 30, who was arrested when the movement was crushed. His friend, the writer Oskar Maria Graf, who was also arrested, wrote about the events in his autobiographical novel, Wir sind Gefangene (1927). Hitler's longstanding chauffeur and first leader of the Schutzstaffel (SS) Julius Schreck signed up and served as a member of the Red Army in late April 1919.Kershaw (1999), p.119 Balthasar Brandmayer, one of Hitler's closest wartime friends, remarked \\"how he at first welcomed the end of the monarchies\\" and the establishment of the republic in Bavaria. All the National Socialist officers subsequently became disillusioned after the demise of the socialist republic. Hitler himself acted as a liaison between his army battalion - he had been elected \\"deputy battalion representative\\" - and the Department of Propaganda of the soviet. Film footage and a still photograph appear to show Hitler marching in Eisner's funeral procession, although this evidence is not incomtrovetible. He wore both a black mourning band, and a red band showing support for the socialist government. It is uncertain whether this indicated that Hitler was a true supporter of the soviet, or that he was simply taking an available opportunity not to return to his pre-war life of poverty. His choice may have been a tactical one, and not one of political belief, especially considering that once the government had fallen, Hitler aligned himself with the counter-revolutionaries and - as part of a three-person committee assigned to investigate the behavior of his regiment's soldiers - informed on those who had shown sympathy for the revolution.Ullrich, Volker (2016) Hitler: Ascent 1889-1939.

It is most notable for releasing various unlicensed video games and accessories for the Nintendo Entertainment System, such as the Game Genie. History The company was owned and operated by David J. Harding and was originally formed in 1988 as a wholesale association with giftware such as Waterford Crystal and Blue Mountain Pottery. Later, the company entered the video game market, featuring Nintendo World Championship winner Thor Aackerlund as the spokesperson. The company created a number of early peripherals for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Aladdin Deck Enhancer expansion peripheral and Supersonic: the Joystick, a wireless controller. Camerica held the rights to publish most NES game titles from Codemasters, including those for the Deck Enhancer. Nintendo sued Camerica and their USA distributor, Galoob, many times. Camerica and Galoob prevailed every time. There were lawsuits in California, New York and Canada. In one case, Nintendo was ordered to pay Galoob in damages. Since Camerica still lacked Nintendo's license to produce NES games, they had to create their own cartridges that would bypass Nintendo's lock-out chip. Like the circuit used in Color Dreams cartridges, Camerica's workaround generates glitch pulses that freeze the lock-out chip. The cartridges they made are shaped and colored slightly differently from Nintendo's official cartridges, though they still fit in the NES. All Camerica cartridges were originally produced gold-colored, and later silver. They feature a switch for use with European NES consoles. Camerica released the Codemasters-designed Game Genie in Canada and the UK.

Education and early career  Penner was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Winnipeg alderman Jacob Penner (d. 1965) and Rose Shapack (d. 1970). His father was from a Mennonite background, and his mother was Jewish.http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/60/glowingdream.shtml He served in Europe during World War II in the Canadian artillery. At the end of the war, he earned credits at the Khaki University of Canada. He continued his education at the University of Manitoba, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949 and an LL.B. in 1961. He began working at the University of Manitoba in 1967, and became a professor in 1972. From 1972 to 1978, he was the president of Legal Aid Manitoba, and from 1979 to 1980, he was president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers. In 1949, he married Adeline (\\"Addie\\") Wdoviak, and in 1982, he married Janet Kay Baldwin.  Political career  Penner's parents and his older brother Norman were active in the communist Labor-Progressive Party. In the federal election of 1953, he ran as a candidate of the party in the predominantly middle-class riding of Winnipeg South Centre. He finished a poor fourth with only 504 votes. He also ran as an LPP candidate for school trustee in the Winnipeg municipal election of 1953. Penner left the Labour-Progressive Party in 1961, part of a mass exodus in the years following the Soviet invasion of Hungary and Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech on Stalin's crimes. His brother Norman had left in 1957, while his father Jacob remained a party member.Roland Penner, A Glowing Dream: A Memoir (Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford Publishing, 2007), pp. 171-173. Penner completed law school and practised criminal law for several years before becoming a law professor. In 1980, he announced that he would seek the nomination of the New Democratic Party in the riding of St. Johns in the 1981 election. There was some speculation that Penner's communist past would damage his political ambitions, especially as Winnipeg alderman Joe Zuken had lost a mayoral election the previous year when his communist politics became an issue. Penner rejected this suggestion, however, saying, \\"There's a fundamental difference between Joe and myself in that I'm not a member of the Communist Party. I'm a member of the NDP. [...] I was a member of the Communist Party at one time, but that's ancient history. That was twenty years ago. It may be raised but it's not relevant. It would ignore what I've been doing to the last two decades.\\"\\"Law professor seeks NDP nomination in St. Johns\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 October 1980, p. 13. He later chose not to run in St. Johns, and sought another riding. The party wanted him to run against Progressive Party leader Sid Green in the riding of Inkster. He declined and ran instead in Fort Rouge, where he defeated incumbent Liberal June Westbury. On November 30, 1981, Penner was appointed Government House Leader, chair of the Treasury Board and attorney general. He was also given ministerial responsibility for the Liquor Control Act on March 4, 1982, and stood down as Treasury Board Chair on July 28 of the same year. On November 4, 1983, he stood down as house leader and received the additional portfolio of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. Penner was easily re-elected in the 1986 election. He was retained as attorney general, and given responsibility for Constitutional Affairs and the Liquor Control Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on September 21, 1987, Penner was named Minister of Education, while retaining responsibility for constitutional matters. The New Democratic Party experienced a significant decline in its popularity between 1986 and 1988, and Penner was defeated in the 1988 provincial election. As attorney-general, Penner brought in the province's first human rights legislation. He also introduced freedom of information legislation and was responsible for implementing legislation requiring French language services after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province was violating its constitutional obligations. (The latter action resulted in a backlash in some parts of the province, leading to the rise of anti-bilingualism groups such as the Confederation of Regions Party). As minister responsible for constitutional affairs, Penner also participated in negotiations for what became the Meech Lake Accord. Although a supporter of abortion rights, Penner was required to uphold a decision by the Manitoba courts which prevented Henry Morgentaler from opening a private clinic in the province. Penner was also an early champion of including sexual orientation in Canada's human rights code. Because of his background in communist politics, Penner was for many years forbidden from entering the United States of America under the McCarran-Walter Act. Special provisions had to be made allowing him to enter America as a cabinet minister.  After politics  Following his loss, Penner returned to teaching at the University of Manitoba. He taught courses in constitutional law, criminal law, labour law, evidence, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He served as a University Dean between 1989 and 1994. He wrote several works, including a number on the privacy rights of Canadians. In 1993, he openly questioned the attempts of Bob Rae's New Democratic Party government in Ontario to restrict tenure to professors deemed to hold socially unacceptable views. He retired from teaching in 2009. In 2010, it was revealed that Penner's name was on a secret list of Communist sympathizers kept during the Cold War; these persons were to be watched by the RCMP and could have been detained at internment camps in the event of a national security crisis. In 2007, Penner published A Glowing Dream: A Memoir (Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford Publishing, 2007). In 2011, he co-wrote They Shoot Doctors Don't They: A Memoir with Jack Fainman.  Honours  In 2000, he was named to the Order of Canada. In 2014, he was made a member of the Order of Manitoba.

Plot summary As the story begins, Fred Platt, the main character, is about to place a telephone call to a college friend he hasn't seen in years. Platt, as the opening sentence indicates, comes from 'old money' -- he is three generations removed from its acquisition. He wants to acquire a job without the contaminating hand of his father's connections. Accordingly, he calls his old friend Clayton Thomas. Clayton is now an executive in the advertising wing of a large chemical company, hence the story's title. The drama in the story consists of Fred's horror at Clayton's gauche, new-money ways, a horror that he with some effort suppresses in the interest of asking Clayton for work. Some nice touches arise from Fred's brief conversations with each of the two secretaries through whom his phone call must pass before he can talk to Clayton. For example, the second secretary asks, \\"About what was it you wished to speak to him?\\" and one senses an earnest and newly educated woman's effort to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition.

D√ºbendorf Museum of Military Aviation A motor‚Äìgenerator (an M‚ÄìG set) is a device for converting electrical power to another form. Motor‚Äìgenerator sets are used to convert frequency, voltage, or phase of power. They may also be used to isolate electrical loads from the electrical power supply line. Large motor‚Äìgenerators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor‚Äìgenerators (such as the one shown in the picture) were used to convert battery power to higher DC voltages. While a motor‚Äìgenerator set may consist of distinct motor and generator machines coupled together, a single unit dynamotor (for dynamo‚Äìmotor) has the motor coils and the generator coils wound around a single rotor; both the motor and generator therefore share the same outer field coils or magnets.Radio Amateur's Handbook 1976, pub. ARRL, p331-332 Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator on one end of the shaft, while the generator coils provide output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a pair of machines, and does not require exposed drive shafts. Low-powered consumer devices such as vacuum tube vehicle radio receivers did not use expensive, noisy and bulky motor‚Äìgenerators. Instead, they used an inverter circuit consisting of a vibrator (a self-exciting relay) and a transformer to produce the higher voltages required for the vacuum tubes from the vehicle's 6 or 12 V battery. Electrical power handling In the context of electric power generation and large fixed electrical power systems, a motor‚Äìgenerator consists of an electric motor mechanically coupled to an electric generator (or alternator). The motor runs on the electrical input current while the generator creates the electrical output current, with power flowing between the two machines as a mechanical torque; this provides electrical isolation and some buffering of the power between the two electrical systems. One use is to eliminate spikes and variations in \\"dirty power\\" (power conditioning) or to provide phase matching between different electrical systems. Flywheel-generator Another use is to buffer extreme loads on the power system. For example, tokamak fusion devices impose very large peak loads, but relatively low average loads, on the electrical grid. The DIII-D tokamak at General Atomics, the Princeton Large Torus (PLT) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and the Nimrod synchrotron at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory each used large flywheels on multiple motor‚Äìgenerator rigs to level the load imposed on the electrical system: the motor side slowly accelerated a large flywheel to store energy, which was consumed rapidly during a fusion experiment as the generator side acted as a brake on the flywheel. Similarly, the next generation U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will use a flywheel motor‚Äìgenerator rig to supply power instantaneously for aircraft launches at greater than the ship's installed generator capacity. Conversions Electron Beam Welding Machine high voltage power supply. Motor‚Äìgenerators may be used for various conversions including: * Alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) * DC to AC * DC at one voltage to DC at another voltage. (Also called a dynamotor, short for dynamo-motor) * Creating or balancing a three- wire DC system. * AC at one frequency to AC at another harmonically-related frequency * AC at a fixed voltage to AC of a variable voltage * AC single- phase to AC three-phase Variable AC voltage power supply Before solid state AC voltage regulation was available or cost effective, motor generator sets were used to provide a variable AC voltage. The DC voltage to the generators armature would be varied manually or electronically to control the output voltage. When used in this fashion, the MG set is equivalent to an isolated variable transformer. High-frequency machines An Alexanderson alternator is a motor-driven, high-frequency alternator which provides radio frequency power. In the early days of radio communication, the high frequency carrier wave had to be produced mechanically using an alternator with many poles driven at high speeds. Alexanderson alternators produced RF up to 600 kHz, with large units capable of 500 kW power output. While electromechanical converters were regularly used for long wave transmissions in the first three decades of the 20th century, electronic techniques were required at higher frequencies. The Alexanderson alternator was largely replaced by the vacuum tube oscillator in the 1920s. Motor‚Äìgenerators used to increase ride- through Motor‚Äìgenerators have even been used where the input and output currents are essentially the same. In this case, the mechanical inertia of the M‚ÄìG set is used to filter out transients in the input power. The output's electric current can be very clean (noise free) and will be able to ride- through brief blackouts and switching transients at the input to the M‚ÄìG set. This may enable, for example, the flawless cut-over from mains power to AC power provided by a diesel generator set. The motor‚Äìgenerator set may contain a large flywheel to improve its ride-through; however, consideration must be taken in this application as the motor‚Äìgenerator will require a large amount of current on re-closure, if prior to the pull-out torque is achieved, resulting in a shut down. The in-rush current during re-closure will depend on many factors, however. As an example, a 250 kVA motor generator operating at 300 ampere of full load current will require 1550 ampere of in-rush current during a re-closure after 5 seconds. This example used a fixed mounted flywheel sized to result in a Hz per second slew rate. The motor‚Äìgenerator was a vertical type two-bearing machine with oil-bath bearings. Motors and generators may be coupled by a non-conductive shaft in facilities that need to closely control electromagnetic radiation,Physical Security Standard for Construction of Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities , DIANE Publishing, 1994 , page 27 or where high isolation from transient surge voltages is required. The motor‚Äìgenerator today Motor‚Äìgenerator sets have been replaced by semiconductor devices for some purposes. In the past, a popular use for MG sets was in elevators. Since accurate speed control of the hoisting machine was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC hoist motor was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC variable-frequency drives and compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than DC-powered machinery. Another use for MG sets was in the southern region of British Rail. They were used to convert the 600 V DC - 850 V DC line supply voltage from the third rail into 70 V DC to power the controls of the EMU stock in use. These have since been replaced with solid state converters on new rolling stock. Similarly, MG sets were used in the PCC streetcar to produce a 36VDC output from the 600VDC traction supply. The low voltage output charges the streetcar's batteries and supplies current for control and auxiliary equipment (including headlights, gong ringers, door motors and electromagnetic track brakes). On the other hand, in industrial settings where harmonic cancellation, frequency conversion, or line isolation is needed, MG sets remain a popular solution. A useful feature of motor‚Äìgenerators is that they can handle large short-term overloads better than semiconductor devices of the same average load rating. Consider that the thermally current-limited components of a large semiconductor inverter are solid-state switches massing a few grams with a thermal time constant to their heat sinks of likely more than 100 ms, whereas the thermally current limited components of an MG are copper windings massing some hundreds of kilograms which are intrinsically attached to their own large thermal mass. They also have inherently excellent resistance to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Modern use of the term In principle, any electrical generator can also serve as an electric motor, or vice versa. In hybrid vehicles and other lightweight power systems, a \\"motor‚Äìgenerator\\" is a single electric machine that can be used as an electric motor or a generator, converting between electrical power and mechanical power. From the 2014 season, Formula 1 racing cars will have two of what are described as 'motor-generator units' (MGU) This makes the cars more fuel- efficient by harvesting energy from the turbocharger and under braking. However these are not motor-generators as described here, but are more like dynamotors, single units which can act as either a generator or a motor. They can be used to provide an additional 160 BHP to the wheels to aid acceleration and overtaking, or can be used to spin the turbo to increase boost pressure faster, thereby reducing turbo lag.

Nature 400(6743): 446‚Äì449 (1999). In the anammox reaction, nitrite and ammonium ions are converted directly into Diatomic Nitrogen and water.

Globally, this process may be responsible for 30-50% of the N2 gas produced in the oceans. It is thus a major sink for fixed nitrogen and so limits oceanic primary productivity. The bacteria that perform the anammox process belong to the bacterial phylum Planctomycetes. Currently, five anammox genera have been discovered: Brocadia, Kuenenia, Anammoxoglobus, Jettenia (all fresh water species), and Scalindua (marine species).Jetten, M. S. M. et al. Biochemistry and molecular biology of anammox bacteria\\" Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 44(2-3), 65-84 (2009) The anammox bacteria are characterized by several striking properties: * They all possess one anammoxosome, a membrane bound compartment inside the cytoplasm which is the locus of anammox catabolism. Further, the membranes of these bacteria mainly consist of ladderane lipids so far unique in biology. * Of special interest is the conversion to hydrazine (normally used as a high-energy rocket fuel, and poisonous to most living organisms) as an intermediate. * A final striking feature of the organism is the extremely slow growth rate; the doubling time is anywhere from 7‚Äì22 days. The anammox bacteria are geared towards converting their substrates at very low concentrations; in other words, they have a very high affinity to their substrates ammonium and nitrite (sub-micromolar range). Anammox cells are packed with cytochrome c type proteins (‚âà30% of the protein complement), including the enzymes that perform the key catabolic reactions of the anammox process, making the cells remarkably red. The anammox process was originally found to occur only from 20 ¬∞C to 43 ¬∞C Strous, M., Kuenen, J.G., Jetten, M.S. 1999. Key Physiology of Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation. App. Environ. Microb. (3248-3250) but more recently, anammox has been observed at temperatures from 36 ¬∞C to 52 ¬∞C in hot springs and 60 ¬∞C to 85 ¬∞C at hydrothermal vents located along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. History Figure 2. The biological N cycle. DNRA, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. In 1932, it was reported that dinitrogen gas was generated via an unknown mechanism during fermentation in the sediments of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA.Allgeier, R. J. et al. The anaerobic fermentation of lake deposits. International Review of Hydrobiology 26(5-6), 444-461 (1932) In 1965, F. A. Richards noticed that most of the ammonium that should be produced during the anaerobic remineralization of organic matter was unaccounted for. As there was no known biological pathway for this transformation, biological anaerobic oxidation of ammonium received little further attention. In 1977, Engelbert Broda predicted the existence of two chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms capable of oxidizing ammonium to dinitrogen gas on the basis of thermodynamic calculations.Aharon Oren (2015): Anammox revisited: thermodynamic considerations in early studies of the microbial nitrogen cycle, FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2015 Aug;362(15):fnv114, . It was thought that anaerobic oxidation of ammonium would not be feasible, assuming that the predecessors had tried and failed to establish a biological basis for those reactions. By the 1990s, Arnold Mulder's observations were just consistent with Richard's suggestion. In their anoxic denitrifying pilot reactor, ammonium disappeared at the expense of nitrite with a clear nitrogen production. The reactor used the effluent from a methanogenic pilot reactor, which contained ammonium, sulphide and other compounds, and nitrate from a nitrifying plant as the influent. The process was named \\"anammox,\\" and was realized to have great significance in the removal of unwanted ammonium. The discovery of the anammox process was first publicly presented at the 5th European congress on biotechnology.A. A. van de Graaf, A. Mulder, H. Slijkhuis, L. A. Robertson, and J. G. Kuenen, \\"Anoxic ammonium oxidation,\\" in Proceedings of the 5th European Congress on Biotechnology, C. Christiansen, L. Munck, and J. Villadsen, Eds., pp. 338‚Äì391, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1990 By the mid-1990s, the discovery of anammox in the fluidized bed reactor was published.A. Mulder, A. A. Van De Graaf, L. A. Robertson, and J. G. Kuenen, \\"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation discovered in a denitrifying fluidized bed reactor,\\" FEMS Microbiology Ecology, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 177‚Äì184, 1995 A maximum ammonium removal rate of 0.4 kg N/m3/d was achieved. It was shown that for every mole of ammonium consumed, 0.6 mol of nitrate was required, resulting in the formation of 0.8 mol of N2 gas. In 1995 the biological nature of anammox was identified. Labeling experiments with 15NH4+ in combination with 14NO3‚àí showed that 14-15N2 was the dominant product making up 98.2% of the total labeled N2. It was realized that, instead of nitrate, nitrite was assumed as the oxidizing agent of ammonium in anammox reaction. Based on a previous study, Strous et al.M. Strous, J. J. Heijnen, J. G. Kuenen, and M. S. M. Jetten, \\"The sequencing batch reactor as a powerful tool for the study of slowly growing anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms,\\" Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, vol. 50, no. 5, pp. 589‚Äì596, 1998 calculated the stoichiometry of anammox process by mass balancing, which is widely accepted by other groups. Later, anammox bacteria were identified as planctomycetes,M. Strous, J. A. Fuerst, E. H. M. Kramer et al., \\"Missing lithotroph identified as new planctomycete,\\" Nature, vol. 400, no. 6743, pp. 446‚Äì449, 1999 and the first identified anammox organism was named Candidatus \\"Brocadia anammoxidans.\\"J.

In 2002 however, anammox was found to play an important part in the biological nitrogen cycle, accounting for 24-67% of the total N2 production in the continental shelf sediments that were studied.

Light blue diamonds, cytochromes; blue arrows, reductions; pink arrows, oxidations. According to 15N labeling experiments carried out in 1997, ammonium is biologically oxidized by hydroxylamine, most likely derived from nitrite, as the probable electron acceptor. The conversion of hydrazine to dinitrogen gas is hypothesized to be the reaction that generates the electron equivalents for the reduction of nitrite to hydroxylamine.Ni, S-Q. and Zhang, J. Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation: From Laboratory to Full-Scale Application\\" BioMed Research International 2013; 2013, 1-10 In general, two possible reaction mechanisms are addressed: * One mechanism hypothesizes that a membrane-bound enzyme complex converts ammonium and hydroxylamine to hydrazine first, followed by the oxidation of hydrazine to dinitrogen gas in the periplasm. At the same time, nitrite is reduced to hydroxylamine at the cytoplasmic site of the same enzyme complex responsible for hydrazine oxidation with an internal electron transport (Figure 3a). * The other mechanism postulates the following: ammonium and hydroxylamine are converted to hydrazine by a membrane-bound enzyme complex, hydrazine is oxidized in the periplasm to dinitrogen gas, and the generated electrons are transferred via an electron transport chain to nitrite reducing enzyme in the cytoplasm where nitrite is reduced to hydroxylamine (Figure 3b). Whether the reduction of nitrite and the oxidation of hydrazine occur at different sites of the same enzyme or the reactions are catalyzed by different enzyme systems connected via an electron transport chain remains to be investigated. In microbial nitrogen metabolism, the occurrence of hydrazine as an intermediate is rare. Hydrazine has been proposed as an enzyme-bound intermediate in the nitrogenase reaction. Recently, using detailed molecular analyses and combining complementary methods, Kartal and coworkers published strong evidence supporting the latter mechanism. Furthermore, the enzyme producing hydrazine, hydrazine synthase was purified and shown to produce hydrazine from NO and ammonium. The production of hydrazine from ammonium and NO was also supported by the resolution of the crystal structure of the enzyme hydrazine sythase. A possible role of nitric oxide (NO) or nitroxyl (HNO) in anammox was proposed by Hooper et al. by way of condensation of NO or HNO and ammonium on an enzyme related to the ammonium monooxygenase family. The formed hydrazine or imine could subsequently be converted by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidase to dinitrogen gas, and the reducing equivalents produced in the reaction are required to combine NO or HNO and ammonium or to reduce nitrite to NO. Environmental genomics analysis of the species Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, through a slightly different and complementary metabolism mechanism, suggested NO to be the intermediate instead of hydroxylamine (Figure 4). However, this hypothesis also agreed that hydrazine was an important intermediate in the process. In this pathway (Figure 4), there are two enzymes unique to anammox bacteria: hydrazine synthase (hzs) and hydrazine dehydrogenase (hdh). The HZS produces hydrazine from nitric oxide and ammonium, and HDH transfer the electrons from hydrazine to ferredoxin. Few new genes, such as some known fatty acid biosynthesis and S-adenosylmethionine radical enzyme genes, containing domains involved in electron transfer and catalysis have been detected. Anammox microorganisms can also directly couple NO reduction to ammonia oxidation, without the need for nitrite supply. Another, still unexplored, reaction mechanism involves anaerobic ammonium oxidation on anodes of bio-electrical systems. Such systems can be microbial fuel cells or microbial electrolysis cells. In the absence of dissolved oxygen, nitrite, or nitrate, microbes living in the anode compartment are able to oxidize ammonium to dinitrogen gas (N2) just as in the classical anammox process. At the same time, they unload the liberated electrons onto the anode, producing electrical current. This electrical current can be used either directly in fuel cell mode or for hydrogen and methane gas production in electrolysis mode. While there is no clarity on the reaction mechanism behind, one hypothesis is that nitrite, nitrate, or dinitrogen oxide play a role as intermediates. However, since the process occurs at very low electrochemical potentials, other, more speculative, reaction mechanisms seem possible as well. Species diversity Until now, ten anammox species have been described, including seven that are available in laboratory enrichment cultures. All have the taxonomical status of Candidatus, as none were obtained as classical pure cultures. Known species are divided over five genera: # Kuenenia, one species: Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. # Brocadia, three species: B. anammoxidans, B. fulgida, and B. sinica. # Anammoxoglobus, one species: A. propionicus. # Jettenia, one species: J. asiatica. # Scalindua, four species: S. brodae, S. sorokinii, S. wagneri, and S. profunda. Representatives of the first four genera were enriched from sludge from wastewater treatment plants; K. stuttgartiensis, B. anammoxidans, B. fulgida, and A. propionicus were even obtained from the same inoculum. Scalindua dominates the marine environment, but is also found in some freshwater ecosystems and wastewater treatment plants. Together, these 10 species likely only represent a minute fraction of anammox biodiversity. For instance, there are currently over 2000 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with anammox bacteria that have been deposited to the Genbank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), representing an overlooked continuum of species, subspecies, and strains, each apparently having found its specific niche in the wide variety of habitats where anammox bacteria are encountered. Species microdiversity is particularly impressive for the marine representative Scalindua.Schmid, M. C. et al. Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria in marine environments: widespread occurrence but low diversity (2007) A question that remains to be investigated is which environmental factors determine species differentiation among anammox bacteria. The sequence identities of the anammox 16S rRNA genes range from 87 to 99%, and phylogenetic analysis places them all within the phylum Planctomycetes, which form the PVC superphylum together with Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae. Within the Planctomycetes, anammox bacteria deeply branch as a monophyletic clade. Their phylogenetic position together with a broad range of specific physiological, cellular, and molecular traits give anammox bacteria their own order Brocadiales.Jetten MSM, Op den Camp HJM, Kuenen JG & Strous M (2010) Description of the order Brocadiales. Bergey‚Äôs Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Vol 4 (Krieg NR, Ludwig W, Whitman WB, Hedlund BP, Paster BJ, Staley JT, Ward N, Brown D & Parte A, eds), pp. 596‚Äì603. Springer, Heidelberg Application in wastewater treatment The application of the anammox process lies in the removal of ammonium in wastewater treatment and consists of two separate processes. The first step is partial nitrification (nitritation) of half of the ammonium to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria: :2NH4+ \\\\+ 3O2 -> 2NO2‚àí \\\\+ 4H+ \\\\+ 2H2O The resulting ammonium and nitrite are converted in the anammox process to dinitrogen gas and circa 15% nitrate (not shown) by anammox bacteria: :NH4+ \\\\+ NO2‚àí -> N2 \\\\+ 2 H2O Both processes can take place in 1 reactor where two guilds of bacteria form compact granules. For the enrichment of the anammox organisms a granular biomass or biofilm system seems to be especially suited in which the necessary sludge age of more than 20 days can be ensured. Possible reactors are sequencing batch reactors (SBR), moving bed reactors or gas-lift-loop reactors. The cost reduction compared to conventional nitrogen removal is considerable; the technique is still young but proven in several fullscale installations. The first full scale reactor intended for the application of anammox bacteria was built in the Netherlands in 2002. In other wastewater treatment plants, such as the one in Germany (Hattingen), anammox activity is coincidentally observed though were not built for that purpose. As of 2006, there are three full scale processes in The Netherlands: one in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (in Rotterdam), and two on industrial effluent. One is a tannery, the other a potato processing plant. Advantages Conventional nitrogen removal from ammonium-rich wastewater is accomplished in two separate steps: nitrification, which is mediated by aerobic ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and denitrification carried out by denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate to N2 with the input of suitable electron donors. Aeration and input of organic substrates (typically methanol) show that these two processes are: # Highly energy consuming. # Associated with the production of excess sludge. # Produce significant amounts of green-house gases such as CO2 and N2O and ozone- depleting NO. Because anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite directly to N2 anaerobically, this process does not require aeration and other electron donors. Nevertheless, oxygen is still required for the production of nitrite by ammonia-oxiding bacteria. However, in partial nitritation/anammox systems, oxygen demand is greatly reduced because only half of the ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite instead of full conversion to nitrate. The autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria guarantee a low yield and thus less sludge production. Additionally, anammox bacteria easily form stable self-aggregated biofilm (granules) allowing reliable operation of compact systems characterized by high biomass concentration and conversion rate up to 5‚Äì10 kg N m‚àí3.van Loosdrecht MCM (2008) Innovative nitrogen removal. In: Henze M, van Loosdrecht MCM, Ekama GA, Brdjanovic D (eds) Biological wastewater treatment: principles, modelling and design. IWA Publishing, London, pp 139‚Äì155 Overall, it has been shown that efficient application of the anammox process in wastewater treatment results in a cost reduction of up to 60% as well as lower CO2 emissions. Disadvantages The doubling time is slow, between 10 days to 2 weeks.microbewiki: Anammox This makes it difficult to grow enough sludge for a wastewater treatment reactor. Also the recovery time after the loss of sludge by accident is longer than in conventional nitrogen removal systems. On the other hand, this slow growing rate is an advantage due to the reduction of surplus sludge that needs to be removed and treated. Depending on the exact species, the optimum pH level is 8. Therefore, it can be necessary to adjust the pH of the wastewater by adding caustic.

Plot summary An American couple, The Forrests, want to introduce a visiting English friend to an authentic American billionaire. They take him to a dinner party where he meets a Texan businessman, John Born. The Forrests and their friend, Donald King, and Mr. Born discuss the recent re- election of President Dwight David Eisenhower and a gas bill that the President vetoed earlier in the year. The history that provoked Updike to write a story about such a conversation has been largely forgotten in the intervening half century, but at that time he was able to assume most of his readers would know that on February 6, 1956, Senator Francis Case of South Dakota had said on the U.S. Senate floor that a lobbyist for a natural gas company had left $2500 in cash in an envelope waiting for him, presumably in exchange for his vote on the deregulatory bill. This set off an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and forced creation of a select Senate committee to look into lobbying practices. The deregulation bill passed anyway, although President Eisenhower vetoed it on February 17. In the fictional discussion of these events, as Updike portrays it, Mr. Born claims that he is in possession of a trillion feet of natural gas that he has no incentive to sell unless some similar bill is passed in the next session of Congress and signed. On their way home, the Forrests and Mr. King are a bit confused. They wonder how many zeros are in a trillion -- American and UK conventions on that differed -- and whether he meant a trillion feet (305 million km) spread out along a pipeline or a trillion cubic feet (28 km¬≥).

Construction and commissioning Originally to be named Acoupa, hull SS-310 was renamed Batfish on 24 September 1942 prior to its keel laying on 27 December 1942. The Batfish was constructed at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Kittery, Maine and launched 5 May 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Nellie W. Fortier; and commissioned 21 August 1943, with Lieutenant Commander Wayne R. Merrill in command. Service history 1943-1945 Batfishs war operations spanned a period from 11 December 1943 to 26 August 1945 during which she completed seven war patrols. She is credited with having sunk nine Japanese ships totaling 10,658 tons while operating east of Japan, in the Philippine Sea, Luzon Strait, and South China Sea. Batfish received the Presidential Unit Citation for her sixth war patrol in the South China Sea during which she sank the three Japanese submarines. She was also awarded six battle stars for her World War II service. Combatant vessels sunk were: minesweeper No. 22 on 23 August 1944 at ; the destroyer Samidare, 26 August 1944 at ; most likely the Japanese submarine RO-115 Which sub was it? http://www.ussbatfish.com/whichsub.html (since there were several possible IJN subs missing in approximately the same time period and region, along with conflicting claims of sinking by other US surface warships and aircraft) on 10 February 1945 at ; Japanese submarine RO-112 on 11 February 1945 at ; and Japanese submarine RO-113 on 13 February 1945 at . The Japanese submarines were equipped with radar, which, while helping them locate enemy targets, also made them vulnerable to attack. The Batfish was able to locate them by searching for their radar emissions. 1946-1952 Batfish arrived in San Francisco on 9 September 1945 after the Japanese surrender. After arriving in San Francisco, Batfish was sent to Mare Island Navy Yard for inactive overhaul to prepare the boat for her peacetime service. Following completion of her pre-inactivation overhaul, Batfish was decommissioned on 6 April 1946 and laid up as a training vessel in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. 1952-1969 As the Korean War gained intensity, Batfish received her reactivation overhaul in January 1952 and was recommissioned on 7 March 1952 with Lieutenant Commander Robert J. Jackson in command. She set course via the Panama Canal for Key West, Florida after six weeks of readiness training. She was assigned to Submarine Division 122, U.S. Atlantic Fleet on 21 April. Batfish served the remainder of her commissioned career in training operations in the Caribbean and along the eastern seaboard. She was deactivated for the last time 5 May 1957 at the Charleston Naval Shipyard she was later decommissioned on 4 August 1958 and assigned to the Charleston Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. During the summer of 1959, Batfish was assigned as a naval reserve training vessel in New Orleans, and on 1 July 1960, she was redesignated as an Auxiliary Research Submarine (AGSS-310) on 1 July 1960. She continued to serve at New Orleans until she was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 November 1969 after 26 years of Service. Museum ship Procurement Starting in 1969, Oklahoma Submarine veterans were impressed by the museum in Mobile, Alabama, which drew over 300,000 paying visitors its first year. A delegation from the Oklahoma City and Tulsa chapters asked the U.S. Navy if they could adopt a retired submarine. On hand at the time in the New Orleans Naval Yard was , which the Navy agreed to turn over to them if they could fulfill the donation requirements. Wanting Piranha for his hometown, then State Senator James Inhofe agreed to sponsor a bill accepting the submarine for Oklahoma. An initial report claimed that it was impossible to get a submarine as far upriver as Tulsa, due to the Arkansas River Channel not being deep enough above Muskogee, Oklahoma. Later, a direct tow to Muskogee was determined to also not be possible, therefore another method of transport other than direct towing would have to be devised. The Muskogee City-County Trust Port Authority in the meantime donated five acres of prime waterfront real estate for the submarine's berth and memorial park. The procurement committee met with the Navy for preliminary arrangements for the transfer of Piranha, however the Navy would not hold the submarine unless the committee made a formal application for her with possession being immediate once the donation contract was approved. Since the Arkansas River Navigable Waterway system would not be open for at least a year, interim docking charges would be incurred. The procurement committee decided to wait and take their chances on another submarine being made available. In September 1970, the procurement committee inspected Batfish as a possible alternative to Piranha, both of which were mothballed at the Naval Inactive Ship Facility in Orange, Texas. Both submarines had suffered considerable neglect, with Piranha being almost completely cannibalized for parts, whereas Batfish was much cleaner and better outfitted. Batfishs better war record compared to Piranha impressed the committee; in 1971, a formal application to acquire Batfish was made. The Navy made no objection to the last-minute swap, and the donation contract was drawn up on 24 June 1971. John H. Chafee, the Secretary of the Navy, approved the transaction and congressional approval was obtained on 8 November 1971. Towing and permanent placement USS Batfish (SS-310) in 2017 On 9 December 1971, ownership of the boat was transferred to the Oklahoma Maritime Advisory Board. The towing was divided into two phases. Phase one was a direct offshore tow from Orange to the Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans. At the shipyard, Batfish would be raised on steel lifting straps and cradled between two pairs of bare-decked barges, so the submarine's draft would be high enough to make phase two of the tow, upriver, possible. Strike action at the Orange drydock caused the submarine to instead be towed to the Bethlehem Steel drydock in Beaumont, Texas. After a general inspection and clearing of fuel and ballast tanks, Batfish was sealed up and was ready to tow to Avondale on 1 March 1972. At Avondale, it was found that the four barges were insufficient to reduce the submarine's draft, and a new plan for six barges, ballasted to the outside and linked together by steel cables. On 13 March, Batfish was partially secured to the barges by lifting straps, but no cables had been placed to bind them together. That afternoon, the English tanker Silverman passed through a nearby zone at : the resulting wake sank one barge and seriously damaged several others, although Batfish herself escaped major harm. Torpedo room The flotilla of barges was re-assembled, and Batfish was slowly moved up-river by two tugs at . On 3 May 1972 she passed with ease through Lock-and-Dam Number 6, but her superstructure had trouble clearing a bridge on the way into Little Rock, Arkansas, and was only able to pass under when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lowered the river level by . One tug returned downriver, and the second tug continued the tow towards Fort Smith. Batfish arrived at the Will Brothers Port of Muskogee Terminal on 7 May 1972: this was her temporary home until a wide, trench could be dug to the boat's permanent berthing site. On 4 July 1972, while still at Muskogee Terminal, Batfish was unofficially opened to the public. Heavy spring rains flooded the Arkansas River on 12 March 1973, which caused Batfish to strain at her moorings, with fears that she would rip loose and damage the surrounding docks or collide with the new U.S. Route 62 bridge downriver and block the channel. Although the submarine remained moored, the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Commission wanted to return the submarine to the Navy. However, the Navy expected Oklahoma to honor its contract. On 4 April 1973, the trench to the new slipway was completed, and Batfish was maneuvered into position by cables attached to four bulldozers, plus a Port of Muskogee tugboat. Over the next week, further flooding of the slip was used to bring the submarine to her final resting elevation, and by 1 May, she had been realigned to overlook the Arkansas River at what is now Muskogee War Memorial Park: Home of the USS Batfish. Batfish was officially opened on the Memorial Day weekend; by the end of August 1973, the submarine was attracting a thousand visitors a week, with income from paid attendance doubling over the boat's first seven weeks on display. The submarine had been restored well, with the exception of the conning tower, and she is open to the public year round. The submarine suffered $150,000 in damage during the May 2019 floods. While the park and grounds are open for visitors, the submarine remains closed due to the flood damage while funds are raised for repairs. On November 19th, 2019 World of Warships publisher Wargaming announced that they would be holding a fundraiser for the submarine. Beginning that day players could contribute to the game's \\"Save the Batfish\\" campaign. For $10 players would receive in-game items including a patch that was similar to the one worn by sailors on the boat during their service. 100% of the campaign's proceeds went towards the \\"Save the Batfish\\" fund.

Bell Gothic is a sans-serif typeface in the industrial or grotesque style designed by Chauncey H. Griffith in 1938 while heading the typographic development program at the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. The typeface was commissioned by AT&T; as a proprietary typeface for use in telephone directories and has since been made available for general licensing. Bell Gothic is designed for maximum legibility in the adverse conditions of small print on poor-quality newsprint paper, into which ink tends to absorb and spread out. It is therefore a popular font in printing at small sizes. Bell Gothic was replaced by AT&T; with Matthew Carter's typeface Bell Centennial in 1978, the one hundredth anniversary of AT&T;'s founding. Similar to the Monotype Grotesque.  Design  Earlier in Griffith's career at Mergenthaler Linotype, he had developed a highly successful newspaper text face called Excelsior, which overcame many of the limitations of printing smaller point sizes on low quality newsprint. This contributed to his addressing similar limitations of telephone book printing. Bell Gothic was designed to be highly legible at small sizes, economical in its use of space (and hence paper), and reproduce well on uncoated, absorbent paper newsprint stock under less than optimal conditions. Griffith's face Bell Gothic is distinct for the cross bars on the uppercase I, the foot and cross bar on figure 1, and the angled terminus of the stroke on characters b, d, h, k, l, n, p, and q. While there are suggestions of an ink trap in several characters, they are minimal in comparison to the exaggerated ones found in Bell Centennial.  Evolution of use  Bell Gothic remained in uninterrupted use for AT&T; telephone directories for forty years. Following AT&T;'s adoption of Bell Centennial, the Mergenthaler Linotype foundry licensed Bell Gothic for general use. Beginning in the early 1990s Bell Gothic became popular and associated with avant garde experimentation with type at places like the Cranbrook Academy of Art the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands, and RISD. The typeface was used as a display and caption face by Metropolis magazine, by Canadian graphic designer Bruce Mau in designing the initial ZONE book series, Dutch graphic designer Irma Boom, and has been widely used by Semiotext(e) Books, the MIT Press, and Dia Art Foundation.  Revisions  Along with Matthew Carter's 1978 Bell Centennial reworking, Tobias Frere-Jones designed the Griffith Gothic typeface family for the Font Bureau in 1997. Condensed and italic variants were added, thus expanding the family in 2000. Isabella Ch√¶va produced a cyrillic version of Bell Gothic for ParaType, based in Moscow, Russia, in 1999.

History Sports Illustrated for Women, renamed Sports Illustrated Women (SI Women) in 2001, launched under the leadership of Cleary Simpson, Group Publisher and Sandy Bailey, Editor in Chief. SI Women initially ran test publications as Sports Illustrated Women/Sport, in 1997. The test magazine was published in two issues, followed by four special issues in 1999, under the title Sports Illustrated Women. The March 2000 launch of the ongoing product, slated for six issues per year, included a website, siforwomen.com. Circulation base rate was estimated at 300,000. By 2002 it had reached 400,000. Its newsstand price was $3.50. Publishers Information Bureau statistics showed that SI Womens ad pages jumped 26.51 percent from 2000 to 2001 and its revenues increased 73.28 percent, from $5,499,509 to $9,529,281. The magazine went through a makeover and name change (to SI Women) in September 2001, after Susan Casey, former Editor of Outside, took over from Sandy Bailey, as Editor in Chief. Research showed that, \\"women are more interested in sports as participants than fans, unlike men.\\" That year, the magazine expanded, planning 10 issues per year and revamping its content to, \\"a wider range of activities pursued by today's modern, active women,\\" including participatory sports with sections on training and adventure travel. In 2002, SI Women received a nomination for General Excellence from the National Magazine Awards. Last issue On 14 October 2002, SI Women announced that December 2002 would be its last issue. President Ann S. Moore cited the downturn in the ad economy, stating, \\"SI Women needed a significant investment to reach its potential\\", and, \\"The investment climate was simply not on our side.\\" Controversy Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition was created with the intentions of celebrating women and exposing their beauty, however it has caused uproar within the media lately. In a study done by the Department of Sociology at the University of Louisville, it was found that out of the 716 regular Sports Illustrated magazines published between 2000 and 2011, only 35 of the covers featured female athletes. These surprising numbers have gotten increasingly worse considering between 1954 and 1965 women were given about 12.6% of cover images, according to the study. According to Walter Bingham, SI writer and editor, many people want to do away with the swimsuit edition but it is their biggest money maker so they never could. About the evolution of the magazine, \\"the suits got skimpier and skimpier, the models' attributes bigger and bigger,\\" Bingham wrote in 2010 in the Cape Cod Times.

On 2 December 1942, the first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1, during an experiment led by Enrico Fermi. The secret development of the reactor was the first major technical achievement for the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. Although the project's civilian and military leaders had misgivings about the possibility of a disastrous runaway reaction, they trusted Fermi's safety calculations and decided they could carry out the experiment in a densely populated area. It was built by the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. Fermi described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\". The reactor was assembled in November 1942, by a team that included Fermi, Leo Szilard (who had previously formulated an idea for non-fission chain reaction), Leona Woods, Herbert L. Anderson, Walter Zinn, Martin D. Whitaker, and George Weil. The reactor used natural uranium. This required a very large amount of material in order to reach criticality, along with graphite used as a neutron moderator. The reactor contained 45,000 ultra-pure graphite blocks weighing , and was fueled by of uranium metal and of uranium oxide. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it operated at very low power‚Äîabout one-half watt. The pursuit for a reactor had been touched off by concern that Nazi Germany had a substantial scientific lead. The success of Chicago Pile-1 provided the first vivid demonstration of the feasibility of the military use of nuclear energy by the Allies, and the reality of the danger that Nazi Germany could succeed in producing nuclear weapons. Previously, estimates of critical masses had been crude calculations, leading to order-of-magnitude uncertainties about the size of a hypothetical bomb. The successful use of graphite as a moderator paved the way for progress in the Allied effort, whereas the German program languished partly because of the belief that scarce and expensive heavy water would have to be used for that purpose. In 1943, CP-1 was moved to Red Gate Woods, and reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). There, it was operated for research until 1954, when it was dismantled and buried. The stands at Stagg Field were demolished in August 1957; the site is now a National Historic Landmark and a Chicago Landmark. Origins The idea of chemical chain reactions was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for a situation in which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, and also entertained the possibility of using uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by their collaborators Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or indium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful. In order for a chain reaction to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Italian physicist, Enrico Fermi, with Americans John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission from the head of the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium- beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi urged Alfred O. C. Nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and, on 29 February 1940, Nier separated the first uranium-235 sample, which, after being mailed to Dunning at Columbia, was confirmed to be the isolated fissile material. When he was working in Rome, Fermi had discovered that collisions between neutrons and neutron moderators can slow the neutrons down, and thereby make them more likely to be captured by uranium nuclei, causing the uranium to fission. Szilard suggested to Fermi that they use carbon in the form of graphite as a moderator. As a back-up plan, he considered heavy water. This contained deuterium, which would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, and was a better neutron moderator than carbon; but heavy water was expensive and difficult to produce, and several tons of it might be needed. Fermi estimated that a fissioning uranium nucleus produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. (Today the average number of neutrons emitted per fissioning uranium-235 nucleus is known to be about 2.4). Szilard estimated he would need about of graphite and of uranium. In December 1940, Fermi and Szilard met with Herbert G. MacPherson and Victor C. Hamister at National Carbon to discuss the possible existence of impurities in graphite, and the procurement of graphite of a purity that had never been produced commercially. National Carbon, a chemical company, had taken the then unusual step of hiring MacPherson, a physicist, to research carbon arc lamps, a major commercial use for graphite at that time. Because of his work studying the spectroscopy of the carbon arc, MacPherson knew that the major relevant contaminant was boron, both because of its concentration and its affinity for absorbing neutrons, confirming a suspicion of Szilard's. More importantly, MacPherson and Hamister believed that techniques for producing graphite of a sufficient purity could be developed. Had Fermi and Szilard not consulted MacPherson and Hamister, they might have concluded, incorrectly, as the Germans did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator. Over the next two years, MacPherson, Hamister and Lauchlin M. Currie developed thermal purification techniques for the large scale production of low boron content graphite. The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite (\\"Acheson Graphite Ordinary Temperature\\") by National Carbon. With a neutron absorption cross section of 4.97 mbarns, the AGOT graphite is considered as the first true nuclear-grade graphite. By November 1942 National Carbon had shipped of AGOT graphite to the University of Chicago, where it became the primary source of graphite to be used in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Government support Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of a German nuclear weapon project, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his prestige to the proposal. The Einstein‚ÄìSzilard letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government. An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist and the director of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on 21 October 1939 was attended by Szilard, Teller and Wigner. The scientists persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments‚Äîin particular, more graphite. Pupin Hall at Columbia University In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) created a special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the University of Chicago, to report on the uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic mass numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be. In May 1941, Emilio Segr√® and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 Œºg of plutonium in the cyclotron there, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, and it was not possible to produce a sufficiently large quantity that way. Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible. The final draft of Compton's November 1941 report made no mention of plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945. Development On the fourth anniversary of the team's success, 2 December 1946, members of the CP-1 team gathered at the University of Chicago. Back row, from left: Norman Hilberry, Samuel Allison, Thomas Brill, Robert Nobles, Warren Nyer, and Marvin Wilkening. Middle row: Harold Agnew, William Sturm, Harold Lichtenberger, Leona Woods and Leo Szilard. Front row: Enrico Fermi, Walter Zinn, Albert Wattenberg and Herbert L. Anderson. In a nuclear reactor, criticality is achieved when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron losses, including both neutron absorption and neutron leakage. When a uranium-235 atom undergoes fission, it releases an average of 2.4 neutrons. In the simplest case of an unreflected, homogeneous, spherical reactor, the critical radius was calculated to be approximately: ,}} where M is the average distance that a neutron travels before it is absorbed, and k is the average neutron multiplication factor. The neutrons in succeeding reactions will be amplified by a factor k, the second generation of fission events will produce k2, the third k3 and so on. In order for a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction to occur, k must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1. In other words, k must be greater than 1 without crossing the prompt critical threshold that would result in a rapid, exponential increase in the number of fission events. Fermi christened his apparatus a \\"pile\\". Emilio Segr√® later recalled that: Another grant, this time of $40,000, was obtained from the S-1 Uranium Committee to purchase more materials, and in August 1941 Fermi began to plan the building of a sub-critical assembly to test with a smaller structure whether a larger one would work. The so-called exponential pile he proposed to build was long, wide and high. This was too large to fit in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: One of at least 29 experimental piles that were constructed in 1942 under the West Stands of Stagg Field. Each tested elements incorporated into the final design. The pile was built in September 1941 from graphite blocks and tinplate iron cans of uranium oxide. The cans were cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about . There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A radium- beryllium neutron source was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into the cans while still hot on a shaking table. The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's football team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing k of 0.87. Compton felt that having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project. Before leaving for Chicago, Fermi's team made one last attempt to build a working pile at Columbia. Since the cans had absorbed neutrons, they were dispensed with. Instead, the uranium oxide, heated to to dry it out, was pressed into cylindrical holes long and in diameter drilled into the graphite. The entire pile was then canned by soldering sheet metal around it, and the contents heated above the boiling point of water to remove moisture. The result was a k of 0.918. Choice of site Augustus Knuth joints a wooden block for the timber frame In Chicago, Samuel K. Allison had found a suitable location long, wide and high, sunk slightly below ground level, in a space under the stands at Stagg Field originally built as a rackets court. Stagg Field had been largely unused since the University of Chicago had given up playing American football in 1939, but the rackets courts under West Stands were still used for playing squash and handball. Leona Woods and Anthony L. Turkevich played squash there in 1940. Since it was intended for strenuous exercise, the area was unheated, and very cold in the winter. The nearby North Stands had a pair of ice skating rinks on the ground floor, which although they were unrefrigerated, seldom melted in winter. Allison used the rackets court area to construct a experimental pile before Fermi's group arrived in 1942. The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed control of the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory became part of what came to be called the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. became director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory for the first time on 5 October. Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands. Fermi designed a new pile, which would be spherical to maximize k, which was predicted to be around 1.04, thereby achieving criticality. Leona Woods was detailed to build boron trifluoride neutron detectors as soon as she completed her doctoral thesis. She also helped Anderson locate the required large number of timbers at lumber yards in Chicago's south side. Shipments of high-purity graphite arrived, mainly from National Carbon, and high-purity uranium dioxide from Mallinckrodt in St Louis, which was now producing a month. Metallic uranium also began arriving in larger quantities, the product of newly developed techniques. On 25 June, the Army and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) had selected a site in the Argonne Forest near Chicago for a plutonium pilot plant. This became known as Site A. were leased from Cook County in August, but by September it was apparent that the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere. The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile‚Äîa fully functional nuclear reactor‚Äîat a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field. CP-1 under construction: 4th layer The risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux. Fermi argued that by using the delayed neutrons, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field. Compton later explained that: Compton informed Groves of his decision at the 14 November meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee. Although Groves \\"had serious misgivings about the wisdom of Compton's suggestion\\", he did not interfere. James B. Conant, the chairman of the NDRC, was reported to have turned white. But because of the urgency and their confidence in Fermi's calculations, no one objected. Construction CP-1 under construction: 7th layer Chicago Pile 1 was encased within a balloon so that the air inside could be replaced by carbon dioxide. Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. A cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project's AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with no questions asked. A block and tackle was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began on the morning of 16 November 1942. The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite. Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power. The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. For a work force they hired thirty high school dropouts that were eager to earn a bit of money before being drafted into the Army. They machined 45,000 graphite blocks enclosing 19,000 pieces of uranium metal and uranium oxide. The graphite arrived from the manufacturers in bars of various lengths. They were cut into standard lengths of , each weighing . A lathe was used to drill holes in the blocks for the control rods and the uranium. A hydraulic press was used to shape the uranium oxide into \\"pseudospheres\\", cylinders with rounded ends. Drill bits had to be sharpened after each 60 holes, which worked out to be about once an hour. Graphite dust soon filled the air and made the floor slippery. Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was responsible for instrumentation. They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the scram line, a manila rope that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a variable resistor, controlling an electric motor that would spool the clothesline wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would fail- safe and return to its zero position when released. CP-1 under construction: 10th layer About two layers were laid per shift. Woods' boron trifluoride neutron counter was inserted at the 15th layer. Thereafter, readings were taken at the end of each shift. Fermi divided the square of the radius of the pile by the intensity of the radioactivity to obtain a metric that counted down to one as the pile approached criticality. At the 15th layer, it was 390; at the 19th it was 320; at the 25th it was 270 and by the 36th it was only 149. The original design was for a spherical pile, but as work proceeded, it became clear that this would not be necessary. The new graphite was purer, and of very pure metallic uranium began to arrive from the Ames Project at Iowa State University, where a team under Frank Spedding had developed a new process to produce uranium metal. Westinghouse Lamp Plant supplied , which it produced in a rush with a makeshift process. The metallic uranium cylinders, known as \\"Spedding's eggs\\", were dropped in the holes in the graphite in lieu of the uranium oxide pseudospheres. The process of filling the balloon with carbon dioxide would not be necessary, and twenty layers could be dispensed with. According to Fermi's new calculations, the countdown would reach 1 between the 56th and 57th layers. The resulting pile was therefore flatter on the top than on the bottom. Anderson called a halt after the 57th layer was placed. When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, high, wide at the ends and across the middle. It contained of uranium metal, of uranium oxide and of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million. First nuclear chain reaction The Chianti fiasco purchased by Eugene Wigner to help celebrate the first self-sustaining, controlled chain reaction. It was signed by the participants. The next day, 2 December 1942, everybody assembled for the experiment. There were 49 scientists present. Although most of the S-1 Executive Committee was in Chicago, only Crawford Greenewalt was present, at Compton's invitation. Other dignitaries present included Szilard, Wigner and Spedding. Fermi, Compton, Anderson and Zinn gathered around the controls on the balcony, which was originally intended as a viewing platform. Samuel Allison stood ready with a bucket of concentrated cadmium nitrate, which he was to throw over the pile in the event of an emergency. The startup began at 09:54. Walter Zinn removed the zip, the emergency control rod, and secured it. Norman Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, which would allow the zip to fall under the influence of gravity. While Leona Woods called out the count from the boron trifluoride detector in a loud voice, George Weil, the only one on the floor, withdrew all but one of the control rods. At 10:37 Fermi ordered Weil to remove all but of the last control rod. Weil withdrew it at a time, with measurements being taken at each step. The process was abruptly halted by the automatic control rod reinserting itself, due to its trip level being set too low. At 11:25, Fermi ordered the control rods reinserted. He then announced that it was lunch time. The experiment resumed at 14:00. Weil worked the final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi announced that the pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups. Compton notified Conant by telephone. The conversation was in an impromptu code: Later operation On 12 December 1942 CP-1's power output was increased to 200 W, enough to power a light bulb. Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity, and further testing was continued at 0.5 W. Operation was terminated on 28 February 1943, and the pile was dismantled and moved to Site A in the Argonne Forest, now known as Red Gate Woods. There the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about tall with a base approximately square. It was surrounded by concrete walls thick that acted as a radiation shielding, with overhead protection from of lead and of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained of uranium and of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943, with a k of 1.055. During the war Zinn allowed CP-2 to be run around the clock, and its design was suitable for conducting experiments. CP-2 was joined by Chicago Pile-3, the first heavy water reactor, which went critical on 15 May 1944. Commemorative boulder at Site A The reactors were used to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross- section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 over the course of a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals. Though held secret for a decade, Szilard and Fermi jointly patented the design, with an initial filing date of 19 Dec. 1944 as the neutronic reactor no. 2,708,656. The Red Gate Woods later became the original site of Argonne National Laboratory, which replaced the Metallurgical Laboratory on 1 July 1946, with Zinn as its first director. CP-2 and CP-3 operated for ten years before they outlived their usefulness, and Zinn ordered them shut down on 15 May 1954. Their remaining usable fuel was transferred to Chicago Pile-5 at the Argonne National Laboratory's new site in DuPage County, and the CP-2 and CP-3 reactors were dismantled in 1955 and 1956. Some of the graphite blocks from CP-1/CP-2 were reused in the reflector of the TREAT reactor. High-level nuclear waste such as fuel and heavy water were shipped to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for disposal. The rest was encased in concrete and buried in a trench in what is now known as the Site A/Plot M Disposal Site. It is marked by a commemorative boulder. the site memorial. By the 1970s there was increased public concern about the levels of radioactivity at the site, which was used by the local residents for recreational purposes. Surveys conducted in the 1980s found strontium-90 in the soil at Plot M, trace amounts of tritium in nearby wells, and plutonium, technetium, caesium, and uranium in the area. In 1994, the United States Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory yielded to public pressure and earmarked $24.7 million and $3.4 million respectively to rehabilitate the site. As part of the cleanup, of radioactive waste was removed and sent to the Hanford Site for disposal. By 2002, the Illinois Department of Public Health had determined that the remaining materials posed no danger to public health. Significance and commemoration The successful test of CP-1 not only proved that a nuclear reactor was feasible, it demonstrated that the k factor was larger than originally thought. This removed the objections to the use of air or water as a coolant rather than expensive helium. It also meant that there was greater latitude in the choice of materials for coolant pipes and control mechanisms. Wigner now pressed ahead with his design for a water-cooled production reactor. There remained concerns about the ability of a graphite-moderated reactor being able to produce plutonium on industrial scale, and for this reason the Manhattan Project continued the development of heavy water production facilities. An air-cooled reactor, the X-10 Graphite Reactor, was built at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge as part of a plutonium semiworks, followed by larger water-cooled production reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington state. Enough plutonium was produced for an atomic bomb by July 1945, and for two more in August. A commemorative plaque was unveiled at Stagg Field on 2 December 1952, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of CP-1 going critical. It read: The plaque was saved when the West Stands were demolished in August 1957. The site of CP-1 was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 18 February 1965. When the National Register of Historic Places was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well. The site was also named a Chicago Landmark on 27 October 1971. Today the site of the old Stagg Field is occupied by the University's Regenstein Library, which was opened in 1970, and the Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which was opened in 2011. A Henry Moore sculpture, Nuclear Energy, stands in a small quadrangle just outside the Regenstein Library. It was dedicated on 2 December 1967, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of CP-1 going critical. The commemorative plaques from 1952, 1965 and 1967 are nearby. A graphite block from CP-1 can be seen at the Bradbury Science Museum in Los Alamos, New Mexico; another is on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. On 2 December 2017, the 75th anniversary, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in restoring a research-graphite pile, similar in design to Chicago Pile-1, ceremonially inserted the final uranium slugs.

It is the only species of the monotypic genus Otidiphaps. The pheasant pigeon is found in the primary rainforests of New Guinea and nearby islands. It ranges primarily over hilly and lower mountain areas, but can also be found in lowlands. Taxonomy and systematics The genus name makes reference to its similarities to the bustard family (Otidae). Its common name reflects its adaptation to living on the forest floor in the fashion of a South East Asian pheasant. Subspecies Commonly, there are four subspecies recognized that differ primarily in the presence or absence of a small crest and in the colour of the nape: * White-naped pheasant pigeon (O. n. aruensis) ‚Äì Rothschild, 1928: Found on the Aru Islands, VulnerableBirdLife International. 2016.

Description The pheasant pigeon resembles a pheasant in external morphology, particularly in its laterally compressed tail and the rounded wings. They have glossy black heads, undersides, rears and lower backs, and short rounded brown wings, and a white, green, grey, or black nape depending on the subspecies. No galliform birds occur in New Guinea, and the pheasant pigeon has filled the ecological niche of a partridge or small pheasant (while the larger Goura crowned pigeons have a lifestyle similar to larger pheasants, grouse or turkeys). It is a highly secretive species, feeding on seeds and fallen fruits. It nests on the ground below trees and bushes, laying one egg that it incubates for around four weeks. Both adults incubate and look after the young, feeding regurgitated crop milk to their young (a common practice for most pigeons). They have a range of calls including a drilling- like sound, a typical pigeon cooing call and a loud \\"wu- huwoooooa\\" call which rises and falls in pitch before trailing off at the end. They are found in rainforest habitats, eating fallen fruits and seeds, in the Aru Islands. As they avoid human settlements, the little that is known about their behavior comes from observation at zoos. pheasant pigeon arp.jpg|O. n. nobilis Pheasant Pigeon RWD.jpg|O. n. nobilis in a zoo OtidiphapsInsularisKeulemans.jpg|O. n. insularis Otidiphaps nobilis.jpg|Captive O. n. aruensis (vulnerable) Status and conservation The green-naped pheasant pigeon (nominate subspecies) and the grey-naped pheasant pigeon are not considered threatened, although the black-naped pheasant pigeon is considered endangered and the white-naped pheasant pigeon is vulnerable. It is believed that the species is undergoing slow declines due to the deforestation of their habitats due to pressure for logging and agricultural space. Because it is tied to primary forests, and is unique within the pigeon family, it is considered a genus that requires further investigation and monitoring.

The ship, along with later sister ships and , was at the time the largest all welded passenger/cargo ship. The ships, of and varying only in interior decorations, were designed for New York to South and East African service with accommodations for 116 passengers. African Comet, ordered as American Banker, was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 106) on 1 July 1940 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. Launched on 28 June 1941, sponsored by Miss Mary Maud Farrell, and delivered 31 December 1941. The ship was acquired by the War Shipping Administration from the American South African Line, Inc., on 31 December 1941 and purchased by the Navy on 6 January 1942. The ship was renamed Arthur Middleton (AP-55) on 7 January 1942 for Arthur Middleton, a member of the Continental Congress. The ship underwent initial conversion at Tietjen & Lang Dry Dock Co. yard in Hoboken, N. J. for operation as a civilian-manned convoy-loaded transport.Photo data, US Navy Bureau of Ships photo 19-N-27271; USS Arthur Middleton (AP-55) departing New York, 18 January 1942, en route to the Pacific. dated 18 January 1942. She was fully converted for service as a combat-loaded (attack) transport by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California after arrival in San Francisco from the South Pacific in June 1942. Commissioned on 7 September 1942, Commander Paul K. Perry, USCG, in command. Service history USS Arthur Middleton (AP-55) departing New York, 18 January 1942, en route to the Pacific. After Navy acquisition and preliminary conversion, but before full conversion and commissioning, the Middleton was pressed into service during a shipping crisis involving securing the South Pacific lines of communication and critical air ferry route with Australia. New Caledonia (codename \\"Poppy\\"), a key point in those lines, had been in some turmoil with Vichy governance and recent takeover by Free French and was threatened by the Japanese. Another key island, Bora Bora (codename \\"Bobcat\\"), was also to be heavily reinforced in early 1942 yet available shipping was extremely short. Major realignment, taken to the head of state level, was required. The Bobcat convoy was to depart Charleston, South Carolina and, as a result of the candidate ship President Fillmore being damaged in a grounding with repairs taking longer than the convoy schedule allowed, the Arthur Middleton was quickly substituted and sent to Charleston from New York, but without proper ballasting for newly installed armament. Middleton turned out to be problematic with inadequate ballast for newly installed armament. She sailed for Charleston with a twelve degree list and then required work there. Work on Middleton and President Tyler, herself described as \\"a mess,\\" further delayed the convoy's departure from 15 January, already a delay from 8 January, to 25 January. A large convoy carrying elements of \\"Poppy Force\\" was to leave New York and, to conserve escorts, the Navy recommended combining the Poppy convoy with the Bobcat convoy and the Army agreed. Just as the Poppy convoy was due off Charleston the Navy found it could not make Middleton and another ship, the Hamul ready for sea until 27 January when Middleton was again delayed until mid afternoon. Middleton sailed for Australia and then to Bora Bora in Convoy BC.100 arriving Bora Bora on 17 February. The delay with ships and some cargo required that the convoy BT.200 bound for New Caledonia via Australia, carrying Poppy Force (designated Task Force 6814) that became the Americal Division, sailed separately a few days in advance of the Bora Bora force. USS Arthur Middleton (AP-55) approaching (upper right) grounded USS Worden (DD-352) with USS Dewey (DD-349) standing by. After full conversion to an attack transport in San Francisco the ship was manned by a combined Coast Guard and Navy crew. The transport held shakedown training off San Diego, California and sailed for the Aleutian Islands on 23 December. She reached Amchitka on 12 January 1943 and, later that day, took on board 175 survivors from Worden (DD-352), which had run aground and broken up while covering the transport during the debarkation of her troops. However, before the day ended, Arthur Middleton herself ran aground after dragging anchor. Salvage operations involved completely unloading, blasting and removing the rocks from under the ship's port side, and patching the holes which they had pierced in her hull. During this work, Arthur Middleton's boats operated in Amchitak harbor unloading supply ships and moving Army barges. On eight occasions, the grounded ship repulsed enemy float-plane attacks and was straddled by four bombs. While in Alaskan waters, Arthur Middleton was reclassified an attack transport and redesignated APA-25 on 1 February 1943. The ship was finally refloated and got underway on 9 April in tow of and for Dutch Harbor, Unalaska. There, work making temporary repairs continued through 17 June. She was then towed by the merchant ship and to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, for correction of the damage. Arthur Middleton departed Seattle, Washington, on 6 September, bound for New Zealand. She arrived at Wellington on 12 October, via Suva, Fiji Islands. The ship took on marines and cargo and sailed to Efate, New Hebrides, for staging operations. She then steamed to the Gilbert Islands for the landings on Tarawa on 20 November. The ship remained off that bitterly contested atoll debarking troops and taking casualties on board until the 29th, when she got underway for Hawaii. On 7 December, Arthur Middleton reached Pearl Harbor and began training operations. She sortied from Oahu on 23 January 1944 with Task Group (TG) 51.1, carrying marine reserves for the assault on the Marshall Islands. The transport remained in waters east of Kwajalein Atoll from 31 January through 15 February awaiting orders to disembark her troops; but, as part of the reserve force, they were not needed. During her time steaming off Kwajalein, she provided stores and fresh water to destroyers and smaller vessels, dispatched her boats on various assignments, and repaired damaged boats. She was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Parke Hughes who later became an eminent historian. On 15 February, Arthur Middleton sailed with the task group charged with invading Eniwetok. Arriving off that atoll on the 17th, Arthur Middleton landed assault troops on Engebi Island and unloaded her cargo as needed by forces ashore. Two days later, she took marines on board for an assault on Parry Island. The landing there took place on the 21st and 22d and, the next day, the ship sailed for Pearl Harbor with American casualties and Japanese prisoners of war embarked. She paused en route at Kwajalein on the 26th to embark more troops and then resumed her voyage to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 March. The attack transport held training exercises off Hawaii through late May. On the 30th, she sailed with TG 52.3 for the invasion of the Marianas. The ship arrived off Saipan on 15 June and debarked her passengers later that day at Charan Kanoa. She then began taking casualties on board while unloading her cargo. Although there were frequent air raid alerts during these operations, no Japanese planes came within range of the transport guns. She departed Saipan on 23 June, stopped at Eniwetok and Tarawa to pick up Army troops and Japanese prisoners, and continued on to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 9 July. After disembarking her passengers, she began the first of two voyages between San Diego and Hilo, Hawaii, carrying troops and equipment between the two points. At the end of these shuttle runs, the transport sailed for the Admiralty Islands. She arrived at Manus on 3 October and began preparations for the long-awaited operations to liberate the Philippine Islands. On 14 October, Arthur Middleton sortied with TG 79.2 and arrived in Leyte Gulf on the 20th. The ship remained in the area unloading troops until 24 October, when she headed for Hollandia, New Guinea. The attack transport returned to Leyte on 14 November, carrying personnel and supplies from Hollandia and Morotai, Netherlands East Indies. The next day, she sailed back to New Guinea and conducted training exercises in conjunction with Marine Corps units. On 31 December, the ship sailed with TG 79.4 for the invasion of Luzon and arrived in the transport area in the Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945 and landed her troops in the face of enemy air attack. During the operation, fifteen members of her crew were wounded by flying shrapnel from the guns of other vessels firing at the Japanese planes. The transport left Lingayen Gulf later that day to take on more supplies at Leyte and returned to Lingayen Gulf on 27 January. During February and early March, Arthur Middleton carried out training exercises at Guadalcanal. On 16 March, the transport sailed with TG 53.1 for Ulithi, where staging operations were held for the Ry≈´ky≈´ campaign. The ship discharged troops and cargo at Okinawa during the first five days of April and then returned via Saipan to Pearl Harbor. She was routed on to the west coast and arrived at San Pedro, Calif., on 30 April to begin a period of overhaul. While the ship was still in the yard, Japan surrendered on 14 August 1945. The repair work was completed on 4 September, and Arthur Middleton was assigned to duty transporting relief forces to the Philippines and returning veterans to the United States. By the end of 1945, the ship had made two voyages to the Philippines. In January 1946, she underwent repairs at Terminal Island, California. Following the detachment of her Coast Guard personnel, Arthur Middleton was transferred to the Naval Transportation Service on 1 February 1946. During the next four months, the transport made six round trips between San Francisco and Pearl Harbor. She then steamed through the Panama Canal and continued on to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 19 July 1946. The ship was placed out of commission at Norfolk on 21 October 1946 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. At the end of a dozen years in reserve, her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1958; and the ship was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the James River. She was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet on 3 March 1959. The vessel was sold for $96,666 on 9 May 1973 to the Consolidated Steel Corporation, Brownsville, Texas, and was later scrapped. Arthur Middleton won six battle stars for her World War II service. There was another ship with the name Arthur Middleton, a Liberty (EC2-S-C1) launched and delivered May‚ÄìJune 1942, operating at the same time as the USS Arthur Middleton until sunk by an explosion off Oran, North Africa 1 January 1943. As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named Arthur Middleton. Notes References References cited *APA-25 Arthur Middleton, Navsource Online.

It is also one of the top 50 electronic manufacturing services providers globally. Name and listing The company was originally named \\"Video Technology Limited\\" in reference to the company's first product, a home video game console. In 1991, it was renamed \\"VTech Holdings Limited\\" to reflect a wider portfolio of products. The company first listed in Hong Kong in June 1986 under the name \\"Video Technology International (Holdings) Limited\\". It was privatised and delisted from The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1990. VTech obtained a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. In 1992, the company relisted on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, establishing a dual primary listing with London. In 1993, the company established its American depositary receipt programme. VTech delisted voluntarily from the London Stock Exchange on 7 October 2008. It also terminated its American Depositary Receipt programme with effect from 21 January 2011. History Socrates. VTech was founded in Hong Kong in October 1976 by two local entrepreneurs, Allan Wong (Chi-Yun) and Stephen Leung. When the first single-chip microprocessor \\"Intel 4004\\" became available in the early 1970s, the company saw the potential it offered for portable consumer electronics products. Wong & Leung set up a small factory in To Kwa Wan, with a US$40,000 investment and a staff of 40 people. In the first year, turnover was less than US$1 million. VTech initially focused on developing video games. In 1977, the company created its first home TV game console, a version of Pong. Since only consumers in North America and Europe could afford such items, the company targeted primarily these markets. The United Kingdom was chosen as the first market for Pong, as Hong Kong and the UK used the same standard for television systems. In 1978, the founders introduced LED games they had developed to buyers from RadioShack in the US, which were sold under the RadioShack brand. VTech then began to build its own brand. Starting in the early 1980s, a line of electronic games would be manufactured. VTech unveiled its first electronic learning product, called \\"Lesson One\\", at the New York Toy Fair, in February 1980. It taught children basic spelling and maths. An exclusive version under the name \\"Computron\\" was offered to Sears, with the product being prominently advertised by Sears, in its catalogue, which was a popular shopping guide. Laser computer Next VTech made the video game console CreatiVision. An electronic product with an external projector from French company Ludotronic was adapted by VTech and sold as the \\"VTech ProScreen\\" in 1984, following the release of VTech's Gamate and Variety handheld products the year prior. VTech then branched out into personal computers, including a series of IBM compatible PCs beginning in 1983, followed by Apple II compatible computers, beginning in 1985, including a model called Laser 128. VTech exited the personal computer market in 1997, due to tight competition. In 1985, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated the frequency band 900MHz to ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) devices. Taking advantage of this, VTech began development on a cordless telephone, using the 900 MHz band, and in 1991 introduced the world's first fully digital 900 MHz cordless telephone. In 2000, to expand its cordless phone business, VTech acquired the consumer telephone business of Lucent Technologies. The acquisition also gave VTech the exclusive right for 10 years to use the AT&T; brand in conjunction with the manufacture and sale of wireline telephones and accessories in the United States and Canada. Although the acquisition increased sales of VTech's telecommunication products by 50%, it led to operating losses and write-offs. The company issued a profit warning in March 2001 and launched a broad restructuring plan. By the financial year 2002, the company had turned around the business and returned to profitability. Today, VTech's core businesses remain cordless telephones and electronic learning products. Its contract manufacturing services ‚Äì which manufactures various electronic products on behalf of medium-sized companies, has also become a major source of revenue. The company has diversified geographically, selling to North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.  2015 data breach  In November 2015, Lorenzo Bicchierai, writing for Vice magazine's Motherboard, reported that VTech's servers had been compromised and the corporation was victim to a data breach which exposed personal data belonging to 6.3 million individuals, including children, who signed up for or utilized services provided by the company related to several products it manufactures. Bicchierai was contacted by the unnamed attacker in late November, during the week before Thanksgiving, at which point the unnamed individual disclosed information about the security vulnerabilities with the journalist and detailed the breach. Bicchierai then reached out to information security researcher Troy Hunt to examine data provided by the attacker to Bicchierai, and to confirm if the leak was indeed authentic and not an internet hoax. Hunt examined the information and confirmed it appeared to be authentic. Hunt then dissected the data in detail and published the findings on his website. According to Hunt, VTech's servers failed to utilize basic SSL encryption to secure the personal data in transit from the devices to VTech's servers; that VTech stored customer information in unencrypted plaintext, failed to securely hash or salt passwords. The attack leveraged an SQL injection to gain privileged root access to VTech servers. Once privileged access was acquired, the attacker exfiltrated the data, including some 190 gigabytes of photographs of children and adults, detailed chat logs between parents and children which spanned over the course of years and voice recordings, all unencrypted and stored in plain text. The attacker shared some 3,832 image files with the journalist for verification purposes, and some redacted photographs were published by the journalist. Commenting on the leak, the unnamed attacker expressed their disgust with being able to so easily obtain access to such a large trove of data, saying: \\"Frankly, it makes me sick that I was able to get all this stuff. VTech should have the book thrown at them‚Äù and explained their rationale for going to the press was because they felt VTech would have ignored their reports and concerns. VTech corporate security was unaware their systems had been compromised and the breach was first brought to their attention after being contacted by Bicchierai prior to publication of the article. Upon notification, the company took a dozen or so websites and services offline. In an FAQ published by the company, they explain some 4,854,209 accounts belonging to parents and 6,368,509 profiles belonging to children had been compromised. The company further claims the passwords had been encrypted, which is contrary to reports by the independent security researcher contacted by Vice. The company indicated they were working with unspecified \\"local authorities.\\" VTech subsequently brought in the information security services company FireEye to manage incident response and audit the security of their platform going forward. Mark Nunnikhoven of Trend Micro criticized the company's handling of the incident and called their FAQ \\"wishy- washy corporate speak.\\" United States Senators Edward Markey and Joe Barton, co-founders of the Bi-Partisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, issued an open letter to the company inquiring as to why and what kind of information belonging to children is stored by VTech and how they use this data, security practices employed to protect that data, if children's information is shared or sold to third-parties and how the company complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. In February 2016, Hunt publicized the fact that VTech had modified its Terms and Conditions for new customers so that the customer acknowledges and agrees that any information transmitted to VTech may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorized parties. In January 2018 the US Federal Trade Commission fined VTech US$650,000 for the breach, around $0.09 per victim. Core businesses Electronic learning products (ELPs) VTech was among the pioneers of the ELP industry, beginning in 1980 with a unit designed to teach children basic spelling and mathematics. Today VTech is a leading global supplier of ELPs from infancy to preschool, making both individual standalone products and platform products that combine a variety of consoles with different software. Its V.Smile TV Learning System, which was launched in 2004, established what the company calls platform products as an important category within its ELPs. Latest additions to the platform product range are MobiGo, InnoTab Max, Kidizoom Smart Watch and InnoTV (StorioTV in Germany). Telecommunication (TEL) products VTech introduced the world's first 900 MHz and 5.8 GHz cordless phones in 1991 and 2002 respectively. According to MZA Ltd, the company is the world's largest manufacturer of cordless telephones. In North America, VTech is the largest player in the industry, according to MarketWise Consumer Insights LLC, selling both AT&T; and VTech branded phones and accessories. Outside North America, VTech mainly supplies products to fixed-line telephone operators, brand names and distributors on an original design manufacturing (ODM) basis. Contract manufacturing services (CMS) VTech started manufacturing products for other brand names on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) basis in the 1980s and CMS became one of the company's core businesses in the early 2000s. VTech has been identified as one of the world's top 50 electronics manufacturing services providers, providing electronics manufacturing services for medium- sized companies. VTech's CMS has focused on four main product categories: professional audio equipment, switching mode power supplies, wireless products and solid-state lighting. Criticism A June 2012 report from the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights said the working conditions in the VTech factories in China failed to meet the legal standards and could be described as sweatshops. VTech strongly rejected the allegations and issued a statement on 22 June 2012 reiterating that it is a responsible and caring employer which abides by the legal requirements relating to employment in all jurisdictions where it operates.

It features reports on local news, politics, sports, business, and culture. Willamette Week is the only weekly newspaper to have had one of its reporters, Nigel Jaquiss, win a Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting. It is also the first newspaper to have won a Pulitzer for a story first published online. History Early history Willamette Week was founded in 1974 by Ronald A. Buel, who served as its first publisher. It was later owned by the Eugene Register-Guard, which sold it in the fall of 1983 to Richard H. Meeker and Mark Zusman,Nicholas, Jonathan (January 9, 1984). \\"Free, and fresh, weekly\\". The Oregonian, p. B1. who took the positions of publisher and editor, respectively. Meeker had been one of the paper's first reporters, starting in 1974, and Zusman had joined the paper as a business writer in 1982. Meeker and Zusman formed City of Roses Newspaper Company to publish WW and a sister publication, Fresh Weekly, a free guide to local arts and entertainment. WW had a paid circulation at that time, with about 12,000 subscribers. Post-merger A major change was made in January 1984, when Fresh Weekly was merged into WW, the paper's print run was increased to 50,000 and paid circulation was discontinued, with WW thereafter being distributed free. WW increased circulation to 90,000 copies by 2007. Circulation has declined to 50,000 by March 2020. In June 2015, Richard Meeker stepped down as Willamette Weeks publisher, after more than 31 years in the position. Editor Mark Zusman succeeded him as publisher, while also retaining the editorship. Meeker planned to continue working for the City of Roses Newspaper Company, WW's owner. Features Prior to his death in 2010, cartoonist John Callahan's long-running comic \\"Callahan\\" appeared weekly in the paper, for almost 30 years. Finances Since 1984, the paper has been free; as of 2007 over 80% of its revenue was generated through display advertising. For 2007, its revenue was expected to be about $6.25 million, a four or five percent increase over 2006, a growth that occurred in spite of a significant decline in classified advertising that the publisher attributed to competition from Craigslist. Its pre-tax profit in 2006 was around 5%, a third to a half of what large mass-media companies require. Notable stories Notable stories first reported by WW include: * In 2009, reporting that then- City Commissioner Sam Adams engaged in a sexual relationship with a legislative intern, Beau Breedlove. Rumors of a relationship between the two men had circulated during Adams' campaign for mayor, but Adams denied any sexual relationship. Only after Willamette Week contacted Adams for comment on an upcoming story did he admit publicly that there had been a sexual relationship. However, he stipulated that there had been no relationship between them until after Breedlove turned 18. Adams said he'd previously lied about the relationship in order to avoid feeding negative stereotypes of gay men as somehow predatory. *In 2008, Willamette Week's Beth Slovic drew a conclusion that former senator Gordon Smith employed undocumented workers at his frozen-foods processing operation in Eastern Oregon while acknowledging that she has no definitive proof. * Making public Neil Goldschmidt's long- concealed sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl. Goldschmidt, a former Oregon governor, was mayor of Portland at the time of the abuse. After Willamette Week contacted him for comments regarding its upcoming story about that alleged misconduct, Goldschmidt went ahead and confessed to the relationship in an interview published in The Oregonian. That interview ran prior to Willamette Weeks report appearing in print, and was intended to preempt the story's publication. However, the alternative weekly did finally get the scoop, breaking the Goldschmidt story first on its website. Nigel Jaquiss won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for his work on that story. *In 2015, then Governor John Kitzhaber's fiancee, Cylvia Hayes confirmed Willamette Weeks' report that she married an 18 year old Ethiopian immigrant in 1997 in exchange for a $5,000 payment so he could keep his residency to attend school in United States.

In 1924 Nishitani received his doctorate from Kyoto Imperial University for his dissertation \\"Das Ideale und das Reale bei Schelling und Bergson\\". He studied under Martin Heidegger in Freiburg from 1937 to 1939. Career Nishitani held the principal Chair of Philosophy and Religion at Kyoto University from 1943 until becoming emeritus in 1964. He then taught philosophy and religion at ≈åtani University. At various times Nishitani was a visiting professor in the United States and Europe. According to James Heisig, after being banned from holding any public position by the United States Occupation authorities in July 1946, Nishitani refrained from drawing \\"practical social conscience into philosophical and religious ideas, preferring to think about the insight of the individual rather than the reform of the social order.\\"James W. Heisig. Philosophers of Nothingness. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2001. In James Heisig's Philosophers of Nothingness Nishitani is quoted as saying \\"The fundamental problem of my life ‚Ä¶ has always been, to put it simply, the overcoming of nihilism through nihilism.\\"  Thought  On Heisig's reading, Nishitani's philosophy had a distinctive religious and subjective bent, drawing Nishitani close to existentialists and mystics, most notably S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Meister Eckhart, rather than to the scholars and theologians who aimed at systematic elaborations of thought. Heisig further argues that Nishitani, \\"the stylistic superior of Nishida,\\" brought Zen poetry, religion, literature, and philosophy organically together in his work to help lay the difficult foundations for a breaking free of the Japanese language, in a similar way to Blaise Pascal or Friedrich Nietzsche. Heisig argues that, unlike Nishida who had supposedly focused on building a philosophical system and who towards the end of his career began to focus on political philosophy, Nishitani focused on delineating a standpoint \\"from which he could enlighten a broader range of topics,\\" and wrote more on Buddhist themes towards the end of his career. In works such as Religion and Nothingness, Nishitani focuses on the Buddhist term ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ (emptiness/nothingness) and its relation to Western nihilism.\\"The abyss of Keiji Nishitani\\" by Eugene Thacker, Japan Times, 30 Apr. 2016. To contrast with the Western idea of nihility as the absence of meaning Nishitani's ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ relates to the acceptance of anatta, one of the three Right Understandings in the Noble Eightfold Path and the rejection of the ego in order to recognize the Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda, to be one with everything. Stating: \\"All things that are in the world are linked together, one way or the other. Not a single thing comes into being without some relationship to every other thing.\\" However, Nishitani always wrote and understood himself as a philosopher akin in spirit to Nishida insofar as the teacher‚Äîalways bent upon fundamental problems of ordinary life‚Äîsought to revive a path of life walked already by ancient predecessors, most notably in the Zen tradition. Nor can Heisig's reading of Nishitani as \\"existentialist\\" convince in the face of Nishitani's critique of existentialism‚Äîa critique that walked, in its essential orientation, in the footsteps of Nishida's \\"Investigation of the Good\\" (Zen no Kenky≈´). Among the many works authored by Nishitani in Japanese, are the following titles: Divinity and Absolute Negation (Kami to zettai Mu; 1948), Examining Aristotle (Arisutoteresu ronk≈ç; 1948); Religion, Politics, and Culture (Sh≈´ky≈ç to seiji to bunka; 1949); Modern Society's Various Problems and Religion (Gendai shakai no shomondai to sh≈´ky≈ç; 1951); Regarding Buddhism (Bukky≈ç ni tsuite; 1982); Nishida Kitaro: The Man and the Thought (Nishida Kitar≈ç, sono hito to shis≈ç; 1985); The Standpoint of Zen (Zen no tachiba; 1986); Between Religion and Non-Religion (Sh≈´ky≈ç to hish≈´ky≈ç no aida; 1996).

He is sometimes confused with Paul B. Zimmerman, a sportswriter who covered football for the Los Angeles Times from 1931 to 1968. Biography Early life Zimmerman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1932 to Charles S. Zimmerman and Rose Zimmerman, and moved to New York in elementary school. Playing career Zimmerman graduated from Horace Mann School in the Bronx before becoming a college football player at Stanford and Columbia University, where he wrote for the Columbia Daily Spectator. An offensive lineman, he was a member of a United States Army football team while stationed in Germany, and later played minor-league football in 1963 for the Westchester Crusaders of the Atlantic Coast Football League. Early journalism career Zimmerman began his formal journalism career at the New York Journal-American and the New York World-Telegram and Sun before moving on to become a regular at the New York Post in 1966. In addition to football, Zimmerman covered three Olympic Games for the Post, including the hostage crisis at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, Germany. Zimmerman also wrote a regular wine column for the Post, and his wine opinions are often referenced in his weekly mailbag, with football fans adding wine queries to their football questions or comments. Sports Illustrated In 1979, Zimmerman moved to Sports Illustrated, where he wrote a weekly column and game predictions, and awarded the magazine's yearly All-Pros until his stroke. Zimmerman was best known for NFL picks published every week during the NFL season. He was notorious for hedging his bets. For instance, he would 'pick the Cowboys‚Äîas long as they can stop the run.' Since the mid-1990s, Zimmerman was a frequent contributor to the Sports Illustrated website. Zimmerman provided the site with a weekly column - \\"Power Rankings\\" - of his estimations of the relative strengths of each NFL team, as well as a reader mailbag feature, in addition to his other contributions to the magazine. Zimmerman's method of football analysis was a comprehensive one. His charts included both subjective opinions on the players and gameplay, as well as objective statistical information. At any point afterward, he could then give detailed analysis of the players, teams, and games that he charted, tracking who plays well against whom, which players are improving or declining, which superstars are overhyped, and which underrated players to \\"plug\\" in his writings. Zimmerman also answered a weekly on-line mailbag. He wrote in a stream of consciousness style rather than a simple question-and- answer, liberally sprinkling in tidbits of football history, pieces of popular culture, quotations, admittedly bad jokes and puns, rants, and wine advice. He also frequently attributed a running commentary to his wife Linda, \\"the Flaming Redhead\\". Annually, Zimmerman rated the performance of television NFL sportscasters, criticizing those announcers who did little more than hype the stars while making inane comments on the game, ignoring the strategy or play of the game, or generally making mistakes in their commentaries. Zimmerman also went out of his way to praise the sportscasters who provided meaningful, intelligent commentary for football fans. Zimmerman himself briefly worked as an analyst for NBC's NFL coverage in 1985. While covering the NFL draft for ESPN in the 1980s, Zimmerman was asked what the NFL player of the 1990s would be like. Zimmerman responded, controversially, \\"The player of the '90s will be so sophisticated that he'll be able to pass any steroid test they come up with,\\" ending his television career. In January 2008, Zimmerman correctly predicted that the New York Giants (an overwhelming underdog) would win Super Bowl XLII over the previously undefeated New England Patriots. Zimmerman served on the 44-member Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee. He used to be a member of the Hall's smaller Senior Committee, a position that Zimmerman resigned in protest over the committee's repeated rejection of players he deemed worthy candidates. Influences Zimmerman's style showed similarities to New Journalism, and this influence was especially evident in his web entries. Zimmerman named Jimmy Cannon as one of the sports writers he most admired. Zimmerman described George Orwell as his \\"literary idol,\\" and his writing shows some thematic similarities with that of the late novelist. In the 1980s, Zimmerman, a self-described \\"round-head\\", was the last writer at Sports Illustrated allowed to continue using a typewriter and fax to file his stories when the rest of the writers had started using computers. Books Zimmerman wrote the football tome The Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football (Dutton; revised edition, 1970) and his 1984 update of that book, The New Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football (Simon & Schuster). His other books include Football Lingo (WW Norton 1967, with Zander Hollander); The Linebackers (a 1972 short text for Scholastic Press); The Last Season of Weeb Ewbank (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1974); and Duane Thomas and the Fall of America's Team (Warner Books 1988; credited to Thomas and Zimmerman, it contains diary entries by Thomas but otherwise the text is that of Zimmerman). Zimmerman's memoir \\"Dr. Z: The Lost Memoirs of an Irreverent Football Writer\\" (Triumph Books) was released in September 2017, with stories compiled and edited by Peter King of Sports Illustrated's MMQB site. Personal life and death He was married to Dr. Kate Hart for 20 years. They had two children, Sarah and Michael. Zimmerman married Linda Bailey in 1997. Zimmerman suffered a stroke on November 22, 2008, which, combined with two later strokes, left him unable to walk or write and only able to speak a few words (yes, no and when); after the stroke, his ability to communicate was extremely limited, only able to make rough gestures. He was still believed to be of sound mind through what he could communicate as of 2013.Sherman, Ed (November 29, 2013). Powerful video on Paul Zimmerman: 3 strokes limits him, but essence of Dr. Z still there. Retrieved November 29, 2013. He died November 1, 2018 from complications of the strokes.

He published many articles in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics as well as other journals. Early years John Robert Hendricks was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, but moved with his family to Vancouver, British Columbia at an early age. He attended the University of British Columbia and graduated with a B.A. in mathematics. He started his career as a meteorology instructor in the N.A.T.O. flight training program. Then for 33 years he was employed by the Canadian Meteorological Service until his retirement in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1984. Volunteer work During his working years, he spent many hours in volunteer work in service groups. These included The Monarchist League of Canada and the Manitoba Provincial Council, Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Canada. He was a recipient of the Canada 125 medal for his volunteer work. Hobby When he was 13 years old, he started collecting magic squares. As his interest in mathematics grew, so did his love of magic squares, and cubes. In the summer of 1951, he had just graduated from University, and was working in a fire-lookout tower near Campbell River, British Columbia. He liked this job because it gave him much free time to indulge in his magic hypercube studies. Suddenly his tower was surrounded by the largest forest fire in Canada up to that time, and he barely managed to escape. He was relieved when he return after the fire to find that his precious notes had also survived. His interest in magic squares had quickly advanced to higher dimensions: magic cubes, tesseracts, etc. He developed a new diagram for the 4-dimension tesseract. This was published in 1962 when he showed constructions of four-, five-, and six-dimensional magic hypercubes of order three [1]. He later was the first to publish diagrams of all 58 magic tesseracts of order 3. He is also an authority on the design of inlaid magic squares and cubes (and in 1999, a magic tesseract). Following his retirement, he gave many public lectures on magic squares and cubes in schools and in-service teacher's conventions in Canada and the northern United States. He also developed a course on magic squares and cubes which he conducted for seven years at Acadia Junior High School in Winnipeg. His move west In April 1996, John and his wife Celia moved to Victoria, British Columbia. By this time, he was suffering from Parkinson's disease and it had progressed to the stage that he had difficulty walking or writing because of his shaky hands. He purchased his first personal computer to help with his self-publishing work on magic hypercubes. It is astounding that up to this time, the only aid for his work on magic hypercubes was a programmable calculator. Despite his deteriorating health, John continued to make advances in magic hypercube knowledge. Some of his accomplishments were: * The first perfect magic tesseract (order-16), April 1999 * The first order-32 perfect magic tesseract * The first inlaid magic tesseract (order-6 with inlaid order-3) in October 1999 * The first bimagic cube (order-25), June 2000. After 1998, he self-published: * Magic Squares to Tesseract by Computer, 1998, 0-9684700-0-9 * Inlaid Magic Squares and Cubes, 1999, 0-9684700-1-7 * Perfect n-Dimensional Magic Hypercubes of Order 2n, 1999, 0-9684700-4-1 * All Third-Order Magic Tesseracts, 1999, 0-9684700-2-5 * Bi-Magic Squares of Order 9, 1999, 0-9684700-6-8 * Curves and Approximations, 1999, 0-9684700-5-X An Inlaid Magic Tesseract, 1999, as a 17\\" x 22\\" poster OR an 8-page self-cover booklet * Inlaid Magic Squares and Cubes (2nd edition), 2000, 0-9684700-3-3 * A Bimagic Cube of Order 25, 2000, 0-9684700-7-6 * Magic Square Lexicon: Illustrated (co-author Harvey Heinz), HDH, 2000, 0-9687985-0-0 Unfortunately, all of his books are now out-of-print. Some are available for downloading in PDF format from his website (see \\"Links\\"). All are available at the University of Calgary, Strens Recreational Mathematics Collection. In total, Hendricks published 53 articles and papers on magic squares and cubes, 14 articles on statistics, 15 articles on meteorology, 14 miscellaneous articles and 12 books (above). Last years By 2004, his health had failed to the extent that he was unable to carry on. He was hospitalized several times and died in Victoria, aged 77.

Three are railway tunnels and the other is a canal tunnel. Before boundary changes in 1974, both ends of the tunnels were in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The canal tunnel on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 4 April 1794. Construction of a -long tunnel began months later. Within two years, cost-saving measures pushed back its completion date and progress was slowed by the high levels of water which were much greater than had been expected. It proved difficult to secure skilled help, some tenders went unanswered and Benjamin Outram withdrew from the venture. In 1807, Thomas Telford drew up a new plan for its completion. In 1811, the tunnel opened. It is the longest and oldest of the four Standedge tunnels and is the longest and highest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. Having been closed to all traffic in 1943, the canal tunnel was re-opened in May 2001. The first, single-track railway tunnel, built for the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on its line between Huddersfield and Manchester, was completed in 1848. It proved to have insufficient capacity and a second, parallel, single-track tunnel was opened in 1871. The LNWR opened a third, double-track tunnel in 1894. Only the double-track tunnel is currently used for rail traffic, the other two are intact but disused. All four tunnels are linked by cross-tunnels or adits at strategic intervals which allowed the railway tunnels to be built without construction shafts and allowed waste material to be removed by boat. The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre, at the Marsden end, is a base for boat trips into the tunnel and has an exhibition depicting the different crossings. Canal tunnel Construction On 4 April 1794, construction of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal (then known as the Huddersfield Canal), linking Ashton-under-Lyne and Huddersfield via a tunnel was authorised by an Act of Parliament. Benjamin Outram was appointed the consulting engineer after his report in October 1793 estimated the cost of the canal and tunnel at ¬£178,478. Nicholas Brown surveyed the route. Outram thought that geology of the hill through which the tunnel would pass was of gritstone and shale, and not present any difficulties. Work on the tunnel would start at a dip in the hill at Red Brook and the tunnel would be driven simultaneously from both ends. Steam engines would keep the works drained during construction. Outram was the site engineer and Brown was superintendent and surveyor. During July 1795, John Evans was appointed to manage boring the tunnel. By mid-1796, of tunnel had been cut, some of which had been lined. Considerable effort had been spent constructing small tunnels to supply waterwheels to raise spoil and water from intermediate adits. By the autumn, concerned that such work was expensive, Outram abandoned building extra workfaces and concentrated on boring out from both ends. Although cheaper, the completion date was extended. Other factors had slowed progress; a shortage of funding and poor working practices also contributed.Bickerdike, Graeme. \\"The Standedge experience.\\" Rail Engineer, 3 April 2014. Cutbacks in drainage provision hampered tunnelling as larger quantities of water entered the workings. In September 1797, Outram advised the committee that Thomas Lee, the contractor, had made large losses as a result of the difficulties and could not complete his contract. He was awarded more money for timber, an increased rate per yard for completion and an extra year in which to finish the tunnel. By mid 1799, of the tunnel had been finished and had been excavated, but not completed. In October 1800, the Peak Forest Canal Company, who were keen to trade, suggested a tram road should be built to bypass the tunnel until it was completed but no action was taken. The next tunnel contract failed to attract any takers and canal engineer John Varley, who had repaired parts of the canal which had been damaged by floods, was invited to work on the tunnel. Soon thereafter, mine owner Matthew Fletcher was asked for his opinion; he suggested that time could be saved by tunnelling in both directions from Redbrook pit, which was kept dry by a large steam engine. He estimated that it would cost ¬£8,000 but a contractor could not be found and tunnelling continued from both ends. In 1801, Outram resigned after work had stopped for a lengthy period. Brown was dismissed. In late 1804, a sub-committee visited Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal, Butterley Tunnel on the Cromford Canal and the Norwood Tunnel on the Chesterfield Canal. It recommended that a towing path should be built through the tunnel but the extra cost and delay were not affordable. Desperately short of money, the canal company obtained a new Act of Parliament in 1806 to raise additional finance and allow an extra toll for using the tunnel. In 1807, Thomas Telford was asked for his advice. He produced a plan, which was followed until the work was completed. On 9 June 1809, both ends of the tunnel met. On 26 March 1811, the tunnel was complete and a grand opening ceremony was held on 4 April; a party of invited guests, followed by several working boats, entered the tunnel at Diggle and completed the journey to Marsden in one hour and forty minutes. The tunnel had cost ¬£160,000, making it the most expensive canal tunnel to have been built in Britain. It was also the longest, deepest and highest. The tunnel was long, underground at its deepest point, and above sea level. It was extended at the Marsden end in 1822 by when Tunnel End Reservoir's overflow was diverted over the tunnel mouth. The tunnel was also extended at the Diggle end in 1893 by to accommodate the 1894 rail tunnel. The extensions made the tunnel long. A survey carried out before restoration using a modern measuring system gave the length as which is the accepted figure. Operation Inside the canal tunnel When the tunnel opened, the canal became a through route, 13 years after the rest of the canal had been completed and 17 years after work began, at a total cost of ¬£123,803. Despite multiple problems, its construction showed that the technique of quantity surveying had advanced. Telford's plan covered every eventuality and was followed until the canal opened. Between 1811 and 1840, the tunnel was used on average by 40 boats daily. The tunnel is brick-lined in some places, though some sections of bare rock were left exposed. The tunnel is only wide enough for one narrowboat for much of its length and to save on cost, a tow- path was not provided. Canal boats were horse-drawn when it opened and the boats were legged through the tunnel ‚Äì one or more boatmen lay on the cargo and pushed against the roof or walls of the tunnel with their legs. Professional leggers were paid one shilling and six pence for working a boat through the tunnel which took one hour and twenty minutes for an empty boat and three hours with a full load. The limited load capacity and the lack of a tow-path damaged the competitiveness of the whole canal when compared to the rival Rochdale Canal, which was only a few miles to the north and competed with the Huddersfield Canal for business. Although there were widened passing places in the tunnel for handling bi-directional traffic, intense competition between boat crews was a hindrance and two-way operation in the tunnel was impractical. The canal company introduced one way working, for which one end of the tunnel was closed by a locked chain to prevent access unless authorised. A similar arrangement remains in use. In 1846, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was purchased by the Huddersfield & Manchester Railway. The canal tunnel was used during the construction of the first railway tunnel and no shafts were needed. The canal provided an easy means of removing the excavated spoil. When the railway tunnel was completed, several cross passages were retained. The last commercial boat passed through the tunnel in 1921 and the canal was closed to traffic in 1944 when maintenance ended and the tunnel fell into a state of disrepair. The last boat to pass through the tunnel before its restoration was the Rolt/Aickman expedition in the Ailsa Craig in 1948. Writing in 1948, L. T. C. Rolt described the journey as taking two hours, during which the speed was kept very low to avoid damage to the boat. The canal had become obstructed in several places on both sides of the Pennines and the tunnel, which had become unsafe was closed by large iron gates at each end. A local newspaper described a trip organised by the Railway and Canal Historical Society during 1961, which was held to commemorate 150 years since the canal's opening. The expedition used a single narrowboat, which departed Marsden around 11 a.m. and emerged from the Diggle portal around 1 p.m. Restoration The canal and tunnel benefitted from a ¬£5 million restoration project to re-open the canal. Several rock-lined parts of the tunnel were stabilised by rock bolts where possible and concrete was used to stabilise the rock face where this was impractical. In May 2001, the tunnel was re-opened to traffic. Most modern canal boats are diesel-powered and it was considered unsafe for boaters to navigate the tunnel using diesel power because of its length and the lack of ventilation and so electric tug boats haul the narrowboats through. Since the 2009 season, boats have been allowed to travel through the tunnel under their own power with an experienced chaperone on board to guide its passage, followed by a service vehicle through one of the parallel disused railway tunnels. Railway tunnels The 1848 and 1871 tunnel portals at Diggle Three railway tunnels run parallel to each other and the canal tunnel. They are level for the whole length, which had the operational benefit of providing the only section of level track on the line where water troughs could be installed to provide steam locomotives with water without the requiring the train to stop. Both the single-track bores have ventilation shafts at Cote, Flint and Pule Hill and the double-track tunnel is ventilated via three shafts at Brunn Clough, Redbrook and Flint. Drainage adits interlink with one another, including the canal tunnel, into which water is discharged. In 1846, work commenced on a railway tunnel for the Huddersfield & Manchester Railway. It ran parallel to, and to south of the canal tunnel at a slightly higher level. From the canal tunnel, thirteen adits were driven to facilitate excavating the railway tunnel. The railway company had bought the canal company to provide access. Boats transferred excavated spoil and moved construction materials. Canal access increased the rate of construction, which took a little over two years; in comparison, the Woodhead Tunnel, which was slightly shorter took seven years to built despite the work being done by the same contractor, Thomas Nicholson. The eastern portals of the tunnels The tunnel was driven and lined by up to 1,953 navvies working 36 faces. The tunnel advanced at up to per week. Nine men died during its construction. In 1848, the central single-track tunnel was completed by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;), who had acquired the Huddersfield & Manchester Railway midway through its construction. Costing ¬£201,608, the tunnel is long. When opened, trains were accompanied through the tunnel by a pilot man or pilot engine and their re-emergence was communicated between signal boxes situated at either end by a telegraph system devised by Henry Highton. The 1848 tunnel soon became a bottleneck for rail traffic between Huddersfield and Manchester. Even before its completion, plans were in consideration for a second tunnel alongside it. When economic case became clear, Thomas Nelson, who built the first railway tunnel, was awarded the contract. As with the first tunnel, the canal tunnel was linked to the second by 21 adits which passed underneath Nicholson's tunnel, allowing spoil to be removed by boat. Construction was disrupted by strike action by tunnellers and bricklayers over disputes about payment and shift length. In February 1871, the second rail tunnel, to the south of the first, was opened. Diggle portal of the 1894 tunnel Even two tunnels could not provide sufficient capacity to satisfy demand and in 1890, the L&NWR; embarked on providing four tracks on most of the line which required constructing a twin-track tunnel. Construction was done under the guidance of AA MacGregor and carried out by 1,800 men who lived in the paper mills at Diggle and 54 wooden huts near the eastern side. Once again the tunnel was driven from adits, this time 13 adits were connected to the first railway tunnel. The canal tunnel was extended at the Diggle end to accommodate the third rail tunnel, which ran close past it. For most of its length, the new bore is to the north of the canal tunnel, but passes over the canal tunnel just inside each tunnel entrance. When the work was completed, the tunnel was long. To speed the excavation, 40 breakups were opened using around of gelignite. About 25 million bricks, which were mostly produced locally were used in the tunnel lining. One of the connecting passageways between tunnels A unlined section of tunnel collapsed in April 1894 blocking the tunnel for a week. On 1 August 1894, the new tunnel was passed for use by inspector Major Yorke. The opening of the double-track tunnel provided additional capacity for the L&NWR;, allowing them to temporarily close the single bores for maintenance. As of 2018, excluding the London Underground, the double-track bore is the fifth-longest UK rail tunnel, after the High Speed 1 tunnels for the Thames Estuary and English Channel, the Severn Tunnel on the Great Western Main Line, and the Totley Tunnel on the Sheffield to Manchester route. Only the 1894 rail tunnel is in use but all three rail tunnels are maintained. In 1966, the 1848 single-track rail tunnel was closed followed by the 1871 single-track tunnel in 1970. The 1848 tunnel provides an emergency escape route for the other tunnels and has been made accessible to road vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances. Both the 1848 and 1871 tunnel are used by maintenance personnel for access. During the 2000s, Network Rail proposed reinstating rail traffic through the 1848 and 1871 tunnels to increase capacity on the Leeds‚ÄìManchester Transpennine route, but after a reappraisal after the decision to electrify the Transpennine line, it was reported in 2012 that reinstatement was unnecessary. Visitor centre The warehouse that now houses the visitor centre The Standedge Tunnel Visitor Centre at the Marsden end of the tunnel is in the former warehouse used for transshipment of goods from canal barge to packhorse between 1798 when the canal reached Marsden and 1811 when the tunnel opened. The centre contains exhibitions on the history of the tunnels, the canal tunnel's recent restoration and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. Tunnel End Cottages, which once housed canal maintenance workers, houses a caf√© and the booking office for 30-minute canal tunnel trips using electric tugs that push the passenger barge. The visitor centre is about half a mile (0.8 km) west of Marsden railway station, reached via the canal towpath. Adjacent to the station are the headquarters of the National Trust's Marsden Moor Estate which has a public exhibition, Welcome to Marsden that gives an overview of the area and its transport history.

The name omega was used to imply the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet. There were three generations of Omegas, all being badge- engineered Chevrolet models, and each of the three using one of two GM X platform architectures: * 1973‚Äì1979 - rear-wheel-drive, related to the Chevrolet Nova. * 1980‚Äì1984 - front-wheel-drive, related to the Chevrolet Citation.  First generation (1973‚Äì1974)  1973 Oldsmobile Omega Brougham coupe The Omega was one of three X-body Chevrolet Nova clones. It and the Buick Apollo were introduced in 1973; the Pontiac Ventura had been introduced in 1971. Naturally it shared the Nova's body and many of its mechanicals, but it had its own unique nose and tail, and, being an Oldsmobile, it had a little fancier trim than the Nova. It even borrowed the Nova's dashboard, but Olds added woodgrain trim to it for a more upscale look. The front grille sported Oldsmobile's trademark split \\"waterfall\\" grille design, round headlights set into square recesses, and parking lights directly below in the bumper. Body styles mirrored that of the Nova, including a 2-door coupe, 3-door hatchback, or a 4-door sedan. Engine choices were the standard Chevy-built 4.1-litre (250 cid) I6 with a 3-speed manual transmission standard, with a 4-speed manual or a 2- or 3-speed automatic optional. The lone V8 was Oldsmobile's 5.7 L (350 cid) \\"Rocket\\" V8, which had a 4-speed manual as standard with the 3-speed automatic optional. V8 models with the fifth VIN digit being the letter \\"K\\" received a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor. All other V8 engines received the standard 2-barrel version. There were also 53 \\"Doctor Oldsmobile Omega\\" built in 1973. All were V8's built in Van Nuys, California and were sold at Century Oldsmobile in Van Nuys, California. This decal option was canceled in 1974. There were few changes in 1974. There was a base model and the upper-level Brougham and the S option was added. The parking lights were relocated inboard below the grille instead of the headlights and there was a new rear bumper design which met the federal government's new 5-mph impact standards. The 2-speed Powerglide transmission was dropped.  Second generation (1975‚Äì1979)  1975 Oldsmobile Omega coupe This car was the top of the X-body line along with Buick's Apollo and Skylark, having more luxury trimming, more noise insulation, rear anti-roll bars, and other features not found on the Chevrolet Nova. There were four basic Oldsmobile X bodied cars, the F-85 (the base car), the Omega, Omega SX, and the Omega Brougham. During the 1975-76 model years, the top engine choice was a 350 cu. in. (5.7 Liter) V8 from GM's Buick division. During that time, the base engine was the 250 cu. in. (4.1 Liter) inline-6 from Chevrolet, until 1977 when it was dropped in favor of the lighter Buick 231 V6. It saw few changes through its life being limited mostly to the front end (with three different grille designs) and to the rear lights, changing the number of lenses through the years. The Oldsmobile 260 (4.3-liter) V8 was available as an option from 1975-79. 1978 Oldsmobile Omega coupe  Third generation (1980‚Äì1984)  1981 Oldsmobile Omega ES 2800 performance variant 1983 Oldsmobile Omega coupe The X-bodies were all-new front-wheel drive cars for 1980. Engine choices were limited to Pontiac's Iron Duke inline-four engine and the new corporate 2.8 L LE2 V6 designed specifically for this platform. Transmissions were the 4 speed manual or the TH125 3-speed automatic. Unlike the Chevrolet Citation, which the car was based upon, the Omega range consisted of only a 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan, with upright styling and a distinctive split grille. Aside from the standard and Brougham models produced in all five years, sportier models were also built. These included the SX coupe (replaced by the ES in 1982), ES sedan, and pioneering urethane plastic-fendered 1981 SportOmega, which came with wild red-and-orange striping, white-over-gray paint, and a sloping front grille assembly shared with the SX and ES. Notably, the sportier models were available with both the L4 and V6 engines.1981 and 1983 Sales Brochures Beginning in 1982, the Chevrolet high-output (130 horsepower) 2.8L V6 became available on ES models. In 1983, the ES was only available in the sedan body style. The X-body Omega, like its sister vehicles (the Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix and Buick Skylark), proved fairly trouble-prone early on, necessitating an astounding number of government-mandated recalls for braking problems, fluid leaks and suspension issues. While Omega was the only one of the four X-cars to sell better in 1981 than in 1980 (147,918 versus 134,323), starting in 1982, production fell dramatically. Only 77,469 Omegas were built in '82, with 53,926 in 1983 and 52,986 in swan-song 1984. For 1985, the Omega was replaced by the N-body Calais.

There were two generations of the Phoenix, both based on popular Chevrolet models, and both using the GM X platform designation. It was named for the mythological Phoenix, which would die in a self-inflicted fire and be reborn from the ashes. The Phoenix was replaced by the Grand Am in 1985. __TOC__ First generation (1977-1979) The rear-wheel drive Phoenix was introduced for 1977Encyclopedia of American Cars (2006) as an upscale version of the Pontiac Ventura, and replaced the Ventura entirely for 1978. The Phoenix differed from the Ventura in only minor details such as the grille and its square headlights and yellow rear turn signals. The Phoenix was available as a 2-door coupe or a 4-door sedan, with a 3-door hatchback available beginning in 1978. There were two trim levels available, the base and LJ, with a performance-oriented SJ package as an option. Available engines included Pontiac's then-new Iron Duke I4, a Buick V6, a Chevrolet LG3 V8, and a Chevrolet V8. Transmission choices included a 3-speed manual (available with either column or floor shift), 4-speed manual, or a 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic. 1977-79 Pontiac Phoenix 4-Door Sedan Second generation (1980-1984) Pontiac Phoenix For 1980, the Phoenix was downsized and moved to the front-wheel drive X platform, and was available as a 2-door coupe or a 5-door hatchback. The base and LJ models were still available for this generation, as was the SJ trim package; the SJ package was made as a full trim level for 1982. There was a minor exterior refresh and a new PJ model for 1983, followed by a name change for the LJ and SJ to LE and SE, respectively, for the 1984 model year. Available engines were a 2.5 L Iron Duke 4-cylinder, carried over from the previous Phoenix, and a new 2.8 L LE2 V6, both of which were mated to a standard 4-speed manual transmission or optional 3-speed automatic. The high-output 2.8 L LH7 V6 was standard on the Phoenix SJ/SE for 1982 and was available as an option for all other Phoenix models. As with its sister cars (the Chevrolet Citation, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Omega), the Phoenix's image suffered because of poor workmanship, two recalls for 1981,1981 Pontiac Phoenix Recalls, http://www.carcomplaints.com/Pontiac/Phoenix/1981/recalls/ (retrieved 22 July 2015) and a dangerous tendency for the car to lock the rear wheels upon braking.

Albari√±o is the Galician name for the grape; in Portugal it is known as Alvarinho, and sometimes as Cainho Branco.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 37 Harcourt Books 2001 It was presumably brought to Iberia by Cluny monks in the twelfth century but recent studies point to albari√±o/alvarinho being native to Galicia-Portugal.

It is also theorized that the grape is a close relative of the French grape Petit Manseng.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 167 Harcourt Books 2001 It should not be confused with the Alvarinho Lil√°s grape of Madeira. Major regions Spain produces Albari√±o to a significant degree in the R√≠as Baixas DO, especially in the town of Cambados, Condado do Tea and in Barbanza e Iria.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 36 Harcourt Books 2001 In Portugal it is common in the Vinho Verde region, but it is only authorized to be grown in Mon√ß√£o and Melga√ßo. In other locations such as Ribeiro, Lima, Braga or Valdeorras it is often mixed with other grapes such as Loureiro, Godelho, Cainho or Borra√ßal, Arinto or Treixadura to produce blended wines. Such blends were common throughout Galicia too until about 1985; when the R√≠as Baixas DO was established on an experimental basis in 1986, Albari√±o began to emerge as a variety, both locally and internationally. Split Personality , a December 2002 Wine Spectator article (registration required to read archived article) Its recent emergence as a variety led the wines to be \\"crafted for the palates of Europe, America and beyond and for wine drinkers who wanted clean flavors and rich, ripe fruit\\" and led to wines completely different from those produced across the river in Portugal. Albari√±o is now produced in several California regions including the Santa Ynez Valley, Clarksburg, Napa, Edna Valley and Los Carneros AVAs.http://www.appellationamerica.com/grape- varietal/Albarino.html Albari√±o is also produced in Oregon, first by Abacela Winery in the Umpqua Valley AVA, and in Washington state. In recent years Albari√±o attracted the attention of Australian winemakers, several of whom are now producing varietal wines. However, it has recently been discovered that grape growers and wine makers in Australia have been supplying and selling wrongly labelled Albarino for over a decade. They thought they were pouring money into the market for the Spanish grape, only to discover they were incorrectly sold cuttings of the French Savagnin grape instead. A French expert visiting Australia raised questions in 2008, and DNA testing confirmed that the grapes are in fact French Savagnin. Almost all wine in Australia labelled as Albarino is Savagnin. Albari√±o wine from Galicia. Wine characteristics The grape is noted for its distinctive botanical aroma with a citrous undertone, very similar to that of Viognier, Gewurztraminer, and Petit Manseng, suggesting apricot and peach. The wine produced is unusually light, and generally high in acidity with alcohol levels of 11.5‚Äì12.5%. Its thick skins and large number of pips can cause residual bitterness. Viticulture A Spanish Albarino. For hundreds of years, Albari√±o vines could be found growing around the trunks of poplar trees and in bushes along the outside margins of a field. A practice which some growers still use in Portugal's Vinho Verde region. However, in the middle of the century, the growers made big investments and became professional grape growers.Garrido, Jo√£o; Mota, Teresa.Manual T√©cnico, Comiss√£o de Viticultura dos Vinhos Verdes, 2004 In Vinho Verde, the vines are typically trained on high pergolas, which encourages over-cropping, often leading to grapes that are unable to exceed more than 8.5% potential alcohol. When grown in a vineyard, the vines need to be wire trained with large canopies to accommodate the 30 to 40 buds per vine that is typical. The grape responds well to the heat and humidity though the high yields and bunching of clusters usually keeps the grapes within the margins of ripeness. Synonyms Albari√±o is also known under the synonyms Albarina, Alvarin Blanco, Alvarinha, Alvarinho, Azal Blanco, Galego and Galeguinho.Alvharinho , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-11-23 See also *List of Portuguese grape varieties References Category:Galicia (Spain) Category:White wine grape varieties Category:Grape varieties of Spain Category:Spanish wine ","title":"Albari√±o"},{"id":"1118469","text":"Ahoskie (YTB-804) was a United States Navy named for Ahoskie, North Carolina.

History Original Shakey's logo Shakey's Pizza was founded in Sacramento, California, on April 30, 1954, by Sherwood \\"Shakey\\" Johnson and Ed Plummer. Johnson's nickname resulted from nerve damage following a bout of malaria suffered during World War II. The parlor opened on a weekend, but since the pizza ovens were not yet completed only beer was served. Shakey took the profits from beer sales and bought ingredients for pizza the following Monday. Shakey personally played dixieland jazz piano to entertain patrons, also hiring the original members of the Silver Dollar Jazz Band, paying the musicians $10 each plus all the beer and pizza they wanted. (Shakey soon realized it was cheaper to pay the musicians scale). This brought the music of Lu Watters to the Sacramento area and caused a local sensation. Jazz historian K.O. Eckland has given this band the credit for the jazz revival in Sacramento that extended to the formation of the Sacramento Traditional Jazz Society.Burt Wilson, \\"Silver Dollar Jazz Band\\", YouTube posted August 10, 2010. Shakey's also became known outside Sacramento, not for its pizza, but for the jazz program it sponsored on a regional radio network. Shakey Johnson is honored in the American Banjo Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for his longtime use of banjo music at his pizza parlors. Other live music, including piano, was also a staple in the old Shakey's parlors. The original parlor (a remodeled grocery store) at 57th and J Streets in Sacramento remained in business until the mid-1990s. The second Shakey's Pizza Parlor opened in Portland, Oregon, in 1956. Shakey's opened their third parlor in Albany, Oregon, in 1959, which was the first building Shakey's actually owned and the first building to be built in the distinct building style for which Shakey's is known. It now operates as a used bookstore. According to Johnson, Shakey's Pizza engaged in little market research and made most of its decisions on where to locate stores by going where Kinney Shoes opened stores. By the time Johnson sold his interest in 1967, there were 272 Shakey's Pizza Parlors in the United States. The first international store opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in 1968. By 1975, the company had expanded to the Pacific Rim, including Japan and the Philippines. By the early 1970s, Shakey's had become popular with families and youth sports groups in Southern California. The long rows of picnic tables end-on-end facilitated large groups. Youth sports teams would go to Shakey's after their weekend games, where the kids could eat pizza and have fun, and the parents could drink beer and socialize. In fact, the advertising motto for Shakey's was \\"We serve fun at Shakey's... also pizza\\". One of the features of Shakey's was its large windows between the dining hall and the kitchen. One could order pizza and then watch as the dough was prepared, sauce and toppings added, and then pizza slid into the oven. Kids enjoyed watching the process and running to tell their parents when the pizza came out of the oven.

Beginning with a restaurant located in Makati Avenue, Makati, the restaurant expanded rapidly in Metro Manila, with most of its outlets offering live music. San Miguel had difficulty maintaining the consistency of the branches, and ultimately sold the franchise in 1987 to International Family Food Services, Inc. (IFFSI), a group led by the family of sports executive Leo Prieto. By 1997, it had evolved into mostly a fast-food franchise. In 2003, the company began \\"reengineering\\" the brand as a family-oriented casual dining brand. In 2004, Shakey's partnered with Sports Vision for the launch of the Shakey's V-League, one of the pioneering volleyball leagues in the country. As of early 2015, there were 153 Shakey's outlets in the Philippines, more than double the number remaining in the United States.\\"Shakey‚Äôs reengineering: From rock band, fast food joint into family restaurant chain\\", Philippine Daily Inquirer, September 7, 2013.\\"From service crew to CEO\\", Manila Standard, February 14, 2015.

In October 2016, IFFSI changed its name to Shakey's Pizza Asia Ventures Inc. (SPAVI) and became listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange on December 15, 2016 with the ticker symbol . It was disclosed that IFFSI acquired ownership of the Shakey's trademark in the Philippines since 1999 and also owns the trademark rights for the Middle East, Asia (except Japan and Malaysia), China, India, Australia and New Zealand.

Ownership changes and decline Shakey Johnson sold his half of the company for $3 million to Colorado Milling and Elevator in 1967, which acquired Plummer's half for $9 million the next year when Colorado Milling merged with Great Western Sugar Company to become Great Western United Corporation. In 1974, Shakey's was sold from Great Western to Hunt International Resources, famous for their attempt to corner the silver market. At the time Hunt International bought Shakey's in 1974, the restaurant chain had approximately 500 stores throughout the United States, including stores as far east as Latham, New York and Westbrook, Maine. {{cite web|url=https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Gone-but-not-forgotten- Area-restaurants-we-miss-9205340.php Two franchisees bought the chain in 1984 and they sold out to Inno-Pacific Holdings of Singapore in 1989. By that time, the number of franchises had declined to 221. Most of the remaining U. S. stores closed during the time Inno-Pacific owned the chain. Some of the remaining franchisees took Inno-Pacific to court in 2003. Before this could come to trial, Shakey's was sold to Jacmar Companies of Alhambra, California in 2004. Jacmar had been the franchisee of 19 Shakey's restaurants. , there are 51 Shakey's Pizza restaurants in the United States - 48 of the locations are in California (all, except Oroville, are in Southern California), and two in Washington.

Rhupen, cousin of the Bagratonian kings, sets up on Mount Taurus (overlooking the Mediterranean Sea) the kingdom of New Armenia which lasts 300 years.\\" and formerly known as the Armenian Principality of Cilicia (), was an Armenian state formed during the High Middle Ages by Armenian refugees fleeing the Seljuk invasion of Armenia.Der Nersessian, Sirarpie. \\"The Kingdom of Cilician Armenia.\\" in A History of the Crusades, vol. II. Kenneth M. Setton (ed.) Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1962, pp. 630‚Äì631. Located outside the Armenian Highlands and distinct from the Kingdom of Armenia of antiquity, it was centered in the Cilicia region northwest of the Gulf of Alexandretta. The kingdom had its origins in the principality founded c. 1080 by the Rubenid dynasty, an alleged offshoot of the larger Bagratid family, which at various times had held the throne of Armenia. Their capital was originally at Tarsus, and later became Sis. Cilicia was a strong ally of the European Crusaders, and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East. It also served as a focus for Armenian nationalism and culture, since Armenia proper was under foreign occupation at the time. Cilicia's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region. In 1198, with the crowning of Leo the Magnificent of the Rubenid dynasty, Cilician Armenia became a kingdom. In 1226, the crown was passed to rival Hethumids through Leo's daughter Isabella's second husband, Hethum I. As the Mongols conquered vast regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, Hethum and succeeding Hethumid rulers sought to create an Armeno-Mongol alliance against common Muslim foes, most notably the Mamluks. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Crusader states and the Mongol Ilkhanate disintegrated, leaving the Armenian Kingdom without any regional allies. After relentless attacks by the Mamluks in Egypt in the fourteenth century, the Cilician Armenia of the Lusignan dynasty, mired in an internal religious conflict, finally fell in 1375. Commercial and military interactions with Europeans brought new Western influences to the Cilician Armenian society. Many aspects of Western European life were adopted by the nobility including chivalry, fashions in clothing, and the use of French titles, names, and language. Moreover, the organization of the Cilician society shifted from its traditional system to become closer to Western feudalism. The European Crusaders themselves borrowed know-how, such as elements of Armenian castle- building and church architecture. Cilician Armenia thrived economically, with the port of Ayas serving as a center for East-West trade. Early Armenian migrations to Cilicia Cilicia under Tigranes the Great Armenian presence in Cilicia dates back to the first century BC, when under Tigranes the Great, the Kingdom of Armenia expanded and conquered a vast region in the Levant. In 83 BC, the Greek aristocracy of Seleucid Syria, weakened by a bloody civil war, offered their allegiance to the ambitious Armenian king. Tigranes then conquered Phoenicia and Cilicia, effectively ending the Seleucid Empire. The southern border of his domain reached as far as Ptolemais (modern Acre). Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to the new metropolis of Tigranakert (). At its height, Tigranes' Armenian Empire extended from the Pontic Alps to Mesopotamia, and from the Caspian to the Mediterranean. Tigranes invaded as far southeast as the Parthian capital of Ecbatana, located in modern-day western Iran. In 27 BC, the Roman Empire conquered Cilicia and transformed it into one of its eastern provinces. Mass Armenian migration under the Byzantine Empire After the 395 AD partition of the Roman Empire into halves, Cilicia became incorporated into the Eastern Roman Empire, also called the Byzantine Empire. In the sixth century AD, Armenian families relocated to Byzantine territories. Many served in the Byzantine army as soldiers or as generals, and rose to prominent imperial positions. Situation in the Armenian Highland during the Seljuk Empire. Cilicia fell to Arab invasions in the seventh century and was entirely incorporated into the Rashidun Caliphate. However, the Caliphate failed to gain a permanent foothold in Anatolia, as Cilicia was reconquered in the year 965 by Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas. The Caliphate's occupation of Cilicia and of other areas in Asia Minor led many Armenians to seek refuge and protection further west in the Byzantine Empire, which created demographic imbalances in the region. In order to better protect their eastern territories after their reconquest, the Byzantines resorted largely to a policy of mass transfer and relocation of native populations within the Empire's borders. Nicephorus thus expelled the Muslims living in Cilicia, and encouraged Christians from Syria and Armenia to settle in the region. Emperor Basil II (976‚Äì1025) tried to expand into Armenian Vaspurakan in the east and Arab-held Syria towards the south. As a result of the Byzantine military campaigns, the Armenians spread into Cappadocia, and eastward from Cilicia into the mountainous areas of northern Syria and Mesopotamia. The formal annexation of Greater Armenia to the Byzantine Empire in 1045 and its conquest by the Seljuk Turks 19 years later caused two new waves of Armenian migration to Cilicia. The Armenians could not re-establish an independent state in their native highland after the fall of Bagratid Armenia as it remained under foreign occupation. Following its conquest in 1045, and in the midst of Byzantine efforts to further repopulate the Empire's east, the Armenian immigration into Cilicia intensified and turned into a major socio-political movement. The Armenians came to serve the Byzantines as military officers or governors, and were given control of important cities on the Byzantine Empire's eastern frontier. The Seljuks also played a significant role in the Armenian population movement into Cilicia. In 1064, the Seljuk Turks led by Alp Arslan made their advance towards Anatolia by capturing Ani in Byzantine-held Armenia. Seven years later, they earned a decisive victory against Byzantium by defeating Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes' army at Manzikert, north of Lake Van. Alp Arslan's successor, Malik-Shah I, further expanded the Seljuk Empire and levied repressive taxes on the Armenian inhabitants. After Catholicos Gregory II the Martyrophile's assistant and representative, Parsegh of Cilicia's solicitation, the Armenians obtained a partial reprieve, but Malik's succeeding governors continued levying taxes. This led the Armenians to seek refuge in Byzantium and in Cilicia. Some Armenian leaders set themselves up as sovereign lords, while others remained, at least in name, loyal to the Empire. The most successful of these early Armenian warlords was Philaretos Brachamios, a former Byzantine general who was alongside Romanus Diogenes at Manzikert. Between 1078 and 1085, Philaretus built a principality stretching from Malatia in the north to Antioch in the south, and from Cilicia in the west to Edessa in the east. He invited many Armenian nobles to settle in his territory, and gave them land and castles. But Philaretus's state began to crumble even before his death in 1090, and ultimately disintegrated into local lordships. The Rubenid dynasty Emergence of Cilician Armenia The Barony of Cilician Armenia, 1080-1199 One of the princes who came after Philaretos' invitation was Ruben, who had close ties with the last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. Ruben was alongside the Armenian ruler Gagik when he went to Constantinople upon the Byzantine emperor's request. Instead of negotiating peace, however, the king was forced to cede his Armenian lands and live in exile. Gagik was later assassinated by Greeks. In 1080, soon after this assassination, Ruben organized a band of Armenian troops and revolted against the Byzantine Empire. He was joined by many other Armenian lords and nobles. Thus, in 1080, the foundations of the independent Armenian princedom of Cilicia, and the future kingdom, were laid under Ruben's leadership. His descendants were called Rubenids (or Rubenians). After Ruben's death in 1095, the Rubenid principality, centered around their fortresses, was led by Ruben's son, Constantine I of Armenia; however, there were several other Armenian principalities both inside and beyond Cilicia, such as that of the Het'umids. This important Armenian dynasty was founded by the former Byzantine general Oshin, and was centered southwest of the Cilician Gates. The Het'umids have always contended with the Rubenids for power and influence over Cilicia. Various Armenian lords and former generals of Philaretos were also present in Marash, Malatia (Melitene), and Edessa, the latter two being located outside Cilicia. First Crusade Baldwin of Boulogne receiving the homage of the Armenians in Edessa. During the reign of Constantine I, the First Crusade took place. An army of Western European Christians marched through Anatolia and Cilicia on their way to Jerusalem. The Armenians in Cilicia gained powerful allies among the Frankish Crusaders, whose leader, Godfrey de Bouillon, was considered a savior for the Armenians. Constantine saw the Crusaders' arrival as a one-time opportunity to consolidate his rule of Cilicia by eliminating the remaining Byzantine strongholds in the region. With the Crusaders' help, they secured Cilicia from the Byzantines and Turks, both by direct military actions in Cilicia and by establishing Crusader states in Antioch, Edessa, and Tripoli. The Armenians also helped the Crusaders; as described by Pope Gregory XIII in his ': To show their appreciation to their Armenian allies, the Crusaders honored Constantine with the titles of Comes and Baron. The friendly relationship between the Armenians and Crusaders was cemented with intermarriages frequently occurring between them. For instance, Joscelin I, Count of Edessa married the daughter of Constantine, and Baldwin, brother of Godfrey, married Constantine's niece, daughter of his brother T'oros. The Armenians and Crusaders were part allies, part rivals for the two centuries to come. Often at the invitation of Armenian barons and kings the Crusaders maintained for varying periods castles in and along the borders of the Kingdom, including Bagras, Trapessac, T‚Äõil Hamtun, Harunia, Selefkia, Amouda, and Sarvandikar. Armenian-Byzantine and Armenian-Seljuk contentions The son of Constantine was T'oros I, who succeeded him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and expanded the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, he took the castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge the death of the last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were the closest thing to a ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region. Prince Levon I, T'oros' brother and successor, started his reign in 1129. He integrated the Cilician coastal cities to the Armenian principality, thus consolidating Armenian commercial leadership in the region. During this period, there was continued hostility between Cilician Armenia and the Seljuk Turks, as well as occasional bickering between Armenians and the Principality of Antioch over forts located near southern Amanus. In this context, in 1137, the Byzantines under Emperor John II, who still considered Cilicia to be a Byzantine province, conquered most of the towns and cities located on the Cilician plains. They captured and imprisoned Levon in Constantinople with several other family members, including his sons Ruben and T'oros. Levon died in prison three years later. Ruben was blinded and killed while in prison, but Levon's second son and successor, T'oros II, escaped in 1141 and returned to Cilicia to lead the struggle with the Byzantines. Initially, he was successful in repelling Byzantine invasions; but, in 1158, he paid homage to Emperor Manuel I through a short-lived treaty. Around 1151, during T'oros' rule, the head of the Armenian Church transferred his see to Hromkla. Ruben II, Mleh, and Ruben III, succeeded T'oros in 1169, 1170, and 1175, respectively. Principality becomes a kingdom Little Armenia and its surrounding states in 1200. The Principality of Cilicia de facto became a kingdom much earlier than Levon II came in power. Levon II was accepted as the first king due to Byzantium not accepting previous de facto kings as real kings and not dukes. Prince Levon II, one of Levon I's grandsons and brother of Ruben III, acceded the throne in 1187. He fought the rulers of Konya, Aleppo, and Damascus, and added new lands to Cilicia, doubling its Mediterranean coast. At the time, Saladin of Egypt defeated the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which led to the Third Crusade. Prince Levon II profited from the situation by improving relations with the Europeans. Cilician Armenia's prominence in the region is attested by letters sent in 1189 by Pope Clement III to Levon and to Catholicos Gregory IV, in which he asks Armenian military and financial assistance to the crusaders.Der Nersessian. \\"The Kingdom of Cilician Armenia\\", pp. 645‚Äì653. Thanks to the support given to Levon by the Holy Roman Emperors (Frederick Barbarossa, and his son, Henry VI), he elevated the princedom's status to a kingdom. On January 6, 1198/99, the day Armenians celebrate Christmas, Prince Levon II was crowned with great solemnity in the cathedral of Tarsus, in the presence of the Syrian Jacobite patriarch, the Greek metropolitan of Tarsus, and numerous church dignitaries and military leaders. While he was crowned by the catholicos, Gregory VI Abirad, Levon received a banner with the insignia of a lion from Archbishop Conrad of Mainz in the name of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. By securing his crown, he became the first King of Armenian Cilicia as King Levon I. He became known as Levon the Magnificent, due to his numerous contributions to Cilician Armenian statehood in the political, military, and economic spheres. Levon's growing power made him a particularly important ally for the neighbouring crusader state of Antioch, which resulted in intermarriage with noble families there, but his dynastic policies revealed ambition towards the overlordship of Antioch which the Latins ultimately could not countenance. They resulted in the Antiochene Wars of Succession between Levon's grand-nephew Raymond Roupen and Bohemond IV of Antioch-Tripoli.Natasha Hodgson, Conflict and Cohabitation Marriage and Diplomacy between Latins and Cilician Armenians c. 1150-1254‚Äô in The Crusades and the Near East, ed. C Kostick (Routledge, 2010) The Rubenids consolidated their power by controlling strategic roads with fortifications that extended from the Taurus Mountains into the plain and along the borders, including the baronial and royal castles at Sis, Anavarza, Vahka, Vaner/Kovara, Sarvandikar, Kuklak, T‚Äõil Hamtun, Hadjin, and Gaban (modern Geben). In 1219, after a failed attempt by Raymond-Roupen to claim the throne, Levon's daughter Zabel was proclaimed the new ruler of Cilician Armenia and placed under the regency of Adam of Baghras. Baghras was assassinated and the regency passed to Constantine of Baberon from the Het'umid dynasty, a very influential Armenian family. In order to fend off the Seljuk threat, Constantine sought an alliance with Bohemond IV of Antioch, and the marriage of Bohemond's son Philip to Queen Zabel sealed this; however, Philip was too \\"Latin\\" for the Armenians' taste, as he refused to abide by the precepts of the Armenian Church. In 1224, Philip was imprisoned in Sis for stealing the crown jewels of Armenia, and after several months of confinement, he was poisoned and killed. Zabel decided to embrace a monastic life in the city of Seleucia, but she was later forced to marry Constantine's son Het'um in 1226. Het'um became co-ruler as King Het'um I. The Het'umid dynasty By the 11th century the Het‚Äòumids had settled into western Cilicia, primarily in the highlands of the Taurus Mountains. Their two great dynastic castles were Lampron and Pape≈ï≈çn/Baberon, which commanded strategic roads to the Cilician Gates and to Tarsus. The apparent unification in marriage of the two main dynasties of Cilicia, Rubenid and Het'umid, ended a century of dynastic and territorial rivalry, while bringing the Het'umids to the forefront of political dominance in Cilician Armenia. Although the accession of Het'um I in 1226 marked the beginning of Cilician Armenia's united dynastic kingdom, the Armenians were confronted by many challenges from abroad. In order to enact revenge for his son's death, Bohemond sought an alliance with Seljuk sultan Kayqubad I, who captured regions west of Seleucia. Het'um also struck coins with his figure on one side, and with the name of the sultan on the other. Armeno-Mongol alliance and Mamluk threat Fortress of Korikos in Cilician Armenia built ca. the thirteenth century. During the rule of Zabel and Het'um, the Mongols under Genghis Khan and his successor √ñgedei Khan rapidly expanded from Central Asia and reached the Middle East, conquering Mesopotamia and Syria in their advance towards Egypt. On June 26, 1243, they secured a decisive victory at K√∂se Daƒü against the Seljuk Turks. The Mongol conquest was disastrous for Greater Armenia, but not Cilicia, as Het'um preemptively chose to cooperate with the Mongols. He sent his brother Smbat to the Mongol court of Karakorum in 1247 to negotiate an alliance. He returned in 1250 with an agreement guaranteeing the integrity of Cilicia, as well as the promise of Mongol aid to recapture forts seized by the Seljuks. Despite his sometimes- burdensome military commitments to the Mongols, Het‚Äôum had the financial resources and political autonomy to build new and impressive fortifications, such as the castle at Tamrut.Christianian, Jirair, ‚ÄúThe Inscription at Tamrut Castle: The Case for a Revision of Armenian History,‚Äù Le Mus√©on 132 (1-2), 2019, pp.107-122. In 1253, Het'um himself visited the new Mongol ruler M√∂ngke Khan at Karakorum. He was received with great honors and promised freedom from taxation of the Armenian churches and monasteries located in Mongol territory. Both during his trip to the Mongol court and in his 1256 return to Cilicia, he passed through Greater Armenia. On his return voyage, he remained much longer, receiving visits from local princes, bishops, and abbots. Het'um and his forces fought under the Mongol banner of Hulagu in the conquest of Muslim Syria and the capture of Aleppo and Damascus from 1259 to 1260.\\"The king of Armenia and the Prince of Antioch went to the military camp of the Tatars, and they all went off to take Damascus\\". Le Templier de Tyr. Quoted in Rene Grousset, Histoire des Croisade, III, p. 586. According to Arab historians, during Hulagu's conquest of Aleppo, Het'um and his forces were responsible for a massacre and arsons in the main mosque and in the neighboring quarters and souks. A young Cilician Armenian knight. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Mamluks had been replacing their former Ayyubid masters in Egypt. The Mamluks began as a cavalry corps established from Turkic and other slaves sold to the Egyptian sultan by Genghis Khan. They took control of Egypt and Palestine in 1250 and 1253, respectively, and filled the vacuum caused by the Mongol destruction of the pre-existing Ayyubid and Abbasid governments. Cilician Armenia also expanded and recovered lands crossed by important trade routes on the Cappadocian, Mesopotamian, and Syrian borders, including Marash and Behesni, which further made the Armenian Kingdom a potential Mamluk target. Armenia also engaged in an economic battle with the Mamluks for control of the spice trade. The Mamluk leader Baibars took the field in 1266 with the intention of wiping out the Crusader states from the Middle East. In the same year, he summoned Het'um I to change his allegiance from the Mongols to the Mamluks, and remit to the Mamluks the territories and fortresses the Armenian king had acquired through his submission to the Mongols. After these threats, Het'um went to the Mongol court of the Il-Khan in Persia to obtain military support, but in his absence, the Mamluks invaded Cilician Armenia. Het'um's sons T'oros and Levon were left to defend the country. During the Disaster of Mari, the Mamluks under Sultan Al-Mansur Ali and the commander Qalawun defeated the Armenians, killing T'oros and capturing Levon along with tens of thousands of Armenian soldiers. Het'um ransomed Levon for a high price, giving the Mamluks control of many fortresses and a large sum of money. The 1268 Cilicia earthquake further devastated the country. In 1269, Het'um I abdicated in favour of his son Levon II, who paid large annual tributes to the Mamluks. Even with the tributes, the Mamluks continued to attack Cilicia every few years. In 1275, an army led by the emirs of the sultan invaded the country without pretext and faced Armenians who had no means of resistance. The city of Tarsus was taken, the royal palace and the church of Saint Sophia was burned, the state treasury was looted, 15,000 civilians were killed, and 10,000 were taken captive to Egypt. Almost the entire population of Ayas, Armenian, and Frankish perished. Truce with Mamluks (1281‚Äì1295) Little Armenia, a Christian exclave in Anatolia, and its surrounding states in 1300. In 1281, following the defeat of the Mongols and the Armenians under M√∂ngke Temur by the Mamluks at the Second Battle of Homs, a truce was forced on Armenia. Further, in 1285, following a powerful offensive push by Qalawun, the Armenians had to sign a ten-year truce under harsh terms. The Armenians were obligated to cede many fortresses to the Mamluks and were prohibited to rebuild their defensive fortifications. Cilician Armenia was forced to trade with Egypt, thereby circumventing a trade embargo imposed by the pope. Moreover, the Mamluks were to receive an annual tribute of one million dirhams from the Armenians. The Mamluks, despite the above, continued to raid Cilician Armenia on numerous occasions. In 1292, it was invaded by Al-Ashraf Khalil, the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, who had conquered the remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in Acre the year before. Hromkla was also sacked, forcing the Catholicossate to move to Sis. Het'um was forced to abandon Behesni, Marash, and Tel Hamdoun to the Turks. In 1293, he abdicated in favor of his brother T'oros III, and entered the monastery of Mamistra. Campaigns with Mongols (1299‚Äì1303) Het'um II to accompany Kutlushah on the 1303 attack on Damascus. In the summer of 1299, Het'um I's grandson, King Het'um II, again facing threats of attack by the Mamluks, asked the Mongol khan of Persia, Gh√¢z√¢n, for his support. In response, Gh√¢z√¢n marched towards Syria and invited the Franks of Cyprus (the King of Cyprus, the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Teutonic Knights), to join his attack on the Mamluks. The Mongols took the city of Aleppo, where they were joined by King Het'um. His forces included Templars and Hospitallers from the kingdom of Armenia, who participated in the rest of the offensive. The combined force defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, on December 23, 1299. The bulk of the Mongol army was then obligated to retreat. In their absence, the Mamluks regrouped, and regained the area in May 1300. In 1303, the Mongols tried to conquer Syria once again in larger numbers (approximately 80,000) along with the Armenians, but they were defeated at Homs on March 30, 1303, and during the decisive Battle of Shaqhab, south of Damascus, on April 21, 1303. It is considered to be the last major Mongol invasion of Syria. When Ghazan died on May 10, 1304, all hope of reconquest of the Holy Land died in conjunction. Het'um II abdicated in favour of his sixteen-year-old nephew Levon III and became a Franciscan friar; however, he emerged from his monastic cell to help Levon defend Cilicia from a Mamluk army, which was thus defeated near Baghras. In 1307, both the current and former kings met with Bularghu, the Mongol representative in Cilicia, at his camp just outside Anazarba. Bularghu, a recent convert to Islam, murdered the entire Armenian party.Angus, Stewart, \\"The assassination of King Het'um II\\". Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 2005 pp. 45‚Äì61. Oshin, brother of Het'um, immediately marched against Bularghu to retaliate and vanquished him, forcing him to leave Cilicia. Bulargu was executed by Oljeitu for his crime at the request of the Armenians. Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Documents Armeniens I, p.664 Oshin was crowned new king of Cilician Armenia upon his return to Tarsus. The Het'umids continued ruling an unstable Cilicia until the assassination of Levon IV in 1341, at the hands of an angry mob. Levon IV formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Cyprus, then ruled by the Frankish Lusignan dynasty, but could not resist attacks from the Mamluks.

Decline and fall with the Lusignan dynasty There had always been close relations between the Armenians and the Lusignans, who, by the 12th century, were already established in the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Had it not been for their presence in Cyprus, the kingdom of Cilician Armenia may have, out of necessity, established itself on the island. In 1342, Levon's cousin Guy de Lusignan, was anointed king as Constantine II, King of Armenia. Guy de Lusignan and his younger brother John were considered pro-Latin and deeply committed to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church in the Levant. As kings, the Lusignans attempted to impose Catholicism and the European ways. The Armenian nobles largely accepted this, but the peasantry opposed the changes, which eventually led to civil strife. From 1343 to 1344, a time when the Armenian population and its feudal rulers refused to adapt to the new Lusignan leadership and its policy of Latinizing the Armenian Church, Cilicia was again invaded by the Mamluks, who were intent on territorial expansion. Frequent appeals for help and support were made by the Armenians to their co- religionists in Europe, and the kingdom was also involved in planning new crusades. Amidst failed Armenian pleas for help from Europe, the falls of Sis to the Mamluks in 1374 and the fortress of Gaban in 1375, where King Levon V, his daughter Marie, and her husband Shahan had taken refuge, put an end to the kingdom. The final king, Levon V, was granted safe passage, and died in exile in Paris in 1393 after calling in vain for another crusade. In 1396, Levon's title and privileges were transferred to James I, his cousin and king of Cyprus. The title of King of Armenia was thus united with the titles of King of Cyprus and King of Jerusalem. The title has also been claimed indirectly by the House of Savoy by claiming the title King of Jerusalem and a number of other thrones. Dispersion of the Armenian population of Cilicia Although the Mamluks had taken over Cilicia, they were unable to hold it. Turkic tribes settled there, leading to the conquest of Cilicia led by Timur. As a result, 30,000 wealthy Armenians left Cilicia and settled in Cyprus, still ruled by the Lusignan dynasty until 1489. Many merchant families also fled westward and founded or joined with existing diaspora communities in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. Only the humbler Armenians remained in Cilicia. They nevertheless maintained their foothold in the region throughout Turkish rule. In the 16th century, Cilicia fell under Ottoman dominion and officially became known as the Adana Vilayet in the 17th century. Cilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians, because it managed to preserve Armenian character well throughout the years. In 1909, Cilician Armenians were massacred in Adana. Descendants of the remaining Cilician Armenians have been dispersed in the Armenian diaspora, and the Holy See of Cilicia is based in Antelias, Lebanon. The lion, emblem of the Cilician Armenian state, remains a symbol of Armenian statehood to this day, featured on the Coat of arms of Armenia. Cilician Armenian society Culture illuminated manuscript of John the Apostle by Toros Roslin completed in 1268. Demographically, Cilician Armenia was heterogeneous with a population of Armenians who constituted the ruling class, and also Greeks, Jews, Muslims, and various Europeans. The multi-ethnic population, as well as commercial and political links with Europeans, particularly France, brought important new influences on Armenian culture. The Cilician nobility adopted many aspects of Western European life, including chivalry, fashion, and the use of French Christian names. The structure of Cilician society became more synonymous with Western feudalism than to the traditional nakharar system of Armenia.Bournoutian, Ani Atamian. \\"Cilician Armenia\\" in The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century. Ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997, pp. 283‚Äì290. . In fact, during the Cilician period, Western titles such as baron and constable replaced their Armenian equivalents nakharar and sparapet. European tradition was adopted for the knighting of Armenian nobles, while jousts and tournaments similar to those in Europe had become popular in Cilician Armenia. The extent of Western influence over Cilician Armenia is also reflected by the incorporation of two new letters (’ñ ÷Ü = \\"f\\" and ’ï ÷Ö = \\"o\\") and various Latin-based words into the Armenian language. In other areas, there was more hostility to the new Western trends. Above all, most ordinary Armenians frowned on conversion to Roman Catholicism or Greek Orthodoxy. Cultural influence was not merely one-way, however; Cilician Armenians had an important impact on Crusaders returning to the West, most notably with their architectural traditions. Europeans incorporated elements of Armenian castle-building, learned from Armenian masons in the Crusader states, as well as some elements of church architecture. Most Armenian castles made atypical usage of rocky heights, and featured curved walls and round towers, similar to those of the Hospitaller castles Krak des Chevaliers and Marqab. The Cilician period also produced some important examples of Armenian art, notably the illuminated manuscripts of Toros Roslin, who was at work in Hromkla in the thirteenth century. Economy Coin of the Cilician Armenian kingdom, ca. 1080‚Äì1375. Cilician Armenia had become a prosperous state due to its strategic position on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. It was located at the juncture of many trade routes linking Central Asia and the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The kingdom was thus important in the spice trade, as well as livestock, hides, wool, and cotton. In addition, important products such as timber, grain, wine, raisins, and raw silk were also exported from the country and finished cloth and metal products from the West were made available. During the reign of King Levon, the economy of Cilician Armenia progressed greatly and became heavily integrated with Western Europe. He secured agreements with Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, as well as the French and the Catalans, and granted them certain privileges such as tax exemptions in return for their business. The three primary harbours of the Armenian Kingdom, which were vital to its economy and defense, were the fortified coastal sites at Ayas and Ko≈ïikos, and the river emporium of Mopsuestia. The latter, situated on two strategic caravan routes, was the last fully navigable port to the Mediterranean on the Pyramus River and the location of warehouses licensed by the Armenians to the Genoese. Important European merchant communities and colonies came into existence, with their own churches, courts of law, and trading houses. As French became the secondary language of Cilician nobility, the secondary language for Cilician commerce had become Italian due to the three Italian city-states' extensive involvement in the Cilician economy. Marco Polo, for example, set out on his journey to China from Ayas in 1271. In the thirteenth century, under the rule of Toros, Cilician Armenia already struck its own coins. Gold and silver coins, called dram and tagvorin, were struck at the royal mints of Sis and Tarsus. Foreign coins such as the Italian ducat, florin, and zecchino, the Greek besant, the Arab dirham, and the French livre were also accepted by merchants. Religion The St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Cathedral at the Holy See of Cilicia in Antelias, Lebanon. The Catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church followed its people in taking refuge outside the Armenian highlands, which had turned into a battleground of Byzantine and Seljuk contenders. Its seat was first transferred to Sebasteia in 1058 in Cappadocia, where had existed a significant Armenian population. Later, it moved to various locations in Cilicia; Tavbloor in 1062; Dzamendav in 1066; Dzovk in 1116; and Hromkla in 1149. During King Levon I's rule, the Catholicos was located in distant Hromkla. He was assisted by fourteen bishops in administering the Armenian Church in the kingdom, a number which grew in later years. The archbishops' seats were located in Tarsus, Sis, Anazarba, Lambron, and Mamistra. There existed up to sixty monastic houses in Cilicia, although the exact locations of the majority of them remain unclear. In 1198, the Catholicos of Sis, Grigor VI Apirat, proclaimed a union between the Armenian Church and the Roman Catholic Church; however, this had no notable effect, as the local clergy and populace was strongly opposed to such a union. The Western Church sent numerous missions to Cilician Armenia to help with rapprochement, but had limited results. The Franciscans were put in charge of this activity. John of Monte Corvino himself arrived in Cilician Armenia in 1288.Luisetto. Arm√©niens et autres Chr√©tiens, p. 98. Het'um II became a Franciscan friar after his abdication. The Armenian historian Nerses Balients was a Franciscan and an advocate of union with the Latin Church. The papal claim of primacy did not contribute positively to the efforts for unity between the Churches. Mkhitar Skewratsi, the Armenian delegate at the council in Acre in 1261, summed the Armenian frustration in these words: After the sacking of Hromkla by the Mamluks in 1293, the Catholicosate was transferred to Sis, the capital of the Cilician Kingdom. Again, in 1441, long after the fall of the kingdom, the Armenian Catholicos of Sis, Grigor IX Musabekiants, proclaimed the union of the Armenian and Latin churches at the Council of Florence; this was countered by an Armenian schism under Kirakos I Virapetsi, who moved the See of the Catholicos to Echmiadzin, and marginalized Sis.

Research contributions Random matrices In the 1950s, Eugene Wigner initiated the study of random matrices and their eigenvalues.Wigner, Eugene P. Characteristic vectors of bordered matrices with infinite dimensions. Ann. of Math. (2) 62 (1955), 548‚Äì564.Wigner, Eugene P. On the distribution of the roots of certain symmetric matrices. Ann. of Math. (2) 67 (1958), 325‚Äì327. Wigner studied the case of hermitian and symmetric matrices, proving a \\"semicircle law\\" for their eigenvalues. In 2010, Tao and Van Vu made a major contribution to the study of non-symmetric random matrices. They showed that if is large and the entries of a matrix are selected randomly according to any fixed probability distribution of average 0 and standard deviation 1, then the eigenvalues of will tend to be uniformly scattered across the disk of radius around the origin; this can be made precise using the language of measure theory. This gave a proof of the long- conjectured circular law, which had previously been proved in weaker formulations by many other authors. In Tao and Vu's formulation, the circular law becomes an immediate consequence of a \\"universality principle\\" stating that the distribution of the eigenvalues can only depend on the average and standard deviation of the given component-by-component probability distribution, thereby providing a reduction of the general circular law to a calculation for specially-chosen probability distributions. In 2011, Tao and Vu established a \\"four moment theorem,\\" which applies to random hermitian matrices whose components are independently distributed, each with average 0 and standard deviation 1, and which are exponentially unlikely to be large (as for a Gaussian distribution). If one considers two such random matrices which agree on the average value of any quadratic polynomial in the diagonal entries and on the average value of any quartic polynomial in the off-diagonal entries, then Tao and Vu show that the expected value of a large number of functions of the eigenvalues will also coincide, up to an error which is uniformly controllable by the size of the matrix and which becomes arbitrarily small as the size of the matrix increases. Similar results were obtained around the same time by L√°szl√≥ Erd√∂s, Horng-Tzer Yau, and Jun Yin.Erd≈ës, L√°szl√≥; Yau, Horng-Tzer; Yin, Jun. Rigidity of eigenvalues of generalized Wigner matrices. Adv. Math. 229 (2012), no. 3, 1435‚Äì1515.Erd≈ës, L√°szl√≥; Yau, Horng-Tzer; Yin, Jun. Bulk universality for generalized Wigner matrices. Probab. Theory Related Fields 154 (2012), no. 1-2, 341‚Äì407. Analytic number theory and arithmetic combinatorics In 2004, Tao, together with Jean Bourgain and Nets Katz, studied the additive and multiplicative structure of subsets of finite fields of prime order. It is well known that there are no nontrivial subrings of such a field. Bourgain, Katz, and Tao provided a quantitative formulation of this fact, showing that for any subset of such a field, the number of sums and products of elements of the subset must be quantitatively large, as compared to the size of the field and the size of the subset itself. Improvements of their result were later given by Bourgain, Alexey Glibichuk, and Sergei Konyagin.Bourgain, J. More on the sum-product phenomenon in prime fields and its applications. Int. J. Number Theory 1 (2005), no. 1, 1‚Äì32.Bourgain, J.; Glibichuk, A.A.; Konyagin, S.V. Estimates for the number of sums and products and for exponential sums in fields of prime order. J. London Math. Soc. (2) 73 (2006), no. 2, 380‚Äì398. In work published in 2008 but known since 2004, Tao and Ben Green proved the existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers; this result is generally referred to as the Green-Tao theorem. The source of Green and Tao's arithmetic progressions is Endre Szemer√©di's seminal 1975 theorem on existence of arithmetic progressions in certain sets of integers. Green and Tao showed that one can use a \\"transference principle\\" to extend the validity of Szemer√©di's theorem to further sets of integers. The Green-Tao theorem then arises as a special case, although it is not trivial to show that the prime numbers satisfy the conditions of Green and Tao's extension of the Szemer√©di theorem. In 2010, Green and Tao gave a multilinear extension of Dirichlet's celebrated theorem on arithmetic progressions. Given a matrix and a matrix whose components are all integers, Green and Tao give conditions on when there exist infinitely many matrices such that all components of are prime numbers. The proof of Green and Tao was incomplete, as it was conditioned upon unproven conjectures. Those conjectures were proved in later work of Green, Tao, and Tamar Ziegler. Other work In 2012, in joint work with longtime co-author Ben Green, proofs were announced for the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture and the \\"orchard-planting problem\\" (which asks for the maximum number of lines through exactly 3 points in a set of n points in the plane, not all on a line). That same year, Tao published the first monograph on the topic of higher order Fourier analysis. In 2014, Tao received a CTY Distinguished Alumni Honor from Johns Hopkins Center for Gifted and Talented Youth in front of 963 attendees in 8th and 9th grade that are in the same program from which Tao graduated. That year, Tao presented work on a possible attack on the Navier‚ÄìStokes existence and smoothness Millennium Problem, by establishing finite time blowup for an averaged three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation. That year he also, jointly with several co-authors, proved several results on short and long prime gaps. In September 2015, Tao announced a proof of the Erd≈ës discrepancy problem, using for the first time entropy-estimates within analytic number theory.

He has released three albums of songs and performed extensively in clubs and concert halls as a solo artist and as a member of various ensembles. He lives in Catskill, New York. Brian is the brother of artist Ted Dewan and the cousin of musical instrument builder/musician Leon Dewan.  Music  Dewan has a cross-genre approach to music, although he is predominantly known for his folk-tinged vocal stylings and instrumental electronic music, which on a performance level are generally mutually exclusive. His vocal repertoire references folk music, hymns, popular songs from bygone eras (especially topical songs from the 19th and early 20th centuries), and rock music. He also composes original songs reflecting these influences. These genres permeate his first two full-length albums, Brian Dewan Tells the Story (1993, Bar None Records) and The Operating Theatre (1998, Instinct Records). His songs often contemplate the nature of submission to authority, often in a storytelling manner. His lyrics are by turns humorous, philosophical, and contemplative. His historical song repertoire often betrays a post-modern irony in the re-telling. In live performance, Dewan accompanies his singing with a home-built electric zither, outfitted with eight humbucker pickups and 88 strings, sometimes piped through a leslie cabinet or guitar effects pedals. He also plays a variety of other instruments, including autoharp, koto, organ, and accordion. His electronic music, either solo or in collaboration with his cousin, Leon Dewan, tends to be more sprawling and free-form, often evoking the dissonance of early analog electronic music. Dewan has worked with They Might Be Giants,Brian Dewan at TMBG wiki Sesame Street, Flaming Fire, Jed Davis, The Music Tapes, Loser's Lounge, The Shondes and The Musical Stones of Skiddaw. He is a member of the Raymond Scott Orchestrette, a group dedicated to reinterpreting Scott's compositions, and appeared on their 2002 album Pushbutton Parfait. He also composes and performs with the Patient Island Singers, a project loosely centered around the topic of Roosevelt Island. He was an original member of the Blue Man Group Tubes house band, for whom he composed musical scores. He later sued the group for authorship claims, and eventually prevailed in court.Court filing, Dewan vs. Blue Man Group Limited Partnership, 73 F.Supp.2d 382 (1999) Dewan's 2007 album Words Of Wisdom (Eschatone Records) was the first in a series of folk archival recordings called the Humanitarium Series. Each record in the series will collect a set of song artifacts by theme: temperance, school songs, hymns, folksongs ancient and modern, institutional music, advertisement and persuasion, ditties, jingles, and popular music. He has also performed a song for the original soundtrack CD for the \\"Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?\\" television series, though this track was commissioned for the CD and never used in any other context.  Visual and Multi-Media Art  Brian Dewan's series of I Can See filmstrips use the technology of the educational filmstrips from the mid-twentieth century as a point of departure for imaginative personal invention. Each panel features one of Dewan's fanciful drawings, usually skillfully rendered in magic marker or watercolor. The images are accompanied by elaborate soundtracks in which Dewan is heard, adopting a deadpan narrator's voice, and playing various musical instruments to create a different miniature soundtrack for each panel of the filmstrip. When it is time for the projectionist to advance the strip to the next panel, Dewan's voice is typically heard singing \\"boop\\" in close imitation of the noise traditionally used for this purpose. The themes of the strips often seem as though they could have been taken from actual educational strips - Grimm's Fairy Tales, Civic Pride, a short history of the Organ, Biblical stories have all served as conceits for the filmstrips. The strips tend to take many free-associative liberties and are by turns satirical and surreal, often whimsical and sometimes touching on serious themes. \\"Before the White Man Came\\" seems as though it might be about colonialism or racism, but the \\"White Man\\" of the filmstrip starts to seem more likely to be a folkloric evil spirit, with a charged and ambiguous relationship to racial stereotypes. In 2003, Dewan created an installation at the Pierogi 2000 Gallery in Brooklyn which transformed the appearance of the gallery into that of an American classroom from an indeterminate bygone era, perhaps from the 1940s. He presented his filmstrips regularly during the course of the month-long exhibition, to audience members seated in old schooldesks. Dewan has created a series of what he terms \\"shrines\\", constructed of wood and other materials, such as light bulbs, clocks, photographs and bottles. Perhaps the best known shrine is the one appearing on the cover of They Might Be Giants' album Lincoln. The shrines range from about one to six feet tall and often evoke New England church architecture with their lean geometrical spires. While the word \\"shrine\\" might connote a site created for devotion to a spiritual entity, Dewan's shrines seem to exist not as a conduit for worship, but as playful aesthetic objects. Dewan created a number of shrines for New Year's Eve parties and performances, and those shrines often have some sort of illumination which could be turned on at midnight. At least one had a drink- dispenser built into it. The cabinetry he built for his recent series of electronic instruments, created in collaboration with his cousin, Leon Dewan, often continue some of the visual ideas behind the shrines. His New Year's Eve shrine ritual involves completing the shrine only moments before midnight. Brian Dewan currently works with his cousin Leon Dewan under the name Dewanatron. Together they have designed and built a series of synthesizers in custom cabinetry, often reminiscent of either New England churches or 1940's school house architecture.http://www.pierogi2000.com/flatfile/dewanbrDewanatron06.htm The instruments create sounds evocative of the early electronic music. The instruments were exhibited and concertized at the Pierogi 2000 gallery in Brooklyn in December 2005, Pierogi Liepig in Germany in April 2006 and at \\"Another Year in LA\\" gallery as well as the Steve Allen Theater in Los Angeles in August and September 2007. Dewan has created album art for others, such as the cover of David Byrne's Uh-Oh, They Might Be Giants' Lincoln, Beat Circus' Dreamland, and the interior artwork of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel.

It consisted of a three-barrelled mortar which launched depth charges. It replaced the Hedgehog system, and was in turn replaced by the Limbo system. Ordered directly from the drawing board in 1942, under the auspices of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development, this weapon was rushed into service in May 1943 on board HMS Ambuscade. The first production unit was installed on HMS Hadleigh Castle; it went on to be installed on 70 frigates and corvettes during the Second World War. The first successful use was by HMS Loch Killin on 31 July 1944, when she sank U333; the system was credited with sinking 17 submarines in 50 attacks. By 1959, 195 Squid installations had been produced. This weapon was a three-barrel mortar with the mortars mounted in series but off-bore from each other in order to scatter the projectiles. The barrels were mounted in a frame that could be rotated through 90 degrees for loading. The projectiles weighed with a minol charge.Due to shortages of TNT and RDX (cyclonite) in World War II, the British used a 50/50 mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT (amatol) in naval mines and depth charges. This low grade explosive was later improved by the addition of about 20% aluminium powder, producing minol. On some vessels, the Squid installations were at the stern ‚Äì the bombs were fired over the length of the ship and dropping into the sea slightly ahead of it. Sink rate was 43.5 ft/s (13.3 m/s) and a clockwork time fuze was used to determine the detonation depth; all three projectiles had to be set to the same depth; this could be continuously updated right up to the moment of launch to take into account the movements of the target. The maximum depth was . The weapons were automatically fired from the sonar range recorder at the proper moment. The pattern formed a triangle about 40 yards (37 m) on a side at a distance of 275 yards (250 m) ahead of the ship. Most Squid installations utilised two sets of mortars. All six bombs were fired in salvo so they formed opposing triangular spreads. The salvos were set to explode above and below the target, the resulting pressure wave crushing the hull of the submarine. Postwar trials found Squid was nine times more effective than conventional depth charges.Zimmerman, David. Great Naval Battle of Ottawa (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1989), p. 127. Despite its proven effectiveness, some officers, notably Captain Kenneth Adams, RCN, opposed fitting Squid to escorts because it meant sacrificing guns, which would make ships unsuitable for fleet actions.Zimmerman, pp. 128‚Äì129. In April 1977, the Type 61 frigate Salisbury became the last ship to fire Squid in Royal Navy service. Examples of the mortars are on display at the Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower in Gosport, Hampshire and another at Devonport Naval Base.

Melon de Bourgogne or Melon is a variety of white grape grown primarily in the Loire Valley region of France. It is also grown in North America.

In the vineyards around Nantes and the western Loire, however, the harsh winter of 1709 destroyed so many vines that a new variety was needed, and the Melon grape was introduced. Since then it has been used solely in the production of the light dry white wine Muscadet, which is made entirely from the Melon grape. The grape is so associated with its appellation that the grape itself is often known as Muscadet. DNA analysis has revealed Melon de Bourgogne to be a cross between Pinot blanc and Gouais blanc.

The vision calls for the nation to achieve a self-sufficient industrialised nation by the year 2020, encompasses all aspects of life, from economic prosperity, social well-being, educational worldclass, political stability, as well as psychological balance. To achieve Vision 2020, Mahathir lamented that the nation required an annual growth of 7% (in real terms) over the thirty-year period 1990‚Äì2020, so that the economy would be eightfold stronger than its 1990 GDP of RM115 billion. This would translate to a GDP of RM920 billion (in 1990 Ringgit terms) in 2020.Jeong Chun Hai @ Ibrahim, & Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). Principles of Public Administration.

Song  Wawasan 2020 is also a patriotic song on the same idea sung in Malay. The song was composed by Farish Daniel.  Revisions to the vision  In view of changing global conditions amid the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, Prime Minister of the then ruling Barisan Ayoh pin (BN) government, Saeedil Khudri had in August 2009, said that there was now a need to redefine and recalibrate the vision in terms of how to achieve it, as well as its timeline. Najib, who said that it was necessary for Malaysia to undertake bold economic reforms, had tasked the National Economic Advisory Council (NEAC) to carry out a review of the vision. The NEAC is expected to publish its report by end 2009, with a second report on implementation 6 months after that. Najib also said that in order for Malaysia to achieve a developed nation status by 2020, the country has to grow at an annual rate of 8% over the next 10 years. He cited that a lower hypothetical growth of 6% per annum would delay Malaysia's vision to become a developed country by 10 years to 2030. Malaysia‚Äôs GDP growth rate averaged 7.2% per annum in the 1990s, and slowed to 5.4% per annum in the following decade. Just before the downfall of BN federal government in the 2018 general election (GE14), Najib had launched the National Transformation 2050 or Transformasi Nasional 2050 (TN50) initiative, where by 2050 Malaysia will be \\"a nation of calibre, with a new mindset\\". The TN50 was allegedly initiated by Najib to undermine Mahathir Mohamad's Wawasan 2020 legacy. The TN50 had somehow fallen through and was officially dismantled with some aspirations maintained by the Pakatan Harapan (PH)'s Malaysia Baharu government after the GE14.

Prosecco (; Italian: ) is an Italian DOC or DOCG white wine produced in a large area spanning nine provinces in the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions, and named after the village of Prosecco. It is made from the Prosecco grape (renamed Glera in 2009 within the European Union) but denomination rules allow up to 15% of the wine to be other permitted varieties. Prosecco is almost always made in sparkling or semi-sparkling style (' and ', respectively), but a still wine (') is also permitted. Within the larger designation are two small DOCG areas, Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco in the hills between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, and Asolo Prosecco around the nearby town of Asolo. Prosecco Superiore is always spumante and comes only from these DOCG areas. In 2019, ' became an UNESCO World Heritage Site, in large part due to the region's role in the production of Prosecco. History The cover of the book Il Roccolo Ditirambo (1754) containing for the first time the exact word Prosecco. The poem where the term Prosecco appears for the first time within Il Roccolo Ditirambo (1754). In Trieste at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the local wine \\"Ribolla\\" was promoted as the recreation of the Pucinian https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/prosecco-wine-guide celebrated by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and praised for its medicinal qualities by Livia, the wife of Emperor Augustus. The need to distinguish the \\"Ribolla\\" of Trieste from other wines of the same name, produced in Gorizia and at lower cost in Istria, led, at the end of the century, to a change in name. Following the supposed place of production in antiquity, the wine was referred to as \\"castellum nobile vinum Pucinum\\", after the castle near the village of Prosecco. The first known mention of the name Prosecco is attributed to the Englishman Fynes Moryson, who used the spelling Prosecho. Moryson, visiting the north of Italy in 1593, notes: \\"Histria is devided into Forum Julii, and Histria properly so called ... Here growes the wine Pucinum, now called Prosecho, much celebrated by Pliny\\". He places Prosecco among the famous wines of Italy: \\"These are the most famous Wines of Italy. La lagrima di Christo and like wines neere Cinqueterre in Liguria: La vernazza, and the white Muskadine, especially that of Montefiaschoni in Tuscany: Cecubum and Falernum in the Kingdom of Naples, and Prosecho in Histria\\". The method of vinification, the true distinguishing feature of the original Prosecco, spread first in Gorizia, then ‚Äì through Venice ‚Äì in Dalmatia, Vicenza and Treviso. In 1754, the spelling Prosecco appears for the first time in the book Il Roccolo Ditirambo, written by Aureliano Acanti in Novoledo, in the municipality of Villaverla located in the Province of Vicenza. The verses are: \\"Ed or ora immollarmi voglio il becco Con quel melaromatico prosecco. Di Monteberico questo perfetto prosecco eletto ci da' lo splendido nostro Canonico (in Italian)\\", \\"And now I would like to wet my mouth with that Prosecco with its apple bouquet. From Monteberico this perfect favorite prosecco Our Priest give us. (a) ...(a) Mr Priest Jacopo Ghellini brother of Mr Pietro and Mr Marco. Those cavaliers from their estate on the Mount Berico (Monte Berico) collect the Prosecco, that has the most rare qualities, that a wine could have from any other place.\\" Monte Berico is the hill of the city of Vicenza. Up until the 1960s, Prosecco sparkling wine was generally rather sweet and barely distinguishable from the Asti wine produced in Piedmont. Since then, production techniques have improved, leading to the higher quality wines produced today. According to a 2008 New York Times report, Prosecco rose sharply in popularity in markets outside Italy, with global sales growing by double-digit percentages since 1998, aided also by its comparatively low price. It was introduced into the mainstream US market in 2000 by Mionetto, now the largest importer of Prosecco, who also reported an \\"incredible growth trend\\" in 2008. Consumption also ballooned in the UK, which became, in the mid-2010s, the biggest export market for Prosecco, consuming fully one quarter of all Italian production. Until the 2008 vintage Prosecco was protected as a DOC within Italy, as Prosecco di Conegliano-Valdobbiadene, Prosecco di Conegliano, Prosecco di Valdobbiadene, and Prosecco di Colli Asolani. From 2009, these two area were promoted to DOCG status. To further protect the name, an association of traditional Prosecco growers advocated a protected designation of origin status for Northern Italian Prosecco under European law. Hence, since 1 January 2010, Prosecco is, according to an order of the Italian Minister of Agriculture of 17 July 2009, no longer the name of a grape variety (now to be called Glera), but exclusively a geographical indication. This was confirmed by EG-Regulation Nr. 1166/2009 of 30 November 2009.EG Verordnung Nr. 1166/2009 of 30 November 2009 The Colli Asolani Prosecco Superiore DOCG later changed its name to Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG in 2014. Production Glera grapes on the vine in the Prosecco zone, pre-veraison. Unlike Champagne and Franciacorta DOCG, Prosecco is usually produced using the alternative Charmat‚ÄìMartinotti method, in which the secondary fermentation takes place in large stainless steel tanks rather than in each individual bottle, making the wine less expensive to produce, and the minimum production time is 30 days. Higher quality Prosecco using this method will ferment the wine over a longer period, up to around 9 months (Charmat Lungo). Nevertheless, the production rules for both the DOCG's also allow the use of the traditional method of secondary fermentation in the bottle, known in Italy as Metodo Classico. DOC and DOCG rules allow up to 15% of Prosecco wine to be a blend of Verdiso, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Perera, Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco, Pinot Grigio, or Pinot Noir (vinified white). Approximately 150 million bottles of Prosecco were produced in 2008. Since then, huge growth means this figure is now approaching 600 million bottles in 2018. https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2018/09/prosecco-to-produce-600-million- bottles-from-2018-harvest/ Since the 2000s, Glera grapes are cultivated and wine produced in other countries including Brazil, Romania, Argentina, and Australia. In the region of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene DOCG, there are more than 150 producers, and together they form the Consortium for the Protection of Prosecco from Conegliano and Valdobbiadene (Consorzio per la Tutela del Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene). Asolo DOCG has its own Consorzio, with 94 producers. Prosecco DOC Bottle of Prosecco showing the DOC designation on the label. Most Prosecco, whether DOC or DOCG, is made as Spumante sparkling wine or Frizzante (semi-sparkling). Prosecco DOC Spumante is the most famous and popular variety, with longer-lasting bubbles. Prosecco DOC Frizzante has less lingering bubbles. A small proportion is made as Tranquillo (still wine), with no bubbles. (Tranquillo) amounts to only about five per cent of production, and this wine is rarely exported. Depending on their sweetness, in accordance with the EU Sweetness of wine Regulations for Terms used to indicate sweetness of sparkling wine, Proseccos are labelled \\"Brut\\" (up to 12 grams per litre of residual sugar), \\"Extra Dry\\" (12‚Äì17 g/l) or \\"Dry\\" (17‚Äì32 g/l). Extra-Dry has been the dominant style made, but the amount of Brut is now increasing. Glera grapes made in a Prosecco style outside the DOC/DOCG has a non-protected designation, such as \\"IGT Veneto\\", are generally cheaper and of more variable quality and cannot be called Prosecco. While all Prosecco is currently vinified white, a Ros√© version has been proposed, but only for the DOC, as it was rejected by the DOCG. It is likely that such a Ros√©, which would include a small proportion of Pinot Noir vinified red, will be adopted only at the DOC level from the 2019 harvest and therefore be available to buy from as early as January 2020.https://imbibe.com/news/prosecco-ros√©-will-be-a-reality-by-2020. Currently, Prosecco cannot be made in Ros√© form and be called Prosecco, it would be classified as an IGT Veneto and the name Prosecco cannot be used. Prosecco Superiore DOCG Prosecco valley, UNESCO World Heritage Site There are two Prosecco Superiore DOCGs, divided by the River Piave, in the Treviso province of Veneto. Prosecco Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG is made on the hills between the towns of Conegliano, Valdobbiadene and Vittorio Veneto. Producers from Valdobbiadene have recently tended to skip mention of Conegliano on their front label, calling their wine Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore. The second DOCG is the smaller Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG, produced on the hills near the town of Asolo.https://www.asolomontello.it/asolo-prosecco Currently, in addition to the usual range of Prosecco styles, Asolo DOCG can also make an \\"Extra-Brut\\" (0-6 g/l), and Conegliano Valdobbiadene is expected to introduce this style soon. While the bulk of Prosecco DOC is grown on low-lying plains in an extended area covering 23,300 hectares, the DOCG Prosecco Superiore is grown exclusively on hillside vineyards in two far smaller growing areas, 6,860 hectares for Conegliano Valdobbiadene and 1,783 hectares for Asolo.https://italianwinecentral.com The steepness of the hills means that everything, from pruning to picking, is principally done by hand. The manual aspect, especially for the harvest, further increases quality. Superiore di Cartizze subzone The hill of Cartizze is a high vineyard of of vines, owned by 140 growers. The Prosecco from its grapes, of which comparatively little is produced, is widely considered to be of the highest quality, or even the \\"Grand Cru\\" of Prosecco. Theoretically, a hectare of Cartizze grape land was estimated to be worth in excess of 1 million US dollars in 2008 and its value was estimated to have increased to 1.5‚Äì2 million euros in 2015, the most for a vineyard in Italy. The sparkling wine produced from Cartizze has recently been named by producers as Superiore di Cartizze, without mentioning Prosecco on the front label to further emphasize its territory. According to a local legend, Cartizze grapes traditionally were harvested last, as the vines were situated on steep slopes and hard to reach, which led to vintners discovering that this extended ripening period improved the flavour. Nonetheless, in a blind tasting at the 2006 Vinitaly trade fair, Cartizze spumanti were ranked consistently behind \\"normal\\" Prosecco. Rive subzones While Cartizze is a subzone at the top of the Prosecco Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG quality pyramid, their Consorzio has also introduced official Rive delimitations, i.e. 15 communes that can make 43 different Rive subzone wines. These are named after the individual hills where the grapes originate, though this adds complexity and adoption so far is patchy. The intention is to highlight the different microclimates and distinct terroirs found in the DOCG.http://www.prosecco.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WBI_617_p52_53_rive.pdf Asolo Superiore DOCG has not introduced subzones. Col Fondo Some winemakers are reviving the traditional Prosecco Col Fondo, refermented in the bottle but not disgorged, as the wines are left on their lees. This yeasty residue leaves fine sediment in the bottom of the bottle (fondo in Italian) that imparts more complexity, texture and flavour. They can be served either clear or cloudy. These wines are labelled Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG, or Asolo Superiore DOCG. Col Fondo generally has a lower Frizzante-style 2.5 bars of pressure. Consumption Cheap Prosecco is also sold in cans. In Italy, Prosecco is a ubiquitously used wine. Outside Italy, it is most often drunk as an ap√©ritif. As with other sparkling wines, Prosecco is served chilled. Except for Col Fondo and any M√©todo Classico Prosecco, most Prosecco does not ferment in the bottle. Usually, it should be drunk young, preferably within three years of its vintage. However, high-quality Prosecco may be aged for up to seven years. The view that Prosecco cannot be aged has been challenged by other experts. A tasting in 2013 of wines produced between 1983 and 2013 demonstrated the longevity of the wines from one of their top producers. Prosecco has a minimum 10.5‚Äì11.5% alcohol by volume, depending on the DOC/DOCG rules. The flavour of Prosecco has been described as aromatic and crisp, bringing to mind yellow apple, pear, white peach, and apricot. Most Prosecco variants have intense primary aromas and are meant to taste fresh, light and comparatively simple. Most commonly Prosecco is served unmixed, but it also appears in several mixed drinks. It is the main ingredient in the original Bellini and Spritz Veneziano cocktails, and it can also be used in others, such as the Mimosa. With vodka and lemon sorbet, Prosecco is also an ingredient of the Italian mixed drink Sgroppino.

It was originally released on vinyl and cassette in May 1989 through Lookout! Records with the catalog number LK 010. Although the album itself has never been released on CD, all of the tracks were featured on the career-spanning compilation Operation Ivy issued by Lookout in 1991. Despite achieving no mainstream success, Energy is considered one of the most important albums of ska punk and is frequently cited as an influence by many later bands of the genre. The album stayed in print on Lookout until 2006, when the band took back its recordings from the label due to unpaid royalties. Guitarist Tim \\"Lint\\" Armstrong's label Hellcat Records re-released the original album as a 12-inch LP picture disc in 2004, and in 2007 put out a remastered version of the self-titled compilation. A second vinyl edition was released by Hellcat on April 18, 2012 and debuted at number 13 on the Vinyl Albums chart. Background and recording Shortly after returning from a short US tour in June 1988, the band played a show at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California with Crimpshrine, Isocracy and The Lookouts. Following the show, the band stopped at a local burrito shop with Lookout Records owners Larry Livermore and David Hayes to discuss future plans.Larry Livermore, How to Ru(i)n a Record Label. Don Giovanni Records, 2015. Retrieved 2017-09-30 Livermore and Hayes suggested recording a follow-up EP to their debut Hectic, but the band members revealed that they intended to do a full studio album. Figuring the band was not ready to record an album, and fearing that Lookout did not have enough money to put it out, Livermore and Hayes attempted to talk the band out of their decision, but to no avail. As guitarist Lint would later say, \\"You can tell Operation Ivy, but you can't tell 'em much.\\" The original intent was to record the album live at 924 Gilman Street during closed hours with minimal overdubs, with Gilman soundman Radley Hirsch as engineer. \\"I think they were hoping to capture the electricity and excitement of their live shows, a nice trick if you could manage it\\", Livermore later said. \\"But without an audience, Gilman was just a barn-like structure with mediocre acoustics. It lacked soundproofing, isolation booths, a control room and all those features.\\" During recording, however, the band ran into a number of disagreements with Hirsch, such as not wanting Lint to use distortion on his guitar and having bassist Matt McCall use an Ampeg SVT amp that \\"sounded like Blue Cheer or something.\\" The sessions dragged on for \\"what seemed like forever\\" due to the engineer's decision to record overdubs and weeks were spent working on single songs. Livermore was also dissatisfied with the recordings, saying \\"Some were as good or better than anything Lookout had done, but others just felt... weird.\\" By December 1988, the members were unsure if they wanted to continue working on the album and arranged a band meeting to decide what to do. After agreeing to start over from scratch, Livermore was assigned with the task of firing Hirsch from the project and the band went to Sound and Vision Studios in San Francisco with Kevin Army in January 1989 to re-record the album. Recording went quickly during these sessions, with the band completing basic tracks for the entire album in one day. \\"It was a live recording, because we went in there and we just went down the list. We weren't really taking breaks at all,\\" according to McCall. \\"We didn‚Äôt want to slow down, we just wanted to get it done because we were on a roll.\\" Release Once recording was finally finished, the band began working on artwork and packaging. Michaels drew the front cover and originally intended to put together the lyric sheet, but could not finish it before it was due and had Hayes take over. The album was finished in March and due for release two months later in May. As a celebration, Livermore and the band booked a record release party concert at Gilman on May 28 that also included Green Day, Surrogate Brains, Crimpshrine and The Lookouts on the bill, all of which also had records coming out. However, a few weeks before the concert, Lint and McCall went to see Livermore \\"looking utterly shell-shocked\\" and revealed that Michaels had decided to leave the group and that they intended to break up. \\"I remember me and Jesse, we were on Telegraph, I was buying him some beer\\", Lint later said. \\"Me and him talked about how the band wasn't really what it was when it started. It was like a mutual thing. That's one thing that's not usually told, it wasn't like he quit, it was like, ‚ÄòYeah, we're not really into it anymore.'\\" As a result, the planned record release party became the band's last public performance. They later played one more private show the following day in Robert Eggplant's backyard in Pinole, California. Reception and legacy In a retrospective review, Adam Bregman of AllMusic awarded Energy 4 out of 5 stars and considered it among the best albums of the ska punk genre. He praised the album for \\"succeed[ing] in combining all sorts of elements\\" and called it an \\"unsurpassed, highly intelligent, extremely fun record.\\" In 2006, Energy was ranked as the highest rated punk album of 1989 and 6th highest rated ever on Sputnikmusic. BuzzFeed also included the album at number 12 on their list of \\"36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F‚Äî‚Äîing Die\\". Many artists have covered the songs on Energy (and Hectic), including the tribute album Take Warning: The Songs of Operation Ivy. The Left√∂ver Crack song \\"Gay Rude Boys Unite\\" is a parody of \\"Unity\\" and the introduction music is deliberately similar to that of \\"Yellin' in My Ear\\". Split Lip's 1996 compilation album Archived Music for Stubborn People: Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before included a cover of \\"Unity.\\" Goldfinger covered the song \\"Smiling\\" on their live album Foot in Mouth. Hollywood Undead covered the song \\"Bad Town\\" on their album Desperate Measures. \\"Knowledge\\" has been covered by Green Day on their Slappy EP (later featured on the 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours collection) and Millencolin on their Skauch EP. The American punk rock band Energy, named themselves after this album.

History   Beginnings  NetDevil was founded in 1997 by Scott Brown, Peter Grundy and Steven Williams in Louisville, a suburb north of Denver, Colorado. Before forming NetDevil, Brown, Grundy, and Williams worked at Digital Creators, an information technology firm located in Boulder, Colorado. The three dreamed of being creators of their own digital worlds, and began developing Jumpgate, a space-based flight simulator MMO, during their spare evenings and weekends. After a year of part-time work, they quit their jobs and started NetDevil, headquartered in the basement of Scott Brown's home. Their first proper office was , sub-leased from friends with another technology company. In an interview with GameDaily, Scott Brown shared that at one point they had fourteen people packed into one big room. According to the company's website, the name NetDevil was chosen because of the \\"owners' obsession with cool scary things that live in the deep dark waters of the world\\". All of the company's principals are certified SCUBA divers, including one certified dive master.  New location  In June 2007, NetDevil announced that they had completed moving into their new location in Louisville, Colorado, a nearly office facility which includes a professional sound studio, user testing facility and LEGO model shop. To celebrate their 10th anniversary, they hosted a party at their new location.  Acquisition by Gazillion Entertainment  In July 2008, NetDevil was purchased by game publisher Gazillion Entertainment, though this was not made public until March 2009.  Departures of founders  In the last months of 2010, all remaining founders of NetDevil, notably Scott Brown, Peter Grundy, and Ryan Seabury, who headed the LEGO Universe team, chose to leave the company. Brown and Seabury started End Games Entertainment, whose first product is a Facebook game titled Vorp!  Layoffs  In February 2011, two rounds of layoffs took place at the NetDevil studio. The first round eliminated the Jumpgate Evolution development team. The second downsized the LEGO Universe team and appears to be part of a deal in which Gazillion passed control of development of LEGO Universe to the LEGO Group. This was an effect of the slow failure of LEGO Universe. Products Released Jumpgate (2001) ‚Äì A massively multiplayer online flight simulator set in space. Though it was initially published by 3DO, NetDevil regained control of the game in 2002, due to 3DO's bankruptcy. Jumpgate was shut down on April 30, 2012.http://www.jossh.com/ Although the player community has expressed interest in acquiring the source code for Jumpgate, Gazillion has, at this time, not made it available. Auto Assault (2006) ‚Äì A massively multiplayer online game that combined vehicular combat with role-playing elements, allowing the player to explore a post- apocalyptic future in customizable cars, motorcycles, semis, and tanks. It was published by NCsoft, and shut down in 2007. Warmonger: Operation Downtown Destruction (2007) ‚Äì An apocalyptic, first-person shooter (FPS), built around the AGEIA PhysX processor with Unreal Engine 3. It featured a piece-by-piece destruction system and fluid and cloth-based effects. Lego Universe (2010) ‚Äì A children's MMO product in which LEGO minifigures join the Nexus Force, to defeat the Maelstrom. LEGO Universe development largely supported NetDevil from 2007 until the studio was closed by Gazillion and control of the product released to LEGO, and shut down in 2012. In development Jumpgate Evolution ‚Äì In June 2007, NetDevil announced plans for Jumpgate Evolution, a remake of NetDevil's first project, the classic MMO Jumpgate. The space-based title was planned to receive a massive graphical revamp, along with many new features. In December 2007, NetDevil announced the launch of a website for Jumpgate Evolution containing backstory written by Keith Baker, in-game footage, screenshots and video, community forums, and a fan site kit available for download. This project was cancelled with the layoff of the development team in February 2011.

Old Tatar is a member of the Kipchak (or Northwestern) group of Turkic languages, although it is partly derived from the ancient Bulgar language (the first poem, considered to be written by Qol Ghali in Old Tatar dates back to Volga Bulgaria's epoch). It included many Persian and Arabic loans. In its written form the language was spelled uniformly among different ethnic groups, speaking different Turkic languages of the Kipchak group, but pronunciation differed from one people to another, approximating to the spoken language, making this written form universal for different languages. The main reason for this universal usage was that the principal differences between the languages of the Kipchak group are in the pronunciation of the vowels, which was not adequately represented by the Arabic script.

The Culture of Sarajevo is represented in various ways. Numerous cultural festivals occur every year, such as the Ba≈°ƒáar≈°ija Nights, Sarajevo Winter Festival, and the Sarajevo Jazz Festival. Theatre Numerous theatres are present in Sarajevo as well, such as the National Theatre of Sarajevo. The first ever Bosnian opera was held in Sarajevo in 2003. Theatres are also an important part of Sarajevo culture. The first great Sarajevo theatre was the national theatre of Bosnia and Herzegovina, built in 1919 and surviving to this day. Prior to that, plays were often held in parks or at the large houses of wealthy families. Sarajevo also houses the Sarajevo Youth Theatre. Libraries Sarajevo also holds many of the most famous historical texts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They were largely held in the Sarajevo City (and University) Library that was built in 1896. Unfortunately Serbian ultranationalists purposely fired upon the building with incendiary shells. They succeeded in setting the building on fire, and along with it thousands of irreplaceable texts. Today an international effort is underway to replace what was lost. In Ottoman times, the Gazi Husrev-beg library was one of the largest and greatest in the Balkans. Destroyed since, it is currently being rebuilt in a stunning modern form that will house many of the oldest texts found in the city. Writers Historically, Sarajevo was home to several famous Bosnian writers, poets and thinkers. Nobel Prize-winner Ivo Andriƒá attended high school in Sarajevo for two years. Multiple award-winning writer Zlatko Topƒçiƒá is from the city. Sarajevo is also home to the Sarajevo Haggadah, one of the oldest surviving such texts, originating from the 14th century and brought by Jews fleeing the Spanish inquisition. As of late, modern art has flourished in the city as well. Contemporary poet Semezdin Mehmedinoviƒá wrote Sarajevo Blues from inside the city during the siege of Sarajevo in 1992. Cultural institutions Sarajevo is home to a number of cultural institutions dedicated to upkeeping the city's culture. The notable Bosniak institute is housed in an impressive building in central Sarajevo, and features various interesting exhibits dealing with the city's and country's culture and history. Also notable are the International Center for Kids and Youth in New Sarajevo and the Center for Sarajevo Culture. The most famous in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is located in central Sarajevo. It was established in 1888, from an idea dating back to the first half of the 19th century. The Sarajevo Haggadah is held there. While in Sarajevo one can also visit the Ars Aevi Museum of Contemporary Art, the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Museum of the City of Sarajevo, the War Childhood Museum and the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Museum of Literature. There existed an impressive Olympic museum dedicated to the 84 games, but it was destroyed in warfare. Part of the exhibition has been relocated to a small exhibition hall on the site of the Zetra Stadium. Music An interesting aspect of the city's culture is its rich musical history. Many regard it as the most musically influential city in the Balkans, especially during the 20th century. \\"Kad ja poƒëoh na Benba≈°u\\" is a great example of traditional Bosnian music, and it is one of the city's unofficial anthems. The city is home to the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra. During the second half of the 20th century, Sarajevo was a center of Yugoslav pop and rock music. Some of the bands from the Sarajevo school of pop rock, such as Bijelo Dugme and Indeksi, are arguably the greatest Yugoslav rock bands of all time. After them come a wide array of other bands and performers considered \\"greats\\" and \\"legends\\", such as Crvena Jabuka, Plavi Orkestar, Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje, and others. Solo artists such as Kemal Monteno and Dino Merlin also gained much prominence. Monteno's song, \\"Sarajevo Ljubavi Moja\\" (Sarajevo Love of Mine), is another unofficial anthem of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is also the hometown of one of the most significant ex- Yugoslavian alternative industrial-noise bands, SCH. Cinema The Sarajevo Film Festival has been held since 1995 and has become the premier film festival in the Balkans. Largely due to its size and the success and popularity of cinema in Bosnia, the event has gained considerable importance and often attracts foreign celebrities. The Sarajevo Winter Festival is also well-known, as are the Ba≈°ƒáar≈°ija Nights, a month-long showcase of local culture, music, and dance. The city is also present internationally in various forms of pop culture. The film \\"Welcome to Sarajevo\\" was released in 1997. The Irish rock band U2 had a hit song with Miss Sarajevo, and progressive metal group Savatage's 1995 Concept Album \\"Dead Winter Dead\\" deals with the story of Sarajevo's Romeo and Juliet. Sarajevo is also the name of a jam band from East Windsor, New Jersey.

Life Akroyd-Stuart had lived in Australia in his early years. He was educated at Newbury Grammar School (now St. Bartholomew's School) and Finsbury Technical College in London. He was the son of Charles Stuart, founder of the Bletchley Iron and Tinplate Works, joining his father in the business in 1887. Oil engines In 1885, Akroyd Stuart accidentally spilt paraffin oil (kerosene) into a pot of molten tin. The paraffin oil vaporised and caught fire when in contact with a paraffin lamp. This gave him an idea to pursue the possibility of using paraffin oil (very similar to modern-day diesel) for an engine, which unlike petrol proved difficult to vaporise in a carburettor because its volatility is insufficient. His first prototype engines were built in 1886. In 1890, in collaboration with Charles Richard Binney, he filed Patent 7146 for Richard Hornsby and Sons of Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The patent was entitled: \\"Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air\\". One such engine was sold to Newport Sanitary Authority, but the compression ratio was too low to get it started from cold, and it needed a heat poultice to get it going. Hornsby-Akroyd engine A Hornsby-Akroyd engine working at the Great Dorset Steam Fair Akroyd-Stuart's engines were built from 26 June 1891 by Richard Hornsby and Sons as the Hornsby Akroyd Patent Oil Engine under licence and were first sold commercially on 8 July 1892. It was the first internal combustion engine to use a pressurised fuel injection system. The Hornsby-Akroyd engine used a comparatively low compression ratio, so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion. Combustion instead took place in a separated combustion chamber, the \\"vaporizer\\" (also called the \\"hot bulb\\") mounted on the cylinder head, into which fuel was sprayed. It was connected to the cylinder by a narrow passage and was heated either by the cylinder's coolant or by exhaust gases while running; an external flame such as a blowtorch was used for starting. Self-ignition occurred from contact between the fuel-air mixture and the hot walls of the vaporizer. By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attached to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence was set up as the ignited gases flashed through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion was completed. As the engine's load increased, so did the temperature of the bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water was dripped into the air intake. Hot bulb engines were produced until the late 1920s, often being called \\"semi-diesels\\", even though they were not as efficient as compression ignition engines. They had the advantage of comparative simplicity, since they did not require the air compressor used by early Diesel engines; fuel was injected mechanically (solid injection) near the start of the compression stroke, at a much lower pressure than that of Diesel engines. Oil-engined locomotive Richard Hornsby and Sons built the world's first oil-engined railway locomotive LACHESIS for the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, England, in 1896. They also built the first compression-ignition powered automobile. Oil engines outside the UK ;Sweden Similar engines were built by Bolinder in Sweden and some of these still survive in canal boats. ;United States Hot bulb engines were built in the USA by the De La Vergne Company of New York City, later the New York Refrigerating Company - inventing the modern refrigerator in 1930, who purchased a licence in 1893. Akroyd engine and Diesel engine Plaque in Denmark Street, Fenny Stratford, UK, commemorating the work of Herbert Akroyd Stuart Both the Diesel engine, and the Akroyd engine run the same kind of fuel, petroleum oil, which has led to a dispute about whether or not the Diesel engine is based upon the Akroyd engine.Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, . p. 420 The fact that the Diesel engine's operating principle differs from the operating principle Rudolf Diesel describes in his essay Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor further contributed to this. The Akroyd engine was the first functional internal combustion engine that could use petroleum oil as fuel.Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, . p. 417 It was operational in 1891, six years before the Diesel engine first ran. However, after the Diesel engine had proven successful, \\"Diesel engine\\" became the synonym for an engine that ran on any sort of petroleum oil. \\"Oil engines\\" that used the Akroyd operating principle were called \\"Semi-Diesel\\", and the name \\"Akroyd\\", which had been associated with oil engines, fell out of use. Therefore, Herbert Akroyd Stuart sought to replace the term Diesel engine with Akroyd engine in the early 20th century.Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, . p. 418 Herbert Akroyd Stuart had two patents, No. 7146 Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air, and No. 15994. In the former, the Akroyd engine's operating principle is described as follows: \\"... at the desired part of this compression stroke, the supply of liquid hydrocarbon is forced, in a spray form, on to the heated vaporiser, which almost instantly changes it into a gas...\\". Early Akroyd engines indeed operated on this principle. Rudolf Diesel had a patent on the combustion process described in his essay (DRP 67207). The Diesel engine neither operates on the process described in the Akroyd patent, nor on the process described in the DRP 67207 patent. It operates instead on a different operating principle, also invented by Rudolf Diesel (patented in 1893, DRP 82168), which is why Diesel is in fact the Diesel engine's inventor. However, Diesel never admitted that his engine operated on a \\"secret\\" operating principle, and claimed that the Diesel engine operates on the (impossible) operating process described in the DRP 67207 patent.Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, . p. 517, 518 The key difference between the Akroyd and Diesel engines is the ignition: In an Akroyd engine, an ignition device ‚Äì the so-called \\"hot bulb\\" ‚Äì ignites the fuel, because the compression is too low for compression ignition (<300 kPa). A Diesel engine on the other hand has no discrete ignition devices. The fuel instead ignites due to high heat caused solely by piston compression inside the cylinder (>3000 kPa).Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, . p. 419 Since higher compression leads to better efficiency, the lower-pressure Akroyd engine consumes ~ 80% more fuel than a Diesel engine doing the same work.Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, . p. 416 Death In 1900, he moved to Australia and set up a company Sanders & Stuart with his brother Charles, late in life moving back to Yorkshire, England. He died on 19 February 1927 of throat cancer and was buried in All Souls church in Boothtown, Halifax. The University of Nottingham has hosted the Akroyd-Stuart Memorial Lecture on occasional years in his memory since 1928. One was presented by Sir Frank Whittle in 1946. Akroyd Stuart had worked with Professor William Robinson in the late 19th century, who was professor of engineering from 1890 to 1924 at University College Nottingham. Akroyd-Stuart also left money to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Royal Aeronautical Society and Institute of Marine Engineering, which provided for their respective bi-annual Akroyd-Stuart Prizes.

Early life and military career  Born in the village of Davor in Croatian Military Frontier (today a part of Croatia) as a son of a Military Frontier officer, Relkoviƒá too enlisted in the Austrian army at the age of 16. He fought in the Seven Years' War until he was captured by Prussians in Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau), and spent a few years of rather \\"relaxed\\" imprisonment at Frankfurt (Oder). Relkoviƒá's prison years became his Lehrjahre, his educational period: a voracious but unsystematic reader, he studied many works by leading Enlightenment writers (Voltaire, Bayle, Diderot), as well as Polish poet Jan Kochanowski's didactic epic Satir- which became the model for his most famous work. After the release, Relkoviƒá spent a few more years on war campaigns (this time Bavaria), but eventually sated and bored with military life, he asked and got pension from Austrian emperor Joseph II in the rank of captain, as well as the title of hereditary noble. Having spent the rest of his life as a writer and social reformer, Relkoviƒá died in Vinkovci, Military Frontier.  Bibliography  Considering the deplorable state of Slavonia after the liberation from the Ottomans, Relkoviƒá is, bearing in mind general backwardness of the area, extremely versatile and prolific writer. This Slavonian polymath has left indelible marks on Croatian philology, literature and general culture. Of course, almost all of his works are now only of historical interest (he possessed no authentic literary talent, nor even ambition), but, they have become so integrated in Slavonian general culture that further generations of writers and philologists frequently adopted many Relkoviƒá's idioms and phrases without even being conscious of it. His popular dithyrambic verses on Slavonia are, in a way, the region's motto. Relkoviƒá wrote numerous works, among which the following should be mentioned: * \\"Nova slavonska i nimaƒçka gramatika\\"/New Slavonian and German grammar, published posthumously in 1860s * \\"Nek je sva≈°ta iliti sabranje pametnih riƒçih\\"/Collection of wise adages, 1795, a hybrid polygraphy of aphorisms, mainly in the spirit of Rationalism and didacticism * \\"Satir iliti divji ƒçovik\\"/Satir or savage man, 1762, extended edition 1779, his most famous work, one of the Croatian Enlightenment bestsellers His \\"Satir\\" is a patchwork of didactic poetry, prose, quasi-dramatic dialogues, soaked in common sense wisdom of Enlightenment and consisting mainly of pragmatic counsels on agriculture, small manufacture and, the most amusing part for the contemporary reader -- sexual and behavioral codes of inhabitants of Slavonia which survived the Turkish expulsion and which were, as a sign of \\"Oriental\\" sensualism and dissoluteness, particularly abhorrent to the Rationalist moralist Relkoviƒá. However -- one must not be too severe in criticism of Relkoviƒá's reforming zeal, since the general state of affairs in Slavonia was at so low a level that his outrage was in many ways justified.  Legacy  Relkoviƒá's enduring legacy is, even more than in the content of his didactic epic, contained in his linguistic idiom and grammatical and philological works (which, by the way, his son continued). Having spread the Croatian neo-≈°tokavian idiom in the second half of the 18th century, he is, along with Adam Tadije Blagojeviƒá and Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá, a Dalmatian friar, considered to be one of the most decisive influences that helped shape Serbo- Croatian standard language. Although modern Croatian linguists sometimes squabble about the range and actual value of his opus (some are of the opinion that Croatian owes more to the period of Baroque Slavism in early 17th century (with central authors like Bartol Ka≈°iƒá, Jakov Mikalja and Ivan Gunduliƒá), or to the Croatian writers from Ragusa of the late 15th century/early 16th century- crucial writers being D≈æore Dr≈æiƒá and ≈†i≈°ko Menƒçetiƒá) -- no one denies Relkoviƒá's popular appeal that was, at least, the final touch that helped neo-≈°tokavian dialect to prevail as the basis of the Serbo-Croatian language.

Artists who have performed at Loser's Lounge shows include Paul Williams, J Mascis, Sean Altman, John Flansburgh, April March, Ronnie Spector, Debbie Harry, Alice Cohen, Richard Barone, J. G. Thirlwell, Brian Dewan, Carol Jacobanis, and Cyndi Lauper. History The original revue was created in 1993 and performed by Joe McGinty (former keyboardist for the Psychedelic Furs and session musician for bands like The Ramones) with the performer Nick Danger and the singer/songwriter Andrea Egert. Its first performances were at the Pink Pony, on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side of New York City. Later performances at Fez under Time Cafe were backed by guitarist David Terhune's The Kustard Kings, members of which ‚Äî including Terhune, guitarist Julian Maile, drummer Clem Waldmen, percussionist Eddie Zweiback, and bassist Jeremy Chatzky ‚Äî continue to perform as regulars for the Loser's Lounge with McGinty and regular back-up singers Connie Petruk, Tricia Scotti, Sean Altman, and Katia Floreska. For many years Fez under Time Cafe was home to regular Loser's Lounge performances. The Fez closed as a venue in April, 2005, and since the revue has continued to perform bi-monthly at Joe's Pub. The Loser's Lounge has additionally appeared at several large rooms in New York City, including the Allen Room at AOL Time Warner Center and the Bowery Ballroom, as well as out-of-state venues like MASS MoCA. The group has played at notable New York musical events including Midsummer Night Swing at Lincoln Centerhttp://midsummernightswing.org/index.php/2012-losers-lounge and Celebrate Brooklyn.

As of summer 2006, it was the only airline flying between the Russian Far East and the American state of Alaska. The airline suspended commercial operations in July 2006 with debts of around $18 million. It has not declared bankruptcy. History A large number of Mavial employees are reported to have gone on hunger strike in an attempt to force the regional government to pay wages owed since the first half of 2006. They received no wages since before the suspension of commercial operations in July 2006. Over 20 Mavial pilots began a hunger strike on 25 October 2006 and were later joined by flight attendants, engineers and technicians. The sale of some company assets, including the Magadan Airport terminal, should have raised the necessary funds, but it has not been confirmed that the strike has ended. Aeroflot, which had previously planned to acquire Mavial, has opened its own affiliate company in the region and will employ some of the staff.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 195 Oxford University Press 1996 The name Verdicchio derives from verde (or \\"green\\") and refers to the slight green/yellow hue that wines made from the grape can have.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 54, 190, 241 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Verdicchio is the principal grape behind two Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines produced in the provinces of Macerata and Ancona, Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi. In addition to producing still wines, Verdicchio grapes are also used to make sparkling wine and straw wine.Oz Clarke & M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 272 Webster International Publishers History Verdicchio has had a long history in the Marche region of central Italy with documents noting its presence there since at least the 14th century. Despite its sensitivity to climate conditions and propensity to produce variable yields of variable quality wine, Verdicchio was a very popular planting in central Italy with an estimated 65,000 hectares planted in the mid-1980s. These figures made Verdicchio the 15th most planted variety of any grape in the world, ahead of well-known varieties like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Sangiovese. While ampelographers believe that Verdicchio is probably indigenous to the Marche, there appears to be a genetic relation to Trebbiano and Greco grape varieties. In particular, the clones of Trebbiano grown in Lombardy and Soave show very close similarities to Verdicchio while genetic evidence has shown that Greco was probably an ancestor vine to nearly all of Italy's native white grape varieties.J. Bastianich & D. Lynch Vino Italiano pg 244‚Äì246 Crown Publishing 2005 Wine regions Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi in the classic Anfora bottle, a DOC wine from Marche, Italy. While Verdicchio is widely grown throughout the Marche, Umbria and Lazio regions, it is most often encountered in the DOC wines of Verdicchio di Matelica and Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi. Castelli di Jesi, located around the commune of Jesi in the Ancona province, is the larger of the two areas and tends to produce a higher volume of wine. In Matelica, located in the nearby province of Macerata, the yields for Verdicchio are more restricted under DOC regulation with the best vineyard locations situated along hillsides of the Esino valley. DOC regions Verdicchio vines growing in Cupramontana (AN). Verdicchio vines growing in Montecarotto (AN). The following is a list of DOCs that include Verdicchio as a permitted grape variety, along with other grapes that may be included in the blend in varying percentages that are regulated under the DOC label. The wines for which Verdicchio must account for a majority of the blend are in bold.P.

In addition to a still version both a sparkling spumante and sweet passito style are produced in the DOC from Verdicchio. *Verdicchio di Matelica DOC (Marche) -A minimum of 85% Verdicchio with Trebbiano and Malvasia permitted to fill in the remaining portions of wine. In addition to a still version a spumante and a passito style are produced in the DOC from Verdicchio. Wine styles Verdicchio vines in late October nearing harvest Verdicchio can produce wines that are virtually colorless with noticeably high acidity that can come across on the palate with citrus notes. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, well made examples from favorable vintages can have flavors of lemons and slight bitter almond notes. Robinson also notes that the naturally high acidity of the grape makes it a good base cuvee variety for producing sparkling wine. According to Oz Clarke, the quality of Verdicchio wines has improved since the later half of the 20th century as producers limit yields even beyond DOC regulation to produce fuller flavored grapes that can better balance its high acidity. Clarke goes on to note that the subtlety of Verdicchio flavors allows it to pair very well with a variety of foods. Clonal variation and plantings Verdicchio shares several synonyms with Trebbiano (pictured) and the two varieties can sometimes be confused for each other. The Verdicchio grapevine is very susceptible to clonal mutations with several sub-varieties of the grape known to exist in central Italy under various synonyms (see section below). Like with many varieties of Italian wine grapes, this makes an exact cataloging of the number of plantings difficult. In her book, Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes, Robinson reports in 1996 that there were nearly of Verdicchio found mostly in the provinces along the Adriatic coast. That number is dramatically reduced from the number of plantings of Verdicchio in the mid-1980s when there was an estimated 65,000 hectares (all in Italy). However, some wine experts, including Jancis Robinson, speculate that it is likely that some of those plantings were actually Trebbiano. Synonyms Over the years Verdicchio and its wines have been known under various synonyms including Boschera bianca, Giallo, Maceratese, Maggiore, Marchigiano, Mazzanico, Niuivres, Peloso, Peverella, Peverello, Peverenda, Peverise bianco, Pfeffer, Pfeffertraube, Terbiana, Torbiana, Trebbiano di Lugana, Trebbiano di Soave, Trebbiano verde, Trebbiano Veronese, Turbiana, Turbiana Moscato, Turbiano, Turviana, Uva Aminea, Uva Marana, Verdello duro persico, Verdicchio bianco, Verdicchio Dolce, Verdicchio Doratel, Verdicchio Doratello, Verdicchio Giallo, Verdicchio Marchigiano, Verdicchio Marino, Verdicchio Peloso, Verdicchio Scroccarello, Verdicchio Seroccarello, Verdicchio Straccione, Verdicchio Stretto, Verdicchio Verdaro, Verdicchio verde, Verdicchio Verzaro, Verdicchio Verzello, Verdone, Verzaro and Verzello verde.Verdicchio Bianco, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, Accessed: September 23, 2017 See also *List of Italian grape varieties References Category:White wine grape varieties Category:Wine grapes of Italy ","title":"Verdicchio"},{"id":"1118645","text":"Little Computer People, also called House-on-a-Disk, is a life simulation game released in 1985 by Activision for the Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Apple II. An Amiga version was released in 1987. Two Japanese versions were also released in 1987, a Family Computer Disk System version, published in Japan by DOG (a subsidiary of Square), and a PC-8801 version. Gameplay The game has no winning conditions, and one setting: a sideways view of the inside of a three-story house.https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/little-computer-people/ After a short time, an animated character will move in and occupy the house. He goes about a daily routine, doing everyday things like cooking, watching television or reading the newspaper. Players are able to interact with this person in various ways, including entering simple commands for the character to perform, playing a game of poker with him and offering presents. On occasion, the character initiates contact on his own, inviting the player to a game or writing a letter explaining his feelings and needs. Each copy of the game generates its own unique character, so no two copies play exactly the same. The character's name is randomly selected from a list of 256 names. 4AM's list of Little Computer People names The documentation that accompanied the game fully kept up the pretense of the \\"little people\\" being real, and living inside one's computer (the software merely \\"bringing them out\\"), with the player as their caretaker. Two versions of the game existed for the Commodore 64: the disk version, which played as described above, and the cassette version, which omitted several features.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/little-computer-people-review On tape versions, the Little Computer Person was generated from scratch every time the game was started up (not only on the first boot, as with other versions), and thus did not go through the \\"moving in\\" sequence seen on other versions. Also, on cassette versions the Computer Person had no memory, and did not communicate meaningfully with the user; and the card games, such as poker, could not be played. Copy protection In pirated copies of the game on the Atari ST (and possibly other platforms) the game would load, but the character would simply stand knocking on the screen and wagging a finger at the player disapprovingly. Add-ons According to \\"High Score!\\", add- ons were planned, such as diskettes filled with new furniture and an \\"LCP Apartment\\" in an apartment building, with the LCPs all interacting. These add- ons, also described in terms of a sequel expanding on the LCP concept, never materialized.  Reception  Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"The game is more cute than fun or challenging. The range of activities are limited and not very exciting, but can be interesting. The \\"game\\" is ideally suited for children. It does a good job of teaching about caring for another.\\" Little Computer People earned a Zzap!64 Gold Medal Award in 1985. Jerry Pournelle of BYTE named it his game of the month for December 1986, stating \\"That's not strictly a game, but it sure has consumed all the game time we have around here\\" and that the Amiga version's graphics were preferable to the Atari ST's. Compute! favorably reviewed the Atari ST version in 1987, stating that it had \\"enormous and subtle educational appeal\\" to children and others. The magazine concluded that Little Computer People \\"is a delightful program\\". The game was voted best original game of the year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards. Japanese versions Apple Town Story is a port of Little Computer People to the Family Computer Disk System. The port was released by Square of Final Fantasy fame in 1987. Unlike previous versions of Little Computer People, the playable character is a girl wearing a pink dress and bow in her hair. The rooms of the house are also in a different configuration, featuring an outdoor balcony on the top floor. When the game is first played, a name for the character is chosen at random from a preprogrammed list. Apple Town Story lacks many of the features found in other versions of Little Computer People. The game's soundtrack was written by Nobuo Uematsu, who would later become recognized for his work in the Final Fantasy series. PC-8801 version In December 1987, a second Japanese version of the game was released for the PC-8801 computer, titled Little Computer People („É™„Éà„É´„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº„Çø„Éî„Éº„Éó„É´). Like Apple Town Story, this game also features a female character, only older and more glamorous in appearance. Aside from the character, this version of the game is far more like the original in all other respects. Legacy Will Wright, designer of The Sims, has mentioned playing Little Computer People and receiving valuable feedback on The Sims from its designer, Rich Gold.

In 2003 Data Design was finally acquired by the Hungarian Interactive Net Design (IND).Datadesign Stuttgart bought by Hungary's IND (telecom paper) Technology Brokat developed mostly banking-related software and provided professional services mainly to financial institutions. Brokat was known for its encryption server and applet technology named XPresso, which made strong encryption (128bit symmetric) available without US (especially NSA) interference. Brokat sold its software to many large financial institutions mainly in Europe, especially Germany. In addition to providing systems to established institutions, Brokat also created solutions for startup companies. A prominent example for the latter is Cortal Consors. The company tried to get in the middleware software business by developing the application server Twister. Twister was the base technology for nearly all customized solutions implemented by Brokat. Twister Twister was the main product of Brokat AG. It was a proprietary middleware software that was created in the late 1990s and was always sold as the central software product in all projects. The software was mainly sold to financial institutions which often also relied on the XPresso encryption software of Brokat. The base of Twister was a CORBA Object Request Broker written in C++ that handled requests from so-called Gateways and routed them to so-called RDOs. RDOs are comparable to the more modern EJB JavaBeans (server software objects). Backend systems such as legacy mainframe applications or database servers were accessed through so-called \\"Accessors\\". RDOs could be written in TCL, Java or C++ and interact with each other regardless of the language. Despite this cross-language functionality, most projects were implemented in a single language, most often TCL or java. Twister 4 also supported the EJB java object model. Twister was capable of handling very high loads and was thus used by electronic stock traders like Cortal Consors for real-time trading. During the morning hours when the stock exchange opened, the Twister System at Consors was known to handle several thousand connections/requests simultaneously. Innovations Brokat was a pioneer in encryption technology by providing a java-Applet-based encryption toolkit, named Xpresso. The protocol of this toolkit was named SRT (Secure Request Technology). Technically, it was a 128bit-key implementation of the SSL protocol. In the final years, Brokat refocused on Mobile Commerce, which is defined as electronic commerce done on mobile devices such as Smartphones. This led to a technology called Mobile Digital Signature, an XML-based message format for encoding and signing business contracts. For the implementation of business logic, the company devised a very simple object model, called RDO (repository defined object). RDOs had a very simple interface structure, consisting of a flat key-value structure. RDOs could be written in many programming languages and would interoperate easily. Brokat was awarded several patents on encryption technology (e.g. random number generators) and for the RDO cross- language programming model.

The study of sports science traditionally incorporates areas of physiology (exercise physiology), psychology (sport psychology), anatomy, biomechanics, biochemistry, and biokinetics. Sports scientists and performance consultants are growing in demand and employment numbers, with the ever- increasing focus within the sporting world on achieving the best results possible. Through the scientific study of sport, researchers have developed a greater understanding on how the human body reacts to exercise, training, different environments and many other stimuli.  Origins of exercise physiology  Sports science can trace its origins to ancient Greece. The noted ancient Greek physician Galen (131‚Äì201) wrote 87 detailed essays about improving health (proper nutrition), aerobic fitness, and strengthening muscles. New ideas upon the working and functioning of the human body emerged during the Renaissance as anatomists and physicians challenged the previously known theories. These spread with the implementation of the printed word, the result of Gutenberg's printing press in the 15th century. Allied with this was a large increase in academia in general, universities were forming all around the world. Importantly these new scholars went beyond the simplistic notions of the early Greek physicians, and shed light upon the complexities of the circulatory, and digestive systems. Furthermore, by the middle of the 19th century, early medical schools (such as the Harvard Medical School, formed 1782) began appearing in the United States, whose graduates went on to assume positions of importance in academia and allied medical research. Medical journal publications increased significantly in number during this period. In 1898, three articles on physical activity appeared in the first volume of the American Journal of Physiology. Other articles and reviews subsequently appeared in prestigious journals. The German applied physiology publication, Internationale Zeitschrift fur Physiologie einschliesslich Arbeitphysiologie (1929‚Äì1940; now known as the European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology), became a significant journal in the field of research. A number of key figures have made significant contributions to the study of sports science: * Austin Flint, Jr., (1836‚Äì1915) One of the first American pioneer physicians, studied physiological responses to exercise in his influential medical textbooks. * Edward Hitchcock, Jr., (1828‚Äì1911) Amherst College Professor of Hygiene and Physical Education, devoted his academic career to the scientific study of physical exercise, training and the body. Coauthored 1860 text on exercise physiology. * George Wells Fitz, M.D. (1860‚Äì1934) Created the first departmental major in Anatomy, Physiology, and Physical Training at Harvard University in 1891. * August Krogh (1874‚Äì1949) Won the 1920 Nobel prize in physiology for discovering the mechanism that controlled capillary blood flow in resting or active muscle. * Per-Olof √Östrand (1922‚Äì2015) Professor at the Department of Physiology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Wrote a seminal paper which evaluated the physical working capacity of men and women aged 4‚Äì33 years.  Study of sports science  Higher-education degrees in Sports Science or Human Physiology are also becoming increasingly popular with many universities now offering both undergraduate, postgraduate and distance learning degrees in the discipline. Opportunities for graduates in these fields include employment as a Physical Education teacher, Dietician or Nutritionist, Performance Analyst, Sports coach, Sports therapist, Fitness center manager, Sports administrator, Strength and Conditioning specialist or retail manager of a Sports store. Graduates may also be well-positioned to undertake further training to become an accredited Physiotherapist, Exercise Physiologist, Research Scientist and Sports Medical Doctor.

The purpose of JSA is to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants. JSA is sponsored by the Junior State of America Foundation Inc. (JSAF, a 501c(3) non- profit corporation), which also operates the JSA Summer Schools. The Junior State of America is student-run, the largest such organization in the United States.  Overview  Students organize every aspect of the organization, from the local chapter level to the regional level. The members elect local, regional, and state leaders to organize JSA conventions, conferences, and political awareness events. JSA is both a local and a national organization. JSA is organized by regions, somewhat congruous with the real geographic United States regions. At the high school chapter level, chapter presidents organize local activities and meetings. On the regional level, mayors and vice mayors organize regional one-day conferences. On the state level, governors and lieutenant governors organize overnight conventions and other activities. On the national level, governors are in communication with each other planning convention themes and steering the direction of the organization. The JSA program includes debates, \\"thought talks,\\" problem solving, and a variety of simulations designed to provide members with an informed viewpoint and the ability to analyse important issues. Simulations include, for example, Model United Nations, Model Congress (with a Senate and House of Representatives), crisis simulations, and other activities. JSA provides an opportunity to meet other students from outside their home communities who share similar interests; furthermore, debate conventions usually include various evening activities like dining downtown or impromptu debate. In addition to sponsoring the JSA, the JSF sponsors three- and four-week Summer School sessions for JSA members and other high school students. These are held at Stanford and Georgetown, and week-long symposium on state and local politics are held in several states.Ward, William J., New Jersey Eminent Domain Law Blog, Aug. 15, 2007, \\"Junior Statesmen hear eminent domain talk,\\" http://www.njeminentdomain.com/state-of-new-jersey-junior-statesmen-hear- eminent-domain-talk.html (In years past, JSF has held Summer School sessions at Yale, Northwestern University, University of Texas at Austin, University of California, Davis, University of California, Santa Cruz, and Princeton).

For example, throughout the 1980s the Pacific-Northwest State developed close ties with the British Columbia Youth Parliament (BCYP). \\"Ambassadors\\" were invited from the Pacific-Northwest State to attend the December BCYP legislative session in Victoria, British Columbia, as well a number of BCYP sponsored events, including the \\"Vernon Conference\\" held in 1985, a project to celebrate the United Nations International Year of the Youth, involving the BCYP, the TUXIS Parliament of Alberta, and the JSA. In turn, the BCYP would send delegates to attend Pacific-Northwest Spring and Fall State. The Southern California state also added the American School in Honduras as a chapter in 2006 and the school's chapter attended the annual Congress convention. There are two active chapters in St. Kitts and St. Thomas, USVI. Puerto Rico has traditionally one or two chapters. All Caribbean chapters attend either the Northeast State or Mid-Atlantic State conventions. Since its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have participated in the JSA.  Notable alumni  Notable former members include Leon Panetta (Former Secretary of Defense, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, White House Chief of Staff, United States Congressman, and Member of the California State Senate), Mike McCurry (Press Secretary under President Bill Clinton), Edwin Meese (Attorney General under President Ronald Reagan), Jennifer Palmieri (White House Communication Director under President Barack Obama) businessman and inventor Charles R. Schwab, and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. There are also 3 current JSA alumni serving in Congress: Mark Takano, Derek Kilmer, and Zoe Lofgren.

Each state is broken into one or more regions. If a state contracts below a certain operational level, the Council of Governors may vote to make the state a territory. The Council may also break states into multiple territories if they become too large to be effectively managed. The sponsoring JSAF is a non-profit organization with an adult board of directors, trustees and paid staff. The JSA receives administrative and programming support from the JSF.

JSA events   Fall and Spring State conventions  Fall State and Spring State are statewide overnight conventions at regional hotels and convention centers. Both consist of debates, thought talks, and special activities, including political fairs and a casual dance. Fall State is one night, students typically arrive at the hotel on a Saturday and return home the following day. Spring State, by comparison, usually takes place over three days, students arriving at the hotel on a Friday and returning on Sunday. At this longer spring convention JSA members in attendance elect regional leaders for the upcoming year. Both Fall and Spring State conventions are highlighted by prestigious keynote speakers, with past speakers including Pat Robertson, Ralph Nader, Colin Powell, Jahana Hayes, Tom Malinowski, Fareed Zakaria and Joe Trippi.  Winter Congress convention  Winter Congress is structured similar to the United States Congress: students are divided into Senate and House of Representative committees. Student delegates pass bills in committees and then in floor sessions of the Senate and House. If a bill passes both houses, it becomes JSA law.  Regional conferences  There are also smaller, regional conferences and chapter-conferences (\\"chapter-cons\\") which occur on a local level. Regionals are run by the Mayors and Vice-Mayors of Regions along with the Regional Cabinet members that they appoint. Chapter- cons are usually hosted by chapters at individual schools and are not officially JSA-sponsored events.  Elected positions and cabinet  As a student-run organization, each JSA state holds elections yearly at the Spring State conventions to elect student elected officials who serve one-year terms. Each state elects a Governor and Lieutenant Governor, as well as various other offices that differ from state to state. These officials each appoint a small cabinet that helps them run the organization by completing tasks such as organizing convention logistics, writing debates, producing publicity materials, founding new chapters, and running websites. There is also a National Cabinet appointed by the Council of Governors. JSA officials and cabinet members are typically extremely dedicated to JSA, and often spend many hours per week doing their jobs.  Summer programs  After the school year is over, JSA and JSF offer numerous summer programs. The biggest programs, which are held at major universities, are Summer Schools, which are conducted by the Junior Statesmen Foundation and offer students an opportunity to study local, state, or national government at an advanced level. These programs are meant to prepare young leaders for active participation in public affairs. These programs, at which students take a full semester of two courses over three or four weeks, for which they can receive high school credit, take place at Stanford, Georgetown, Princeton, and Beijing. Along with debate and regular classes (including Advanced Placement and Law Classes), students participate in a vigorous Speaker's Program in which notable speakers talk about current issues to the students. Past speakers have included Mike McCurry, Andy Card, Ben Bernanke, Lee H. Hamilton, Norman Mineta, Joe Trippi, Dennis Kucinich, Chuck Hagel, Katie Couric, Brian Williams, Geraldine Ferraro, John Kerry, Harry Reid, Barack Obama, Ted Rall, George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Ed Meese, William Perry, Bernie Sanders, Brian Williams, Karl Rove, Sebastian Gorka, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Summer institutes are also held in different regions, such as the summer symposium of Arizona State, Stanford, UCLA, Princeton University and University of Texas. These events are four- to five-days long and venture into politics, world studies, history, national security and discussions of current events. Princeton's event is nicknamed \\"Princetitute.\\" These events used to be known as symposia. Every summer, the newly elected governors each choose a select few from their states or territories to attend the Montezuma National Leadership Summit (affectionately known as \\"Zuma\\"). The summit is held in early-to-mid August at Presentation Center in Los Gatos, California, the former site of the Montezuma Mountain School where JSA was founded in 1934. Students who are selected to attend this summit learn more about the history and national dynamics of JSA. Being selected for attendance is considered one of the ultimate JSA honors, and many of the students that attend lead future years of the Junior State. Subsequently, two or three students are selected out of class to become a National Montezuma Foundation Student Advisor, working with the Junior State Foundation to preside over budget and funding allocations for the National Montezuma Summit.

Through various actions, the Yes Men primarily aim to raise awareness about problematic social and political issues. To date, the duo have produced three films: The Yes Men (2003), The Yes Men Fix the World (2009), and The Yes Men Are Revolting (2014). In these films, they impersonate entities that they dislike, a practice that they call \\"identity correction\\". The Yes Men operate under the mission statement that lies can expose truth. They create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have led to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations. They espouse the belief that corporations and governmental organizations often act in dehumanizing ways toward the public. Elaborate props are sometimes part of the ruse (e.g. Survivaball), as shown in their 2003 DVD release The Yes Men. The Yes Men have collaborated with other groups of similar interest, including Improv Everywhere, Andrew Boyd and Steve Lambert.  Background  According to Servin, the Yes Men concept initially sprang from their creation of a fake website spoofing the World Trade Organization. To the surprise of Servin and Vamos, many believed the site to be authentic, and the two were consequently contacted to speak at a conference in Austria. Since this time, the Yes Men have continued performing large-scale hoaxes, in what they describe as a collaborative effort with journalists to help the media tell stories which they believe are important. The Yes Men often deploy a satirical approach: they pose as a powerful entity (typically a corporate or government representative or executive) and make ridiculous and shocking comments that caricature the ideological position of the organisation or person. Furthermore, they acknowledge the idea that many corporate or government entities manipulate their ideology using spin; in response, the Yes Men use this power of spin to their own advantage, and use media outlets to disseminate their personal interpretation of the situation. A sense of humor and shock value is usually employed to make these issues more palatable to the general public and to call greater media attention to stories of interest. Some of these outrageous ideas include the prospect of selling one's vote or a proposition that the poor should consume recycled human waste. On most occasions, little to no shock or outrage is publicly evoked in response to their prank. On occasion, the Yes Men's phony spokesperson will make announcements that represent fictitious scenarios for the anti-globalization movement or opponents of corporate crime. This has often resulted in false news reports, such as those covering the demise of the World Trade Organization, or Dow Chemical paying compensation to the victims of the Bhopal disaster. The Yes Men have posed as spokespeople for the WTO, McDonald's, Dow Chemical, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The two leading members of the Yes Men are known by a number of aliases, most recently, and in film, Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno (Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, respectively). Servin is an author of experimental fiction, and was known for being the man who inserted images of men kissing in the computer game SimCopter. Vamos is an associate professor of media arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. They are assisted by numerous people across the globe. There are other full-time members, such as Whitney Black and Rocco Ferrer, who take a more behind-the-scenes approach. Their experiences were documented in the film The Yes Men,The Yes Men (2003) IMDB.com distributed by United Artists, the film documentary info wars, and the book The Yes Men: The True Story of the End of the World Trade Organization (). Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno also directed a 2009 film entitled The Yes Men Fix the World, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2009 they launched their online video channel on Babelgum. Their third film, The Yes Men Are Revolting, premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The Yes Men encourage activist and student groups to make their voices heard through crashing conferences, creating fake websites, and getting arrested.  Projects   George W. Bush  One of the Yes Men's first pranks was the satirical website \`gwbush.com\`, established for the 2000 US presidential election to draw attention to alleged hypocrisies on Bush's actual website. When asked about the site in a press conference on May 21, 1999, Bush responded that the website had gone too far in criticizing him. In 2004, the Yes Men went on tour posing as the group \\"Yes, Bush Can!\\" and encouraged supporters to sign a \\"Patriot Pledge\\" agreeing to keep nuclear waste in their back yards and send their children off to war. They appeared at the 2004 Republican National Convention and drove across the country at first in an RV with a George W. Bush body wrap, and then in a painted van.  Ice Age Petition  The Yes Men posed as working as part of the Bush-Cheney campaign. They carried around a petition asking for signatures to support global warming because America's competing countries will suffer while America only bears minor side effects.  Dow Chemical  On December 3, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, Andy Bichlbaum appeared on BBC World as \\"Jude Finisterra\\", a Dow Chemical spokesman. Dow is the owner of Union Carbide, the company responsible for the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India on December 3, 1984. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately from the hazardous chemicals and thousands more were killed by the plume from the UCC plant during the next few days. The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas, leading to numerous early and late health defects. The Bhopal Disaster became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe. Immediately after the disaster, UCC began attempts to dissociate itself from responsibility for the gas leak. The Indian Supreme Court eventually mediated a settlement in which UCC accepted moral responsibility and agreed to pay $470 million to the Indian government to be distributed to claimants as a full and final settlement. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200.Warren M. Anderson, who lead the Union Carbide during the Bhopal disaster of 1984, died in 2014 at the age of 92 after fleeing to the United States; his wife, Lillian, stated Anderson suffered \\"25 years of unfair treatment.\\" On their fake Dow Chemical website, the Yes Men said that Dow Chemical Company had no intention whatsoever of repairing the damage. The real company received considerable backlash, and both the real Dow and the phony Dow denied the statements, but Dow took no real action. The Yes Men decided to pressure Dow further, so as \\"Finisterra,\\" Bichlbaum went on the news to claim that Dow planned to liquidate Union Carbide and use the resulting $12 billion to pay for medical care, clean up the site, and fund research into the hazards of other Dow products. After two hours of wide coverage, Dow issued a press release denying the statement, ensuring even greater coverage of the phony news of a cleanup. In Frankfurt, Dow's share price fell 4.24 percent in 23 minutes, wiping $2 billion off its market value. The shares rebounded in Frankfurt after the BBC issued an on-air correction and apology. In New York, Dow Chemical's stock were little changed because of the early trading. After the original interview was revealed as a hoax, Bichlbaum appeared in a follow- up interview on the United Kingdom's Channel 4 news. During the interview he was asked if he had considered the emotions and reaction of the people of Bhopal when producing the hoax. According to the interviewer, \\"there were many people in tears\\" upon having learned of the hoax. Bichlbaum said that, in comparison, what distress he had caused the people was minimal to that for which Dow was responsible. The Yes Men claim on their website that they have been told by contacts in Bhopal that once they had got over their disappointment that it wasn't real, they were pleased about the stunt and thought it had helped to raise awareness of their plight. At the International Payments Conference on April 28, 2005, 'Dow representative' \\"Erastus Hamm\\" unveiled Acceptable Risk, the Acceptable Risk Calculator, and the Acceptable Risk mascot ‚Äî a life-sized golden skeleton named Gilda ‚Äî to an audience of about 70 banking professionals. In February 2012, it was widely reported in the 2012 Stratfor email leak that Dow Chemical Company hired private intelligence firm Stratfor to monitor the Yes Men.  WTO  One of the Yes Men's most famous pranks is placing a \\"corrected\\" WTO website at http://www.gatt.org (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The fake site began to receive real emails from confused visitors, including invitations to address various elite groups on behalf of the WTO, to which they responded as if they were the actual WTO. At the WTO, the Yes Men gave speeches encouraging corporations to buy votes directly from citizens. They then unveiled a gold spandex body suit that they said would allow productivity to increase, as managers would not have to oversee workers in person but could keep track of them via images on an attached screen as well as implanted sensors.  New Orleans and HUD  The Yes Men appeared on August 28, 2006 at a \\"Housing Summit\\" in New Orleans, taking the stage along with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. Before an audience composed mostly of real estate developers, one of the Yes Men gave a speech in which he claimed to be Rene Oswin, a fictitious \\"assistant under-secretary\\" at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In his speech he claimed that HUD would reopen public housing facilities that had been closed since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. He announced this false claim because HUD had recently decided to only rebuild a third of the subsidized housing stock after hurricane Katrina, and made plans to demolish four of New Orleans‚Äô ten public housing developments, leaving thousands of New Orleans residents without homes. This decision was contested locally, nationally, and internationally. So, the Yes Men proclaimed that HUD had changed its mind about tearing down the undamaged housing units, and would not tear down the housing projects, as they had planned to do in order to replace them with mixed-income developments. HUD called this prank, which was intended to bring attention to the lack of affordable housing, a \\"cruel hoax\\". A former resident of the community was quoted by Bichlbaum as saying, \\"do whatever's most effective, do it, don't worry about how it affects us,\\" however. HUD spokeswoman Donna White said no one named \\"Rene Oswin\\" works for the department. White commented, \\"I'm like, who the heck is that?\\" The fictitious Oswin also announced that the big oil companies would contribute some of their record profits to rebuild the wetlands destroyed by the construction of oil tanker canals to prevent the city from being inundated by future hurricanes.  ExxonMobil  Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno pose as ExxonMobil executives. On June 14, 2007, the Yes Men acted during Canada's largest oil conference in Calgary, Alberta, posing as ExxonMobil and National Petroleum Council (NPC) representatives. In front of more than 300 oilmen, the NPC was expected to deliver the long-awaited conclusions of a study commissioned by U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman. The NPC is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond, who is also the chair of the study. When the Yes Men arrived at the conference they said that Lee Raymond (the promised speaker) was unable to make it due to a pressing situation with the president. The Yes Men then went on to give a presentation in place of Lee Raymond. In the actual speech, the \\"NPC rep\\" announced that current U.S. and Canadian energy policies (notably the massive, carbon-intensive processing of Alberta's oil sands, and the development of liquid coal) are increasing the chances of huge global calamities. But he reassured the audience that in the worst-case scenario, the oil industry could \\"keep fuel flowing\\" by transforming the billions of people who would die into oil. The project, called Vivoleum, would work in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of fossil fuel production. The oilmen listened to the lecture with attention, and then lit \\"commemorative candles\\". At this point, event security recognized the Yes Men and forced them off stage, and the 'punchline' ‚Äî that the candles were made of Vivoleum obtained from the flesh of an \\"Exxon janitor\\" who died as a result of cleaning up a toxic spill ‚Äî was not delivered to the audience, but only to reporters.  Milton Friedman documentary  In July 2007, in order to obtain interviews with right wing think tanks, the Yes Men pretended to be filming a documentary about Milton Friedman. (In fact, their documentary, The Yes Men Fix the World, did end up speaking about Friedman at length.) After interviewing members of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the American Enterprise Institute, several of whom appear in the film, the Yes Men were foiled at the Cato Institute by libertarian activists Bureaucrash, one of whose members had been hanging around the Competitive Enterprise Institute two days before and recognized the duo. On their way out, Bureaucrash members threw colored powder at the Yes Men in a reference to the rainbow.  BP  On March 10, 2008, the Yes Men responded to a letter from BP (merged from British Petroleum and Amoco) accusing them of copyright violation, with a letter apologizing for having forgotten BP with the spoof site half-completed and that \\"BP does every bit as much damage to this planet as does Exxon, Halliburton, or any other more obviously nefarious company\\" and deserves its own properly completed spoof site.  Captain Euro  In 1999, the Yes Men visited the offices of Twelve Star Communications, creators of the Eurofederalist superhero Captain Euro, \\"a comic book character designed to promote European unification with young children.\\" Inside, the impostors discover the hidden, dark truth about European Unification.  New York Times  The Yes Men (along with the Anti- Advertising Agency) also claimed partial responsibility for a prank on November 12, 2008, where approximately 80,000 copies of a fake edition of the July 4, 2009 edition of The New York Times were handed out on the streets of New York and Los Angeles. The fake edition shows their ideas for a better future with headlines such as Iraq War Ends and Nation Sets Its Sights on Building Sane Economy. The front page contained a spoofed motto, \\"All the News We Hope to Print\\" from the famous phrase \\"All the news that's fit to print\\". Articles in the paper announce dozens of new initiatives, including an establishment of national health care, a maximum wage for C.E.O.s and an article wherein George W. Bush accuses himself of treason for his actions during his years as president.Spoofed NYT newspaper There is also a Reuters photo of the fake cover page and a fake website, http://www.nytimes-se.com/. Alex S. Jones, a former Times reporter and media scholar, said of the paper, \\"I would say if you‚Äôve got one, hold on to it...it will probably be a collector‚Äôs item. I‚Äôm just glad someone thinks The New York Times print edition is worthy of an elaborate hoax. A Web spoof would have been infinitely easier. But creating a print newspaper and handing it out at subway stations? That takes a lot of effort.\\"  New York Post and SurvivaBall  On September 21, 2009, one day before a UN summit lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, over 2,000 volunteers distributed throughout New York City a 32-page \\"special edition\\" New York Post, blaring headlines (cover story \\"We're Screwed\\") that the city could face deadly heat waves, extreme flooding, and other lethal effects of global warming within the next few decades. The paper had been created by the Yes Men and a coalition of activists as a wake-up call to action on climate change. Other articles describe the Pentagon's alarmed response to global warming, the U.S. government's minuscule response, China's advanced alternative energy program, and how the COP15 in Copenhagen could be a \\"Flopenhagen\\".\\"SPECIAL EDITION\\" NEW YORK POST by the Yes Men There is also a fake website.http://nypost-se.com/ \\"WE'RE SCREWED\\" climate change special edition New York Post online edition September 21, 2009 A \\"climate change horoscope\\" satire on the Sally Brompton horoscope in the Post was commissioned from an environmental activist horoscope writer but was not published. On September 22, 2009 the Yes Men demonstrated on the alleged behalf of Halliburton and dozens of other climate threatening corporations an inflatable ball-shaped costume known as the SurvivaBall, claiming it was a self-contained living system for surviving disasters caused by global warming. Over two dozen people wore the SurvivaBall costumes as it was demonstrated in the East River. Police shut down the demonstration for lack of a permit. Co-founder of the Yes Men, Andy Bichlbaum, was arrested on an outstanding parking ticket charge and a handful of other Yes Men were served with summons and tickets for disorderly behavior and creating hazardous conditions. The SurvivaBall was also used in a protest at the steps of the capitol. The protesting balls demanded action be taken on global warming to achieve the 350.org goal. Their strategy was to block the entrance until the government comes to a binding agreement on climate change.Survivaball from TheYesMen.org, retrieved 12 May 2015  US Chamber of Commerce  On October 19, 2009, the Yes Men spoofed the United States Chamber of Commerce, declaring a U-turn on their climate change policy. The Yes Men were not able to complete the conference without being exposed as a hoax, although their message that the United States Chamber of Commerce needs to reevaluate their direction in terms of clean energy was their primary concern and was received. Major TV and news organisations carried this story briefly before the hoax was uncovered. The US Chamber of Commerce two weeks later did change their official policy though, according to Al Gore it was \\"not because of\\" the Yes Men's stunt. The Chamber launched a trademark and copyright infringement lawsuit against The Yes Men, who were defended by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The suit was dropped in June 2013. This action appears in their film, The Yes Men Are Revolting.  Canadian environment minister  During the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, the Yes Men put out a statement in which they purported to be the Canadian environment minister, Jim Prentice. The statement pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. The statement was followed by a response from the Ugandan delegation, praising the statement, that was also faked. Another fake statement was then put out blasting the falsehoods of the original fake statement. A fake story in a European edition of the Wall Street Journal was also posted online. Jim Prentice described the hoax as \\"undesirable\\".  Niger Delta Hoax  On March 28, 2010, a video was released on YouTube with the title \\"Shell: We are sorry\\". A man called Bradford Houppe, from the Ethical Affairs Committee at Royal Dutch Shell gave a four-minute-long apology to the people of the Niger Delta for ruining their land, water, and communities. This video was created in response to the numerous environmental problems and human rights violations that have occurred in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria since Shell began oil exploration in the region decades ago. Shell has yet to make any official statement about this video.  GE Tax Refund Hoax reported by the AP  On April 13, 2011, a hoax website with a URL similar to that of the GE press domain (genewscenter.com) designed to look like the GE news center website. The hoax site posted the claim \\"GE Responds to Public Outcry ‚Äì Will Donate Entire $3.2 Billion Tax Refund to Help Offset Cuts and Save American Jobs.\\" and it seems that the AP reported the story as fact, as reported by Good.  Shell Oil and ArcticReady.com  In June 2012, the Yes Men collaborated with Greenpeace and members of the Occupy Seattle movement to create ArcticReady.com, a parody website criticizing Shell Oil's drilling activities in the arctic circle. The website launch was commemorated by a fake launch party held in the Seattle Space Needle. Shell Oil disavowed any affiliation with the website or the launch party on June 14, 2012.  The Action Switchboard  The Action Switchboard is a platform the Yes Men launched to link up people who want to be involved in activism events with people organising them. As it says \\"The Action Switchboard is a platform that helps activists find each other, come up with direct action ideas, and get the resources they need to pull them off.\\"  Edward Snowden Politicon interview  In October 2015, at the annual Politicon non-partisan political convention, the Yes Men promoted an interview with whistleblower Edward Snowden, known to be living in exile in Russia. As they introduced the interview, they announced that Snowden had been pardoned and would join the group in person. As Snowden appeared before them, people cheered, applauded and many rushed the stage for photos. A short time later, another Edward Snowden appeared on the giant screen; however, this time, it was the real Edward Snowden from Russia.  Politicon: new DNC platform  In July 2017, The Yes Men pranked the Democratic Party at Politicon. Following up the \\"Better Deal\\" agenda released by the party a week earlier, prankster Andy Bichlbaum posed as Frank Spencer, Deputy Vice Chair for Civic Engagement of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). As part of the new #DNCTakeBack campaign, Spencer pushed a more ambitious and progressive Democratic agenda, including: Medicare for all, tuition-free college, public campaign financing, stronger unions, an end to corporate lobbying and the end of for-profit prisons.  VW/Dieselgate apology  In November 2018, Motherboard/Vice released a video about The Yes Men and their fake VW \\"Emissions Anonymous\\" project. In the prank, they apologize to the public for the Dieselgate emissions scandal, in which several models and years of VW car family diesel autos were engineered and built with a rigged emissions system that ran clean only while under test conditions, but otherwise released high levels of air pollutants. The Houston Chronicle even covered the pranksters' April 2018 entry in Houston's annual Art Car Parade as if an official VW PR campaign: \\"The marketing department has even turned the crisis into a publicity shtick\\". Fake Washington Post edition On January 16, 2019, parody editions of the Washington Post were distributed in Washington, D.C.. Dated May 1, 2019, the edition's headline read \\"UNPRESIDENTED\\" and the lead article described Donald Trump's resignation from the presidency after a period of unrest. The Yes Men took credit for the edition.

Scams and Controversies 26/11 attacks controversy and resignation In the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Public opinion forced Vilasrao, and his deputy, the state home minister, R. R. Patil, to resign for being perceived as inept administrators and insensitive to the problems facing people in the state. He took the moral responsibility and offered to resign, which was then accepted by the party. A contributory factor in his resignation was the conducted tour he offered to film director Ram Gopal Varma to the terror site of The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel after the attack.\\" Adarsh allegations An affidavit filed in the Bombay High Court on 27 April 2012 alleges that Deshmukh might be owning two flats through proxies in the Adarsh housing society in Mumbai. The scam is pending for further investigation. Union Minister of Power Sushil Kumar Shinde, on 25 June, told a judicial panel the decision to allot government land and grant of additional Floor Space Index to the housing society was taken during Deshmukh's tenure as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Involvement with Education Trusts Deshmukh founded the Manjra Charitable Trust which runs a number of colleges in Latur & Mumbai. Some of them are Manajara Ayurvedic Medical College & Hospital Latur, Abhinav college Latur, VDF polytechnique, VDF pharmacy college, VDF engineering college, Goldcrest high ICSE school, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology at Versova, Andheri in Mumbai and Sushiladevi Deshmukh Vidyalaya at Latur & Airoli, Navi Mumbai. He also founded Marathwada Mitramandal under which there are two engineering colleges and one commerce college in Pune. and another one in Marathwada Mitra Mandal's Institute of Technology Lohegaon, Pune Illness and death Deshmukh was diagnosed with cirrhosis in summer 2011.

He was admitted to Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital in the first week of August 2012, where he was diagnosed with liver and kidney failure. He was flown to Chennai for a liver transplant by air ambulance on 6 August. Attempts to commence the liver transplant failed as a clinically dead man, whose liver and kidney were to be transplanted into Deshmukh, died the night before the operation. He died the following day on 14 August at 14:00 due to an apparent multiple organ failure. He died in the presence of his family. Reactions included INC president Sonia Gandhi who said his death was a great loss to the party. President Pranab Mukherjee paid tribute and expressed grief, as did Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who called Deshmukh \\"a trusted colleague and an able administrator who worked at panchayat, state and central levels with admirable dedication.\\" Maharashtra BJP opposition leader Prakash Javadekar reacted in saying: \\"It is a very sad news. He was warm-hearted and cheerful and always ready for helping (others). He had a vision for Maharashtra and was equally concerned about farmers and youngsters.\\" Minister of State for Science and Technology Ashwani Kumar called Deshmukh a \\"great human being\\" who had an ability to connect with people and that \\"he was very unwell. We were hoping for his recovery. I am saddened, shocked.\\" Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan said his death was \\"very unfortunate to lose such a promising leader at a young age.\\" Janata Dal United (JDU) leader Sharad Yadav said his death resulted in a \\"lot of pain,\\" while Nationalist Congress Party leader Praful Patel said: \\"He had a long journey in public life. He was a big leader, a wise leader. He knew all parts of Maharashtra very well. It is great loss for the country and big loss for Maharashtra.\\" Other condolences came from Maharashtra Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athawale. His death also elicited reaction from Bollywood, partly as a result of his son's career in filmdom. These included Madhuri Dixit, Karan Johar, Bipasha Basu, Dia Mirza and Raveena Tandon, as well as Shah Rukh Khan who called Deshmukh a \\"wonderful\\" gentleman and said \\"I'm feeling very sorry. I have known him (Vilasrao) for years. Riteish is a close friend of mine. I spoke to him. I am very sad, it is very unexpected.\\" His cremation took place on 15 August, India's Independence Day at Babhalgaon, his village, in Latur district.

Written by Gene Roddenberry, based on a story by Don Ingalls (under the pseudonym Jud Crucis), and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast on February 2, 1968. In the episode, the crew of the Enterprise discovers Klingon interference in the development of a formerly peaceful planet and joins them in what becomes an arms race. The episode was directed by Marc Daniels. Plot The Federation starship USS Enterprise orbits the planet Neural, a primitive world that Captain Kirk has visited before. On the planet, Kirk and First Officer Spock notice a group of villagers apparently preparing for an ambush. Kirk is surprised to see them with firearms, and their quarry seems to be a group of Hill People, one of whom, Tyree, Kirk recognizes. Forbidden to use phasers, Kirk throws a rock toward the villagers, causing one of their guns to go off. A chase ensues and Spock is shot. Once back aboard the Enterprise, Spock is taken to sickbay. Sensors detect a Klingon vessel in orbit around the planet, and Kirk suspects the Klingons of having supplied the firearms to the villagers. Kirk returns with McCoy, both in native dress, to investigate. The two are attacked by an indigenous creature called a Mugato,A horned white- furred gorilla-like creature, pronounced \\"mu-GAHT-u\\" which bites Kirk with its poisonous fangs before McCoy can kill it with his phaser. McCoy is unable to call for help, as the Enterprise has left orbit to avoid detection by the Klingons. A friendly group of Hill People arrive and take Kirk and McCoy to their camp, where Kirk discovers that his friend Tyree is now their leader. Tyree is married to Nona, a Kahn-ut-tu woman who can cure the mugato bite. Nona has been urging Tyree to acquire firearms for their tribe. On hearing of Kirk's arrival, Nona enters the cave and spies McCoy using his phaser to heat rocks. Nona is intrigued and quizzes Tyree about the mysterious guests. She then proceeds to treat Kirk, pressing a mahko root into cuts on their hands. At the conclusion of the ritual she claims that Kirk is now hers, and Tyree explains that, according to legend, he will be unable to refuse her anything as a result of the treatment. When Kirk recovers, he asks Tyree about the villagers' weapons. Tyree says he saw them for the first time a year ago and believed the villagers were making them. Kirk and McCoy decide to reconnoiter the village that night. Once there, they locate a forge in which they find a chrome steel drill and virtually carbon-free iron, evidence of outsiders' involvement. Soon a Klingon appears with the village leader, who discuss the manufacture of improved weapons. Kirk and McCoy surprise and overpower them, taking a flintlock weapon and escaping with Tyree's help. The next day, Kirk shows the Hill People how to use the weapon, but Tyree refuses to handle it. McCoy protests, but Kirk counters that both warring parties must be put on an equal footing if both are to survive. Nona tries to seduce Kirk with the help of local herbs. A mugato attacks Nona and Kirk disintegrates it with his phaser. Nona then knocks Kirk unconscious, flees with the phaser, and coming upon a group of villagers, offers them the weapon. Not believing her story, they assault her. When Kirk, McCoy, and Tyree appear, the villagers believe she has led them into a trap, and kill her. Tyree now demands more \\"fire stick\\" weapons to avenge his wife's death. Kirk reluctantly orders Mr. Scott to manufacture and beam down a hundred flintlocks for the tribesmen. Mr. Scott questions the unusual order, and Kirk answers, \\"Serpents for the Garden of Eden.\\" Production and reception The 1997 book, Inside Star Trek The Real Story suggested this episode was intended as an allegory about America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Don Ingalls' first draft of the script had specific references to the Vietnam War, such as Mongolian-type clothes and a character described as a \\"Ho Chi Minh\\" type. Other early ideas included Kirk's friendship with Tyree developing completely during Kirk's second visit to the planet and a personal conflict between Kirk and Krell the Klingon. The episode credit title shows \\"Gumato\\" as this was the creature's original name. Eugene Myers and Torie Atkinson of Tor.com argue that the episode is sexist in its presentation of Nona, and that the episode, in trying too hard to be an allegory for the war in Vietnam, fails to find a peaceful, Star Trek, solution to the problem.https://www.tor.com/2010/05/13/lemgstar-treklemg-re-watch-a- private-little-war/ A 2016 article in The New Yorker, noted that this episode was a commentary on the United States' involvement in Vietnam. In 2017, Inverse recommended \\"A Private Little War\\" as \\"essential watching\\" for Star Trek: Discovery. In 2018, Collider ranked this episode the 14th best original series episode.

Definition Let L = \\\\langle \\\\in \\\\rangle be the language of set theory. Let S be a particular set theory, for example the ZFC axioms and let T (possibly the same as S) also be a theory in L. If M is a model for S, and N is an L-structure such that #N is a substructure of M, i.e. the interpretation \\\\in_N of \\\\in in N is {\\\\in_M} \\\\cap N^2 #N is a model for T #the domain of N is a transitive class of M #N contains all ordinals of M then we say that N is an inner model of T (in M). Usually T will equal (or subsume) S, so that N is a model for S 'inside' the model M of S. If only conditions 1 and 2 hold, N is called a standard model of T (in M), a standard submodel of T if S = T. A model N of T in M is called transitive when it is standard and condition 3 holds. If the axiom of foundation is not assumed (that is, is not in S) all three of these concepts are given the additional condition that N be well-founded. Hence inner models are transitive, transitive models are standard, and standard models are well-founded. The assumption that there exists a standard submodel of ZFC (in a given universe) is stronger than the assumption that there exists a model. In fact, if there is a standard submodel, then there is a smallest standard submodel called the minimal model contained in all standard submodels. The minimal submodel contains no standard submodel (as it is minimal) but (assuming the consistency of ZFC) it contains some model of ZFC by the G√∂del completeness theorem. This model is necessarily not well-founded otherwise its Mostowski collapse would be a standard submodel. (It is not well-founded as a relation in the universe, though it satisfies the axiom of foundation so is \\"internally\\" well-founded. Being well- founded is not an absolute property., Page 117) In particular in the minimal submodel there is a model of ZFC but there is no standard submodel of ZFC. Use Usually when one talks about inner models of a theory, the theory one is discussing is ZFC or some extension of ZFC (like ZFC + \\\\exists a measurable cardinal). When no theory is mentioned, it is usually assumed that the model under discussion is an inner model of ZFC. However, it is not uncommon to talk about inner models of subtheories of ZFC (like ZF or KP) as well. Related ideas It was proved by Kurt G√∂del that any model of ZF has a least inner model of ZF (which is also an inner model of ZFC + GCH), called the constructible universe, or L. There is a branch of set theory called inner model theory that studies ways of constructing least inner models of theories extending ZF. Inner model theory has led to the discovery of the exact consistency strength of many important set theoretical properties.

Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and most noteworthy chief of the SS was Heinrich Himmler. Definition Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was both a title and a rank. The title of Reichsf√ºhrer was first created in 1926 by the second commander of the SS, Joseph Berchtold. Julius Schreck, founder of the SS and Berchtold's predecessor, never referred to himself as Reichsf√ºhrer. Yet, the title was retroactively applied to him in later years. In 1929, Heinrich Himmler became Reichsf√ºhrer-SS and referred to himself by his title instead of his regular SS rank of Obergruppenf√ºhrer. This set the precedent for the commander of the SS to be called Reichsf√ºhrer-SS. Prior to the Night of the Long Knives, the SS was an elite corps of the Sturmabteilung (SA or storm troopers), and the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was subordinate to the SA's operating head, the Stabschef. On 20 July 1934, as part of the purge of the SA, the SS was made an independent branch of the Nazi Party, responsible only to Hitler. From that point on, the title of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS became an actual rank, and in fact the highest rank of the SS. In this position, Himmler was on paper the equivalent of a Generalfeldmarschall in the German Army. As Himmler's position and authority grew in Nazi Germany, so did his rank in a \\"de facto\\" sense. Further, there was never more than one Reichsf√ºhrer-SS at any one time, with Himmler holding the position as his personal title from 1929 (becoming his actual rank in 1934) until April 1945. Duties Under its original inception, the title and rank of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was the designation for the head of the Allgemeine-SS (General-SS). In this capacity, the SS Reich Leader was the direct commander of the SS Senior District Leaders (SS-Oberabschnitt F√ºhrer); by 1936, the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was head of the three main SS branches: the Allgemeine-SS, SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe (SS-VT; Political Action Troops), and the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde (SS-TV; Concentration Camp Service). During the Second World War, the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS in effect held several additional roles and wielded enormous personal power. He was responsible for all internal security within Nazi Germany. He was overseer of the concentration camps, extermination camps (through the Concentration Camps Inspectorate and SS-TV), and the Einsatzgruppen mobile death squads (through the RSHA). Over time, his influence on both civil and foreign policy became marked, as the Reichsf√ºhrer reported directly to Hitler and his actions were not tempered by checks and balances. This meant the office holder could implement broad policy, such as the Nazi plan for the Genocide or extermination of the Jews, or order criminal acts such as the Stalag Luft III murders, without impediment. It is difficult to separate the office from the duties assigned to the individual. As of 20 April 1934, Himmler in his position of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS already controlled the SD and Gestapo. On 17 June 1936 Himmler was named chief of all German police, thereby placing all uniformed police (Orpo) and criminal police (Kripo) in Germany under his control. In the latter role, he was nominally subordinate to the Interior Minister, Wilhelm Frick. It is not clear how much of this power would technically reside in the office of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS were those duties to be split up. These questions became moot by the time Himmler became the Interior Minister in 1943. It is difficult to define precisely the full detailed duties and responsibilities of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS beyond that of leader and senior member of the SS, since, in the words of historian Martin Windrow, \\"by the outbreak of the (Second World) war it would have been impossible to define exactly the role within the state\\" of the entire SS itself. Relationship with the Waffen-SS The rank of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS was defined in the SS hierarchy as the highest possible rank of the Allgemeine-SS. The exact position of the rank within the military Waffen-SS evolved over many years, ranging from clearly defined to vaguely associated. The Waffen-SS was originally a small armed SS unit called the SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe, and in the 1930s was under the command of Himmler who, in his position as Reichsf√ºhrer- SS, issued directives and orders to SS-VT commanders. Hold-outs existed for some aspects of the armed SS however, as well as within the special bodyguard unit known as the SS-Leibstandarte. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Sepp Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. The Waffen-SS eventually grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions and served alongside the German Army, but was never formally part of it. During World War II, the authority of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS over the Waffen- SS was mainly administrative in that certain General-SS offices controlled supply and logistics aspects of the Waffen-SS. Himmler also held authority to create new Waffen-SS divisions as well as order the formation of various smaller SS combat units. The daily association with the Waffen-SS, however, encompassed primarily inspecting Waffen-SS troops and presenting high-ranking medals to its members. The Reichsf√ºhrer-SS further never exercised direct operational authority over Waffen-SS units until the very end of the war and then only through his capacity as an Army Group commander and not as the head of the SS. Top Waffen-SS commanders, such as Sepp Dietrich, Wilhelm Bittrich, and Matthias Kleinheisterkamp, further held a certain derision for Himmler, describing him as \\"sly and unmilitary\\".  Kommandostab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS  Attached to the office was the 18,438-strong SS formations managed by the Kommandostab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (\\"Command Staff Reichsf√ºhrer-SS\\") reporting directly to Himmler. To head the Command Staff, Himmler appointed career army officer Kurt Knoblauch, who acted as chief of staff for the units. Prior to the launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, these formations included two motorized SS-Infantry Brigades, two SS-Cavalry Regiments combined into the SS Cavalry Brigade, a bodyguard battalion, flak units and a number of companies of support troops. Units were temporarily placed under army command for operations, but the Reichsf√ºhrer could call them back at any time. Despite the name, it was not employed as a unified HQ unit. Instead, its individual units were sent to occupied areas, subordinated to local Higher SS and Police Leaders (HSSPFs) and used for \\"pacification actions\\" alongside the Einsatzgruppen. Often these actions were atrocities and mass murders, targeting Jews and \\"suspected partisans\\". Office holders In all, five people held the title of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS during the twenty years of its existence. Three persons held the position as a title while two held the actual SS rank. Hanke was appointed SS leader in April 1945, but not informed until early May. He was captured by Czech partisans on 6 May and interned. He was killed on 8 June, while attempting to escape a POW camp. Historians have often speculated that Reinhard Heydrich would have eventually held the rank had Himmler in some way been killed or removed from his position earlier in World War II, and indeed Heydrich was often seen as Himmler's heir apparent by senior SS leaders. However, at a diplomatic function in Italy in 1941, Heydrich was reported as stating that he had no desire to succeed Himmler.

It occurs throughout Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It used to be common in Europe but has now become rare there. Because of the vast geographic area it occupies, which comprises many different ecological zones, numerous subspecies have been described. However, not all experts agree on the validity of some of these subspecies. Many other species of grasshopper with gregarious and possibly migratory behaviour are referred to as 'locusts' in the vernacular, including the widely distributed desert locust. At 6.5 Gbp, the migratory locust possesses the largest known insect genome. 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license Polyphenism The migratory locust is polyphenic. It transitions between two main phenotypes in response to population density; the solitary phase and the gregarious phase. As the density of the population increases the locust transforms progressively from the solitary phase towards the gregarious phase with intermediate phases: :Solitaire = solitary phase ‚Üí transiens congregans (intermediate form) ‚Üí gregarious phase ‚Üí transiens dissocians (intermediate form) ‚Üí solitaire = solitary phase. Pigmentation and size of the migratory locust vary according to its phase (gregarious or solitary form) and its age. Gregarious larvae have a yellow to orange covering with black spots; solitary larvae are green or brown. The gregarious adult is brownish with yellow, the latter colour becoming more intense and extensive on maturation. The solitary adult is brown with varying extent of green colour depending on the colour of the vegetation. Gregarious adults vary in size between 40 and 60 mm according to the sex; they are smaller than the solitary adults. The phase transition may be mediated by DNA methylation in the brain. Expression of the DNA methyltrasferase gene Dnmt3 is high in the brain of the gregarious form, decreases in gregarious locusts when they are isolated, and increases in solitary locusts when they are crowded. Knock-down reduces phase-related locomotor activity. Transcriptionally, Dnmt3 is linked with phase-core transcriptional factor, hormone receptor HR3 . Relationship with humans Economic impact Adult female (top), adult male (bottom left), fifth instar nymph (bottom right) Locusts are highly mobile, and usually fly with the wind at a speed of about . Swarms can travel 5 to 130 km or more in a day. Locust swarms can vary from less than one square kilometre to several hundred square kilometres with 40 to 80 million individuals per square kilometre. An adult locust can consume its own weight (several grams) in fresh food per day. For every million locusts, one ton of food is eaten. In Africa, the last serious widespread plague of L. m. migratorioides occurred from 1928 to 1942. Since then, environmental transformations have made the development of swarms from the African migratory locust unlikely. Nevertheless, potential outbreaks are constantly monitored as plagues can be devastating. The Malagasy migratory locust (L. m. capito) still regularly swarms (roughly twice every ten years). The desert locust, which is very similar to the African migratory locust, remains a major threat too. Locust survey and control are primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture in locust-affected countries and are operations undertaken by national locust units. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations provides information on the general locust situation to all interested countries and gives warnings and forecasts to those countries in danger of invasion. As food / edibility The migratory locust is an edible insect.Barsics, F., 2010. L'alimentation des Populations locales de Madagascar productrices de Vers √† Soie. - Univ. de Li√®ge.: 1-84.

He scored excellent results in major international tournaments, including first at Amsterdam 1926, ahead of Savielly Tartakower and future world champion Max Euwe; first at Meran 1926, in a strong field ahead of Esteban Canal; and won twice outright at Scarborough in 1927, and again in 1930, ahead of Mar√≥czy and Rubinstein. Colle's playing career was hampered by ill health. He survived three difficult operations for a gastric ulcer and died after a fourth at the age of 34 in Ghent. Legacy Colle is remembered today primarily for his introduction of the chess opening now known as the Colle System: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3. White normally follows up with Bd3, 0-0, and Nbd2, playing for a central with e4. The opening is in effect a reversed Semi-Slav Defense. In response to ...c5 by Black, White typically plays c3. The Colle System was most often played in the late 1920s and 1930s. Colle himself played it from 1925 until his death in 1932. He won many games with the opening, including a number of . Colle‚ÄìO'Hanlon, Nice 1930, featuring one of the best-known examples of a Greek gift sacrifice, is especially famous. The opening gained popularity, especially in the United States, through the efforts of Belgian-American International Master George Koltanowski, who remained faithful to it throughout his long career, and wrote several books on it. Koltanowski said he played the opening as a tribute to his friend Colle. The opening is sometimes referred to as the Colle‚ÄìKoltanowski. The Colle System fell out of favor in high-level play as good defenses were found for Black. Chess theory today regards it as safe but somewhat passive. However, because of its solid pawn structure, logical piece placement, and coherent strategic aims, the opening is often taught to novice players as a safe and dependable way to reach a middlegame. Thus, the Colle System is frequently seen in amateur and scholastic tournaments, but is not common in professional play; however, it has been used in recent times by grandmasters Pia Cramling, Susan Polgar, Artur Yusupov, who prefers to play with b3 and a fianchetto, a setup known as the Colle‚ÄìZukertort, and, most notably, Magnus Carlsen.

It was closely related to the original rear-wheel drive GM C and GM D platforms, and was used for convertibles, hardtops, coup√©s, sedans, and station wagons. With approximately 12,960,000 units built, divided across four marques, the 1965-70 GM B platform is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T and the Lada Riva. Originally, the B platform was used for Buick and Oldsmobile products, with the first GM A platform for Chevrolet and Oakland, and the above GM C and D platforms devoted to Cadillac. During the General Motors Companion Make Program, Vikings and Marquettes were also manufactured on this platform, as were La Salles from 1936 to 1940. The B platform was used for the Pontiac Streamliner Torpedo and Streamliner, the Oldsmobile Series L, Series 70 and Series 88, the Buick Special and Century, the LaSalle Series 50 and the Cadillac Series 60, Series 61 and Series 63. The B platform became GM's base model platform in 1958, when all existing Chevrolet products were upgraded to the B platform. For the 1959 model year, the previous A and B bodies were built on the new B platform that lasted until 1996. During this period, the B was the most modest of GM's three full-sized platforms, slotting below the upscale C and the luxury D. The A platform designation would be resurrected by GM in 1964 for a new series of intermediate-sized cars including the Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac Tempest, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Buick Skylark. History The GM B platform was introduced in 1926 with the Buick Master Six, and the Oldsmobile Model 30, and had at least 12 major re-engineering and restyling efforts, in 1937, 1939, 1941, 1949, 1954, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1977, and 1991; along with interim styling changes in 1942, 1969 and 1980 that included new sheetmetal and revised rooflines. The platform was downsized in length by approximately 10 inches in 1977 and reduced in weight by an average of 800 pounds. In 1991, the platform received its last major redesign, regaining several inches in length, numerous frame improvements and reinforcements, while the shorter wheelbase remained unchanged. The last B-cars rolled off the line in 1996, leaving only Ford producing domestic large rear wheel drive sedans until the line was phased out in late 2011, with Chrysler reentering the market with their LX platform in 2005. Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon Known for being durable and reliable, most B platform cars used suspensions utilizing coil springs in the front and leaf-springs in the rear until 1958, when they switched to coils in the rear; exceptions include the 1959-60 Oldsmobile 88, which used coil springs in front and multi-leaf springs in the rear. All B platform cars since 1965 have used perimeter frames with side rails, along with the 1961-64 B platform Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles. The 1958-60 Buicks and 1959-60 Oldsmobiles used a ladder-type frame while an X-frame without side rails was used on 1959-60 Pontiacs, 1959-64 Chevrolets and 1961-64 Buicks. The Rear Drive B platform was the last platform design to have the gasoline tank filler port behind the license plate after 1958. Exceptions included all station wagons, as well as all 1961-64 cars - which had the tank filler in the rear fender on the driver's side and 1965 Buicks which had their fuel filler door above the license plate. Also, the Pontiac B platform vehicles from 1941 till 1948 had the fuel filler door in the rear fender on the driver's side. Very likely this would also have been the case with the B platform Oldsmobile and Buick. By 1986, the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Delta 88 moved to the GM H platform. And in 1991, Chairman Robert Stempel said: He also stated that the rear drive 1992 Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice had been produced \\"over my dead body.\\" No successor for this platform was made after 1996, when the Roadmaster and Caprice ceased production. However, the Caprice would be revived and built on the Opel developed V platform for the Middle East but built by Holden, while years later the Caprice for police use along with the Impala SS successor, the Chevrolet SS, would return to America built on the GM Zeta Platform which was developed by Holden in Australia.

John Hall. The group advocates against the use of nuclear energy, forming shortly after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in March 1979. MUSE organized a series of five No Nukes concerts held at Madison Square Garden in New York in September 1979. On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the Battery Park City landfill in New York.Commentary: Stealth Nuke Effort Should be Stopped by Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash & Harvey Wasserman: Special to CNN in Planet in Peril/CNN.com (October 12, 2007) Other musicians performing at the concerts included Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Chaka Khan, the Doobie Brothers, Jesse Colin Young, Gil Scott-Heron, Tom Petty, Dan Fogelberg, Poco and others. The album No Nukes, and a film, also titled No Nukes, were both released in 1980 to document the performances. A full No Nukes concert featuring Browne and Crosby, Stills & Nash was also filmed near the beach in Ventura, California, at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, but none of that footage made it into the final cut. In the 2006 midterm elections, Hall was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York's 19th congressional district, on a platform that included intensive investment in alternative energy. He defeated the incumbent, Sue Kelly.

As its premier luxury division, Cadillac, didn't offer a station wagon, the Estate was GM's most expensive and most fully equipped entry in the market. Early history The first Buick Estate station wagon was a large-bodied GM C platform Super modified with a wooden body, shared with the Oldsmobile Series 60. In 1941 and 1942 it was available on Buick's B platform Special series, and later on Buick's C platform (Roadmaster and Super) in the 1946‚Äì53 model years. From 1954 to 1958 it was only offered on the smaller B platform Century and Special, with all steel bodies. Among these were hardtop Estate Wagons called Caballero that were offered only in 1957 and 1958. From 1959 through 1964 the Estate Wagon was offered on the B platform Invicta and LeSabre. In 1965, the Estate Wagon was replaced by the new, smaller A platform Buick Sport Wagon, making the B-body Chevrolet Impala Estate and Pontiac Safari the only full-sized GM station wagons until 1970. 1940s File:1941 Buick Special Eight Model 49 Estate Wagon, front left.jpg|1941 Buick Special Estate (Model 49) File:Buick Woodie (3849559649).jpg|1942 Buick Special Estate (Model 49) 1950s File:1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon.jpg|1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate File:1952 Buick Woody Estate Wagon.JPG|1952 Buick Super Estate File:1953 Buick Super Estate Wagon.jpg|1953 Buick Super Estate, last of the genuine \\"woodies\\" File:Buick Special Station Wagon 1955.jpg|1955 Buick Special Estate File:Flickr - Hugo90 - 1956 Buick Special.jpg|1956 Buick Special Estate File:Buick Century Caballero 1958.jpg|1958 Buick Century Caballero Estate hardtop 1960s File:Buick VC 3 1964 - 9471.jpg|1964 Buick LeSabre Estate File:1966 Buick Sport Wagon (15144528560).jpg|1966 Buick Skylark Sport Wagon File:1967 Buick Sport Wagon.jpg|1967 Buick Skylark Sport Wagon Custom File:Sportwagondr9945.JPG|1969 Buick Skylark Sport Wagon 1970 The Buick Estate wagon was re-introduced as the top-level luxury station wagon for GM in 1970 to compete against the Mercury Colony Park and Chrysler Town & Country. Buick's first full-sized station wagon since 1964, it was available as a separate series on the B-body LeSabre and Wildcat, sharing their wheelbase, basic body and interior. The LeSabre Custom's bright rocker, wheelhouse and rear lower fender moldings were used. Woodgrain was an option for the body sides, incorporating the traditional \\"Sweepspear\\" feature. Interiors were all vinyl in a Custom grade. Despite being on the B-body it shared the C-body division flagship Electra's 455 cubic inch V8 and four VentiPorts on the front fenders. The following year the Estate would move up to Electra's larger body and more voluminous interior.  1971‚Äì1976 The 1971 to 1976 Estates were the first Buick station wagons to be built on its largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947‚Äì53. However, even though the Estate shared its C-body wheelbase with the Electra 225, all 1971‚Äì76 GM wagons were assigned B-body-based per model numbers.1976 Buick sales brochure says wagon models are 4BR35 and 4BR45. One telltale is the lower inside door trim which was hard plastic in 1971‚Äì76 B-bodies and padded vinyl in C-bodies. Wheelbase is not a good indicator of body; check rear legroom. The 1971‚Äì76 GM full-size bodies, at front shoulder room and rear shoulder room set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid 1990s. The Estate also shared the Electra 225's interior and exterior styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). Door trim and seats were not as plush in 1971‚Äì74 wagons and no door pull strap was included as it was on the Electra. Although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's (as was door trim and seats), the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. The taillights were different from both the LeSabre and the Electra in all of these years. The Estate Wagons, as with other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new 'clamshell' tailgate design, marketed as the Glide-away Tailgate, where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the lower tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. Ultimately, the manual lower tailgate was supplanted by the power tailgate. The tailgate system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. Like a top-hinged tailgate, the clamshell design allowed a user to stand directly at the open cargo area without impediment, facilitating loading and unloading in tight spaces. the rear seat could be folded flat for additional cargo, and incorporated a 60/40 split so that extended cargo and passengers could be accommodated. 1974 Buick Estate Wagon In its first year, 24,034 Estate Wagons were sold.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960‚Äì1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p. 793. At shipping weight, or about curb weight, the three-seat 1974 Estate Wagons are easily the heaviest Buicks ever built, even heavier than the Buick Limited limousines of 1936‚Äì42. The 1975 and 1976 models were the longest station wagons ever built. The Estate used the Buick 455 from 1971 to 1976 throughout. The last year that the Stage One high performance version, with high lift camshaft, enlarged ports, enlarged valves and dual exhaust was available was in 1974.  1977‚Äì1990 1980s Buick Electra Estate 1982 Buick Electra Estate 1990 Buick Estate In 1977, the Buick Estate was downsized and relaunched on General Motors' B-body. In 1979, an Estate Wagon Limited was offered with many previously extra cost options now included as standard. To further differentiate the Limited model, fenders included four VentiPorts (up from three) and the interior had loose pillow designed seating. In 1980, body changes made the wagon more aerodynamic for better fuel efficiency. Also that year, the Electra Estate Wagon was introduced and replaced the Estate Wagon Limited while the 'base' model was now called LeSabre Estate Wagon. Exterior woodgrain applique was standard on the Electra Estate (but could be deleted for credit) and optional on the LeSabre Estate. The Buick 350 V8 engine was dropped from the options list and a 5.7 litre diesel 350 V8 was now available through 1985. The standard engine was the 5.0 litre Oldsmobile 307. Although the Electra and LeSabre coupes and sedans had both switched to new front wheel drive platforms by 1986, the model names also continued to be used on the rear wheel drive wagons through 1989. In 1990, its final year, the Electra and LeSabre model designations were dropped and the car was once again sold simply as the Estate Wagon. As with the Electra Estate in previous years, standard exterior woodgrain could be deleted for credit. Although the Estate Wagon model was discontinued in 1990, the Estate trim designation continued on the full-size Roadmaster station wagons from 1991 to 1996. The Estate name was also applied to the top trim level of the mid-size Century station wagon (sold as the Regal station wagon in 1982 and 1983) and often included exterior woodgrain applique. Like the Roadmaster, the Century Estate continued to be sold through 1996. 1991‚Äì1996 1993 Buick Roadmaster Estate Buick revived the Roadmaster name with the introduction of the Roadmaster Estate in 1991. A \\"Vista Roof\\" fixed sunroof over the second row seats, was standard. Initially the Roadmaster Estate used Chevrolet's 5.0 L L03 V8. It was replaced a year later with a 180hp 5.7L small-block L05 V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994 both received a modified dual-exhaust version of the advanced Corvette-derived 5.7L sequential point fuel-injection LT1 V8, increasing output to 260hp and upping performance substantially. The same engine was used on the Impala SS, Chevrolet police interceptors, and the Cadillac Fleetwood, with an aluminum head version on the Corvette C4, Camaro Z-28, and Firebird Trans-AM. A high-performance engine had last been offered on a GM station wagon in 1974. GM discontinued the Roadmaster Estate in 1996, ending production on December 13 of that year.

Union Square, a transit-oriented development centred on Kowloon Station, Hong Kong In urban planning, a transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport. It promotes a symbiotic relationship between dense, compact urban form and public transport use. In doing so, TOD aims to increase public transport ridership by reducing the use of private cars and by promoting sustainable urban growth.Robert Cervero, Chris Ferrell and Steven Murphy (2002). Transit-Oriented Development and Joint Development in the United States: A Literature Review, Research Results Digest Number 52, Transit Cooperative Research Program. A TOD typically includes a central transit stop (such as a train station, or light rail or bus stop) surrounded by a high-density mixed-use area, with lower-density areas spreading out from this center. A TOD is also typically designed to be more walkable than other built-up areas, through using smaller block sizes and reducing the land area dedicated to automobiles. The densest areas of a TOD are normally located within a radius of ¬º to ¬Ω mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop, as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians, thus solving the last mile problem. Description A Short History of Traffic Engineering 400px Many of the new towns created after World War II in Japan, Sweden, and France have many of the characteristics of TOD communities. In a sense, nearly all communities built on reclaimed land in the Netherlands or as exurban developments in Denmark have had the local equivalent of TOD principles integrated in their planning, including the promotion of bicycles for local use. In the United States, a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for TODs. A half mile (800 m) corresponds to the distance someone can walk in 10 minutes at and is a common estimate for the distance people will walk to get to a rail station. The half- mile ring is a little more than in size. Transit-oriented development is sometimes distinguished by some planning officials from \\"transit-proximate development\\" (see, e.g., comments made during a Congressional hearingClean Air and Transportation: Vital Concerns for TEA-21 Reauthorization ) because it contains specific features that are designed to encourage public transport use and differentiate the development from urban sprawl. A few examples of these features include mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of day, excellent pedestrian facilities such as high quality pedestrian crossings, narrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node. Another key feature of transit- oriented development that differentiates it from \\"transit-proximate development\\" is reduced amounts of parking for personal vehicles. Opponents of compact, or transit oriented development typically argue that Americans, and persons throughout the world, prefer low-density living, and that any policies that encourage compact development will result in substantial utility decreases and hence large social welfare costs. Proponents of compact development argue that there are large, often unmeasured benefits of compact development or that the American preference for low-density living is a misinterpretation made possible in part by substantial local government interference in the land market. TOD in cities Many cities throughout the world are developing TOD policy. Toronto, Portland, Montreal, San Francisco, and Vancouver among many other cities have developed, and continue to write policies and strategic plans, which aim to reduce automobile dependency and increase the use of public transit. Latin America Example of Curitiba's RIT in Pra√ßa do Jap√£o Curitiba, Brazil One of the earliest and most successful examples of TOD is Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba was organized into transport corridors very early on in its history. Over the years, it has integrated its zoning laws and transportation planning to place high-density development adjacent to high-capacity transportation systems, particularly its BRT corridors. Since the failure of its first rather grandiose city plan due to lack of funding, Curitiba has focused on working with economical forms of infrastructure, so it has arranged unique adaptations, such as bus routes (inexpensive infrastructure) with routing systems, limited access and speeds similar to subway systems. The source of innovation in Curitiba has been a unique form of participatory city planning that emphasizes public education, discussion and agreement. Guatemala City, Guatemala In an attempt to control rapid growth of Guatemala City, the long-time Mayor of Guatemala City √Ålvaro Arz√∫ implemented a plan to control growth based on transects along important arterial roads and exhibiting transit-oriented development (TOD) characteristics. This plan adopted POT (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial) aims to allow the construction of taller, mixed-use building structures right by large arterial roads; the buildings would gradually decrease in height and density the farther they are from arterial roads. This is simultaneously being implemented along with a bus rapid transit (BRT) system called Transmetro. Mexico City, Mexico Mexico City has battled pollution for years. Many attempts have been made to orient citizens towards public transportation. Expansion of metro line, both subway and bus, have been instrumental. Following the example of Curtiba, many bus-lines were created on many of Mexico City's most important streets. The bus-line has taken two lanes from cars to be used only by the bus-line, increasing the flow for bus transit. The city has also made great attempts at increasing the number of bike lanes, including shutting down entire roads on certain days to be used only by bikers. Car regulations have also increased in the city. New regulations prevent old cars from driving in the city, other cars from driving on certain days. Electric cars are allowed to be driven everyday and have free parking. Decreasing the public space allocated to cars and increasing regulations have become a great annoyance among daily car users. The city hopes to push people to use more public transport. North America Canada =Edmonton, Alberta= Most of the suburban high rises were not along major rail lines like other cities until recently, when there has been incentive to do so. Century Park is a growing condo community in southern Edmonton at the south end of Edmonton's LRT. It will include low to high rise condos, recreational services, shops, restaurants, and a fitness centre. Edmonton has also had a transit-proximate development for some time in the northeastern suburbs at Clareview which includes a large park and ride, and low rise apartments among big box stores and associated power center parking. Edmonton is also looking into some new TODs in various parts of the city. In the northeast, there are plans to redevelop underutilized land at two sites around existing LRT, Fort Road and Stadium station. In the west, there is plans to have some medium density condos in the Glenora neighbourhood along a future LRT route as well as a TOD in the southeast in the Strathearn neighbourhood along the same future LRT on existing low rise apartments. =Montreal, Quebec= According to the Metropolitan Development and Planning RegulationUn premier plan d‚Äôam√©nagement durable pour le Grand Montr√©al Voir vert - Le portail du b√¢timent durable au Qu√©bec.

These priority areas are a mix of moderate to high-density transit-supportive developments within a 600-metre walking distance of rapid transit stations. =Toronto, Ontario= Toronto has a longstanding policy of encouraging new construction along the route of its primary Yonge Street subway line. Most notable are the development of the Yonge and Eglinton area in the 1960s and 1970s; and the present development of the 2 km of the Yonge Street corridor north of Sheppard Avenue, which began in the late 1980s. In the period since 1997 alone the latter stretch has seen the appearance of a major new shopping centre and the building and occupation of over twenty thousand new units of condominium housing. Since the opening of the Sheppard subway line in 2002, there is a condominium construction boom along the route on Sheppard Avenue East between Yonge Street and Don Mills Road. =Vancouver, British Columbia= Vancouver has a strong history of creating new development around its SkyTrain lines and building regional town centres at major stations and transit corridors. Of note is the Metrotown area of the suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia near the Metrotown SkyTrain Station. The areas around stations have spurred the development of billions of dollars of high-density real estate, with multiple highrises near the many stations, prompting concerns about rapid gentrification. =Winnipeg, Manitoba= There is currently one TOD being built in Winnipeg beside the rapid transit corridor. It is known as The Yards at Fort Rouge,http://winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/Secondary_Plans/FortRougeYards/BackgroundStudy- FortRougeYards-June-04.pdf and was spearheaded by the developer Gem Equities. In phase two of the southwest rapid transit corridor, there will be four more TODs. This phase is an interesting example of the use of fine arts in parallel with transit planning, making several of the stations sites for public art related to the social history of the area. United States =Arlington County, Virginia= For over 30 years, the government has pursued a development strategy of concentrating much of its new development within from the County's Washington Metro rapid transit stations and the high- volume bus lines of Columbia Pike. Within the transit areas, the government has a policy of encouraging mixed-use and pedestrian- and transit-oriented development.http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/planning/powerpoint/rbpresentation/rbpresentation_060107.pdf Some of these \\"urban village\\" communities include Rosslyn, Ballston, Clarendon, Courthouse, Pentagon City, Crystal City, Lyon Village, Shirlington, Virginia Square, and Westover In 2002, Arlington received the EPA's National Award for Smart Growth Achievement for \\"Overall Excellence in Smart Growth\\" ‚Äî the first ever granted by the agency. In September 2010, Arlington County, Virginia, in partnership with Washington, D.C., opened Capital Bikeshare, a bicycle sharing system. By February 2011, Capital Bikeshare had 14 stations in the Pentagon City, Potomac Yard, and Crystal City neighborhoods in Arlington. Arlington County also announced plans to add 30 stations in fall 2011, primarily along the densely populated corridor between the Rosslyn and Ballston neighborhoods, and 30 more in 2012. =Aurora, Colorado= The city has developed within its plan as of 2007 standardization measures.

Transit village development must also preserve the architectural integrity of historically significant buildings. Since 1999 the state has numerous Transit Village designations, which are in different stages of development:https://togethernorthjersey.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TNJ- Guidebook-for-Transit-Hub- Planning-6-5-19.pdf?mc_cid=0af6953751&mc;_eid=7af0cb106d Pleasantville (1999), Morristown (1999), Rutherford (1999), South Amboy (1999), South Orange (1999), Riverside (2001), Rahway (2002), Metuchen (2003), Belmar (2003), Bloomfield (2003), Bound Brook (2003), Collingswood (2003), Cranford (2003) Matawan (2003), New Brunswick (2005), Journal Square/Jersey City (2005), Netcong (2005), Midtown Elizabeth (2007), Burlington City (2007), Orange (2009), Montclair (2010), Somerville (2010), Linden (2010), West Windsor (2012), Dunellen (2012), Plainfield (2014), Park Ridge (2015), and Irvington (2015).http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/press/2014/032814.shtm =Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania= The East Liberty neighborhood is nearing completion of a $150 million Transit Oriented Development centered around the reconfigured East Liberty Station on the city's Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway.http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/9263121-74/east-liberty- centerhttp://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2015/01/09/New-platforms-at-East- Liberty-Station-to-open-tomorrow/stories/201501090226 The development included improved access to the station with a new pedestrian bridge and pedestrian walkways that increase the effective walkshed of the station. The East Busway is a fixed guideway route that offers riders an 8-minute ride from East Liberty to Pittsburgh's Downtown. =Salt Lake City Metro Area, Utah= The Salt Lake City Metro Area has seen a strong proliferation of transit- oriented developments due to the construction of new transit lines within the Utah Transit Authority's TRAX, FrontRunner and streetcar lines. New developments in West Valley, Farmington, Murray, Provo, Kaysville, Sugarhouse and downtown Salt Lake City have seen rapid growth and construction despite the economic downturn. The population along the Wasatch Front has reached 2.5 million and is expected to grow 50% over the next two decades. At 29.8%, Utah's population growth more than doubled the population growth of the nation (13.2%), with a vast majority of this growth occurring along the Wasatch Front. Transportation infrastructure has been vastly upgraded in the past decade as a result of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games and the need to support the growth in population. This has created a number of transit-oriented commercial and residential projects to be proposed and completed. =San Francisco Bay Area, California= The San Francisco Bay Area includes nine counties and 101 cities, including San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland and Fremont.

Major transit village projects have been developed over the past 20 years at several stations linked to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. In their 1996 book, Transit Villages in the 21st Century, Michael Bernick and Robert Cervero identified emerging transit villages at several BART stations, including Pleasant Hill / Contra Costa Centre, Fruitvale, Hayward and Richmond. MacArthur Station is a relatively new development, with construction beginning in 2011 and scheduled for completion after 2019. Asia and Oceania Hong Kong Sha Tin town centre, built around the Sha Tin railway station Compared to other developed economies, the car ownership rate in Hong Kong is very low, and approximately 90% of all trips are made by public transport. In the mid-20th century, no railway was built until an area was well developed. However, in recent decades, Hong Kong has started to have some TODs, where a railway is built simultaneously with residential development above or nearby, dubbed the \\"Rail plus Property\\" (R+P) Model. Examples include: * LOHAS Park * Olympian City * Tung Chung * Union Square Malaysia Bandar Malaysia is an upcoming development by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Indonesia Many TOD are now being constructed in Greater Jakarta metro area such as Citra Sentul Raya and Dukuh Atas TOD. TOD are also being constructed in cities like Surabaya, Medan, and Palembang. Melbourne, Victoria Chatswood Station in Sydney. Trains run through the integrated station, shopping and apartment complex. Melbourne, Victoria is expected to reach a population of 5 million by 2030 with the overwhelming majority of its residents relying on private automobiles. Since the turn of the century, sporadic efforts have been made by various levels of government to implement transit-oriented development principles. However, a lack of commitment to funding public transport infrastructure, resulting to overcrowding and amending zoning laws has dramatically slowed progress toward sustainable development for the city. Milton, Queensland Milton, an inner suburb of Brisbane, has been identified as Queensland's first transit-oriented development under the Queensland Government's South East Queensland Regional Plan. Milton railway station will undergo a multimillion-dollar revamp as part of the development of The Milton Residences to promote and encourage residents to embrace rail travel. This will include a new ticketing office, new public amenities, increased visibility across platforms and new and improved access points off Milton Road and Railway Terrace.Transit Oriented Development, Sustainable City Living The Milton.

New apartment and office tower developments along the future Sydney Metro stations are being planned as integrated developments with the stations themselves. Examples of this include Victoria Cross Station and Crows Nest Station whilst existing stations such as Castle Hill and Epping have also had intensified development.https://infrastructuremagazine.com.au/2017/11/03/sydney-stations- chosen-for-mass-transit-oriented-developments/ Europe Karen Blixen Park, √òrestad (Copenhagen), Denmark The term transit-oriented development, as a US- born concept, is rarely used in Europe, although many of the measures advocated in US transit-oriented development are also stressed in Europe. Many European cities have long been built around transit systems and there has thus often been little or no need to differentiate this type of development with a special term as has been the case in the US. An example of this is Copenhagen's Finger Plan from 1947, which embodied many transit-oriented development aspects and is still used as an overall planning framework today. Recently, scholars and technicians have taken interest in the concept, however. Paris, France Whereas the city of Paris has a centuries-long history, its main frame dates to the 19th century. The subway network was made to solve both linkage between the five main train stations and local transportation assets for citizens. The whole area of Paris City has metro stations no more than 500 metres apart. Recent bicycle and car rental systems (Velib and Autolib) also ease travel, in the very same way that TOD emphasizes. So do the new trams linking suburbs close to Paris proper, and tramline 3 around the edge of the city of Paris. Stedenbaan, Netherlands In the southern part of the Randstad a neighbourhood according to the principles of TOD will be built.http://www.thinkdeep.nl/documents/Papers/Hoeven.pdf Equity and housing cost concerns One criticism of transit-oriented development is that it has the potential to spur gentrification in low-income areas. In some cases, TOD can raise the housing costs of formerly affordable neighborhoods, pushing low- and moderate-income residents farther away from jobs and transit. When this happens, TOD projects can disrupt low-income neighborhoods. When executed with equity in mind, however, TOD has the potential to benefit low- and moderate- income (LMI) communities: it can link workers to employment centers, create construction and maintenance jobs, and has the potential to encourage investment in areas that have suffered neglect and economic depression. Moreover, it is well recognized that neighborhood development restrictions, while potentially in the immediate neighborhood's best interest, contribute to regional undersupply of housing and drive up the cost of housing in general across a region. TOD reduces the overall cost of housing in a region by contributing to the housing supply, and therefore generally improves equity in the housing market. TOD also reduces transportation costs, which can have a greater impact on LMI households since they spend a larger share of their income on transportation relative to higher-income households. This frees up household income that can be used on food, education, or other necessary expenses. Low-income people are also less likely to own personal vehicles and therefore more likely to depend exclusively on public transportation to get to and from work, making reliable access to transit a necessity for their economic success.

He attended Lowell Technological Institute (now the University of Massachusetts Lowell), where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity.2010 Pi Lambda Phi Membership Directory He graduated in 1972 with a bachelor of science degree in Nuclear Engineering. Ogonowski was a pilot in the U. S. Air Force during the Vietnam War, assigned to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, ferrying equipment to Asia and sometimes transporting the bodies of fallen in C-141 transport aircraft. Following his service commitment, he resigned his commission under honorable conditions and separated from the military with the rank of captain. Ogonowski became a commercial pilot in 1978. For 23 years, he flew airplanes for American Airlines, and was a member of the Allied Pilot Association. During the course of his commercial piloting career, he met Margaret, a flight attendant who went by the nickname \\"Peggy\\",Perry, David (September 11, 2006). \\"For pilot's widow, life goes on. ‚ÄòIt has to.'\\".

Roadmasters produced between 1936 and 1958 were built on Buick's longest non-limousine wheelbase and shared their basic structure with entry-level Cadillac and, after 1940, senior Oldsmobiles. Between 1946 and 1957 the Roadmaster served as Buick's flagship. When it was resurrected for the 1991 through 1996 model years, it became the marque's largest vehicle. The Roadmaster sedan, a C-body vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the B-body for the first time in its history. It was a full longer with a greater wheelbase than the C-body Buick Park Avenue. It was also larger both in wheelbase () and overall length () than the K-body Cadillac DeVille. 1931-1933 1932 Buick Series 80 Sedan The Series 80, which belonged to an upper category trim package, had a straight eight engine developing at 2,800 rpm. The next year a new high performance engine was introduced developing . In 1933, the model was completely revised. At the end of 1933 the 80 series was discontinued after 24,117 units produced. In 1936 the model was re-introduced and changed its name to \\"Series 80 Roadmaster\\". 1936‚Äì1937 The origins of the Roadmaster name date to 1936 when Buick added names to its entire model lineup to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models. Buick's Series 40 was named the Special, the Series 50 became the Super, the Series 60 was named the Century and the Series 90 ‚Äî Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicle ‚Äî was named the Limited. The Series 50 was retired, but new for the model year was the Series 80 Roadmaster. The implications of the name were clear, for as the 1936 Buick sales catalogue said, \\"It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway.\\" The Roadmaster was introduced in a year when Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick's larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono- block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front. The Roadmaster was a big car, in sedan form tipping the scales at 4,098 pounds, some 88 pounds heavier than Cadillac's new Series 60. But pricewise, the Roadmaster was a tremendous bargain. The sedan sold for $1,255, $440 less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style available was a four- door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 (of which only 1064 were produced), at a time when a Cadillac in the same body style sold at prices ranging from $2,745 to $7,850. Buick's new engineering and styling was a big hit, with model year sales more than tripling from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000, and with the all new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing a total of 16,049 units to that number. 1937 Buick Roadmaster sedan With the Roadmaster being a completely new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, one might have expected only modest changes for 1937. But that was not the case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up with the rest of the GM marques. For 1937, Buick moved to newly re- styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129. 1938‚Äì1939 1938 Roadmaster Spring and shock absorber mechanism on the rear wheels of the 1938 Buicks Styling changes for 1938 were modest, with a longer hood extending to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, but the effect was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four times the size of any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new \\"turbulator\\" pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141. The 4-door convertible phaeton traded its built-in trunk look for a fastback appearance, and a new fastback sedan was added to the line with 466 being sold. The Roadmaster's price was increased, but not as swiftly as the previous year, going to $1,645 for the sedan. Although Buick's overall market share increased in an off year, Roadmaster sales plummeted to 5,568, falling from 7.3 percent to 3.3 percent of Buick's total output. Styling for 1939 featured a new two-piece ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. Window area increased substantially with the rear window changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to in front of the driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the latter were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1,545) sales only rose to 6,097, with Roadmaster's share of Buick's total sales falling to 2.9 percent. 1940‚Äì1941 In 1940 the Series 80 was renamed Limited. The Roadmaster name was transferred to the new Series 70, which was introduced at the same time as a brand new Series 50 Super. The Roadmaster featured a cutting-edge \\"torpedo\\" C-body. The new C-body that the 1940 Buick Roadmaster shared with the Super, the Cadillac Series 62, the Oldsmobile Series 90, and the Pontiac Torpedo featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5\\" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3\\" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the Cadillac Sixty Special. The 1940 Roadmaster had a shorter wheelbase, was lighter, and was less expensive than the previous year's model. The formal and fastback sedans were gone, but for the first time a 2-door coupe was available, which sold a respectable 3,991 units. Also new for this year, the coach-building firm of Brunn was asked to design several custom-bodied Buicks for the Series 70, 80 and 90. Only one Roadmaster example is known to have actually been produced in 1940, an open-front town car not surprisingly called the Townmaster. Overall sales more than tripled to 18,345. The styling changes for 1941 were modest, but the changes under the hood were major. The compression ratio was raised from 6.6:1 to 7.0:1, the \\"turbulator\\" pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were substituted for the previous type and ‚ÄúCompound Carburetion‚Äù was introduced. Compound Carburetion was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor, and consisted of twin two- barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine delivered 165 horsepower. With five more horsepower than a senior Packard, 15 more than any Cadillac, and 25 more than the largest Chryslers, it was the most powerful engine available that year on an American car. A new bodystyle for this year was a 2-door convertible, which sold 1,845 units. There was also one Brunn designed convertible produced, but priced at $3,500 actual orders for the vehicle failed to appear. Overall sales remained respectable at 15,372. 1942‚Äì1948 1947 Buick Roadmaster The 1942 Roadmaster was longer, lower, wider, and roomier than before (a Harley Earl trademark), thanks in part to a longer wheelbase. There was also a new vertical-bar grille and \\"Airfoil\\" fenders that swept back all the way to the rear fenders, which in subsequent generations became the chromed \\"Sweepspear\\". Both features became a Buick icon exhibited in one way or another for years to come, and were influenced by the concept car called the Buick Y-Job. The 4-door phaeton was dropped and would never return. Coupes adopted the appealing Sedanet fastback style that had been the sensation of 1941 on the Century and Special. Effective at the beginning of 1942, new automobiles were available only to those in occupations deemed essential to the war effort. By mid-January, cars with no exterior chrome trim apart from the bumpers were being produced. By February passenger car production was shut down completely. Despite the abbreviated model year a total of about 8,400 were sold. When postwar automobile production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome was more sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans as well as coupes, and a war-inspired \\"bombsight\\" hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the bumper guard front and rear. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. As a consequence the 1946 Roadmaster's horsepower fell from 165 to 144. Torque on the other hand was hardly affected. Nevertheless, Roadmaster's I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top of the line Chrysler's. Owing to wartime inflation, prices were substantially higher than those of pre-war models. The biggest change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from four percent in 1941 to 20 percent in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold. In 1947 a new stamped grille with a separate upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front and rear. All new was an Estate wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became the top of the line in the station wagon market. In 1948 a series script appeared on the front fenders and the white Tenite steering wheel that had been used previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels trimmed in leatherette. Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of Dynaflow, the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year,https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1936-1992-buick-roadmaster4.htm it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year. 1949‚Äì1953 1949 Buick Roadmaster 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible 1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate wagon 1951 Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe 1953 Buick Roadmaster Riviera Sedan 1953 Buick Roadmaster Skylark convertible The Roadmaster received its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased. The biggest change was a much larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an ‚Äúobservation car.‚Äù It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced \\"VentiPorts.\\" Four were displayed on each of the Roadmaster's front fenders, with three on the fenders of the Super, Century, and Special. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car's hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief Harlow Curtice was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the relative displacement of the straight-eight engine installed. Dynaflow was now standard equipment, and engine horsepower was increased to 150 through a slight increase in the compression ratio. This contributed in conjunction with the now standard Dynaflow in giving the new Buicks a top speed of . In the middle of the year the Riviera, joined the body style lineup selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the 2-door Buick Roadmaster Riviera, along with the Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville and the Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, was among the first hardtop coupes ever produced. The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional \\"Sweepspear\\" chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the tail-light. The \\"Riviera trim\\", as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the model year. With a total of 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27 percent of all Buick sales, a remarkably high proportion in light of its price, which was only slightly less than a Cadillac Series 61. The 1950 restyling featured a grille so toothy that Consumer Reports commented that \\"a toothbrush for the dentures comes extra.\\" The Sweepspear had proved so popular in its first year that it was made standard on most body styles at the beginning of the 1950 model year, and on the station wagon and the new long wheelbase sedan mid-year. The long wheelbase sedan was stretched an extra four inches (102 mm). Like the convertibles, the Riviera and the extra plush long wheelbase sedan came with both power windows and power seats as standard equipment. Overall Roadmaster sales fell to 75,034, with Roadmaster's share of total Buick output plummeting to 12 percent, thanks mainly to the surging popularity of the Special. In 1951 the long wheelbase sedan was also called a Riviera although it was not a hardtop. The Sedanet and regular wheelbase sedan were cancelled. Styling changes were minimal in 1951 and 1952. Power steering was added as an option in 1952 and horsepower climbed to 170 thanks primarily to a new four-barrel carburetor. Sales continued to slide falling to about 66,000 in 1951 and to 51,000 in 1952. By 1953 the Roadmaster straight-eight was 16 years old and had become seriously dated. All of Roadmaster's major competitors had shifted to short- stroke V-8 engines, and if Buick wanted to continue to be the paragon of longer, lower and wider, it needed one of its own. The new engine was ready in time for 1953, Buick's Golden Anniversary year. Although the Nailhead (as it was popularly called) was nearly identical in displacement to the straight eight Fireball (322 versus 320 cubic inches), it was shorter, four inches (102 mm) lower, and lighter, but with , it was 11 percent more powerful. The compression ratio increased from 7.50:1 to 8.50:1 and torque increased from . The compact dimensions of the V-8 engine enabled Buick to reduce Roadmaster's wheelbase by across the line, although styling differences behind the engine cowl, apart from new V-8 emblem hubcaps, were largely nonexistent. Buick also introduced a new \\"Twin-Turbine\\" Dynaflow as a companion for the V-8 engine. Estimated to increase torque at the wheels by 10 percent, the new transmission provided faster and quieter acceleration at reduced engine speeds. Both power steering and power brakes were made standard. Air conditioning was a new option and, years before many other makes, a 12-volt electrical system was adopted. A new body style for 1953 was the Skylark convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and the Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado. The Skylark featured open wheel wells, a drastically lowered belt line, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster's windshield, the absence of VentiPorts and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick's 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At $5,000 only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become its own series built on a Century body. This was the last year for the Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last wood-bodied station wagon mass-produced in the United States. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at $4,031, the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall Roadmaster sales bounced back up to 79,137. 1954‚Äì1956 1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible rear 1955 Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe In 1954 Buick Roadmaster and Super shared with Cadillac and Oldsmobile 98 the new General Motors C-body, adopting the new \\"ponton\\" appearance, and the addition of \\"Dagmar bumpers\\" to the front. These were large, roomy cars, as much as five and a half inches longer in wheelbase and more than nine inches (229 mm) longer overall than in 1953. Roadmaster script was found on the rear quarters and within the deck ornament. Rear fenders had a blunted fin at the rear edge, with dual \\"bullet\\" taillamps below. A new panoramic windshield with vertical side pillars was used.\\"Owners Praise Buick Styling And Wrap Around Windshields.\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1954, pp. 106-110. Seats had chrome bands on 2-door models and rear seats had an armrest on 4-door models. The front suspension was refined and Roadmaster's horsepower was increased to 200. The pillared coupe and the Estate wagon were no longer offered as body styles. Overall sales dropped to 50,571 (which is 11.37 percent of model year production).https://www.hometownbuick.com/1954-buick/1954-buick-production/ In 1955 broad lower rear fender bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck script and hood ornament, bars on the hubcaps and gold-accented grille were added to distinguish Roadmaster. Horsepower jumped to 236, and a new variable-pitch Dynaflow, in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back up lights were now standard. Overall sales were 64,527 (which is 8.73 percent of model year production).https://www.hometownbuick.com/1955-buick/1955-buick-production/ In 1956 Roadmaster had a shallower Sweepspear that did not dip all the way to the rocker panel as on other models. Twin chrome strips graced the decklid with Roadmaster spelled out between them. Roadmaster script now appeared on the doors beneath the vent windows. Fender tip dual bombsights were standard. Two stator wheels were adopted as an improvement to Dynaflow. A brand new 4-door Riviera hardtop, proved to be the most popular Roadmaster, with 24,770 units sold and outselling the pillared sedan by more than two-to-one. Overall sales were 53,427 (which is 9.34 percent of model year production).https://www.hometownbuick.com/1956-buick/1956-buick-production/ A padded dash became standard. 1957‚Äì1958 1957 Buick Roadmaster convertible interior 1957 Buick Roadmaster Riviera 1958 Buick Roadmaster 75 Riviera coupe 1958 Buick Roadmaster 75 Riviera A lower body graced the 1957 Roadmaster with an even more panoramic windshield equipped with reverse slanted pillars. A red-filled Sweepspear lined the bodysides and a chromed rear fender lower panel filled the area between the wheelhouse and the bumper end, continuing to offer \\"Dagmar bumpers\\" at the front. A new centered fuel filler was found in the rear bumper, the ends of which the single or optional dual exhaust passed through. Roadmaster script was found within the deck and grille emblems. Two door models had a trio of chevrons on the rear quarters but the four door models had a Roadmaster emblem nestled within the Sweepspear dip. Interiors featured a padded dashboard and were broadcloth and nylon in 4-doors, nylon in 2-doors and leather in convertibles. Front hip room was 65.3-in. There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door Riviera hardtop proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this \\"sales plunge\\" was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which affected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958. For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala. In 1958 the Roadmaster could only be ordered as the well equipped Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new \\"drawer pull\\" grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For the first time since 1948 there were no distinguishing VentiPorts on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000. There was a complete restyling for 1959, but this time the names of the various series were changed. Not until 1991 would there again be a big Buick known as the Roadmaster; the largest Buick models were renamed the Electra. 1991‚Äì1996 1995 Buick Roadmaster Limited sedan left Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon 1993 Estate Wagon interior The Roadmaster name returned to the Buick line for the 1991 model year after a 33-year absence, with the third generation Buick Estate wagon becoming the Roadmaster Estate. A four-door sedan was added to the Roadmaster line for the 1992 model year, the first rear-wheel drive Buick sedan since 1985. Combined sales showed an over tenfold increase over '91 thanks in part to an extended production run which had 1992 models going on sale in March 1991.  Chassis  As with its precursor, the new Roadmaster Estate wagon was based on GM's full-size rear- wheel drive B platform, which was closely related to the GM C-body and D-body chassis reserved for top of the line Buicks and Cadillacs. It rode on the same 115.9-inch wheelbase in use since the wagon series was downsized from the C-body in 1977, yet was three inches shorter than the 1990 model. The Roadmaster sedan, a C-body vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the B-body for the first time in its history. Nonetheless, it stood not only as the largest Buick, a full 10\\" longer with a 5\\" greater wheelbase than the apparent top-of-the-line C-bodied Buick Park Avenue, but larger both in wheelbase (2\\") and overall length (6\\") than the K-body Cadillac Sedan de Ville.  Powertrain  The standard engine for the 1991 wagon was a 5.0-L Chevrolet small-block V8. It was replaced a year later with a 5.7-L Chevrolet small-block V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994 both received a modified version of the advanced 5.7-L sequential point fuel-injection LT1 V8, increasing output to and substantially improved performance. Derived from the 300 hp LT1 debuted in the 1992 Chevrolet Corvette, the Roadmaster version was shared both with other B-and D platform luxury and performance cars such as the Chevrolet Caprice Police Package and Cadillac Fleetwood and GM's specialty F-bodied Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. It differed in the use of iron heads for durability, camshafts tuned for increased low-end torque, and intake silencers to decrease drive-by noise (only in engines used in luxury-brand cars). While installed in part to better comply with emissions and fuel-economy standards, the LT1 V8 not only offered an 80hp power increase but raised rated fuel economy by 1 mpg, to 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway. As a result of this significantly boosted engine output General Motors limited the softer-riding Roadmaster (which ran on lower speed-rated tires than used on the Corvette) to a top speed of . For 1996, the LT1 became OBD-II compliant. All three V-8s were paired to a four-speed automatic transmission. In 1994, the hydraulically-controlled 4L60 (700R4) transmission was replaced by the electronically-controlled 4L60E. When ordered with the factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to . For the station wagon, this could be raised to 7000 pounds with the use of a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire pressure to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control. The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.  Body  The Roadmaster Estate wagon shared its body with the Caprice Estate and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser; common styling features included the Caprice's headlights and the Custom Cruiser's 2nd-row \\"Vista Roof\\" with sunroof. Simulated woodgrain sides were standard, though the treatment could be deleted for credit. All three wagons offered an optional rear-facing third-row seat, bringing seating capacity to eight. The Roadmaster sedan had a distinct fascia, featuring its own grille and headlights stacked above running lights and turn signals. It shared a formal sedan roofline with the Cadillac Fleetwood, but rode on a wheelbase nearly six inches shorter. The interior received a redesign for the 1994 model year which included new dual airbags, moving some instrument panel gauges closer to the steering wheel, and revisions to the radio and climate controls. Folding sideview mirrors moved forward from their previous location in 1995‚Äì96. The '95 Roadmaster retained its skirted rear wheels (deleted from the Caprice/Impala SS), while the sedan was updated with new bodyside moldings. Station wagons saw a shade for the Vista Roof along with a cargo cover. In 1996 automatic climate control became standard, and the rear seatbelts were redesigned with a \\"cinching\\" feature.  Discontinuation  A combination of overcrowding among Buick's high-end sedans and pressure from full-size SUVs on the Estate wagon led to both Roadmasters being discontinued after the 1996 model year; the final vehicle was produced on December 13, 1996. With Ford having eliminated its Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons in 1991, the passing of the Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate marked the end of the full-size station wagon in North America until the introduction of the Dodge Magnum in 2005. Another factor behind the discontinuation of the GM B-body line was the growth of the full-size SUV segment, which impacted both sedan and wagon sales. Additionally, a strong upswing in the longstanding body-on-frame Chevrolet/GMC Suburban offered truck-based durability, four-wheel drive, and much higher profit margins. In 1996, the Arlington Assembly facility in Texas was converted to assemble SUVs and pickup trucks, leaving the B-platform without an assembly line. It would be an entire decade before GMC capitalized on the full-sized crossover evolution with the introduction of the GMC Acadia and its derivatives sold by Buick, Chevrolet, and Saturn. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto;\\" |+Production FiguresThe Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition |- ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"Year ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"Units |- ! align=\\"centered\\"1991 |7,291 (wagon only) |- ! align=\\"centered\\"1992 |85,309 |- ! align=\\"centered\\"1993 |40,449 |- ! align=\\"centered\\"1994 |38,909 |- ! align=\\"centered\\"1995 |30,508 |- ! align=\\"centered\\"1996 |22,989 |- ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\"Total production = 225,455 |} References External links *Consumer guide to the 1991-96 Buick Roadmaster Roadmaster Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Station wagons Category:Sedans Category:Coup√©s Category:Convertibles Category:1950s cars Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States Category:Flagship vehicles Category:Luxury vehicles ","title":"Buick Roadmaster"},{"id":"1118747","text":"The GM D platform (informally, D-body), was a General Motors automobile platform designation, used in two series (1936-1984 and 1985-1996) for large body-on-frame rear-wheel drive automobiles. For the majority of its existence the D-Body represented the largest Cadillac, either the Fleetwood Series 75 or the Fleetwood Limousine. In 1985 GM downsized and redesignated its traditional large car rear wheel drive GM C platform as the new much smaller and lighter front wheel drive GM C platform. It also shifted its traditional, D platform Fleetwood limousine to the new C platform, ending production of the historic D platform. In turn, it redesignated the former RWD C platform the new D platform, and maintained production of a few RWD holdovers on it. The original D platform was closely related to GM's other two rear-wheel drive large car platforms: the mainstream GM B and the upscale C platforms. But for the limited production top-of-the-line 1936-1942 Buick Limited, the original GM D-platform was exclusive to Cadillac, GM's most luxurious brand. As GM's largest, the \\"new\\" D platform designated in 1985 was reserved to Cadillac through the end of its production in 1996.  Model History  1936-1984 original D-Body During most of the 20th century the D-Body represented GM's largest and most exclusive car platform. The D-body was used for the Cadillac Series 85 from 1936 through 1937, for the Cadillac Series 90 from 1936 through 1940, for the Buick Limited from 1936 through 1942, for the Cadillac Series 72 in 1940, for the Cadillac Series 67 from 1941 through 1942, for the Cadillac Fleetwood Series 75 from 1936 through 1976, and for the Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine from 1977 through 1984. 1985-1996 former RWD C-Body 1995-1996 Cadillac Fleetwood In 1985 GM reassigned the name of its traditional large car rear wheel drive GM C platform to its new much smaller and lighter front wheel drive GM C platform. Most of its large cars made the downsizing shift with it. However, the former C platform continued in limited use, being redesignated the \\"D platform\\" and employed by the 1985-1986 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, its direct successor 1987-1992 Cadillac Brougham, and 1993-1996 Cadillac Fleetwood, which reverted from being front-wheel drive 1985-1992 to rear-wheel drive. Compounding the confusion, the Cadillac Series 70 Fleetwood limousine, which had been built on the venerable original GM D platform (that traced its origins to 1936), was replaced in 1985 by the dramatically downsized C-platform Cadillac Series 75. This marked the end of the original D platform. Two years later the C platform Series 75 was discontinued, bringing to a close the Cadillac limousine era. Production Early designation D-bodies (1936-1984), with the exception of the Buick Limited, which was produced in Flint, Michigan, were all produced at Detroit Assembly, Detroit, Michigan. Since all Fleetwood Broughams were being produced in Detroit prior to the name change, initially all late designation D-bodies (1985-1996) were built there as well. During the 1988 model year production of D-bodies was shifted to Arlington Assembly, Arlington, Texas where it remained until the last D-bodied car was built in 1996. Production ended in 1996, leaving GM without a rear wheel drive luxury sedan. Later Cadillac introduced smaller cars on the Sigma platform. The spiritual successor of the D-Body Fleetwood is the Sedan de Ville d'Elegance which was later replaced by the Sedan de Ville High Luxury.

Early and family life Born to the wife of part-time delegate Abraham Boyd in Trigg County, he was raised and educated to some minimal extent in Trigg County. In 1832, Boyd married fellow Trigg County native Alice C. Bennett. In 1850, the widower married a widow from Pennsylvania, Anna L. Dixon.Kentucky bio Early career Boyd moved to Calloway County to farm in 1826. The next year he became Calloway County's delegate in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and served alongside his father (who represented Trigg County) in 1828-1829.Kentucky bio In 1831 Boyd moved back to Trigg County and its voters elected him to represent them in the state House. U.S. Congressman In 1833, Boyd lost his first campaign for the United States House of Representatives. In 1835 he was elected to the House and served there until 1837, when a Whig landslide resulting from the Panic of 1837 cost him his seat. Kentucky voters of the First Congressional District soon returned Boyd to the House, and he would serve from 1839 through 1855. He was a strong supporter of President Andrew Jackson. Boyd played a key role in maneuvering the annexation of Texas through Congress during the term of President John Tyler in 1845. Boyd was also important in getting the Compromise of 1850, chiefly credited to Henry Clay, passed through Congress. Largely though his prominence in shepherding the compromise to passage, Boyd was elected Speaker of the House in 1851 and held that office until 1855. While in the House, he sufficiently impressed his colleague Charles S. Benton that he named his son, the future inventor and businessman Linn Boyd Benton, after him. Later career Boyd was nominated for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but declined to run and was replaced by Lazarus W. Powell. In 1852 he moved to Paducah. He was mentioned as a candidate for Vice President of the United States at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, but was never officially nominated; the eventual nominee was fellow Kentuckian John C. Breckinridge. Kentucky voters elected Boyd the 16th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1859, but he died shortly thereafter. This became significant with the onset of the Civil War. Governor Beriah Magoffin, who supported slavery, secession and states' rights, became increasingly unpopular and distrusted as Kentucky sought to maintain a neutral course between the Union and the Confederate States of America. Unionists held a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly in summer 1861 and frequently overrode Magoffin's vetos. By August 1862 Magoffin made it clear that he was willing to resign the governorship. However, due to Linn Boyd's death, the person next in line to become Governor of Kentucky was Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk, whom Magoffin thought unacceptable. After Fisk resigned as Speaker and was replaced by James F. Robinson, Magoffin resigned. Thus, Robinson became governor and Fisk was reinstalled as Speaker of the Senate. Death and burial Boyd died in Paducah on December 17, 1859. He was buried at Paducah's Oak Grove Cemetery. Oaklands, a spacious brick home he had built in Paducah in 1852, no longer exists except as a street name.

The optional \\"d'Elegance\\" trim package that was introduced during the Fleetwood era remained available. The model received a facelift in 1990 and was replaced by an all-new Cadillac Fleetwood in 1993. History Originally used for a single horse drawn enclosed carriage for 2-4 people, the ‚ÄúBrougham‚Äù owes its name to British statesman, Henry Brougham. Cadillac first used the name in 1916 to designate an enclosed 5-7 passenger sedan body style. In the thirties, the name was given to a formal body style with open chauffeur compartment and enclosed rear quarters, metal roof and often \\"razor-edged\\" styling. When Cadillac started offering Fleetwood bodies on some of its cars in 1925, the Brougham body style was Fleetwood bodied every year with the exception of 1926. After 1937 the Brougham name was not applied to any Cadillac for the remainder of the pre-World War II period. The Brougham name would eventually reappear on the 1955 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham show car which preceded the 4-door Eldorado Brougham hardtops of the 1957 to 1960 model years. The 1957 Cadillac Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. After a five-year absence, the Brougham name reappeared as an option package on the 1965 Cadillac Sixty Special. The following year the Brougham moved up to becoming a subseries of the Fleetwood Sixty Special. This continued through 1970. Starting in 1971 the Sixty Special was only available as the well equipped Fleetwood Sixty Special Brougham. When the Sixty Special Series was retired in 1977, the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham took its place as Cadillac's largest owner-driven sedan model through 1986. The single name \\"Brougham\\" began to be used as specific Cadillac model in 1987, when the term \\"Fleetwood\\" was dropped from the former Fleetwood Brougham. It was otherwise the same as the 1986 model. The reason for the change was that Cadillac had introduced a new, smaller, front-wheel drive model in 1985 and named it simply the Fleetwood. Compounding the confusion, the optional \\"d'Elegance\\" package (introduced in the upscale Fleetwood trim line in the 1970s, offering even more luxurious appointments, including button-tufted seating and rear-seat reading lamps), was available on and appended to the names of both models, resulting in a traditional body-on- frame/rear-wheel drive \\"Fleetwood Brougham d' Elegance\\" and a unibody/transverse engined \\"Fleetwood d' Elegance\\". The solution was dropping the term \\"Fleetwood\\" from the rear-wheel drive model, leaving just the \\"Brougham\\". Since it was body-on-frame, it was popular among coachbuilders who manufactured stretched limousines, along with the similar but somewhat smaller Lincoln Town Car, as well as traditional Cadillac buyers who preferred the familiar combination of exterior size, heft, and rear-wheel drive. This was the last Cadillac to be produced without airbags.  Description 1988 Cadillac Brougham The 1987 Brougham was built at the Clark Street Cadillac Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan, as the Fleetwood Brougham had been in 1985-86. Before the shift to the Arlington Assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, some early model year 1988s were produced at Detroit Assembly in late 1987 and construction continued at Arlington through 1992. The 11th digit of the VIN indicates plant assembly. A \\"9\\" as the 11th digit indicates a Detroit Brougham; a \\"R\\" indicates an Arlington Brougham. Many of the Arlington assembled examples also had a state of Texas/GM Arlington decal on the rear side quarter glass. VIN \\"9\\" Broughams were actually produced in 1987-1990 (and in 1986 as well), and, although rare, can be found as \\"commercial chassis\\" vehicles, and generally have a higher output Oldsmobile 307 LG8 Engine and different transmissions (typically the TH400 three speed), depending on the use. Generally speaking, minor differences between 1987 and 1988 (VIN 9 and Y) can be found, such as carburetor assembly. While these cars all used Rochester Quadrajet Electronic four-barrel carburetors, differences include an electronic (Detroit) versus vacuum (Arlington) Idle Load Compensator, as well as an electronic (Detroit) versus climactic (Arlington) choke system. The vin \\"9\\" engine is the high output version of the base LV2 307 vin code Y and shares most parts with it. The HO engine is the same engine that was used in the rear wheel drive Oldsmobile 442. While the engine was not powerful, it proved to be a reliable engine with proven, but dated, technology. The Brougham wore a cross-hatch grille in 1987 and 1988 which was an identical re- cast of the 1981 grille. The Brougham received a new vertical-slat grille for 1989, which was equal to the 1982-86 with 3 horizontal sections. A 1990 facelift, the first one since 1980, was necessitated by a redesigned Town Car from rival Lincoln. For 1990, Brougham received a new digital dash cluster inside, and composite headlamps, contemporary taillamp lenses, flush bumper moldings, and an optional Chevrolet 350 V8. Additionally that year, door- mounted front seatbelts became standard in order to meet federal safety standards as no driver's side airbag was available. For 1991, the LV2 V8 was replaced by a Chevrolet FI V8 that produced , while the Chevrolet 350 produced . The 1992 models received no major changes, as it was its final year. The fuel injected engines proved to be reliable contenders and provided a tremendous power improvement over the Oldsmobile 307 carbureted engines. \\"Premier Formal Vinyl Roof\\" option 1988 Cadillac Brougham with Premier Roof option In 1988, the \\"Premier Formal Vinyl Roof\\" option became available which gave the standard Brougham a very formal look. Though costly at US$1,095, it altered the overall appearance greatly. It included a vinyl covering of not only the entire roof of the car but also the B-pillar and the rear quarter window surround. This option was available in 1988 and 1989. For 1990, a variation of roof treatment became standard in conjunction with the model's restyling that year.

The operation of those teen homes (primarily his Rebekah Home for Girls) placed him in the public spotlight.  Early ministry  Born of German descent, Roloff was reared in Dawson in Navarro County in east-central Texas. He began preaching at the age of 18. He attended Baylor University in Waco (Roloff is reported to have brought his dairy cow with him to raise tuition funds through the sale of its milk), and later Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth. After graduation, Roloff began preaching at small country churches in southern Texas before taking on pastoral duties at churches in Houston and later Corpus Christi.  The Family Altar  In Corpus Christi in 1944, Roloff began his radio show, The Family Altar. The show consists of recordings of his sermons, aired in both 15- and 30-minute programs. Roloff also incorporated singing into his sermons, and would occasionally break into impromptu singing of hymns and/or leading his choir to sing along. Each program has recordings of Roloff singing (\\"When Jesus Comes (One Sat Alone Beside the Highway)\\" at the beginning and \\"The Stranger Who Sat By the Sea\\" at the end) accompanied only by organ.  Ministry expands  In 1950, Roloff was called upon to fill in as preacher at a series of revival meetings in Corpus Christi after the scheduled speaker, B. B. Crim, died. The enthusiastic reaction to Roloff's preaching led him to resign his pastorate and pursue full-time evangelism. Roloff Evangelistic Enterprises was hence incorporated the following year. Roloff preached stridently against homosexuality,Roloff Sermons: A Renewed Mind communism, television, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, gluttony, and psychology. His strong stands led to disagreements with most of his Southern Baptist brethren. In 1956, after giving a speech at his alma mater Baylor University criticizing denominationalism, Roloff broke with the SBC and joined the Independent Baptist movement. In 1954, Roloff returned to pastoral ministry with the establishment of the Alameda Street Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, an Independent Baptist congregation. He remained there until 1961, when he resumed full-time evangelistic ministry. In 1967, he started another Independent Baptist church in Corpus Christi, Peoples Baptist Church, at which he remained until his death.  The Roloff Homes  Roloff began actively ministering to alcoholic and homeless men. His first mission house was established in Corpus Christi in 1954. Additional children's homes were eventually added throughout Texas, Oklahoma, and Georgia. The first Roloff home for females, Rebekah Home for Girls, was established in 1968, which brought in young girls who were addicted to drugs, involved in prostitution, serving jail time, kicked out of their homes, or in need of refuge. The only literature permitted to those living in the Roloff homes was the King James Version of the Bible. Television was forbidden, and only one hour of radio per day was permitted, to listen to Roloff's radio sermons. Daily church attendance was mandatory; each Roloff home had its own church and pastor on the grounds. Other policies, in accordance to the state, included windows being locked and alarm systems to prevent any truancy or escape. Contact with the outside world was denied except for monitored phone calls with parents. In addition, each dorm room had an intercom and loudspeaker. In December 2001, Texas Monthly reported on the (then closed) Rebekah Home: Some of the homes were temporarily closed in 1973 because Roloff refused on church-state issues to license the home through the state government. The institutions reopened in 1974 after Roloff successfully appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, which ruled in Roloff's favor that it was unconstitutional to close the homes down. At one point, Roloff transferred ownership of the homes from his evangelistic corporation to his church, thus compelling the state to sue the \\"new\\" owners (and restart the entire litigation) while he kept the homes running. The Attorney General refiled the case and secured an injunction that tried to shut down the ministry. In 1975, the state passed laws that required the licensing of youth homes. Roloff was arrested twice for refusing to comply with this law. In 1979, in an incident known as the \\"Christian Alamo\\", Roloff urged churches and pastors across America who supported his ministry to come to Corpus Christi and form a human chain around the church to prevent the Texas Department of Human Resources from removing children from the homes. Even after his death, legal battles with the State of Texas continued, and ultimately the homes were closed in 1985. However, the homes reopened in 1997 after a new law was passed that allowed faith-based institutions to opt out of state licensing requirements. The law was subject to renewal in 2001 and was not renewed at that time (primarily on the basis that, of the then 2,015 faith-based institutions operating various types of child-care facilities, only a mere seven chose the opt-out provision), whereupon the homes were once again closed.  Death  Roloff had always had a fascination with flight. He purchased his first airplane in 1954 and used it to travel between his various speaking engagements throughout the country. On November 2, 1982, the same day that the Democrat Mark Wells White, the outgoing attorney general, unseated Republican Governor Bill Clements, Roloff's plane crashed during a storm outside Normangee, Texas. Roloff and a ladies' singing trio from the home for adult women, along with another woman working at the home, were killed. White had vowed, if elected governor, to shut down Roloff's homes. The wreckage of the crashed airplane used to be a centerpiece of Roloff Park at Hyles-Anderson College, a Bible college in Crown Point, Indiana, partly named for the pastor Jack Hyles.  Roloff's legacy  Roloff is cited as a major influence on both the Christian fundamentalist homeschooling and youth movements. His final recorded sermon was preached at Tennessee Temple University in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is entitled \\"Hills that Help\\". Roloff was posthumously inducted in 1993 into the National Religious Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Roloff Evangelistic Enterprises is still in operation and the ministry continues to broadcast reruns of The Family Altar program on smaller, privately owned radio stations, and sell copies of Roloff's sermons. In 2017, the organization moved its mailing address to Fort Thomas, Arizona, and relocated its operations to a nearby Native American facility, which it opened in the early 1980s. People's Baptist Church also remains in operation, but no longer operates teenager group homes. The church now operates homes for adult men and women being treated for alcohol and drug addiction. Roloff's views on health from a biblical standpoint remain influential among some Christians today. He highly recommended raw, uncooked fruits, vegetables, eggs, and cheese, as well as fasting and drinking vegetable juice, and taught that the diet found in Leviticus chapter 11 should be followed. Other viewpoints on health included total abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, and television. Roloff also advocated for a reform of modern medicine. He once said in a sermon, \\"We're looking for a color-coded new world: a green pill for anxiety, and yellow pill for frustration, an orange pill for unhappiness, a black pill for a bad day at the office, and a white one when all else fails ... I believe that these pills are not necessary; only because there's a certain man in this country that has failed to give the right pill. The preacher has not given the gos-pill. Therefore, they're on every pill you can think of, and none of them are working.\\" References External links *Roloff Evangelistic Enterprises *Lester Roloff biography *Audio sermons by Lester Roloff *Roloff Sermons Category:1914 births Category:1982 deaths Category:American evangelicals Category:American evangelists Category:Radio evangelists Category:Evangelists Category:Baptists from Texas Category:Baptist ministers from the United States Category:Southern Baptists Category:Southern Baptist ministers Category:Independent Baptist ministers Category:American radio personalities Category:People from Dawson, Texas Category:American people of German descent Category:Baylor University alumni Category:Southern Baptist Theological Seminary alumni Category:People from Corpus Christi, Texas Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United States Category:Accidental deaths in Texas Category:20th-century poets Category:American anti-communists Category:American temperance activists Category:King James Only movement Category:American Christian creationists Category:Christian fundamentalists Category:Christian fundamentalism ","title":"Lester Roloff"},{"id":"1118764","text":"The Lake Erie and Western Railroad was a railroad that operated in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.

Jill Banner, Carol Ohmart, Quinn Redeker, Beverly Washburn, Sid Haig, Mary Mitchel, Karl Schanzer and Mantan Moreland also star. The film was released to relative obscurity, but eventually achieved cult status. Plot Three children of the Merrye family live in a decaying rural mansion with their protector and chauffeur, Bruno (Chaney). The children suffer from \\"Merrye Syndrome\\", a genetic affliction unique to members of their family, which causes them to mentally, socially and physically regress down the evolutionary ladder, starting in late childhood. Two distant relatives arrive with their lawyer and his secretary in order to examine and claim the property as rightful heirs. Bruno's shaky control over the children deteriorates; murder, chaos and insanity ensue.http://www.rickmcgrath.com/jack_hill_movies/spider_baby.html/ The siblings, Ralph (Haig), Virginia (Banner), and Elizabeth (Washburn), are inbred, demented, and dangerous. These overgrown children exhibit playful innocence mixed with brutality and feral madness. Virginia is known as \\"Spider Baby\\" because of her obsession with spiders. She stalks and eats bugs, moving with a strange and spider-like grace. She also enjoys trapping unsuspecting victims in her rope \\"web\\", \\"stinging\\" them to death using two butcher knives. After murdering an innocent delivery man (Moreland), Virginia cuts off one of his ears, which she keeps in a match box. Ralph is a sexually advanced, but mentally deficient simpleton who moves through the house via the dumb-waiter. Unable to speak, Ralph communicates with only grunts and leers. He becomes sexually aroused with the arrival of the two visiting women. The mysterious Aunt Clara, Aunt Martha, and Uncle Ned, who have regressed even further than the Merrye siblings, live in the cellar. The skeleton of the family's dead father is kept in a bedroom and is kissed goodnight by Virginia. Bruno, the children's sworn and loving protector, has been able to maintain control and keep the family secrets hidden. But when the snooping, greedy cousin Emily (Ohmart) and her brother Peter (Redeker) arrive to take possession of the property, the bizarre behavior of the Merrye clan is revealed. Peter, Emily, their lawyer Schlocker (Schanzer), and his assistant Ann Morris (Mitchel) insist on staying at the house. Dinner is served after Ralph happily kills a cat for the main course. The revolting meal includes insects, mushrooms, and a garden salad made of weeds. Virginia and Elizabeth murder Schlocker, eventually dumping his body into the basement, where the demented beastly relatives apparently eat him. Bruno leaves on an errand. Despite warning the children to \\"behave\\", events spiral downhill as the Merrye kids run amok. The basement dwellers are unleashed. Meanwhile, Emily models some black lingerie as Ralph peeks in. After being chased and then raped by Ralph, Emily becomes sexually aggressive and murderous. Bruno returns and realizes that he has lost control of the children and of their secret unsavory lives. He lights a bundle of dynamite, blowing himself, the house and the children to bits. This seems to kill all carriers of \\"Merrye Syndrome\\". Peter, who managed to escape the house with Ann, is recounting the story as the movie comes to a close. Addressing the audience, he explains that, as the sole remaining heir, he inherited the Merryes' vast family fortune, married Ann and wrote a book on the strange \\"Merrye Syndrome\\" phenomenon. He adds that his particular branch of the family was distant enough to be immune to the syndrome. However, the camera cuts to Peter's young daughter, who eerily resembles Virginia, admiring a spider in its web. Cast * Lon Chaney Jr. as Bruno (as Lon Chaney) * Carol Ohmart as Emily * Quinn K. Redeker as Peter (as Quinn Redeker) * Beverly Washburn as Elizabeth * Jill Banner as Virginia * Sid Haig as Ralph * Mary Mitchel as Ann * Karl Schanzer as Schlocker * Mantan Moreland as Messenger Production The location chosen was the (now historic) Smith Estate in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The film was shot between August and September 1964. However, due to the original producer's bankruptcy, the film was not released until December 24, 1967. Spider Baby suffered from poor marketing as well as a series of title changes, being billed alternatively as The Liver Eaters, Attack of the Liver Eaters, Cannibal Orgy, and The Maddest Story Ever Told. Although these alternate titles have little or no relation to the plot, the latter two appear in the lyrics of the title song sung by Chaney: \\"This cannibal orgy is strange to behold in the maddest story ever told.\\" The opening titles of the film also dub it Spider Baby or, The Maddest Story Ever Told. The cinematographer was Alfred Taylor, who had previously worked on the film The Atomic Brain. The entire production cost about $65,000, and took only 12 days to shoot in black and white. Home media In 1999, a DVD of the film's original laserdisc transfer was released, including a cast and crew reunion and a commentary track by Hill. In 2007, Dark Sky Films released a version featuring Hill's director's cut, a new commentary with co- star Haig and multiple documentaries on the making of the film. In 2015, British home video distributor Arrow Films released a director-approved Blu- ray/DVD combo special edition of the film. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.16/10. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of a possible four stars, calling the film \\"At its best it's both scary and funny.\\" Legacy Stage adaptations A musical version of Spider Baby played small community theaters, looking for a wider audience. It opened at the Empty Space theater in Bakersfield, California, on Halloween 2004. In October 2007, it opened in Brookings, Oregon at the local Grange Hall, and in Orlando, Florida at the Black Orchid Theater. In 2009, the musical toured with stops in Fresno, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Tehachapi and San Francisco. A 2010 tour a multi-city tour had stops in Las Vegas, Nevada; Toronto, Ontario; and Los Angeles. In 2012 it played in San Diego, California at the 10th Avenue Arts Centre as part of Gamercon and Terror at the 10th, respectively. The soundtrack for the musical version was the final project at Buck Owens' recording studio in Bakersfield. In music The film's theme song has been covered at least three times: By the band Fant√¥mas on their film-score covers album The Director's Cut, and by crossover thrash band The Acc√ºsed on 1988's Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told as \\"The Maddest Story Ever Told.\\", and by Kid Congo Powers. Remake In 2007, independent film producer Tony DiDio began preparing a remake of the film, featuring original director Hill as executive producer, and Jeff Broadstreet as director.Fangoria - America's Horror Magazine Broadstreet stated in an interview, \\"We‚Äôre going to stick very closely to the basic story of the original film, and at the same time dig deeper into the backstory of the inbred Merrye family\\". The new script by Robert Valding \\"expands on the themes of unconditional love, and also the story elements of cannibalism and the mutant relatives in the basement\\". In 2009, Spider Baby writer/director Hill and END Films launched the \\"official Spider Baby website,\\" featuring historical information about the film, director/cast biographies, video clips and photo galleries. Preservation and archival status In 2012, the film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, using the original camera negative. A new fine grain master positive, new duplicate negative and new prints were created, as well as analog and digital soundtrack masters.

The vessel entered service in 1943 and saw action during World War II and in the postwar era. In 1961 Burrfish was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy where she served as HMCS Grilse (SS 71) and was used primarily as a training boat from 1961 until 1969. Construction and career Burrfish was launched on 18 June 1943 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, sponsored by Miss Jane Elizabeth Davis, daughter of Senator James J. Davis from Pennsylvania. The boat was commissioned 14 September 1943, Commander William Beckwith Perkins, Jr. in command. Burrfishs war operations extended from 2 February 1944 to 13 May 1945 during which period she completed six war patrols, sinking one 5,894-ton German tanker Rossbach in Japanese waters on 7 May 1944 and, along with , a 200-ton patrol boat on 17 November 1944. Her operating area extended from the Western Caroline Islands to Formosa and the waters south of Japan. During her third war patrol the ship accomplished several special missions, conducting reconnaissance of the beaches of Palau and Yap where landings were planned. On 20 December 1944, prior to her fifth war patrol, Lieutenant Commander M. H. Lytle relieved Commander W. B. Perkins, Jr. as commanding officer of Burrfish. Burrfish arrived at Pearl Harbor from her last war patrol 13 May 1945. On 16 May she was ordered to return to the United States for major overhaul and arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 19 June. On 12 October 1945 she reported to New London, Connecticut, for inactivation and was placed out of commission in reserve on 10 October 1946. On 2 November 1948 Burrfish was recommissioned and assigned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for conversion to a radar picket submarine. Her designation was changed to SSR-312 on 27 January 1949 and her conversion was completed in November 1949. Burrfish returned to duty with the active fleet 7 February 1950 and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 at Norfolk. Between February 1950 and June 1956 she completed three tours with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea; participated in several major type and inter-type exercises; and operated along the eastern seaboard as a radar picket ship. On 5 June 1956 Burrfish sailed from Norfolk, Virginia to New London where she reported for inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve 17 December 1956 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  Service with the Royal Canadian Navy  The Royal Canadian Navy was interested in reestablishing its submarine service in the late 1950s and as an essential stopgap to further purchases, they sought a boat to train in.Ferguson, p. 254 The United States Navy gave them a choice from among ten boats in the Reserve Fleet and Burrfish was selected.Ferguson, p. 255 An official agreement to loan a submarine to the Royal Canadian Navy was finalized after approval by the Canadian Cabinet and ratification by the United States Congress in May 1960. The loan agreement would last for five years and would include $1,764,000 for the cost of reactivation and modification. In Fall 1960 the prospective crew was sent to New London, Connecticut for US submarine training. On 17 January 1961 the submarine was recommissioned into the United States Navy as SS-312. The sub was then decommissioned from the United States Navy on 11 May 1961 and recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at New London as HMCS Grilse (SS 71), the second vessel to bear the name.Milner, p. 228 Grilse underwent one month of sea trials before transiting to her new homeport at Esquimalt, British Columbia, arriving on 14 July 1961.Ferguson, p. 256 Having reestablished the Canadian submarine service, Grilse was acquired by the Royal Canadian Navy for use as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare training on the Pacific coast.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 267 However, the boat lacked the speed of more modern subs and her sensor and weapons outfit were not up to the task of anti- submarine warfare. As a result, Grilse spent most of her time as \\"clockwork mice\\" for surface ships and aircraft, as a passive target for their training.Ferguson, p. 257 The submarine participated in joint Royal Canadian Navy/Royal Canadian Air Force and joint US/Canada training exercises in the Pacific. In May 1966, her five-year loan was renewed for $1 million, and the sub underwent a refit in 1967 for $1.2 million.Ferguson, p. 272Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 48 In Spring 1968, Grilse was sent on a training cruise to Japan. Once there, the boat trained with units of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and the United States Navy.Ferguson, p. 258 In 1968, the Canadian Navy, now called Maritime Command, was offered a more modern by the US. Maritime Command chose to accept the offer and was purchased as a direct replacement for Grilse on the west coast.Ferguson, p. 273Milner, p. 257 With the arrival of Rainbow, Grilse never sailed again. Some of Grilses more modern gear was taken out and transferred to Rainbow, however Grilse had to remain operationally capable in accordance with the loan agreement and the transfer was limited. The sub returned to the US in September 1969. The boat was struck from the Naval Register on 19 July 1969. Grilse was officially paid off from Maritime Command on 2 October 1969 and returned to the US Navy the same day. Burrfish was sunk as a target off San Clemente Island, California, on 19 November 1969.  Research  Grilse was also used as a test platform for measuring the nature of turbulence, the results of which were analyzed by scientists that included French polymath Benoit Mandelbrot, whose thinking on fractals was substantially shaped by this experience: > \\"On a visit to Vancouver, I asked to listen to the recordings. Not possible, > I was told; the audio tapes, while playable, spanned too broad a frequency > spectrum from high pitch to low, most of them outside human earshot. But > surely, I said, you can speed up and slow down the tape? I insisted. And, > after some fumbling with the then-primitive equipment, they obliged me. We > sat and listened. Just listened.

Wrangler has partnered with Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) to ensure all apparel is made in a sustainable and ethical way.https://wrangler.com.au/blog-article/?cid=commitment-to-the-environment History Wrangler Jeans were first made by the Blue Bell Overall Company, which had acquired the brand when it took over Casey Jones in the mid-1940s. Blue Bell employed Bernard Lichtenstein (\\"Rodeo Ben\\"), a Polish tailor from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ who worked closely with cowboys, to help design jeans suitable for rodeo use. He convinced several well-known rodeo riders of the time to endorse the new design. The 13MWZ style, short for the thirteenth version of men's jeans with zipper, was introduced in 1947. This model is still available and the company has since introduced several other lines that are more designated towards a specific group or demographic. Examples include 20X, Riggs, and Aura. Wrangler also exports its goods to many countries, with Europe and Australia being some of its main export markets. Wrangler also has a line of music accessories targeted toward country music fans.

It features large department stores as well as restaurants, souvenir sellers, general retail establishments, and street vendors. The Downtown Crossing MBTA station lies in the center of the district. The district gets its name from the intersection of Washington Street with Winter and Summer Streets. Historically, the district was anchored by two department stores, Jordan Marsh and Filene's which stood opposite each other at the intersection. While both stores have since been bought by other chains and no longer exist, the district continues to be a major pedestrian shopping area, with the area of Washington, Winter, and Summer streets surrounding the intersection closed to most vehicular traffic; pedestrians may walk freely in the street. History Early history In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Summer Street was an upscale neighborhood, with townhouses designed by Charles Bulfinch and others.Shopping at Downtown Crossing Radio Boston, 14 Aug 2009. The Great Boston Fire of 1872 destroyed much of the neighborhood, especially between Summer, Washington, and Milk Streets. Ladder District Since the early 1900s, the area along Washington and Tremont Streets, roughly from School Street to Beach Street, has also been referred to as the Ladder District. The side streets between the two main thoroughfares look like the rungs of a ladder when viewed on a map, hence the name. Department stores Between 1895 and 1917, Downtown Crossing became the hub of department store shopping in Boston. In 1841, Eben Jordan and Benjamin L. Marsh opened the first Jordan Marsh store as wholesalers, which later grew into a retail department store. Another major store, Filene's, was founded in 1881. Originally known as William Filene's Sons Co. the store expanded, opening the \\"Automatic Bargain Basement\\" in 1909. Gilchrist and Kennedy's also opened in the neighborhood, though both are now defunct. These stores attracted more middle-class visitors, including those from the suburbs, and anchored other retail services, including food and restaurants. Nationwide, downtown department stores faced challenges after World War II due to suburbanization and competition from big box stores. Filene's Basement would go on to become a major department store independent of Filene's. The flagship store of Filene's Basement was located underground, in the basement of the former Filene's department store. The two stores, formerly under the same ownership, were disassociated in 1988. The building housing the two stores was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. During the Winter Season Filene's would hold a Christmas tree lighting and Jordan Marsh would present a series festive Christmas window displays known as the \\"Enchanted Village\\". The window display has since relocated to Boston's Hynes Convention Center, and then to City Hall Plaza. Redevelopment Following the success of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Boston decided to redevelop the Washington Street area into a pedestrian-only mall, which was unveiled in 1979. At first, foot traffic and business in the area declined, but it slowly returned as the popularity of the mall as a shopping area increased, helped along by a cart vending program. The area is experiencing more growth due to new luxury hotel and condominium additions. In 2001, Millennium Place was completed. The luxury towers rise to 38 stories (475 feet) and 36 stories (446 feet). In 1996, the former Jordan Marsh store became Macy's, and in early 2006 the Filene's landmark flagship store was closed. In 2006, Vornado Realty Trust announced the purchase of the former Filenes site for $100m. The project is expected to cost around $620 million and the project would be filled with upscale shopping destinations, high- dollar business space, and tony residences. The plan calls for a 38-story tower that will rise to 495 feet. However, the vacancy left by Filene's has left the building to be redeveloped. Filene's Basement has been closed for the duration of construction, but has vowed to return upon the completion of construction. As of September 2011, Filene's Basement is still closed. Filene's Basement filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday May 4, 2009. New York‚Äôs Crown Acquisitions, with the Chetrit Group as its partner has made a bid to buy 17 of Filene's 25 locations including the Downtown Crossing location. Although construction has stalled on the Downtown Crossing project, the store is still slated to reopen in the future. The Downtown Crossing location accounted for 13% of the company's sales. Vornado Realty Trust had been paying Filene's $500,000 a month in compensation for closing their Downtown Crossing store. These payments stopped without notice in January 2009. In 2010, the Downtown Boston Business Improvement District was initiated to revive an ailing Downtown Crossing. In 2015, the historic Burnham Building (see Filene's Department Store) where Filene's flagship previously resided became occupied by Havas and Arnold Worldwide on its upper floors. In the second half of 2015, supermarket Roche Bros. and Primark, an Irish clothing retailer opened to occupy the ground floor of the Burnham Building. Suffolk University expansion In 2007 Suffolk University bought a building on West Street that was being renovated into condominiums, and converted it into a student dormitory capable of housing about 270 students. In 2010, Suffolk University renovated and restored the historical Modern Theatre and built a ten-story dormitory on top of the theater.

The linear approximation of a function is the first order Taylor expansion around the point of interest. In the study of dynamical systems, linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear differential equations or discrete dynamical systems.The linearization problem in complex dimension one dynamical systems at Scholarpedia This method is used in fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and ecology. Linearization of a function Linearizations of a function are lines‚Äîusually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function y = f(x) at any x = a based on the value and slope of the function at x = b, given that f(x) is differentiable on [a, b] (or [b, a]) and that a is close to b. In short, linearization approximates the output of a function near x = a. For example, \\\\sqrt{4} = 2. However, what would be a good approximation of \\\\sqrt{4.001} = \\\\sqrt{4 + .001}? For any given function y = f(x), f(x) can be approximated if it is near a known differentiable point. The most basic requisite is that L_a(a) = f(a), where L_a(x) is the linearization of f(x) at x = a. The point-slope form of an equation forms an equation of a line, given a point (H, K) and slope M. The general form of this equation is: y - K = M(x - H). Using the point (a, f(a)), L_a(x) becomes y = f(a) + M(x - a). Because differentiable functions are locally linear, the best slope to substitute in would be the slope of the line tangent to f(x) at x = a. While the concept of local linearity applies the most to points arbitrarily close to x = a, those relatively close work relatively well for linear approximations. The slope M should be, most accurately, the slope of the tangent line at x = a. An approximation of f(x)=x^2 at (x, f(x)) Visually, the accompanying diagram shows the tangent line of f(x) at x. At f(x+h), where h is any small positive or negative value, f(x+h) is very nearly the value of the tangent line at the point (x+h, L(x+h)). The final equation for the linearization of a function at x = a is: y = (f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)) For x = a, f(a) = f(x). The derivative of f(x) is f'(x), and the slope of f(x) at a is f'(a). Example To find \\\\sqrt{4.001}, we can use the fact that \\\\sqrt{4} = 2. The linearization of f(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} at x = a is y = \\\\sqrt{a} + \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\sqrt{a}}(x - a), because the function f'(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\sqrt{x}} defines the slope of the function f(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} at x. Substituting in a = 4, the linearization at 4 is y = 2 + \\\\frac{x-4}{4}. In this case x = 4.001, so \\\\sqrt{4.001} is approximately 2 + \\\\frac{4.001-4}{4} = 2.00025. The true value is close to 2.00024998, so the linearization approximation has a relative error of less than 1 millionth of a percent. Linearization of a multivariable function The equation for the linearization of a function f(x,y) at a point p(a,b) is: f(x,y) \\\\approx f(a,b) + \\\\left. {\\\\frac} \\\\right|_{a,b} (x - a) + \\\\left. {\\\\frac} \\\\right|_{a,b} (y - b) The general equation for the linearization of a multivariable function f(\\\\mathbf{x}) at a point \\\\mathbf{p} is: f({\\\\mathbf{x}}) \\\\approx f({\\\\mathbf{p}}) + \\\\left. { abla f} \\\\right|_{\\\\mathbf{p}} \\\\cdot ({\\\\mathbf{x}} - {\\\\mathbf{p}}) where \\\\mathbf{x} is the vector of variables, and \\\\mathbf{p} is the linearization point of interest .Linearization. The Johns Hopkins University. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Uses of linearization Linearization makes it possible to use tools for studying linear systems to analyze the behavior of a nonlinear function near a given point. The linearization of a function is the first order term of its Taylor expansion around the point of interest. For a system defined by the equation :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x},t), the linearized system can be written as :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} \\\\approx \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x_0},t) + D\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x_0},t) \\\\cdot (\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x_0}) where \\\\mathbf{x_0} is the point of interest and D\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x_0}) is the Jacobian of \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}) evaluated at \\\\mathbf{x_0}. Stability analysis In stability analysis of autonomous systems, one can use the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at a hyperbolic equilibrium point to determine the nature of that equilibrium. This is the content of linearization theorem. For time-varying systems, the linearization requires additional justification. Microeconomics In microeconomics, decision rules may be approximated under the state-space approach to linearization.Moffatt, Mike. (2008) About.com State-Space Approach Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008. Under this approach, the Euler equations of the utility maximization problem are linearized around the stationary steady state. A unique solution to the resulting system of dynamic equations then is found. Optimization In mathematical optimization, cost functions and non-linear components within can be linearized in order to apply a linear solving method such as the Simplex algorithm. The optimized result is reached much more efficiently and is deterministic as a global optimum. Multiphysics In multiphysics systems‚Äîsystems involving multiple physical fields that interact with one another‚Äîlinearization with respect to each of the physical fields may be performed. This linearization of the system with respect to each of the fields results in a linearized monolithic equation system that can be solved using monolithic iterative solution procedures such as the Newton-Raphson method. Examples of this include MRI scanner systems which results in a system of electromagnetic, mechanical and acoustic fields.

It developed at 4100 rpm (52.5 bhp in the case of the PE) giving the car a maximum speed of and a 0- time of 13.4 seconds. Two Zenith carburettors were fitted and PA and PB versions had hydraulic tappets. The radiator was behind the engine. A four- speed gearbox with column change was used. Early cars had gearboxes made by the Henry Meadows company. Later, Jowett made the gearboxes, but the decision to make the gearboxes in-house proved to be a costly mistake.Images of Motoring: Jowett by Noel Stokoe () Even though Jowett had some experience in transmission manufacturing, the project went disastrously wrong; powertrainless bodies stacked up in the assembly line because of problems in gearbox production. The horizontally opposed engine is very low immediately behind the grille and in front of the radiator Design features Design features included aerodynamic styling with the headlights faired into the wings and, for the time, a steeply sloped, curved windscreen. The body was of pressed steel, incorporating a box-section chassis, and was made for Jowett by Briggs Motor Bodies in their Doncaster factory. The suspension used torsion- bars on all wheels (independent at the front) and internal gear-and-pinion steering. PA and PB models had mixed Girling hydraulic brakes at the front and mechanical braking at the rear. Later versions were fully hydraulic.

It is a sequel to Crocodile Dundee (1986) and was followed by Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (2001). Actors Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski reprise their roles as Mick Dundee and Sue Charlton, respectively, here shown opposing a Colombian drug cartel. The film was directed by John Cornell and shot on location in New York City and Northern Territory, Australia. It cost $14 million to make.TV Week magazine, 4 June 1988, page 11. \\"Box office war\\" by Ivor Davis. Plot A year has passed since the events of Crocodile Dundee, and Mick Dundee and Susan \\"Sue\\" Charlton are living happily together in New York. Although Mick's ignorance of city life is a hazard when he attempts to continue his former lifestyle, like blast fishing in Manhattan's waters, Sue's writing has made him a popular public figure. He later goes to work for Leroy Brown, a mild-mannered stationery salesman trying to live up to his self-perceived 'bad guy in the streets' image. While working for the DEA in Colombia, Sue's ex-husband Bob (mentioned, but not seen, in the first movie) takes photographs of a drug cartel leader's murder of an unknown person, and is spotted by one of the cartel's sentries. He sends the photographs to Sue before being murdered himself. Colombian Cartel leader Luis Rico and his brother and top lieutenant, Miguel, go to New York City to retrieve the photos. The gangsters take Sue hostage, leading Mick to ask Leroy for help. Leroy contacts a local street gang, whom Mick asks to create a distraction by caterwauling at the mansion's perimeter, leading most of the cartel's guards on a wild goose chase while Mick rescues Sue. Rico goes into hiding to avoid arrest, and after his henchmen fail a subsequent attempt to kill Sue, Mick decides to take Sue to Australia to fight on familiar ground. In Walkabout Creek, Mick is enthusiastically welcomed back by friends. After provisioning, he and Sue take refuge on his personal land, named Belonga Mick ('Mick's Place'; see bilong in Tok Pisin). Here, Sue discovers that Mick legally owns land almost twice the size of New York State, including a gold mine. Rico and his men track their quarry to Australia, where they hire some local thugs to assist them, but their Aboriginal tracker abandons them when he hears that their quarry is Mick (the implication being that Mick is a good and respected friend of his). The gangsters then take Mick's friend Walter as a hostage, but Mick saves his friend by faking an attempt on Walter's life. Walter convinces the gangsters that Mick's failed attack was due to Walter being the only person suitable to guide them, so they take him as a replacement tracker. He then leads the gangsters on a false trail through the Outback territory, during which Mick, with the help of his Aboriginal friends that he summoned with a bullroarer, manages to reduce the opposition's numbers one by one, leaving the rest increasingly nervous. In the end, he retrieves Walter from Rico and Miguel, leaving the latter to face him alone. Tired of chasing Dundee, Rico sets a bushfire to corner Mick, but Mick regains the upper hand, captures Rico, and switches clothes with him to lure Miguel into a vulnerable position. Sue and Walter, observing them from a distance, mistake Mick for Rico and take shots at him. Walter shoots Mick, though not fatally, and Rico tries to escape but is shot by Miguel (who mistakes him for Mick). Rico loses his balance and falls to his death in an escarpment. Miguel is, in turn, shot and killed by Sue. Though thinking at first that Mick is dead, they soon re-unite with him (Walter's bullet had only hit Mick in the side), and Sue and Mick embrace. When Mick asks her whether she is ready to go home, Sue replies \\"I am home\\", concluding the film. Cast * Paul Hogan as Michael J.

It was a lighter-weight horse, usually a smooth gaited one that could amble, suitable for riding over long distances. Palfreys were not a specific breed as horse breeds are understood today. Etymology The word \\"palfrey\\" is cognate with the German word for a horse (of any type), Pferd. Both descend from Latin, paraveredus, meaning a post horse or courier horse. The German term for a palfrey, meanwhile, is Zelter, which literally means ambler and is cognate with the Icelandic, t√∂lt. Breeding A palfrey usually was the most expensive and highly bred type of riding horse during the Middle Ages,Davis, R.H.C. (1989). The Medieval Warhorse: Origin, Development and Redevelopment, p 137 (). sometimes equalling the knight's destrier in price. Consequently, it was popular with nobles, ladies, and highly ranked knights for riding, hunting, and ceremonial use.Oakeshott, Ewart. A Knight and his Horse, Rev. 2nd Ed. USA:Dufour Editions, 1998. Gait The palfrey was considered an appropriate mount for women The significant characteristic of the palfrey was that, rather than trotting, it usually possessed a smooth, ambling gait.Bennett, Deb. Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship. Amigo Publications Inc; 1st edition 1998. The amble was the name given to a group of smooth, four-beat gaits faster than a walk, but slower than a canter or gallop. The trot is a two-beat gait, about 8 mph, suitable for covering a lot of ground relatively quickly. However, the horse also has a bit of a spring in its motion as it switches diagonal pairs of legs with each beat, and thus can be rough for a rider, and the trot also jostles about packs or weaponry to a considerable degree. The amble is about as fast as the trot, not tiring for a horse that performs it naturally, and much smoother for the rider. Thus, because much ground transportation in the Middle Ages was on horseback, with long distances to be covered, a smooth-gaited horse was much desired. An amble is achieved by the horse when it moves with a four-step rhythm, either derived from the two- beat lateral gait known as the pace or from the diagonal trot, with the two beats broken up so there are four. There are several variations, but most either have a lateral sequence of footfalls (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), or a diagonal sequence (left hind, right front, right hind, left front). In either case, only one foot is all the way off the ground at a time. Such a gait can be maintained for long distances, and sometimes at considerable speed. Modern genetic studies have verified that ambling ability is linked to a specific genetic mechanism. Image of a palfrey in ambling gait Ambling horses are now uncommon in Europe. They were effectively replaced by trotting horses for several reasons: The first was that as roads improved, travel by carriage became more common, and trotting horse breeds were generally larger and stronger, more suited to the job at hand. Another reason was the rise of the Thoroughbred and other breeds developed for horse racing and for light cavalry, both of which required horses able to gallop for substantial periods of time. Breeds swift at the gallop also tend to trot rather than pace or amble. In the Americas, ambling horses continued to be bred, both in the southern United States and in Latin America. The smooth ambling gaits today have many names, including the single-foot, the stepping pace, the tolt, the rack, the paso corto, and the fox trot (see ambling). There are still many ambling breeds, particularly in North America where today they are referred to as gaited horses. Some of these breeds include the Missouri Fox Trotter, Tennessee Walking Horse, Icelandic horse and a sub-group within the American Saddlebred. The Paso Fino and the Peruvian Paso, breeds developed in Latin America, perform two or three different ambling gaits of varying speed, and are probably the closest modern descendants of the medieval palfrey.

The film was directed by Ron Howard, who assisted in developing the story with screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. Much of it is based on the family and parenting experiences of Howard, Ganz, Mandel, and producer Brian Grazer, who have at least 17 children among the four of them. Principal photography was filmed in and around Orlando, Florida with some scenes filmed at the University of Florida. It was nominated for two Academy Awards: Dianne Wiest for Best Supporting Actress and Randy Newman for Best Song for \\"I Love to See You Smile\\". The film was adapted into a NBC television series in 1990 and 2010. While the first series was canceled after one season, the second series ran for six seasons. Plot Gil Buckman, a St Louis sales executive, is trying to balance his family and his career. When he finds out that his eldest son, Kevin, has emotional problems and needs therapy and that his two younger children, Taylor and Justin, both have issues as well, he begins to blame himself and questions his abilities as a father. When his wife, Karen, becomes pregnant with their fourth child he is unsure he can handle it. Gil is also frustrated and fearful that the financial burdens of another child and office politics at work are turning him into the detached workaholic he despised his own father, Frank, for being. Humbled by family and work issues, Gil opens up to Frank about his doubts as a parent. Frank tells him that he worries too much, and they have a reconciliation of sorts with Frank telling Gil that worry for one's children never ends. Gil's older sister, Helen, is a divorced bank manager whose wealthy good-for-nothing ex-husband wants nothing to do with their kids, Garry and Julie, and spends more time with his own second family. Garry, who has just entered puberty, is quiet and withdrawn and likes to be alone in his room with a mysterious paper bag. At first Helen worries that it contains drugs or alcohol, but it actually contains pornography. Julie is still in high school, but is not interested in her education. She and her boyfriend, Tod Higgins, get married, she becomes pregnant, and Tod moves into Helen's house. Helen asks Tod to talk with Garry believing he would be more comfortable confiding to another male. Tod is able to reassure Garry that his obsession with girls and sex is normal for a boy his age, to Garry's relief. This also increases Helen's respect for Tod. Eventually she supports Tod and Julie's relationship to the extent that when Julie wants to break up with Tod, Helen orders her to face her fears and work on their relationship. Helen also starts dating Garry's science teacher, giving Garry a father figure he has long been without. Gil and Helen's younger sister, Susan, is a middle school teacher married to scientist and researcher Nathan Huffner. They have a precocious daughter, Patty. Susan wants more children but Nathan is more interested in Patty's cognitive development. Susan lashes out by eating junk food and compromises her diaphragm as a plan to get pregnant against Nathan's wishes. She eventually gets so frustrated that she leaves Nathan, who eventually comes to one of her classes and serenades her to win her back promising her he will try to change. She agrees to move back home. Second youngest Larry, is the black sheep of the family but is Frank's favorite. Rather than settle into a career, he has drifted through life trying to cash in on get-rich-quick schemes. He has recently shown up along with his biracial son, Cool (the result of a brief affair with a Las Vegas showgirl), asking to borrow money from Frank. It soon becomes apparent that he needs it to pay off gambling debts ($26,000 worth) or he will be killed. Frank is disillusioned but still loves him and tries to help. Frank refuses to bail him out completely, but offers to teach him the family business so he can take over for Frank who has to put off retirement to pay off the debt. However, Larry instead suggests another get-rich-quick scheme which involves him going to Chile. Frank agrees to look after Cool knowing that Larry will most likely never return. The family is reunited at the hospital when Helen gives birth to a daughter. Frank holds Cool. Tod and Julie are together, raising their son. Susan is visibly pregnant. Gil and Karen are now the parents of four. Cast Release Box office The film opened at in its opening weekend, earning $10million. It eventually grossed over $100million domestically and $126million worldwide. Critical reception The film received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 91% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating, based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Bolstered by a delightful cast, Parenthood is a funny and thoughtfully crafted look at the best and worst moments of family life that resonates broadly.\\" On Metacritic, it holds a score of 82 out of 100, based on 17 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Dianne Wiest for Best Supporting Actress and Randy Newman for Best Song for \\"I Love to See You Smile\\". It was also nominated by the American Film Institute for their 100 Years...100 Laughs series.\\"AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs Nominees\\". American Film Institute (AFI). Retrieved January 26, 2014. Television adaptations The film was adapted twice to TV: as a 1990 series and again in 2010. 1990 series Parenthood was one of several failed movie-to-TV adaptations in the 1990‚Äì91 season, also including Baby Talk on ABC's TGIF (a follow up to Look Who's Talking), Ferris Bueller on NBC and Uncle Buck on CBS.Carter, Bill. It ran for 12 episodes and was not renewed for a second season. 2010 series In April 2009, filming began on a new television adaptation loosely based on the film. Craig T.

The use of \\"arbitrarily\\" often occurs in the context of real numbers (and its subsets thereof), though its meaning can differ from that of \\"sufficiently\\" and \\"infinitely\\".  Examples  The statement : \\"f(x) is non- negative for arbitrarily large x.\\" is a shorthand for: : \\"For every real number n, f(x) is non-negative for some value of x greater than n.\\" In the common parlance, the term \\"arbitrary long\\" is often used in the context of sequence of numbers. For example, to say that there are \\"arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers\\" does not mean that there exists any infinitely long arithmetic progression of prime numbers (there is not), nor that there exists any particular arithmetic progression of prime numbers that is in some sense \\"arbitrarily long\\". Rather, the phrase is used to refer to the fact that no matter how large a number n is, there exists some arithmetic progression of prime numbers of length at least n.4 Arbitrarily Large Data. Accessed 21 February 2012 Similar to arbitrary large, one can also define the phrase \\"P(x) holds for arbitrarily small real numbers\\", as follows: :\\\\forall \\\\epsilon \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}_{+},\\\\, \\\\exists x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} : |x|<\\\\epsilon \\\\land P(x) In other words: : However small a number, there will be a number x smaller than it such that P(x) holds.  Arbitrarily large vs. sufficiently large vs. infinitely large  While similar, \\"arbitrarily large\\" is not equivalent to \\"sufficiently large\\". For instance, while it is true that prime numbers can be arbitrarily large (since there are infinitely many of them due to Euclid's theorem), it is not true that all sufficiently large numbers are prime. As another example, the statement \\"f(x) is non-negative for arbitrarily large x.\\" could be rewritten as: :\\\\forall n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\mbox{, } \\\\exists x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\mbox{ such that } x > n \\\\land f(x) \\\\ge 0 However, using \\"sufficiently large\\", the same phrase becomes: :\\\\exists n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\mbox{ such that } \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\mbox{, } x > n \\\\Rightarrow f(x) \\\\ge 0 Furthermore, \\"arbitrarily large\\" also does not mean \\"infinitely large\\". For example, although prime numbers can be arbitrarily large, an infinitely large prime number does not exist‚Äîsince all prime numbers (as well as all other integers) are finite. In some cases, phrases such as \\"the proposition P(x) is true for arbitrarily large x\\" are used primarily for emphasis, as in \\"P(x) is true for all x, no matter how large x is.\\" In these cases, the phrase \\"arbitrarily large\\" does not have the meaning indicated above (i.e., \\"however large a number, there will be some larger number for which P(x) still holds.\\"). Instead, the usage in this case is in fact logically synonymous with \\"all\\".

Overview  Soil classification is a dynamic subject, from the structure of the system itself, to the definitions of classes, and finally in the application in the field. Soil classification can be approached from the perspective of soil as a material and soil as a resource.  Engineering  Engineers, typically geotechnical engineers, classify soils according to their engineering properties as they relate to use for foundation support or building material. Modern engineering classification systems are designed to allow an easy transition from field observations to basic predictions of soil engineering properties and behaviors. The most common engineering classification system for soils in North America is the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The USCS has three major classification groups: (1) coarse-grained soils (e.g. sands and gravels); (2) fine-grained soils (e.g. silts and clays); and (3) highly organic soils (referred to as \\"peat\\"). The USCS further subdivides the three major soil classes for clarification. It distinguishes sands from gravels by grain size, and further classifying some as \\"well-graded\\" and the rest as \\"poorly-graded\\". Silts and clays are distinguished by the soils' Atterberg limits, and separates \\"high-plasticity\\" from \\"low-plasticity\\" soils as well. Moderately organic soils are considered subdivisions of silts and clays, and are distinguished from inorganic soils by changes in their plasticity properties (and Atterberg limits) on drying. The European soil classification system (ISO 14688) is very similar, differing primarily in coding and in adding an \\"intermediate-plasticity\\" classification for silts and clays, and in minor details. Other engineering soil classification systems in the United States include the AASHTO Soil Classification System, which classifies soils and aggregates relative to their suitability for pavement construction, and the Modified Burmister system, which works similarly to the USCS, but includes more coding for various soil properties. A full geotechnical engineering soil description will also include other properties of the soil including color, in-situ moisture content, in-situ strength, and somewhat more detail about the material properties of the soil than is provided by the USCS code. The USCS and additional engineering description is standardized in ASTM D 2487.  Soil science  Soil texture triangle showing the USDA classification system based on grain size For soil resources, experience has shown that a natural system approach to classification, i.e. grouping soils by their intrinsic property (soil morphology), behaviour, or genesis, results in classes that can be interpreted for many diverse uses. Differing concepts of pedogenesis, and differences in the significance of morphological features to various land uses can affect the classification approach. Despite these differences, in a well-constructed system, classification criteria group similar concepts so that interpretations do not vary widely. This is in contrast to a technical system approach to soil classification, where soils are grouped according to their fitness for a specific use and their edaphic characteristics. Natural system approaches to soil classification, such as the French Soil Reference System (R√©f√©rentiel p√©dologique fran√ßais) are based on presumed soil genesis. Systems have developed, such as USDA soil taxonomy and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, which use taxonomic criteria involving soil morphology and laboratory tests to inform and refine hierarchical classes. Another approach is numerical classification, also called ordination, where soil individuals are grouped by multivariate statistical methods such as cluster analysis. This produces natural groupings without requiring any inference about soil genesis. In soil survey, as practiced in the United States, soil classification usually means criteria based on soil morphology in addition to characteristics developed during soil formation. Criteria are designed to guide choices in land use and soil management. As indicated, this is a hierarchical system that is a hybrid of both natural and objective criteria. USDA soil taxonomy provides the core criteria for differentiating soil map units. This is a substantial revision of the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy which was a strictly natural system. The USDA classification was originally developed by Guy Donald Smith, former director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's soil survey investigations. Soil taxonomy based soil map units are additionally sorted into classes based on technical classification systems. Land Capability Classes, hydric soil, and prime farmland are some examples. The European Union uses the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), currently the Update 2015 of the third edition 2014 (see the list of soils there). Previously, the earlier editions of the WRB were used. According to the first edition of the WRB (1998), the booklet \\"Soils of the European Union\\" was published by the former Institute of Environment and Sustainability (now: Land Resources Unit, European Soil Data Centre/ESDAC). In addition to scientific soil classification systems, there are also vernacular soil classification systems. Folk taxonomies have been used for millennia, while scientifically based systems are relatively recent developments.Soil classification systems . Url last accessed 2006-04-18 Knowledge on the spatial distribution of soils has increased dramatically. SoilGrids is a system for automated soil mapping based on models fitted using soil profiles and environmental covariate data. On a global scale, it provides maps at 1.00‚Äì0.25 km spatial resolution. Whether sustainability might be the ultimate goal for managing the global soil resources, these new developments require studied soils to be classified and given its own name. OSHA The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires the classification of soils to protect workers from injury when working in excavations and trenches. OSHA uses 3 soil classifications plus one for rock, based primarily on strength but also other factors which affect the stability of cut slopes: * : natural solid mineral matter that can be excavated with vertical sides and remain intact while exposed. * - cohesive, plastic soils with unconfined compressive strength greater than 1.5 ton per square foot (tsf)(144 kPa), and meeting several other requirements (which induces a lateral earth pressure of 25 psf per ft of depth) * - cohesive soils with unconfined compressive strength between 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) and 1.5 tsf (144 kPa), or unstable dry rock, or soils which would otherwise be Type A (lateral earth pressure of 45 psf per ft of depth) * - granular soils or cohesive soils with unconfined compressive strength less than 0.5 tsf (48 kPa) or any submerged or freely seeping soil or adversely bedded soils (lateral earth pressure of 80 psf per ft of depth) * - A subtype of Type C soil, though is not officially recognized by OSHA as a separate type, induces a lateral earth pressure of 60 psf per ft of depth Each of the soil classifications has implications for the way the excavation must be made or the protections (sloping, shoring, shielding, etc.) that must be provided to protect workers from collapse of the excavated bank.

Background and education Born in Paris, Maugham was the second son of Robert Ormond Maugham, a solicitor, by his wife, Edith, daughter of Major Charles Snell. The author W. Somerset Maugham was his younger brother. His grandfather, Robert Maugham, was one of the founders of the Law Society. He was educated at Dover College and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He rowed for the winning Cambridge crew in the 1888 Boat Race and was also in the winning Trinity Hall Boat Club coxless four which won the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta that year. He was in the winning Cambridge crew in the Boat Race again in 1889. He also became President of the Cambridge Union Society in Lent Term 1889. Political and legal career Lord Maugham painted in 1939 by Reginald Grenville Eves Maugham was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1890, and embarked upon a legal career, becoming a King's Counsel in 1913. In 1922, he briefly considered entering politics as a Conservative Member of Parliament but could not find a seat. He was a Judge of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) from 1928 to 1934 and a Lord Justice of Appeal from 1934 to 1935. He was knighted in 1928 and sworn of the Privy Council in 1934. The following year he became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, was created a life peer on 7 October 1935 and entered the House of Lords as Baron Maugham, of Hartfield in the County of Sussex. Three years later he was offered the position of Lord Chancellor by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Such was Maugham's lack of political experience that Chamberlain and he had never met before. He was offered the role because there were very few obvious available choices amongst the ranks of parliamentary supporters of the National Government to replace the ailing Lord Hailsham‚Äîfor the obvious successor, Sir Thomas Inskip, could not be moved from the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence. As Maugham was already 71 years old it was widely expected that he would prove to be a mere stop-gap appointment, to be succeeded by Inskip as soon as it was possible for the latter to leave Defence. However, by the time this occurred in early 1939, Chamberlain was sufficiently impressed with Maugham's work to offer to retain him, whilst allowing Inskip the opportunity to defer choosing between becoming Lord Chancellor and remaining in the House of Commons with the possibility of becoming Prime Minister (a choice that Hailsham had always regretted) and intended to make a change at the next general election, which was expected to take place that year. However, war intervened and Chamberlain carried out a full-scale reconstruction of his government. As part of this Maugham was allowed to retire, to be finally succeeded by Inskip, who was ennobled as Viscount Caldecote. Maugham took the retirement honour, of being created Viscount Maugham, of Hartfield in the County of Sussex on 22 September 1939, which, unlike his barony, was hereditary. He again served as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary until 1941. Family Maugham married Helen Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Romer, in 1896.G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.

He wrote about his father in two volumes of autobiography, Escape from the Shadows (1970) and Search for Nirvana (1977). Lady Maugham died in October 1950, aged 78. Lord Maugham survived her by seven years, dying in March 1958, aged 91. He is buried in the grounds of the parish church in Hartfield, East Sussex, alongside his wife and son.

In chemistry, a carbene is a molecule containing a neutral carbon atom with a valence of two and two unshared valence electrons. The general formula is R-(C:)-R' or R=C: where the R represent substituents or hydrogen atoms. The term \\"carbene\\" may also refer to the specific compound H2C:, also called methylene, the parent hydride from which all other carbene compounds are formally derived. Carbenes are classified as either singlets or triplets, depending upon their electronic structure. Most carbenes are very short lived, although persistent carbenes For detailed reviews on stable carbenes, see: (a) (b) are known. One well- studied carbene is dichlorocarbene Cl2C:, which can be generated in situ from chloroform and a strong base. Structures and bondings Singlet and triplet carbenes The two classes of carbenes are singlet and triplet carbenes. Singlet carbenes are spin-paired. In the language of valence bond theory, the molecule adopts an sp2 hybrid structure. Triplet carbenes have two unpaired electrons. Most carbenes have a nonlinear triplet ground state, except for those with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms, and halides directly bonded to the divalent carbon. Carbenes can be called singlet or triplet depending on the electronic spins they possess. Triplet carbenes are paramagnetic and may be observed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy if they persist long enough. The total spin of singlet carbenes is zero while that of triplet carbenes is one (in units of \\\\hbar). Bond angles are 125‚Äì140¬∞ for triplet methylene and 102¬∞ for singlet methylene (as determined by EPR). Triplet carbenes are generally stable in the gaseous state, while singlet carbenes occur more often in aqueous media. For simple hydrocarbons, triplet carbenes usually have energies 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) lower than singlet carbenes (see also Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity), thus, in general, triplet is the more stable state (the ground state) and singlet is the excited state species. Substituents that can donate electron pairs may stabilize the singlet state by delocalizing the pair into an empty p orbital. If the energy of the singlet state is sufficiently reduced it will actually become the ground state. No viable strategies exist for triplet stabilization. The carbene called 9-fluorenylidene has been shown to be a rapidly equilibrating mixture of singlet and triplet states with an approximately 1.1 kcal/mol (4.6 kJ/mol) energy difference. It is, however, debatable whether diaryl carbenes such as the fluorene carbene are true carbenes because the electrons can delocalize to such an extent that they become in fact biradicals. In silico experiments suggest that triplet carbenes can be thermodynamically stabilized with electropositive heteroatoms such as in silyl and silyloxy carbenes, especially trifluorosilyl carbenes. Reactivity Carbene addition to alkenes Singlet and triplet carbenes exhibit divergent reactivity. Singlet carbenes generally participate in cheletropic reactions as either electrophiles or nucleophiles. Singlet carbenes with unfilled p-orbital should be electrophilic. Triplet carbenes can be considered to be diradicals, and participate in stepwise radical additions. Triplet carbenes have to go through an intermediate with two unpaired electrons whereas singlet carbene can react in a single concerted step. Due to these two modes of reactivity, reactions of singlet methylene are stereospecific whereas those of triplet methylene are stereoselective. This difference can be used to probe the nature of a carbene. For example, the reaction of methylene generated from photolysis of diazomethane with cis-2-butene or with trans-2-butene each give a single diastereomer of the 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane product: cis from cis and trans from trans, which proves that the methylene is a singlet. If the methylene were a triplet, one would not expect the product to depend upon the starting alkene geometry, but rather a nearly identical mixture in each case. Reactivity of a particular carbene depends on the substituent groups. Their reactivity can be affected by metals. Some of the reactions carbenes can do are insertions into C-H bonds, skeletal rearrangements, and additions to double bonds. Carbenes can be classified as nucleophilic, electrophilic, or ambiphilic. For example, if a substituent is able to donate a pair of electrons, most likely carbene will not be electrophilic. Alkyl carbenes insert much more selectively than methylene, which does not differentiate between primary, secondary, and tertiary C-H bonds. Cyclopropanation Carbene cyclopropanation Carbenes add to double bonds to form cyclopropanes. A concerted mechanism is available for singlet carbenes. Triplet carbenes do not retain stereochemistry in the product molecule. Addition reactions are commonly very fast and exothermic. The slow step in most instances is generation of carbene. A well-known reagent employed for alkene-to-cyclopropane reactions is Simmons-Smith reagent. This reagent is a system of copper, zinc, and iodine, where the active reagent is believed to be iodomethylzinc iodide. Reagent is complexed by hydroxy groups such that addition commonly happens syn to such group. C‚ÄîH insertion Carbene insertion Insertions are another common type of carbene reactions. The carbene basically interposes itself into an existing bond. The order of preference is commonly: 1. X‚ÄìH bonds where X is not carbon 2. C‚ÄìH bond 3. C‚ÄìC bond. Insertions may or may not occur in single step. Intramolecular insertion reactions present new synthetic solutions. Generally, rigid structures favor such insertions to happen. When an intramolecular insertion is possible, no intermolecular insertions are seen. In flexible structures, five-membered ring formation is preferred to six-membered ring formation. Both inter- and intramolecular insertions are amendable to asymmetric induction by choosing chiral ligands on metal centers. :Carbene intramolecular reaction :Carbene intermolecular reaction Alkylidene carbenes are alluring in that they offer formation of cyclopentene moieties. To generate an alkylidene carbene a ketone can be exposed to trimethylsilyl diazomethane. :Alkylidene carbene Carbene dimerization Wanzlick equilibrium Carbenes and carbenoid precursors can undergo dimerization reactions to form alkenes. While this is often an unwanted side reaction, it can be employed as a synthetic tool and a direct metal carbene dimerization has been used in the synthesis of polyalkynylethenes. Persistent carbenes exist in equilibrium with their respective dimers. This is known as the Wanzlick equilibrium. Carbene ligands in organometallic chemistry In organometallic species, metal complexes with the formulae LnMCRR' are often described as carbene complexes. For a concise tutorial on the applications of carbene ligands also beyond diaminocarbenes, see Such species do not however react like free carbenes and are rarely generated from carbene precursors, except for the persistent carbenes. The transition metal carbene complexes can be classified according to their reactivity, with the first two classes being the most clearly defined: *Fischer carbenes, in which the carbene is bonded to a metal that bears an electron-withdrawing group (usually a carbonyl). In such cases the carbenoid carbon is mildly electrophilic. *Schrock carbenes, in which the carbene is bonded to a metal that bears an electron-donating group. In such cases the carbenoid carbon is nucleophilic and resembles Wittig reagent (which are not considered carbene derivatives). *Carbene radicals, in which the carbene is bonded to an open-shell metal with the carbene carbon possessing a radical character. Carbene radicals have features of both Fischer and Schrock carbenes, but are typically long-lived reaction intermediates. The \\"second generation\\" of the Grubbs catalysts for alkene metathesis features an NHC ligand. *N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) For a general review with a focus on applications with diaminocarbenes, see: are derived by C-deprotonation imidazolium or dihydroimidazolium salts. They often are deployed as ancillary ligands in organometallic chemistry. Such carbenes are spectator ligands that are usually very strong sigma donors, often drawing comparisons to phosphines.S. P. Nolan \\"N-Heterocyclic Carbenes in Synthesis\\" 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Print . Online . The ligands themselves, especially when they are isolated free of the metal, are sometimes known as Arduengo or Wanzlick carbenes. Generation of carbenes *A method that is broadly applicable to organic synthesis is induced elimination of halides from gem-dihalides employing organolithium reagents. It remains uncertain if under these conditions free carbenes are formed or metal-carbene complex. Nevertheless, these metallocarbenes (or carbenoids) give the expected organic products. :R2CBr2 \\\\+ BuLi ‚Üí R2CLi(Br) + BuBr :R2CLi(Br) ‚Üí R2C + LiBr *For cyclopropanations, zinc is employed in the Simmons‚ÄìSmith reaction. In a specialized but instructive case, alpha-halomercury compounds can be isolated and separately thermolyzed. For example, the \\"Seyferth reagent\\" releases CCl2 upon heating. :C6H5HgCCl3 ‚Üí CCl2 \\\\+ C6H5HgCl *Most commonly, carbenes are generated from diazoalkanes, via photolytic, thermal, or transition metal- catalyzed routes. Catalysts typically feature rhodium and copper. The Bamford- Stevens reaction gives carbenes in aprotic solvents and carbenium ions in protic solvents. * Base-induced elimination HX from haloforms (CHX3) under phase-transfer conditions. * Photolysis of diazirines and epoxides can also be employed. Diazirines are cyclic forms of diazoalkanes. The strain of the small ring makes photoexcitation easy. Photolysis of epoxides gives carbonyl compounds as side products. With asymmetric epoxides, two different carbonyl compounds can potentially form. The nature of substituents usually favors formation of one over the other. One of the C-O bonds will have a greater double bond character and thus will be stronger and less likely to break. Resonance structures can be drawn to determine which part will contribute more to the formation of carbonyl. When one substituent is alkyl and another aryl, the aryl-substituted carbon is usually released as a carbene fragment. * Carbenes are intermediates in the Wolff rearrangement Applications of carbenes A large scale application of carbenes is the industrial production of tetrafluoroethylene, the precursor to Teflon. Tetrafluoroethylene is generated via the intermediacy of difluorocarbene: : CHClF2 ‚Üí CF2 \\\\+ HCl :2 CF2 ‚Üí F2C=CF2 The insertion of carbenes into C‚ÄìH bonds has been exploited widely, e.g. the functionalization of polymeric materials and electro-curing of adhesives. The applications rely on synthetic 3-aryl-3-trifluoromethyldiazirines, a carbene precursor that can be activated by heat, light, or voltage. History Carbenes had first been postulated by Eduard Buchner in 1903 in cyclopropanation studies of ethyl diazoacetate with toluene. In 1912 Hermann Staudinger also converted alkenes to cyclopropanes with diazomethane and CH2 as an intermediate. Doering in 1954 demonstrated with dichlorocarbene synthetic utility.

It is one of the longest-running radio drama in history and one of a very few still in production in the United States. The show is aired over 6,500 times around the world, each week, on over 1,550 radio outlets and is translated and re- dramatized into eight languages on six continents. As of January 2020, over 3,600 episodes have been produced, each 30 minutes in length. Unshackled! is produced in the same way that shows during the Golden Age of Radio were produced. Shows are transcribed (recorded) live before a studio audience. An organist provides live incidental music and a sound-effects person provides sounds in real time as the show progresses. The show has retained a consistent and distinctive quality throughout its years of production, established by the 40-year tenure, from 1950 to 1990, of Jack O'Dell as producer/director. Characters and stories Each episode dramatizes the testimony of someone who converts to Christianity, sometimes involving a visit to Pacific Garden Mission, or through hearing Unshackled! on the radio. Radio episodes include the life stories of baseball-great-turned-evangelist Billy Sunday, who is a Pacific Garden Mission convert, and Dominic Mance, an international banker who became a homeless vagabond nearly overnight.

Yasa lived in the 6th century BCE in what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in northern India. Yasa was raised in Varanasi in a life of luxury. His father was a millionaire. The family home was full of servants, musicians and dancers who catered for the family's needs and entertainment. One day, when he had become a young man, Yasa awoke early and saw his female servants and entertainers asleep in a repulsive state. Disgusted by the spectacle, Yasa realised the vanity of worldly life, and left the family home muttering ‚ÄúDistressed am I, oppressed am I‚Äù and journeyed in the direction of Isipatana where the Buddha was temporarily residing after his first five bhikkhus had attained arahantship. This was five days after all of the first five bhikkhus had attained arahantship. The Buddha was pacing up and down in an open space near where Yasa was muttering ‚ÄúDistressed am I, oppressed am I‚Äù, and called Yasa over to him, inviting him to sit down. Yasa took off his golden sandals, saluted and sat down. The Buddha gave a dharma discourse, and Yasa achieved the first stage of arahanthood, sotapanna. At first, the Buddha spoke about generosity (Dana), morality (sila), celestial states (sagga), the evils of sensual pleasure (kamadinava), blessing of renunciation (nekkhammanisamsa), before teaching the Four Noble Truths. Yasa's mother had noticed her son's absence, and notified her husband, who sent horsemen in four directions to search for Yasa. Yasa's father headed in the direction of Isipatana, following the trail left by the golden slippers. When the millionaire saw the Buddha and asked him if he had seen Yasa, the Buddha asked him to sit down, and then delivered a dharma talk. After this Yasa's father became the first to take refuge in the Triple Gems, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Yasa, who was in the vicinity and had heard the talk given to his father, became an arahant. After father and son were reunited, the father invited the Buddha and the Sangha to his home for alms on the following day. The Buddha then ordained Yasa. The Buddha and his six arahants visited the home of Yasa the following day. Yasa's mother and his former wife thus became the first two female lay disciples. Upon hearing of Yasa's ordination, four of his closest friends, Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji and Gavampati followed him into the sangha and they too became arahants.

Taxonomy The black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) belongs to the order Gruiformes and the family Rallidae. There are five recognized subspecies of the black rail. The first subspecies, the eastern black rail (L. j. jamaicensis), is found in eastern North America, the Caribbean, and Central America. Nicknamed the \\"feathered mouse\\", the subspecies is partially migratory, breeding in America and wintering further south. The US Fish and Wildlife Service declared L. j. jamaicensis a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in October 2020. The eastern black rail can be differentiated from other subspecies by its gray crown and light brown nape. The second subspecies, the California rail, L. j. coturniculus, is found in both fresh and salt water marshes of California and Arizona, and is a resident species. The California rail can be distinguished from other subspecies by its shorter bill, and brown crown and upper back. The California Fish and Game Commission listed L. j. coturniculus as Threatened in 1971 due to loss of wetland habitat. The third subspecies, the Jun√≠n rail, L. j.tuerosi is only found in the marshes of Lake Jun√≠n, Peru. The Jun√≠n Rail is considered Endangered because of its incredibly limited range. The Jun√≠n Rail can be distinguished from other subspecies by its plain undertail coverts and pale legs. The fourth subspecies, L. j. murivagans, is found on the coast of Peru. This subspecies is over all paler, with white bars in the undertail coverts, distinguishing it from other subspecies. There is little information available on this subspecies The fifth subspecies, L. j. salinasi is found in Argentina and Chile, and is the southernmost subspecies. On average, this subspecies is larger than the rest. This subspecies can be distinguished from the rest by the large rufus patch on the upper back. Description The black rail is a small black bird with a short bill. Black rails usually weigh 29-39 g, are 10-15 cm in length, and have a wingspan of 8.7-11.0 in (22-28 cm).The body is dark, with white speckles along the back and wings. Both the beak and legs are dark. Adults have a red eye that appears around 3 months of age. It will often make its presence known with its distinctive ki-ki-krr call or an aggressive, presumably territorial, growl. This is primarily uttered during the night, when these birds are most vocal. The peak of vocalization is during the first two weeks of May, when breeding and courtship behaviors are also at their peak. Distribution and habitat It is found in scattered parts of North America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific region of South America, usually in coastal salt marshes but also in some freshwater marshes. It is extinct or threatened in many locations due to habitat loss. The largest populations in North America are in Florida and California. Behaviour and ecology The black rail is rarely seen and prefers running in the cover of the dense marsh vegetation to flying. Breeding This rail is territorial during the breeding season, and occasionally males will mate with two or more females. The nests of this bird are placed on the ground, in dense, swampy vegetation or in patches of flooded grass. The nests are bowl-shaped and built with vegetation loosely woven. The clutch of this bird usually consists of six to eight creamy white speckled, with reddish-brown spots, eggs. These eggs are roundish and measure around . They are incubated by both parents, taking shifts of approximately one hour each, for 16 to 20 days. The young then hatch. In 2015, the first ever breeding by black rails in South Carolina was captured through a camera study. This species was once thought to be a non- breeding visitor to the state.  Diet  The black rail is an opportunistic feeder and consumes a wide range of food. Its diet includes seeds, insects, crustaceans and mollusks. The black rail forages by feeding along the water lines after high and low tide. Threats Under the IUCN Red List, the black rail is listed as endangered with decreasing populations. The IUCN estimates there are between 28,000 and 92,000 mature individuals remaining. The largest threats to the Black Rail are habitat destruction and severe weather events. The wetland habitat that the black rail depends on has steadily declined through the last several decades, due to draining for development and conversion to agricultural land. In addition to declining populations and increasing threats, the black rail is also impacted by the lack of scientific studies available. Because of the secretive and hard to observe nature of the bird, there is very little know about them to help prevent population decline. They are preyed upon by many avian (hawks, egrets, and herons) and mammalian (foxes and cats) predators, and rely on the cover of thick marsh vegetation for protection. High tides are dangerous time for black rails, as they are quite vulnerable to predation outside the marsh.

It was only released in the United States and Canada. More so than her previous two albums, It Begins Again (1978), and Living Without Your Love (1979), and the non-album single \\"It Goes Like It Goes\\" (1980), White Heat was a distinct departure from Springfield's Los Angeles- produced radio-friendly soft rock sound, being closely identified with the new wave, synthpop sounds of the early 1980s. The album arguably contains the most diverse selection of genres to be collected on any Dusty Springfield studio album, ranging from Robbie Buchanan's ballad \\"Time and Time Again\\", orchestrated by James Newton Howard, to the aggressive hard rock of \\"Blind Sheep\\", co-written by Springfield herself. The sessions for \\"Blind Sheep\\" are the last designated sessions for Twentieth Century Fox Records in the Musician's Guild Logs. The album's opening track and only single release was \\"Donnez-Moi (Give It to Me)\\" which production wise took more than a few hints from contemporaneous synthesizer-driven pop productions by Giorgio Moroder, like Donna Summer's The Wanderer and Irene Cara's \\"Flashdance... What a Feeling\\", and British New Romantic bands like the Human League and their 1981 album Dare. Background and recording Jean-Alain Roussel lived in Montreal at the time. Springfield lived part-time in Toronto at this stage in her life; the two met through mutual friends and ended up collaborating on most of White Heat. Written by Canadian New Wave band Rough Trade's Carole Pope and Kevan Staples, \\"Soft Core\\" describes the realities of a dysfunctional relationship. \\"Soft Core\\" was cut in a single take by sheer mistake, thanks to an engineer throwing a tape machine into 'record', with composer Kevan Staples playing a grand piano. The sound of footsteps heard at the beginning of the track is, in fact, Springfield walking up to the piano for what she thought was just a rehearsal. Release In the aftermath of the disco backlash and its ensuing dramatic drop in record sales worldwide, Springfield's American label United Artists Records was bought out. 20th Century Fox Records took on the project, but by the time that the album was completed and ready for release, 20th Century Fox had in turn been sold, bought by the US arm of the PolyGram conglomerate. The release date was postponed for another six months and when White Heat finally came out, it had been relegated to the re-activated Casablanca Records, a label closely associated with disco, which in the year of 1982 didn't improve its chances of sales. Springfield later stated that she was surprised that the album came out at all: \\"Every time I made an album, the company I'd made it for would be swallowed up. They'd fire everyone that you'd worked with and the enthusiasm would disappear with them. Then I had to fire the original producer because he had put half the budget up his nose... there was a point where I began to feel that I was just some company's tax loss.\\" The British subsidiary of Polygram, a label the singer had been connected with for 25 years in various forms, declined its option to release the album in the UK; fans of Springfield's in her native country consequently had to buy import copies from the US and Canada. White Heat in its entirety was first issued in the UK in 2002 when it was released on CD by Mercury/Universal Music. Reception Reviewing the album in Record, Barry Alfonso commented, \\"Springfield's now stepped away from her earlier MOR approach and headed in a Grace Jones pop/funk direction. The results are uneven, but encouraging nonetheless.\\" He elaborated that Springfield's sensual approach to songs like \\"I Am Curious\\" and \\"I Don't Think We Could Ever Be Friends\\" was perfect, while she mishandled ballads such as \\"Losing You\\" by taking a modern approach to them instead of the emotional thrust that was her trademark sound.

Hammer cites M. Margetts: \\"A christening date for Lady Penelope Rich\\", N&Q; 238, (1993), pp. 153‚Äì54. ‚Äì 7 July 1607) was an English court office holder. She served as lady-in-waiting to the English queen Anne of Denmark. She was the sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and is traditionally thought to be the inspiration for \\"Stella\\" of Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella sonnet sequence (published posthumously in 1591).Stephen, p. 1007 She married Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick) and had a public liaison with Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy, whom she married in an unlicensed ceremony following her divorce from Rich. She died in 1607. Early life and first marriage Born Penelope Devereux at Chartley Castle in Staffordshire, she was the elder daughter of Walter Devereux, 2nd Viscount Hereford, later 1st Earl of Essex and Lettice Knollys, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and Catherine Carey, and sister of William Knollys, later 1st Earl of Banbury. Catherine Carey was the daughter of Lady Mary Boleyn by either her husband Sir William Carey, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, or her lover King Henry VIII. Her father was created Earl of Essex in 1572. Penelope was a child of fourteen when Sir Philip Sidney accompanied her distant cousin Queen Elizabeth I on a visit to Lady Essex in 1575, on her way from Kenilworth, and must have been frequently thrown into the society of Sidney, in consequence of the many ties between the two families. Essex died at Dublin in September 1576. He had sent a message to Philip Sidney from his death-bed expressing his desire that he should marry his daughter, and later his secretary wrote to the young man's father, Sir Henry Sidney, in words which seem to point to the existence of a very definite understanding. Penelope's brother, Robert, Viscount Hereford, inherited the Earldom of Essex on their father's death in 1576, and Penelope, her sister Dorothy, and younger brother Walter were entrusted to the guardianship of their kinsman Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon.Duncan-Jones, p. 182Huntingdon was the first cousin of Walter Devereux, Earl of Essex, whose mother Dorothy Hastings was the sister of Huntingon's father. In 1578Hammer, p.33 their widowed mother married the Queen's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Perhaps the marriage of Lady Essex with the earl of Leicester, which destroyed Philip Sidney's prospects as his uncle Leicester's heir,Philip Sidney's mother was Mary Dudley, Leicester's sister. had something to do with the breaking off of the proposed match with Penelope. In January 1581, she arrived at court accompanied by her guardian's wife, Catherine, Countess of Huntingdon, who was Leicester's sister and Sidney's aunt. In March 1581 Huntingdon as her guardian secured the queen's assent through Lord Burghley, Master of the Court of Wards, for her marriage with Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick). Penelope is said to have protested in vain against the alliance with Rich.Historical Dictionary of British Women p. 371 Penelope's children by Robert Rich were: *Robert Rich (1587‚Äì1658), later 2nd Earl of Warwick *Henry Rich (1590‚Äì1649), later 1st Earl of Holland *Sir Charles Rich (d. 1627), died unmarried and without issue *Lettice Rich (d. 1619), named after her maternal grandmother Lettice Knollys. Married firstly Sir George Carey and secondly Sir Arthur Lake *Penelope Rich, married Sir Gervase Clifton *Essex Rich, married Sir Thomas Cheek and had three sons and five daughters *Isabella Rich, married Sir John Smythe, son of Sir Thomas Smythe, first governor of the East India Company Poets' muse Portrait at Longleat House believed to be of Dorothy and Penelope Devereux c. 1581 Penelope Rich was considered one of the beauties of Elizabeth's court. She was golden-haired with dark eyes, a gifted singer and dancer, fluent in French, Italian, and Spanish.Duncan-Jones, p. 188 Penelope is traditionally thought to have inspired Philip Sidney's sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella (sometimes spelled Astrophil and Stella). Likely composed in the 1580s, it is the first of the famous English sonnet sequences, and contains 108 sonnets and 11 songs. Many of the poems were circulated in manuscript form before the first edition was printed by Thomas Newman in 1591, five years after Sidney's death.Wilson, p. 168. They were set by the French lutenist Charles Tessier and published in London in 1597. Whether Sidney fell passionately in love with Penelope in the years between her arrival at court in 1581 and his own marriage in 1583, or whether the \\"Stella\\" sonnets were courtly amusements reflecting fashionable poetic conceits may never be known. In her essay \\"Sidney, Stella, and Lady Rich\\", Katherine Duncan-Jones writes: Sidney died of wounds received at the Battle of Zutphen in 1586. In 1590, Penelope's brother Essex married Sidney's widow Frances, daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, and Lady Rich was much cultivated by poets and musicians during her brother's ascendancy at court in the 1590s.Duncan-Jones, p. 171 Poet Richard Barnfield dedicated The Affectionate Shepherd, his first work, which was published anonymously in November 1594, to Penelope Rich. Bartholomew Yong dedicated his translation of Jorge de Montemayor's Diana (1598) to her; and sonnets are addressed to her by John Davies of Hereford. In 1586 she was a godmother to the daughter of Nicholas Hilliard, the queen's miniaturist. Hilliard is known to have painted two miniatures of Lady Rich, in 1589 and 1590 for her brother, the Earl of Essex. He sent one to James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), and the poet Henry Constable wrote a sonnet about the portrait. Essex gave the second miniature to the French ambassador for Henry IV.Elizabeth Goldring, Nicholas Hilliard: Life of Artist (Yale, 2019), pp. 17, 223, 227. A miniature in the Royal Collection (above) may be one of these. Charles Tessier dedicated his book of part-songs in French and Italian, Le premier livre de chansons, to \\"Madame Riche\\", commending (in Italian) her musical judgement,Duncan-Jones, p. 185 and John Dowland composed \\"My Lady Rich's Galliard\\" in her honour. Love affair and charge of treason Penelope's marriage to Rich was unhappy, and by 1595 she had begun a secret affair with Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy. Lord Rich took no action during the lifetime of Penelope's brother, the powerful Earl of Essex, who became the aging Queen's favourite in the years after the death of Leicester in 1588.Sir J. E. Neale Elizabeth I Pelican Books edition 1988 p.357 But Penelope was tainted by association with her brother's plotting. Essex shocked many people, after the failure of the Earl of Essex Rebellion, by denouncing her as a traitor, and after his execution for treason in 1601, Lord Rich had Penelope and her children by Mountjoy cast out. Mountjoy, like Penelope, had been implicated in the Essex rebellion, but the Queen, who wished to show as much clemency as possible to the rebels, took no action against either of them. Lady Rich moved in with her lover, and the couple began a very public relationship. Mountjoy was created Earl of Devonshire on the accession of James I, and Lady Rich was in high favour at court. She was among the ladies who escorted Anne of Denmark on her entry to London in 1603 and served Anne as a Lady of the Bedchamber. She danced as the nymph Ocyte in Ben Jonson's Masque of Blackness on Twelfth Night 1605.Duncan-Jones, p. 186 In 1605, Rich sued for a divorce, and Penelope wanted to marry Blount and legitimise their children. In the divorce proceedings, she publicly admitted to adultery. The divorce was granted, but the requests to remarry and legitimise her children were refused. She married Blount in a private ceremony conducted by his chaplain, William Laud, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, on 26 December 1605 at Wanstead House in London. This proceeding, carried out in defiance of canon law, was followed by the disgrace of both parties, who were banished from court by King James. The couple continued to live together as husband and wife with their children until his death a few months later. Blount died on 3 April 1606 and Penelope on 7 July 1607. Penelope's illegitimate children acknowledged by Charles Blount were: *Mountjoy Blount (1597‚Äì1663), later 1st Earl of Newport *Elizabeth Blount *John Blount *Ruth Blount (1600‚Äì1694) died in Jamestown, Virginia Notes References *Duncan-Jones, Katherine. \\"Sidney, Stella, and Lady Rich.\\" In Sir Philip Sidney: 1586 and the Creation of a Legend, edited by J.

Early life  Caponigro started having interests in photography at age 13. However, he also had a strong passion in music and began to study music at Boston University College of Music in 1950, before eventually deciding to focus on studying photography at the California School of Fine Art.  Photography career  Caponigro studied with Minor White and has been awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships and three grants from the NEA. His best known photographs are Running White Deer and Galaxy Apple. His subject matter includes landscape and still life, taking an interest in natural forms. He is best known for his landscape works and for the mystical and spiritual qualities of his work. He is often regarded as one of America's foremost landscape photographers. Caponigro's first one-man exhibition took place at the George Eastman House in 1958. In the 1960s Caponigro taught photography part-time at Boston University while consulting the Polaroid Corporation on various technical research. Caponigro lived in El Rancho de San Sebastian during his time in New Mexico from 1973-1993. In 1971, his work was exhibited in group exhibition \\"Le Groupe Libre Expression : Expo 5\\", presented by Jean- Claude Gautrand, at Les Rencontres d'Arles festival, France. Caponigro's work is included in the collections of the Guggenheim, Whitney, Norton Simon Museum, New Mexico Museum of Art and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2001. Caponigro is a dedicated pianist and considers his training with music to be essential to his photographic imagery. His son, John Paul Caponigro, is a digital photographic artist.

He was educated at Charterhouse School until 1896, when his family moved to continental Europe. There he learnt to shoot and ride horses, allowing him to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. After demobilisation he worked briefly as an apprentice to an engineer in Wales before moving to London to become a barrister. Hastings joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901, and after two years of saving money for the call to the Bar he finally qualified as a barrister on 15 June 1904. Hastings first rose to prominence as a result of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend in Northumberland. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power. Following his resignation in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield to take a seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to his work as a barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 he was one of the highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952. Early life Charterhouse School, where Hastings was educated between 1894 and 1896 Hastings was born on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick's Day Hastings was named after the saint.Hyde (1960) p. 4 His father was a solicitor with \\"somewhat seedy clients\\",Hyde (1960) p. 6 and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was enough money in the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894.Hyde (1960) p. 8 Hastings disliked school, saying \\"I hated the bell which drove us up in the morning, I hated the masters; above all I hated the work, which never interested me in the slightest degree\\". He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies. By 1896 the family had hit another period of financial trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe with his mother and older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother how to shoot.Hyde (1960) p. 9 After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.Hyde (1960) p. 10 While they were in the Ardennes, Hastings and his brother were arrested and briefly held for murder. While attending a f√™te in a nearby village Archie got into a disagreement with the local priest, who accused him of insulting the French church after misunderstanding one of his comments. The brothers returned to see the priest the next day to demand an apology, and after receiving it, they began to return home. On the way there they were stopped by two gendarmes who arrested them for murder, informing them that the priest had been found dead ten minutes after they left his house. As the gendarmes prepared to take the Hastings to the police station, two more officers turned up with a villager in handcuffs. It transpired that the priest had been having an affair with the villager's sister, and after waiting for the Hastingses to leave he had entered the priest's house and killed him with a brick. The Hastingses were quickly released. Soon after this incident, the family moved from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the financial problems had ended. When they reached Brussels they found that the situation was actually worse than previously, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one worse than the one before.Hyde (1960) p. 11 Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales. After about a year and a half of work they discovered that there was no gold to be found in that part of Wales, and Hastings was informed that his services would no longer be needed. Military service and call to the Bar Hastings left the failed mining operation in 1899, and travelled to London.Hyde (1960) p. 12 Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required were that the recruit could ride and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and after two weeks of training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa.Hastings (1950) p. 33 The ship reached Cape Town after three weeks, and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers.Hastings (1950) p. 38 Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor,Hastings (1950) p. 40 the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.Hastings (1950) p. 41 Hastings was made a scout, a duty he thoroughly enjoyed; it meant that he got to the targeted farms first, and had time to steal chickens and other food before the Royal Military Police arrived (as looting was a criminal offence).Hastings (1950) p. 43 Hastings was not a model soldier; as well as looting, he estimated that by the time he left the army he had \\"been charged and tried upon almost every offence known to military law\\".Hastings (1950) p. 49 After two years of fighting, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed in 1902, bringing an end to the Second Boer War, and his regiment was returned to London and demobilised.Hastings (1950) p. 50 By the time Hastings returned, he had decided to become a barrister.Hyde (1960) p. 16 There were various problems with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, was a member of the Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of ¬£100 when he was called to the Bar ‚Äì ¬£100 in 1901 would be worth approximately ¬£ in 2015 ‚Äì and Hastings was literally penniless. As soon as he joined the Middle Temple, Hastings began saving money for his call to the Bar, starting with half a crown from the sale of his Queen's South Africa Medal to a pawnbroker.Hyde (1960) p. 17 The rules and regulations of the Inns of Court meant that a student was not allowed to work as a \\"tradesperson\\" but there was no rule against working as a journalist, and his cousin Philip Carr, a drama critic for the Daily News, got him a job writing a gossip column for the News for one pound a week. This job lasted about three months; both he and Carr were fired after Hastings wrote a piece for the paper that should have been done by Carr. Despite this, his new contacts within journalism allowed him to get temporary jobs writing play reviews for the Pall Mall Gazette and the Ladies' Field. After two years of working eighteen-hour days he had saved ¬£60 of the ¬£100 needed to be called to the Bar, but had still not studied for the examinations as he could not afford to buy any law books.Hyde (1960) p. 18 Over the next year his income decreased, as he was forced to study for the examinations rather than work for newspapers. By the end of May 1904 he had the ¬£100 needed, and he was called to the bar on 15 June. Career as a barrister The Royal Courts of Justice where Hastings taught himself how to practise as a barrister At the time, there was no organised way for a new barrister to find a pupil master or set of chambers, and in addition the barrister would be expected to pay the pupil master between 50 and 100 guineas (equivalent to between ¬£ and ¬£ in 2015). This was out of the question for Hastings; thanks to the cost of his call to the Bar, he was so poor that his wig and robes had to be bought on credit. Instead he wandered around Middle Temple and by chance ran into Frederick Corbet, the only practising barrister he knew. After Hastings explained his situation, Corbet offered him a place in his set of chambers, which Hastings immediately accepted.Hyde (1960) p. 20 Although he now had a place in chambers, Hastings had no way of getting a pupillage (Corbet only dealt with Privy Council cases) and he instead decided to teach himself by watching cases at the Royal Courts of Justice.Hyde (1960) p. 21 Hastings was lucky: the first case he saw involved Rufus Isaacs, Henry Duke and Edward Carson, three of the most distinguished English barristers of the early 20th century. For the next six weeks until the court vacation, Hastings followed these three barristers from court to court \\"like a faithful hound\\".Hastings (1950) p. 84 Finding a tenancy Sir Horace Avory, who eventually offered Hastings a tenancy At the start of the court vacation in August 1904, Hastings decided that it would be best to find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money- lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.Hyde (1960) p. 23 Hastings finished the book just before the court vacation ended, and presented the draft to Gill immediately. Gill did not offer Hastings a place in his chambers but instead gave him a copy of a brief \\"to see if he could make a note on it that would be any use to [Gill]\\". He spent hours writing notes and \\"did everything to the brief except set it to music\\",Hastings (1950) p. 90 before returning it to a pleased Gill, who let him take away another brief.Hyde (1960) p. 24 Over the next two years Gill allowed him to work on nearly every case he appeared in. Eventually he was noticed by solicitors, who left briefs for him rather than for Gill. By the end of his first year as a barrister, he had earned 60 guineas, and by the end of his second year he had earned ¬£200 (equivalent to approximately ¬£ and ¬£ respectively in 2015).Hyde (1960) p. 25 On 1 June 1906, Hastings married Mary Grundy, the daughter of retired Lieutenant Colonel F. L. Grundy, at All Saints' Church, Kensington. They had met through his uncle J. Comyns Carr's family, who had brought Hastings to dinner at the Grundys' house. After several meetings Hastings proposed, but the wedding was put off for a long time due to his lack of money. In January 1906, Hastings became the temporary secretary of John Simon, who had just become a Member of Parliament, and when he left the position Simon gave him a cheque for ¬£50. Hastings and his fianc√©e had \\"never had so much money before\\",Hastings (1950) p. 108 and on the strength of this they decided to get married. His marriage changed his outlook on life: he now realised that to provide for his wife he would need to work a lot harder at getting cases.Hyde (1960) p. 27 To do that he would need to join a well-respected set of chambers; although Gill was giving him briefs he was still in Corbet's chambers, which saw little business. Hastings approached Gill and asked him for a place in his chambers. Gill's chambers were full but he did suggest a well-respected barrister named F. E. Smith, and Hastings went to see him with a letter of recommendation from Gill. Smith was out and Hastings instead spoke to his clerk; the two did not get on, and Hastings left without securing a place. Hastings later described this as \\"the most fortunate moment of my whole career\\".Hastings (1950) p. 94 Directly below Smith's chambers were those of Horace Avory, one of the most noted barristers of the 19th and early 20th centuries.Hyde (1960) p. 28 As he prepared to return home, Hastings was informed that Chartres Biron (one of the barristers who occupied Avory's chambers) had been appointed a Metropolitan Magistrate, which freed up a space in the chambers. He immediately went to Avory's clerk and got him to introduce Hastings to Avory. Avory initially refused to give Hastings a place in the chambers, but after Hastings lost his temper and exclaimed that \\"if he didn't want me to help him it would leave me more time to myself\\", Avory laughed and changed his mind. His own chambers In 1910, Horace Avory became a judge. Hastings first found out when he read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again have to search for a tenancy at another chambers. He instead had the idea that he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money.Hyde (1960) p. 33 Despite Avory's reputation as \\"cold and hard\\" he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.Hyde (1960) p. 34 Although this was a good start, Hastings was not a particularly well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.Hyde (1960) p. 35 The Case of the Hooded Man Part of Eastbourne, where The Case of the Hooded Man took place. His first major case was \\"The Case of the Hooded Man\\". On 9 October 1912, the driver of a horse-drawn carriage noticed a crouching man near the front door of the house of Countess Flora Sztaray in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and to be married to a rich Hungarian nobleman, and assuming that the crouching man was a burglar the driver immediately called the police.Hyde (1960) p. 39 Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate, and ordered the man to come down. The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.Hastings (1950) p. 185 A few days after the murder, a former medical student named Edgar Power contacted the police, showing them a letter that he claimed had been written by the murderer.Hastings (1950) p. 186 It read \\"If you would save my life come here at once to 4 Tideswell Road. Ask for Seymour. Bring some cash with you. Very Urgent.\\" Power told the police that the letter had been written by a friend of his called John Williams, who he claimed had visited Sztaray's house to burgle it before killing the policeman and fleeing. Williams then met with his girlfriend Florence Seymour and explained what had happened. The two decided to bury the gun on the beach and send a letter to Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Powers. Powers helped the police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour that the police knew what had happened and that the only way to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.Hyde (1960) p. 40 Williams' case came to trial on 12 December 1912 at Lewes Assizes, with Hastings for the defence. Despite a strong argument and little direct evidence against Williams, he was found guilty and sentenced to death.Hyde (1960) p. 48 The case generated large amounts of publicity, as well as an appeal hearing at which Hastings demonstrated his legal skills. The case established him as an excellent barrister, particularly when it came to cross- examination. He was commended by both the initial judge, Arthur Channell, and the presiding judge hearing the appeal, Lord Alverstone, for his skill in his defence of Williams.Hyde (1960) p. 50 The advertisement this case gave of his skills allowed him to move some of his practice from the county courts to the High Court of Justice, where his work slowly increased in value and size.Hyde (1960) p. 56 The case made his name well-known and helped bring him work, but he still mainly worked on cases in the county courts.Hyde (1960) p. 54 These did not pay particularly well, and to get around this lack of money his clerk had him take on six new pupils at once. The short length of county court cases and the number of cases Hastings got meant that he dealt with up to six cases in a single day, running from court to court with his pupils in a \\"Mafeking procession\\" which he later described as \\"the forerunners of the modern Panzer division\\".Hastings (1950) p. 127 First World War Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Hastings and his family were preparing to travel to Germany for a holiday. On the day of departure he received a note from a client, which read \\"You tell me you are going to Germany. Don't go, we shall be at war within forty-eight hours\\".Hastings (1950) p. 196 Hastings heeded this warning, and remained in England ‚Äì war was declared between Britain and Germany less than two days later. Hastings himself volunteered to serve in the armed forces, but was rejected as medically unfit. Gruban v Booth His next noted civil case was that of Gruban v Booth. John Gruban was a German-born businessman, originally named Johann Wilhelm Gruban, who had come to England in 1893 to work for an engineering company, Haigh and Company. By 1913 he had turned the business from an almost-bankrupt company to a successful manufacturer of machine tools, and at the outbreak of the First World War it was one of the first companies to produce machine tools used to make munitions.Hyde (1960) p. 57 This made Gruban a major figure in a now- large market, and he attempted to raise ¬£5,000 to expand his business (equivalent to approximately ¬£ in 2015). On independent advice, he contacted Frederick Handel Booth, a noted Liberal Member of Parliament who was chairman of the Yorkshire Iron and Coal Company and had led the government inquiry into the Marconi scandal. When Gruban contacted Booth, Booth told him that he could do \\"more for [your] company than any man in England\\", claiming that David Lloyd George (at the time Minister of Munitions) and many other important government officials were close friends. With ¬£3,500 borrowed from his brother-in-law, Booth immediately invested in Gruban's company.Hyde (1960) p. 58 Booth worked his way into the company with a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became chairman of the Board of Directors by claiming that it was the only way to avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin. As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged for him to be interned.Hyde (1960) p. 60 Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.Hyde (1960) p. 61 The case of Gruban v Booth opened on 7 May 1917 in the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that on the final day the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts. While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were highly respected barristers, Booth's cross-examination by Hastings was so skilfully done that the jury took only ten minutes to find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban ¬£4,750 (about ¬£ in 2015).Hyde (1960) p. 67 King's Counsel His success in Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch his practice from the county courts to the High Court, and at the beginning of Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided to take the risk, and he was accepted later that year.Hyde (1960) p. 69 Select Committee of the House of Lords His first major case as a King's Counsel was representing a Colonel Bersey at the Select Committee of the House of Lords on the Women's Royal Air Force. Bersey was a senior officer of the Women's Royal Air Force (WRAF), and along with several other officers he had been accused of conspiring to have the WRAF Commandant, Violet Douglas-Pennant, removed from office to cover up \\"rife immorality\\" going on at WRAF camps. Lord Stanhope formed a House of Lords Select Committee to investigate these claims, and it began sitting on 14 October 1918.Hyde (1960) p. 72 Hastings took the lead in cross-examining Douglas-Pennant.Hyde (1960) p. 73 She accused Bersey and others of promoting this \\"rife immorality\\" and not having the best interests of the WRAF at heart. When cross examined, however, she was unable to provide any evidence of this \\"rife immorality\\" or any kind of a conspiracy, saying that she could not find any specific instance of \\"immorality\\" at the camps she visited and that it was \\"always rumour\\".Hyde (1960) p. 75 After three weeks the committee dismissed all witnesses. The final report was produced in December 1919, and found that Douglas-Pennant had been completely unable to substantiate her claims and was deserving \\"of the gravest censure\\".Hyde (1960) p. 74 As a result, Douglas-Pennant was never again employed by the government. Libel and divorce Sir Edward Carson KC, who led Hastings in Sievier v Wootton During his time at the Bar, Hastings was involved in a variety of libel cases and in a divorce case which significantly changed the law relating to the admission of evidence from spouses regarding the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child. His first significant libel case was Sievier v Wootton.Hyde (1960) p. 76 Robert Sievier was a well-known horse racing journalist and owner with a reputation for brushes with the law and underhanded dealings, having previously been tried for blackmail and acquitted on a technicality.Hyde (1960) p. 78 In 1913 he accused Richard Wootton, a noted trainer of racehorses, of ordering his jockeys to withdraw from races if he had bet on another horse so as to allow him to make large amounts of money. Wootton sued him for libel and won, but was granted only a symbolic farthing in damages because the jury thought that Sievier had not intended to cause harm. As a result of this pyrrhic victory, Wootton held a grudge against Sievier for many years. As revenge, Wootton wrote a pamphlet titled Incidents in the Public Life of Robert Standish Sievier in which he claimed that Sievier had been expelled from the Victoria Racing Club, twice been declared bankrupt, cheated a man of ¬£600 in a game of billiards and blackmailed another for ¬£5,000.Hyde (1960) p. 79 The pamphlet was released on the day of the Grand National and distributed widely through the crowds, and in response Sievier sued Wootton for libel. Sievier appeared without a lawyer, while Wootton was represented by Sir Edward Carson KC, Hastings, and E. H. Spence. After the second day of the trial, Carson was called away to Ireland on political business, and Hastings was forced to act as the primary counsel for Wootton. Hastings destroyed Sievier's reputation in cross-examination, and the jury decided in Wootton's favour.Hyde (1960) p. 86 In 1922, he became involved in Russell v Russell, which eventually went to the House of Lords, who set a common law rule that evidence about the legitimacy or illegitimacy of children born in marriage is inadmissible if it is given by either spouse.Hyde (1960) p. 94 Mr Russell, later Lord Ampthill, married Mrs Russell in 1918, with both spouses agreeing that they did not want to have children. In October 1921 Mrs Russell gave birth to a son, Geoffrey Russell, and Mr Russell immediately filed for divorce and to have the child declared a bastard.Hyde (1960) p. 88 He claimed that the child could not be his because he had not had sexual intercourse with his wife since August 1920. Hastings represented Mrs Russell in the initial trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who by a majority of three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General. Politics Hastings first became involved in politics after the First World War, when he joined the Liberal Party to help improve social conditions for the poorer people of the United Kingdom.Hyde (196) p. 118 He was being prepared to be the Liberal candidate for Ilford in the 1918 general election but grew disheartened by the Liberal alliance with the Conservative Party, and also by the divisions in the party; as a result, he gave up the candidacy.David Howell, \\"Hastings, Sir Patrick Gardiner (1880‚Äì1952)\\" in Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol. XI, Palgrave Macmillan 2003, p. 109. Hastings eventually switched sides and joined the Labour Party.Hyde (196) p. 119 His conversion, especially in the light of later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts.David Howell, \\"Hastings, Sir Patrick Gardiner (1880‚Äì1952)\\" in Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol. XI, Palgrave Macmillan 2003, p. 109-10. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, came to the conclusion that Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.John Paton, \\"Left Turn\\" (1936), p. 164, cited in David Howell, \\"Hastings, Sir Patrick Gardiner (1880‚Äì1952)\\" in Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol. XI, Palgrave Macmillan 2003, p. 110. After an interview with Sidney and Beatrice Webb he became the Labour candidate for Wallsend in December 1920. Beatrice Webb was later to write in her diaries that Hastings was \\"without any sincerely held public purpose\\" and \\"an unpleasant type of clever pleader and political arriviste, who jumped into the Labour Party just before the 1922 election, when it had become clear that the Labour Party was the alternative government and it had not a single lawyer of position attached to it\\".\\"The Diary of Beatrice Webb Volume 4 1924-1943: The Wheel of Life\\" ed. by Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie (Virago, 1985 ) pp. 19‚Äì20. Note that this diary entry on 24 March 1924, relating to events on Sunday 23 March, preceded the Campbell case. However Hastings was returned for Wallsend with a majority of 2,823 in the 1922 general election.Hyde (196) p. 120 After returning to London from Wallsend, he attended a full meeting of Labour MPs to decide who would become the Party Chairman. This effectively meant choosing the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, because Labour was the largest opposition party in the House of Commons. The two candidates were Ramsay MacDonald and J. R. Clynes, and Hastings, who supported MacDonald, persuaded six new MPs to support him. MacDonald was elected by a margin of only five votes, and Hastings later regretted his support. Hastings was indeed Labour's only experienced barrister in the House of Commons at that time, and immediately became a frontbencher and the party's main spokesman on legal matters.Hyde (196) p. 121 He made his debut speech on 22 February 1923 against the Rent Restrictions Bill, an amendment to the Rent Act 1921. He attacked it as \\"a monstrous piece of legislation\\", and was repeatedly shouted down by Conservative MPs as a \\"traitor to his class\\".Hyde (196) p. 122 As a result of this and the slow workings of Parliament, Hastings quickly became frustrated by politics. Internment orders Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State was set up as an independent British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces and members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island, the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA was forced underground.Hyde (1960) p. 123 The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self- Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March the Free State government provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil.Chandler (1924) p. 273 On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL.Hyde (1960) p. 124 Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eightyAmato (2002) p. 32 or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England),Chandler (1924) p. 274 at least six had never even been to Ireland before. The next day the arrests were publicly queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W. C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it perfectly legal. Hastings immediately stood and protested, saying that the Act was \\"one of the most dreadful things that has been done in the history of our country\\" and that the internments and deportations were effectively illegal. A few days later, the solicitors for O'Brien got in contact with Hastings.Hyde (1960) p. 126 On 23 March 1923 he appeared in R v Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O'Brien [1923] 2 KB 361 at a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing was ineffective because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien, which was required for a writ of habeas corpus to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 Act, were effectively repealed.Hyde (1960) p. 127 The court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.Hyde (1960) p. 128 Three days later, Hastings took the case to the Court of Appeal, who declared that the internment orders were invalid since the Restoration of Order Act was no longer applicable. The Government was forced to introduce a Bill to Parliament giving itself retrospective immunity for having exceeded its authority, and the whole incident was a political and legal triumph for the party and for Hastings personally.Ivan Gibbons, \\"A Parliamentary Victory: The British Labour Party and Irish Republican Deportees, 1923\\", Parliamentary History vol 29 no 2, p 192-207. Attorney-General When the new Parliament opened in 1923, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin suggested that tariff reform was the best way to solve Britain's economic difficulties. Unfortunately Bonar Law, his predecessor, had promised that there would be no tariff reforms introduced during the current Parliament. Baldwin felt that the only solution was to call a new general election.Hyde (1960) p. 130 In the ensuing election Baldwin's Conservatives lost 88 seats, with the Labour Party gaining 47 and the Liberal Party gaining 41. This produced a hung parliament, and Labour and the Liberals formed a coalition government with Labour as the main party. Hastings himself was re-elected without difficulty, increasing his majority. With Ramsay MacDonald as the new Prime Minister in the first Labour government, Hastings was appointed Attorney-General for England and Wales. This was not surprising - Labour had only two KCs in Parliament, and the other (Edward Hemmerde) was \\"unsuitable for personal reasons\\".Hyde (1960) p. 131 Hastings hesitated before accepting the appointment, despite the knighthood and appointment as head of the Bar that came with the post, and later said that \\"if I had known what the next year was to bring forward I should almost certainly have [declined]\\". Hastings described his time as Attorney General as \\"my idea of hell\\" - he was the only Law Officer available, since the Solicitor General was not a Member of Parliament, and as a result had to answer all queries about points of law in Parliament. In addition, he had his normal duties of dealing with the legal problems of government departments, and said that the day was \\"one long rush between the law courts, government departments and the House of Commons\\".Hyde (1960) p. 133 His working hours were regularly between 7am and 5am the following morning, and the policemen on duty at the House of Commons complained to him that he was working too long, since they were required to stay on duty as long as he was. Campbell Case In 1924 Hastings became involved in the Campbell Case, a prosecution which eventually led to the downfall of the Labour government. On 30 June 1924, he was met by Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who brought with him a copy of the communist newspaper Workers' Weekly. The newspaper contained an article which urged members of the military to refuse to shoot their \\"fellow workers\\" in a time of war.Hyde (1960) p. 141 Hastings approved the prosecution of the newspaper's editor, J. R. Campbell, for violating the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797. On 6 August Campbell's house was raided, and he was arrested by the police. On the same day John Scurr, a Labour backbencher, asked the Home Secretary why Campbell had been detained and on whose orders.Hyde (1960) p. 142 Hastings himself read out a reply, which said that the Director of Public Prosecutions had complained that the article was inciting troops to mutiny. Another Labour backbencher, Jimmy Maxton, rose and asked the Prime Minister \\"if he has read the article, and if he is aware that the article contains mainly a call to the troops not to allow themselves to be used in industrial disputes, and that that point of view is shared by a large number of Members sitting on these benches?\\"Hyde (1960) p. 143 This statement lead to uproar, and the Speaker was forced to intervene and halt further discussions. The next day Hastings called for both the Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution.Hyde (1960) p. 144 Maxton knew Campbell, and revealed that he was only the temporary editor and had not written the article ‚Äì the article had actually been copied from another newspaper.Hyde (1960) p. 145 Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged. The reaction of the public and the press was that the case had been thrown out because of direct pressure from the government, and that this had happened behind closed doors.Hyde (1960) p. 147 MacDonald was \\"furious\\", and the opinion of the Liberal and Conservative parties was that the government was attempting to pervert the course of justice. On 30 September Sir Kingsley Wood, a Conservative MP, asked the Prime Minister in Parliament whether he had instructed the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw the case.Hyde (1960) p. 149 MacDonald replied that \\"I was not consulted regarding either the institution or the subsequent withdrawal of these proceedings\\". A Parliamentary debate and motion to censure the Labour government on this was set for 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings into his office and suggested a way to solve the problem. Hastings would accept all the blame and resign as Attorney General, and in exchange MacDonald and the rest of the cabinet would speak for Hastings at the resulting by-election.Hyde (1960) p. 150 Hastings refused the general suggestion, but planned to make a speech at the upcoming debate explaining his actions. Time Magazine, with the quotation \\"What have I done wrong?\\" from his speech Immediately after the debate began the Prime Minister rose to speak, and said that he \\"sought to correct the impression [I] gave\\" that he knew nothing about the prosecution.Hyde (1960) p. 152 This was followed by a motion of censure pushed forward by Robert Horne, and after Horne had presented the motion Hastings rose to speak, and explained the facts of the case. His speech took over an hour, and was frequently interrupted by Conservative MPs. In his speech, Hastings took full responsibility for both the decision to prosecute and the subsequent decision to withdraw the prosecution, asking whether a censure was merited for correcting a mistake. His speech quieted the Conservatives and made it clear that a censure for the entire Parliament was going to be difficult for the Whips to enforce. The Liberal spokesman John Simon stood to speak, however, and called for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the case.Hyde (1960) p. 154 This was rejected by MacDonald, and MPs continued to speak for several more hours. The Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin privately wrote to MacDonald offering to withdraw the motion of censure in exchange for the government's support for the appointment of a Select Committee. MacDonald consulted with Jimmy Thomas and Hastings (whose reply was simply \\"Go to hell\\") and decided to reject the offer. Although the motion of censure failed, the motion to appoint a Select Committee passed the House over the opposition of the government, and the Labour government was forced out of office. Hastings was embittered by the disaster, and considered immediately quitting politics altogether, although he did not do so.Hyde (1960) pp. 156‚Äì157 His plight was depicted on the cover of Time Magazine, along with a quotation (\\"What have I done wrong?\\") from his speech. Remaining time in politics Hastings was again returned for Wallsend at the ensuing election, despite the crisis caused by the Zinoviev Letter, although with a reduced majority.Hyde (1960) p. 159 Although Hastings remained on the Labour frontbench he rarely spoke in the House of Commons, and attended less and less frequently. After suffering from kidney problems during 1925, he left Parliament by accepting the nominal position of Steward of the Manor of Northstead ‚Äî a legal fiction office with the same effect as, but less well known than, the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds) on 29 June 1926; this enabled Margaret Bondfield, who had lost her seat in the previous election, to return to Parliament in his place at the ensuing by-election. He never returned to politics.Hyde (1960) p. 609Hyde (1960) p. 161 Return to the Bar After leaving politics, Hastings returned to his work as a barrister, and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express.Hyde (1960) p. 167 The Daily Express had published two articles saying that he was a liar, and had planned out a bogus robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded barrister in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case and had his reputation destroyed as a result. Savidge Inquiry Sir Leo Chiozza Money In 1928, Hastings became involved in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.Hyde (1960) p. 176 After his release, Money immediately spoke to his official contacts, and the next morning the matter was raised in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury.Hyde (1960) p. 177 Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.Hyde (1960) p. 178 The next day, two police officers (Inspector Collins and Sergeant Clarke) and one policewoman (Lilian Wyles) called at Savidge's workplace and took her to Scotland Yard, where she was questioned. The events of that day were brought up two days later in the House of Commons, where it was alleged that Savidge had been given a \\"third degree\\" interview by Collins lasting for five hours. A public outcry followed, and the Home Secretary appointed a tribunal to investigate. The tribunal (led by Sir John Eldon Bankes, a former Lord Justice of Appeal) began sitting on 15 May 1928; Hastings, Henry Curtis-Bennett and Walter Frampton represented Savidge, and Norman Birkett represented the police. When called as a witness, Savidge testified that she had not wanted to go to Scotland Yard and had been persuaded to do so by the presence of a female police officer, Miss Wyles. After they arrived at Scotland Yard, Collins told Wyles that he was going to send Savidge home, and Wyles could leave. After Wyles had left, Collins began interviewing Savidge, threatening that she and Money would \\"suffer severely\\" if she did not tell the truth.Hyde (1960) p. 180 Savidge said that Collins' manner had become more and more familiar during the interview, and that at several points he and Sergeant Clarke had implied that they wanted her to have sexual intercourse with them.Hyde (1960) p. 181 Savidge spent almost six hours in the witness box, and her testimony left Collins looking guilty in the eyes of the tribunal. Collins, Clarke and Wyles were all interviewed, along with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Archibald Bodkin himself.Hyde (1960) p. 188 The final report of the tribunal was released on 13 June 1928 and consisted of both a majority report and a minority one, since not all of the tribunal members agreed on the validity of Savidge's evidence. The majority report said that Savidge was not intimidated into answering questions, nor treated inappropriately, and that \\"we are unable therefore to accept Miss Savidge's statement. We are satisfied that the interrogation followed the lines indicated to [Collins] by the Director of Public Prosecutions and was not unduly extended\\".Hyde (1960) p. 190 The minority report blamed the police, particularly Collins, for the method in which Savidge was interviewed. The inquiry resulted in three changes to police procedure, however: firstly, that anyone interrogated should be told beforehand about the possible consequences and purpose of the statement; secondly, that the statement should normally be taken at home; and thirdly, that in cases \\"involving matters intimately affecting [a woman's] morals\\" another woman should always be present for any interviews.Hyde (1960) p. 191 United Diamond Fields v Joel Hastings was next involved in United Diamond Fields of British Guiana Ltd v Joel and Others, which he considered both his most difficult and most interesting case.Hyde (1960) p. 197 Following the discovery of the diamond mines in South Africa, men such as Solly Joel had established a diamond syndicate to restrict the amount of diamonds on the market. For this to work, they had to control the entire output of diamonds in the world, which they planned to do by acquiring interests in all of the diamond mines. In 1925, British Guiana began producing enough diamonds to attract the attention of the syndicate, and in November 1925 a Mr Oppenheimer, representing the syndicate, entered into a contract with Mr Perez, the operator of the Guiana mines, to have worth of diamonds provided to the syndicate over a twelve-month period.Hyde (1960) p. 198 A few months later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was incorporated as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer as a technical adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate at the end of that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed.Hyde (1960) p. 199 This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down. To correct this, the syndicate were forced to reduce the flow of diamonds from British Guiana, which they did by getting Oppenheimer to reduce the price of Guianan diamonds to the point where the company output dropped from a month to less than per month. Oppenheimer then claimed that the profits were only five percent, forcing the company to reduce the price yet again. As a result of this the company was forced into liquidation in September 1927. A company board member, Victor Coen, was convinced that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings.Hyde (1960) p. 200 Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent. The trial began before Mr Justice McCardie on 4 March 1930, with Hastings for the company, and Stuart Bevan and Norman Birkett for the syndicate.Hyde (1960) p. 201 The first witness called was Coen himself, who Hastings later described as \\"the best witness without exception that I have ever seen in the witness-box\\". He was interviewed over seven days by Hastings, then Bevan and then Birkett. Eight days into the trial the matter of the certificate came up, and Oppenheimer was unable to provide an explanation. As a result, the jury found against the syndicate - they were ordered to pay back all of the company's costs, and all of its losses. Royal Mail Case In 1931, Hastings represented John Morland in the Royal Mail Case. The director of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus with the aid of the company accountant, John Morland, to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. At the same time, he had been falsifying accounting records by drawing money from the reserves and having it appear on the records as profit. Following an independent audit instigated by the Treasury, Kylsant and John Morland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and the company records and accounts. The trial began at the Old Bailey on 20 July 1931 before Mr Justice Wright, with Sir William Jowitt, D. N. Pritt and Eustace Fulton for the prosecution, Sir John Simon, J. E. Singleton and Wilfred Lewis for Lord Kylsant, and Hastings, Stuart Bevan, Frederick Tucker and C. J. Conway for John Morland.Brooks (2008) p. 1 Both defendants pleaded not guilty.Brooks (2008) p. 2 The main defence on the use of secret reserve accounting came with the help of Lord Plender. Plender was one of the most important and reliable accountants in Britain, and under cross-examination stated that it was routine for firms \\"of the very highest repute\\" to use secret reserves in calculating profit without declaring it.Hyde (1960) p. 224 Hastings said that \\"if my client ... was guilty of a criminal offence, there is not a single accountant in the City of London or in the world who is not in the same position.\\"Hyde (1960) p. 226 Both Kylsant and Morland were acquitted of falsifying records on this account, but Kylsant was found guilty of \\"making, circulating or publishing a written statement which he knew to be false\\", namely the 1928 prospectus,Brooks (2008) p.xiv and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.Brooks (2008) p.xv Elvira Barney Well known to dislike appearing in capital cases and having a heavy workload, Hastings hesitated in 1932 when approached by Sir John Mullens, a trustee of the Stock Exchange, to defend his daughter Elvira Mullens Barney on a charge of murder. Mrs Barney, who led a dissolute life of partying and drug-taking, was accused of shooting her lover in the Knightsbridge mews house they shared; she insisted that her gun had gone off by accident in a struggle. Hastings was persuaded to take the case by his wife who remembered that their children had shared a governess who had also cared for \\"dear little Elvira\\". He appeared at the Magistrates' Court, where he cross-examined the forensic scientist Sir Bernard SpilsburyAndrew Rose, 'Lethal Witness' Sutton Publishing 2007, Kent State University Press 2009 pp221-228 and at a three-day trial in the Old Bailey where Hastings was described by Peter Cotes in his book about the case as \\"the star performer\\". At the Old Bailey one of the principal crown witnesses was firearms expert Robert Churchill, who testified that the trigger of Mrs Barney's gun had a strong pull. When Hastings rose to cross-examine, he took up the gun, pointed it to the ceiling and repeatedly pulled the trigger over and over again. One crown witness had said that on another occasion she saw Elvira Barney firing the gun while holding it in her left hand; when he called his client Hastings had the gun placed in front of her. After a pause he shouted at her to pick up the gun and she spontaneously picked it up in her right hand. The Judge (Mr Justice Humphreys) described Hastings' final address as \\"certainly one of the finest speeches I have ever heard at the Bar\\" and Elvira Barney was found not guilty both of murder and manslaughter.Peter Cotes, \\"The Trial of Elvira Barney\\" (Celebrated Trials Series), David & Charles, 1976, Introduction pp. 20-35. Oswald Mosley Hastings appeared for Sir Oswald Mosley in several cases during the 1930s, having become friends with him while in Parliament.In his autobiography, Mosley wrote \\"A happy feature of these lawsuits was renewing acquaintance with the gay and brilliant Pat Hastings. In our days together in the Labour Party he equally enlivened some dull evenings with his adroit teasing of Beatrice Webb.\\" See Sir Oswald Mosley, \\"My Life\\" (Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1968), pp. 351‚Äì7. The first was a libel case against The Star, who had written a comment on one of Mosley's speeches implying that he advocated an armed revolution to overthrow the British government.Hyde (1960) p. 285 The case opened at the Royal Courts of Justice on 5 November 1934 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings representing Mosley, and Norman Birkett The Star. Birkett argued that The Star article was nothing more than a summary of Mosley's speech, and that any comments implying the overthrow of the British government were found in the speech itself.Hyde (1960) p. 287 Hastings countered that The Star was effectively accusing Mosley of high treason, and said that \\"there is really no defence to this action...I do ask for such damages as will mark [the jury's] sense of the injustice which has been done to Sir Oswald\\".Hyde (1960) p. 288 The jury eventually decided that The Star had libelled Mosley, and awarded him ¬£5,000 in damages (approximately ¬£ in 2015). Several weeks later, Hastings represented Mosley and three other members of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in a criminal case after they were indicted for \\"causing a riotous assembly\\" on 9 October 1934 at a BUF meeting. The trial opened at the Sussex Assizes on 18 December 1934 in front of Mr Justice Branson, with Hastings for the defence and John Flowers KC prosecuting.Hyde (1960) p. 289 According to Mosley, Hastings told him that Flowers, a former cricketer, had a poor reputation at the bar, and that Mosley should not show him up too much.Sir Oswald Mosley, \\"My Life\\" (Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1968), p. 355. The prosecution claimed that after a BUF meeting, Mosley and the other defendants had marched around Worthing, threatening and assaulting civilians. Hastings argued that the defendants had been deliberately provoked by a crowd of civilians, and several witnesses testified that the crowd had been throwing tomatoes and threatening Mosley. The judge eventually directed the jury to return a verdict of \\"not guilty\\". Hastings and Mosley were less successful in another libel action, against the Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen who had accused him of instructing his blackshirts to arm themselves. The defence, led by D. N. Pritt KC, called several witnesses to a fight in Manchester between blackshirts and their opponents. Hastings, taking the view that the incident was too long in the past to be relevant, did not call any rebutting evidence. Although Mosley won the case, he was awarded only a farthing in damages, traditionally a way for the jury to indicate that the case should not have been brought.Sir Oswald Mosley, \\"My Life\\" (Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1968), p. 356. Work as a playwright As well as his work as a barrister, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. His first play was The Moscow Doctor, based on a novel by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton.Hyde (1960) p. 162 He desired to have an original work performed, however, and to this end wrote The River over a period of 20 years before taking it to St James's Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage - the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg.Hyde (1960) p. 163 Reviews compared the plot to something out of the 'Boy's Own Paper. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for ¬£2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called The Notorious Lady starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford. His next play was titled Scotch Mist, and was put on at St Martin's Theatre on 26 January 1926 starring Tallulah Bankhead and Godfrey Tearle. After a reviewer named St.John Ervine wrote a review starting \\"this is the worst play I have ever seen\\", the performances bizarrely sold out for weeks later. The play was later called \\"scandalous and immoral\\" by the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, and as a result sold out for many months.Hyde (1960) p. 165 Emboldened by this success Hastings wrote The Moving Finger, which despite moderately good reviews was not popular, and was withdrawn as a result. In 1930 he wrote Slings and Arrows, which never made it to the West End because when his family, who were familiar with the play, attended the shows, they read out the lines of the characters in bored and dreary voices just before the actors themselves spoke. As a result, the play was reduced to chaos.Hyde (1960) p. 166 Subsequent West End plays were Escort (1942) and The Blind Goddess (1947), the latter adapted into a film of the same title by Gainsborough Pictures the following year. Retirement and death Hastings retired from most of his work as a barrister in 1938, but soon found a way to occupy himself after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.Hyde (1960) p. 356 Although, at fifty-nine, far past the age at which he could join the armed forces, Hastings wrote to the Secretary of State for War offering his services, and was eventually contacted by Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, who offered him a commission in the Royal Air Force as a squadron leader in Administrative and Special Duties Branch, serving with Fighter Command. His commission was dated 25 September 1939. He then started work at RAF Stanmore Park, but found his work \\"very depressing\\" - most of the other officers were over thirty years younger than he was, and he suffered from continuous bad health while there.Hyde (1960) p. 359 His one major contribution was to create a scheme allowing the purchase of small models of German aircraft, allowing the British forces on the ground an easy way to identify incoming planes and avoiding friendly fire situations. Due to his ill-health he relinquished his commission on 7 December 1939. In Spring 1940 he was elected Treasurer of the Middle Temple. He participated in only a few cases following his war service.Hyde (1960) p. 395 One was a high-profile case in November and December 1946 in which he was engaged by the Newark Advertiser in defence of a libel action brought by Harold Laski, who was seeking to clear his name from the newspaper's claim that he had called for socialism \\"even if it means violence\\". Cross-examining Laski, the following exchange occurred: > HASTINGS: Are there any privileged in the Socialist Party? > LASKI: Why, indeed, Sir Patrick, when you were a member‚Äî > THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: No, Mr. Laski. > HASTINGS: Do not be rude. Laski's counsel later said that he hoped that Hastings would at least have said \\"Touch√©\\".\\"The Laski Libel Action\\" (Published by the Daily Express, 1948), pp. 94 and 362. Laski lost the case, unable to counter the questioning from Hastings which referred to his previous written works.Michael Newman, ‚ÄòLaski, Harold Joseph (1893‚Äì1950)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 12 September 2009.

Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 12 September 2009. In 1948, Hastings published his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, and the following year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published Famous and Infamous Cases, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg.Hyde (1960) p. 400 In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, he and his wife travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved to start a new life after the end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, and he never fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years of his life living in a flat in London, before dying on 26 February 1952 of cerebral thrombosis.Hyde (1960) p. 402 Personal life Hastings married Mary Grundy on 1 June 1906. The couple had two sons, David and Nicholas, and three daughters. David died in the Second World War fighting in the Pacific Theatre, and Nicholas became a farmer in Kenya.Hyde (1960) p. 393 One daughter, Barbara, married Nicolas Bentley, a cartoonist.

It has been nicknamed, \\"The Old Lighthouse.\\" It is the oldest such shelter in Chicago. According to the PGM website, \\"Pacific Garden Mission is the oldest, continuously operating rescue mission in the country.\\" Among the converts to Christ from PGM's efforts are the famous evangelists, Billy Sunday and Mel Trotter. In 1950, the Mission began production of Unshackled!, a radio dramatic series showcasing conversions to Evangelical Christianity. The show, recorded live at PGM, remains in production today and is translated into seven languages for international distribution. Mission interior, 1914 PGM's original location was at 386 S. Clark Street. In 1880, the mission moved to 67 E. Van Buren Street, in a location formerly known as the \\"Pacific Beer Garden.\\" The current name, \\"Pacific Garden Mission,\\" was adopted at that time - it was suggested by evangelist D.L. Moody that the name of the former occupant be kept but with the word \\"Beer\\" dropped from the name. The Mission moved to 646 S. State Street, in 1923, following a shift in the location of Chicago's Skid Row, just south of The Loop. At that time, the area was known for its hobo jungles and flophouses. Due to large population growth in the neighborhood beginning in the 1990s and continuing through the 2000s, Jones College Prep, a public high school located at 606 S. State Street, wanted to expand its undersized and outdated facilities. The Mission signed an agreement with the city in December 2004 to move to a new location at 14th Place and Canal Street, about one mile southwest of its State Street location. PGM's State Street building was slated for demolition to make room for the Jones expansion. Groundbreaking for the new facility took place on November 16, 2005, at 1458 S. Canal Street. The building, designed by Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman of Tigerman McCurry Architects, was completed in 2007, with the formal dedication October 13, 2007.

Its geographic range once used to cover only the Parana River region of South America, but it has since expanded to cover over 30 countries, such as the United States, New Zealand, China and many more. This invasive species is believed to have been accidentally introduced to these non-native regions through sediments trapped/attached to tanks and cargo of ships travelling from South America to these various areas.  Description  Alternanthera philoxeroides can thrive in both dry and aquatic environments and is characterized by whitish, papery flowers along its short stalks, irregular, or sprawling hollow stems, and simple and opposite leaf pattern sprouting from its nodes. The species is dioecious. It is also considered a herbaceous plant due to its short-lived shoot system. It produces horizontal stems, otherwise known as stolons, that can sprout up to in length and thanks to its hollow stems, floats easily. This results in large clusters of stem amassing and create dense mats along the surface. The plant flowers from December to April and usually grows around in diameter and tend to be papery and ball-shaped. The weed's intricate root system can either allow them to hang free in the water to absorb nutrients or directly penetrate the soil/sediment and pull their nutrients from below.  Negative impacts  Alternanthera philoxeroides is considered a major threat to ecosystems because of the adverse effects it poses on both aquatic and terrestrial environments, as well as the negative influence it has on society.  Impacts on vegetation  The presence of this invasive species disrupts the natural flow of water due to the dense mats created by its clusters of stems. It out competes the native vegetation for space and solar energy through these dense mats because they form large clusters and limit the amount of light that submerged vegetation receives. These compact clusters of stems also disturb the regular exchange of gases that occurs underneath the surface that directly influences aerobic processes, such as photosynthesis. Aside from driving down the population of native aquatic vegetation, A. philoxeroides can also influence the growth and yield of crops in pastures and fields.https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/67831/IPA- Alligator-Weed-Risk-Assessment.pdf These dense mats can affect the natural flow of water that is used in irrigation systems and as well as affect the quality of the water by increasing the sedimentation present in the water. Both of these factors must remain undisturbed for crops to grow well, and thus to provide a healthy yield for farmers, which will be discussed in the later section on its impacts on society. On top of this, the likelihood of flooding is higher due to the impaired drainage caused by the dense mats, which in turn can also damage crops. This invasive species also has other negative impacts on the environment.  Impacts on animals  As mentioned, the compact mats formed by this species can drive down the population of native vegetation in the environments it invades. This then becomes a major issue for native herbivores because their food source declines. In addition, the dense mats present a challenge for the native wildlife by acting as a barrier between them and natural water sources. However, even if they can reach the water, they are still at risk because the water quality can be contaminated by the increased sediments. Thus, just as it did with the native vegetation, A. philoxeroides is also driving down the populations of the native wildlife as well.  Impacts on society  Dense mats formed by this species influence the natural flow of water, which can impede various recreational activities, such as boating and fishing. The disruption of flow can also have a negative impact on infrastructure when it comes to energy, such as the use of hydro- electric dams to power generators. The dense mats also present suitable ecological conditions that mosquitoes can thrive off of. This is a commensal relationship between mosquitoes and A. philoxeroides because mosquitoes receive a breeding ground and the plant gains nothing nor loses anything. The increased population of mosquitoes can bring an increased risk of mosquito- borne diseases in humans. Furthermore, the dense mats produced by A. philoxeroides may not present suitable ecological conditions for native species or humans to thrive off.  Reproduction and dispersal  This invasive plant depends solely on vegetative means to reproduce and disperse itself in the area it has invaded and established its roots. In its native geographic range, the species spreads to through means of producing viable seeds; however, it has been observed within its non-native ranges that it rarely produces viable seeds. To accommodate this, the A. philoxeroides reproduces through fragmentation; the plant can regenerate itself from small portions of stems or small leaf cuttings. These small fragments of the plant can then be dispersed through human means and natural means; once it is dispersed, the fragments can then find suitable ecological conditions and root themselves and regenerate.  Human dispersal  In effort to eradicate the species by manual means, such as mulching or pulling them out, if not removed efficiently, small stem fragments can be displaced to new areas. Soil movement caused by earthmoving machinery is another example of how humans influence the dispersal of the plant.  Natural dispersal  In aquatic environments, the A. philoxeroides can easily disperse its fragments by being sucked into the path of the waterways. In terrestrial environments, the small fragments of stems and leaf cuttings can be dispersed through the natural movement of soil caused by erosion. Thus, the geographic range of this invasive species can easily be expanded by any means necessary due to its ability to regenerate from practically nothing.  Methods of control   Preventive measures  Early detection is the best bet to ensure that the invasive species does not successfully colonize a non-native region because of its ability to regenerate and propagate from small portions of its stem or leaf cuttings. However, when that is not possible, the best that can be done is to limit and control the presence of A. philoxeroides in an area. Alternanthera philoxeroides can only establish itself in shallow waters no deeper than , so one method of control is to erect barriers in shallower areas to limit the amount of suitable space the plant has. When it comes to terrestrial environments, overpopulating the area with native species can limit the suitable space available for it. However, this method is only effective before the invasive plant has asserted itself in an area. Lastly, as previously mentioned, this plant is only able to produce viable seeds in its native geographic range and not in the areas it has invaded. Learning why that is - what ecological conditions make it produce only sterile seeds - could be key to developing further preventative measures against it.  Biological measures  Insects have been released for the biological control of A. philoxeroides. The most successful and widely used is Agasicles hygrophila commonly called the alligator weed flea beetle; it has been released for biocontrol in Australia, China, Thailand, New Zealand, and the United States. However, their effectiveness is limited due to their inability to survive through temperatures lower than . Amynothrips andersoni, the alligator weed thrips, and Vogtia malloi, the alligator weed stem borer, have also been released in the United States. These species result in immediate wilting and limit A. philoxeroides reproduction by colonizing its stems. A variety of chemicals have been shown to be effective in controlling the plant, the most useful of which include glyphosate, triclopyr, fluridone, imazamox, and imazapyr; however, they must constantly be applied to be successful.

Originally a Benedictine community founded from Reading Abbey in England and based on the Isle of May, it was relocated to Pittenweem by 1318, and placed under the control of the Augustinian canons regular of St Andrews Priory. The fortified east gatehouse in 2015 History In the Middle Ages, Pittenweem Priory was a small Augustinian monastery linked to that on the Isle of May and built over the ancient sacred cave associated with Saint Fillan. The cave, recently fitted out as a chapel, is situated in Cove Wynd (leading from the High Street down to the harbour) and is open to the public with the key available locally from the Cocoa Tree Cafe. From this rough dwelling Fillan is said to have converted the local Pictish population. The cave was re-discovered around 1900 when a horse ploughing in the priory garden fell down a hole into it. The cave has flat rocks that are presumed to be 'beds' and a small spring of \\"holy water\\" at the rear. St Fillan's Cave was also used as prison for witches during the witch hunts of the 17th-18th centuries (see below). A shrine was dedicated to Saint Adrian of May on that island. It is said that Adrian's monks undertook the first harbour improvements, laying the foundation for the fishing industry, but no evidence for this currently exists. The present Church of Scotland parish kirk is on the site of the priory church. Much of the fortified east gatehouse of the priory survives (15th century), as does the 'Great House', one of Scotland's best-preserved late medieval houses, which may have served as living quarters for the prior and monks. It was designated a Category A listed building in 1972.

It was one of the last stages of Battle of Hakodate during the Boshin War, and occurred near Hakodate in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaid≈ç. Ezo Republic forces The naval forces of the Ezo Republic were grouped around the warship Kaiten. The fleet originally consisted of eight steamships: Kaiten, Banry≈´, Japanese gunboat Chiyoda,Jentschura p. 113 Ch≈çgei, Kaiy≈ç Maru, Kanrin Maru, Mikaho and Shinsoku. However, Kaiy≈ç Maru and Shinsoku had been lost in a previous engagement in front of Esashi, and Kanrin Maru had been captured by Imperial forces after suffering damage in bad weather. The loss of these two major units seriously weakened the Ezo Republic side. Imperial forces For the operation, an Imperial Japanese Navy fleet had been rapidly constituted around the recently acquired ironclad warship K≈çtetsu (the former CSS Stonewall), which had been purchased from the United States. Other Imperial ships were Kasuga, Hiry≈´, Teib≈ç, , M≈çshun, which had been supplied by the domains of Saga, Ch≈çsh≈´ and Satsuma to the newly formed Meiji government in 1868. The nascent Imperial government started with a much weaker navy than that of the Ezo Republic, both in terms of vessel strength, unity (most of its ships were borrowed from Western domains), and training. However the loss of two major units on the Ezo side previous to the main action (Kaiy≈ç Maru and Kanrin Maru), and most of all, the incorporation of the revolutionary K≈çtetsu since April 1868 on the Imperial side (a ship originally ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate but withheld by the United States during the main conflict under a policy of neutrality taken by foreign nation and finally delivered to the newly formed government), turned the tables. In addition, the Imperial government received the support of two transportation ships chartered by the United States for the transportation of its troops. Combat Sinking of Chiyodagata by the rebel Banry≈´ The Imperial fleet supported the deployment of troops on the island of Hokkaid≈ç, destroyed onshore fortifications and attacked the rebel ships. On 4 May Chiyodagata was captured by Imperial forces after having been abandoned in a grounding and on 7 May Kaiten was heavily hit and put out of action. Banry≈´ managed to sink the Imperial forces' Chiyodagata, but Banry≈´ later sank in turn because of heavy damage. The Imperial Japanese Navy won the engagement, ultimately leading to the surrender of the Republic of Ezo at the end of May 1869. A Japanese rendition of the land and naval battle of Hakodate Ships of foreign navies -- the British HMS Pearl and the French Coetlogon -- were standing by neutrally during the conflict. The French captain Jules Brunet who had trained the rebels and helped organize their defenses, surrendered on Coetlogon on 8 June. The future Admiral of the fleet T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç participated in the battle on the Imperial side as a young third-class officer, onboard Kasuga. References Bibliography *Ballard C.

Nonribosomal peptides are also found in higher organisms, such as nudibranchs, but are thought to be made by bacteria inside these organisms. While there exist a wide range of peptides that are not synthesized by ribosomes, the term nonribosomal peptide typically refers to a very specific set of these as discussed in this article. Nonribosomal peptides are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, which, unlike the ribosomes, are independent of messenger RNA. Each nonribosomal peptide synthetase can synthesize only one type of peptide. Nonribosomal peptides often have cyclic and/or branched structures, can contain non-proteinogenic amino acids including D-amino acids, carry modifications like N-methyl and N-formyl groups, or are glycosylated, acylated, halogenated, or hydroxylated. Cyclization of amino acids against the peptide \\"backbone\\" is often performed, resulting in oxazolines and thiazolines; these can be further oxidized or reduced. On occasion, dehydration is performed on serines, resulting in dehydroalanine. This is just a sampling of the various manipulations and variations that nonribosomal peptides can perform. Nonribosomal peptides are often dimers or trimers of identical sequences chained together or cyclized, or even branched. Nonribosomal peptides are a very diverse family of natural products with an extremely broad range of biological activities and pharmacological properties. They are often toxins, siderophores, or pigments. Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics, cytostatics, and immunosuppressants are in commercial use. Examples * Antibiotics ** Actinomycin ** Bacitracin ** Calcium dependent antibiotic ** Daptomycin ** Vancomycin ** Teixobactin ** Tyrocidine ** Gramicidin ** Zwittermicin A * Antibiotic precursors ** ACV-Tripeptide * Cytostatics ** Epothilone ** Bleomycin * Immunosuppressants ** Ciclosporin (Cyclosporine A) * Siderophores ** Pyoverdine ** Enterobactin ** Myxochelin A * Pigments ** Indigoidine * Toxins ** Microcystins and ** Nodularins, cyanotoxins from cyanobacteria. * Nitrogen storage polymers ** Cyanophycin ‚Äì produced by some cyanobacteria * Phytotoxins ** HC-toxin ‚Äì a virulence factor made by the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus (Helminthosporium) carbonum ** AM-toxin ‚Äì made by the plant pathogenic fungus Alternaria alternata pv. Mali ** victorin ‚Äì a chlorinated cyclic pentapeptide made by the pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus victoriae. Its nonribosomal synthesis has not been established.  Biosynthesis  Nonribosomal peptides are synthesized by one or more specialized nonribosomal peptide-synthetase (NRPS) enzymes. The NRPS genes for a certain peptide are usually organized in one operon in bacteria and in gene clusters in eukaryotes. However the first fungal NRP to be found was ciclosporin. It is synthesized by a single 1.6MDa NRPS. The enzymes are organized in modules that are responsible for the introduction of one additional amino acid. Each module consists of several domains with defined functions, separated by short spacer regions of about 15 amino acids. The biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides shares characteristics with the polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. Due to these structural and mechanistic similarities, some nonribosomal peptide synthetases contain polyketide synthase modules for the insertion of acetate or propionate-derived subunits into the peptide chain. Note that as many as 10% percent of bacterial NRPS are not laid out as large modular proteins, but as separate enzymes. Some NRPS modules deviate from the standard domain structure, and some extra domains have been described. There are also NRPS enzymes that serve as a scaffold for other modifications to the substrate to incorporate unusual amino acids.  Modules  The order of modules and domains of a complete nonribosomal peptide synthetase is as follows: * Initiation or Starting module: [F/NMT]-A-PCP- * Elongation or Extending modules: -(C/Cy)-[NMT]-A-PCP-[E]- * Termination or Releasing module: -(TE/R) (Order: N-terminus to C-terminus; []: optionally; (): alternatively)  Domains  * F: Formylation (optional) * A: Adenylation (required in a module) * PCP: Thiolation and peptide carrier protein with attached 4'-phospho-pantetheine (required in a module) * C: Condensation forming the amide bond (required in a module) * Cy: Cyclization into thiazoline or oxazolines (optional) * Ox: Oxidation of thiazolines or oxazolines to thiazoles or oxazoles (optional) * Red: Reduction of thiazolines or oxazolines to thiazolidines or oxazolidines (optional) * E: Epimerization into D-amino acids (optional) * NMT: N-methylation (optional) * TE: Termination by a thio-esterase (only found once in a NRPS) * R: Reduction to terminal aldehyde or alcohol (optional) * X: Recruits cytochrome P450 enzymes (optional)  Starting stage  * Loading: The first amino acid is activated with ATP as a mixed acyl-phosphoric acid anhydride with AMP by the A-domain and loaded onto the serine-attached 4'-phospho-pantethine (4'PP) sidechain of the PCP-domain catalyzed by the PCP- domain (thiolation). * Some A domains require interaction with MbtH-like proteins for their activity. * Sometimes the amino group of the bound amino acid is formylated by an F-domain or methylated by an NMT-domain. Elongation stages * Loading: Analogous to the starting stage, each module loads its specific amino acid onto its PCP-domain. * Condensation: The C-domain catalyzes the amide bond formation between the thioester group of the growing peptide chain from the previous module with the amino group of the current module. The extended peptide is now attached to the current PCP- domain. * Condensation-Cyclization: Sometimes the C-domain is replaced by a Cy-domain, which, in addition to the amide bond formation, catalyzes the reaction of the serine, threonine, or cysteine sidechain with the amide-N, thereby forming oxazolidines and thiazolidine, respectively. * Epimerization: Sometimes an E-domain epimerizes the innermost amino acid of the peptide chain into the D-configuration. * This cycle is repeated for each elongation module.  Termination stage  * Termination: The TE-domain (thio-esterase domain) hydrolyzes the completed polypeptide chain from the PCP-domain of the previous module, thereby often forming cyclic amides (lactams) or cyclic esters (lactones). * Also, the peptide can be released by an R-domain that reduces the thioester bond to terminal aldehyde or alcohol.  Processing The final peptide is often modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acylation, halogenation, or hydroxylation. The responsible enzymes are usually associated to the synthetase complex and their genes are organized in the same operons or gene clusters. Priming and deblocking To become functional, the 4'-phospho-pantetheine sidechain of acyl-CoA molecules has to be attached to the PCP-domain by 4'PP transferases (Priming) and the S-attached acyl group has to be removed by specialized associated thioesterases (TE-II) (Deblocking).  Substrate specificities  Most domains have a very broad substrate specificity and usually only the A-domain determines which amino acid is incorporated in a module. Ten amino acids that control substrate specificity and can be considered the 'codons' of nonribosomal peptide synthesis have been identified, and rational protein design has yielded methodologies to computationally switch the specificities of A-domains. The condensation C-domain is also believed to have substrate specificity, especially if located behind an epimerase E-domain-containing module where it functions as a 'filter' for the epimerized isomer. Computational methods, such as SANDPUMA and NRPSpredictor2, have been developed to predict substrate specificity from DNA or protein sequence data.  Mixed with polyketides  Due to the similarity with polyketide synthases (PKS), many secondary metabolites are, in fact, fusions of NRPs and polyketides. In essence, this occurs when PK modules follow NRP modules, and vice versa. Although there is high degree of similarity between the Carrier (PCP/ACP) domains of both types of synthetases, the mechanism of condensation is different from a chemical standpoint: * PKS, carbon-carbon bond formation through Claisen condensation reaction * NRPs, the C domain catalyzes the amide bond formation between the amino acid it adds to the chain (on the PCP of one module) and the nascent peptide(on the PCP of the next module).

It allows the user to see traffic load on a network over time in graphical form. It was originally developed by Tobias Oetiker and Dave Rand to monitor router traffic, but has developed into a tool that can create graphs and statistics for almost anything. MRTG is written in Perl and can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS and NetWare. A sample MRTG bandwidth graph. How it works SNMP MRTG uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to send requests with two object identifiers (OIDs) to a device. The device, which must be SNMP-enabled, will have a management information base (MIB) to look up the OIDs specified. After collecting the information it will send back the raw data encapsulated in an SNMP protocol. MRTG records this data in a log on the client along with previously recorded data for the device. The software then creates an HTML document from the logs, containing a list of graphs detailing traffic for the selected devices in the server. Script output Alternatively, MRTG can be configured to run a script or command, and parse its output for counter values. The MRTG website contains a large library of external scripts to enable monitoring of SQL database statistics, firewall rules, CPU fan RPMs, or virtually any integer-value data. Features * Measures two values (I for Input, O for Output) per target. * Gets its data via an SNMP agent, or through the output of a command line. * Typically collects data every five minutes (it can be configured to collect data less frequently). * Creates an HTML page per target that features four graphs (GIF or PNG images). * Results are plotted vs time into day, week, month and year graphs, with the I plotted as a full green area, and the O as a blue line. * Automatically scales the Y axis of the graphs to show the most detail. * Adds calculated Max, Average and Current values for both I and O to the target's HTML page. * Can also send warning emails if targets have values above a certain threshold.

Modern firearms are susceptible also. The delay is usually too brief to be noticed, but can be several seconds. A hangfire should be suspected whenever a firearm fails to fire, but has not clearly malfunctioned. Ignition sequence The ignition train of modern firearms begins with detonation of a small quantity of impact-sensitive primary explosive in a primer in cartridge firearms or in a percussion cap in muzzleloaders. The energy released by this detonation is intended to ignite the propellant charge of gunpowder or smokeless powder. Primary explosives may deteriorate with age so they release less energy; and propellants damaged by moisture or lubricants may require more energy to ignite. These conditions may either delay the ignition sequence or cause a misfire if ignition is completely prevented. While a normal ignition sequence causes the firearm to discharge immediately when the trigger is pulled, a hang fire will be perceived as a click when the hammer falls followed by the loud noise of suddenly expanding gas when the firearm discharges. The delay may be only a fraction of second or may last for several seconds. Procedures A shooter may interpret the initial click of the hammer fall as an unloaded firearm or a misfire. A hang fire delay of a fraction of a second may be fast enough to correct that misinterpretation before the shooter takes inappropriate action to reload; but a longer delay may allow the shooter time to move the firearm so the muzzle points in a different (and possibly unsafe) direction, or to open the action so the cartridge is no longer confined. Unexpected discharge after the firearm has been moved from the firing position will damage whatever is in front of the muzzle, and large-caliber firearms may injure the shooter during recoil. Unexpected discharge as the action is being opened will allow a portion of the propellant energy to burst the cartridge case and possibly damage the firearm with a risk of injury to the shooter and nearby persons. The correct procedure is to keep the firearm pointed at a safe target for thirty seconds, then remove the round. This rule is usually not followed in combat, where being without a working firearm is the bigger risk.

During his time in the House, he served Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district from 1863 to 1875 and Pennsylvania's 3rd congressional district from 1875 to 1890. He was a contender for his party's nomination for President of the United States in 1880 and 1884. Born in Philadelphia to a family active in Whig politics, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council and then to the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 1st district. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was re-elected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power. Randall's support for smaller, less centralized government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats lost control of the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for president in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890. Early life and family Randall was born on October 10, 1828, in Philadelphia, the eldest son of Josiah and Ann Worrell Randall. Three younger brothers soon followed: William, Robert, and Henry. Josiah Randall was a leading Philadelphia lawyer who had served in the state legislature in the 1820s. Randall's paternal grandfather, Matthew Randall, was a judge on the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas and county prothonotary in that city in the early 19th century. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Worrell, was also a prominent citizen, active in politics for the Democratic Party during Thomas Jefferson's presidency. Josiah Randall was a Whig in politics, but drifted into the Democratic fold after the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s. When Randall was born, the family lived at Seventh and Walnut Streets in what is now Center City Philadelphia. Randall was educated at the University Academy, a school affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania. On completing school at age 17, he did not follow his father into the law, but instead took a job as a bookkeeper with a local silk merchant. Shortly thereafter, he started a coal delivery business and, at age 21, became a partner in a scrap iron business named Earp and Randall. Two years later, in 1851, Randall married Fannie Agnes Ward, the daughter of Aaron and Mary Watson Ward of Sing Sing, New York. Randall's new father-in-law was a major general in the New York militia and had served in Congress as a Jacksonian Democrat for several terms between 1825 and 1843. Randall and Fannie went on to have three children: Ann, Susan, and Samuel Josiah. Local politics and military service In 1851, Randall assisted his father in the election campaign for a local judge. The judge, a Whig, was elected despite considerable opposition from a candidate of the nativist American Party (commonly called the \\"Know- Nothing Party\\"). The strength of this group, combined with the Whigs' declining fortunes, led Samuel Randall to call himself an \\"American Whig\\" when he ran for Philadelphia Common Council the following year. He was elected, holding office for four one-year terms from 1852 to 1856. The period was one of significant change in Philadelphia's governance, as all of Philadelphia County's townships and boroughs were consolidated into one city in 1854. Randall served in the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry (headquarters shown) in 1861 and 1863. As the Whig Party fell apart, Randall and his family became Democrats. Josiah Randall was friendly with James Buchanan, a Pennsylvania Democrat then serving as the United States' envoy in Great Britain. Both Randall and his father attended the Democratic National Convention in 1856 to work for Buchanan's nomination for president, which was successful. When, in 1858, a vacancy occurred in Randall's state Senate district, he ran for election (as a Democrat) for the remainder of the term, and was elected. Still only 30 years old, Randall had risen rapidly in politics. Much of his term in the state Senate was spent dealing with the incorporation of street railway companies, which he believed would benefit his district. Randall also supported legislation to reduce the power of banks, a policy that he would continue to advocate for his entire political career. In 1860, he ran for election to a full term in the state Senate while his brother Robert ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives. Ignoring their father's advice that it meant \\"too much Randall on the ticket\\", both brothers were unsuccessful. In 1861, the Civil War began as eleven Southern states seceded from the Union to form the Confederate States of America. Randall joined the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry in May of that year as a private. The unit was stationed in central Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia during Randall's 90-day enlistment, but saw no action during that time. In 1863, he re-joined the unit, this time being elected captain. The First Troop was sent back to central Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg campaign that summer, when Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania. He served as provost marshal at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in the days before the battle there, and had the same role at Columbia, Pennsylvania during the battle, but did not see combat. As historian Albert V. House explained, \\"[h]is military career was respectable, but far from arduous, most of his duties being routine reconnoitering which seldom led him under fire.\\" House of Representatives Election to the House Pennsylvania's first congressional district in 1862 (outlined in red) In 1862, before rejoining his cavalry unit, Randall was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district. The city had been gerrymandered by a Republican legislature to create four solidly Republican districts, with the result that as many Democrats as possible were lumped into the 1st district. Gaining the Democratic nomination was, thus, tantamount to election; Randall defeated former mayor Richard Vaux for their party's endorsement and won easily over his Republican opponent, Edward G. Webb. He won with the help of William \\"Squire\\" McMullen, the Democratic boss of the fourth ward, who would remain a lifelong Randall ally. Under the congressional calendar of the 1860s, members of the 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863. Randall arrived that month, after being discharged from his cavalry unit, to join a Congress dominated by Republicans. As a member of the minority, Randall had little opportunity to author legislation, but quickly became known as a hard-working and conscientious member. James G. Blaine, a Republican also first elected in 1862, later characterized Randall as \\"a strong partisan, with many elements of leadership. He... never neglects his public duties, and never forgets the interests of the Democratic Party.\\" Randall was known as a friend to the manufacturers in his district, especially as it concerned protective tariffs. Despite being in the minority, Randall spoke often in defense of his constituents' interests. As House described him, With his party continually in the minority, Randall gained experience in the functioning of the House, but his tenure left little evidence in the statute book. He attracted little attention, but kept his constituents happy and was repeatedly reelected. War and Reconstruction Randall shortly after his election to Congress When the 38th Congress convened in December 1863, the Civil War was approaching its end. Randall was a War Democrat, sometimes siding with his Republican colleagues to support measures in pursuit of victory over the Confederates. When a bill was proposed to allow President Abraham Lincoln to promote Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general, Randall voted in favor, unlike most in his party. He voted with the majority of Democrats, however, to oppose allowing black men to serve in the Union Army. When it came to political plans for the post-war nation, he was strictly opposed to most Republican-proposed measures. Republicans proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, which would abolish slavery, and Randall spoke against it. Claiming opposition to slavery, Randall said his objections stemmed instead from a belief that the amendment was \\"a beginning of changes in the Constitution and the forerunner of usurpation\\". After Andrew Johnson became president following Lincoln's assassination, Randall came to support Johnson's policies for Reconstruction of the defeated South, which were more lenient than those of the Republican majority in Congress. In 1867, the Republicans proposed requiring an ironclad oath from all Southerners wishing to vote, hold office, or practice law in federal courts, making them swear they had never borne arms against the United States. Randall led a 16-hour filibuster against the measure; in spite of his efforts, it passed. Randall began to gain prominence in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks‚Äîlong enough to prevent it from being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt. As impeachment proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall became one of his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches in favor of the president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office. Financial legislation Philadelphia industrial workers benefited from Randall's support for high tariffs. With Grant, a Republican, elected president in 1868, and the 41st Congress as Republican-dominated as its immediate predecessors, Randall faced several more years in the minority. He served on the Banking and Currency Committee and began to focus on financial matters, resuming his long-standing policy against the power of banks. This placed Randall in the growing fight over the nature of the nation's currency‚Äîthose who favored the gold-backed currency were called \\"hard money\\" supporters, while the policy of encouraging inflation through coining silver or issuing dollars backed by government bonds (\\"greenbacks\\") was known as \\"soft money\\". Although he believed in a gold-backed dollar, Randall was friendly to greenbacks; in general, he favored allowing the amount of currency to remain constant, while replacing bank-issued dollar bills with greenbacks. He also believed the federal government should sell its bonds directly to the public, rather than selling them only to large banks, which then re-sold them at a profit. He was unsuccessful in convincing the Republican majority to adopt any of these measures. Randall worked with Republicans to shift the source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He believed the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive. Tariff legislation generally found favor with Randall, which put him more often in alliance with Republicans than Democrats. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, Randall worked to raise tariffs on a wide variety of imported goods. Even so, he sometimes differed with the Republicans when he believed the tariff proposed was too high; biographer Alfred V. House describes Randall's attitude as supporting \\"higher tariff rates... largely because he believed that the benefits of such high rates were passed on to the labor population.\\" In 1870, he opposed the pig iron tariff as too high, against the wishes of fellow Pennsylvanian William \\"Pig Iron\\" Kelley. Randall called his version of protectionism \\"incidental protection\\": he believed tariffs should be high enough to support the cost of running the government, but applied only to those industries that needed tariff protection to survive foreign competition. Appropriations and investigations While the Democrats were in the minority, Randall spent much of his time scrutinizing the Republicans' appropriations bills. During the Grant administration, he questioned thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments' needs. He proposed a bill that would end the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through at the end of a session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations. Investigating appropriations led Randall to focus on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Cr√©dit Mobilier of America. Cr√©dit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares that they had been allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal). Randall was caught on the wrong side of one scandal in 1873 when Congress passed a retroactive pay increase. On the last day of the term, the 42nd Congress voted to raise its members' pay by 50%, including a raise made retroactive to the beginning of the term. Randall voted for the pay raise, and against the amendment that would have removed the retroactive provision. The law, later known as the Salary Grab Act, provoked outrage across the country. Randall defended the Act, saying that an increased salary would \\"put members of Congress beyond temptation\\" and reduce fraud. Seeing the unpopularity of the Salary Grab, the incoming 43rd Congress repealed it almost immediately, with Randall voting for repeal. Rise to prominence Michael C. Kerr defeated Randall in the election for Speaker in 1875, but died in 1876. Democrats remained in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase the power of the federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther- reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment. Randall stood against this measure, as he had against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of consensus delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority for the first time since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues. As Democrats took control of the House in 1875, Randall was considered among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party. In the meantime, the divisions in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused to take his place as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again. Speaker of the House Hayes and Tilden Electoral Commission decided the disputed 1876 presidential election. After Kerr's death, Randall was the consensus choice of the Democratic caucus, and was elected to the Speakership when Congress returned to Washington on December 2, 1876. He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. The Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden of New York, had 184 electoral votes, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt. Randall spent early December in conference with Tilden while committees examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, with each of the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes. Randall supported the idea, believing it the best solution to an intractable problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8‚Äì7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker usually does not vote). The commission met and awarded all the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8‚Äì7 party-line vote. Democrats were outraged, and many demanded that they filibuster the final count in the House. Randall did not commit, but permitted the House to take recesses several times, delaying the decision. As the March4 inauguration day approached, leaders of both parties met at Wormley's Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise. Republicans promised that, in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the commission's decision, Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining \\"unredeemed\\" states there. The Democratic leadership, including Randall, agreed and the filibuster ended. Monetary disputes silver dollars, such as this Morgan dollar, in 1878. Randall returned to Washington in March 1877 at the start of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return the United States to the gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill. The attempt at repeal did not end the controversy over silver. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. Randall allowed the bill to come to the floor for an up-or-down vote during a special session in November 1877: the result was its passage by a vote of 163 to 34 (with 94 members absent). The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa, led the effort in the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the seignorage, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. President Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode the veto, and the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act became law. Potter committee As the 1880 presidential elections approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed of the presidency in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought an investigation into the 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states. Randall left no doubt about his sympathies when he assigned members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had the opposite of the Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess. Reelected Speaker As the 46th Congress convened in 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, but they still held a plurality of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, most of whom were affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more. Civil rights and the army Cartoon depicting \\"SJR\\", published in Harper's Weekly (September 25, 1880) Randall's determination to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power in their home states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880. 1880 presidential election As the 1880 elections approached, Randall had two goals: to increase his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, as well as to wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead. When the state convention gathered in April 1880, Randall was confident of victory, but soon found that the Wallace faction outnumbered his. Wallace's majority scrambled the party's organization in Philadelphia and, although some Randall supporters received seats, the majority owed allegiance to the senator. Despite the defeat, Randall pressed on for Tilden, both in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. As rumors circulated that Tilden's health would keep him from running again, Randall remained a loyal Tilden man up to the national convention that June. After the first ballot, the New York delegation released a letter from Tilden in which he withdrew from consideration. Randall hoped for the ex-Tilden delegates to rally to him. Many did so, and Randall surged to second place on the second ballot, but the momentum had shifted to another candidate, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Nearly all the delegates shifted to Hancock, and he was nominated. Randall believed he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless in support of his party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes‚Äîincluding those of Pennsylvania. Worse still for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end. Later House service John G. Carlisle bested Randall for Speaker in 1883. Tariffs When Randall returned to Washington in 1881 to begin his term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had returned to his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support it. The bill that emerged from the Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March 3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less. The Democrats recaptured the House after the 1882 elections, but the incoming majority in the 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker more in line with their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to canvass the incoming representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53. Carlisle selected William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to lead the Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall to take charge of Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151. Presidential election of 1884 As in 1880, the contest for the Democratic nomination for president in 1884 began under the shadow of Tilden. Declining health forced Tilden's withdrawal by June 1884, and Randall felt free to pursue his own chance at the presidency. He gathered some of the Pennsylvania delegates to his cause, but by the time the convention assembled in July, most of the former Tilden adherents had gathered around New York governor Grover Cleveland. Early in the convention, Randall met with Daniel Manning, Cleveland's campaign manager, and soon thereafter Randall's delegates were instructed to cast their votes for Cleveland. As his biographer, House, wrote, the \\"actual bargain struck between Randall and Manning is not known, but... events would seem to show that Randall was promised control of federal patronage in Pennsylvania.\\" Cleveland's campaign made extensive use of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats did not want to lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885. Resisting tariff reform As the 49th Congress gathered in 1885, Cleveland's position on the tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans and the rest of the Democratic caucus rejected it. Declining influence Posthumous portrait of Randall by William A. Greaves, 1891 The tariff fight continued into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of the House, with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as much in favor of tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889. Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff bill could be considered a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats. Death Randall's grave in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia Randall's positions on tariffs and pensions had made him, according to The New York Times, \\"a practical Republican\\" by 1888. Voting with the opposing party so frequently was an effective tactic, as he faced only token Republican opposition for reelection that year. Randall's health continued to decline. When the new congress began in 1889, he received special permission to be sworn into office from his bed, where he was confined. The new Speaker, Republican Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, appointed Randall to the Rules and Appropriations committees, but he had no impact during that term. On April 13, 1890, Randall died of colon cancer in his Washington home. He had recently joined the First Presbyterian Church in the capital, and his funeral was held there. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Elected every two years from 1862 to 1888, Randall was the only prominent Democrat continuously on the national scene between those years. In an obituary, the Bulletin of the American Iron and Steel Association described the congressman who had consistently protected their industry: \\"Not a great scholar, nor a great orator, nor a great writer, Samuel J. Randall was nevertheless a man of sterling common sense, quick perceptions, great courage, broad views and extraordinary capacity for work.\\" The only scholarly works on his life are a master's thesis by Sidney I. Pomerantz, written in 1932, and a doctoral dissertation by Albert V. House, from 1934; both are unpublished. His papers were collected by the University of Pennsylvania library in the 1950s and he has been the subject of several journal articles (many by House), but awaits a full scholarly biography.

Fox was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1966, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent James Mills by 836 votes in the east-end Winnipeg riding of Kildonan (he had previously defeated Russell Doern to win his party's nomination). Along with most other members of the NDP caucus, he supported Edward Schreyer's bid to become party leader in 1968‚Äì69. The NDP scored an upset victory in the provincial election of 1969, and Fox was easily returned in Kildonan. He was appointed Speaker of the Legislature on August 7, 1971, and retained the position until the NDP were defeated in the 1977 election. He was re-elected without difficulty in the 1973 election, but faced a surprisingly strong challenge from PC candidate James Hanson in 1977. Following Schreyer's resignation as party leader in 1979, Fox was one of eight NDP MLAs who supported the election of Sidney Green as interim leader. He does not appear to have been a strong supporter of Howard Pawley, Schreyer's successor, but unlike Green and some others did not leave the party during the 1980s. Following electoral redistribution, Fox was re-elected in the new riding of Concordia in the 1981 provincial election. He was not appointed to cabinet, and did not seek re-election in the 1986 provincial election. In late 1986, he was appointed Vice-Chair of the Highways and Transportation Department Licence Suspension Board. He served as a director on Winnipeg's Industrial Development Board and served on the board for Winnipeg Hydro. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 68.

He was also the 47th Governor of Maryland from 1912 to 1916 and Comptroller of the Maryland Treasury from 1898 to 1900. Early life and career Goldsborough was born in Princess Anne, Maryland and was educated in public and private schools. While working as a clerk for the United States Navy, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1886, commencing practice in Cambridge, Maryland soon thereafter. He also held an interest in banking. In 1893 he married Mary Ellen Showell (c. 1865 - 1930) and they had two sons: Brice W. Goldsborough; and Phillips Lee Goldsborough II. In 1891 and in 1895, Goldsborough was elected state's attorney for Dorchester County, Maryland. In 1897, he was elected to the position of comptroller of the treasury of Maryland, but was defeated for reelection in 1899 by Dr. Joshua W. Hering. , he is the last Republican to have served as Maryland Comptroller. He was appointed collector of internal revenue for the district of Maryland in 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt and later by President William Howard Taft. Governor of Maryland Over time, Goldsborough built a large base of support in the state, which encouraged him to run for Governor of Maryland in 1911. He defeated Democratic challenger Arthur P. Gorman, Jr., becoming only the second Republican governor in state history up to that time. Goldsborough's tenure as governor saw a great deal of education reform, including the appointment of school boards and teacher certification. It was also during his tenure that the state purchased the Maryland Agricultural College, which is now the University of Maryland, College Park. Goldsborough United States Senate Goldsborough sought the Republican nomination for the Class I U.S. Senate seat from Maryland in 1916, but was defeated in the Republican primary by Joseph I. France. He left politics afterwards and resumed his law practice in Cambridge, and also became president of the National Union Bank. When Republican Herbert Hoover was elected President of the United States, Goldsborough again sought the same senate seat in Maryland. He was elected to the United States Senate in the election of 1928, defeating incumbent William Cabell Bruce. Later career and death In 1934, he was not a candidate for re-election to the senate, but instead ran again for Governor of Maryland. He lost in the Republican primary to Harry W. Nice, who went on to win the general election. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed Goldsborough to the director's board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1935. He served in that position until he died in 1946 in Baltimore, Maryland, and is buried in the old churchyard of Christ Episcopal Church of his hometown of Cambridge.

Early life Edwin Warfield was born to Albert G. Warfield and Margaret Gassaway Warfield at the \\"Oakdale\\" plantation in Howard County, Maryland. He received early education at the public schools of Howard County and at St. Timothy's Hall (formerly an Episcopal Church institution, now known as St. Timothy's School) in Catonsville, Maryland, a \\"streetcar suburb\\", southwest of Baltimore in Baltimore County. In 1877 he became a professor at Maryland's Agricultural College. Although Maryland was a Union State, many families were southern sympathizers, two of Warfield's brothers served in the Confederate States Army. Gassaway Watkins Warfield died at Camp Chase, and Albert G Warfield Jr. survived the conflict. After the abolition of slavery in the United States, Warfield had to return home frequently to help run his family's estate. He also spent time as a teacher in the county schools, and, in his spare time, studied for admission to the bar. Warfield founded The Daily Record as a court/legal proceedings, financial/commercial and business newspaper in 1888. It has continued into the 21st Century along with a corresponding \\"Warfield's\\" magazine published during the 1980s-90's. By his father, he was a third cousin to the Duchess of Windsor (originally named/n√©e Bessie Wallis Warfield, later Wallis Warfield Simpson of Baltimore), wife of the abdicated king of the United Kingdom, King Edward VIII, later Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor in 1936-1937, which gained world-wide attention and coverage, seventeen years after the former Governor's death.Luther W. Welsh. Ancestral Colonial Families, Independence, Missouri: Lambert Moon Print Company, 1928. Warfield's lineage also allowed him membership into the Sons of the American Revolution, where he served as 8th President General from 1902 until 1903. Political career In 1874, Warfield was appointed to the office of Register of Wills for Howard County to fill a vacancy. He was elected to a full six-year term the following year, and served until 1881. He was appointed to the Maryland Senate following the resignation of Arthur Pue Gorman to accept a higher office, was re-elected in 1883, and served as President of the Maryland State Senate during the 1886 session. While in the Senate, Warfield began his own law practice in Ellicott City, Maryland, and purchased the Ellicott City Times, where he served as editor from 1882 to 1886. He also founded a bank in the town where he worked until 1890. During the 1884 Presidential election, Warfield made significant contributions to the campaign of the 22nd (and later also 24th) President Grover Cleveland in Maryland, the first Democratic president to be elected since before the Civil War. Following the election, Cleveland appointed Warfield to serve as Surveyor of the Port of Baltimore beginning April 5, 1885. Warfield served in that position until May 1, 1890, after the Republicans returned to power. In 1890, Warfield married Emma Nicodemus, with whom he had three daughters and one son. In 1890, after his removal from Surveyor, Warfield founded the Fidelity and Deposit Company, where he served as president until his death. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1896 Democratic National Convention, but otherwise remained out of politics for nearly a decade. In September 1903, because of his political and historical interests, Warfield served as the main speaker and orator for the ceremonies dedicating the Lt. Col. William H. Watson (1808-1846) Monument. Governor of Maryland Gov. Warfield leading the 3rd Brigade of the Maryland National Guard in the inaugural parade of 26th President Theodore Roosevelt on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., photographed by William H. Rau on March 4, 1905 Warfield chose to run for Governor of Maryland in 1899, but lost the Democratic nomination after he was opposed by influential Maryland politicians, including Arthur Pue Gorman, a powerful U.S. Senator who had his own state political machine and was allied to similar interests and \\"old pols\\" in Baltimore City. However, even though it was apparent the party bosses did not hold him in favor, he again sought the nomination in 1903 openly discouraging African-Americans' ability to vote. He was successfully nominated by the party, and defeated his Republican opponent, Stevenson A. Williams, by over 12,600 votes. He was inaugurated as the 45th Governor of the \\"Old Line State\\" on January 13, 1904. The most significant event of his tenure as Governor came when Arthur Pue Gorman, who had opposed Warfield's election, proposed the \\"Gorman Amendment\\" to the Maryland State Constitution of 1867, which would have effectively disenfranchised all black voters in the state. The bill easily passed the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, but Warfield refused to sign the bill into law. While Warfield was in favor of some of the bill's provisions, such as denying the vote to the less-educated black voters of the state, he feared it would eventually lead to greater levels of disenfranchisement which could threaten all voters in the state. The bill was put before the public, and was defeated by 30,000 votes, a defeat to the crypto-segregationists in the party in which Warfield played a major role in. Warfield's actions in this affair further alienated him from the Democratic machine in Maryland, which was openly hostile towards him by the time he left office. As governor, Warfield also favored the establishment of direct-voting for U.S. Senators. He argued this before the General Assembly in 1906, believing the power should be in the hands of the people. The direct election of senators eventually became national law with the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Other accomplishments as governor included the authorization and approval in 1904 of an official state Flag of Maryland, (by using the design and colors on the shield of the Calvert family's coat-of-arms with a red-and-white cross with bottony (trefoil) ends of the Crosslands and the black-and-gold chevrons of the Calverts, each in two alternating quarters, like the shield. During the previous Civil War, the severely divided Border State used the two elements of the Maryland shield to represent their side of the War, (Unionists wore black/gold chevrons and Confederate Marylanders wore badges with red/white crosses on their uniforms. The return of a quartered flag and seal and shield represented a reuniting of the \\"Old Line State\\" and was fostered by the newly re-organized militia as the Maryland National Guard flying the new/old Maryland flag. Another historical \\"final act\\" was the success of a long search and process by the then U.S. Ambassador to France to discover the where-abouts in Paris, France of an American naval hero's burial site and have the return of the body of American Revolutionary War Captain John Paul Jones, (1747-1792), considered the father of the United States Navy to the specially-prepared marble crypt under the newly constructed domed chapel at the U. S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Also the western expansion and annex construction (with two new marble chambers for the houses of the General Assembly of Maryland) along with the remodeling of the old Maryland State House on State Circle, including the Old Senate Chamber to match its original Colonial appearance when General George Washington resigned his position in the Continental Army at the State House in December 1784, then serving as a temporary national capitol with the Confederation Congress then meeting there. Warfield left office in January 1908. Later life and legacy After his tenure as governor, Warfield returned to his previous activities. He became president of the Fidelity Trust Company with Baltimore Sun Publisher Van Lear Black. He served on the board of the Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company until his death. In addition to retaining his presidency at the Fidelity and Deposit Company. He was a prominent member of the Maryland Club and also served as President of the Maryland Historical Society. Warfield was proud of his families Confederate legacy, representing Maryland in reunions and events like the 1911 Southern commercial congress in Atlanta. Warfield's health began to deteriorate in late 1919, and he was confined to his home in Baltimore during the last few months of his life. He died there, and was interred in his family burial ground at \\"Cherry Grove\\" in Howard County. Warfield was eulogized by The Sun of Baltimore not as a man who made definitive accomplishments, but for standing up to the Democratic machine and supporting the public interest, and for transforming the office of the governor into a more modern institution responsible to the public, not the party. On 23 September 1948, Edwin Warfield Jr. commemorated a memorial at the Howard County Courthouse to honor the Confederate soldiers from Howard County. In Columbia, Maryland, Governor Warfield is remembered with a street named for him, Governor Warfield Parkway. In 1914, a dredge named the Gov. Warfield helped to dig the Cape Cod Canal in Massachusetts.

Carr was a member of the Cabinet of Canada as Minister of Natural Resources from 2015 to 2018 and Minister of International Trade Diversification from 2018 to 2019.Full list of Justin Trudeau's Cabinet, CBC News. Retrieved on November 4, 2015. He previously was a member of the Manitoba Legislature from 1988 to 1992 for the Manitoba Liberal Party. Biography Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Carr is a descendant of Jewish immigrants who arrived from Russia in 1906. He had his bar mitzvah at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue (Winnipeg) in 1964 and was educated at the University of Winnipeg, the University of British Columbia and McGill University. He worked as a journalist, musician and administrator, and served as both an oboist and trustee with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra on different occasions. On June 3, 1969, Carr and four other Young Liberals joined the New Democratic Party of Manitoba so as to support Sidney Green's unsuccessful bid to lead the party. He later returned to the Liberals. During the early to mid 1990s, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Winnipeg Free Press. Before entering public life, he was also executive director of the Manitoba Arts Council. Provincial politics Carr first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1986, losing to Progressive Conservative leader Gary Filmon in the upscale west Winnipeg riding of Tuxedo. He ran again in the provincial election of 1988 during a period of increased support for the provincial Liberals, and scored a surprisingly strong victory in the riding of Fort Rouge, defeating NDP cabinet minister Roland Penner by over 2,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government after this election, and Carr became Deputy Leader of the official opposition party. Following redistribution, Carr sought re-election in the 1990 provincial election in the riding of Crescentwood, where he defeated Progressive Conservative Tom DeNardi by 1,310 votes. The Liberals fell from twenty seats to seven in this election; Carr resigned his seat in February 1992. Post-provincial politics In 2016. From 1992 to 1997, Carr was on the editorial board of the Winnipeg Free Press. In 1998, he became president and CEO of the Business Council of Manitoba, an organization which he co- founded and stayed with until 2015. Carr was also a board member on the Canada West Foundation and the Winnipeg Airports Authority, as well as vice-president of the Performing Arts Consortium of Winnipeg, and a director of the Manitoba Arts Stabilization Fund. Carr has also been active in the Canadian Jewish Congress. In July 2011, Carr was awarded the Order of Manitoba. In his role as the President of the Business Council of Manitoba, Carr advocated for a temporary increase to the PST by 1% to assist municipalities with their infrastructure deficits.http://www.businesscouncil.mb.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=185:find- courage-and-bite-the-bullet&catid;=55:articles&Itemid;=105 In 2006, he advocated for the province to reduce its health costs, which reached as high as 42 per cent of the provincial government's expenses, and for government officials to keep an open mind to options that included privatization. \\"Everything is worth studying, and it's studied everywhere around the world. There are advances that have been made in other places, with cultures similar to our own, that could be applied here,\\" said Carr.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/business-group-urges-province-to- consider-health-care-privatization-1.577926 In this role, he also participated in the Winnipeg Consensus, which began with an unprecedented meeting held in October 2009, bringing together diverse organizations who agreed a national dialogue and a Canadian Clean Energy Strategy was needed on the role of energy in Canada's environmental and economic future. Federal politics In January 2014, Carr was announced as a candidate for the Liberal nomination in the federal riding of Winnipeg South Centre. He went on to win the nomination meeting and was declared the Liberal candidate for the 2015 federal election. He won the subsequent election on October 19, 2015 with 59.7 per cent of the vote. Two weeks later on November 4, 2015, Carr was officially sworn into the cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/full-list-of-justin-trudeau-s- cabinet-1.3300699. Retrieved on November 4, 2015.  Minister of Natural Resources  Carr's earlier work on the Winnipeg Consensus formed the basis for Generation Energy, his signature initiative as Minister of Natural Resources, launched in April 2017. This began a national dialogue on Canada's energy future aimed at finding out how Canadians want to meet Canada's climate goals, create jobs and keep energy affordable. More than 380,000 people engaged in the dialogue through online platforms and in-person roundtables, including the Generation Energy Conference held in Winnipeg with more than 650 participants from across Canada and around the world. The ideas that came from the dialogue resulted in billions of dollars of investments in electric vehicles and alternative fuels, smart grids, clean energy solutions for rural and remote communities, energy efficient buildings and emerging renewable power solutions. Carr worked closely with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, to develop the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF). He oversaw the efforts of his department to implement 30 of the 50 identified actions under the PCF, including many of the investments named above. In this role, Carr also represented Canada at the June 2016 Clean Energy Ministerial and Mission Innovation, where he announced the federal government will \\"double its spending on clean-energy research to $775-million by 2020, and look for ways to boost the commercialization of the emerging technology.\\" Carr then laid the groundwork for Canada to host the Clean Energy Ministerial/Mission Innovation in Vancouver in May 2019, which will showcase Canada's efforts to boost women in energy, Indigenous clean energy entrepreneurship and launch Canada's Energy Vision based on the results of the Generation Energy initiative. On February 11, 2016, as Natural Resources Minister, Carr purchased seven tickets to a NHL game featuring the Winnipeg Jets versus the Boston Bruins. His guests included the energy ministers and ambassadors from the United States and Mexico. It was later revealed Carr expensed $1,258.25 for the tickets and $525.30 for limo transportation from the Fort Garry Hotel to Winnipeg's MTS Centre arena. A spokesperson for Carr's office stated that the spending was in line with treasury board directives on hospitality and provided an opportunity for discussions in advance of an energy summit the following day.https://globalnews.ca/news/2819889/liberal-minister-jim-carr-spends- nearly-1800-on-hockey-outing/  Minister of International Trade Diversification  On July 18, 2018, Carr was shuffled from Minister of Natural Resources to the newly created position of Minister of International Trade Diversification. The addition of the word diversification to the title signaled a new focus on diversifying Canada's trade partners beyond the United States. It also furthered the work of his predecessor in welcoming more inclusive trade, where more Canadians are encouraged to participate in international trade and investment, including owners of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and businesses owned by often underrepresented Canadians, such as women, Indigenous peoples, youth and those who identify as LGBTQ2. In a November 2018 speech at the Toronto Region Board of Trade, Carr described the reason for the focus on diversifying those represented in Canada's international trade: \\"The more Canadians we have taking advantage of trade, the more wealth we can create here at home. Diversification is a national imperative. Trade diversification is a critical plank to our competitiveness.\\" In this role, Carr oversaw the expansion of Canada's Trade Commissioner Service (TCS), which helps Canadian businesses find customers in other countries. The Fall 2018 Economic Statement dedicated $1.2 billion towards the Trade Diversification Strategy, helping Canadians export around the globe. This included $290 million over five years towards the TCS and a $100 million expansion of the CanExport program, which supports Canadian entrepreneurs looking to export. This includes broadening opportunities for Canadian businesses to reach the 500 million consumers in European markets under the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), with the addition of 11 new trade commissioners across the EU, including enhanced presence in Milan. In Canada, Carr announced the reopening of the TCS regional hub office in Winnipeg, which serves Canadian exporters in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Carr oversaw initiatives to help close socio-economic gaps and create a trade environment where more Canadians can participate, including: * Leading the first-ever government-led LGBTQ2 trade mission, at the NGLCC International Business Leadership Conference in Philadelphia in August 2018 * Expanding TCS resources across Canada to help connect Indigenous exporters to business opportunities abroad * Delivering on a commitment to conduct a Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) as part of discussions towards a free trade agreement with Mercosur, marking ‚Äúthe first time such an analysis has been conducted on an ongoing free trade negotiation anywhere in the world‚Äù In his time as Minister of International Trade Diversification, Carr welcomed the entry into force of one multilateral (CPTPP) and two bilateral (Chile and Israel) free trade agreements. The Canada-USA-Mexico agreement negotiations were concluded by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chrystia Freeland. Under Carr, negotiations continued with three other trading blocs: Mercosur, ASEAN and the Pacific Alliance. = Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) = Soon after he was sworn in, Carr picked up the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) file. Moving swiftly to ensure early preferential access for Canadian businesses, Carr and his government made the ratification of CPTPP in Canada a top priority, moving it though parliament in record time. Implementing legislation for the CPTPP, Bill C-79, was introduced for debate in the House of Commons by his predecessor on June 14th, 2018. Carr introduced its second reading three months later, on September 17th. Bill C-79 received royal assent on October 25th and Carr announced four days later that Canada was officially the 5th CPTPP country to ratify the agreement. In Carr's words, the CPTPP legislation was introduced and moved \\"with a speed reflecting the importance of the CPTPP to farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and workers across Canada.\\" By becoming one of the first six countries to ratify the agreement, Canada joined Australia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore in bringing the agreement into force on December 30, 2018. He attended the inaugural meeting of the CPTPP commission on January 19th, 2019, in Tokyo, Japan. Carr and his predecessor, Francois-Philippe Champagne, marked the entry into force of the CPTPP with business owners and exporters at the Port of Vancouver on February 11th, 2019. With the implementation of the CPTPP, and therefore free trade with Japan, Canada then became the only G7 country with trade agreements with all six other G7 partners. = Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA) = On February 4, 2019, Carr met with Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Roberto Ampuero to mark the entry into force of the modernized Canada- Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA). The CCFTA was updated from its 1997 version, and is notable for making Canada the first G20 country to have a free trade agreement with a chapter on trade and gender. In welcoming the modernization, Carr said: ‚ÄúThis milestone agreement will help further encourage trade between Canada and Chile, by stimulating investment and creating new jobs. It has been modernized to reflect the Canadian economy of today, including the dynamic leadership that women continue to demonstrate as entrepreneurs and innovators.‚Äù = Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) = In the spring of 2019, the modernized Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) received royal assent, and Carr welcomed its entry into force on September 1st, 2019. CIFTA became the second Canadian free trade agreement to include a chapter on gender, and implemented additional components aimed at \\"creating conditions for trade where more people can participate and benefit from the wealth it creates. This means including more small and medium-sized businesses, defending workers‚Äô rights, encouraging the participation of women-owned businesses and protecting the environment.\\" = International Education Strategy = International education also falls under the purview of the Minister of International Trade Diversification. Carr unveiled Canada‚Äôs new International Education Strategy on August 22, 2019. It encourages more young Canadians to study and work abroad, including financial support for 11,000 students over 5 years through the Outbound Mobility Program pilot project, to be delivered by Colleges and Institutes Canada and Universities Canada. = Corporate Social Responsibility = In the area of corporate responsibility, Carr announced the appointment of Sheri Meyerhoffer as Canada's first Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) on April 8th, 2019. Ms. Meyerhoffer's mandate, described as a world first, is to \\"review allegations of human rights abuses arising from the operations of Canadian companies abroad\\" and to make recommendations. Her role focuses on the mining, garment, oil and gas sectors. According to the news release, \\"companies that do not cooperate could face trade measures, including the withdrawal of trade advocacy services and future Export Development Canada support.\\"  Second term  Carr was reelected to a second term as Member for Winnipeg South Centre in the 2019 federal election, winning 45% of the vote in a rematch with Joyce Bateman. Personal life On October 25, 2019, Carr issued a statement that having felt flu-like symptoms during the campaign, blood tests revealed shortly afterward that he had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Carr said that he would commence chemotherapy and dialysis treatment whilst remaining in the House of Commons. Carr is Jewish.

The university consists of four academic schools: School of Law, School of Business, School of Computer Science, and the School of Science and Engineering. The university is bilingual (English and Icelandic). History Reykjav√≠k University has its roots in the Commercial College of Iceland, School of Computer Science (TV√ç), which was founded in January 1988 and operated within the Commercial College of Iceland (V√ç) facilities for ten years. Reykjav√≠k University started its first semester on 1 September 1998, in a new building under the name Reykjav√≠k School of Business. TV√ç became one of two departments within the school. A name change was inevitable because the school's name was not descriptive for the variety of the school's operations. In January 2000, the name was changed to Reykjav√≠k University. In the autumn of 2002, the School of Law was established at Reykjav√≠k University and in 2005, Reykjav√≠k University was merged with the Technical University of Iceland (TH√ç) under the name Reykjav√≠k University. Following the merger, the School of Science and Engineering was established, partly built upon the old foundation of TH√ç with the addition of new engineering fields.

From 1899 to 1900, he was a U.S. congressman for the 1st district of Maryland; from 1900 to 1904, he was the 44th Governor of Maryland; and from 1908 to 1921, he served in the U.S. Senate, first as the junior senator for Maryland, and from November 1912 as the senior senator. Early life and career Smith was born at Snow Hill, Maryland, and attended private schools and Union Academy. His mother died when he was five weeks old, and his father died when he was five years old. Ephraim King Wilson , Smith's cousin, assumed guardianship of Smith, and raised him. He engaged in the lumber business in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina before becoming president of the First National Bank of Snow Hill and director in many business and financial institutions. Beginning his political career, Smith was elected to the Maryland State Senate in 1889, 1893, and 1897, and served as president of the Senate in 1894. Following the death of U.S. Senator to Maryland Ephraim K. Wilson in 1891, Smith sought to be elected to replace him, but lost nomination to fellow Democrat Charles H. Gibson. He was elected to the 56th Congress in 1898 from the 1st Congressional district of Maryland, but served for less than a year before being unexpectedly nominated for Governor of Maryland by the Democratic State Convention in 1899. Smith was victorious against incumbent governor Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. Governor of Maryland Portrait of Smith, 1904 As Governor, Smith promoted education, labor, and healthcare reform. In education, Smith reorganized the public school system, guaranteed free textbooks for all students, appointed a school superintendent, and removed the Agricultural College of Maryland (now known as the University of Maryland, College Park) from private control and placed it under the guidance of the State. He also improved the State's workmen's compensation program, encouraged a merit system for promotions, reorganized health laws and constructed a State psychiatric hospital. Governor Smith is also credited with signing into law the Certified Public Accountant Act, making Maryland the third state to create a Profession of Public Accounting with an exam, and state licensing and oversight. Smith also freed the State from much of its debt by the time he departed from the position in 1904. U.S. Senate After another unsuccessful attempt at a Senate election in 1904, Smith was elected in January 1908 to succeed William Pinkney Whyte whose term ended in 1909. When White died in March 1908, Smith was then also elected to finish the term. He was re-elected in 1914 and served from March 25, 1908, to March 3, 1921. He lost election in 1920 for a third term as Senator to Ovington E. Weller. As senator, Smith was chairman of the Committee to Investigate Trespassers Upon Land (62nd Congress), the Committee on the District of Columbia (63rd through 65th Congresses), and the Committee to Examine Branches of the Civil Service (66th Congress). Smith retired to private life and died in Baltimore, Maryland. He is buried in the Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Snow Hill, MD.

The Leverhulme Trust () is a large national grant-making organisation in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1925 under the will of The Rt. Hon. The 1st Viscount Leverhulme (1851‚Äì1925), with the instruction that its resources should be used to support \\"scholarships for the purposes of research and education.\\" It is based in London and is a registered charity under English law. Activities Since its foundation in 1925 the Trust has provided funding for research projects, fellowships, studentships, bursaries and prizes; it operates across all the academic disciplines, the intention being to support talented individuals as they realise their personal vision in research and professional training. With annual funding of some ¬£100 million, the Trust is amongst the largest all- subject providers of research funding in the UK. The Trust places special weight on: * the originality of the projects put to them; * the significance of the proposed work; * the ability to judge and take appropriate risk in the project; * the removal of barriers between traditional disciplines.  History  William Hesketh Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme (1851‚Äì1925), painting by William Strang (‚Ä† 1921), 1918. University of Liverpool Art Gallery and Collections. The Victorian businessman and entrepreneur William Hesketh Lever manufactured and marketed Sunlight soap. In order to produce the soap so cheaply, and so as to ensure he could undercut competition and be so prolific, he controlled large concessionary areas in the Congo. These were granted to him by King Leopold with whom he was a close friend. Many Congolese were exploited for use in forced labour which was allowed to continue for many decades before coming to light.Marchal, J. (2008). Lord Leverhulme's Ghosts: Colonial Exploitation in the Congo. London: Verso Books. Lever extended his business activities in ways that both served and profited from the rapid rise of a mass market for basic consumer products. He was also a philanthropist, supporting a variety of educational, religious, civic, community and medical causes. His achievements were recognised in 1922 when the title of Lord Leverhulme of the Western Isles was conferred upon him. On his death in 1925, Lord Leverhulme left a proportion of his interest in the company he had founded, Lever Brothers, in trust for specific beneficiaries: to include first certain trade charities and secondly the provision of \\"scholarships for the purposes of research and education\\". The Leverhulme Trust was established. In the succeeding years, Lever Brothers became a cornerstone of Unilever, a major multinational company, created in 1930 by the merger of Lever Brothers with Margarine Unie of the Netherlands. The Leverhulme Trust's shareholding thus became part of Unilever plc. November 1983 saw an evolution in the arrangements for the two charitable objectives. Subsequently, the Leverhulme Trust has been able to give concentrated attention to research and education. One special element in Viscount Leverhulme's legacy is the request that the Trustees all be drawn from the highest levels within Lever Brothers or now from its descendant Unilever plc. The Trust is therefore led by a group of colleagues with wide but self-consistent experience, with a high level of mutual understanding and respect built up over many years, and with a full recognition of the special qualities and achievement of the founder. The resulting culture for decision-making is free from disciplinary special interest but fully alert to the wide-ranging impact which research and education must make in modern life. Throughout its history, the Trust has combined the direct initiatives of the Trustees made in the light of specialist peer review advice together with a portfolio of awards made by a Research Awards Advisory Committee, itself comprising eminent research colleagues drawn predominantly from the academic world. The tradition continues to the present day.  Grant schemes  The Trust seeks to provide mechanisms for the support of researchers and students which can be effective at all stages in their careers; and currently offers the following schemes: ;Research Project Grants: Provide funds to employ research staff for up to five years on an innovative and original project of high quality and potential, the choice of theme and the design of the research lying with the applicant. ;Research Leadership Awards: These awards are available every three years. They support researchers who have succeeded in beginning a university career but who are then confronted with the task of building a research team adequately able to tackle an identified but distinctive research problem. Each UK institution is limited to one bid only. ;Study Abroad Studentships: Support up to two years of advanced study or research at a centre of learning in any overseas country, with the exception of the United States. ;Early Career Fellowships: Provide career development opportunities, of two or three years, for those who are at a relatively early stage of their academic careers but with a proven record of research. ;Research Fellowships: Provide support for up to two years for experienced researchers, particularly those who have been prevented by routine duties from completing a programme of original research. Awards are not limited to those holding appointments in higher education. ;International Academic Fellowships: Open to those holding a full-time post in a UK institution of higher education or comparable institution and support a period overseas in a stimulating academic environment for up to two years. ;Major Research Fellowships: Provide up to three years of full-time teaching replacement so that the applicant can concentrate on a piece of research, typically bringing it forward to publication as a monograph. ;Emeritus Fellowships: Provide support for up to two years of research to be conducted by the applicant following retirement from an academic post. ;Visiting Professorships: Enable distinguished academics based overseas to spend up to ten months at a UK university, primarily in order to enhance the skills of academic staff or the student body within the host institution. ;Philip Leverhulme Prizes: Awarded to outstanding scholars who have made a substantial and recognised contribution to their particular field of study, are recognised at an international level, and where the expectation is that their greatest achievements are yet to come. ;Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships: Support doctoral studies in UK universities and nurture the future generation of aspiring young researchers. Each award funds 15 Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarships at that institution. ;Arts Scholarships: Provide training opportunities across the whole range of artistic disciplines in the fine and performing arts. Arts Scholarships may be in the form of (a) Bursaries to enable individuals to develop their talent and/or (b) Innovative teaching awards to provide new and original training opportunities for the students concerned.

The Michigan Wolverines defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 9-3, earning the Big Ten Conference championship and a berth in the 1951 Rose Bowl. The game was one of the most noted in the storied history of the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State football rivalry. What was at stake The Big Ten Conference football championship in the 1950 college football season was on the line. The Wolverines were playing also for a berth in the 1951 Rose Bowl game. Ohio State had gone the previous year; the Big Ten Conference had a no-repeat rule regarding the Rose Bowl representative at that time. If Michigan had lost this game, the likely Rose Bowl representative would have been second place Wisconsin, which finished with a 5‚Äì2 record. If the game had not been played, which was a proposal put forth at game time, Ohio State would have been the Big Ten champion.The Snow Bowl: The Ohio State University Archives Game summary Harry Allis kicks the extra point after the game's only touchdown The game was played at Ohio Stadium, in Columbus, Ohio under severe weather that altered the normal playing of the game dramatically. The conditions were deplorable with the temperature at 10 degrees, winds gusting to 28 miles per hour out of the northwest and snow falling at two inches per hour. Snow banks lined the field, yard lines were obliterated and at times so, too, were the goal posts. Before the game, Ohio State coach Wes Fesler and OSU athletic director Dick Larkins went to talk to Michigan athletic director Fritz Crisler and coach Bennie Oosterbaan about whether or not to play the game. Neither Fesler nor Oosterbaan wanted to play the game and Crisler indicated that Michigan would forfeit but would not reschedule the game. Larkins would not accept the forfeit and the game proceeded as scheduled. The game was set to be played in front of 50,535 fans, some of whom built small bonfires in the stands to keep warm. Others sat with boxes over their heads to shield from the cold, with holes cut in to peer out. As the game was set to begin, grounds crews struggled to get the tarp off of the frozen field with four feet of snow on top of it. Local Boy Scouts and fans had to help with the tarps, finally removing them 2:21 hours late. Michigan won the game 9‚Äì3, despite never getting a first down, failing on all nine pass attempts and punting 24 times. The Buckeyes had just three first downs, passed for a total of 18 yards, rushed for 16 yards (11 fewer than U-M) and punted 21 times, four of which were blocked. Overall, the teams punted 45 times during the game, sometimes on first down based on the strategy that both teams felt it better to have the ball in the hands of their opponents near the end zone and hope for a fumble of the slippery ball. In the end, Ohio State Halfback Vic Janowicz (who went on to win the Heisman Trophy) punted for 685 yards while Michigan's Chuck Ortmann punted for 723 yards. The first score of the game came when Buckeye defensive guard Bob Momsen blocked an Ortmann punt and fell on it at the Michigan 8-yard line late in the first quarter of the game. The Buckeyes ran three straight running plays that went for minus-13 yards, putting the ball back to the 21. Janowicz was called upon to kick a 38-yard field goal into the swirling wind with the goal posts barely in view. He made it to give the Buckeyes a 3‚Äì0 lead. The kick would later be called one of the \\"Greatest Feats in American Sports\\" by a panel of sports writers. In the second quarter, Michigan tackle Al Wahl blocked a Janowicz punt deep in Ohio State territory. The blocked ball rolled out of the back of the end zone for a safety, giving Michigan their first score of the game and trimming the Buckeyes' lead to 3‚Äì2. Michigan scored what proved to be the winning touchdown when with 20 seconds remaining in the first half, Janowicz attempted a third down punt, only to have Michigan's Tony Momsen (brother of Ohio State's Bob Momsen) break through the line and block the punt. Momsen fell on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown and U-M kicked the extra-point to go up 9‚Äì3. OSU coach Fesler could have run another play instead of punting on third down and let the clock expire on the half, but he feared a fumble (there were 10 that day) that would be recovered as a touchdown by Michigan. Neither team would threaten to score again, and Michigan went on to win the game 9‚Äì3 and claim the conference title and chance to go to the Rose Bowl. The loss was Fesler's fourth straight to Michigan, and he submitted his resignation 18 days later. Fesler was replaced by Woody Hayes. Other uses The nickname has also been more recently used to refer to various other games, including the 2000 Independence Bowl, a 43‚Äì41 overtime win by Mississippi State over Texas A&M.; The 1992 meeting of Penn State and Notre Dame at Notre Dame Stadium is also sometimes referred to as the \\"Snow Bowl.\\" Heavy snow slowed both teams, with Notre Dame coming from behind to win, 17‚Äì16. The famous footage was filmed by two Ohio State University Employees, one being Professor Emeritus, Robert Wagner, who was the Chairman of the Department of Photography and Cinema.

Early life and education He was born in 1845 in Clarksburg, Virginia (now West Virginia), son of Lloyd Lowndes and Elizabeth Moore; he was a great-grandson of early Bladensburg, Maryland settler, Christopher Lowndes (1713‚Äì1785). He attended Allegheny College in Pennsylvania, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He graduated from the law department of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia in 1867. Marriage and family He married his first cousin, Elizabeth Tasker Lowndes, daughter of Richard Tasker Lowndes and Louisa Black. Political career After starting his law practice, Lowndes turned to politics. He found that the Democratic Party was regaining political control in Maryland. After being elected to one term in Congress in 1872, he did not succeed in gaining re-election after his term ended in 1875. He returned to his law practice. At the end of the century, however, Lowndes ran for governor in 1896, was supported by a strong Republican biracial coalition, and won the election.STEPHEN TUCK, ‚ÄúDemocratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century‚Äù (pdf), Spring 2013, reading for \\"Challenges of Democratization\\", by Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University In addition, Maryland was one of several \\"border states\\" that had voted for Republican candidate William McKinley in a major sweep that showed a realignment nationally;1896: McKinley v.

Consulted on October 7, 2011. According to Bloomberg News, the company's chief executive officer, Brian Camelio, founded ArtistShare in 2000 with the idea that fans would finance production costs for albums sold only on the Internet and Artists also would enjoy much more favourable contract terms. ArtistShare was described in 2005 as a \\"completely new business model for creative artists\\" which \\"benefits both the artist and the fans by financing new and original artistic projects while building a strong and loyal fan base\\". History ArtistShare founder Brian Camelio, singer Willie Nelson, and Blue Note Records President Bruce Lundvall on Willie Nelson's tour bus A United States-based company, ArtistShare (2001) is documented as being the first crowdfunding website followed later by sites such as Sellaband (2006), SliceThePie (2007), IndieGoGo (2008), Spot.us (2008), Pledge Music (2009), and Kickstarter (2009). ArtistShare projects have received 29 Grammy nominations and 10 Grammy awards to date. In 2005, American composer Maria Schneider's Concert in the Garden became the first album in Grammy history to win an award without being available in retail stores. The album was ArtistShare's first fan-funded project. Schneider received four nominations that year for the fan- funded album and won the Grammy for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. According to ArtistShare.com, ArtistShare artists consist of \\"some of today's most prestigious artists including Pulitzer prize and Oscar nominated writers, Guggenheim fellowship recipients and NEA Jazz Masters\\". In May 2013, ArtistShare partnered with Blue Note Records to form a collaboration titled 'Blue Note/ArtistShare'. The Blue Note/ArtistShare collaboration was forged by Brian Camelio, Bruce Lundvall, and Don Was, President of Blue Note Records. In Blue Note's press release about the collaboration, Lundvall, Blue Note Chairman Emeritus, is quoted as saying, \\"'ArtistShare founder Brian Camelio is a true visionary. I see the ArtistShare business model as a key component of the future music business'\\"Blue Note Records Retrieved October 24, 2013 The collaboration will \\"'essentially serve as a low-risk development arm of the label'\\" since the recordings will be funded by the fans.

For example, if an executioner offers the condemned the choice of death by being hanged, shot, or poisoned, all choices lead to death; the condemned is in a no-win situation. This bleak situation gives the chooser no room: whichever choice is made the person making it will lose their life. Less drastic situations may also be considered no-win situations - if one has a choice for lunch between a ham sandwich and a roast beef sandwich, but is a vegetarian or has a wheat allergy, that might also be considered a no-win situation. In game theory In game theory, a \\"no-win\\" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all of the following: * Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in text adventures. * Zugzwang, as in chess, when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before. * A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks each of which must be completed before the other or that are mutually exclusive (a Catch-22). * Ignorance of other players' actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the prisoner's dilemma). In history Carl von Clausewitz's advice (never to launch a war that one has not already won) characterizes war as a no-win situation. A similar example is the Pyrrhic victory, in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started. Looking at the victory as a part of a larger situation, the situation could either be no-win, or more of a win for the other side than the one that won the \\"victory\\", or victory at such cost that the gains are outweighed by the cost and are no longer a source of joy. For example, the \\"victorious\\" side may have accomplished their objective, but the objective may have been worthless, or they may lose a strategic advantage in manpower or positioning. (One example is Great Britain in WWII, where Britain was one of the victorious powers, but found itself so exhausted in the process as to no longer be able to maintain its great power status in a world now dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.) A related concept is sometimes described as winning the battle but losing the war, where a lesser (sub-) objective is won but the true objective beyond it is not well pursued and is lost. In past Europe, those accused of being witches were sometimes bound and then thrown or dunked in water to test their innocence. A witch would float (by calling upon the Devil to save her from drowning), and then be executed; but a woman not a witch would drown (proving her innocence but causing her death).BBC - h2g2 - Matthew Hopkins, 'Witchfinder General' of East Anglia  In video games  Unwinnable is a state in many text adventures, graphical adventure games and role-playing video games where it is impossible for the player to win the game (either due to a bug or by design), and where the only options are restarting the game, loading a previously saved game, wandering indefinitely, or a game over (negative game end, such as death). It is also known as a dead end situation or a softlock. Usually, this is the result of the player's previous choices, and not due to the game itself lacking a path to victory. For example, in games such as Goldeneye 007, Perfect Dark, and TimeSplitters, the level does not end once a player fails an objective short of being killed, but it is impossible to progress to the next level no matter what the player does afterwards. Other games take steps to avoid unwinnable situations; for example, a game may not allow players to drop items which are necessary to continue. Softlocks can be triggered by incorrect manipulation of game code or mechanics, as seen in speedrunning - should a certain sequence of tasks to perform a sequence break be carried out incorrectly, the game may become softlocked, forcing either a restart of the game or the console altogether. Unwinnable should not be confused with unbeatable, which is used to describe a character, monster, or puzzle that is too powerful or difficult to be overcome by the player or character at a lower standing, and is normally found in role-playing video games. In many cases, \\"unbeatable\\" gamestates occur because of integer overflow or other errors programmers did not take into account, called a kill screen. In this situation, the game may also crash.  In other media  In the film WarGames, the supercomputer WOPR simulates all possible games of tic-tac-toe as a metaphor for all possible scenarios of a nuclear war, each of them ending in a nuclear holocaust (mutual assured destruction). The computer then exclaims, \\"A strange game; the only winning move is not to play.\\" In the Star Trek canon, the Kobayashi Maru simulation is a no-win scenario designed as a character test for command track cadets at Starfleet Academy. It first appears in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. In the film, Admiral James T. Kirk states that he does not believe in the no-win scenario. In the TV show Quantico, the agents are put in a terrorist hijack flight simulation mission that is unbeatable.

The separate components are packed for sale in cartons which also contain assembly instructions and sometimes hardware. The furniture is generally simple to assemble with basic tools such as screwdrivers, which are also sometimes included. Ready-to- assemble furniture is popular with consumers who wish to save money by assembling the product themselves. Producers and merchants benefit from selling ready-to-assemble furniture because furniture is bulky once assembled, and thus more expensive to store and to deliver. Since the assembly work is done by the consumer instead of by the manufacturer, its price can be lower. A furniture assembly service industry has developed, making it easy for consumers to employ someone knowledgeable to assemble their furniture for them. History Ready-to-assemble furniture has roots that extend back a long way, as cabinetmakers have been making furniture that is easy to disassemble for transport for centuries. The New American Cyclopaedia of 1859 listed the assembly of furniture as an \\"American invention\\"Ripley, George; Anderson, Charles Anderson (1859). The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge, Volume 8. New York: Appleton. p. 30. Retrieved 31 August 2016. that emphasized ease of transport, but this claim is rather vague. A better claim to the earliest RTA furniture is the Thonet No. 14 bentwood chair, which was specifically made to be easily disassembled to save space during transportation.Murphy, Adrian (5 November 2019). \\"The Chair Men: Gebr√ºder Thonet and the Number 14 Chair\\". Europeana (CC By-SA). Retrieved 2019-11-05. It was first produced in 1859. Slightly later there is an American patent of 1878 that defines some prefabricated furniture as follows: \\"The invention refers to a class of furniture in kit to be packaged and transported in pieces and assembled by specialized and unqualified people.\\" An early attempt at a business selling RTA furniture was set up by designer Louise Brigham and two partners during World War I. By 1915, Home Art Masters was offering RTA furniture kits at moderate prices through a mail-order catalog. The buyer received a set of parts that the company stated could be ‚Äúquickly put together and finished. Everything including instructions, furnished. A boy or girl can set it up.‚Äù Home Art Masters was short-lived and it is uncertain how many of their RTA furniture kits were ever sold. The next experiments in running an RTA business stem from the 1940s and 1950s. In the late 1940s, the Australian designer Frederick Charles Ward founded a mail-order RTA furniture business because he was disturbed by how little affordable furniture there was for people of modest means.Carter, Nanette. ‚ÄúBlueprint to Patterncraft: DIY Furniture Patterns and Packs in Postwar Australia‚Äù. Design History Foundation, n.d. In 1953, the Ohio cabinetmaker Erie J. Sauder received the first U.S. patent for RTA furniture for a table that could be assembled without either hardware or glue; he called it \\"snap-together\\" furniture.Combs, Heath E. ‚ÄúSauder to Offer Replica of First RTA Table‚ÄùForster, Matt. Backroads & Byways of Ohio: Drives, Day Trips & Weekend Excursions. Countryman Press, 2018. In the Scandinavian countries, the furniture kit may have been independently invented by Swedish technician Gillis Lundgren, who had the idea when trying to transport a table in his car. According to reports, he had to saw off the table's legs so he could put it inside the car and bring it home. He talked about the idea with his boss at IKEA, and IKEA started selling flat-pack furniture in 1956.

It had a population of 1,205 at the 2011 census. Etymology In Wensleydale, on the western bank of the River Ure, the name derives from the Anglo-Saxon \\"M√¶ssa's Ham\\", the homestead belonging to M√¶ssa. History Silver Street St Mary the Virgin church The Romans had a presence here, but the first permanent settlers were the Angles. Around 900 AD the Vikings invaded, burning and laying waste to the church. They also introduced sheep farming, for which the town is still known. Masham was historically a large parish in the North Riding of Yorkshire. As well as the town of Masham the parish included the townships of Burton-on-Yore, Ellingstring, Ellington High and Low, Fearby, Healey with Sutton, Ilton cum Pott and Swinton. In 1866 the townships became separate civil parishes. Masham Moor was an area of moorland to the west of the parish bordering the West Riding, common to the parishes of Masham and East Witton. It was divided between the parishes of Healey, Ilton cum Pott and Colsterdale in 1934. The area of the ancient parish, except Burton-on-Yore, was known as Mashamshire from the 12th century or earlier. St Mary's Church was most likely founded in the seventh century and stood somewhere near the present town hall on what used to be known as Cockpit Hill. The graveyard yielded 36 burials in a recent excavation. The present church ‚Äî while having some Anglo-Saxon stonework and the stump of an eighth-century prayer cross ‚Äî is mainly Norman with fifteenth-century additions. Masham was given to York Minster in the medieval period but, as the archbishop did not wish to make the long journey north to oversee the town's affairs, the parish was designated a peculiar. During the Middle Ages, Masham developed as a very small town with milling, mining, cloth making and tanning industries. The town received its first market charter in 1251. Masham's importance as a major sheep market is the reason for the large market place and its Georgian houses. The market originally thrived because of its nearness to Jervaulx and Fountains Abbeys, with their large flocks of sheep. From 1875 the town was served by the Masham branch of the North Eastern Railway. Passenger services were stopped in December 1930 with goods traffic continuing until 1963. The station was across the River Ure at Low Burton. On 5 July 2014 the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the town. Governance Masham is part of the electoral ward of Mashamshire. This ward stretches west to Colsterdale with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 2,350. The parish now shares a grouped parish council, known as Masham Parish Council, with Burton on Yore, Ellington High and Low, Ilton cum Pott and Swinton with Warthermarske. Community Masham market days are Wednesday, Saturday and Bank Holiday Monday with a Farmers' Market every first Sunday of the month from April to September. An annual Sheep Fair is held in September. The market place, the largest in the district, is tightly bordered on its south and west sides by ranges of two- and three-storey buildings. To the south-east, lies St. Mary's Church with its large yard. Black Sheep Brewery Theakston Brewery Although Masham is a relatively small town it has two working breweries, Black Sheep Brewery and Theakstons, situated only a few hundred yards from one another. The Black Sheep Brewery sponsors annual folk festivals. Previous performers have included Hugh Cornwell of The Stranglers. The town was also for a long time home to Lightfoot Brewery. this was bought by the Theakston family and closed in the 1920s. The Lightfoot brewery buildings are now used by Black Sheep. The Masham Steam Engine & Fair Organ Rally has held annually,Masham Steam Engine & Fair Organ Rally. Retrieved 5 January 2015 organised by the Masham Town Hall Association; it began in 1965 to raise money for the local town hall. The town holds an arts festival every two years. Transport The nearest railway stations are Thirsk and Northallerton both of which are on the East Coast Main Line; although the town was formerly served by a station on the Masham branch railway. Buses operate from Ripon and the town is on the A6108 road between Ripon, Leyburn, Richmond and Scotch Corner. The town is several miles west of the A1(M) motorway.

The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of Shallow Nation, the band's first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year the band's first full-length album, Serenity is the Devil, was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member. History Formation In 1997 Andy LaPlegua established the project, Icon of Coil, which was primarily a concept built around a logo, graphic design and music. Soon after the inception, the music soon turned out to be the most important part of the concept and LaPlegua invited Sebastian Komor, who he had worked with before on the project Sector 9, (now called Moonitor) in 1996, to work with him on the project as a live member. After just a couple of gigs and the release of IOC‚Äôs first single, \\"Shallow Nation\\", Seb became a full-time member. Shallow Nation (2000) Shallow Nation, released early in 2000, sold out the first thousand copies after only two weeks in the stores, which resulted in a deal with the Norwegian record label Tatra Records. Around that same time Tatra Records released the compilation Sex, Goth & Electronics, to which IOC contributed an exclusive version of their song \\"Repeat It\\". Before they started working on their second release IOC did programming for the Apoptygma Berzerk track \\"Starsign\\". Soon afterwards, they traveled to Germany, with live member Jon Holm, to support Apoptygma on their Welcome to Earth tour 2000 at their gigs in Frankfurt, Cottbus and Leipzig before going back to Norway to play together at Rockefeller in Oslo. One Nation Under Beat debuted in the top 20 on the DAC-chart (Deutsch Alternative Chart) for eight weeks and peaked at number three. In late spring of 2000 at a gig in Uddevalla, Sweden, Christian Lund joined the band as a live-member and went on stage with Andy and Seb for the first time. Along with being the vocalist for his En Route project, Christian had a background from a melodious EBM Fredrikstad-band called Elected By Fear where he played together with Fredrik Hansen from Echo Image (who also played at that gig) and Marius Johnsen from Centravibe. Serenity is the Devil (2000‚Äì2001) After the release of IOC's first full-length Serenity is the Devil in November 2000, which reached number three on the DAC-chart, the band went to Germany together with Beborn Beton. With nine gigs, positive feedback from the audience and very good reviews on the debut album, IOC gained a following in the synth/industrial scene. Shortly afterward, the album crossed the Atlantic and was released in North America by Metropolis Records. On March 29, 2001, the band itself followed and boarded a plane to Chicago. The song Situations Like These from the (then) forthcoming Seren EP was played live for the first time to an American audience. The summer started with a successful show in Leipzig, Germany, at Wave-Gotik-Treffen. The following festivals included CSD, Zillo Festival, Xtreaktor Festival, Eurorock, Infest and ended at M'era Luna. Situations Like These became a big club hit and the band was ready for a second tour (this time in a Nightliner touring bus) of North America with VNV Nation. The leg began in Chicago on the 16th of November. Icon of Coil, VNV Nation and the rest of the crew continued up to Canada, down the east coast to Florida, through Texas to the West coast and Hollywood, where they did their 15th show. The four-week tour ended in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The Soul is in the Software (2002) During their tours, the band found the time to write material for their second album, The Soul is in the Software, which was released in April 2002 and stayed at number one on the DAC for several weeks. IOC then performed at two more festivals: The Dark Jubilee Festival in London, and later as the Sunday headliner for Synthpop Goes the World in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Machines Are Us (2004) and Uploaded And Remixed (2004) In 2004, their third album, Machines Are Us, was released. Icon of Coil then released their remix album Uploaded And Remixed at the tail end of 2004, which featured new mixes of songs from their first two records and two exclusive tracks. Present Icon of Coil have been reuniting sporadically for live performances. They announced at their recent Sydney show that they would be writing new material. On August 6, 2012, Icon of Coil released a new song, \\"PerfectSex\\", as a pay-what-you-want download on Bandcamp. A new studio album was reportedly in production. Most recently, in November 2015 IOC performed on the main stage at the Orus Fest in Mexico City. In December 2018, Icon of Coil performed dates across Germany.

Cliff Island is an island in Casco Bay Maine. It is part of the city of Portland, Maine. As of the 2000 census, the island had a year-round population of approximately 60 people. In the summer, the island's population grows to about 200, despite the fact that it is the only year-round inhabited island in Casco Bay with no paved roads. Originally named Crotch Island for its H-shape and natural harbors, the name was changed to end mail mix-ups with several other islands in Maine. In the early 20th century the island's inns were a draw for summer tourists. There are no hotels any longer, but many homes are available for weekly rentals or longer. While there are no public services, residents enjoy a community hall, a tennis court, baseball field, and playground. The residents are served by a USPS Post Office, fire department, and one-room school for elementary grades. While the postal service has considered closing the office in the past, the islanders have managed to keep it in operation for six hours a day. Transportation Looking back from Cliff Island ferry landing to channel between Hope Island and Long Island, MECliff Island residents (also known as Cliff Islanders) travel back and forth to the mainland via the Casco Bay Lines ferry service. The ride takes about one hour. Cliff Islanders mostly buy groceries in Portland, but there is a small store on the island. In the summer, tourists taking the ferry as a cruise often step off to enjoy an ice-cream or pizza at the caf√©. Bicycles, golf carts and electric carts are most often used for transportation. A barge ramp was added in 2008 to ease delivery of trucks and heavy items. In popular culture In 1987 the feature film The Whales of August was filmed entirely on location on Cliff Island. The buoy that was used in the film as a transitioning tool is now on display outside of the Casco Bay Lines Ferry Terminal.

The name Lafite comes from the surname of the La Fite family. Lafite was one of four wine-producing ch√¢teaux of Bordeaux originally awarded First Growth status in the 1855 Classification, which was based on the prices and wine quality at that time. Since then, it has been a consistent producer of one of the world's most expensive red wines. History Situated in the wine-producing village of Pauillac in the M√©doc region to the north-west of Bordeaux, the estate was the property of Gombaud de Lafite in 1234. In the 17th century, the property of Ch√¢teau Lafite was purchased by the S√©gur family, including the 16th century manor house that still stands. Although vines almost certainly already existed on the site, around 1680, Jacques de S√©gur planted the majority of the vineyard. In the early 18th century, Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de S√©gur refined the wine-making techniques of the estate, and introduced his wines to the upper echelons of European society. Before long he was known as the \\"Wine Prince\\", and the wine of Ch√¢teau Lafite called \\"The King's Wine\\" thanks to the influential support of the Mar√©chal de Richelieu. Towards the end of the 18th century, Lafite's reputation was assured and even Thomas Jefferson visited the estate and became a lifelong customer. Following the French Revolution, the period known as Reign of Terror led to the execution of Nicolas Pierre de Pichard on 30 June 1794, bringing an end to the S√©gur family's ownership of the estate which became public property. In 1797 the vineyards were sold to a group of Dutch merchants. The first half of the 19th century saw Lafite in the hands of the Vanlerberghe family and the wine improved more, including the great vintages of 1795, 1798 and 1818. In 1868 the Ch√¢teau was purchased by Baron James Mayer Rothschild for 4.4 million francs, and the estate became Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild. Rothschild, however, died just three months after purchasing Lafite. The estate then became the joint property of his three sons: Alphonse, Gustave and Edmond Rothschild. The 20th century has seen periods of success and difficulty, coping with post-phylloxera vines, and two world wars. During the Second World War the Ch√¢teau was occupied by the German army, and suffered heavily from plundering of its cellars. Succeeding his uncle √âlie de Rothschild, Lafite has been under the direction of √âric de Rothschild since 1974. At the 5 December 1985 Christie's auction, a new record price of approximately was paid for a bottle of wine a 1787 Ch√¢teau Lafite which was thought to be owned by Thomas Jefferson.GBP closed at ~$1.48 on the day of the auction per The authenticity of the bottle has been challenged.For the controversy, which is still unresolved, see On 29 October 2010 the record was broken at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong three bottles of 1869 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild were sold for (US$232,692) each. Counterfeiting  In early November 2012, police in the city of Wenzhou, China, seized nearly 10,000 bottles of suspected counterfeit Ch√¢teaux Lafite Rothschild. Lafite is very popular among China's nouveau riche, but analysts suspect that between 50 and 70 per cent of wine labeled \\"Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild\\" in China is fake. If genuine, the collection seized in Wenzhou would have been worth up to US$16 million. Vineyard The vineyard is one of the largest in the M√©doc at 107 hectares, and produces around 35,000 cases annually, of which between 15,000 and 25,000 are first growth. Its vines are around 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and 2% Petit Verdot, whereas the final wine is between 80% and 95% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% and 20% Merlot, and up to 3% Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Occasionally exceptions are made, such as the 1961 vintage which was 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. A second Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild vineyard was established in the Chinese province of Shandong, where 250,000 vine stocks from France are planted on 30 hectares. Its vines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Marselan. In 2019, the estate debuted its first vintage from its Domaine de Long Dai winery in Shandong.Barron's accessed November 13, 2019 Wines A dry white Bordeaux from one of the many second labels of the Lafite Rothschild family In addition to the first growth, around a third of the wine is released as a second wine under the label Carruades de Lafite.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine p. 90 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Price Across all vintages Lafite Rothschild is one of the most expensive wines in the world, with the average price per 750 ml bottle reaching $911. Prices for Carruades de Lafite rose dramatically due in part to Chinese demand, with the prices of its 2005 and 2000 vintage fetching over ¬£10,000 per case. After peaking in 2011, however, the price of some vintages halved in two years.

Known for the detailed dissection of Irish life found in works such as The Barracks, The Dark and Amongst Women, The Observer hailed him as \\"the greatest living Irish novelist\\" before his death in 2006 and in its obituary the Guardian described him as 'arguably the most important Irish novelist since Samuel Beckett'. Biography Born in Knockanroe about half a mile from Ballinamore, County Leitrim, John McGahern was the eldest child of seven. Raised alongside his six young siblings on a small farm in Knockanroe, McGahern's mother ran the farm (with some local help) whilst maintaining a job as a primary school teacher in the local school. His father, a Garda sergeant, lived in the Garda barracks at Cootehall in County Roscommon, somewhat sizeable distant away from his family at the time. McGahern's mother subsequently died of cancer in 1944, when the young John McGahern was ten years old resulting in the unrooting of the McGahern children to their new home with their father in the aforementioned Garda barracks, Cootehall. In the years following on from his mother's death, McGahern completed his primary schooling in the local primary school, and ultimately won a scholarship to the Presentation Brothers secondary school in Carrick-on-Shannon. Having travelled daily to complete his second-level education, McGahern continued to accumulate academic accolades by winning the county scholarship in his Leaving Certificate enabling him to continue his education to third level. Following on from his second level success, McGahern was offered a place at St Patrick's College of Education in Drumcondra where he trained to be a teacher. Upon graduation from third level education, McGahern began his career as a primary schoolteacher at Scoil Eoin B√°iste (Belgrove) primary school in Clontarf where, for a period, he taught the eminent academic Declan Kiberd. He returned to third-level education in University College Dublin where he graduated in 1957. He was dismissed from Scoil Eoin B√°iste on the order of the Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/parent-leaves- board-over-school-policy-1.1108700 He was first published by the London literary and arts review, X magazine,\\"The End or the Beginning of Love\\", X, Vol. II, No. I (March 1961). An extract from McGahern's first novel, The End or the Beginning of Love . The novel was never published. After his visit to London McGahern decided to re-work the novel into two novels: The Barracks (1963) and The Dark (1965). See Young John McGahern: Becoming a Novelist, Denis Sampson (OUP, 2012); \\"The extract in X attracted interest from a number of publishers. Fabers, among other publishers, wrote to me. T. S. Eliot was working at the firm then.‚Äù ‚Äì McGahern in an interview organized by Linda Collinge and Emmanuel Vernadakis for the JSSE 20th, anniversary celebration, 24 May 2003 which published in 1961 an extract from his first ‚Äì abandoned ‚Äì novel, The End or Beginning of Love. McGahern married his first wife, Finnish- born Annikki Laaksi, in 1965 and in the same year published his second novel, The Dark which was banned by the Irish Censorship Board for its alleged pornographic content along with its implied sexual abuse by the protagonist's father. Due to the controversy which was stirred by the book's publication McGahern was dismissed from his teaching post and forced to move to England where he worked in a variety of jobs (including on building sites) before returning to Ireland to live and work on a small farm near Fenagh in County Leitrim. He died from cancer in the Mater Hospital in Dublin on 30 March 2006, aged 71. He is buried in St Patrick's Church Aughawillan alongside his mother. Novels McGahern's six novels draw inspiration from some personal life experience detail the trials of developing an individual sense of self in Ireland of the mid-twentieth century. The early novels: The Barracks and The Dark His first published novel, The Barracks (published in 1963) chronicles the life of the barrack's Garda sergeant's second wife, Elizabeth Reegan who is in the decline of health due to cancer. The Barracks was adapted for the stage in 1969 by Hugh Leonard. His second book, The Dark tracks the progression of a young boy as he moves through the education system in rural Ireland. The main character, young Mahoney, while maintaining his academic prowess experiences a strained relationship with his father, old Mahoney ‚Äì who beats him and the other children ‚Äì as well as indecision about what to do with his life after secondary school. Young Mahoney's attitude towards his father evolves over the vast timespan covered within the novel from fear and hatred towards greater acceptance. Note: \\"The Barracks\\" and \\"The Dark\\" came from McGahern's re-writing of his first, unpublished, novel, The End or Beginning of Love.Young John McGahern: Becoming a Novelist, Denis Sampson (OUP, 2012). The End or Beginning of Love was never published in full but an extract was published in X magazine, Eds. Patrick Swift & David Wright, Vol. II, No. I (March 1961), which was McGaherns first appearance in print. Mid-career literature: The Leavetaking and The Pornographer The next novel, The Leavetaking introduces the reader to Patrick Moran, a young schoolteacher in Dublin. The novel is set during his last day in the school. He will be formally fired that night for having married a divorced non-Catholic woman during a leave of absence year. The novel is divided into two parts: both of which are essentially flashbacks. Part 1 covers the teacher's childhood up to the moment of his mother's death. Like McGahern himself, Patrick had promised his mother that he would become a priest and as he is unable or unwilling to do so instead becomes a schoolteacher (often referred to as \\"the second priesthood\\" in mid-twentieth century Ireland). Part 2 flashes back to how he came to meet his wife, how exactly the church authorities fire him, and his ultimate dismissal by the church authorities, the formal authority within Irish schools at the time. The book is a close reflection on McGahern's own experiences of being dismissed from his teaching post in the early 1960s for much the same reasons as Patrick Moran as well as the scandal caused by his second book, The Dark, with many sexual references. The Pornographer (published in 1975) details the life of the novel's protagonist who writes pornography for a living is now living in Dublin. He begins a sexual relationship with a young woman called Josephine and when Josephine subsequently becomes pregnant, the \\"pornographer\\" voices his contempt towards the birth of the baby, and indeed his relationship with the child's mother. The novel again covers the subject of death by cancer ‚Äì the writer's aunt in this case is dying in hospital ‚Äì as well as visits to rural Ireland. Back to the country: Amongst Women and That They May Face the Rising Sun (By The Lake) His fifth and perhaps McGahern's best known novel is Amongst Women which marks a return to the Roscommon/Leitrim setting after two Dublin/London books. It details the story of Michael Moran, an IRA veteran of the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, who now dominates his family in the unforgiving farmlands of County Leitrim, near Mohill. The book shows a detailed and understanding portrayal of a hardened, and unapologetically idealistic protagonist in the figure of an ageing Moran. An ex-IRA commander, Moran detests the \\"small-minded gangsters\\" who now run the country for which he fought. Though Moran's presence surely dominates the novel, the positive attributes of his stern moralism and sense of self-worth are passed on to his children, who become successful adults (both emotionally and financially) in both Dublin and London alike. Once again, it seems to fit into a sequence, with the progressive male character most closely reflected by Luke, who left home, emigrated to London, and refuses to get close his father again. One may view McGahern's portrayal of the Moran household as the house he left behind with the remaining kids being brought up by his father, his father's remarriage, and his young brother's struggles with his father and school. In 2015 the Guardian listed Amongst Women as 97 in its list of the 100 best novels. His final novel, That They May Face the Rising Sun which was published in 2001 (published in the United States as By the Lake) is a portrait of a year in the life of a rural lakeside community. The novel, explores the meaning in prosaic lives and life in (a now past life) in rural Ireland. He claimed that \\"the ordinary fascinates me\\" and \\"the ordinary is the most precious thing in life\\".John Mc Gahern speaking on RT√â radio programme Rattlebag in January 2002. The main characters have ‚Äì just like McGahern and his wife ‚Äì returned from London to live on a farm. Most of the violence of the father-figure has disappeared now, and life in the country seems much more relaxed and prosperous than in The Dark, or Amongst Women as McGahern now writes in a twenty-first century Ireland. Other writing McGahern is also considered a master of the Irish tradition of the short story. Several collections were published as well as Love of the World, a collection of non- fiction essays. His autobiography, Memoir (All Will be Well: a Memoir in the US), was published in 2005 a year before his death outlining numerous influential moments in his life which critics often speculated were present within his earlier work. Andrew Motion wrote \\"In a tremendously distinguished career, he has never written more movingly, or with a sharper eye\\". Influence McGahern's work has been very influential in Ireland and elsewhere. A younger generation of Irish writers, such as Colm T√≥ib√≠n, have been influenced by his writing. His work has been translated into many languages, in particular French. Awards and Honours McGahern was a member of the Irish Arts honorary organisation Aosd√°na and won many other awards (including the Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres). He was visiting professor at many universities including Colgate University and the University of Notre Dame (United States), University of Victoria (Canada), Durham University (UK), UCD and NUI Galway (Ireland).

The Acharonim follow the Rishonim, the \\"first ones\\"‚Äîthe rabbinic scholars between the 11th and the 16th century following the Geonim and preceding the Shulchan Aruch. The publication of the Shulchan Aruch thus marks the transition from the era of Rishonim to that of Acharonim. Consequences for Halakhic change The distinction between the Acharonim, Rishonim and Geonim is meaningful historically. According to the widely held view in Orthodox Judaism, the Acharonim generally cannot dispute the rulings of rabbis of previous eras unless they find support from other rabbis in previous eras. Yet the opposite view exists as well: In The Principles of Jewish Law Orthodox Rabbi Menachem Elon wrote: Hilkheta Ke-Vatra'ei can be interpreted in a way such that the Orthodox view does not constitute a contradiction, with an appeal to understand it within the greater context of Torah. While authority may go to the scholars of a later generation within a particular era, the Talmud does not allow scholars of a later era to argue with scholars of an earlier era without support from other scholars of an earlier era. This is displayed in ‚Äúhundreds of instances\\" in the Talmud in which Amora‚Äôim are challenged by Tanna‚Äôitic sources with the term ◊û◊ô◊™◊ô◊ë◊ô and the Amorai'm unable to ‚Äúdeflect the challenge‚Äù. An Amora called Rav is challenged by Tannai‚Äôtic sources ‚Äúand is vindicated by the statement, Rav tanna hu upalig‚Äù- ‚ÄúRav is a Tanna and disagrees (in Eiruvin 50b, Kesubos 8a, and elsewhere). Similar case for Rav China, a borderline Tanna in Bava Metzia 5a. This clearly implies that the only reason they are able to get away with disagreeing is because they are Tannaim. There are ‚Äúonly a handful of possible exceptions that the Amora‚Äôim did not, in fact argue with the Tanna‚Äôim.‚Äù The question of which prior rulings can and cannot be disputed has led to efforts to define which rulings are within the Acharonim era with precision. According to many rabbis the Shulkhan Arukh is from an Acharon. Some hold that Rabbi Yosef Karo's Beit Yosef has the halakhic status of a work of a Rishon, while his later Shulkhan Arukh has the status of a work of an Acharon.

It was originally used as a fishing ground by Abenaki Native Americans. Also known as Great Chebeague (pronounced \\"sha-big\\") Island, today it is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. It is located northeast of Portland, Maine. Chebeague Island is the largest island in Casco Bay that is not connected to the mainland by a bridge. The largest island is Sebascodegan, or \\"Great Island,\\" which is part of the Town of Harpswell and connected to the mainland by a bridge. Chebeague Island is one of the twelve major islands of the Calendar Islands, a term that originated in 1700 with the report by the English military engineer Wolfgang William R√∂mer, who claimed there were \\"as many islands as there are days in the year.\\" As a corrective, the Maine State Historian Robert M. York stated there are \\"little more than two hundred islands\\" in Casco Bay. Chebeague Island was a part of the Town of Cumberland until July 1, 2007, when it seceded and became the Town of Chebeague Island.NPR \\"Maine Island Celebrates New Independence\\" 2007-07-04. Accessed 2011-02-11. The Town of Chebeague Island includes seventeen islands and their adjacent waters. These include the islands of Bangs, Bates, Hope, Ministerial, Sand, Stave, Stockman, and the tiny Upper Green Islands. In the 2000 Census, the year-round resident population was 356. In the 2010 census, the town's year-round population of 341. The population is said to more than triple in the summer months. Chebeague Island is part of the Portland-South Portland- Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.  History  According to island lore, the name \\"Chebeague\\" evolved from Chebiscodego, the name used by members of the Wabanaki Confederacy, a First Nations and Native American confederation of five principal nations: the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki, and Penobscot. The most accepted definition of the word Chebeague is \\"Island of Many Springs.\\" Other sources state that Chebeague comes from the Abenaki words T‚ÄôCabie or Chebidisco, meaning cold spring, or Jabeque or Gaboag, meaning separated, which recognizes the connectedness of Great Chebeague Island and Little Chebeague Island. Great Chebeague Island was also known for a time as Recompense Island. The early Native American presence on the island was not year-round. During the summer months, Native Americans arrived by canoe to fish and gather shellfish for the winter months. Early settlers included Zachariah Chandler, who bought 650 acres in 1746. Other early settlers were Ambrose Hamilton and Deborah Soule Hamilton, who had fourteen children and seventy-two grandchildren, the majority of whom settled on Chebeague. The early white settlers cleared much of the island's land for farming. Lobsters were so plentiful that they were used as fertilizer for the fields. Early commerce on the island developed around fishing, farming, and the construction of \\"stone sloops,\\" ships that carried quarried granite down the eastern seaboard for the building of breakwaters, lighthouses, and set navigational markers. By the late 19th century and throughout the early 20th century, tourists from Canada, Boston, and points south began to visit Maine in a phenomenon sometimes known as the \\"rusticators\\" movement, where residents of New England's industrial cities sought to get back to nature for a few days or weeks.Woodard, Colin. The Lobster Coast . New York. Viking/Penguin, , 2004 The tourists filled the cottages, rooming houses, and inns, such as the Chebeague Island Inn, that dotted the islands of Casco Bay. In 1900, Chebeague Island had five hotels. Tourists arrived on steamboats from Portland.Frappier, William. Steamboat Yesterdays of Casco Bay. Stoddart, Canada, , 2000 320x320pxThe Chebeague High School closed in 1956; the schoolhouse, built in 1871, still stands and serves as a museum for Great Chebeague's history. The strong sense of community is highlighted in its summer months, where children often participate in the many camps offered on the island. Popular are the farm camp, clown camp, British Soccer Camp, theatre camp, and many others sponsored by the island's recreation center. Among the most popular is the Chebeague Island Sailing School, created by the island's yacht club. In the acclaimed camp, students learn about small boat sailing while enjoying the great waters that Casco Bay offers. Nearby Cousins Island is connected to the mainland by a bridge, and Great Chebeague has historically debated and entertained the idea of linking-up to the mainland or Cousins Island with a bridge of its own. The idea of building a bridge was last considered seriously in 1970, but was soundly voted down by islanders. In 1997, the people of Chebeague were a significant part of a movement that managed to overturn Nabisco's decision to discontinue the \\"Crown Pilot Crackers\\" from its product line. Due to its being such a tradition with the islanders as an accessory to their consumption of soup, an organized effort was created to bring the chowder cracker back. It was successful, so much so that not only was the Pilot Cracker made again, but it was turned into a media event, with Nabisco donating $1,000 to the Chebeague Historical Society. In 2002 Chebeague Island explored secession from Cumberland, with whom they had been tied for 184 years. The initiative gained traction after school district 51 considered downsizing the island elementary school. The island won independence from Cumberland after votes in the Maine Senate (31-3) and House of Representatives (131-1) on April 5, 2006. The separation took effect on July 1, 2007.One town's Independence Day: Maine island seceding from Portland suburb to secure its future, The San Diego Union-Tribune, 2007-06-30. Accessed 2008-06-25. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water. At approximately long and wide,U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps Chebeague is the largest unconnected island in Casco Bay. The northern tip of the island is called Chebeague Point and the southern tip is called Deer Point. Little Chebeague Chebeague Island is known as \\"Great Chebeague,\\" as it is not always a single landmass. The nearby island of \\"Little Chebeague\\" is accessible on foot, via a sandbar that appears at low tide. Being that there are many fresh-water underground springs and rivulets, low-tide exposed sandy areas such as the sandbar, or coves, often have \\"quicksand\\" zones that must be noted with caution. Little Chebeague, approximately 3/4 of a mile long, is uninhabited and mostly dense shrub and forest. It was used during World War II as the Fire Fighters School of the Portland Naval Training Center. It is now owned by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands as an undeveloped park where picnicking, camping and swimming are allowed, but no facilities are provided. Nearby Great Diamond Island and Little Diamond Island also share this low-tide event of having a \\"great\\" and a \\"small\\" island classification. Demographics 2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 341 people, 171 households, and 98 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 525 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 99.1% White, 0.3% African American, 0.3% Asian, and 0.3% from two or more races. There were 171 households, of which 18.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.1% were married couples living together, 5.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 2.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 42.7% were non-families. 37.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 19.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.99 and the average family size was 2.63. The median age in the town was 57.9 years. 15% of residents were under the age of 18; 4% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 14.1% were from 25 to 44; 32% were from 45 to 64; and 34.9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the town was 48.4% male and 51.6% female. Transportation Transportation to the island includes two ferry services. The Chebeague Transportation Company (CTC) makes the 15-minute run from Wharf Road on Cousins Island to the Stone Wharf on the north-west side of the island. Casco Bay Lines provides service on all mail boat and other \\"down- bay\\" trips that travel beyond Long Island, Maine. A water taxi also runs during the summer. One main macadam-paved road (with various different names, including North Road and South Road) loops around the island, with a few connecting paved or partly-paved roads in between, such as Schoolhouse Road, Roy Hill Road, and Littlefield Avenue.[4] Coming off the paved road, there are many unpaved roads going to residential homes and various points and beaches. The beaches are considered state land and anyone can walk on them, like state park property, thus the reason many of the smaller roads simply end at coastal points. Some of smaller \\"roads\\" are merely single-lane, rutted sand trails with heavy overgrowth to either side, and on the off-chance two cars meet coming at one another, one car must pull to the side or back up to a suitable area to allow the other to pass. Most residents have \\"island cars\\" that they use year-round; they take the abuse of rutted back roads with overgrowth that scratches the sides of vehicles, as well as the corrosive, briny Casco Bay air. Island cars are not required to have license plates, although they must be registered. Children of year-round residents take a boat back and forth to the mainland every day from the Stone Pier to go to middle and high school. Elementary-school-age children usually stay on the island to attend the school house, which houses grades K-5. Chebeague Island Casco Bay landing  Wildlife and nature  Deer, red fox, a variety of non-venomous snakes, raccoons, grey squirrels, frogs and toads, gray and black back gulls, loons, and ducks are all creatures that can be seen on and about the island. Curiously, no skunks are to be found on this, the second largest island in Casco Bay Mosquitoes can be a nuisance, and much of the island is soft, sandy, swampy soil (due largely in part to the many underground springs), which are perfect conditions for mosquito breeding. Harbor seals can often be spotted from the shores of Chebeague, swimming or sunning themselves on the rocks of nearby uninhabited islands or on depth-marker buoys. Occasionally one might spot a porpoise breaking surface as well. Lobsters and lobstering are a big part of Casco Bay, and the ocean surrounding Chebeague is dotted by thousands of lobster pot buoys, the livelihood of many year-round residents in the area. Lobstering is a big commodity of Casco Bay. Locals often fish from the docks and piers for mackerel, bluefish, or striped bass, just a few of many abundant fish in the area, and crab traps hang from the docks. Chebeague Island end of Bennetts Cove Rd.  Blueberries  All over the island, as Maine is often known for, are blueberry patches that supply an abundant amount of blueberries, ardently picked by the locals. However, they are slowly decreasing in size as land development continues.  Clamming and red tide  The many inlet coves around the island are home to abundant clam beds. During low tide, these fully exposed areas can be walked on and are often clammed by the locals, some of whom have made a living for decades harvesting steamers, hen clams, and razor clams from the muddy, clay-rich soil. Clamming is often shut down when the red tide -- a harmful microscopic ocean organism that affects shellfish -- \\"blooms\\" in the area. People who eat clams that are affected by the red tide (even steamed ones) can become violently ill; the algae can be fatal. This paralytic poisoning often causes death to humans, birds, larval and adult fish, and marine mammals. For many years, mussels -- which grow in clusters, attached by \\"beards\\" to rocks and seaweed, pier pilings, buoys, and just about any stable structure in the ocean -- were largely ignored as inedible. But during the 1980s and early 1990s, when clams were getting more difficult to acquire, mussels began to be considered good eating. Some consider these mollusks a bit more \\"gamey\\" in taste compared to clams but quite similar otherwise. Mussels can be reaped in much larger quantities, very quickly. Clams have to be dug out of the sand, by hand, with an angled pick; they very often withdraw deeper into their sand tunnel when they \\"hear\\" someone digging for them. This makes harvesting clams a backbreaking task. The clam shell may be broken during this procedure, ruining it. Mussels, on the other hand, are lying attached to rocks on the shore during low tide, and a bucketful can be collected in minutes. Marketing demands have reduced the mussel population greatly, and now they are often \\"grown\\" by farmers on floating barges where they can be easily \\"picked\\" when ready.  Ocean geography, tides, and weather  Typically Great Chebeague has tides under normal conditions. Ocean floor geography in the general area can vary drastically, thus careful navigation must be practiced when boating, even in small vessels. Many islands, including Great Chebeague, have extended rock outcroppings that are completely underwater during high tide, but may be lurking just below the surface as the tide drops, and may appear out of the water during low tide. The rip tide can be several knots, and rowing against it is physically impossible: Extra care must be taken when venturing out in small watercraft. Even on the clearest day, a thick fog can suddenly \\"roll in\\" out of nowhere, reducing visibility to zero. Even during the warmest summer months, the ocean temperature is barely above . Falling out of a boat into the water anytime between September and April can be dangerous, if not fatal, depending on the time of year. Swimming is enjoyed usually in inlets and coves where the water temperature is slightly higher, and off the pier or docks. Like most islands in the area, Chebeague has as much rocky cliffs for a shoreline as beaches. The \\"Niblic\\" beach by the boatyard and Deer Point by Chandler's Cove are popular beaches for their soft stretch of sand. On a clear day at Deer Point, one can see Mount Washington in New Hampshire. When the sun goes down, temperatures can drop drastically and, even on the warmest summer days, nights are often very cool and can require long sleeves and pants and even a fire in the fireplace. Winters can be brutal, and usually by September, most of the non-year-round residents are packed up and gone.  Services and stores  Chebeague Island has its own post office. There is cell phone service on the island. The Town of Chebeague Island has a webpage which provides access to town documents, a town calendar, and other information. The Town Administrator is Marjorie E. Stratton. There is one school on the island which has classes Pre-K through 5th grade. Students in sixth grade and older attend schools on the mainland. Sixth through eighth graders attend Frank H. Harrison Middle School in Yarmouth and ninth graders to seniors attend Yarmouth High School. The Chebeague Island Boatyard provides a variety of services ranging from indoor heated storage and nightly mooring rentals to portable marine engine diagnostics and fabricating or refinishing woodwork. In the summer months, a gift store, the Niblic, is open at the Boatyard. The Chebeague Island Methodist Church is the island‚Äôs oldest institution and the island‚Äôs only church. Its roots extend back into the 18th century when Methodist missionaries visited Casco Bay. The island matriarch was \\"excommunicated\\" from the Congregational Church when she joined the Methodists. They held class meetings and built a small meetinghouse. In 1814 nearly all of the 19 members were connected to the Hamiltons. As Chebeague‚Äôs population grew the need for a new church became apparent. In 1855 a schism about the location occurred. As a result, two Methodist churches were built within sight of each other. When the Methodist Protestant Church closed around 1890, they were welcomed back to the Methodist Episcopal. A new parsonage was built in 1885-86 and has housed many pastors and their families. Today, the church is led by Melissa Yosua-Davis. The local historical museum run by the [Chebeague Island Historical Society is open during the summer months. The Chebeague Island Library is open year-round. Second Wind Farm, run by Charles Varney, provides islanders with locally-grown produce during the season. The Chebeague Island Inn and restaurant is open in the summer, as is a nine-hole golf course, a tennis club, and two gifts shops, the Niblic, located at the Boatyard, and Island Riches, located near the landing for the Casco Bay Ferry. There is a full-time volunteer fire station and EMTs/ambulance. Police matters are handled by Cumberland County Sheriff officers. If there is a medical emergency, one must be taken to the mainland via the ambulance and ferry, which are always on call.

Combichrist was formed in Atlanta, Georgia and is now based in Englewood, Tennessee. The band consists of only LaPlegua in the studio, with a changing lineup of live performing members. Releases by the band have been very successful in terms of sales and charted in top positions for dance and alternative charts worldwide. History Formation and early years The first material that LaPlegua wrote for the project was a powernoise/techno crossover track Thanx to my Buddies under the moniker D.r.i.v.E for the Advanced Electronics Vol. 2 compilation. The song was later remade into Like to Thank My Buddies on Combichrist's album Everybody Hates You. The project's name was later changed to Hudlager and then finally to Combichrist before the debut album The Joy of Gunz was released on the German record label Out of Line. The band name came from a fanzine of LaPlegua's in the 1990s, with Combichrist being a character in it that was a \\"punk-rock messiah.\\" The character would go on drug and alcohol fueled rampages, later healing those whom he had beaten. A few years after the band's conception, LaPlegua departed Norway for the United States, which is now the current home-base for Combichrist and his other projects Scandy, Panzer AG, and Scandinavian Cock. The Joy of Gunz (2003‚Äì2005) Combichrist's first LP The Joy of Gunz was released in 2003. Sporting a fresh, original and aggressive new sound the brainchild of LaPlegua took the crowds by storm. On Halloween of the same year, the limited edition EP Kiss The Blade was released with 667 pressings which sold out in less than a week. In 2004, the second EP, Sex, Drogen Und Industrial, spent several weeks at number one in the DAC charts. At the same time that Sex, Drogen Und Industrial was released, a limited edition of 666 white-vinyl 12\\" pressings for Blut Royale were produced, and sold out quickly.  Everybody Hates You (2005‚Äì2006)  The year 2005 saw the release of Everybody Hates You and it was at this time that LaPlegua began labeling the music as \\"Techno Body Music\\" or TBM. The band released a song called \\"This is TBM\\" on the Out-of-Line compilation Techno Body Music volume 1. They played this song live during their 2005 shows, adding vocals to it. No vocal version of the instrumental track was ever released, and the lyrics were instead later reworked for the track \\"Electrohead.\\" After this release, LaPlegua stopped referring to their music as TBM. Shortly after the release of the album, Army On The Dance Floor producer Kourtney Klein was added as alternating keyboardist and drummer to the band. The full-length album featured two tracks that became club classics ‚ÄúThis Shit Will Fuck You Up‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis Is My Rifle‚Äùand it was also the project‚Äôs U.S. debut on Metropolis Records. Further benchmarks were set with the release of the 2006 EP \\"Get Your Body Beat\\" the title track of which landed Combichrist its first appearance on Billboard‚Äôs Top 10 Dance Singles chart. The music video for the single was included on the DVD release of the biopunk film The Gene Generation with the song also being used in the movie. The band embarked on a North American tour with KMFDM soon after the release of the single.  What the Fuck is Wrong With You People? (2007‚Äì2009)  On March 6, 2007, What the Fuck is Wrong With You People? was released to some critical praise and popularity. The album featured 2006‚Äôs break out single, ‚ÄúGet Your Body Beat,‚Äù it had an explosive barrage of corrosive beats, leering vocals, and acidic melodies. WTFIWWYP? was a high energy, adrenaline charged piece of sonic battery. Combichrist played on the Gothic Cruise in 2008, and released a limited CDr EP only available to ticket-holders. Limited to 200 copies, it contains 7 tracks, of which 6 are exclusive.https://www.discogs.com/Combichrist-Gothic-Cruise/release/4103597  Today We Are All Demons (2009‚Äì2010)  Pull Out Kings producer and songwriter Z. Marr joined the band as keyboardist in January 2008 to begin work on the album Today We Are All Demons. According to an exchange with a fan, Trevor Friedrich of Imperative Reaction and formerly of Eighteen Visions, he was asked to join the band as a drummer with Joe Letz (of Wednesday 13) in October 2008. He replaced keyboardist Kourtney Klein, who began full-time work with Nitzer Ebb. Combichrist released Today We Are All Demons on Jan 20, 2009. Combichrist immediately went on a highly successful North American tour with Black Light Burns (featuring Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit) and an extensive European tour with Rammstein. For part the European tour that year, Trevor was temporarily replaced by Mark Jackson of VNV Nation. Combichrist's song \\"Shut Up and Bleed\\" featuring W.A.S.T.E was put on the soundtrack for the horror movie The Collector. Their song \\"Today We Are All Demons\\" (Beneath the World Mix) was put on the soundtrack for the movie Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.  Making Monsters (2010‚Äì2014)  LaPlegua performing in 2010 Combichrist's latest album, Making Monsters, was released digitally on 31 August 2010 and on CD on 28 September 2010. Combichrist began a tour in support of the new album in late 2010, with Aesthetic Perfection and iVardensphere as the support bands. In 2011, after opening for Rammstein at Madison Square Garden in December 2010, both bands announced Combichrist would be supporting Rammstein on their North American tour and LaPlegua announced the \\"Monsters on Tour Part II\\" taking place around the scheduled Rammstein shows. The \\"Monsters on Tour Part II\\" had the same support as the 2010 tour but with the additions of Angel Spit and God Module performing with them on select dates. Combichrist's music was prominently featured in the hack-n-slash style video game DmC Devil May Cry. Their track \\"Never Surrender\\" was featured in a gameplay demo, and Throat Full of Glass is played during the opening sequence. LaPlegua was heavily involved in the game's soundtrack. A new song called Bottle of Pain was released in January 2012 for the Underworld: Awakening movie soundtrack.  We Love You (2014‚Äì2016)  In October 2013, LaPlegua announced on Facebook that there would be a new album on the way in 2014. On December 10, 2013, Combichrist announced the title of their 7th studio album, We Love You, with a March 2014 release date. The We Love You promo tour, included acts from William Control and New Years Day. Two singles were released from this album, \\"From My Cold Dead Hands\\" and \\"Maggots at the Party\\". The video for Maggots at the Party has been nominated by Berlin Music Video Awards for 2015 Most Trashy Video.  This Is Where Death Begins (2016)  This Is Where Death Begins is the eighth studio album. It was released on June 3, 2016. The album sees the band moving further away from their original electronic sound towards rock and metal.  Make Europe Great Again (M.E.G.A) Tour, and \\"This Is Where Death Begins\\" (2016)  In February 2016, it was announced that the new album (as yet untitled, but often hashtagged #ThisIsWhereITBegins on Instagram posts about it) will be released in May. LaPlegua and the band's official Instagram pages posted snippets, clips, and hinted at guest artists ‚Äì possibly some of Coal Chamber and Filter, and the female singer of MXMS. A full European tour is planned for June and July, with Nick Rossi (ex-New Years Day) joining the live line-up as a second drummer/percussionist. Meanwhile, the band's first show of the year ‚Äì the Out Of Line Festival in Berlin ‚Äì saw them perform without long-time keyboardist Z. Marr, who has left the band to pursue other interests (in June 2016 it was revealed he has joined .https://www.instagram.com/p/BGFbpWPAXGl/) He was replaced by Elliott Berlin, of Aesthetic Perfection and Telemark, who has previously played keys for an \\"Old-School\\" Combichrist show and toured extensively as their show tech. Nick Rossi will be playing live keys on the forthcoming tour, in addition to his drumming duties ‚Äì much as Shaun Frandsen did on the 2012 Evolution Tour. On 9 April, LaPlegua played a solo show at Complex, in Glendale, CA, which was a rare outing of the early instrumental incarnation of the band. The set list included tracks like Brain Bypass, Adult Content, Without Emotions, God Bless, Bulletfuck, Spit, God Wrapped In Plastic, The Kill (Instru-mental Version from \\"The Frost EP\\"), God Warrior, and other rarely or never played techno/noise tracks. Of the evening, LaPlegua said: \\"It was a rarity show, and I played the show exactly like I did back in the days when it was just me. No point playing obvious songs, when I can do those songs on any given show. I was happy to play all those songs I can never do with the full band, and I could have done a million more. Thanks to everyone coming out last night. I had a blast doing an old school set like this. For those who missed it; I will never do it again, so you missed out. To those who were there, thanks for sharing this night with me.\\" On 18 April, it was announced that the new album will be called \\"This Is Where Death Begins\\" with a release date of 3 June 2016. Available on double vinyl and CD, a two-CD version includes a live recording of the Complex, LA, show. A three-CD and DVD version includes audio and video from the Summer Breeze Festival in 2015, making this the band's first official live release. One Fire (2019)  Following the 2017 release of standalone track \\"Broken : United\\", a new album called \\"One Fire\\" is scheduled for a Spring release, delayed from Fall 2018, followed by a US tour in March/April and European shows (some festival, some headline) in June, July, August. Joe Letz announced his departure on 17 January, after 13 years as main drummer, ahead of official album/tour announcements and in line with his new sober lifestyle. LaPlegua posted a farewell statement, confirming that \\"Joe‚Äôs departure has nothing to do with the band itself. It is about recovery, a different life and spending more time with his family.\\" LaPlegua added that he/Combichrist has \\"new management, new booking agency, Nick Rossi and Eric 13 working hard with me, Elliot Berlin on keyboards and a new second drummer Will Spodnick.\\"https://www.facebook.com/YouKnowYoureACombichristFanWhen/posts/2330725590293539 Hellfest2019Combichrist 01.jpg Hellfest2019Combichrist 02.jpg Hellfest2019Combichrist 05.jpg Hellfest2019Combichrist 06.jpg Band members Combichrist was originally just LaPlegua onstage, followed by LaPlegua plus one other 2003‚Äì2006. The lineup then changed and expanded to include Shaun F, Jon Horton, and Joe Letz. Combichrist has existed and played as a solo act, a duo, a trio, a quartet, a quintet, and on occasion has played shows with six members. The Past Members include full and touring members of the band, while the Guest Members includes special appearances for one or two shows only.

Seal (sigillum) of Herman VI. A descendant of the Swabian House of Z√§hringen, he was the son of Margrave Herman V and Irmengard, daughter of Count Palatine Henry V of the Rhine. He succeeded his father in Baden on 16 January 1243. In 1248, he married Gertrude of Austria, the niece of the last male member of the Babenberg dynasty, Duke Frederick II of Austria (1230‚Äì1246), and on the basis of that marriage claimed the duchies of Austria and Styria, leaving the rule over Baden to his younger brother Rudolf. However, he had a mighty rival in King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who in 1252 married Frederick's sister Margaret to legitimize his claims. According to the Privilegium Minus issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1156, the Austrian lands could be bequeathed in the female line, and Herman even obtained the explicit consent by Pope Innocent IV. Nevertheless, the margrave and his son Frederick could not establish themselves in Austria and Styria against the resistance of the local nobility, who preferred Ottokar. Both rivals finally did not prevail, as the duchies were seized as reverted fiefs by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany after Ottokar's death at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278.

It is part of the city of Portland, Maine. As of the 2000 census, the island had a year-round population of 5. Most of the island is private property. It is served by the Casco Bay Lines ferry service. At low tide, Little Diamond Island connects to Great Diamond via a semi-submerged sandbar. At high tide, the sandbar makes for a fully covered beach. This is how the City of Portland is capable of picking up the trash on both islands. Little Diamond Island's water supply comes from the City of Portland, with the majority of the houses/cottages receiving their water through aboveground pipes. The aboveground pipes are turned off and emptied in the winter, leaving the south end of the island with no water. Casco Bay Lines stops first at Little Diamond Island on its regular run; the dock is located on the south end of the island. On the Fourth of July the island holds a huge community event which includes games, and a \\"Horribles Parade,\\" ending with candy and donuts. In the middle of the dock is a large building which the islanders call the casino. Every Saturday night during the summer season a select number, about 5, families cook for the rest of the island. Therefore, in the casino, there is a kitchen, and a small library is housed on the second floor. Downstairs, accessible from the outside, is a tiny store. The island children call it the candy store. It sells island merchandise and, of course, candy. It has no schedule as it is run by numerous residents of the island, and is only open in the summer months. As of February 2007, there were 55 homes/cottages on Little Diamond Island.

Where colour light signals are in use, a S.P.A.D. occurs when a train passes a red signal without authority, and where semaphore signals are used, a S.P.A.D. occurs when a train passes a signal in the 'on' position without authority. In the U.K, the alternative description signal passed at red (S.P.A.R.) is used where a signal changes to red in front of a train due to either a technical fault or in an emergency, such that the train is unable to stop before passing the signal, despite being driven correctly. Causes It takes a considerable distance to stop a train, and incidents of this type often involve a slight or very slight overrun of the signal, at low speed, because the driver has braked too late, often after sighting the signal too late. In some situations, however, the driver is unaware that they have passed a signal at danger and so continues until a collision occurs, as in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash. In such cases it is up to the safety system (where fitted) to apply the brakes, or for the signaller to alert the driver. Some of the causes are: *Misjudgement *Inattention *Distraction *Fatigue *Misreading of an adjacent signal due to line curvature, or sighting on one beyond *Misunderstanding *Miscommunication *Incomplete or lapsed route knowledge *Acute medical condition (medical emergency), such as a heart attack or stroke *Chronic medical condition, such as sleep apnea causing microsleep  Prevention   Automatic train protection  Automatic train protection (ATP) is a much more advanced form of train stop which can regulate the speed of trains in many more situations other than at a stop signal. ATP supervises speed restrictions and distance to danger points. An ATP will also take into account the individual train characteristics such as brake performance. Thus, the ATP determines when brakes should be applied in order to stop the train before getting to the danger point. In the UK, only a small percentage of trains (First Great Western and Chiltern Railways) are fitted with this equipment.  Driver's reminder appliance  The DRA is an inhibiting switch located on the driver's desk of United Kingdom passenger trains designed specifically to prevent 'starting away SPADs'. The driver is required to operate the DRA whenever the train is brought to a stand, either after passing a signal displaying caution or at a signal displaying danger. Once applied, the DRA displays a red light and prevents traction power from being taken. Collision prevention systems Whilst the ideal safety system would prevent a SPAD from occurring, most equipment in current use does not stop the train before it has passed the Danger signal. However, provided that the train stops within the designated overlap beyond that signal, a collision should not occur.  Train stops  On the London Underground (for example), mechanical train stops are fitted beside the track at signals to stop a train, should an S.P.A.D occur. Train stops are also installed on main line railways in places where tripcock equipped trains run in extensive tunnels, such as the on the Northern City Line where the Automatic warning system and Train Protection & Warning System are not fitted. Train Protection & Warning System On the UK mainline, TPWS consists of an on-board receiver/timer connected to the emergency braking system of a train, and radio frequency transmitter loops located on the track. The 'Overspeed Sensor System' pair of loops is located on the approach to the signal, and will activate the train's emergency brake if it approaches faster than the 'trigger speed' when the signal is at danger. The 'Train Stop System' pair of loops is located at the signal, and will activate the emergency brake if the train passes over them at any speed when the signal is at danger. TPWS has proved to be an effective system in the UK, and has prevented several significant collisions. However, its deployment is not universal; only those signals where the risk of collision is considered to be significant are fitted with it.  Flank protection  At certain junctions, especially where if the signal protecting the junction was passed at danger a side collision is likely to result, then flank protection may be used. Derailers and/or facing points beyond the signal protecting the junction will be set in such a position to allow a safe overlap if the signal was passed without authority. This effectively removes the chance of a side-impact collision as the train would be diverted in a parallel path to the approaching train.  SPAD indicators  SPAD indicator Prior to the introduction of TPWS in the UK, \\"SPAD indicators\\" were introduced at 'high risk' locations (for example: the entry to a single track section of line). Consisting of three red lamps, they are placed beyond the protecting stop signal and are normally unlit. If a driver passes the signal at 'danger', the top and bottom lamps flash red and the centre lamp is lit continuously. Whenever a SPAD indicator activates, all drivers who observe it are required to stop immediately, even if they can see that the signal pertaining to their own train is showing a proceed aspect. Since the introduction of TPWS, provision of new SPAD indicators has become less common. UK acronyms: SPAD / SPAR In the UK, incidents where a signal is passed at danger without authority are categorised according to principal cause. A SPAD is where the train proceeds beyond its authorised movement to an unauthorised movement. Other types are categorised as SPAR (\\"signal passed at red\\"). Prior to December 2012, the term \\"SPAD\\" applied to all such incidents, with a letter specifying cause. * A SPAD (formerly Category A SPAD) is where the train proceeds beyond its authorised movement to an unauthorised movement. * A Technical SPAR (formerly Category B SPAD) is where the signal reverted to danger in front of the train due to an equipment failure or signaller error and the train was unable to stop before passing the signal. * A Signaller SPAR (formerly Category C SPAD) is where the signal was replaced to danger in front of the train by the signaller in accordance with the rules and regulations and the train was unable to stop before passing the signal. * A Runaway SPAR (formerly Category D SPAD) is where an unattended train or vehicles not attached to a traction unit run away past a signal at danger. Note that where this was the fault of the driver, this will be classed as a SPAD. SPADs arising on starting from stations - typically those informally termed 'ding- ding right-aways', where the driver has inadvertently acted on a guard or dispatcher's indication without reading the signal - can be classified further: * SAS SPAD ‚Äì \\"Starting against signal\\" SPAD, where the train was standing at a danger signal and the driver moved past it. * SOY SPAD ‚Äì \\"Starting on yellow\\" SPAD, where the train left on a caution signal and the driver did not appreciate that the next signal might be at danger.  Passing signals at danger ‚Äì with authority  Signals form part of a complex system, and it is inevitable that faults may occur. They are designed to fail safe, so that when problems occur, the affected signal indicates danger (an example where this did not happen was the Clapham Junction rail crash due primarily to faulty wiring). To keep the network running, safety rules enable trains to pass signals that cannot be cleared to a proceed aspect. Provided that authority for the movement is obtained, a SPAD does not occur. There are two methods of obtaining that authority: Driver obtains signaller's authority to pass a signal at danger Once the train has been brought to a stand at a signal which is at danger, the driver should attempt to contact the signaller. If the signal cannot be cleared then the driver must obtain the signaller's authority to pass it at danger. Methods for contacting the signaller may include GSM-R cab radio, signal post telephone or mobile phone. The signaller can authorise a driver to pass a signal at danger when: * The signal is defective or disconnected * The signal cannot be cleared because signalling or level crossing equipment has failed * The signal is to be passed at danger for shunting purposes * The signal cannot be cleared because a train or movement which has reversed is then required to start from beyond that signal * An electric train is to pass the signal protecting an isolated section and proceed towards the limiting point * A train has been accepted using restricted acceptance because the line is clear only up to the home signal of the next signal box and the section signal cannot be cleared * In an emergency, and then only when authorised by the signal box supervisor or Operations Control, so that a train carrying passengers can enter an occupied section to use a station platform * An engineering train is to move towards a possession, or leave a line under possession at an intermediate point * A train is to pass the signal protecting engineering work to gain access to a station where the train is required to start back, or a line under single line working, or a siding * The line is to be examined to check that it is clear * A train is to proceed at caution through an absolute block section from the signal box in rear when a failed train has been removed * A train is to enter the section after a train or vehicle that has proceeded without authority has been removed, or the front portion of a divided train has passed through the section * A train is to enter the section to assist a failed train, evacuate passengers from a failed train, remove a portion of a divided train, or remove a train or vehicles that have proceeded without authority * Single line working applies * Working by pilotman or modified working applies The driver and signaller must come to a clear understanding, and ensure they agree about how it is to be done. In the UK the signaller tells the driver of a specific train to pass a specific signal at danger, proceed with caution and travel at a speed that enables him to stop short of any obstruction, and then obey all other signals. If the signal is fitted with TPWS, the driver resets the Driver Reminder Appliance, pushes the TPWS Trainstop Override button in the cab, and proceeds cautiously through the section. If the train reaches the next signal without finding an obstruction, they must obey its aspect, at which point they can revert to normal working. Driver passes a signal at danger under his own authority If contact with the signaller cannot be made then the driver must not move the train, unless it is standing at one of the following signals: * An Intermediate Block Home signal * A signal controlled from a signal box that is closed * An automatic signal where local instructions permit it, e.g. signals within tunnels on the Northern City Line. After passing a signal at danger under his own authority, the driver must stop at the next signal (even if it is showing a proceed aspect) and inform the signaller of what he has done.

She was the niece of Duke Frederick II of Austria, the last male member of the Babenberg dynasty. She was, according to the Privilegium Minus the first in line to inherit the Duchies of Austria and Styria after the death of childless Frederick, but these claims were disputed by her aunt Margaret. Early years Gertrude was the only child of Henry of Austria, Duke of M√∂dling, by his wife Agnes, daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia. Henry, in turn, was the second son of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. In 1216, after the death of his older brother Leopold, Henry became his father's heir. Henry died on 26 September 1228, only twenty years old and without male issue. Two years later, on 28 July 1230, Henry's father Duke Leopold VI also died and was succeeded by Frederick II, Leopold's third son. Because Babenberg Austria was inheritable by females according to the provisions of Privilegium Minus, Gertrude disputed Frederick's ascension, claiming Austria as her inheritance as the only child of Leopold VI's eldest son. Even so, Gertrude's claim was eventually bypassed in her uncle's favor. Despite this negative turn of events, Gertrude inherited her father's Duchy of M√∂dling and was placed under the guardianship of her uncle, Frederick II, who, after two unhappy marriages, remained childless. This made Gertrude the primogenitural heiress of the entire Babenberg line of Dukes of Austria and Styria. Marriage Complicating Frederick II's hold over Austria was his long-standing quarrel with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, during which he was placed under an imperial ban. In 1245, in a spectacular change of imperial politics, Frederick II of Austria became one of the emperor's most important allies when negotiations regarding the elevation of Vienna to a bishopric and of Austria (including Styria) to a Kingdom were initiated. One condition effecting a positive outcome was that the 19-year-old Duke's niece, Gertrude, would marry the 51-year-old Emperor who was a widower three times over. Though desirous of the union, Wenceslaus I of Bohemia nevertheless voiced his concerns given a preexisting agreement that Gertrude marry his eldest son and heir Vladislaus. Gertrude herself refused the marriage with the aged Emperor, citing his recent excommunication by the Pope. Other sources claim that she was in love with Vladislaus. After sending an army to Austria in order to pressure Duke Frederick II into agreeing to the union of Gertrude and Vladislaus, the two parties came to terms early in June 1245 in Verona. The rapid rise of Duke Frederick's political ambitions proved short-lived. On 15 June 1246 Frederick II was killed in battle. King Wenceslaus quickly arranged the formal marriage ceremony of Gertrude and his heir, Vladislaus. Per hoc Wladislaus habebat Austriae ducatum cheered Bohemia and, supported by the rights of his wife and the prospect of inheriting the Bohemian throne, Vladislaus was quickly recognized as Duke by the Austrian aristocracy. However, shortly after their marriage, Vladislaus died on 3 January 1247. In 1248, in order to bolster her claims, the 22-year-old Duchess married Herman VI, Margrave of Baden. The following year Gertrude gave birth to a son Frederick. In celebration of the happy event, Gertrude gave 30 people in Alland, the place of her son's birth, extended farm lands which became the foundation of the agrarian community of the Allander Urhausbesitzer. In 1250 Gertrude had a second child, a daughter, whom she named Agnes after her maternal grandmother. Frustrated ambitions Herman was able to maintain only minimal control in the duchies, failing ultimately to defeat the opposition of the Austrian aristocracy. As a result, Gertrude and her children fled to Meissen in Saxony and her relationship with Herman deteriorated significantly. Gertrude was suspected of poisoning Herman when he died on 4 October 1250. Gertrude lost the favour of the curia and with it the chance to recover the Babenberg dominions of Austria and Styria when she refused to marry the brother of Count William II of Holland, Floris, who was also the favored candidate of Pope Innocent IV. In the meantime, her aunt and competitor for the duchies of Austria and Styria, Margaret, married Ottokar of Bohemia, the second son and next heir of Wenceslaus I. The aristocracy accepted Margaret and Ottokar as the rulers of Austria. On 12 July 1252, having lost most of her support, Gertrude formed an alliance with B√©la IV of Hungary and married his relative, Roman Danylovich, Prince of Halicz, a member of the Rurikid dynasty. In 1253, Gertrude gave birth to her only child from this union, Maria. However, after failing to establish himself as Duke of Austria, Roman left Gertrude and their daughter to return to Hungary. Shortly thereafter, the marriage was formally dissolved. Eventually, in 1254, Gertrude received a portion of Styria, 400 silver marks annually, and the towns of Voitsberg and Judenburg as her residences. In 1267, as neither Gertrude nor her son Frederick forswore their claim to the duchies of Styria and Austria, King Ottokar II dispossessed them of their lands. Ottokar was largely motivated since he sought to remarry into the Hungarian royal house; he could not expect an heir with the significantly older and barren Margaret. That same year, the death of Margaret made Gertrude the only legitimate heir to the Babenberg dynasty. Decline On 8 September 1268, Gertrude's son Frederick, who had accompanied Conradin on his Italian expedition, was captured in Astura to the south of Anzio. Handed over to Charles of Anjou, he remained in degrading imprisonment in the Castel dell'Ovo in Naples until his public beheading in the Piazza del Mercato in Naples on 29 October. The following year, Gertrude was exiled and lost her claim to Windisch-Feistritz. Again, she found refuge with her family in Meissen. Gertrude's other claims were ultimately lost when Rudolf I of Germany granted her duchies to his own sons in 1282. Six years later, Gertrude died as an Abbess of the Poor Clare convent of Saint Afra near Seusslitz in Meissen. Her daughter Agnes of Baden became mother and brother's heir, but in 1279, renounced her rights to Baden and the Duchies of Austria and Styria. From her second marriage with Count Ulrich III of Heunburg, Agnes had five children, two sons (Frederick and Herman) and three daughters (Margaret, Elisabeth and Katharina). The sons died without heirs. The eldest daughter, Katharina, married the Styrian nobleman Ulrich of Sanneck, and their son Frederick I of Cilli eventually inherited his grandfather's estates. He founded the House of Cilli, which included Holy Roman Empress Barbara of Cilli whose daughter, Elizabeth of Luxembourg, married into the House of Habsburg. Gertrude's youngest daughter, Maria Romanovna of Halicz, born from her third marriage, married Joachim Gutkeled, son of Ban Stephen Gutkeled, the former Hungarian National Captain (German: Landeshauptmanns) in Styria. The date of her death or if she left any descendants is unknown.

It is called the Gwenn-ha-du, pronounced , which means white and black in Breton. It is also unofficially used in the department of Loire-Atlantique although this now belongs to the Pays de la Loire and not to the region of Brittany, as the territory of Loire-Atlantique is historically part of the province of Brittany. Nantes (Naoned), its prefecture, was once one of the two capital cities of Brittany. The flag was created in 1923 by Morvan Marchal. Overview The dimensions of the flag are not fixed and may vary from to . The flag is used not only by cultural associations or separatists but by other people. For years the authorities considered the flag as a separatist symbol, but the attitude has now changed and the flag, no longer having any political connotations, may appear everywhere, even on public buildings, along with the other official flags. It is widely used throughout Brittany and can even be seen on town halls in the region. Because of the absence of legislation concerning regional flags in France the flag is also flown on sailing boats and fishing boats. The design of the ermine spots varies but the version most frequently seen is shown above. The flag was created in 1923 by Morvan Marchal. He used as his inspiration the flag of the United States, seen as a symbol of freedom. The nine horizontal stripes represent the traditional dioceses of Brittany into which the duchy was divided historically. The five black stripes represent the French or Gallo speaking dioceses of Dol, Nantes, Rennes, Saint-Malo and Saint-Brieuc; the four white stripes represent the Breton-speaking dioceses of Tr√©gor, L√©on, Cornouaille and Vannes. The ermine canton recalls the arms of the Duchy of Brittany. The flag first came to the notice of a wider public at the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris in 1925. It was adopted by various cultural and nationalist groups through the 1920s and 1930s. However its association with nationalist and separatist groups during the Second World War brought suspicions of collaboration to the flag. A revival of interest in the flag took place in the 1960s. Since then it has mostly lost an association with separatism in the mind of the public and become a widely accepted symbol for all Brittany and Bretons. The older ermine field flag and black cross continue to be used, though rarely, by some individuals and groups. In blazons the flag is Sable, four bars Argent; the canton ermine. Traditionally coats of arms could be displayed as a rectangular banner as well as on a shield.

It is the oldest Anglican theological college in the Americas. It was affiliated to the University of Durham from 1875. History  Founding and Developments in the 1700s Codrington College was founded with the profits from the bequest of Christopher Codrington, who after his death in 1710 left portions of his sugar cane estates ‚Äì the Codrington Plantations as well as land on Barbados and Barbuda to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to establish a religious college in Barbados. As the sugar cane estates were still operating, the Society and the College benefited directly from the forced labour of African slaves. Compared to his bequest to the Society, Codrington provided ¬£10,000 (the equivalent of approximately ¬£1.2 million in modern terms) and roughly 12,000 books to his alma mater, All Souls College, Oxford University. In his will, Codrington wrote, reflecting the spelling of the time period: \\"Paragraph 8, Item: I give the bequeath my two plantations in Barbados to the Society for Propagation of the Christian Religion in Foreign parts, Erected and established by my late good master, King William the Third, and my desire is to have the plantations continued Intire and three hundred negroes at least Kept thereon, and A convenient number of Professors and Scholars maintained there, all of them to be under the vows of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience, who shall be obliged to Studdy and Practice Physick and Chyrurgery as well as Divinity, that by the apparent usefulness of the former to all mankind, they may both ender themselves to the people and have better opportunitys of doeing good to mens souls wilst they are taking care of their Bodys. But the Particulars of the Constitution I leave to the Society Comps'd of good and wise men.\\" This bequest is unusual in that it was intended to benefit the non- white population of Barbados, rather than most colonial colleges which benefited the slave-owning class. However, Wilder suggests that Codrington directed that a portion of his charitable bequest be used to educate the enslaved population of Barbados immediately or directly, but this was a gesture effectively blocked by the objections of fellow planters. Moreover, the Society, having taken over the Codrington Plantations continued to use slave labour and even branded the word \\"Society\\" on the chests of slaves. Slavery only ended when the Slavery Abolition Act was enacted in 1833. At that time, in accordance with the Slave Compensation Act 1837, the Society received funding (a little over ¬£8,823 for 411 slaves) as compensation for the loss of the slave labour, as was the case for all slave owners. Construction was started in 1714, and the college was eventually opened on 9 September 1745 with twelve or 16 male students. Some of the delay in completing the structure is attributed to disputes regarding the properties and related debts (and perhaps political opposition as noted by Wilder above). Later, on 10 October 1780, a hurricane severely damaged the building. That, plus a downturn in the economic climate led to the school being closed between 1780 and 1797. The Reverend Mark Nicholson was appointed the head of Codrington in 1797 and stayed on until 1821, providing stability for the college and preparing it for the next stage of its development. History would repeat itself in 1831 when the site was almost completely destroyed by a hurricane but was rebuilt and yet again in 1926 when this time fire gutted the college. Codrington College The college initially provided a general education at the grammar school level. Its curriculum was similar to that found in English public schools of that time. This was necessary as there were no schools in Barbados at the time, therefore there was a need to develop first a group of students with basic educational skills and knowledge who could benefit from a college level education. Thomas Moody, a member of a prominent British family of British imperialists, served as mathematics master, writing master, and Assistant Headmaster of Codrington College from 1797 to 1805.  Developments in the 1800s  Beginning around 1824 and influenced by the first Bishop of the new See of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, Bishop William Hart Coleridge, Codrington made substantial steps towards teaching at the college level. While some advanced studies had been offered as early as 1748, these were usually taken up by sons of the local gentry (who had tutors at home) before they went to an English university. The first graduate had been ordained in 1759. The grammar school was moved to the Chaplain's lodge so that the college could focus on higher studies and became known as The Lodge School. On 9 September 1830, Codrington College achieved university status, focussing exclusively on training students for ordination. This marked it as one of the first theological colleges of the Anglican Church; only St. David's College Lampeter, the General Theological Seminary and Virginia Theological Seminary pre-date it, while Chichester Theological College, the first such college in England, was only opened in 1839. In 1875, Codrington entered a new stage by entering into an affiliation with Durham University in England. Thus, graduates of Codrington received a Durham degree in classics or theology. Codrington was the first overseas institution to have the right to grant a degree from a British university. This affiliation in the classics lasted until 1958 by which 283 Codrington graduates had obtained Durham degrees. The terms of the affiliation read (in part): 1\\\\. Students of Codrington College, Barbados and Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone, may have their names placed on the Register of the University as Matriculated Students of the same, provided that the Principal of their College, or other person authorized to act in his behalf, shall have certified to the Warden that they have passed an examination similar to that required for the admission of student, in the several faculties, in the University of Durham. 2\\\\. Students of the affiliated Colleges, having been so matriculated shall be admissible to the Exercises and Public Examinations required for proceeding to Degrees, Licenses, and Academical ranks in the several Faculties, provided that they have forwarded to the Warden certificates of having fulfilled the same conditions as to residence, attendance at lectures, and conformity to discipline, in their own Colleges, as are required from other Students of the University so admissible, terms of residence being counted from the time of passing the Admission Examination of their own College.  Developments in the 1900s  Around 1912, Codrington, under the direction of Principal Anstey, commenced delivering teacher training. The teacher training institution was called the Rawle Training Institute, named after a previous college principal. It initially enrolled men only, accepting women a year or two later. The Rawle provided teacher training not just to Barbadians but to individuals from other parts of the West Indies. Rawle was the forerunner of the Erdiston Teachers' Training College, established in 1948, signalling the end of Codrington's involvement in teacher training and the closure of the Rawle Institute. The late 1940s and early 1950s saw several factors lead to a discussion of the affiliation between Codrington College and Durham University. One was the establishment of the University College of the West Indies, the predecessor to the University of the West Indies. The university was founded in 1948, on the recommendation of the Asquith Commissionhttp://www.bcn.cl/obtienearchivo?id=documentos/10221.1/29331/2/213787.pdf through its sub-committee on the West Indies chaired by Sir James Irvine.Report of the West Indies Committee of the Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty June 1945. London, His Majesty's Stationery Office The Asquith Commission had been established in 1943 to review the provision of higher education in the British colonies. Initially in a special relationship with the University of London, the then University College of the West Indies (UCWI) was seated at Mona, about five miles from Kingston, Jamaica. The university was based at the Gibraltar Camp used by evacuated Gibraltarians during the war. The fact that the new institution was established in Jamaica and the final report of the commission made no mention of Codrington raised questions of its relevance. Moreover, Durham was concerned about the quality of the education offered at Codrington. One of the reasons for this was the minimal communication between the two institutions. Letters to Codrington were routinely left unanswered. In fact, the Society was still involved in managing and funding Codrington College. When the Society announced, in the press, that the College would be run by the brothers of the Community of the Resurrection, officials at Durham had not been informed and took finding out about the arrangement in the press disconcerting. Eventually, it was decided to alter the affiliation agreement so that only degrees in theology would be granted by Durham, which then mirrored the focus of studies at Codrington. The establishment of the University College of the West Indies meant that non-religious studies in the Caribbean would be focused on the new institution. Codrington, therefore, focussed its studies on theology. It was assumed that Codrington would seek affiliation with the new University College. Since 1965, Codrington has been affiliated to the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill. The Licentiate in Theology was first introduced that year, followed by the BA in Theology in 1971, in affiliation with Cave Hill. Codrington began to offer a Diploma in Theology on a part-time basis in 1978. This course was designed for lay people who taught religion in day schools and who played important roles in churches. It began to offer post-graduate courses in 1989. The college currently maintains several archives relating to the churches of the West Indies. The microfilm collection includes records of the Society, The Church Missionary Society, the Baptist Missionary Society, and the Presbyterian Church of Trinidad and Grenada. In 1976, changes were made to the governance of both Codrington College and the Codrington Estates. Two boards were established, one for the estates and another for the college. In this way, day-to-day running of both came under the Anglican Church of the West Indies. Later, the Codrington Trust Act moved legal control from the Society (now called the United Society Partners in the Gospel) to a completely West Indian group. This was the outcome of the government having taken over the funding of the grammar school, referred to as the Lodge School, in 1879 and leasing the premises for 100 years. On its expiry, the government decided, with the support of the USPG, that it was time for the Codrington Trust to be fully in the control of local people.  Campus  Codrington College In 1713, Colonel Christian Lilly designed the original Codrington College campus, aspiring for it to replicate the design of a University of Oxford college, with four long sides of a building enclosing a quadrangle. However, due to financial constraints, only the southern portion of the plan was built, with the construction period lasting from 1714 to 1743. The main building is constructed of coral stone. The design includes a central portico with a pediment and three high arches. The portico sits between a chapel and a hall with a bust of Christopher Codrington. The chapel has an altar configured with a vaulted ceiling and panelled with ebony, lignum vitae, and cordia wood. The campus also includes the Principal's Lodge. Originally, the Consett plantation great house, it was a large building but simply designed in three chambers. The impressive porch is carved coral stone and original, carved Jacobean balustrades have survived through a building fire. The building is now used as a library and for study space. The campus is entered via road lined with august trees of varying species, including giant silk cotton, whitewood or white cedars, mahogany and others. An ornamental lake is fed by a natural spring.  Academics  The College now offers a small number of undergraduate and graduate diplomas and degrees, both for those planning to join the Anglican Church as priests and for lay members.  Undergraduate Studies  Diploma in Theological Studies. This two-year program is designed for lay people who are leaders in their church. The part-time programme includes six modules taken over two years. The courses are available in either a traditional face-to-face format or in an online format with asynchronous content and synchronous online sessions with the facilitator. Courses include systematic theology, the Old Testament, the New Testament, history of Christianity, Christian ethics and comparative religion. The subsequent certificate is awarded by Codrington. Licentiate in Theology. The licentiate degree (L.Th) is designed to prepare individuals to become Anglican priests. Entrance requirements range from a high school diploma through to a previous university degree. A wide range of courses is offered in this programme. The degree is awarded by the University of the West Indies. Bachelor of Arts (Theology). The BA (Theology) degree is also designed to prepare individuals to become Anglican ministers. Students may opt for a three-year program or a four-year programme and the entry requirements are the same as entry to the Faculty of Humanities and Education of the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, being basically high school graduation or community college/associate degree credentials. A wide range of courses is offered in this programme. The degree is awarded by the University of the West Indies. Minors in Theology. It is also possible to take a minor in theology in one of three foci: Biblical Studies, Historical & Pastoral Studies, or Systematic & Religious. The degree is awarded by the University of the West Indies. Diploma in Pastoral Studies. The Student Handbook mentions a Diploma in Pastoral Studies. It appears that the diploma provides the professional training not included in the BA Theology or Licentiate in Theology, though the handbook states that \\"candidates may offer some of the above [diploma] courses for the L.Th. or B.A. Theology\\". Courses in this diploma include homiletics, pastoral studies, spirituality, and stewardship.  Graduate Studies  Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in theology are also available. The main areas of study at this level are biblical studies, church history and theology, pastoral and liturgical studies, and systematic theology and philosophy. Entry into these programmes would require, inter alia, a bachelor's degree for the Master's programmes, and a Master's degree for the doctoral programme, or equivalent preparation, usually in theology. These degrees are awarded by the UWI.  Administration  As noted in the history section above, responsibility for the Codrington Estate passed from the Society to local hands. This is in the form of the Codrington Trust. The Trust, therefore, is responsible for the continued development of the bequest. There are seven members of the Trust governing body, five appointed by the Church and two appointed by the Minister (the Codrington Trust Act does not specify which Minister but a current trustee is from the Ministry of Social Care, Constituency Empowerment & Community Development).

Bordering the Moncloa-Aravaca district of Madrid proper to its west, Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n is surrounded by large Mediterranean pine-tree forests: the Casa de Campo, the Monte del Pardo, and the Monte del Pilar. , it ranks as the wealthiest municipality in Spain. La Finca, an isolated luxury residential area known by its affluent residents, most notably football players, lies within the municipality bounds. History Pozuelo has become a low-density residential area during recent decades, as new residential developments have spread over formerly agricultural lands. New transportation infrastructure is approved by the local government. Notable infrastructure developments include the M-40 (the second, counting outwards, of Madrid's ring motorways) and the new 'Metro Ligero' (light rail) line ML2 of the Madrid metro system, which was built in summer 2007 to connect Pozuelo with the Aluche district in the city of Madrid. Two stations also serve Pozuelo: 'Pozuelo' and 'El Barrial-Centro Commercial Pozuelo' of the Madrid area local train system, the 'Cercanias'. Road access is also provided by the A6 and the M503, with the Madrid orbital M40 running to the west. Pozuelo has one of the highest average per capita incomes in Madrid. According to a report by the Institute of Statistics of the Comunidad de Madrid, Pozuelo's average income level ranks highest, by a notable margin, amongst the municipalities of the Region of Madrid. The standard of living in most of its neighborhoods is high, although some old town-center areas, where a growing economic immigrant population has moved in, are excluded from such wealth. Pozuelo has a number of urban parks, some of them elongated and serving to separate different areas of the town. The Avenida de Europa is an urban development designed around a wide boulevard. A distinct religious building in the municipality is the Catholic , a post- conciliar brick building by Fernando Higueras. A right-wing stronghold, the ayuntamiento (the local government institution) has been ruled by political conservatives since the first democratic elections of the modern Spanish democracy took place.

Biography Han was born in Hunan, China. While relying on traditional Chinese culture, in particular Chinese mythology, folklore, Taoism and Buddhism as source of inspiration, he also borrows freely from Western literary techniques. As a teenager during the Cultural revolution he was labeled an ‚Äòeducated youth‚Äô and sent to the countryside for re-education through labour. Employed at a local cultural center after 1977, he soon won recognition as an outspoken new literary talent. His early stories attacked the ultra-leftist degradation of China during the Mao era; they tended toward a slightly modernist style. However, he reemerged in the mid-1980s as the leader of an avant-garde school, the \\"Search for Roots\\" or the Xungen Movement. Work Han's major work to date is A Dictionary of Maqiao, a novel published in 1996 and translated into English in 2003. His writing is influenced by Kafka and by the magic realism of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. In 1987, he published a Chinese translation of Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being and edited Hainan Jishi Wenxue (\\"Hainan Documentary Literature\\"), a successful literary magazine.

The psychedelic drug (or entheogen) lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was first synthesized on November 16, 1938 by the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz (now Novartis) laboratories in Basel, Switzerland.Albert Hofmann; translated from the original German (LSD Ganz Pers√∂nlich) by J. Ott. MAPS-Volume 6, Number 69, Summer 1969 It was not until five years later on April 19, 1943, that the psychedelic properties were found.  Discovery  Albert Hofmann, born in Switzerland, joined the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories, located in Basel, as a co-worker with professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director of the pharmaceutical department. He began studying the medicinal plant squill and the fungus ergot as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals. His main contribution was to elucidate the chemical structure of the common nucleus of Scilla glycosides (an active principle of Mediterranean Squill). While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on November 16, 1938. The main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant (an analeptic). It was set aside for five years, until April 16, 1943, when Hofmann decided to take a second look at it. While re-synthesizing LSD, he accidentally absorbed a small amount of the drug and discovered its powerful effects. He described what he felt as being: > ... affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. > At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like > condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a > dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly > glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, > extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After about > two hours this condition faded away.Hofmann 1980, p. 15  \\"Bicycle Day\\"  On April 19, 1943, Hofmann performed a self-experiment to determine the true effects of LSD, intentionally ingesting 0.25 milligrams (250 micrograms) of the substance, an amount he predicted to be a threshold dose (an actual threshold dose is 0.02 milligrams). Less than an hour later, Hofmann experienced sudden and intense changes in perception. He asked his laboratory assistant to escort him home. As was customary in Basel, they made the journey by bicycle. On the way, Hofmann's condition rapidly deteriorated as he struggled with feelings of anxiety, alternating in his beliefs that the next-door neighbor was a malevolent witch, that he was going insane, and that the LSD had poisoned him. When the house doctor arrived, however, he could detect no physical abnormalities, save for a pair of incredibly dilated pupils. Hofmann was reassured, and soon his terror began to give way to a sense of good fortune and enjoyment, as he later wrote... > \\"... Little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and > plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, > fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then > closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains, > rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux ...\\" The events of the first LSD trip, now known as ‚ÄúBicycle Day‚Äù, after the bicycle ride home, proved to Hofmann that he had indeed made a significant discovery: a psychoactive substance with extraordinary potency, capable of causing significant shifts of consciousness in incredibly low doses. Hofmann foresaw the drug as a powerful psychiatric tool; because of its intense and introspective nature, he couldn't imagine anyone using it recreationally. Bicycle Day is increasingly observed in psychedelic communities as a day to celebrate the discovery of LSD. The celebration of Bicycle Day originated in DeKalb, Illinois, in 1985, when Thomas B. Roberts, then a Professor at Northern Illinois University, invented the name \\"Bicycle Day\\" when he founded the first celebration at his home. Several years later, he sent an announcement made by one of his students to friends and Internet lists, thus propagating the idea and the celebration. His original intent was to commemorate Hofmann's original, accidental exposure on April 16, but that date fell midweek and was not a good time for the party, so he chose the 19th to honor Hofmann's first intentional exposure.  Psychiatric use  LSD was introduced as a commercial medication under the trade-name Delysid for various psychiatric uses in 1947.Arthur Stoll and Albert Hofmann LSD Patent April 30, 1943 in Switzerland and March 23, 1948 in the United States. LSD was brought to the attention of the United States in 1949 by Sandoz Laboratories because they believed LSD might have clinical applications.Novak J., Steven:\\"LSD before Leary: Sidney Cohen's Critique of 1950s Psychedelic Drug Research\\", Isis, Vol. 88, No. 1 pp. 87-110 Throughout the 1950s, mainstream media reported on research into LSD and its growing use in psychiatry, and undergraduate psychology students taking LSD as part of their education described the effects of the drug. Time magazine published six positive reports on LSD between 1954 and 1959. LSD was originally perceived as a psychotomimetic capable of producing model psychosis.Langlitz, N. BioSocieties (2006) 1: 159. https://doi.org/10.1017/S174585520605023X By the mid-1950s, LSD research was being conducted in major American medical centers, where researchers used LSD as a means of temporarily replicating the effects of mental illness. One of the leading authorities on LSD during the 1950s in the United States was the psychoanalyst Sidney Cohen. Cohen first took the drug on October 12, 1955 and expected to have an unpleasant trip, but was surprised when he experienced ‚Äúno confused, disoriented delirium.‚Äù He reported that the ‚Äúproblems and strivings, the worries and frustrations of everyday life vanished; in their place was a majestic, sunlit, heavenly inner quietude.‚Äù Cohen immediately began his own experiments with LSD with the help of Aldous Huxley whom he had met in 1955. In 1957, with the help of psychologist Betty Eisner, Cohen began experimenting on whether or not LSD might have a helpful effect in facilitating psychotherapy, curing alcoholism, and enhancing creativity. Between 1957 and 1958, they treated 22 patients who suffered from minor personality disorders. LSD was also given to artists in order to track their mental deterioration, but Huxley believed LSD might enhance their creativity. Between 1958 and 1962, psychiatrist Oscar Janiger tested LSD on more than 100 painters, writers, and composers. In one study in the late 1950s, Dr. Humphry Osmond gave LSD to alcoholics in Alcoholics Anonymous who had failed to quit drinking.Dyck, Erika. 'Psychedelic Psychiatry: LSD From Clinic to Campus. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008. After one year, around 50% of the study group had not had a drink -- a success rate that has never been duplicated by any other means.Maclean, J.R.; Macdonald, D.C.; Ogden, F.; Wilby, E., \\"LSD-25 and mescaline as therapeutic adjuvants.\\" In: Abramson, H., Ed., The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism, Bobbs- Merrill: New York, 1967, pp. 407‚Äì426; Ditman, K.S.; Bailey, J.J., \\"Evaluating LSD as a psychotherapeutic agent,\\" pp.74‚Äì80; Hoffer, A., \\"A program for the treatment of alcoholism: LSD, malvaria, and nicotinic acid,\\" pp. 353‚Äì402. In the United Kingdom the use of LSD was pioneered by Dr. Ronald A. Sandison in 1952, at Powick Hospital, Worcestershire. A special LSD unit was set up in 1958. After Sandison left the hospital in 1964, medical superintendent Arthur Spencer took over and continued the clinical use of the drug until it was withdrawn in 1965. In all, 683 patients were treated with LSD in 13,785 separate sessions at Powick, but Spencer was the last member of the medical staff to use it. From the late 1940s through the mid-1970s, extensive research and testing was conducted on LSD. During a 15-year period beginning in 1950, research on LSD and other hallucinogens generated over 1,000 scientific papers, several dozen books, and six international conferences. Overall, LSD was prescribed as treatment to over 40,000 patients. Film star Cary Grant was one of many men during the 1950s and 1960s who were given LSD in concert with psychotherapy. Many psychiatrists began taking the drug recreationally and sharing it with friends. Dr. Leary's experiments (see Timothy Leary below) spread LSD usage to a much wider segment of the general populace. Sandoz halted LSD production in August 1965 after growing governmental protests at its proliferation among the general populace. The National Institute of Mental Health in the United States distributed LSD on a limited basis for scientific research. Scientific study of LSD largely ceased by about 1980 as research funding declined, and governments became wary of permitting such research, fearing that the results of the research might encourage illicit LSD use. By the end of the 20th century, there were few authorized researchers left, and their efforts were mostly directed towards establishing approved protocols for further work with LSD in easing the suffering of the dying and with drug addicts and alcoholics. A 2014 study showed evidence that LSD can have therapeutic benefits in treating anxiety associated with life-threatening diseases. Rick Doblin, an American drug researcher, described the work as ‚Äúa proof of concept‚Äù that he hoped would ‚Äúbreak these substances out of the mold of the counterculture and bring them back to the lab as part of a psychedelic renaissance.‚Äù (behind paywall) > Eight subjects received a full 200-microgram dose of LSD while four others > received one-tenth as much.

By the mid-1960s the backlash against the use of LSD and its perceived corrosive effects on the values of the Western middle class resulted in governmental action to restrict the availability of the drug by making any use of it illegal. LSD was declared a \\"Schedule I\\" substance, legally designating that the drug has a \\"high potential for abuse\\" and is without any \\"currently accepted medical use in treatment.\\" LSD was removed from legal circulation. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration claimed: > Although the initial observations on the benefits of LSD were highly > optimistic, empirical data developed subsequently proved less promising ... > Its use in scientific research has been extensive and its use has been > widespread. Although the study of LSD and other hallucinogens increased the > awareness of how chemicals could affect the mind, its use in psychotherapy > largely has been debunked. It produces no aphrodisiac effects, does not > increase creativity, has no lasting positive effect in treating alcoholics > or criminals, does not produce a 'model psychosis', and does not generate > immediate personality change. However, drug studies have confirmed that the > powerful hallucinogenic effects of this drug can produce profound adverse > reactions, such as acute panic reactions, psychotic crises, and > \\"flashbacks\\", especially in users ill-equipped to deal with such trauma. The governors of Nevada and California both signed bills into law on May 30, 1966, to control LSD, making them the first two states to outlaw the manufacture, sale, and possession of the drug. The law went into effect immediately in Nevada, and on October 6, 1966, in California. Other U.S. states and the rest of the world followed with the ban.  Influential individuals   Aldous Huxley  Renowned British intellectual Aldous Huxley was one of the most important figures in the early history of LSD. He was a figure of high repute in the world of letters and had become internationally famous through his novels Crome Yellow, Antic Hay and his dystopian novel Brave New World. His experiments with psychedelic drugs (initially mescaline) and his descriptions of them in his writings did much to spread awareness of psychedelic drugs to the general public and arguably helped to glamorize their recreational use, although Huxley himself treated them very seriously. Huxley was introduced to psychedelic drugs in 1953 by a friend, psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Osmond had become interested in hallucinogens and their relationship to mental illness in the 1940s. During the 1950s, he completed extensive studies of a number of drugs, including mescaline and LSD. As noted above, Osmond had some remarkable success in treating alcoholics with LSD. In May 1953 Osmond gave Huxley his first dose of mescaline at the Huxley home. In 1954 Huxley recorded his experiences in the landmark book The Doors of Perception; the title was drawn from a quotation by British artist and poet William Blake. Huxley tried LSD for the first time in 1955, obtained from \\"Captain\\" Al Hubbard.  Alfred Hubbard  Alfred Matthew Hubbard is reputed to have introduced more than 6,000 people to LSD, including scientists, politicians, intelligence officials, diplomats, and church figures. He became known as the original \\"Captain Trips\\", travelling about with a leather case containing pharmaceutically pure LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin. He became a 'freelance' apostle for LSD in the early 1950s after supposedly receiving an angelic vision telling him that something important to the future of mankind would soon be coming. When he read about LSD the next year, he immediately sought and acquired LSD, which he tried for himself in 1951. Although he had no medical training, Hubbard collaborated on running psychedelic sessions with LSD with Ross McLean at Vancouver's Hollywood Hospital, with psychiatrists Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond; with Myron Stolaroff at the International Federation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, California; and with Willis Harman at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). At various times over the next 20 years, Hubbard also reportedly worked for the Canadian Special Services, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms. It is also rumored that he was involved with the CIA's MK-ULTRA project. How his government positions actually interacted with his work with LSD is unknown.  Harold A. Abramson  In 1955, Time magazine reported: \\"In Manhattan, Psychiatrist Harold A. Abramson of the Cold Spring Harbor Biological Laboratory has developed a technique of serving dinner to a group of subjects, topping off the meal with a liqueur glass containing 40 micrograms of LSD.\\" This mention in America's most popular newsweekly is noteworthy because Abramson was not a psychiatrist or even a psychologist, but was an allergist who was a key participant in the CIA MK- ULTRA mind-control program.  R. Gordon Wasson  In 1957, R. Gordon Wasson, the vice president of J.P. Morgan, published an article in Life magazine extolling the virtues of magic mushrooms. This prompted Albert Hofmann to isolate psilocybin in 1958 for distribution by Sandoz with its product LSD in the U.S., further raising interest in LSD in the mass media. Following Wasson's report, Timothy Leary visited Mexico to experience the mushrooms.  Timothy Leary  DEA agents Howard Safir (left) and Don Strange (right) with Leary in custody (1972). Dr. Timothy Leary, a lecturer in psychology at Harvard University, was the most prominent pro-LSD researcher. Leary claimed that using LSD with the right dosage, set (ones emotional mindset at time of ingestion), and setting, preferably with the guidance of professionals, could alter behavior in dramatic and beneficial ways. Leary began conducting experiments with psilocybin in 1960 on himself and a number of Harvard graduate students after trying hallucinogenic mushrooms used in Native American religious rituals while visiting Mexico. His group began conducting experiments on state prisoners, where they claimed a 90% success rate preventing repeat offenses. Later reexamination of Leary's data reveals his results to be skewed, whether intentionally or not; the percent of men in the study who ended up back in prison later in life was approximately 2% lower than the usual rate. Leary was later introduced to LSD, and he then incorporated that drug into his research as his mental catalyst of choice. Leary claimed that his experiments produced no murders, suicides, psychotic breaks, or bad trips. Almost all of Leary's participants reported profound mystical experiences which they felt had a tremendously positive effect on their lives. While it is true that Leary's experiments did not lead to any murders, he willfully chose to ignore the bad trips which occurred, as well as the attempted suicide of a woman the day after she was given mescaline by Leary. By 1962, the Harvard faculty's disapproval with Leary's experiments reached critical mass. Leary was informed that the CIA was monitoring his research (see Government experiments below). Many of the other faculty members had harbored reservations about Leary's research, and parents began complaining to the university about Leary's distribution of hallucinogenic drugs to their children. Further, many undergraduate students who were not part of Leary's research program heard of the profound experiences other students had undergone and began taking LSD for recreational purposes, which was not illegal at the time . Leary described LSD as a potent aphrodisiac in an interview with Playboy magazine. Leary left the University for an extended amount of time during the spring semester, thus failing to fulfill his duties as professor. Leary and another Harvard psychologist, Richard Alpert, were dismissed from the University in 1963. In 1964, they published The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, which argued that the psychedelic experience paralleled the death/rebirth experience described in the Bardo Thodol (Tibetan Book of the Dead). Leary and Alpert, unfazed by their dismissals, relocated first to Mexico, but were expelled from the country by the Mexican government. They then set up at a large private mansion owned by William Hitchcock, named after the small town in New York State where it is located, Millbrook, where they continued their experiments. Their research lost its controlled scientific character as the experiments transformed into LSD parties. Leary later wrote, \\"We saw ourselves as anthropologists from the twenty-first century inhabiting a time module set somewhere in the Dark Ages of the 1960s. On this space colony, we were attempting to create a new paganism and a new dedication to life as art.\\" A judge who expressed dislike for Leary's books sentenced him to 30 years in prison for possession of half a marijuana cigarette in violation of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. However, this decision was reversed in the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case Timothy Leary v. United States (395 U.S. 6) on the grounds that the Act required self-incrimination, thus violating the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Publicity surrounding the case further cemented Leary's growing reputation as a counter cultural guru. Around this time, President Richard Nixon described Leary as \\"the most dangerous man in America.\\" Repeated FBI raids instigated the end of the Millbrook experiment. Leary refocused his efforts towards countering the tremendous amount of anti- LSD propaganda then being issued by the United States government, popularizing the slogan \\"Turn on, tune in, drop out.\\" Many experts blame Leary and his activism for the near-total suppression of psychedelic research over the next 35 years.  Owsley Stanley  Historically, LSD was distributed not for profit, but because those who made and distributed it truly believed that the psychedelic experience could be beneficial for humanity. A limited number of chemists, probably fewer than a dozen, are believed to have manufactured nearly all of the illicit LSD available in the United States. The best known of these is undoubtedly Augustus Owsley Stanley III, usually known simply as Owsley or Bear. The former chemistry student set up a private LSD lab in the mid-60s in San Francisco and supplied the LSD consumed at the famous Acid Test parties held by Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, as well as the Human Be-In in San Francisco in January 1967 and the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. He also had close social connections the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and The Holding Company, regularly supplying them with LSD and working as their live sound engineer, creating many tapes of these groups in concert. Owsley's LSD activities ‚Äî immortalized by Steely Dan in their song \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" ‚Äî ended with his arrest at the end of 1967, but some other manufacturers most likely operated continuously for 30 years or more. Announcing Owsley's first bust in 1966, The San Francisco Chronicle's headline \\"LSD Millionaire Arrested\\" inspired the rare Grateful Dead song \\"Alice D. Millionaire.\\" Owsley associated with other early LSD producers, Tim Scully and Nicholas Sand.  Ken Kesey  Ken Kesey was born in 1935 in La Junta, Colorado to dairy farmers Frederick A. Kesey and Ginevra Smith.Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher. \\"Ken Kesey, Author of 'Cuckoo's Nest,' Who Defined the Psychedelic Era, Dies at 66\\". The New York Times (November 11, 2001). Retrieved on February 21, 2008. In 1946, the family moved to Springfield, Oregon. A champion wrestler in both high school and college, he graduated from Springfield High School in 1953. Kesey attended the University of Oregon's School of Journalism, where he received a degree in speech and communication in 1957, where he was also a brother of Beta Theta Pi. He was awarded a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship in 1958 to enroll in the creative writing program at Stanford University, which he did the following year. While at Stanford, he studied under Wallace Stegner and began the manuscript that would become One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. At Stanford in 1959, Kesey volunteered to take part in a CIA-financed study named Project MKULTRA at the Menlo Park Veterans Hospital. The project studied the effects on the patients of psychoactive drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, AMT, and DMT. Kesey wrote many detailed accounts of his experiences with these drugs, both during the Project MKULTRA study and in the years of private experimentation that followed. Kesey's role as a medical guinea pig inspired him to write the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1962. The success of the book, as well as the sale of his residence at Stanford, allowed him to move to La Honda, California in the mountains west of Stanford University. He frequently entertained friends and many others with parties he called \\"Acid Tests\\" involving music (such as Kesey's favorite band, The Warlocks, later known as the Grateful Dead), black lights, fluorescent paint, strobes and other \\"psychedelic\\" effects, and, of course, LSD. These parties were noted in some of Allen Ginsberg's poems and are also described in the books The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe, Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs by Hunter S. Thompson, and Freewheelin Frank, Secretary of the Hell's Angels by Frank Reynolds. Ken Kesey was also said to have experimented with LSD with Ringo Starr in 1965 and that he influenced the setup for future performances with The Beatles in the UK. In the summer of 1964, Kesey's Merry Pranksters customized a bus named \\"Furthur\\" and set out on a tour to propagate LSD use.  Sidney Cohen  Sidney Cohen was a Los Angeles-based psychiatrist. His work primarily focused on the effects of psychedelics, primarily LSD. Cohen published 13 books in his life, all of them being based around drugs and substance abuse. He began working on LSD in the 1950s. One of his earlier works is a video of an experiment that shows Cohen interviewing a woman before and after administering her LSD. In the later part of the 1960s he worked as a director for the National Institute of Mental Health in their Division of Narcotic Addiction and Drug Abuse. He has been open about having taken LSD many times himself, but was always opposed to the growing use of LSD amongst members of the counterculture movement. Cohen thought LSD was only safe if used under medical supervision and that the average person was not equipped with the ability to safely handle the drug. Through his work he had become known as one of the leading experts in LSD research.  William Leonard Pickard  William Leonard Pickard earned a scholarship to Princeton University but dropped out after one term, instead preferring to hang out at Greenwich Village jazz clubs in New York City. In 1971, he got a job as a research manager at the University of California, Berkeley in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, a job he held until 1974. In December 1988, a neighbor reported a strange chemical odor coming from an architectural shop at a Mountain View, California industrial park. Federal agents arrived to find 200,000 doses of LSD and William Pickard inside. Pickard was charged with manufacturing LSD and served five years in prison. By 1994, Pickard had enrolled at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. His studies focused on drug abuse in the former Soviet Union, where he theorized that the booming black market and many unemployed chemists could lead to a flood of the drug market. In 2000, Pickard was arrested for manufacturing LSD in Kansas and was serving two life sentences at United States Penitentiary, Tucson. On July 27, 2020, Pickard was granted Compassionate Release from federal prison after serving 17 years of his sentence.  Secret government research  The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became interested in LSD when they read reports alleging that American prisoners during the Korean War were being brainwashed with the use of some sort of drug or ‚Äúlie serum.‚Äù LSD was the original centerpiece of the top secret MKULTRA project, an ambitious undertaking conducted from the 1950s through the 70s designed to explore the possibilities of pharmaceutical mind control. Hundreds of participants, including CIA agents, government employees, military personnel, prostitutes, members of the general public, and mental patients were given LSD, many without their knowledge or consent. The experiments often involved severe psychological torture. To guard against outward reactions, doctors conducted experiments in clinics and laboratories where subjects were monitored by EEG machines and had their words recorded. Some studies investigated whether drugs, stress or specific environmental conditions could be used to break prisoners or to induce confessions. The CIA also created The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, which was a CIA funding front which provided grants to social scientists and medical researchers investigating questions of interest related to the MKULTRA program. Between 1960 and 1963, the CIA gave $856,782 worth of grants to different organizations. The researchers eventually concluded that LSD's effects were too varied and uncontrollable to make it of any practical use as a truth drug, and the project moved on to other substances. It would be decades before the U.S. government admitted the existence of the project and offered apologies to the families of those who were forced to participate in the experiments. During this time period, the use of LSD for psychochemical warfare was under consideration and testing, among other substances. Looking to replicate the effects of nerve gas created by the Germans during World War II without the toxicity, LSD was sought for use under the pretense that it could induce hysteria and psychoses, or at least an inability to fight without wholesale destruction of the enemy and their properties. Thousands of tests on willing research subjects took place at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, with the ultimate conclusion being that LSD was too unpredictable and uncontrollable for any tactical use.  Recreational use   From 1960 to 1980  Estimated annual numbers of first-time LSD use in the United States among persons aged 12 or older: 1967‚Äì2008. LSD began to be used recreationally in certain (primarily medical) circles. Mainly academics and medical professionals, who became acquainted with LSD in their work, began using it themselves and sharing it with friends and associates. Among the first to do so was British psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Psychedelic subculture goes mainstream LSD historian Jay Stevens, author of the 1987 book Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream, has said that in the early days of its recreational use, LSD users (who were at that time mostly academics and medical professionals) fell into two broadly delineated groups. The first group, which was essentially conservative and exemplified by Aldous Huxley, felt that LSD was too powerful and too dangerous to allow its immediate and widespread introduction, and that its use ought to be restricted to the 'elite' members of society -- artists, writers, scientists -- who could mediate its gradual distribution throughout society. The second and more radical group, typified by Richard Alpert and Timothy Leary, felt that LSD had the power to revolutionize society and that it should be spread as widely as possible and be available to all. During the 1960s, this second 'group' of casual LSD users evolved and expanded into a subculture that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug's powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising consciousness. The personalities associated with the subculture included spiritual gurus such as Dr. Timothy Leary and psychedelic rock musicians such as the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane and the Beatles, and soon attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD. The popularization of LSD outside of the medical world was hastened when individuals such as author Ken Kesey participated in drug trials and liked what they saw. Tom Wolfe wrote a widely read account of the early days of LSD's entrance into the non-academic world in his book The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, which documented the cross-country, acid-fueled voyage of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters on the psychedelic bus \\"Furthur\\" and the Pranksters' later 'Acid Test' LSD parties. In 1965, Sandoz laboratories stopped its still legal shipments of LSD to the United States for research and psychiatric use, after a request from the U.S. government concerned about its use. By April 1966, LSD use had become so widespread that Time magazine warned about its dangers. In December 1966, the exploitation film \\"Hallucination Generation\\" was released. This was followed by the films \\"The Trip\\" in 1967 and \\"Psych- Out\\" in 1968. Musicians and LSD  On March 27, 1965, Beatles members John Lennon and George Harrison (and their wives) were dosed with LSD without their permission by their dentist, Dr. John Riley. John Lennon mentioned the incident in his famous 1970 Rolling Stone interview, but the name of the dentist was revealed only in 2006. On August 24, 1965, Lennon, Harrison and Ringo Starr took their second trip on LSD. Actor Peter Fonda repeatedly said \\"I know what it's like to be dead\\" to John Lennon during an LSD trip. John Lennon wrote \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" a fanciful song which many assumed referred to LSD, although he always denied the connection as coincidence. The songs \\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" from the Beatles' Revolver album explicitly reference LSD trips, and many lines of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" were borrowed from Timothy Leary's book The Psychedelic Experience. Around the same time, bands such as Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, and The Grateful Dead helped give birth to a genre known as \\"psychedelic rock\\" or acid rock. In 1965, The Pretty Things released an album called Get the Picture? which included a track titled \\"L.S.D.\\" LSD became a headline item in early 1967, and the Beatles admitted to having been under the influence of LSD. Earlier in the year, British tabloid News of the World ran a sensational three-week series on 'drug parties' hosted by rock group The Moody Blues and attended by leading stars including Donovan, The Who's Pete Townshend and Cream drummer Ginger Baker. Largely as a result of collusion between News of the World journalists and the London Drug Squad, many pop stars including Donovan and Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were arrested for drug possession, although none of the arrests involved LSD. The FBI suggested in now declassified documents that the Grateful Dead were responsible for introducing LSD to the U.S. The Grateful Dead were the \\"house band\\" at Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters' Acid Tests. These free-form parties introduced many people on the West Coast to LSD for the first time, as documented in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and Phil Lesh's Searching for the Sound. Acid historian Jesse Jarnow describes how Grateful Dead concerts served as the United States' primary distribution network for LSD in the second half of the twentieth century. In 1992, Mike Dirnt of Green Day wrote the famous \\"Longview\\" bass line while under the influence of LSD. In an interview, Green Day lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong recalled that he arrived at their house and saw Mike sitting on the floor with highly dilated pupils, holding his bass guitar. Mike looked up at Billie and exclaimed, \\"Listen to this!\\"  LSD in Australia  LSD was evidently in limited recreational use in Australia in the early 1960s, but is believed to have been initially restricted to those with connections to the scientific and the medical communities. LSD overdose was suggested as a possible cause of the January 2, 1962 deaths of CSIRO scientists Dr. Gilbert Bogle and his lover Dr. Margaret Chandler, but is very unlikely as there are no known cases of a LSD fatal overdose and other more likely causes of death have been suggested. Large quantities of LSD began to appear in Australia around 1968, and soon permeated the music scene and youth culture in general, especially in the capital cities. The major source of supply during this period is believed to have been American servicemen visiting Australia (mainly Sydney) from Vietnam on 'rest and recreation' (R&R;) leave, although the growing connections between American and Australian organized crime in the late 1960s may also have facilitated its importation. Recreational LSD use among young people was on a par with that in other countries in Australia by the early 1970s and continued until late in the decade. LSD is not believed to have been manufactured locally in a significant quantity (if at all) and most if not all supplies were sourced from overseas.  Production of LSD  During the 1960s and early 1970s, the drug culture adopted LSD as the psychedelic drug of choice, particularly amongst the hippie community. However, LSD dramatically decreased in popularity in the mid-1970s. This decline was due to negative publicity centred on side-effects of LSD use, its criminalization, and the increasing effectiveness of drug law enforcement efforts, rather than new medical information. The last country to produce LSD legally (until 1975) was Czechoslovakia; during the 1960s, high-quality LSD was imported from the communist country to California, a fact appreciated by Leary in The Politics of Ecstasy. Victor James Kapur had the first known home grown UK 'acid lab'. Up to then, all LSD had been imported from the U.S. or was remnant produce of Sandoz before it stopped producing LSD. In 1967, Kapur was caught distributing 19 grams of crystalline LSD and subsequently the police raided both of his laboratories. One was in the back room of Kapur's chemist shop and another, larger one, was in a garage he rented from a friend of his brother-in-law.https://www.scribd.com/doc/221850813/Andy-Roberts- Albion-Dreaming-A-Popular-History-of-LSD-in-Britain A second group was busted in 1969. A lab in Kent, and a flat in London were raided simultaneously and quantities of equipment and LSD seized along with the two men who had been making the LSD, Quentin Theobald and Peter Simmons. The availability of LSD had been drastically reduced by the late 1970s due to a combination of governmental controls and law enforcement. The supply of constituent chemicals including lysergic acid, which was used for production of LSD in the 1960s, and ergotamine tartrate, which was used for production in the 1970s, were placed under tight surveillance and government funding for LSD research was almost completely eliminated. These efforts were augmented by a series of major busts in England and Europe. One of the most famous was \\"Operation Julie\\" in Britain in 1978, named after the first name of the female drug squad officer involved; it broke up one of the largest LSD manufacturing and distribution operations in the world at that time, headed by chemist Richard Kemp. The group targeted by the Julie task force were reputed to have had links to the mysterious The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and to Ronald Stark.  Modern times  LSD made a comeback in the 1980s accompanying the advent of recreational MDMA use, first in the punk and gothic subcultures through dance clubs, then in the 1990s through the acid house scene and rave subculture. LSD use and availability declined sharply following a raid of a large scale LSD lab in 2000 (see LSD in the United States). The lab was run by William Leonard Pickard (who served 17 years of a two lifetime sentence in US federal prison in Tucson, AZ) and Clyde Apperson (now serving 30 years in prison). Gordon Todd Skinner, who owned the property the large scale lab had been operating on, came to the DEA looking to work as an informant. He and his then-girlfriend Krystle Cole were intimately involved in the case, but were not charged in the bust. The lab was allegedly producing a kilogram of LSD every five weeks, and the U.S. government contends that LSD supply dropped by 90% following the bust. In the decade after the bust, LSD availability and use has gradually risen. Since the late 1980s, there has also been a revival of hallucinogen research more broadly, which, in recent years, has included preclinical and clinical studies involving LSD and other compounds such as members of the 2C family compounds and psilocybin.Langlitz, Nicolas.

In particular, a study released in 2012 highlighted the extraordinary effectiveness of LSD in treating alcoholism. In November 2015, Rolling Stone magazine reported on an increasing number of young professionals, particularly in the San Francisco area, who were using \\"microdosing\\" (around 10 micrograms) of LSD in an effort to \\"work through technical problems and become more innovative.\\"  See also  * Urban legends about LSD * LSD art * Psychedelic therapy Notes  References   Further reading   Stephenson, Scott (2014) \\"LSD and the American Counterculture\\" Burgmann Journal vol 3 pp. 41‚Äì46 (PDF) Category:Lysergic acid diethylamide LSD Category:History of pharmacy da:LSD#Dansk historie de:LSD#Geschichte ","title":"History of lysergic acid diethylamide"},{"id":"1119229","text":"Franciscus Irenicus, byname of Franz Friedlieb (1494/1495 ‚Äì 1553) was a German humanist, Protestant reformer and historian.

He is sometimes described in the United States as \\"the father of life insurance\\", or \\"the father of insurance regulation\\", as he campaigned that life insurance companies must keep reserves and provide surrender values. Wright served as an insurance commissioner for the State of Massachusetts.*  Early life  Wright was born in South Canaan, Connecticut, to a devout Christian family, who held anti-slavery beliefs and instilled in him a strict moral character. He was the first son of Elizur Wright (1762-1845), whose father was also named Elizur Wright, and his second wife Clarissa Richards (1771‚Äì1843). Wright was one of 10 children; six were half-siblings by his father's first wife. His father was a 1781 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale College, and was known for his mathematical learning and devotion to the Calvinist faith. In 1810 the family moved to Tallmadge, Ohio, and the younger Elizur worked on the farm and attended an Academy that was conducted by his father. The famous abolitionist John Brown attended the Academy in Tallmadge with Elizur. His home served often as a refuge for fugitive slaves. In 1826, the younger Wright graduated from Yale and began to teach: first for two years in Groton, Massachusetts, where he met and married Susan Clark, then at Hudson, Ohio, as a mathematics and natural philosophy (science) professor at Western Reserve College and Preparatory School (1829-1833), the first college in northern Ohio. It was during this time that Wright encountered the writings of William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison's small book, Thoughts on African Colonization, persuaded Wright that slavery should immediately be abolished, and that the American Colonization Society's effort to transport free blacks to an African colony was both unethical and impractical. Garrison's pamphlet and his new newspaper, The Liberator, had other influence on Western Reserve College. In 1832, College pastor and professor of sacred literature (Bible) Beriah Green preached four abolitionist sermons clearly inspired by Garrison. The uproar this created, which was followed nationally, led to Green's resignation. Under pressure from conservative trustees, he left to become president of the Oneida Institute, where as a condition of his acceptance of the post, he was free to preach \\"immediatism\\", immediate abolition. The Oneida Institute focused on preparing future abolitionists, which Green felt was a moral and religious obligation. The school's most distinguished professor, President Charles Backus Storrs, professor of theology, \\"bemoaned the fact that 'nothing is done in [the] college but discuss abolition and colonization'\\". He contracted tuberculosis, took a leave of absence, and died within six months. This left Wright as one of two remaining professors, and it was an environment scarcely more hospitable for him than it had been for Green. The other professor, Rufus Nutting, professor of ancient languages and head of the library, was a colonizationist and cared little for abolitionism. Like Green, Wright wanted to accomplish more for the abolitionist cause than he could in Hudson.  Abolitionist  Along with the brothers Lewis and Arthur Tappan, Beriah Green, Theodore Weld, James Birney, and other like-minded individuals, Wright founded the American Anti-Slavery Society at a convention in Philadelphia in December 1833, the year Wright had moved to New York City. Wright became the national secretary of the organization for five years. At this time, the American Anti- Slavery Society espoused the immediate abolition of slavery, and called for an end to racial prejudice and equality for all. To effect this change, members practiced a policy of \\"moral suasion,\\" an appeal to people's ethics in an attempt to get them to embrace abolitionism and renounce slavery as sinful. Wright edited a large number of publications, including Human Rights (1834-1835), The Emancipator and the Quarterly Anti-Slavery Magazine (1835-1838). His continued opposition to slavery incurred the enmity of its advocates, his house was once besieged by a mob, and an attempt was made to kidnap him and convey him to North Carolina. In 1838, he moved to Boston, where he became editor of the Massachusetts Abolitionist in April 1839. In 1846 he established the Chronotype newspaper, which he conducted until it was absorbed by the Commonwealth (1850), of which also he was for a time the editor. He was also involved in \\"The Great Postal Campaign\\"a project whose job was to distribute abolitionist material across the country. The Anti-Slavery Society was successful in recruiting agents throughout the country to spread their message, but when Garrison and others began to broaden the scope of the Society to include women's rights and took on an anti-religion, anti- government tone, Wright and others objected and began to split from the Society in 1840. Wright became involved with the newly created Liberty Party and began to separate from the evangelists and the religious anti-slavery movements, believing that government intervention was the way to abolition. Wright was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves. He was arrested and charged for aiding in the 1851 escape of Shadrach Minkins, the first black man to be seized in New England under the Fugitive Slave Act. He was not convicted. Wright was also indicted and tried for libel in consequence of his severe words for the liquor interests while publishing the Chronotype. Wright eventually became estranged from the abolitionist movement. Moreover, due partially to disappointment in his church's lack of support for the abolitionist cause, and to a slowly growing desire to find secular solutions to social problems, the formerly pious and devout Congregationalist distanced himself from the church. Eventually, Wright became an atheist.In Abolitionist, Actuary, Atheist: Elizur Wright and the Reform Impulse, Wright's biographer Lawrence B. Goodheart describes him as \\"an evangelical atheist, an impassioned actuary, a liberal who advocated state regulation, an individualist who championed social cooperation, and a very private public crusader\\" (op. cit., page x)  Inventions  The Arithmeter, a high resolution cylindrical slide rule invented by Wright and patented in 1869. He sold it to insurance companies for $500.00, though only about 20 were made. Between 1853 and 1858, besides editing the Railroad Times, he gave his attention to invention and mechanics, constructing a spike-making machine, a water faucet, and an improvement in pipe coupling. He patented the last two, and manufactured them for a short time.  Life insurance  According to Frank Preston Stearns, Wright became interested in life insurance as a mathematical study and read \\"the best works on life insurance ... with the same ardor with which young ladies devour an exciting novel.\\" In the spring of 1852 an insurance broker placed an advertising booklet in his hand wherein Elizur Wright looked it over and perceived quickly enough that no company could undertake to do what this one pretended to and remain solvent. At age 40, Wright visited the Royal Exchange in London to investigate the life insurance industry. It was on this trip where he saw an advertisement in the Daily Telegraph for the Sale of 42 Old Life Insurance Policies in which old men were auctioning off their life insurance policies to investors after faithfully paying premiums all their lives. Elizur recognized that these life insurance policy owners were too old to work and could no longer afford their premium payments but were not yet dead to collect the benefit. As a result, the policy owners looked to speculators or investors. Wright recognized and wrote about the fact that life insurance policy owners were not able to obtain as much as half of the value that should be in these policies, but do obtain such from investors in his book Politics and Mysteries of Life Insurance.Politics and Mysteries of Life Insurance, Elizur Wright, 1873 To Wright, this was unconscionable, and upon his return to America, he began campaigning for a cleanup of the life insurance business, by requiring insurers to pay ‚Äúsurrender values‚Äù to policyholders on request and to hold adequate reserves to do so. Wright realized how easy it was to for insurance carriers to cheat, so he devised formulas for calculating the reserves and created statutory capital requirements for the industry. Ultimately, the life insurance industry accepted Wright's reforms. Wright served as an insurance commissioner for the State of Massachusetts from 1858 to 1866.http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~gsimon/Wright01.pdf He devised a new formula for finding the values of policies of various terms, known as the ‚Äúaccumulation formula,‚Äù and, in order to facilitate his work, invented and afterward patented (1869) the ‚Äúarithmeter,‚Äù a mechanical contrivance for multiplication and division, based on the logarithmic principle, a form of cylindrical slide rule.  Public parks  Wright, a member of the Forestry Association, was instrumental in obtaining the Massachusetts Forestry Act of 1882. He initiated and promoted plans for making Middlesex Fells, an area north of Boston bordering Malden and Melrose, into a public park; although he did not succeed during his lifetime, the plan was carried out later and Middlesex Fells is Middlesex Fells Reservation to this day. Other activities Wright served as an officer of the National Liberal League.Equal rights in religion: Report of the Centennial Congress of Liberals, and organization of the National Liberal League, at Philadelphia, on the fourth of July, 1876. Boston: National Liberal League, 1876. Along with his rationalist approach to insurance and religion, Wright was an ardent advocate of a phonetic writing system he called \\"phonotypy.\\" A column written in this system appeared in almost every issue of his newspaper, the Chronotype (1846-1850).An almost complete run of the Weekly Chronotype is in the collection of the Maine Historical Society.

The first siege, by the crusaders against the Muslim-held city, lasted from 21 October 1097 to 2 June 1098. Antioch lay in a strategic location on the crusaders' route to Palestine. Supplies, reinforcements and retreat could all be controlled by the city. Anticipating that it would be attacked, the Muslim governor of the city, Yaghi-Siyan, began stockpiling food and sending requests for help. The Byzantine walls surrounding the city presented a formidable obstacle to its capture, but the leaders of the crusade felt compelled to besiege Antioch anyway. The crusaders arrived outside the city on 21 October and began the siege. The garrison sortied unsuccessfully on 29 December. After stripping the surrounding area of food, the crusaders were forced to look farther afield for supplies, opening themselves to ambush. On 31 December, a force of 20,000 crusaders encountered a relief army led by Duqaq of Damascus heading to Antioch and defeated them. As the siege went on, supplies dwindled and in early 1098 one in seven of the crusaders was dying from starvation, and people began deserting. A second relief force, this time under the command of Ridwan of Aleppo, advanced towards Antioch, arriving on 9 February. Like the army of Duqaq before, it was defeated. Antioch was captured on 3 June, although the citadel remained in the hands of the Muslim defenders. Kerbogha of Mosul began the second siege, against the crusaders who had occupied Antioch, which lasted from 7 to 28 June 1098. The second siege ended when the crusaders exited the city to engage Kerbogha's army in battle and succeeded in defeating them. On seeing the Muslim army routed, the defenders remaining in the citadel surrendered. Background There are a number of contemporaneous sources relating to the Siege of Antioch and the First Crusade. There are four narrative accounts: those of Fulcher of Chartres, Peter Tudebode, and Raymond of Aguilers, and the anonymous Gesta Francorum. Nine letters survive relating to or from the crusading army; five of them were written while the siege was underway and another in September, not long after the city had been taken. While there are many sources the number of people on crusade is unclear because they fluctuated regularly and many non-combatants on pilgrimage accompanied the soldiers. Historian Jonathan Riley-Smith offers a rough guide, suggesting that perhaps 43,000 people (including soldiers, armed poor, and non-combatants) were involved in the Siege of Nicaea in June 1097, while as few as 15,000 may have taken part in the Siege of Jerusalem in July 1099. Lying on the slopes of the Orontes Valley, in 1097 Antioch covered more than and was encircled by walls studded by 400 towers. The river ran along the city's northern wall before entering Antioch from the northwest and exiting east through the northern half of the city. Mount Silpius, crested by a citadel, was the Antioch's highest point and rose some above the valley floor. There were six gates through which the city could be entered: three along the northern wall, and one on each of the south, east, and west sides. The valley slopes made approaching from the south, east, or west difficult, so the most practical access route for a large number of people was from the north across flatter ground. The city's defences dated from the reign of the Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century. Though Antioch changed hands twice between then and the arrival of the crusaders in 1097, each time it was the result of betrayal rather than inadequacy of the defences. After the Byzantine Empire reconquered Antioch in 969 a programme of fortification building was undertaken in the surrounding area to secure the gains. As part of this, a citadel was built on Mount Silpius in Antioch. High enough to be separate from the city below, historian Hugh Kennedy opined that it \\"[relied] on inaccessibility as its main defence\\". At its fall to Seljuk Turks in 1085, Antioch was the last Byzantine fortification in Syria. Yaghi-Siyan was made Governor of Antioch in 1087 and held the position when the crusaders arrived in 1097. Yaghi-Siyan was aware of the approaching crusader army as it marched through Anatolia in 1097; the city stood between the crusaders and Palestine. Though under Muslim control, the majority of Antioch's inhabitants were Christians. Yaghi-Siyan had previously been tolerant of the Christian populace, however that changed as the crusaders approached. To prepare for their arrival he imprisoned the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, John the Oxite, turned St Paul's Cathedral into a stable and expelled many leading Christians from the city. Yaghi-Siyan then sent out appeals for help: his request was turned down by Ridwan of Aleppo because of personal animosity, however Yaghi-Siyan was more successful in his approaches to other nobles in the region and Duqaq of Damascus, Toghtekin, Kerbogha, the sultans of Baghdad and Persia, and the emir of Homs all agreed to send reinforcements. Meanwhile, back in Antioch Yaghi-Siyan began stockpiling supplies in anticipation of a siege. Knowing they had to capture Antioch, the crusaders considered how best to go about the task. Attrition suffered during the army's long journey across Anatolia meant the leaders considered leaving an assault until reinforcements arrived in spring. Tatikios, the Byzantine advisor to the crusade, suggested adopting tactics similar to those used by the Byzantines themselves when they moved to capture Antioch in 968. They had installed themselves at Baghras some away and from there conducted a blockade of the city by cutting of its lines of communication. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, was alone in advocating assaulting the city. In the end, the crusaders chose to advance on Antioch and establish a siege close to Antioch. First siege Starting the siege On 20 October 1097 the crusaders reached a fortified crossing, known as Iron Bridge, on the Orontes River outside Antioch. Robert II, Count of Flanders and Adhemar of Le Puy, the Catholic Bishop of Puy-en-Velay, led the charge across the bridge, opening the way for the advancing army. Bohemond of Taranto took a vanguard along the river's south bank and headed towards Antioch on 21 October and the crusaders established themselves outside the city's north wall. The crusaders divided into several groups. Bohemond camped outside Saint Paul's Gate near the northernmost corner of the city walls and immediately to the west were Hugh I, Count of Vermandois; Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy; Robert II, Count of Flanders; and Stephen II, Count of Blois. Adhemar of Le Puy and Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, took up positions outside the Dog Gate either side of where the Orontes penetrated Antioch's defences. Godfrey of Bouillon was stationed west of the Duke's Gate in the northwest of the city walls. The bridge across the Orontes outside Antioch's west walls remained under Yaghi-Siyan's control at this point. The ensuing nine-month siege has been described as \\"one of the great sieges of the age\\". A 14th-century depiction of Robert II, Count of Flanders from a manuscript in the care of the National Library of the Netherlands The sources emphasise that a direct assault would have failed. For instance, Raymond of Aguilers noted that the chaplain of Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, said \\"[Antioch] is so well fortified that it need not fear attack by machinery nor the assault of man, even if all mankind came together against it\\".Quoted by According to Fulcher of Chartres the leaders resolved to maintain the siege until the city was forced into submission. Though his figures may not be accurate, Raymond of Aguilers gave an account of the army defending the city: \\"There were, furthermore, in the city two thousand of the best knights, and four or five thousand common knights and ten thousand more footmen\\".Quoted by One of the problems of camping so close to the city was that it left the besiegers vulnerable to sorties from the garrison and even missiles. For the first fortnight of the siege, the crusaders were able to forage in the surrounding area as the defenders chose not to leave the safety of the city walls. However, in November Yaghi-Siyan learned that the crusaders felt the city would not fall to an assault so was able to turn his attentions from the defensive to harrying the besiegers. He mobilised his cavalry and began harassing the besiegers. With the immediate area stripped clean, the crusaders' foraging parties had to search further afield for supplies leaving them more vulnerable and on several occasions were attacked by the garrisons of nearby fortifications. Yaghi-Siyan's men also used the Dog Bridge, outside the Dog Gate to harass the crusaders. Adhemar of Le Puy and Raymond IV's men, who were camped closest to the bridge, attempted to destroy it using picks and hammers, but made little impact on the strong structure while under missile fire from Antioch's defenders. Another attempt was made to render the bridge unusable, this time with a mobile shelter to protect the crusaders, but the garrison sortied and successfully drove them away. Soon after, three siege engines were built opposite the Dog Gate. In the end, the crusaders erected a blockade on the bridge to obstruct potential sorties. The port of St Symeon on the Mediterranean coast, west of Antioch would allow the crusaders to bring reinforcements. Raymond of Aguilers mentions that the English landed at the port before the crusade reached Antioch, but did not record whether a battle for control of St Symeon took place. Reinforcements in the form of thirteen Genoese ships reached St Symeon on 17 November, and though the route from Antioch to St Symeon ran close to the city walls, meaning the garrison could impede travel, joined up with the rest of the crusaders. According to the Genoese chronicler Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone, the Genoese suffered heavy casualties en route from St Symeon to Antioch. Bohemond's troops built a counterfort outside Saint Paul's Gate in Antioch's northeast wall to protect themselves against missiles from Antioch's defenders. Known as Malregard, the fort was built on a hill and probably consisted of earthen ramparts. The construction has been dated to around the time the Genoese arrived., citing The crusaders were further bolstered by the arrival of Tancred, who set up camp to the west of his uncle, Bohemond. Winter As the crusaders' food supply reached critical levels in December, Godfrey fell ill. On 28 December, Bohemond and Robert of Flanders took about 20,000 men and went foraging for food and plunder upstream of the Orontes. Knowing the crusaders' force had been divided, Yaghi-Siyan waited until the night of 29 December before making a sortie. He attacked Count Raymond's encampment across the river, and though caught by surprise, Count Raymond was able to recover and turn Yaghi-Siyan's men back. He almost succeeded in reversing the attack entirely, forcing a way across the bridge and establishing a foothold on the other side and holding open the city gates. As the crusaders threatened to take the city, a horse lost its rider and, in the ensuing confusion in the dark, the crusaders panicked and withdrew across the bridge with the Turks in pursuit. The stalemate was restored, and both sides had suffered losses. A 13th-century depiction of Bohemond and Tancred from a manuscript in the care of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France While Count Raymond was repulsing a sally from Antioch's garrison, an army under the leadership of Duqaq of Damascus was en route to relieve Antioch. Bohemond and Robert of Flanders were unaware that their foraging party was heading towards Duqaq's men. On 30 December news reached Duqaq while his army was at Shaizar that the crusaders were nearby. On the morning of 31 December Duqaq marched towards Bohemond and Robert's army and the two met at the village of Albara. Robert was the first to encounter Duqaq's men as he was marching ahead of Bohemond. Bohemond joined the battle and with Robert fought back Duqaq's army and inflicted heavy casualties. Though they fought off Duqaq's army, which retreated to Hama, the crusaders suffered too many casualties to keep foraging and returned to Antioch. As a result of the fight the crusaders lost the flock they had gathered for food and returned with less food than they needed. The month ended inauspiciously for both sides: there was an earthquake on 30 December, and the following weeks saw such unseasonably bad rain and cold weather that Duqaq had to return home without further engaging the crusaders. The crusaders feared the rain and earthquake were signs they had lost God's favour, and to atone for their sins such as pillaging, Adhemar of Le Puy ordered that a three-day fast should be observed. In any case at this time supplies were running dangerously low, and soon after one in seven men was dying of starvation. Though local Christians brought food to the crusaders they charged extortionate prices. The famine also affected the horses, and soon only 700 remained. The extent to which the crusader army was affected is difficult to gauge, but according to Matthew of Edessa one in five crusaders died from starvation during the siege and the poorer members were probably worse off. The famine damaged morale and some knights and soldiers began to desert in January 1098, including Peter the Hermit and William the Carpenter. On hearing of the desertion of such prominent figures, Bohemond despatched a force to bring them back. Peter was pardoned while William was berated and made to swear he would remain with the crusade. Spring The arrival of spring in February saw the food situation improve for the crusaders. That month Tatikios repeated his earlier advice to resort to a long-distance blockade but his suggestion was ignored; he then left the army and returned home. Tatikios explained to the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos that Bohemond had informed him that there was a plan to kill him, as they believed Alexios was secretly encouraging the Turks. Those close to Bohemond claimed that this was treachery or cowardice, reason enough to break any obligations to return Antioch to the Byzantines. News arrived that a Turkish army was approaching and Bohemond used the situation to his advantage. He declared that he would leave unless he was allowed to keep Antioch for himself when it was captured. Knowing fully that Bohemond had designs on taking the city for himself, and that he had probably engineered Tatikios' departure in order to facilitate this, Godfrey and Raymond did not give in to his demands, but Bohemond gained the sympathies and cooperation of the minor knights and soldiers. Yaghi-Siyan had reconciled with Ridwan of Aleppo and the advancing army was under his command. In early February news reached the besiegers that Ridwan had taken nearby Harim where he was preparing to advance on Antioch. At Bohemond's suggestion, the crusaders sent all their cavalry (numbering about 700 knights) to meet the advancing army while the infantry remained behind in case Antioch's defenders decided to attack. On the morning of 9 February, Ridwan moved towards the Iron Bridge. The crusaders had moved into position the previous night and charged the advancing army before it reached the bridge. The first charge caused few casualties, but Ridwan's army followed the crusaders to a narrow battlefield. With the river on one side and the Lake of Antioch on the other, Ridwan was unable to outflank the crusaders and exploit his superior numbers. A second charge had more impact and the Turkish army withdrew in disorder. At the same time, Yaghi-Siyan had led his garrison out of Antioch and attacked the crusader infantry. His offensive was forcing the besiegers back until the knights returned. Realising Ridwan had been defeated, Yaghi-Siyan retreated inside the city. As Ridwan's army passed through Harim panic spread to the garrison he had installed there and they abandoned the town, which was retaken by the Christians. According to Orderic Vitalis an English fleet led by Edgar √Ütheling, the exiled Saxon claimant to the throne of England, arrived at St Symeon on 4 March carrying supplies from the Byzantines. Historian Steven Runciman repeated the assertion, however it is unknown where the fleet originated and would not have been under Edgar's command. Regardless, the fleet brought raw materials for constructing siege engines, but these were almost lost on the journey from the port to Antioch when part of the garrison sallied out. Bohemond and Raymond escorted the material, and after losing some of the materials and 100 people, they fell back to the crusader camp outside Antioch. Before Bohemond and Raymond, rumours that they had been killed reached Godfrey who readied his men to rescue the survivors of the escort. However, his attention was diverted when another force sallied from the city to provide cover for the men returning from the ambush. Godfrey was able to hold off the attack until Bohemond and Raymond came to his aid. The reorganised army then caught up with the garrison before it had reached the safety of Antioch's walls. The counter-attack was a success for the crusaders and resulted in the deaths of between 1,200 and 1,500 of Antioch's defenders. The crusaders set to work building siege engines, as well as a fort, called La Mahomerie, to block the Bridge Gate and prevent Yaghi-Siyan attacking the crusader supply line from the ports of Saint Simon and Alexandretta, whilst also repairing the abandoned monastery to the west of the Gate of Saint George, which was still being used to deliver food to the city. Tancred garrisoned the monastery, referred to in the chronicles as Tancred's Fort, for 400 silver marks, whilst Count Raymond of Toulouse took control of La Mahomerie. Finally the crusader siege was able to have some effect on the well-defended city. Food conditions improved for the crusaders as spring approached and the city was sealed off from raiders. Fatimid embassy In April a Fatimid embassy from Egypt arrived at the crusader camp, hoping to establish a peace with the Christians, who were, after all, the enemy of their own enemies, the Seljuks. Peter the Hermit was sent to negotiate. These negotiations came to nothing. The Fatimids, assuming the crusaders were simply mercenary representatives of the Byzantines, were prepared to let the crusaders keep Syria if they agreed not to attack Fatimid Palestine, a state of affairs perfectly acceptable between Egypt and Byzantium before the Turkish invasions. But the crusaders could not accept any settlement that did not give them Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the Fatimids were treated hospitably and were given many gifts, plundered from the Turks who had been defeated in March, and no definitive agreement was reached. Capture of Antioch A 14th-century depiction of the crusaders' capture of Antioch from a manuscript in the care of the National Library of the Netherlands The siege continued, and at the end of May 1098 a Muslim army from Mosul under the command of Kerbogha approached Antioch. This army was much larger than the previous attempts to relieve the siege. Kerbogha had joined with Ridwan and Duqaq and his army also included troops from Persia and from the Ortuqids of Mesopotamia. The crusaders were luckily granted time to prepare for their arrival, as Kerbogha had first made a three-week-long excursion to Edessa, which he was unable to recapture from Baldwin of Boulogne, who had taken it earlier in 1098. Bohemond and his Norman troops scale the walls of Antioch, in an engraving by Gustave Dor√© The massacre of Antioch, in an engraving by Gustave Dor√© The crusaders knew they would have to take the city before Kerbogha arrived if they had any chance of survival. Weeks earlier, Bohemond had secretly established contact with someone inside the city named Firouz, an Armenian guard who controlled the Tower of the Two Sisters. Firouz's motivation was unclear even to Bohemond, perhaps avarice or revenge, but he offered to let Bohemond into the city in exchange for money and a title. Bohemond then approached the other crusaders and offered access to the city, through Firouz, if they would agree to make Bohemond the Prince of Antioch. Raymond was furious and argued that the city should be handed over to Alexios, as they had agreed when they left Constantinople in 1097, but Godfrey, Tancred, Robert, and the other leaders, faced with a desperate situation, gave in to Bohemond's demand. Despite this, on 2 June, Stephen of Blois and some of the other crusaders deserted the army. Later on the same day, Firouz instructed Bohemond to feign a march south over the mountains to ostensibly confront Kerbogha, but then to double-back at night and scale the walls at the Tower of the Two Sisters where Firouz held watch. This was done. Firouz allowed a small contingent of crusaders to scale the tower (including Bohemond), who then opened a nearby postern gate allowing a larger contingent of soldiers hiding in the nearby rocks to enter the city and overwhelm the alerted garrison. The crusaders subsequently massacred thousands of Christian civilians along with Muslims, unable to tell them apart, including Firouz's own brother. Yaghi-Siyan fled but was captured by Armenian and Syrian Christians some distance outside the city. His severed head was brought to Bohemond. Second siege An illustration of Kerbogha besieging Antioch, from a 14th-century manuscript in the care of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France By the end of the day on 3 June, the crusaders controlled most of the city, except for the citadel, which remained in the hands of Yaghi-Siyan's son Shams ad-Daulah. John the Oxite was reinstated as patriarch by Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate, who wished to keep good relations with the Byzantines, especially as Bohemond was clearly planning to claim the city for himself. However, the city was now short on food, and Kerbogha's army was still on its way. Kerbogha arrived only two days later, on 5 June. He tried, and failed, to storm the city on 7 June, and by 9 June he had established his own siege around the city. More crusaders had deserted before Kerbogha arrived, and they joined Stephen of Blois in Tarsus. Stephen had seen Kerbogha's army encamped near Antioch and assumed all hope was lost; the deserters confirmed his fears. On the way back to Constantinople, Stephen and the other deserters met Alexios, who was on his way to assist the crusaders, and did not know they had taken the city and were now under siege themselves. Stephen convinced him that the rest of the crusaders were as good as dead, and Alexios heard from his reconnaissance that there was another Seljuk army nearby in Anatolia. He therefore decided to return to Constantinople rather than risking battle. Discovery of the Holy Lance Discovery of the Holy Lance Meanwhile, in Antioch, on 10 June an otherwise insignificant priest from southern France by the name of Peter Bartholomew came forward claiming to have had visions of St. Andrew, who told him that the Holy Lance was inside the city. The starving crusaders were prone to visions and hallucinations, and another monk named Stephen of Valence reported visions of Christ and the Virgin Mary. On 14 June a meteor was seen landing in the enemy camp, interpreted as a good omen. Although Adhemar was suspicious, as he had seen a relic of the Holy Lance in Constantinople, Raymond believed Peter. Raymond, Raymond of Aguilers, William, Bishop of Orange, and others began to dig in the cathedral of Saint Peter on 15 June, and when they came up empty, Peter went into the pit, reached down, and produced a spear point. Raymond took this as a divine sign that they would survive and thus prepared for a final fight rather than surrender. Peter then reported another vision, in which St. Andrew instructed the crusader army to fast for five days (although they were already starving), after which they would be victorious. Bohemond was skeptical of the Holy Lance as well, but there is no question that its discovery increased the morale of the crusaders. It is also possible that Peter was reporting what Bohemond wanted (rather than what St. Andrew wanted) as Bohemond knew, from spies in Kerbogha's camp, that the various factions frequently argued with each other. Kerbogha of Mosul was indeed suspected by most emirs to yearn for sovereignty in Syria and often considered as a bigger threat to their interests than the Christian invaders. On 27 June, Peter the Hermit was sent by Bohemond to negotiate with Kerbogha, but this proved futile and battle with the Turks was thus unavoidable. Bohemond drew up six divisions: he commanded one himself, and the other five were led by Hugh of Vermandois and Robert of Flanders, Godfrey, Robert of Normandy, Adhemar, and Tancred and Gaston IV of B√©arn. Raymond, who had fallen ill, remained inside to guard the citadel with 200 men, now held by Ahmed Ibn Merwan an agent of Kerbogha. Battle of Antioch A 13th-century depiction of battle outside Antioch from William of Tyre's Histoire d'Outremer, in the care of the British Museum On Monday 28 June the crusaders emerged from the city gate, with Raymond of Aguilers carrying the Holy Lance before them. Kerbogha hesitated against his generals' pleadings, hoping to attack them all at once rather than one division at a time, but he underestimated their size. He pretended to retreat to draw the crusaders to rougher terrain, while his archers continuously pelted the advancing crusaders with arrows. A detachment was dispatched to the crusader left wing, which was not protected by the river, but Bohemond quickly formed a seventh division and beat them back. The Turks were inflicting many casualties, including Adhemar's standard-bearer, and Kerbogha set fire to the grass between his position and the crusaders, but this did not deter them: they had visions of three saints riding along with them: St. George, St. Mercurius, and St. Demetrius. The battle was brief and disastrous for the Turks. Duqaq deserted Kerbogha and this desertion reduced the great numerical advantage the Muslim army had over its Christian opponents. Soon the defeated Muslim troops were in panicked retreat. Aftermath The crusaders decided not to return Antioch to Byzantine emperor, Alexios I, depicted here in a drawing of around 1300. As Kerbogha fled, the citadel under command of Ahmed ibn Merwan finally surrendered, but only to Bohemond personally, rather than to Raymond; this seems to have been arranged beforehand without Raymond's knowledge. As expected, Bohemond claimed the city as his own although Adhemar and Raymond disagreed. Hugh of Vermandois and Baldwin of Hainaut were sent to Constantinople, although Baldwin disappeared after an ambush on the way.By Gislebertus (of Mons), Laura Napran, Chronicle of Hainaut, 2005 Alexios, however, was uninterested in sending an expedition to claim the city this late in the summer. Back in Antioch, Bohemond argued that Alexios had deserted the crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. Bohemond and Raymond occupied Yaghi-Siyan's palace, but Bohemond controlled most of the rest of the city and flew his standard from the citadel. It is a common assumption that the Franks of northern France, the Provencals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate \\"nations\\" and that each wanted to increase its status. This may have had something to do with the disputes, but personal ambition is more likely the cause of the infighting. Peter Bartholomew undergoing the ordeal of fire, by Gustave Dor√©. Soon an epidemic broke out, possibly of typhus, and on 1 August Adhemar of le Puy died. In September the leaders of the crusade wrote to Pope Urban II, asking him to take personal control of Antioch, but he declined. For the rest of 1098, they took control of the countryside surrounding Antioch, although there were now even fewer horses than before, and Muslim peasants refused to give them food. The minor knights and soldiers became restless and starvation began to set in and they threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. In November, Raymond finally gave in to Bohemond for the sake of continuing the crusade in peace and to calm his mutinous starving troops. At the beginning of 1099 the march was renewed, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch, and in the spring the Siege of Jerusalem began under the leadership of Raymond. The success at Antioch was too much for Peter Bartholomew's skeptics. Peter's visions were far too convenient and too martial, and he was openly accused of lying. Challenged, Peter offered to undergo ordeal by fire to prove that he was divinely guided. Being in Biblical lands, they chose a Biblical ordeal: Peter would pass through a fiery furnace and would be protected by an angel of God. The crusaders constructed a path between walls of flame; Peter would walk down the path between the flames. He did so, and was horribly burned. He died after suffering in agony for twelve days on 20 April 1099. There was no more said about the Holy Lance, although one faction continued to hold that Peter was genuine and that this was indeed the true Lance. The Siege of Antioch quickly became legendary, and in the 12th century it was the subject of the chanson d'Antioche, a chanson de geste in the Crusade cycle. See also Artah.

He was severely wounded and lost a leg, but this did not prevent him returning to the army and taking a colonelcy even before he was fully recovered. After the close of the war Colonel Henderson and Fox were married. Fox was a native of Ohio, but moved to Iowa at an early age. They had two daughters and one son. The elder daughter married Samuel Peaslee, and the other daughter, Isabelle, was an accomplished musician. Civil War service and wounds He served in the Union Army during the Civil War and was wounded severely twice, once in the neck and later in the leg, which resulted in progressive amputations of that leg. He initially enlisted in the Union Army on September 15, 1861, as a private in Company C, 12th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was elected and commissioned first lieutenant of that company. In the Battle of Fort Donelson, he was shot in the neck in the final charge over the breastworks.Brigham, Johnson Iowa: Its History and Its Foremost Citizens, pp. 595 (S.J. Clarke, 1918, Iowa History Project). After returning to the Regiment in April 1862, he lost one foot and part of one leg at the Second Battle of Corinth in October 1862.\\"The Operation Successful,\\" New York Times, 1894-02-12 at p. 1, and Logan, Guy E., Roster and Record of Iowa Troops In the Rebellion, Vol. 1, 12th Infantry Regiment . He was discharged on February 26, 1863 due to his wounds, and returned to Iowa. After serving as commissioner of the board of enrollment of the third district of Iowa from May 1863 to June 1864, he re-entered the Army as colonel of the new 46th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, one of the \\"Hundred Days Men\\" regiments, and commanded the Regiment until it was mustered out in September 1864.Logan, Guy E., Roster and Record of Iowa Troops In the Rebellion, Vol. 1, 46th Infantry Regiment. Law practice He was a successful lawyer prior to pursuing his political career. After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1865 and commenced practice in Dubuque. He was the collector of internal revenue for the third district of Iowa from November 1865 to June 1869, when he resigned to accept a position as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, where he served until 1871. He was in private practice in Dubuque until 1882. Congressman and chairman In 1882, he was elected as a Republican to represent Iowa's 3rd congressional district in the U.S. House, where he served from March 4, 1883 to March 4, 1903. He first ran for Speaker of the House when the 51st Congress convened in 1889,\\"M'Kinley is in the Lead,\\" New York Times, 1888-12-07 at p.1. finishing well behind Thomas Brackett Reed and runner-up William McKinley.\\"Counting their Votes,\\" New York Times, 1889-11-24 at p. 1. He served as the chairman of the Committee on Militia (in the 51st Congress), and chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary (in the 54th and 55th congresses). He was also the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Appropriations during the 52nd and 53rd congresses, when the House had a Democratic majority. When Republicans regained the majority after the 1894 elections, Speaker Reed departed with tradition by returning the chairmanship to Joseph Gurney Cannon, who had served more nonconsecutive terms in the House and would have outranked Henderson had Cannon not lost his House seat for two years. Henderson was an aggressive debater and an intense Republican partisan. He seems to have loved a fight; he got into enough of them from his very first term, exercising his power of personal vituperation and abuse against Democrats whenever he found grounds to do so. \\"I would rather spend an eternity in hell with a Confederate than an eternity in heaven with a northern Copperhead,\\" he told one crowd.Dubuque Daily Herald, September 9, 10, 11, 1886. His secret for political success came from combining mainstream Republican causes with those dear to the hearts of his farmland constituency. In the summer of 1886, he led House forces in favor of levying a high tax on oleomargarine. At the same time he sponsored a bill to raise the benefits for veterans' widows by fifty percent. (On the final passage of another bill he favored, increasing the pensions of disabled veterans, Henderson withheld his vote, since he would stand among the beneficiaries). His commitment to pension legislation, general and individual, marked his whole career and took up most of his time. No member did more than he in that respect.Chicago Tribune, October 16, 1886. Speaker of the House David B. Henderson With the support of fellow \\"western state\\" Republicans, Henderson was elected to succeed Reed as Speaker following Reed's resignation from the post in 1899.\\"National Capital Topics: Henderson's Election as Speaker Considered a Certainty,\\" New York Times, 1899-06-04 at p. 13. During his two terms as speaker (in the 56th and 57th congresses), Henderson, by longstanding tradition also held the role as chairman of the Committee on Rules. On September 16, 1902 - with the next Congressional election less than two months away - Henderson surprised nearly everyone by announcing that he was withdrawing from the race for re-election (and thus from Congress).\\"Surprise in Washington,\\" New York Times, 1902-09-17 at p. 1. Various explanations for his abrupt withdrawal have been offered. Henderson's letter announcing his decision referred to \\"a growing sentiment, among Republicans, that I do not truly represent their views on the tariff question.\\"\\"Speaker Henderson will not run again,\\" New York Times, 1902-09-17 at p. 1. Some attributed his decision to the lingering effects of his war injuries. In a letter to Henderson‚Äôs successor Joe Cannon dated three days after Henderson's announcement, former House Clerk Henry H. Smith stated that \\"there can be but one explanation of the reason for his action [the resignation] . . . they relate not alone to poker playing, but to his alleged intimacy with a certain \`lobbyess' who is reported to have some written evidence that would greatly embarrass the Speaker. . . . He seemed to have lost all control of himself and become reckless. . . . This is not mere guesswork at all but private and reliable information which I am sure you will recognize when I tell you the name.\\" - Waltzman, Forest, and Lawrence, Eric, \\"Why Did Speaker Henderson Resign? The Page 799 Mystery is Solved,\\" 41 Public Affairs Report No. 4, September 2000, accessed on 2009-09-19. Whatever the cause, Henderson's resignation ushered in the beginning of Cannon's famous tenure as Speaker. Death and honors After leaving Congress, Henderson practiced law in New York City until health problems caused him to retire to Southern California. Henderson died in Dubuque on February 25, 1906, aged 65. He is buried at Linwood Cemetery in Dubuque. His portrait hangs in the speakers' room in the U.S. Capitol, and statues of Henderson by J. Massey Rhind are found in the collections of the Iowa State Historical Society and in Clermont. \\"Allison- Henderson Park,\\" in Dubuque, shares his name with that of six-term U.S. Senator William B.

Sir Amias Paulet, Mary's gaoler, is identified as 3, top, seated left below dais; the official witnesses, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, are identified as numbers 1 and 2. Sir Amias Paulet (1532 ‚Äì 26 September 1588) of Hinton St. George, Somerset, was an English diplomat, Governor of Jersey, and the gaoler for a period of Mary, Queen of Scots. Origins He was the son of Sir Hugh Paulet of Hinton St George by his wife Philippa Pollard, a daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard (c.1465 ‚Äì 21 October 1526), Justice of the Common Pleas, of King's Nympton, Devon. Career Paulet went to Jersey in 1550 when his father was made Governor and immediately acted as his assistant. The following year he was sent by his father to complain to the Privy Council that officials in Normandy were refusing to hand over six thieves who had escaped from Jersey. He was sent to Paris with a letter for the Constable of France, and thence to Normandy, returning ultimately to Jersey with his prisoners. In 1556 he was formally appointed Lieutenant-Governor and by the end of the decade he was effectively running the island in his father's absence. He kept this post until 1573. His father Hugh died that year, and Paulet was made Governor, a post he held until his death. There was much concern at this time about invasion by the French and Paulet went on a spying mission to the Brittany coast to discover for himself whether ships and troops were being gathered. Nothing happened because the death of the French king brought a temporary cessation to threats against the Channel Islands. However, relations with nearby Normandy were not good, as shown by a letter from Amias to his father: > Mr St Aubin has been arrested by Mons Boisrougier of Coutances, and after > fourteen days imprisonment dismissed with the loss of a goshawk and 20 ells > of canvas. I wrote to this Monsieur for redress, but he answered he was > sorry he had dismissed his prisoner, and that his stock was not better, > advising me to look to myself, as he hoped to pluck me out of my house, as > he had the Captain of Alderney. If I had the Queen's leave, I would ask no > aid but the retinue of this Castle to pluck him out of his house. Amias continued his father's work on strengthening Mont Orguiel Castle, despite the lack of funds available from Elizabeth. He wrote in 1557: \\"Though I have husbanded Her Majesty's money well I have been constrained to employ more than I received, and our walls want a third part yet\\". And in 1563: \\"I am much deceived, considering the depth of the foundation, the height and thickness of the walls, if a greater piece of work hath ever been done for the like sum\\". And again in 1573: \\"A strong piece of work, begun four or five years ago, lacks completion of one third. Four hundred pounds will be needed this year and four hundred next.\\" Like his father, Amias was strongly anti- Catholic, although more Calvinist than Protestant. When the first Huguenot refugees poured into Jersey in 1558 he appointed some of the priests among them as Rectors and ignored his father's wishes, and to an extent those of Queen Elizabeth, over which prayer book should be used in island churches. His appointment to the Town Church of Guillaume Morise, a Huguenot minister from Anjou, led to the establishment of what Chroniques de Jersey described as the first \\"real Reformed Church in Jersey\\". There was a second influx of Huguenots in 1568 and they, too, were welcomed by Amias, although his father had reservations and wrote: \\"I approve my son's zeal in receiving these strangers, but I cannot like their continued abode in the isle. They should be passed on.\\" But father and son got on well, despite these occasional disagreements, and in 1571 Amias was made joint-Governor, becoming sole Governor on his father's death, probably in 1578, although there are no records of the transition. In 1576 Queen Elizabeth raised him to knighthood, appointed him Ambassador to Paris and at the same time put the young Francis Bacon under his charge. Paulet was in this embassy until he was recalled November 1579. In 1579, he took into his household, the young Jean Hotman, son of Francis Hotman, to tutor his two sons Anthony and George. When the family returned to England, the tutor and his two charges settled at Oxford. His duties increasingly meant that Amias was absent from the island for long periods. He was appointed resident Ambassador in France for three years in 1576 and appointed Guillaume Lempriere, Seigneur of Trinity, his Lieutenant-Governor. He was clearly well trusted, because Queen Elizabeth's principal secretary Sir Francis Walsingham wrote: \\"Her Majesty wishes you in matters that concern her service to deal as you think fit, though you have no special direction, such trust she reposes in you.\\" He was present in Jersey in 1583 for the swearing- in of his son Anthony as Lieutenant-Governor and his brother George as Bailiff, before leaving to join the Privy Council. A fanatical Puritan with a harsh character, Paulet was appointed gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Elizabeth in January 1585, at Chartley Castle, and guarded her very strictly. He replaced the more tolerant Sir Ralph Sadler who had given Mary far more liberty.Antonia Fraser, Mary, Queen of Scots, 'pp. 548‚Äì49 He remained her keeper until Mary's execution at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587. After Mary's conviction, Walsingham wrote to Paulet requesting he assassinate Mary, to spare Elizabeth from involvement in her death. In a letter to Walsingham, Paulet refused to \\"make so great a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, as shed blood without law or warrant\\". He was the appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. Marriage and progeny He married Margaret Harvey, a daughter of Antony Harvey, of Columbjohn in Devon, an \\"expert surveyor\\",Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.171 by whom he had three sons and three daughters: * Hugh Paulet (b. 1558), the eldest son, who predeceased his father. * Anthony Paulet (b. 1562), eldest surviving son and heir, who also succeeded his father as Governor of Jersey.

Early life  Frederick H. Gillett was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, to Edward Bates Gillett (1817‚Äì1899) and Lucy Fowler Gillett (1830‚Äì1916). He graduated from Amherst College, where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, in 1874 and Harvard Law School in 1877. He entered the practice of law in Springfield in 1877.  Career  Time cover, 17 Nov 1924 Gillett was the Assistant Attorney General of Massachusetts from 1879 to 1882. For two one-year terms he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was elected to the Fifty-third United States Congress in 1892. A Republican, Gillett served in the United States House of Representatives from 1893 to 1925. On January 24, 1914, he introduced legislation to initiate the adoption of an Anti-Polygamy Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Republicans won a net total of 24 seats in the 1918 elections, increasing the size of their majority in the House. Gillett was nominated by the Republican caucus for Speaker of the House in the upcoming 66th United States Congress. On May 19, 1919, Congress convened, and he was elected speaker, defeating the Democratic incumbent Champ Clark 228‚Äì172. Gillett was expected to exercise less control than his predecessor, since he was characterized by one reporter as someone who did not drink coffee in the morning \\"for fear it would keep him awake all day\\". He was reelected as speaker in 1921 and again in 1923. He decided to run for the United States Senate in 1924. He won the Republican primary easily over two other candidates and then narrowly defeated incumbent Senator David I. Walsh in the Republican landslide of November 1924 led by President Calvin Coolidge, a former governor of Massachusetts. Time magazine chose him for its November 17, 1924, cover. He served one term in the Senate from 1925 to 1931, and decided not to seek re- election in the face of a difficult primary challenge. In June 1930, he declined to state his position on prohibition or its repeal when queried by prohibition advocates.  Personal life  On November 25, 1915, Gillett married Christine Rice Hoar, the widow of his former colleague in Congress, Rockwood Hoar. In 1934 he published a biography of George Frisbie Hoar, an earlier congressman and senator from Massachusetts, and his wife's father-in- law from her previous marriage. During his time in Washington, Gillett spent his free time driving his 1926 Pontiac Coupe and playing golf in the morning. In retirement he wintered in Pasadena, California. He died in a hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts, on July 31, 1935.  Legacy  Frederick Gillett in 1920 As of 2019, Gillett is the most recent Speaker of the House to have also served in the U.S. Senate. He was also the longest-tenured incumbent congressman to have ever been elected to the Senate until June 2013, when Representative Ed Markey was elected to the same Senate seat that Gillett held.

(1991). \\"Definition of Dysgraphia (Handwriting Difficulty). Dyslexia A2Z. Retrieved from http://www.dyslexiaa2z.com/learning_difficulties/dysgraphia/dysgraphia_definition.html Dysgraphia is a transcription disability, meaning that it is a writing disorder associated with impaired handwriting, orthographic coding, and finger sequencing (the movement of muscles required to write). It often overlaps with other learning disabilities such as speech impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or developmental coordination disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), dysgraphia is characterized as a learning disability in the category of written expression when one's writing skills are below those expected given a person's age measured through intelligence and age-appropriate education. The DSM is not clear in whether or not writing refers only to the motor skills involved in writing, or if it also includes orthographic skills and spelling. The word dysgraphia comes from the Greek words dys meaning \\"impaired\\" and Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± graph√≠a meaning \\"writing by hand\\". There are at least two stages in the act of writing: the linguistic stage and the motor-expressive-praxic stage. The linguistic stage involves the encoding of auditory and visual information into symbols for letters and written words. This is mediated through the angular gyrus, which provides the linguistic rules which guide writing. The motor stage is where the expression of written words or graphemes is articulated. This stage is mediated by Exner's writing area of the frontal lobe. People with dysgraphia can often write on some level and may experience difficulty with other fine motor skills, such as tying shoes. However, dysgraphia does not affect all fine motor skills. People with dysgraphia often have unusual difficulty with handwriting and spelling which in turn can cause writing fatigue. They may lack basic grammar and spelling skills (for example, having difficulties with the letters p, q, b, and d), and often will write the wrong word when trying to formulate their thoughts on paper. The disorder generally emerges when the child is first introduced to writing. Adults, teenagers, and children alike are all subject to dysgraphia. Dysgraphia should be distinguished from agraphia, which is an acquired loss of the ability to write resulting from brain injury, stroke, or progressive illness. Classification Dysgraphia is nearly always accompanied by other learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder, and this can impact the type of dysgraphia a person might have. Tourette‚Äôs syndrome and ASD are other common problems among dysgraphic individuals.There are three principal subtypes of dysgraphia that are recognized. There is little information available about different types of dysgraphia and there are likely more subtypes than the ones listed below. Some children may have a combination of two or more of these, and individual symptoms may vary in presentation from what is described here. Most common presentation is a motor dysgraphia/agraphia resulting from damage to some part of the motor cortex in the parietal lobes. Dyslexic People with dyslexic dysgraphia have illegible spontaneously written work. Their copied work is fairly good, but their spelling is usually poor. Their finger tapping speed (a method for identifying fine motor problems) is normal, indicating that the deficit does not likely stem from cerebellar damage. A Dyslexic Dysgraphic does not necessarily have dyslexia (dyslexia and dysgraphia appear to be unrelated). Motor Dysgraphia can be difficult to diagnose because the handwriting starts out clear and slowly degrades, making the writer appear lazy. Motor dysgraphia is due to deficient fine motor skills, poor dexterity, poor muscle tone, or unspecified motor clumsiness. Letter formation may be acceptable in very short samples of writing, but this requires extreme effort and an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish, and it cannot be sustained for a significant length of time, as it can cause arthritis-like tensing of the hand. Overall, their written work is poor to illegible even if copied by sight from another document, and drawing is difficult. Oral spelling for these individuals is normal, and their finger tapping speed is below normal. This shows that there are problems within the fine motor skills of these individuals. People with developmental coordination disorder may be dysgraphic. Writing is often slanted due to holding a pen or pencil incorrectly. Spatial A person with spatial dysgraphia has a defect in the understanding of space. They will have illegible spontaneously written work, illegible copied work, and problems with drawing abilities. They have normal spelling and normal finger tapping speed, suggesting that this subtype is not fine motor based. Symptoms in actuality may vary in presentation from what is listed here. Signs and symptoms The symptoms to dysgraphia are often overlooked or attributed to the student being lazy, unmotivated, not caring, or having delayed visual-motor processing. In order to be diagnosed with dysgraphia, one must have a cluster, but not necessarily all, of the following symptoms: Dysgraphia may cause students emotional trauma often due to the fact that no one can read their writing, and they are aware that they are not performing to the same level as their peers. Emotional problems that may occur alongside dysgraphia include impaired self-esteem, lowered self- efficacy, heightened anxiety, and depression. They may put in extra efforts in order to have the same achievements as their peers, but often get frustrated because they feel that their hard work does not pay off. Dysgraphia is a hard disorder to detect as it does not affect specific ages, gender, or intelligence. The main concern in trying to detect dysgraphia is that people hide their disability behind their verbal fluency because they are ashamed that they cannot achieve the same goals as their peers. Having dysgraphia is not related to a lack of cognitive ability, and it is not uncommon in intellectually gifted individuals, but due to dysgraphia their intellectual abilities are often not identified. Associated conditions There are some common problems not related to dysgraphia but often associated with dysgraphia, the most common of which is stress. Often children (and adults) with dysgraphia will become extremely frustrated with the task of writing specially on plain paper (and spelling); younger children may cry, pout, or refuse to complete written assignments. This frustration can cause the child (or adult) a great deal of stress and can lead to stress-related illnesses. This can be a result of any symptom of dysgraphia. Causes Dysgraphia is a biologically based disorder with genetic and brain bases. More specifically, it is a working memory problem. In dysgraphia, individuals fail to develop normal connections among different brain regions needed for writing. People with dysgraphia have difficulty in automatically remembering and mastering the sequence of motor movements required to write letters or numbers. Dysgraphia is also in part due to underlying problems in orthographic coding, the orthographic loop, and graphmotor output (the movements that result in writing) by one's hands, fingers and executive functions involved in letter writing. The orthographic loop is when written words are stored in the mind's eye, connected through sequential finger movement for motor output through the hand with feedback from the eye.  Diagnosis  Several tests exist to diagnose dysgraphia like Ajuriaguerra scale, BHK for children or teenagers, DASH and HHE scale. With devices like drawing tablets, it is now possible to measure the position, tilt, and pressure in real time. From these features, it is possible to compute automatic features like speed and shaking and train a classifier to diagnose automatically children with atypical writing. Treatment Treatment for dysgraphia varies and may include treatment for motor disorders to help control writing movements. The use of occupational therapy can be effective in the school setting, and teachers should be well informed about dysgraphia to aid in carry-over of the occupational therapist's interventions. Treatments may address impaired memory or other neurological problems. Some physicians recommend that individuals with dysgraphia use computers to avoid the problems of handwriting. Dysgraphia can sometimes be partially overcome with appropriate and conscious effort and training. The International Dyslexia Association suggests the use of kinesthetic memory through early training by having the child overlearn how to write letters and to later practice writing with their eyes closed or averted to reinforce the feel of the letters being written. They also suggest teaching the students cursive writing as it has fewer reversible letters and can help lessen spacing problems, at least within words, because cursive letters are generally attached within a word. School There is no special education category for students with dysgraphia; in the United States, The National Center for Learning Disabilities suggests that children with dysgraphia be handled in a case-by-case manner with an Individualized Education Program, or provided individual accommodation to provide alternative ways of submitting work and modify tasks to avoid the area of weakness. Students with dysgraphia often cannot complete written assignments that are legible, appropriate in length and content, or within given time. It is suggested that students with dysgraphia receive specialized instructions that are appropriate for them. Children will mostly benefit from explicit and comprehensive instructions, help translating across multiple levels of language, and review and revision of assignments or writing methods. Direct, explicit instruction on letter formation and guided practice will help students achieve automatic handwriting performance before they use letters to write words, phrases, and sentences. Some older children may benefit from the use of a personal computer or a laptop in class so that they do not have to deal with the frustration of falling behind their peers. It is also suggested by Berninger that teachers with dysgraphic students decide if their focus will be on manuscript writing (printing) or keyboarding. In either case, it is beneficial that students are taught how to read cursive writing as it is used daily in classrooms by some teachers. It may also be beneficial for the teacher to come up with other methods of assessing a child's knowledge other than written tests; an example would be oral testing. This causes less frustration for the child as they are able to get their knowledge across to the teacher without worrying about how to write their thoughts. The number of students with dysgraphia may increase from 4 percent of students in primary grades, due to the overall difficulty of handwriting, and up to 20 percent in middle school because written compositions become more complex. With this in mind, there are no exact numbers of how many individuals have dysgraphia due to its difficulty to diagnose. There are slight gender differences in association with written disabilities; overall it is found that males are more likely to be impaired with handwriting, composing, spelling, and orthographic abilities than females. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) doesn't use the term dysgraphia but uses the phrase \\"an impairment in written expression\\" under the category of \\"specific learning disorder\\". This is the term used by most doctors and psychologists. To qualify for special education services, a child must have an issue named or described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While IDEA doesn't use the term \\"dysgraphia\\", it describes it under the category of \\"specific learning disability\\". This includes issues with understanding or using language (spoken or written) that make it difficult to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or to do mathematical calculations.

The film was only released in one theater in the United States (in New York City) for three weeks where it grossed $17,790. Plot Cynthia (Zhang Ziyi) and a Japanese student, Itami (T√¥ru Nakamura), have fallen in love in Japanese controlled Manchukuo prior to the war when Itami is forced to return to Japan. Years later, in Shanghai, Szeto (Liu Ye) and Tang Yiling (Li Bingbing) have fallen in love. Cynthia has also returned to Shanghai now as a member of Purple Butterfly, a powerful resistance group against the Japanese occupation, led by Xie Ming (Feng Yuanzheng). After a case of mistaken identity and a shootout at a railroad station that leaves Yiling dead, Szeto finds himself an unexpected pawn in the battle between former lovers Cynthia and Itami who has also come to Shanghai, now as a member of the Japanese secret police unit tasked with dismantling Purple Butterfly. Cast * Zhang Ziyi as Cynthia * T≈çru Nakamura as Hidehiko Itami * Liu Ye as Szeto * Feng Yuanzheng as Xie Ming * Li Bingbing as Tang Yiling * Lan Yan as A Zi * Kin Ei as Yamamoto  Reception  With the success of Lou's previous film, Suzhou River (2000), Purple Butterfly was an anticipated follow up with a considerably larger budget. The film received polarizing receptions. Rotten Tomatoes records a 45% \\"rotten\\" rating. Metacritic records the film received a 68 score out of 100, meaning \\"generally favorable reviews\\". G. Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle describes the film as \\"a gorgeously shot, ambitious epic\\". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film, \\"a remarkable period piece, evoking the bustling, dense and increasingly dangerous Shanghai of the '30s\\". Thomas praised Zhang as an actress with \\"formidable resources\\" and \\"has that crucial gift of holding herself in check at just the right moments for maximum dramatic impact and psychological complexity\\". Thomas further state the film is \\"suspenseful, atmospheric and sometimes puzzling\\". However, other critics saw the film as technically masterful but a case where style had trumped substance. In particular the film's labyrinthine and difficult to follow plot was pointed to as a major point of complaint. One such review by Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post- Intelligencer called the film \\"lush but confusing\\", and states \\"Purple Butterfly is rich with emotional turmoil and searing beauty, but it could have used a little more time in the editing room to make sense of it all.\\"  References   External links  Purple Butterfly at MonkeyPeaches *Purple Butterfly at HelloZiyi.us Category:2003 films Category:Chinese films Category:Chinese war drama films Category:Second Sino-Japanese War films Category:Chinese neo-noir films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Films set in Shanghai Category:Films directed by Lou Ye Category:Films set in Manchukuo Category:Japan in non- Japanese culture ","title":"Purple Butterfly"},{"id":"1119342","text":"Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) results from transferring spin polarization from electrons to nuclei, thereby aligning the nuclear spins to the extent that electron spins are aligned. Note that the alignment of electron spins at a given magnetic field and temperature is described by the Boltzmann distribution under the thermal equilibrium. It is also possible that those electrons are aligned to a higher degree of order by other preparations of electron spin order such as: chemical reactions (leading to Chemical-Induced DNP, CIDNP), optical pumping and spin injection. DNP is considered one of several techniques for hyperpolarization. DNP can also be induced using unpaired electrons produced by radiation damage in solids. When electron spin polarization deviates from its thermal equilibrium value, polarization transfers between electrons and nuclei can occur spontaneously through electron-nuclear cross relaxation and/or spin-state mixing among electrons and nuclei. For example, the polarization transfer is spontaneous after a homolysis chemical reaction. On the other hand, when the electron spin system is in a thermal equilibrium, the polarization transfer requires continuous microwave irradiation at a frequency close to the corresponding electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequency. In particular, mechanisms for the microwave-driven DNP processes are categorized into the Overhauser effect (OE), the solid-effect (SE), the cross-effect (CE) and thermal-mixing (TM). The first DNP experiments were performed in the early 1950s at low magnetic fields but until recently the technique was of limited applicability for high- frequency, high-field NMR spectroscopy, because of the lack of microwave (or terahertz) sources operating at the appropriate frequency. Today such sources are available as turn-key instruments, making DNP a valuable and indispensable method especially in the field of structure determination by high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy Mechanisms The Overhauser effect DNP was first realized using the concept of the Overhauser effect, which is the perturbation of nuclear spin level populations observed in metals and free radicals when electron spin transitions are saturated by microwave irradiation. This effect relies on stochastic interactions between an electron and a nucleus. The 'dynamic' initially meant to highlight the time-dependent and random interactions in this polarization transfer process. The DNP phenomenon was theoretically predicted by Albert Overhauser in 1953 and initially drew some criticism from Norman Ramsey, Felix Bloch and other renowned physicists of the time on the grounds of being \\"thermodynamically improbable\\". The experimental confirmation by Carver and Slichter as well as an apologetic letter from Ramsey both reached Overhauser in the same year.Purdue University Obituary of Albert W. Overhauser The so-called electron-nucleus cross-relaxation, which is responsible for the DNP phenomenon is caused by rotational and translational modulation of the electron-nucleus hyperfine coupling. The theory of this process is based essentially on the second-order time-dependent perturbation theory solution of the von Neumann equation for the spin density matrix. While the Overhauser effect relies on time-dependent electron-nuclear interactions, the remaining polarizing mechanisms rely on time-independent electron-nuclear and electron-electron interactions. The solid effect The simplest spin system exhibiting the SE DNP mechanism is an electron-nucleus spin pair. The Hamiltonian of the system can be written as: :H_0=\\\\omega_eS_z+\\\\omega_{\\\\rm n}I_z+AS_zI_z+B\\\\ S_zI_x These terms are referring respectively to the electron and nucleus Zeeman interaction with the external magnetic field, and the hyperfine interaction. S and I are the electron and nuclear spin operators in the Zeeman basis (spin ¬Ω considered for simplicity), œâe and œân are the electron and nuclear Larmor frequencies, and A and B are the secular and pseudo-secular parts of the hyperfine interaction. For simplicity we will only consider the case of |A|,|B|<<|œân|. In such a case A has little effect on the evolution of the spin system. During DNP a MW irradiation is applied at a frequency œâMW and intensity œâ1, resulting in a rotating frame Hamiltonian given by :H=\\\\Delta\\\\omega_e\\\\;S_z+\\\\omega_{\\\\rm n}I_z+AS_zI_z+B\\\\ S_zI_x+\\\\omega_1 S_xwhere \\\\Delta\\\\omega_e=\\\\omega_e-\\\\omega_{\\\\rm MW} The MW irradiation can excite the electron single quantum transitions (\\"allowed transitions\\") when œâMW is close to œâe, resulting in a loss of the electron polarization. In addition, due to the small state mixing caused by the B term of the hyperfine interaction, it is possible to irradiate on the electron-nucleus zero quantum or double quantum (\\"forbidden\\") transitions around œâMW = œâe ¬± œân, resulting in polarization transfer between the electrons and the nuclei. The effective MW irradiation on these transitions is approximately given by Bœâ1/2œân. Static sample case In a simple picture of an electron-nucleus two-spin system, the solid effect occurs when a transition involving an electron-nucleus mutual flip (called Zero Quantum or Double Quantum) is excited by a microwave irradiation, in the presence of relaxation. This kind of transition is in general weakly allowed, meaning that the transition moment for the above microwave excitation results from a second-order effect of the electron- nuclear interactions and thus requires stronger microwave power to be significant, and its intensity is decreased by an increase of the external magnetic field B0. As a result, the DNP enhancement from the solid effect scales as B0‚àí2 when all the relaxation parameters are kept constant. Once this transition is excited and the relaxation is acting, the magnetization is spread over the \\"bulk\\" nuclei (the major part of the detected nuclei in an NMR experiment) via the nuclear dipole network. This polarizing mechanism is optimal when the exciting microwave frequency shifts up or down by the nuclear Larmor frequency from the electron Larmor frequency in the discussed two-spin system. The direction of frequency shifts corresponds to the sign of DNP enhancements. Solid effect exist in most cases but is more easily observed if the linewidth of the EPR spectrum of involved unpaired electrons is smaller than the nuclear Larmor frequency of the corresponding nuclei. Magic Angle Spinning Case In the case of Magic Angle Spinning DNP (MAS-DNP), the mechanism is different but to understand it, a two spins system can still be used. The polarization process of the nucleus still occurs when the microwave irradiation excites the Double Quantum or Zero Quantum transition, but due to the fact that the sample is spinning, this condition is only met for a short time at each rotor cycle (which makes it periodical). The DNP process in that case happens step by step and not continuously as in the static case. The cross effect Static case The cross effect requires two unpaired electrons as the source of high polarization. Without special condition, such a three spins system can only generate a solid effect type of polarization. However, when the resonance frequency of each electron is separated by the nuclear Larmor frequency, and when the two electrons are dipolar coupled, another mechanism occurs: the cross-effect. In that case, the DNP process is the result of irradiation of an allowed transition (called single quantum) as a result the strength of microwave irradiation is less demanded than that in the solid effect. In practice, the correct EPR frequency separation is accomplished through random orientation of paramagnetic species with g-anisotropy. Since the \\"frequency\\" distance between the two electrons should be equal to the Larmor frequency of the targeted nucleus, Cross-Effect can only occur if the inhomogeneously broadened EPR lineshape has a linewidth broader than the nuclear Larmor frequency. Therefore, as this linewidth is proportional to external magnetic field B0, the overall DNP efficiency (or the enhancement of nuclear polarization) scales as B0‚àí1. This remains true as long as the relaxation times remain constant. Usually going to higher field leads to longer nuclear relaxation times and this may partially compensate for the line broadening reduction. In practice, in a glassy sample, the probability of having two dipolarly coupled electrons separated by the Larmor frequency is very scarce. Nonetheless this mechanism is so efficient that it can be experimentally observed alone or in addition to the Solid-Effect. Magic Angle Spinning case As in the static case, the MAS-DNP mechanism of Cross effect is deeply modified due to the time dependent energy level. By taking a simple three spin system, it has been demonstrated that the Cross-Effect mechanism is different in the Static and MAS case. The Cross Effect is the result of very fast multi-step process involving EPR single quantum transition, electron dipolar anti-crossing and Cross Effect degeneracy conditions. In the most simple case the MAS-DNP mechanism can be explained by the combination of a single quantum transition followed by the Cross-Effect degeneracy condition, or by the electron-dipolar anti-crossing followed by the Cross-Effect degeneracy condition. This in turn change dramatically the CE dependence over the static magnetic field which doesn't scale like B0‚àí1 and makes it much more efficient than the solid effect. Thermal mixing Thermal mixing is an energy exchange phenomenon between the electron spin ensemble and the nuclear spin, which can be thought of as using multiple electron spins to provide hyper-nuclear polarization. Note that the electron spin ensemble acts as a whole because of stronger inter-electron interactions. The strong interactions lead to a homogeneously broadened EPR lineshape of the involved paramagnetic species. The linewidth is optimized for polarization transfer from electrons to nuclei, when it is close to the nuclear Larmor frequency. The optimization is related to an embedded three-spin (electron- electron-nucleus) process that mutually flips the coupled three spins under the energy conservation (mainly) of the Zeeman interactions. Due to the inhomogeneous component of the associated EPR lineshape, the DNP enhancement by this mechanism also scales as B0‚àí1. DNP-NMR Enhancement Curves 1H DNP-NMR enhancement curve for cellulose char heated for several hours at 350 ¬∞C. PH \\\\- 1 is the relative polarization or intensity of the 1H signal. Many types of solid materials can exhibit more than one mechanism for DNP. Some examples are carbonaceous materials such bituminous coal and charcoal (wood or cellulose heated at high temperatures above their decomposition point which leaves a residual solid char). To separate out the mechanisms of DNP and to characterize the electron-nuclear interactions occurring in such solids a DNP enhancement curve can be made. A typical enhancement curve is obtained by measuring the maximum intensity of the NMR FID of the 1H nuclei, for example, in the presence of continuous microwave irradiation as a function of the microwave frequency offset. Carbonaceous materials such as cellulose char contain large numbers of stable free electrons delocalized in large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Such electrons can give large polarization enhancements to nearby protons via proton-proton spin-diffusion if they are not so close together that the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction does not broaden the proton resonance beyond detection. For small isolated clusters, the free electrons are fixed and give rise to solid-state enhancements (SS). The maximal proton solid-state enhancement is observed at microwave offsets of œâ ‚âà œâe ¬± œâH, where œâe and œâH are the electron and nuclear Larmor frequencies, respectively. For larger and more densely concentrated aromatic clusters, the free electrons can undergo rapid electron exchange interactions. These electrons give rise to an Overhauser enhancement centered at a microwave offset of œâe \\\\- œâH = 0. The cellulose char also exhibits electrons undergoing thermal mixing effects (TM). While the enhancement curve reveals the types electron-nuclear spin interactions in a material, it is not quantitative and the relative abundance of the different types of nuclei cannot be determined directly from the curve.

The 64th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. In a rematch of the 1946 World Series, the Cardinals won in seven games for their second championship in four years and their eighth overall. The Series was played from October 4 to 12 in Fenway Park and Busch Memorial Stadium. Background Red Sox personnel with Mayor of Boston John F. Collins (at right) in October 1967. From left: coach Bobby Doerr, infielders Dalton Jones and Rico Petrocelli, manager Dick Williams, and executive Dick O'Connell. Boston Red Sox The \\"Impossible Dream\\" Red Sox were led by triple crown winner Carl Yastrzemski (who won the Most Valuable Player award for his 1967 performance) and ace pitcher Jim Lonborg, who won the American League Cy Young Award. The Red Sox reached the World Series by emerging victorious from a dramatic four-team pennant race that revitalized interest in the team after eight straight losing seasons. Going into the last week of the season, the Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox were all within one game of each other in the standings. The White Sox lost their last five games (two to the lowly Kansas City Athletics and three to the similarly inept Washington Senators) to fall out of the race. Meanwhile, the Red Sox and Twins met in Boston for the final two games of the season, with Minnesota -- who won the AL Pennant two years earlier -- holding a one-game lead. Boston swept the Twins, but needed to wait out the result of the Tigers' doubleheader with the California Angels in Detroit. A Detroit sweep would have enabled them to tie the Red Sox for first place. The Tigers won the first game but the Angels won the nightcap, enabling the Red Sox to claim their first pennant since 1946. St. Louis Cardinals The Cardinals won 101 games en route to the National League pennant, with a team featuring All-Stars Orlando Cepeda (selected as the National League Most Valuable Player), Lou Brock, Tim McCarver, and 1964 World Series MVP Bob Gibson, as well as former two-time American League MVP Roger Maris and Curt Flood. Twenty-two-year-old Steve Carlton won 14 games in his first full major league season, beginning what was to be a lengthy and very successful career. The Cardinals overcame the absence of Bob Gibson, who missed almost one-third of the season with a broken leg on July 15 (on disabled list, July 16 ‚Äì September 6) suffered when he was struck by a ball hit by Pittsburgh's Roberto Clemente. Gibson still managed to win 13 games, and while he was out, Nelson Briles filled his spot in the rotation brilliantly, winning nine consecutive games as the Cardinals led the N.L. comfortably for most of the season, eventually winning by 10¬Ω games over the San Francisco Giants. Members of the 1967 Cardinals team in May 2017 Summary Pitching dominated this World Series, with Bob Gibson leading the Cardinals. Lonborg pitched the decisive final game of the regular season for Boston, so he was unable to start Game 1. Facing Jos√© Santiago, Gibson and St. Louis won the Series opener, 2‚Äì1. Maris (obtained from the New York Yankees in December 1966) knocked in both of St. Louis' runs with third and seventh- inning grounders. Santiago pitched brilliantly and homered in the third inning off Gibson for the Red Sox' only run. Gibson cemented his reputation as an unhittable postseason pitcher in this series, allowing only three total runs over three complete games. His efforts allowed the Cardinals to triumph despite the hitting of Yastrzemski (.500 OBP, .840 SLG), and pitching of Lonborg, who allowed only one run total in his complete-game wins in Games 2 and 5. In Game 2, Yastrzemski belted two homers but the story was Lonborg. The Boston ace retired the first 19 Cardinals he faced until he walked Curt Flood with one out in the seventh inning. He had a no-hitter until Juli√°n Javier doubled down the left field line with two out in the eighth. Lonborg settled for a one-hit shutout in which he faced only 29 batters. In St. Louis, the El Birdos (as Cepeda had nicknamed them) took Games 3 and 4, with Briles pitching the home team to a 5‚Äì2 victory (a two-run homer by Mike Shannon proved to be the decisive factor), and Gibson tossing a 6‚Äì0 whitewashing (with two RBIs apiece by Maris and McCarver). With the Cardinals leading 3 games to 1, Lonborg kept the Bosox in the series with a 3‚Äì1 victory in Game 5. The 25-year-old righthander tossed two-hit shutout ball over innings, then finally gave up a run when Maris homered to right. Fenway Park during the World Series Going for the clincher at Fenway Park in Game 6, the visiting team took a 2‚Äì1 lead going into the fourth inning when Dick Hughes (who led the National League with a .727 winning percentage and won 16 games during the regular season) gave up a record three homers in a single inning. Yastrzemski led off the inning with a long drive over the wall in left center and, two outs later, rookie Reggie Smith and Rico Petrocelli hammered consecutive shots. Brock tied the game with a two-run homer in the seventh, but Boston responded with four runs of their own in the bottom of that inning and went on for the 8‚Äì4 triumph to tie the series at three games all. The Cardinals set a World Series record using eight pitchers. The decisive Game 7 featured Gibson and Lonborg facing each other for the first time in the series, but Lonborg was starting on only two days' rest and was unable to compete with Gibson, who allowed only three hits over the course of a complete game. Going into Game 7, both pitchers were 2‚Äì0 in the series with Gibson giving up four hits in 18 innings and Lonborg surrendering a single run and four hits in his 18. Something had to give‚Äîand it was Lonborg. The Cardinal ace clearly dominated the finale, allowing only three hits, striking out 10 batters and even adding a home run blast of his own in the fifth. Javier added a three-run shot off Lonborg in the sixth and Gibson cruised to the decisive 7‚Äì2 victory. He now boasted a 5‚Äì1 record and a 2.00 ERA in two World Series, with 57 strikeouts in 54 innings and only 37 hits allowed. Matchups Game 1 Lou Brock In attendance for the opening match-up where Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, both Massachusetts natives and supporters of the Red Sox. Ace Bob Gibson (13‚Äì7, 2.98), who sat out July and August with a broken leg, started Game 1 for the Cardinals while 21-year-old Jos√© Santiago (12‚Äì4, 3.59) started for the Red Sox. Santiago, starting because Sox ace Jim Lonborg had pitched the final day of the regular season, won seven straight second-half games helping Boston stave off the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins to win the pennant by one game in a tightly fought race. Pitching was prime as Gibson and Santiago seemed to have their best stuff for this afternoon game at Fenway. The Cards got on the board in the top of the third on a leadoff single to center by Lou Brock, a double by Curt Flood, and a Roger Maris groundout to first scoring Brock from third. The Sox came right back to tie the score in the bottom of the same inning. After Bob Gibson struck out Red Sox catcher Russ Gibson, Santiago helped his own cause by homering to left center field. However, Bob Gibson was masterful the rest of the way finishing with ten strikeouts, allowing just six hits with one walk. Santiago matched Gibson until the top of the seventh when Brock again led off with a single to right (his fourth hit), promptly stole second base, and eventually scored on back-to-back groundouts by Flood and Maris. That run would hold up for a 2‚Äì1 Cardinal win, but Lonborg was waiting in the wings to start Game 2. Game 2 Carl Yastrzemski Jim Lonborg enjoyed his best season as a professional in 1967 capturing the Cy Young Award with an A.L. best 22 wins (against nine losses), was tops with 246 strikeouts, and had an impressive earned run average of 3.16. Lonborg continued his superb pitching starting Game 2 for the Red Sox and for innings, the Cardinals could only manage one baserunner, a seventh inning walk by Curt Flood. After Tim McCarver and Mike Shannon led off the eighth with groundouts, Juli√°n Javier turned a Lonborg fastball around, lining a double into the left- field corner breaking up his no-hitter. Bobby Tolan, pinch-hitting for weak- hitting Dal Maxvill, ended the inning by grounding out to second-base. Lonborg retired the side in order in the ninth ending the game as close to perfect, giving up just one hit and one walk while striking out four. Carl Yastrzemski provided more than enough offense by homering in the fourth and adding a three-run shot in the seventh (scoring Jose Tartabull and Dalton Jones.) The other Red Sox run came in the sixth inning on walks to George Scott and Reggie Smith and a sacrifice-fly by shortstop Rico Petrocelli. The final score was 5‚Äì0 to even up the series at one game apiece with an upcoming journey to St. Louis for Game 3. Game 3 Nelson Briles After \\"Sleepwalking in Boston\\", the St. Louis Cardinals came out of their hitting slumber and tagged Boston starter Gary Bell for three runs on five hits in the first two innings of Game 3. A former 16-game winner for the Cleveland Indians, Bell was an early-season pickup who pitched well in 29 games for the Sox going 12‚Äì8 with an ERA of 3.16. But he didn't have his best stuff against the Cardinals' starter, 23-year-old Nelson Briles. Briles, after losing 15 games in 1966, alternated between middle-relief and starting pitching in '67, and finished with a neat 14-win, five-loss record (.737 winning percentage‚Äîbest in the N.L.) and an even neater 2.43 ERA. The great table-setter Lou Brock started things rolling in the first with a triple to left-center. Curt Flood followed with a single to center scoring Brock for the game's first run. In the second, Tim McCarver led off with a single to center followed by a Mike Shannon home run to left. Ineffective Gary Bell was pinch-hit for in the third inning, replaced by Gary Waslewski. Waslewski pitched three perfect innings, striking out three before leaving in the sixth for relief pitcher Lee Stange. Boston scored their first run in the sixth with Mike Andrews, (pinch-hitting for Bell), singling to center. Andrews took second on a Tartabull sacrifice, immediately scoring on a Dalton Jones base hit to right. But the Cards added some insurance in the bottom of the frame with the disconcerting Brock bunting for a hit, eventually going to third when Stange, attempting a pick-off, threw wild into right- field. Roger Maris, in his next-to-last season, would have a good Series with ten hits and a home run, scored Brock with a single to right-center. In the seventh Reggie Smith hit a lead-off home run for Boston, trimming the score to 4‚Äì2 but the Cards stifled any further Sox comeback scoring their fifth run in the bottom of the eighth when Maris beat out an infield tap for a single and Orlando Cepeda muscled a double off the wall in right-center making the score 5‚Äì2. Briles would finish his complete-game victory with a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 ninth, the second out recorded when Reggie Smith would interfere with McCarver who was trying to catch his pop-up foul down the first-base line. Up two games to one, St. Louis would send Bob Gibson back to the mound, a championship within reach. Game 4 Curt Flood 54,000 plus fans packed Busch Memorial Stadium in anticipation of yet another Bob Gibson post-season, pitching gem. Again, all St. Louis needed was a spark from Lou Brock and this time four runs crossed the plate in the first inning. Brock started things rolling with a slow-roller to third‚Äînothing Dalton Jones could do could match Brock's speed, for an infield-hit. Curt Flood singled to shallow left and Roger Maris powered-up going the other way, doubling into the left-field corner scoring both base-runners. Orlando Cepeda then flied out, Maris advancing to third. Tim McCarver hit a clutch single to right to score Maris. After Mike Shannon fouled out to Rico Petrocelli for the second out, Juli√°n Javier would single in the hole between short and third followed by .217 lifetime hitter Dal Maxvill's run-scoring single to left for the Cardinals' fourth run. That would be it for Game 1 starter Jos√© Santiago who would only last two-thirds of an inning this time out. Gary Bell would relieve, getting the ninth batter of the inning, Bob Gibson to fly out to left. Gibson would be on cruise-control the remainder of the game while the Cards would add two more runs off reliever Jerry Stephenson in the third. Cepeda would double into the left-field corner and move to third on a wild pitch. McCarver would add a second RBI on a sac- fly to center scoring Cepeda. Shannon would walk and score on a Juli√°n Javier double just inside the third-base line. That would be it for the scoring as Gibson would win his second Series game, a five-hit complete-game that put his Cardinals up, three games to one. Game 5 Jim Lonborg With their backs up against the wall, manager Dick Williams again put his trust in the dependable Jim Lonborg. The 25-year-old righty was faced by Steve \\"Lefty\\" Carlton. Carlton was 14‚Äì9 in 30 games with a 2.98 ERA, striking out 168 in 193 innings during the regular season. The game played out very tentatively, with just one early run scored by Boston in the top of the third. After Lonborg struck out leading off the inning, Joe Foy struck a single to left field. Mike Andrews reached safely at first after a sacrifice attempt was fumbled by Cardinal third-baseman Mike Shannon for an error. With two on and one out, team hero Carl Yastrzemski looked at a third strike for the second out, but Ken Harrelson followed with a clutch single to left, scoring Foy. This would be enough to saddle Carlton with the loss. Pitching with a slight cold (and a paper horseshoe in his back pocket) Lonborg again sparkled, at one point retiring 12 straight. After a Roger Maris single in the fourth, the next batter to reach base was Juli√°n Javier, who got on base in the eighth on an error by Rico Petrocelli. Carlton was just as good but left after six innings of work and would take the loss despite having no earned runs (the run in the third was unearned). He was replaced by Ray Washburn, who then pitched two scoreless innings. St. Louis Manager Red Schoendienst brought in Ron Willis to pitch the ninth. The Red Sox greeted Willis by loading the bases on a George Scott walk, a Reggie Smith double, and an intentional walk to Petrocelli. Jack Lamabe relieved Willis after a 1‚Äì0 count on Elston Howard who promptly popped a single to right scoring Scott. Maris threw high to the plate, allowing Smith to score the second run. With the score 3‚Äì0, St. Louis came to bat in the last of the ninth in a last attempt comeback bid. But Lonborg's luck continued, getting Brock and Flood to ground out to second and third respectively. Maris spoiled the shutout bid by homering over the right-field fence but Orlando Cepeda ended the game on a ground-out to third. The Red Sox were now back in the Series, although still down three games to two. Game 6 Rico Petrocelli Pivotal Game 6 matched rookie Gary Waslewski (2‚Äì2, 3.21) who had only pitched in 12 regular season games, versus one-year wonder Dick Hughes (16‚Äì6, 2.67) who pitched three seasons, winning only twice more in 1968 before retiring due to arm problems. Rico Petrocelli gave the Red Sox an early lead with a second inning blast over the Green Monster in left field. St. Louis came back with two runs in the top of the third when Juli√°n Javier hit a lead- off double off that same Green Monster. After retiring the next two batters, Waslewski gave up a single to Lou Brock, scoring Javier. Then after a Brock steal, Curt Flood singled to left, scoring Brock. In the Sox half of the fourth, Carl Yastrzemski, Reggie Smith, and Rico Petrocelli would all go long setting a new World Series record with three home runs in the same inning. A demoralized Hughes wouldn't finish the inning and Ron Willis would be summoned from the bullpen to get the last out, an Elston Howard groundout to third. Waslewski was very workmanlike, but started to tire in the sixth inning when, after giving up two walks, was replaced by John Wyatt who would get out of the jam retiring Mike Shannon on a popup to short and Javier on a fly to short right. The Cards would come back and hit Wyatt hard in the seventh. After pinch-hitter Bobby Tolan walked, Lou Brock hit a homer into the right-center field bleachers. Flood and Maris hit long fly-outs to center but their hits stayed in the park to end the inning, St. Louis had tied the score at four apiece. The Red Sox would send ten batters to the plate in the bottom of the seventh inning and regain the lead. Elston Howard would lead off making both the first and last outs but four runs would cross the plate in-between. After all was said and done, the Cardinals would send four pitchers to the mound in the inning and when Hal Woodeshick would come into pitch the eighth, a Series record would be tied with eight (8) pitchers used also setting a two team record of 11 pitchers used. St. Louis had one more good chance to win the game loading the bases in the eighth, but highlighted by a great Yastrzemski catch in left-center, the Cards couldn't push one across and wouldn't score again going quietly in the ninth; with Gary Bell pitching the last two innings for the save. The Red Sox survived to play another day and the Series was now tied at three games apiece. Wyatt took the win and Jack Lamabe, who was the first pitcher for the Cardinals in the eighth, would be given the loss. Game 7 Bob Gibson The seventh game finally matched up the aces, Bob Gibson against Jim Lonborg. Lonborg was pitching on two-days rest, while Gibson had rested an extra day since his last outing. Only once before had a seventh game of a Series brought together starting pitchers who both had 2‚Äì0 records in the Series‚Äîin 1925, when the Washington Senators' Walter Johnson pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates' Vic Aldridge. St. Louis catcher Tim McCarver said the Boston newspapers made the Cardinals angry with their headline \\"Lonborg and Champagne\\" that basically declared before Game 7 that Lonborg would win. From the start, it was apparent that Lonborg was struggling. Three Cardinal hits and a wild pitch put St. Louis ahead 2‚Äì0 in the third inning. Two more scored in the fifth on a home run by Gibson, Lou Brock's single and two stolen bases (his seventh steal‚Äîa new Series record), and a Roger Maris sacrifice-fly to right. A Boston run in the fifth cut the score to 4‚Äì1, but the Red Sox dream was abruptly halted in the sixth on a three-run homer by Juli√°n Javier off the arm-weary Lonborg. With the 7‚Äì2 defeat, Boston's \\"Impossible Dream\\" ended one win short, and the St. Louis Cardinals were World Series Champions for the second time in the 1960s, and eighth overall. Composite box 1967 World Series (4‚Äì3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Boston Red Sox (A.L.) Records and notables * This series marked the first time that the Commissioner's Trophy was presented to the World Series-winning team. * Lou Brock stole three bases in Game 7 for a record seven thefts in a seven-game series. * The Cardinals tied a World Series record by using eight pitchers in their Game 6 loss. * Ken Brett, the older brother of George Brett, became the youngest pitcher in World Series history. Aged 19 years, 20 days, when he pitched one inning of relief at the end of Game 4. He also pitched of an inning at the end of Game 7. He gave up no hits or runs in either appearance. He was the only left-hander on the Boston pitching staff. * Bob Gibson gave up only 14 hits in his three complete games, tying Christy Mathewson's record for fewest hits given up in winning three complete World Series games. * The Cardinals are one of only two teams to take a 3‚Äì1 World Series lead, then lose the next two games and still win the series in Game 7. The other was the Oakland Athletics in their victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the 1972 World Series. Aftermath The 1967 Series was the first non-exhibition meeting between Major League Baseball teams from St. Louis and Boston since the departures of the Boston Braves and St. Louis Browns following (respectively) the 1952 and 1953 seasons ended regular season meetings between teams from those cities (Braves vs Cardinals, Browns vs Red Sox). It also marked the last time that a St. Louis-based team defeated a Boston-based team in the championship round of any professional sport until 2019 when the St. Louis Blues defeated the Boston Bruins 4 games to 3 in the Stanley Cup Finals. In the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals the Bruins swept the Blues with Bobby Orr scoring the memorable series-winning goal in overtime in Game 4. The New England Patriots followed suit by defeating the St. Louis Rams' \\"Greatest Show on Turf\\" team 20-17 in Super Bowl XXXVI after the 2001 NFL season, with kicker Adam Vinatieri scoring the game- winning field goal on the final play. In the 2004 World Series, the Red Sox swept the Cardinals in four to break the Curse of the Bambino, then bested them again in six games nine years later. In the NBA Finals, the Boston Celtics and St. Louis Hawks met four times in five years, with the Celtics winning in 1957, 1960 and 1961 and the Hawks winning in 1958. (The Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968.) This was the first year since 1948 that neither the Yankees, nor the Giants, nor the Dodgers played in the World Series. It would be another seven years before the Dodgers would return to the series and nine before the Yankees came back. The Giants would not play again in a World Series until . This was the Cardinals' first World Series that was not played in Sportsman's Park, which had closed partway through the 1966 season. It was the first of six played in Busch Memorial Stadium, also known as Busch Stadium II, which opened in 1966 to replace Sportsman's Park (which had been renamed Busch Stadium in 1953).

She was designed as an armored ram for service in shallow waters, but also carried three guns. The ship was built in Bordeaux, France, for the Confederate States Navy under the cover name Sphinx, but was sold to Denmark after sales of warships by French builders to the Confederacy was forbidden in 1863. The Danes refused to accept the ship and sold her to the Confederates which commissioned her as CSS Stonewall in 1865. The ship did not reach Confederate waters before the end of the American Civil War in April and was turned over to the United States. The Tokugawa shogunate of Japan bought her from the United States in 1867 and renamed her K≈çtetsu, but delivery was held up by the Americans until after the Imperial faction had established control over most of the country. She was finally delivered in March 1869 and had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the completion of the military phase of the Meiji Restoration. Renamed Azuma in 1871, she played minor roles in the Saga rebellion and the Taiwan Expedition, both in 1874. The ship ran aground later that year, but was refloated and repaired. During the Satsuma Rebellion three years later, she was little used. Azuma was stricken in 1888 and was sold for scrap the following year. Description Sphinx was long between perpendiculars and had an overall length of including her prominent pointed naval ram. The ship had a beam of and a draught of . The brig's composite hull was sheathed in copper to protect it from parasites and biofouling and it featured a pronounced tumblehome. She displaced and her crew numbered 135 officers and crewmen. To improve her maneuverability the ship was fitted with twin rudders.Canney, pp. 113‚Äì114; Silverstone, p. 150 Her main battery consisted of a single 300-pounder () Armstrong rifled muzzle-loading (RML) gun located in the bow turret in a pivot mount. The fixed turret had three or five gun ports. A pair of 70-pounder () Armstrong RML guns were positioned in the oval fixed turret abaft the mainmast, one pivot mount on each broadside firing through two gun ports. The Japanese removed one of the 70-pounder guns and added a pair of Armstrong 6-pounder guns, four 4-pounder field guns and a Gatling gun. The ship was designed to withstand hits by guns. Her hull was protected by a wrought-iron armored belt that extended below the waterline that was backed by about 15 inches of teak. The hull armor was amidships and tapered to towards the bow and stern. Above it was a strake of armor thick.Lengerer, p. 118 The bow turret was protected with armor and the amidships turret was fitted with armor plates. The power plant consisted of a pair of Mazeline horizontal two-cylinder single-expansion steam engines, each driving a four-bladed, screw using steam provided by two Mazeline tubular boilers. The engines were rated at a total of . The ship reached a maximum speed of during her sea trials on 9 October 1864. She had an estimated range of with a full load of of coal.Lengerer, p. 119 Origins and career CSS Stonewall in the Washington Navy Yard, 1865 In June 1863 John Slidell, the Confederate commissioner to France, asked Emperor Napoleon III in a private audience if it would be possible for the Confederate government to build ironclad warships in France. Arming ships of war for a recognized belligerent like the Confederate States would have been illegal under French law, but Slidell and his agent, James D. Bulloch, were confident that the Emperor of France would be able to circumvent his own laws more easily than other potential secret contractors. Napoleon III agreed to the building of ironclads in France on the condition that their destination remain a secret.Case & Spencer, pp. 429‚Äì433 The following month Bulloch entered a contract with Lucien Arman, a French shipbuilder and a personal confidant of Napoleon III, to build a pair of ironclad rams capable of breaking the Union blockade. To avoid suspicion, the ships' guns were manufactured separately from the ship herself and the pair were named Cheops and Sphinx to encourage rumors that they were intended for the Egyptian Navy.Case & Spencer, pp. 435‚Äì439 Prior to delivery, however, a shipyard clerk walked into the U.S. Minister's office in Paris and produced documents which revealed that Arman had fraudulently obtained authorization to arm the ships and was in contact with Confederate agents.Case & Spencer, pp. 437‚Äì439 The French government blocked the sale under pressure from the United States, but Arman was able to sell the ships to Denmark and Prussia, which were then fighting on opposite sides of the Second Schleswig War. Cheops was sold to Prussia as , while Sphinx was sold to Denmark under the name St√¶rkodder on 31 March 1864. Manned by a Danish crew, the ship left Bordeaux for its shakedown cruise on 21 June 1864. The crew tested the vessel while final negotiations were being conducted between the Danish Naval Ministry and Arman. Intense haggling over the final price and a disagreement over compensation from the company for cited problems and late delivery led to negotiations breaking down on 30 October, although the ship had set sail for Copenhagen, Denmark, on 25 October. The Danish government refused to relinquish the vessel, claiming confusion in regards to the negotiations. She arrived in Copenhagen on 10 November and was in the dockyard at the beginning of 1865.Steensen. An English translation by S√∏ren N√∏rby may be found at http://milhist.dk/vabnet/the-armoured-ram-staerkodder/ American career View of bow Closeup At the beginning of 1865 the Danes sold the ship to the Confederacy. On 6 January the vessel took aboard a Confederate States Navy crew at Copenhagen under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Jefferson Page,Scharf, p. 805 although the ship was still commanded by a Danish captain when she put to sea the following day. Heavy weather forced the ship to take refuge at Elsinore, but she set sail shortly afterward for the French coast where she loaded supplies, ammunition and more crewmen. During this time she was commissioned CSS Stonewall while still at sea and Page assumed command of the ship. High seas in the Bay of Biscay damaged her rudders while en route for the island of Madeira, Portugal, and forced the ship to seek refuge in Ferrol, Spain. Permanent repairs took several months and provided time for the Union to be notified of the ship's location.Canney, p. 115Stonewall In February and March, the Union steam frigate and steam sloop kept watch from a distance as Stonewall lay anchored off A Coru√±a, waiting for Stonewall to finish her repairs. On 24 March Page put to sea, prepared to engage them, but the unarmored Union ships declined to fight. Stonewall steamed for Lisbon, Portugal, to re-coal, intending to cross the Atlantic Ocean from there. Stonewall reached Nassau, Bahamas, on 6 May and then sailed on to Havana, Cuba, where Page learned of the war's end when he arrived five days later.Scharf, pp. 805‚Äì806 Union ships first arrived at Havana on 15 May and were reinforced over the course of the month, to include the monitors and .United States, Official Records, pp. 520, 535 Page decided to turn Stonewall over to the Spanish Captain General of Cuba for the sum of $16,000 to pay the crew's wages.Scharf, p. 806 The vessel would then turned over to United States representatives in return for reimbursement of the same amount. The Americans did not pay until 2 November and Stonewall required some repairs before she could put to sea again. Escorted by the paddle steamers and , the ironclad departed Havana on 15 November and arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on 24 November. While sailing through Chesapeake Bay on the night of 22/23 November, Stonewall accidentally rammed and sank a coal schooner off Smith Island, Maryland; no lives were lost.United States, Official Records, pp. 566, 597‚Äì598, 600‚Äì602 She was subsequently paid off and laid up at the Washington Navy Yard. Japanese career Seeking to reinforce its fleet with modern warships, the Tokugawa shogunate sent representatives to the United States in 1867, seeking to purchase surplus ships. Acting envoy to the United States Ono Tomogoro discovered Stonewall in the Washington Navy Yard in May and made a formal offer to the United States government for the purchase of the ironclad. The purchase was concluded for the price of $400,000 and she was turned over to the Japanese on 5 August who renamed her K≈çtetsu.Letter from Susumu Nishiura, Staff-in-Chief, War History Room, Ministry of Defense, Japan, to Faith Kravitz, Eleutherian Mills, Hagley Museum, Delaware, USA dated Sept. 25, 1965, available at https://archive.org/details/KravitzNishiuraLtrJapanese/ However, by the time of her arrival in Shinagawa harbor on 22 January 1868, the Boshin War between the shogunate and pro-Imperial forces had begun, and the United States took a neutral stance, stopping the delivery of military material, including the delivery of K≈çtetsu, to the Shogunate. The ship had arrived under a Japanese flag with an American crew, but US Resident-Minister Robert B. Van Valkenburg ordered her put back under the American flag. K≈çtetsu was finally delivered to the new Meiji government in early March 1869. Boshin War K≈çtetsu leading the line of battle, at the Naval Battle of Hakodate Before K≈çtetsu was turned over to the Japanese, Tokugawa admiral Enomoto Takeaki refused to surrender his warships after the surrender of Edo Castle to the new government, and escaped to Hakodate in Hokkaido with the remainder of the Tokugawa Navy and a handful of French military advisers and their leader Jules Brunet. His fleet of eight steam warships was the strongest in Japan at the time. On 27 January 1869, Tokugawa loyalists declared the foundation of the Republic of Ezo and elected Enomoto as president. The Meiji government refused to accept partition of Japan and dispatched its newly formed Imperial Japanese Navy, which consisted of K≈çtetsu as the flagship and a collection of various steam-powered warships that had been contributed by the various feudal domains loyal to the new government. On 25 March 1869, during the Battle of Miyako Bay, K≈çtetsu successfully repulsed a surprise night attempt at naval boarding by the rebel (spearheaded by survivors from the Shinsengumi), making use of a mounted Gatling gun. K≈çtetsu subsequently supported the invasion of Hokkaid≈ç and various naval engagements in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay.Ballard, pp. 121‚Äì123Greene & Massignani, pp. 346‚Äì349 Subsequent career Following the end of the Boshin War in August 1870, K≈çtetsu was classified as a third-class warship on 15 November 1871 and was renamed Azuma on 7 December. By January 1873, her fighting ability was assessed as low. Azuma was assigned to guard Nagasaki during the Saga rebellion in February 1874 and during the Taiwan Expedition of May 1874. On 19 August she ran aground at Kagoshima during a typhoon, but was refloated and repaired at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. During the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, she was assigned to guard duties in the Seto Inland Sea. She was stricken from the navy list on 28 January 1888, and was sold for scrap on 12 December 1889. Her armor plating was reused to make the armature shafts in the electric generators in the Asakusa Thermal Power Station, built in Tokyo in 1895.

From 1805 to 1807, he served in the Napoleonic wars, and was present at the battles of Pu≈Çtusk and Friedland. From 1809 to 1811 he participated in the Russo-Turkish War. He commanded the composite grenadiers division in Prince Petr Bagration's Second Western Army during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. At the battle of Borodino, his division was in the front line and was attacked by three French divisions under Marshal Davout. Of the 4,000 men in his division, only 300 survived the battle. Vorontsov was wounded but recovered to rejoin the army in 1813. He commanded a new grenadiers division and fought at the battle of Dennewitz and the battle of Leipzig. He was the commander of the corps of occupation in France from 1815 to 1818. Elizabeth Branicka Vorontsov, by George Hayter On 7 May 1823 he was appointed governor-general of New Russia, as the southern provinces of the empire were then called, and namestnik of Bessarabia. In the year of the start of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, Vorontsov succeeded the wounded Menshikov as commander of the forces besieging Varna, which he captured on 28 September 1828. It was through his energetic efforts that the plague, which had broken out in Turkey, did not penetrate into Russia. His Polish wife, n√©e Countess Branicka, had a liaison with Alexander Pushkin during her stay in Odessa, which resulted in some of the finest poems in the Russian language. In 1844, Vorontsov was appointed commander-in-chief and viceroy of the Caucasus. For military details see Murid War. At the battle of Dargo (1845), he was nearly defeated and barely fought his way out of the Chechen forest. By 1848 he had captured two-thirds of Dagestan, and the situation of the Russians in the Caucasus, so long almost desperate, was steadily improving. For his campaign against Shamil, and for his difficult march through the dangerous forests of Ichkeria, he was raised to the dignity of prince, with the title of Serene Highness. In the beginning of 1853, Vorontsov was allowed to retire because of his increasing infirmities. He was made a field-marshal in 1856, and died the same year at Odessa. His archives were published, in 40 volumes, by Pyotr Bartenev between 1870 and 1897. Vorontsov's Moorish Castle in Alupka, Crimea (1828‚Äì46) A statue of Prince Vorontsov was unveiled in Odessa in 1863. In front of the monument stands the Transfiguration Cathedral with the marble tombs of Prince Vorontsov and his wife. After the Soviets demolished the cathedral in 1936, Vorontsov's remains were secretly reburied in a local cemetery. The cathedral was rebuilt in the early 2000s. The remains of Vorontsov and his wife were solemnly transferred to the church in 2005. Notes References Gammer, Moshe.

He is arguably most known as the author of In Defense of Global Capitalism (2001) and Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future (2016). Since 15 March 2007 he has been a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, and since January 2017 an executive editor at Free To Choose Media, where he regularly produces documentaries for US public television.  Early life and education  Johan Norberg was born in Stockholm, the son of former Swedish National Archivist Erik Norberg and his wife Birgitta. He grew up in the suburb of H√§sselby in western Stockholm. In his youth, Norberg was active as a left-anarchist but later abandoned those views and became a classical liberal. According to the biography given at his personal website, Norberg was disillusioned with the anarchist view of liberty when he discovered the collectivist themes in the major anarchist works, and was unable to sympathize with the pre-industrial society which its anarcho- primitivism promoted. This realization made him embrace classical liberalism, which he felt \\"took freedom seriously.\\" He studied at Stockholm University from 1992 to 1999 and earned a M.A. with a major in the history of ideas. His other subjects included philosophy, literature and political science. During his time at Stockholm University he was active in the libertarian network Frihetsfronten (\\"the Liberty Front\\") and was the editor of its journal Nyliberalen (\\"The Neoliberal\\"/\\"The Libertarian\\") from 1993 to 1997.  Career  Norberg presenting himself at the Gothenburg bookfair 2012. In 1997, Norberg was contacted by the Swedish liberal think tank Timbro, who invited him to write a book about the Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg. The book, Motst√•ndsmannen Vilhelm Moberg, sold well and sparked much debate which allowed him to write another book, on the history of Swedish liberalism. This book, Den svenska liberalismens historia, also became a success and in 1999 Norberg joined the permanent staff of Timbro. From 1999 to 2002 he was assistant editor-in-chief of the webzine Smedjan.com. In 1999 he started the website Frihandel.nu to put forward the case for free trade and open economies. Having participated in a number of debates against the Swedish anti-globalization movement, in May 2001 he released the book In Defense of Global Capitalism () where he assembles his arguments for globalization and free trade. In 2002 the book was selected for the Sir Antony Fisher International Memorial Award by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation and in 2003 Norberg was awarded the gold medal of the German Hayek Stiftung (an award shared with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the German economist Otmar Issing). The British Channel 4 also invited him to present the documentary film Globalisation is Good (released in 2003), which is based on his book. From 2002 to 2005, Norberg was head of political ideas at Timbro. From 2006 to 2007 he was a Senior Fellow with the Brussels-based think tank Centre for the New Europe. Since 15 March 2007 he has been a Senior Fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute. He is also a member of the international Mont Pelerin Society. In January 2017 Norberg became Executive Editor of Free To Choose Media.

It originally consisted of Robert Poss (guitar/vocals), Susan Stenger (bass/vocals), Ron Spitzer (drums), with Susan Lyall (guitar), Susan Tallman (guitar), and Alva Rogers (vocals). The band would undergo several permutations over the years, usually involving three guitarists. Poss, Stenger, and Spitzer were the band's core members throughout its duration. They originated in the New York noise rock scene, but due to their layered guitar sound were sometimes seen as the American counterparts to the UK shoegazing bands and also drew influence from modern experimental composers Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca. History In the early to mid-1980s, Poss studied under the tutelage of avant-garde guitar ensemble composer Rhys Chatham, and played in the bands Tot Rocket and Western Eyes. The band was formed by avant-garde flautist Susan Stenger and guitarist Robert Poss, they took their name from the trio of Susans then in the lineup. Poss, Stenger, and Spitzer grew up together in Buffalo, New York. Band of Susans released the 12\\" EP Blessing And Curse on Poss's own Trace Elements label. A record-release party (also said to be the band's first-ever live gig) was held at NYC's The Love Club on January 31, 1987; BoS were the opening act for a band called Das Furlines. They were soon signed to the avant-garde Blast First imprint of UK record label Mute Records. After the release of d√©but album Hope Against Hope, Rogers, Lyall and Tallman quit, and were replaced by Karen Haglof (guitar) and Page Hamilton (guitar). This lineup recorded the album Love Agenda and a Peel Sessions EP, which featured a cover of Gang Of Four's \\"I Found That Essence Rare.\\" The two new guitarists then quit, with Hamilton quickly forming the more metal-influenced Helmet. Anne Husick (guitar) and Mark Lonergan (guitar) then joined BoS, yielding the band's \\"classic lineup\\" which made three more albums and one EP, all on Restless Records. According to The Great Indie Discography compilation, \\"...unfortunately, success is the one thing that has eluded the Band of Susans and Co. throughout their decade-plus lifespan.\\" Sonic characteristics Band of Susans was a \\"rock band without the rock clich√©s ... each instrument was given its own part, and they fitted together like building blocks to create droning, dense textures.\\" As their history of having eight guitarists in all (and never less than three at any given time) attests, Band of Susans were a heavily guitar-centric outfit. They are generally included in New York City's abrasive post-No Wave scene which produced Sonic Youth, Glenn Branca, Live Skull, and Swans. They generally used G&L; brand guitars (which appear on several of the band's album covers), Fender Jazzmasters, and Park (a budget brand made by Marshall) amplifiers. G&L; owner Leo Fender was a fan of the band and later befriended Poss. Musically, the band organised their three guitarists into providing an overwhelming wall of feedback and guitar noise layered atop more conventional song structures. Due to their focus on atmospheric textures, the band is often considered a peripheral member of the shoegaze movement, though they had a more abrasive sound closer to that of their New York contemporaries than most of the primarily-British bands of the shoegaze genre. Like shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Band of Susans were notorious for playing live at extremely high volumes in order to recreate the visceral impact of their studio albums. In an interview, guitarist Robert Poss noted the similarity between shoegaze and Band of Susan's hypnotic soundscape, saying \\"My Bloody Valentine have been contemporaries of ours, and we played shows with them in Europe and in the U.S. in 1989.\\" Despite the band's experimental leanings, Poss was a big fan of The Rolling Stones, which would later manifest in covers of the Stones' songs \\"Child Of The Moon\\" and \\"Paint It, Black\\" Live performances Band of Susans toured the U.S. and Europe sporadically. They played with bands such as Live Skull, My Bloody Valentine, Butthole Surfers, Wire, Rollins Band, Smegma, Das Furlines, and Lovely. During the band's final U.S. and European tours, Jay Braun (who formed the Negatones shortly thereafter) filled in for Lonergan and Kelly Burns filled in for Ron Spitzer. Band of Susans also performed, with Rhys Chatham as a warmup \\"group,\\" at \\"The Kitchen\\" on 19th Street, in the early 1980s as part of a \\"performance art\\" piece. Afterward, they performed at CBGB, although not with their original lineup, with the exception of Susan Stenger, Robert Poss, and possibly Karen Hagloff. Forgotten drummer during the 1991 European and American support tour for the band's release, \\"Word and the Flesh \\" was New Jersey based drummer, Joseph Kochan, who performed as \\"Joey Kaye \\" . Post-breakup After the dissolution of the band in late 1996, Poss and Stenger performed with Bruce Gilbert of Wire as gilbertpossstenger; one album was released under this moniker. Stenger and Poss have also worked extensively with composer Phill Niblock. Poss has concentrated on production and solo work, whilst Stenger played live with The Creatures for a period, and worked with Nick Cave, John Cale and Alan Vega (Suicide) among others.

A member of the Democratic Party from Illinois, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1903 to 1921 and from 1923 to his death. He rose to Speaker of the House, during the famous Hundred days of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Biography Early years Rainey attended the public schools and Knox Academy and Knox College, Galesburg, Ill. He transferred to, and graduated from Amherst College in 1883 and then the Union College of Law, in Chicago which he graduated in 1885. He was admitted to the bar in 1885 and commenced practice in Carrollton, Ill. Political career Rainey was appointed master in chancery for Greene County, Ill., from 1887 until 1895, when he resigned, and returned to private practice. He then decided to return to politics in 1902 getting elected to Congress and serving for nine terms before losing to Guy L. Shaw in 1920. Two years later, he won back his seat and served until his death. Leadership Due to the Great Depression, the Republican party lost its majority in a landslide, and, with John Nance Garner elevated to the Speakership, Rainey ran for, and defeated John McDuffie for the Majority leadership. McDuffie remained as Whip. Speaker of the House Statue of Henry T. Rainey, north of Carrollton, Illinois With Speaker Garner having been inaugurated Vice President on March 4, 1933, Rainey, being next in line, was elected Speaker of the House when President Roosevelt called a special session of Congress two days later. Rainey gave the Roosevelt administration carte blanche to do whatever it wanted, allowing almost the entire New Deal to be passed with little or no changes. More reforms were passed during the regular session starting December. Rainey died of a heart attack the following summer, on the eve of his seventy-fourth birthday, before the new Congress could meet. See also *Henry T.

Construction and career United States Navy Named for Stanton Frederick Kalk, Kalk, laid down as Rodgers 17 August 1918. The ship was launched on 21 December 1918, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Flora Stanton Kalk, mother of Lieutenant Kalk. Rodgers was renamed Kalk on 23 December 1918 and commissioned at Boston on 29 March 1919, Lieutenant Commander N. R. Van der Veer in command. After shakedown off Newport, Rhode Island, Kalk departed Boston on 3 May for Newfoundland. Arriving at Trespassey on 5 May, she sailed 3 days later for the mid-Atlantic to provide rescue cover during the pioneer flight of the United States Navy seaplane NC-4 from Newfoundland to the Azores on 16 to 17 May. After returning to Boston on 20 May, she sailed for Europe on 10 July, arriving at Brest, France, 21 July. Proceeding via England to Hamburg, Germany, she arrived on 27 July to begin a 3-week cruise through the Baltic Sea, visiting Baltic and Scandinavian countries on American Relief Administration operations. She returned to Brest on 23 August to serve as a dispatch and escort ship until departing for the United States 25 January 1920. Arriving at Boston on 12 February, she trained reserves of the 1st Naval District and operated with DesRon 3 along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to Charleston, South Carolina. As a result of the Five Power Naval Treaty, which was signed at the Washington Conference 6 February 1922, Kalk departed Boston 10 May for Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 10 July and was placed in reserve. When war in Europe threatened the security of the entire world, Kalk was recommissioned on 17 June 1940, Lt. T. P. Elliott in command. The ship departed Philadelphia on 26 July, arriving at Charleston on 31 July for duty with the Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic. Kalk was one of 50 overage destroyers turned over to Britain in exchange for strategic bases in the Atlantic under terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement of 2 September. She cleared Charleston on 7 September and steamed via Hampton Roads and Newport to Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving on 18 September. Kalk decommissioned on 23 September and was turned over to the British the same day. Royal Navy Commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Hamilton, which was a placename common to both the UK and US, she collided with (formerly the US destroyer Maddox) at St. John's, Newfoundland on 1 October while en route to England. Proceeding to Saint John, New Brunswick, for repairs, she went aground and suffered extensive damage. Because of a British manpower shortage, she was manned by Canadians during and after repair operations. Hamilton was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\\"/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog anti-submarine weapon.Lenton&Colledge; (1968) p.91 Royal Canadian Navy Late in June 1941 she commissioned in the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Hamilton fitting within the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian riversMilner 1985 p.23‚Äîthe Hamilton River of Labrador. Throughout her active service, she remained in North American waters, protecting convoys from St. John's to New York. On 2 August 1942, she sighted and attacked a German U-boat and, by forcing it to submerge, prevented an attack on the convoy. Declared unfit for operations 11 August 1943, she became a tender to at Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Declared surplus 1 April 1945, she decommissioned 8 June at Sydney, Nova Scotia. Hamilton departed Sydney 6 July under tow for Baltimore, Maryland, where she was sold for scrapping by the Boston Iron & Metal Company, but was lost while being towed to Baltimore.

He spent 36 seasons overall with the Indians, as a player from 1928 to 1947 and as one of the game's most highly regarded pitching coaches from 1948 to 1963. He set franchise records for wins (223), games started (433) and innings pitched (3426) which were later broken by Bob Feller, and still holds the club record of 582 career games pitched; he was among the American League's career leaders in wins (9th), games (8th) and starts (10th) when he retired. He was also an excellent fielder, leading AL pitchers in putouts four times, then a record. Career Harder was born in Beemer, Nebraska, and graduated from Tech High School in North Omaha, Nebraska. He broke in with the Indians as a relief pitcher in . His pitching style revolved around his fine curveball, a hard fastball and excellent control. He joined the starting rotation in 1930, and posted a record of 39‚Äì37 from 1930 to 1932; on July 31, , he pitched the first game ever at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. In he finished second in the AL with an earned run average of 2.95, trailing teammate Monte Pearson (2.33); under modern rules (one inning pitched per games played by team), enacted in 1951, Harder would have been credited with the league lead, as Pearson only pitched 135 innings. In he finished with 20 wins, led the league with six shutouts, and was again second in ERA (2.61) to Lefty G√≥mez. In he was second to Wes Ferrell in wins (22) and innings (287), and was fifth in the AL with a 3.29 ERA. After developing a sore elbow and bursitis in his shoulder, he won at least 15 games each season from 1936 to 1939; he led AL pitchers in putouts in 1932, 1933, 1935 and . Harder was one of the most successful All-Stars of the 1930s, appearing in all four games from 1934 to 1937, and setting a record with 13 consecutive innings without an earned run. He won the 1934 All-Star game after relieving Red Ruffing with none out and two men on in the fifth inning, with an 8‚Äì6 lead; one run scored on a double steal, but Harder allowed only one hit in his five innings as the AL won 9‚Äì7. He earned a save in the 1935 game, pitching three scoreless innings to finish a 4‚Äì1 victory, and another in with three shutout innings in the 8‚Äì3 win; he also finished the 4‚Äì3 loss played at Cleveland in with two innings. In 1940, he posted a 12‚Äì11 record, as the Indians finished one game behind the pennant-winning Detroit Tigers, wasting an early September lead amid clubhouse rancor; it would be the only season in his career in which the Indians came within ten games of the AL flag. After several more years in which his record hovered near .500, earning his 200th victory in , Harder ended his career in with 1160 strikeouts and a 3.80 ERA. In addition to his 223 victories, his 186 losses remain a club record. Ironically, the Indians won the World Series the year after he retired. From 1948 into the 1950s, he guided what became known as the Indians' \\"Big Four\\" pitching rotation, featuring Feller, Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Mike Garcia; Harder had successfully transformed Lemon from an infielder into a top pitcher while working with him in the mid-1940s, and he taught future 300 game-winner Wynn the breaking ball and changeup. Wynn had had a losing record (72-87) before being traded to the Indians by the Washington Senators.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wynnea01.shtml In 1953, Lemon tied Harder's record by leading AL pitchers in putouts for the fourth time, and he broke the record the following year as the Indians won another pennant, but lost to the underdog New York Giants in the World Series. Herb Score was named the AL's Rookie of the Year in after Harder helped to develop his curveball. When Sal Maglie was struggling with the Indians, Harder watched some films of Maglie pitching with the Giants and figured out that he wasn't swivelling his foot like he normally did, which kept him from following through with his delivery. \\"As soon as I went back to the old way, everything was all right,\\" Maglie said. During his coaching career, Harder served as interim manager of the Indians for the last game of the season and the last two games of , winning all three contests. Late in his tenure, prominent young pitchers as Sam McDowell, Tommy John and Luis Tiant would come under his guidance. He was fired after the 1963 season, having spent the first 36 years of his adult life in Cleveland. He later coached with the New York Mets (1964), Chicago Cubs (1965), Cincinnati Reds (1966‚Äì68) and Kansas City Royals (1969). Cleveland retired his pitching uniform number 18 on July 28, 1990 (he wore 43 and 2 as a coach), and he was named one of the Indians' top 100 players in 2001. In 2002, Harder died in Chardon, Ohio at age 93; at the time of his death, he had been one of only five living players who had played in the 1920s.

It was an iron block/aluminum head DOHC design with 4 valves per cylinder. All 54¬∞ engines were assembled at Ellesmere Port in England. History In the early 1990s, Opel identified the need for a modern, lightweight and compact power plant to replace its aging straight-six engine range. These engines have a cast iron engine block with cast aluminium alloy cylinder heads. The cylinder heads contain 4 valves per cylinder actuated by dual overhead camshafts which are driven by a timing belt. These engines however, differed from many modern V6 engines in that it has a 54 degree cylinder bank angle; as opposed to the more conventional 60 degree setup. This added to the engines' compactness which was needed to allow its use in front-wheel drive applications, as well as rear-wheel drive cars. Other features of these engines include: an oil to water heat exchanger is mounted within the V of the engine block, Bosch Motronic engine management system with full sequential fuel injection, knock control on each bank, Distributorless Ignition System (DIS), and closed loop lambda control. Minor changes were made to the unit during its production, including an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the head machining (T-Vents), and modified valve lifters to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the cam belt arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving. Around 1998, the spin-on metal canister oil filter was changed to a disposable paper element. Revision The engine was reworked substantially in 2000 in order to meet increasing emission requirements; with the 2.5 and 3.0 being replaced by lower compression 2.6 and 3.2 units. While displacement was changed the bore centers and deck height were retained. These later power plants had a revised engine management system setup, which used quad lambda sensor control, coil per plug ignition system and drive by wire throttles. The 3.2 also received a stronger steel crankshaft. As a result of these changes the EGR and secondary air injection system were removed. Recalls In its 3.0 L form, this engine was notable for recalls of all units installed in Cadillac Cateras due to timing belt tensioner bearing failures, which could cause catastrophic damage to the engine because of its interference design. 2.5 The C25XE or B258I has an bore and stroke which displaces . It produces a Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN) rated output of @ 6,000 rpm, and generates @ 3,200 rpm of torque. It was introduced in the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier (both codenamed \\"Vectra-A\\") and Opel/Vauxhall Calibra. It features Bosch Motronic 2.8.1 engine management (omega) then M2.8.3 (calibra 1994, vectra 1995) in 1994 approx. and a compression ratio of 10.8:1. For 1994, in order to meet more stringent emission requirements, a secondary air injection system, and an EGR valve were added to the C25XE and it became the X25XE. The exception being the 1997 Calibras, which, due to unavailability of C25XE engine blocks, were produced using the X25XE block but without modifications to the top end of the engine, and without addition of EGR. The X25XE also benefitted from higher volume oil pump. Firing order is 1-2-3-4-5-6 The breakdown of the engine nameTopbuzz, \\"Engine Codes Explained\\", Topbuzz Website, 2002.

Science Fiction Book Club) Cover artist: Tom Kidd The Sarantine Mosaic is a historical fantasy duology by Canadian writer Guy Gavriel Kay, comprising Sailing to Sarantium (1998) and Lord of Emperors (2000). The titles of the novels allude to works by poet W. B. Yeats. The story's setting is based on the 6th century Mediterranean world, and the looming conflict between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy that had replaced the Western Roman Empire. Varena, the capital of Batiara, alludes to Ravenna, the Ostrogothic capital, while Sarantium, the capital of Trakesia, is inspired by Byzantium or Constantinople. The novels The Lions of Al-Rassan, The Last Light of the Sun, and A Brightness Long Ago also take place in that unnamed world, although in different settings. In the series the audience is also briefly acquainted with the character Ashar ibn Ashar, who is the creator of the Asharite religion seen in The Lions of Al-Rassan. The seeds of change for the great empire based in Sarantium are thus already being sown even at the height of its power and prestige. Sailing to Sarantium Sailing to Sarantium, the first novel in the saga, was published in 1998. In this novel, mosaicist Caius Crispus (\\"Crispin\\"), is summoned from Varena to the great metropolis of Sarantium to create a mosaic for Emperor Valerius II (modelled on Byzantine emperor Justinian I). Crispin has lost his family to plague, and has nothing left to him except his mosaic art, for which he is earning attention. The narration follows his travels from the relatively civilized Batiara through the wilder region of Sauradia, where he has an encounter with a creature of supernatural aspect resembling a bison, to Sarantium itself and his compelled entrance into the politics of the metropolis, centred on Valerius and his consort, the Empress Alixana (modelled on Justinian's empress, Theodora). While Crispin is a central focus of the book, there are other stories interwoven with his. Overcoming loss (loss of family, loss of the past), rebuilding (life, civilization), journey as change and the importance of art to the individual creator and to civilization itself are themes of the novel. The title and much of the thematic development alludes to the poem Sailing to Byzantium, a work of the Irish poet William Butler Yeats.Dena Taylor, On Sailing to Sarantium, TransVersions 10, Toronto: Orchid Press, 1999, republished on Bright Weavings (Kay's authorized website) Plot Emperor Apius of Sarantium dies without any heirs, leaving the empire in uncertainty. Petrus of Trakesia plans to have his uncle, Valerius of Trakesia, the Count of the Excubitors (Imperial Guard), become the next emperor. He plants his own men among the different factions to make, and purposely botch, an attempt to have them support Flavius Daleinus, a rich and influential aristocrat with plans to become emperor, thus discrediting Flavius‚Äôs name. At the same time, and also ordered by Petrus, Flavius is murdered on the streets with Sarantine fire while wearing porphyry, a colour exclusive to royalty, and his eldest son is left hideously burned. Valerius is then appointed as the new Emperor by popular demand. Fifteen years later, Petrus has succeeded his uncle, naming himself Valerius II and making Alixana, formerly Aliana, his empress. Valerius II commissions a great sanctuary to Jad and summons Martinian of Batiara, a renowned mosaicist, to decorate it. The royal request is sent with Pronobius Tilliticus, an Imperial Courier, who delays delivery of the message while pursuing personal pleasure along the road. Martinian, partially on whim and partially believing himself too old to travel, causes Tilliticus to mistake his friend and colleague Caius Crispus (\\"Crispin\\") of Rhodias for him, delivering the message in a public fashion. Crispin is reluctant to accept the prestigious summons, having lost the desire to live when his wife and two daughters died of the plague the previous year. The summons having been much delayed, the season no longer allows Crispin to sail to Sarantium; he must take the road. Martinian sends Crispin to talk to his old and well-traveled friend Zoticus for advice on his journey. Zoticus reveals himself to have some supernatural powers and gives Crispin a mechanical bird, Linon, that is alive, being able to both talk to him aloud and within his mind. He also gives Crispin the name of his daughter and another person in Sarantium who may be able to help him. The night before he is to leave, Crispin is forcibly abducted and taken to Gisel, the queen of the Antae and ruler over Batiara and Rhodias. The Antae are suspicious that a woman, especially a young one, can rule effectively and Gisel is barely holding onto her throne and life after the recent death of her father. She gives Crispin a secret message to be given only to Emperor Valerius II: an offer of her hand in marriage, which would save her life and give Valerius the western kingdom as well as an heir, as the imperial couple is childless. The palace guards from that night are killed to protect the secret. Crispin starts his journey under the assumed identity of Martinian, hiring a man named Vargos as his servant. The night before the Day of the Dead, during which Zoticus warned him not to travel, Crispin arrives at an inn where a slave girl, Kasia, begs him to save her, having figured out she is to be given as a human sacrifice to the pagan god on the Day of the Dead. Despite devising an ingenious plan that forces the innkeeper to give him ownership of Kasia, Crispin with his companions is still pursued as they leave the inn, deeming it necessary to travel on the Day of the Dead despite all warnings. They are saved by a zubir, a corporeal representation of the pagan god, which then brings them to the forested area where the human sacrifices are performed. Linon realizes the god wants only her, revealing that she was a girl to be sacrificed to the god long ago but her soul was saved and placed in the bird by Zoticus. She sacrifices herself, releasing her soul from the bird, and allowing the others to leave unharmed. While admiring an old and impressive mosaic in a sanctuary along the road, Crispin is found by Carullus, a captain leading a squad of soldiers; he has been sent by Valerius due to extended time it has taken to respond to the Emperor's summons. After an initial rough encounter, resulting in Crispin being knocked unconscious by Carullus and Vargos and Kasia almost being raped and killed, the group slowly become friends as they finally arrive in Sarantium. Shortly after arriving, Crispin is immediately summoned to the Emperor and the court, at a speed that is unheard of in the empire. Risking his life, Crispin reveals his true identity only to find out that the Emperor and Empress knew his and Martinian's deception from the beginning. Crispin quickly finds favour with them, causing the royal mosaicist to be dismissed and angering his sponsor, Styliane Daleina, the daughter of the murdered Flavius Daleina and new wife of Leontes, the beloved royal Strategos. The Emperor gives Crispin the honour of decorating the newly erected sanctuary, and Empress Alixana publicly invites Crispin for a private audience later that night. Crispin's private audience with the Empress is interrupted by the Emperor and the two reveal that they know of Gisel's secret offer of marriage, while Crispin neither confirms or denies the message. It becomes clear that the Emperor will not put aside his beloved though believed to be barren wife - an assumed consequence of her former life as a dancer - but informs both that he had long since summoned the queen to Sarantium, where he plans to use her as an excuse to invade the west and reunite the kingdoms under his rule. The Emperor then brings Crispin to the sanctuary to show him where he is to work, before leaving him under the protection of Carullus to return home. While returning home, Crispin is attacked by assassins, but survives due to the help of Carullus and the famous and beloved Scortius of the Blues, the most renowned charioteer of the city. Crispin returns to his room only to find Styliane Daleina there; she propositions him and is amused when he rejects her advances. The next day, while relaxing in a bath house, Crispin finds himself alone with Leontes, the latter having arranged it to discuss his views on the blasphemy of depicting Jad in human form. Before leaving, Leontes exposes another armed assassin entering the sauna, giving Crispin just enough time to overcome his attacker while looking on and refusing to help. Crispin makes contact with Zoticus's daughter, Shirin, principal dancer of the Greens. She is revealed to also have one of her father's birds whose thoughts Crispin is able to hear for unknown reasons. With the help of Vargos, it is learned that the assassins were hired by Pronobius Tilliticus as revenge for losing his job when Crispin indirectly revealed his inappropriate and disloyal services. In Batiara, three Antae noblemen plot to murder Gisel during the dedication of the sanctuary where her father is to be buried. However, on the day of the assassination, it is discovered that the woman believed to be the queen is her servant in disguise. Gisel, with Zoticus‚Äôs help, has fled to Sarantium. Zoticus, upon learning that the pagan god had not forgotten nor relinquished his right to the souls of the human sacrifices given to him, journeys to the forested area where Linon had sacrificed herself to the zubir. There he allows the remaining souls in his mechanical birds to be released back to the god and accepts his death from the zubir, a punishment from taking the souls of the sacrificed woman in the first place. Crispin further entwines himself into court life and finds reason to continue living through his task of decorating the great sanctuary, through which he sees a chance of immortality. The book ends with an unknown female figure entering the sanctuary while Crispin is working, irresistibly drawing him down to greet her. Lord of Emperors Lord of Emperors was published in 2000. The story continues from Sailing to Sarantium and tells of what happens to Crispin after his arrival in the city of Sarantium. Crispin has been charged with a project to cover the interior of the dome of a grand new religious building in Sarantium with a mosaic work. The confidant of both Alixana, the empress, and of the exiled Queen Gisel of Crispin's native Batiara (modelled on the Ostrogoth queen, Amalasuntha), Crispin struggles to survive the political machinations of the era and work on his mosaic. The reader is also introduced to Rustem of Kerakek, a physician from Bassania, an eastern empire roughly analogous to Sassanid Persia, who has also journeyed to the city, finding himself entangled in political intrigue. A significant theme of the book is the interplay between the lives of the politically powerful and the interests of the ordinary people, typified by the chariot races at the hippodrome which become an all-consuming passion for the people even as the empire draws closer to war and upheaval.Thomas M. Wagner, review of The Lord of Emperors, on SF Reviews.net Plot Rustem of Kerakek, a physician from Bassania, is summoned by Shirvan, the King of Kings of Bassania, after being wounded with a poisoned arrow. Rustem saves his life and helps reveal that it is the king's son who was behind the assassination attempt. Shirvan rewards the doctor with the promise of raising him to the priestly caste and making him a court physician. However, Shirvan first commands Rustem to go to Sarantium to act as his spy. He leaves behind his two wives and their children, a baby girl and a seven-year-old boy named Shaksi who is suggested to have unusual powers of perception. Shaksi's premonitions later compel the family to depart from Kerakek and follow Rustem to Sarantium. In the capital, Crispin has further settled into his work of creating the mosaic in the sanctuary. He plans to immortalize his wife and daughters, as well as Linon and an image of the zubir, alongside Jad. Carullus has proposed to Kasia and their wedding draws together most of the influential people of the city through the help of their friends. Upon arriving in Sarantium, Rustem's servant (who is secretly his guard and protector) is murdered by a young aristocrat. In the process of fleeing for his life through the city, Rustem meets Crispin, who brings him to Kasia and Carullus's wedding. There Rustem discovers that the murderer of his servant is Cleontes, the son of the Master of the Senate. He approaches the family and subtly blackmails the Senator with this information to secure himself a home and protection in the city as compensation. It is revealed that Rustem was the second person Zoticus had told Crispin to meet - somehow knowing the Bassanid would go to Sarantium long before his arrival. Rustem quickly establishes himself practicing medicine in the city but is disturbed when he receives an order from the King of Kings to assassinate a woman. Emperor Valerius II makes it known to a few that he intends to wage war to reclaim Batiara in the name of Queen Gisel. Crispin, while at the house of Leontes, allows himself to be seduced by Styliane this time, and escapes through the window when Leontes returns. Styliane tells him of the upcoming invasion of his homeland and also warns him not to become attached to his work. It is revealed that Empress Alixana was the woman who approached Crispin at the end of the first novel. She again comes to Crispin as he finishes his wife's image in the mosaic and is about to begin that of his daughters. She takes him on a boat ride under the premise of showing him dolphins, which she wishes him to put in a mosaic for her private chambers. This depiction is a dangerous one for the Empress to request due to dolphins' association with the god Heladikos, who some worship as the son of Jad but has been declared paganistic and heretical by the Patriarchs of the faith. The boat arrives at an island where Lecanus Daleinus, the oldest son of the assassinated Flavius Daleinus, is imprisoned; he was hideously burned and blinded by Sarantine Fire during the assassination. Alixana impersonates Styliane's voice to try get information from him. Crispin hears the thoughts of yet another mechanical bird talking to Lecanus in his head and realises that although Lecanus cannot see the Empress, he is not deceived. After they leave, he confesses what he heard to Alixana, who quickly deduces that an assassination attempt is being made on her husband. They return to Lecanus's hut only to find him gone and his guards killed. A guard attempts to assassinate Alixana but is stopped by Crispin. Alixana tells Crispin to return to the boat with one of her two remaining loyal guards and asks him how he found a reason to live after having lost his family. She returns to Sarantium on a small boat with her remaining guard, discarding her royal robes, cutting her hair, and changing her appearance. Upon arriving in the docks, she disappears into the crowds, disguised as a whore. Emperor Valerius II is confronted by all three surviving Daleinoi children, including Styliane and Lecanus, in his personal passage between palaces, his guards having been bribed. He quickly deduces that they intend to kill him with Sarantine fire as revenge for the death of their father. He banters with them, trying to undermine each of them and their hold on the guards. He almost succeeds escaping, but is stabbed in the back by Leontes's secretary, Pertennius Eubulus - a man who hated the Emperor and Empress, perceiving them to be impious. Lecanus burns the Emperor's body along with the guards before allowing himself to be burned, taking the sole blame for the events. The city erupts in a riot. Leontes is quickly chosen as the new Emperor while Styliane claimed to have arrived too late to stop her brother after learning of his plans. A citywide search for the Empress is started, with guards going from house to house. Rustem, returning home late after treating many riot victims, finds Empress Alixana in his bedroom. She quickly reveals she knew his goal as a spy and asks his help in hiding her while revealing that she knew he had already refused orders to assassinate Queen Gisel. It is also revealed Alixana had already visited the doctor in disguise as a commoner with fertility problems, and Rustem had informed her that she was not barren - thus the imperial couple's failure to conceive an heir is due to the Emperor's sterility. Rustem helps save her life as she pretends to be a prostitute when the Saratine soldiers break into the doctor's home. After the soldiers leave, Rustem allows Alixana to stay the night, finding her gone in the morning. That same night, Gisel summons Crispin and has him help her slip into the palace. Gisel manages to meet with Leontes, persuading him to see Styliane's role in the whole event and convincing him to take her as his new wife. In doing so, the new emperor will have a means of re-taking Batiara while minimizing bloodshed. Styliane is blinded and imprisoned on the same isle her brother had been on, while her remaining brother is found and executed. Based on information given to him by Alixana before her departure, Rustem realizes that he cannot return to Bassania or he will be killed by the King of Kings for his failure to assassinate Gisel. His family then arrives on his doorstep, accompanied by the soldier who first brought the doctor to Shirvan. Together, they decide that they will travel yet further west, to the peninsula of Esperana, and settle there. Leontes explains to Crispin that all images of Jad are to be destroyed and images of humans and Jad in sanctuaries are seen as blasphemy. Crispin is crushed by the news that his mosaic is to be destroyed, seeing it as a second death of his wife and daughters. He decides to finish the images of his daughters before they are destroyed anyway, and once they are complete, that it is time to return home. Crispin says goodbye to all his friends. He is summoned a final time by the new Empress Gisel, and is permitted to go visit Styliane before he leaves. Styliane asks Crispin to kill her, realizing life had nothing left for her in her current state and having already achieved her revenge. He refuses but leaves a dagger that Gisel had, knowingly, given him during their meeting. Shirin confronts Crispin before he leaves where she manages to get Crispin to indirectly indicate he has feelings for her and that she should perhaps eventually join him in Batiara. Upon arriving home, Crispin finds Martinian and royal couriers waiting for him. Gisel has greatly rewarded him with wealth, as she had originally promised if he were to successfully deliver her message to Emperor Valerius II. She has also sent him materials from Sarantium, such as high-quality glass and stones, needed to create a great mosaic, promising the work would be protected as long as an image of Jad was not made. Crispin spends the next year making an elaborate mosaic in a small abandoned sanctuary, while Martinian decorates the adjoining larger and newer sanctuary in an appropriate way, finally having access to the great materials he had always dreamed of throughout his career. Crispin's mosaic depicts the newly appointed Emperor Valerius III (formerly Leontes) and Empress Gisel on one side and the former Emperor Valerius II and Empress Alixana on the other, with all the important figures of court that Crispin had known, including himself, around them. In a mirror of the ending of the first book, just as Crispin finishes the last piece of his mosaic, a woman distracts him from his work. Assuming it is Shirin finally come to meet him, he is surprised to see Aliana, no longer Alixana after having disappeared that night. She comments on herself in the mosaic and the two of them realize that they have a reason in each other to continue living. The novel ends with them talking about having children together.

Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, p. 45 Construction and career Burns, named for Otway Burns, was launched 4 July 1918 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Miss Alice H. Palmer, and commissioned 7 August 1919, Commander W. H. Lee in command. Burns was attached to Destroyer Force, Pacific, until March 1920 when she was ordered to special duty as a tender for NC Seaplane Division. On 15 March 1921 she was reclassified DM-11 and on 5 May she was assigned to the Mine Force, Pacific. She was at Mare Island Navy Yard 11 July undergoing conversion and overhaul when her home yard was changed and she departed for Naval Station Pearl Harbor, where she completed the yard period. Thereafter, attached to Mine Squadron 2 Pacific Fleet, she served throughout her active service in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands except for periodic concentrations of the Fleet in other areas for maneuvers and Fleet problems. In 1925 she joined the Fleet for a tour of Australia and New Zealand. In the summers of 1926, 1927, and 1928 she conducted training cruises for Naval Reservists. In 1927 Burns returned to San Diego with her squadron for inspection, training, and recreation. Returning to Pearl Harbor, she participated in mining and gunnery practice, and acted as a high-speed target for submarines in Hawaiian waters until November 1929. Arriving at San Diego 26 November, Burns was decommissioned 2 June 1930. On 11 June she was towed to Mare Island Navy Yard where she was used as a barracks ship. She was later scrapped and her material sold 22 April 1932.

Origins Cobain suggested his idea for an instrument to Fender, resulting in two left-handed prototypes built by former Custom Shop Master Builder Larry L. Brooks, only one of which was played by Cobain himself. In an interview from January 4, 1994, Cobain talked about designing the Jag-Stang, since it had not yet been produced. He stated to Nardwuar the Human Serviette that he designed it by taking a Polaroid of the Mustang and Jaguar, cutting them in half and combining them. It was shipped back to Fender for repairs before Cobain brought it with him on the European leg of Nirvana's In Utero tour in 1994, where the guitar was seldom played live. Cobain sketched a basic design that was sent to Fender, which was later published as part of his Journals in 2002. Cobain played the Jag-stang live only a few times, however at Nirvana's concert at Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana, Slovenia, he used the Jag-Stang for the entire show.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvG-8YjVdG8 ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say he played the Jag- Stang between two and five times on stage,‚Äù Bailey says. ‚ÄúThere was an early show where he may have used it for a song or two, and later on he may have used it for an entire show.‚Äù Bailey says that, to his knowledge, Cobain never recorded with the guitar. ‚ÄúKurt tended to record with guitars that he liked to play live, guitars he was real comfortable with,‚Äù Bailey says, ‚Äúand at that point the Jag-Stang wasn‚Äôt one of them. I believe the guitar showed up not long before the In Utero tour began, and there wasn‚Äôt a lot of recording going on then anyway.‚Äù Even though Fender had built the Jag-Stang to Cobain's specs, Bailey modified it as Cobain found things he wanted adjusted. ‚ÄúBasically everything that came in, including the Jag-Stang, I modified,‚Äù Bailey says. ‚ÄúKurt‚Äôs older Jaguar was already pretty heavily modded and he liked it pretty much the way it was. But there were always changes of one kind or another to almost everything‚Äù (\\"Legendary Guitars\\" by R. Moore 2012). Design Cobain's prototype Jag-Stang had a Fender Texas Special pickup at the neck and a DiMarzio H-3 at the bridge. (The H-3 humbucker is not available as an individual product but the closest sounding one is the DiMarzio DP158 Evolution Neck Pickup.) The production Jag-Stang includes a \\"vintage style\\" single coil pickup and one \\"special design\\" humbucker, each with its own toggle switch which a player can use to switch from \\"on\\", \\"off\\", or \\"out-of- phase\\" settings. It employs the Mustang's \\"Dynamic Vibrato\\" bridge and like both of its predecessors, it has a 24\\" short scale neck (an exact replica of Cobain's favorite neck, from a Fender Mustang). Originally produced in the fall of 1995, after Kurt Cobain's death, Fender Japan reissued the Jag-Stang two years after its 2001 cancellation due to popular demand. Fender once again discontinued importing the Jag-Stang from Japan as of May 2006. Jag-Stang users Over-sized 1970s-style head stock on a 1996 Jag-Stang. Kurt Cobain is the one who recommended the idea to Fender, picking up the \\"Jag-Stang.\\" Kurt was the first to receive and play the guitar, which also featured a mimic of his favorite guitar neck. He used it on rare occasions. He only used the bridge pickup, a DiMarzio H-3 humbucker, that was replaced by a Seymour Duncan JB SH-4 at some time. Cobain's Sonic Blue Jag-Stang was given to R.E.M.'s Peter Buck by Courtney Love after Cobain died. He can be seen playing it (modified for right-handed playing) on the \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" music video. Mike Mills, also from R.E.M., played this same guitar in concert during the song \\"Let Me In\\", itself a tribute to Kurt Cobain. An example of this can be seen on their Road Movie DVD.

He is the author of two documentaries, They Chose Freedom and Nemtsov. Kara-Murza holds an M.A. in history from Cambridge University. He currently acts as Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. He was awarded the Civil Courage Prize in 2018. Early life, family, and education Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza was born in Moscow on 7 September 1981. He is the son of Russian journalist and television host Vladimir Alexeyevich Kara-Murza (1959‚Äì2019), an outspoken critic of Leonid Brezhnev and a supporter of reforms under Boris Yeltsin. His father was a great-grandson of Latvian revolutionary VoldemƒÅrs Bisenieks (1884‚Äì1938), and great-grand-nephew of Latvia's first Ambassador to Great Britain, Georgs Bisenieks (1885‚Äì1941; lv), both of whom were shot by the NKVD. The Latvian agronomist and publisher JƒÅnis Bisenieks (1864‚Äì1923; lv) was their older brother.Information from the Russian Wikipedia entry on Georgs Bisenieks. He is also related to Sergey Kara-Murza (born 1939), a Soviet/Russian historian, chemist and philosopher. They are members of the Kara-Murza family, descendants of a Tatar aristocrat who settled in Moscow and converted to Christianity in the 15th century AD. (The name in translation means \\"Black Lord\\".) Kara-Murza earned a B.A. and an M.A. degree in history at Cambridge University.\\"Vladimir Kara-Murza\\", World Affairs Journal With his wife, Yevgenia, he has three children. Work as a journalist, film-maker and author Kara-Murza became a journalist at the age of 16. He worked as London correspondent for a succession of Russian media outlets: the newspapers Novye Izvestia (1997‚Äì2000) and Kommersant (September 2000 to June 2003) and the radio station Ekho Moskvy from September 2001 to June 2003. Kara-Murza then briefly became foreign affairs correspondent of Kommersant (July 2003 to April 2004) and Washington correspondent for the BBC (December 2004 to December 2005). In 2002, he was editor-in-chief of the London-based financial publication Russian Investment Review. In April 2004 he took over as the Washington bureau chief of the RTVi television network, a post he held for the next nine years. On 1 September 2012 he was dismissed from this job. They Chose Freedom, a documentary series (2005) In 2005, Kara-Murza produced a four-part TV documentary, They Chose Freedom, dedicated to the history of the Soviet dissident movement. The documentary was based on interviews with Russian dissidents, including Vladimir Bukovsky, Elena Bonner and Sergei Kovalev. It was first aired in October 2005. It has since been screened at various locations in Europe and North America, with subtitles added in English.\\"They Chose Freedom: The Story of Soviet Dissidents\\" film screening at Columbia Harriman Institute, 11 February 2014.\\"They Chose Freedom: The Story of Soviet Dissidents\\", film screeing at Freedom House, 13 February 2014.

Based on the original 1906 parliamentary record and contemporary newspaper reports, as well as memoirs by participants of the events, the book was launched in both Moscow and Saint Petersburg. \\"Spotlight on Russia\\" blog (since 2010) Since 2010 Kara- Murza has written a weekly blog, \\"Spotlight on Russia\\", for World Affairs Journal.http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/ In late 2014 and early 2015, he wrote about a number of anti democratic trends in Russia. President Vladimir Putin, for example, had resumed the Soviet practice of stripping dissidents of their Russian citizenship. As a result of this and other acts, Kara-Murza urged the Council of Europe not to restore Russia's voting rights, suspended since the annexation of Crimea. Kremlin SWAT teams, he wrote in December 2014, were breaking up opposition meetings. Putin's word was therefore \\"void of value\\", wrote Kara-Murza, citing as evidence the false statements made by the Russian President and his broken promises. \\"The End of Russia's Olympic Truce\\" (2014) Putin had soft-pedaled his response to the opposition during the Sochi Olympics, warned Kara-Murza in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal (26 February 2014). Now that the prestigious international event was ended the Russian president was rapidly returning to his former oppressive behaviour. Only hours after the closing ceremony in Sochi a Moscow court handed prison sentences to seven of the May 2012 Bolotnaya Square protestors. Pressure was brought to bear not only within Russia. Russia's nationwide TV had been broadcasting \\"hate-filled appeals to crush the protesters in Kiev\\" for several weeks early in 2014, noted Kara-Murza. For Putin, he explained, \\"maintaining the status quo in Ukraine was not primarily about preserving a post-Soviet sphere of influence or recreating a Moscow-led empire\\". The Russian president feared that \\"a democratic, pro-European Ukraine\\" would set \\"a 'dangerous' precedent for Russia\\" and that it would be \\"only a matter of time\\" before Russian citizens began to demand similar levels of political and economic freedom.  In the Public Eye From 1999 to 2001, Kara-Murza was a member of the Democratic Choice of Russia party; from 2001 to 2008 he was a member of the Union of Right Forces. Between 2000 and 2003 he served as an advisor to State Duma opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. He has been in opposition to Vladimir Putin since 2000, backing liberal candidate Grigory Yavlinsky in the 2000 presidential election. Stands for election to the State Duma (2003) Kara-Murza was a candidate for election to the Russian parliament, or State Duma, in the 2003 parliamentary election, running in Moscow's Chertanovsky district.

At the same meeting, Kara-Murza was elected as Bukovsky's plenipotentiary representative to Russia's Central Electoral Commission.\\"A group of voters support Bukovsky's nomination as a candidate for the presidency of the Russian Federation\\", The Action Group website (–ì—Ä—É–ø–ø–∞ –∏–∑–±–∏—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –≤ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫—É –≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–∞ –ë—É–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –°–∞–π—Ç –ò–Ω–∏—Ü–∏–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã), 21 December 2007.\\"823 people supported Bukovsky's nomination for the presidency of the Russian Federation\\", The Action Group website (823 —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏ –≤—ã–¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–∞ –ë—É–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –°–∞–π—Ç –ò–Ω–∏—Ü–∏–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã), 17 December 2007.

Alexei Navalny placed first. Institute of Modern Russia, 2012 Soon after, on 1 November 2012, Kara-Murza was hired by the Institute of Modern Russia as the organisation's senior policy advisor. \\"It is an honor for me to join this distinguished institute and contribute to its mission of keeping the spotlight on the situation in Russia and advocating for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law\\", said Kara-Murza, \\"These values should remain at the forefront of international relations.\\" In this capacity he took part in panel discussions about Russia's future at the Heritage Foundation in February 2013 and in October 2013, with Pavel Khodorkovsky (son of the former entrepreneur and philanthropist Mikhail Khodorkovsky) and others, in a similar discussion hosted by the National Endowment for Democracy. Open Russia Kara-Murza is a coordinator of the Open Russia Foundation, founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The organisation was created with the goal of promoting civil society and democracy in Russia, while revoking Putin's grip on power. Launched in 2014, Open Russia has been instrumental in educating Russian citizens on western democracy, whilst bringing opposition groups and activists in contact with support from the west. Kara-Murza is deputy chairman and heads Open elections project designed to promote free and fair elections in Russia; a task he has noted is exceedingly difficult given the government's ability to silence opposition and manipulate elections. He also frequently addresses international stages to promote further cooperation and discussion among nations.  Funeral pallbearer for John McCain  In April 2018, United States Senator John McCain sent Kara-Murza a message revealing that McCain had been diagnosed with brain cancer and requesting that Kara-Murza, who had worked with McCain on issues relating to Russia since 2010, serve as a pallbearer at the senator's eventual funeral. Kara-Murza later said that he was \\"speechless\\", \\"heartbroken\\", and \\"close to tears\\", and that doing so would be \\"the most heartbreaking honor that anyone could think of\\". McCain died on 25 August; Kara-Murza joined fourteen others chosen by McCain himself, including former Vice-President Joe Biden and actor Warren Beatty, as a pallbearer at McCain's funeral at the Washington National Cathedral on 1 September. McCain's choice of Kara-Murza was described by Politico as a \\"final dig\\" at Putin, of whom McCain was a vocal critic, and at U.S. President Donald Trump, for his apparent closeness to the Russian president. Kara-Murza and the 2012 U.S. Magnitsky Act As a journalist and public figure, who was fluent in English and based partly in the USA, Kara-Murza Jr played a notable part in the events that led, in 2012, to the passing of the \\"Magnitsky\\" Act by the US Congress. In July 2012, Kara-Murza reported that he had been denied access a few days earlier to the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. This decision was taken on the orders of the ambassador himself, on the grounds that Kara-Murza was \\"no longer a journalist\\". Yet it was not until 1 September that Kara-Murza's dismissal as Washington bureau chief of RTVi was made public. According to several sources he was now on a \\"blacklist\\" and could not be employed as a journalist by any Russian media outlets. The reason for this ban was his advocacy of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, then being considered by the US Congress.Vladimir Kara-Murza, \\"Putin‚Äôs regime takes 'retaliatory' measures against supporters of Magnitsky legislation\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 August 2012. The draft law was named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer who uncovered a massive tax-fraud scheme involving several law- enforcement officials and who died in custody of those same officials in 2009 after being tortured and denied medical care. Its purpose was to prevent the issuing of U.S. visas to persons \\"responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky\\", (and for \\"extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\\" in Russia) and to freeze access to any U.S.-based assets those persons might hold. The law also extended to cover Russian officials involved in broader acts of corruption and in violations of basic civil liberties. Kara-Murza explained his support for the law by saying that \\"The prospect of losing access to the West and its financial systems...may well be, for now, the only serious disincentive to corruption and human rights violations by Russian officials.\\" Writing in the National Interest Mark Adomanis warned that the Magnitsky law came with a cost. It had \\"potential downsides,\\" and was worsening \\"Russia's already precarious human-rights situation\\", driving \\"some of the ever- dwindling number of effective opposition journalists\\" from the country. In particular he cited the firing of Kara-Murza, although the journalist's employers described his dismissal as part of \\"a long-planned reorganization\\". Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, reported Adomanis, \\"suggested the decision to fire Kara-Murza may have come from an extremely high-ranking official: Alexei Gromov, the deputy head of the presidential administration.\\" An article in July by Peter Baker of the New York Times was devoted largely to the arguments of the law's critics. He did quote Kara-Murza's comment that the bill would hit corrupt officials and human-rights violators \\"where it hurts, closing access to their ill-gotten gains in the West.\\" On 25 July 2012, Kara-Murza testified before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the U.S. Congress about human-rights abuses in Russia and described the proposed Magnitsky Law as \\"a pro-Russian bill which provides a much-needed measure of accountability for those who continue to violate the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens.\\" He added: \\"The Kremlin's reaction to this legislation shows that it hits them precisely where it hurts. I want to take this opportunity to thank Co-Chairmen McGovern and Wolf for their leadership on this issue. I hope the Magnitsky Act is signed into law before the end of this year.\\"Testimony of Vladimir V. Kara-Murza, \\"Worldwide Threats to Media Freedom\\", Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, 25 July 2012. In a December 2012 article co-written with Nemtsov, Kara-Murza reiterated his support for the Magnitsky Act which he and Nemtsov called \\"a pro-Russian law that strikes at the heart of the Kremlin's mafia-like system\\", adding that \\"Russian opposition and civil society leaders and cultural figures, as well as a plurality of Russian citizens, are in favour of the Magnitsky law.\\" On 12 December 2012, the Magnitsky Act became United States law. Appeals for Canada and the EU to follow suit Kara- Murza and Nemtsov called on Canada to pass a similar piece of legislation, then under consideration by the International Human Rights Subcommittee of the Canadian parliament's House of Commons. Writing for Macleans in December 2012, Michael Petrou reported Kara-Murza's visit to Ottawa to urge the passage of the proposed Canadian version of the Magnitsky law, a private member's bill introduced by Liberal MP Irwin Cotler: while it was the task of Russian opposition leaders, not foreigners, \\"to bring democratic change to Russia,\\" Kara-Murza said, Western democracies could still help the cause of Russian democracy through legislation. Those in Russia who had abused and tormented Magnitsky \\"rule in the style of Zimbabwe or Belarus,\\" wrote Petrou, paraphrasing Kara-Murza, \\"but prefer the West as a safe place to store their money, buy second homes, and send their children to school. And it is in the West where they are most vulnerable.\\" In June 2013, in an interview with France 24 television, Kara-Murza discussed the proposed version of the Magnitsky law then being debated in the European Parliament. He spoke in favour of such laws, and noted that the list of persons covered by the U.S. law was being expanded. He distinguished between those in the European Parliament who were \\"friends of Russia\\" and those who were \\"friends of Putin\\". In March 2014, noting that the average Russian opposes intervention in Ukraine by the government of Vladimir Putin, Kara-Murza stated that the world \\"should respond to Putin's aggression\\" by imposing sanctions against its perpetrators. He called for the list of Russian human-rights abusers who were already banned, under the Sergei Magnitsky Act, from travelling to the United States and keeping assets there to \\"be dramatically expanded to include senior Kremlin officials responsible for the attack on Ukraine and the crackdown against Russian citizens.\\" He also expressed the hope that \\"the European Union would soon follow with its own version of the Magnitsky sanctions.\\" \\"Those who commit acts of aggression and abuse the rights of their own citizens should not be entitled to the privileges and comfort of the democratic West,\\" he said. 'Nemtsov List' Presentation of the Nemtsov Report 2020 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in the Hofburg On 27 February 2015, Boris Nemtsov was executed with four shots from behind while he was sitting on a bridge near Red Square in Moscow. According to Bill Browder, Vladimir V. Kara-Murza is a prot√©g√© of Boris Nemtsov. In late April 2015, Vladimir V. Kara-Murza and Mikhail Kasyanov presented a list of eight names to members of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the US Congress. These were the TV presenters and other State- employed journalists and commentators who, Kara-Murza and Kasyanov explained, had created an atmosphere of \\"hatred, intolerance and violence\\" around the figure of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in the months leading up to his murder one hundred yards from the Kremlin. Specifically, the named individuals had stated on nationwide television that Nemtsov was a traitor, an enemy of Russia, part of a \\"Fifth Column\\" within the country, and that he would have welcomed the invading German forces outside Moscow in 1941.Interview with Kara-Murza on Voice of America TV, 30 April 2015 (in Russian). Kara-Murza explained the appeal to U.S. legislators by saying that Russia's law- enforcement agencies, unfortunately, had declined to investigate these recorded and documented statements although incitement to harm an individual was also a crime according to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. These eight names, Kara-Murza hoped, would now be added to those already on the Magnitsky List. The eight names were listed in the Kommersant daily newspaper.\\"The \\"Nemtsov List\\" has been presented to the Congress\\", Kommersant, 24 April 2015. On 18 May 2015 the daily newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov, a State Duma deputy for United Russia, had requested the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to assess whether Mikhail Kasyanov and Kara-Murza had not committed an act of treason, under Article 275 of the RF Criminal Code, by submitting the above list of eight names to members of the US Congress. When approached by the newspaper the Investigative Committee would not pass comment on deputy Fyodorov's statement.Vladimir Demchenko, \\"The RF Investigative Committee declines to comment on the deputy's statement about treason committed by the oppositionists Kasyanov and Kara-Murza\\", Komsomolskaya pravda, 18 May 2015. Illnesses  May‚ÄìJune 2015  On 26 May 2015, Kara-Murza was suddenly taken ill in Moscow during a meeting. He had eaten lunch at a restaurant and then had a two-hour meeting, during which he consumed nothing and felt normal, before becoming ill over a ten to fifteen minute period, leading to vomiting. At first he was thought to be having heart difficulties, but treatment at a specialised cardiac clinic did nothing to arrest the symptoms. He was then diagnosed with poisoning and taken to the First City Hospital.\\"Condition of opposition journalist Kara-Murza remains ‚Äòcritical‚Äô\\", The Interpreter, 28 May 2015. Coming after the murder of his colleague Boris Nemtsov on 27 February 2015, and mindful of other cases of poisoning, both in Russia (journalist and Duma deputy Yuri Shchekochikhin in 2003, the attempted murder of Anna Politkovskaya in 2004) and abroad (Alexander Litvinenko in October 2006) there was great concern on the part of friends and family.Robert van Voren, \\"Is Putin Poisoning his Opponents?\\", Rights in Russia website, 1 June 2015. His wife Yevgenia urged that he be evacuated from Russia for examination and treatment abroad. On 2 June, it was announced by a spokesman for the Republican Party of Russia ‚Äì People's Freedom Party that Kara-Murza had emerged from his coma and recognised his wife, who was now by his bedside.\\"Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr has emerged from his coma\\", Vesti.ru, 2 June 2015 (report in Russian). The cause of his sudden illness remained a mystery, but in an interview with the BBC his father commented, \\"if someone did want to frighten us, then they succeeded.\\"\\"Russian activist's sudden illness fuels poisoning suspicion\\", BBC News, Moscow, 4 June 2015. After his release from the hospital, Kara-Murza stated that it was difficult to \\"believe this was an accident\\", suspecting it was an intentional poisoning, but noted there was no way to be certain. On 15 August 2015 Mikhail Khodorkovsky commented with delight that Kara-Murza had returned to work co-ordinating the Open Elections project. Kara-Murza is working to provide free and fair elections for the Duma. 2017 recurrence On 2 February 2017, Kara-Murza was again hospitalised after the onset of the same symptoms as his prior illness. He was put in a medically-induced coma and was on life support. He was treated at the same hospital by the same medical team who had already saved his life in 2015. According to his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov, Kara-Murza was diagnosed by the hospital with 'toxic influence of an unknown substance'. He was released on 19 February and has gone abroad for rehabilitation. His lawyer sent the Russian Investigative Committee a request to open a criminal case into the alleged poisoning. A similar request after the 2015 incident had been turned down without an explanation. His blood samples were provided to a number of laboratories including one affiliated to the FBI. But for unclear reasons, the FBI subsequently have not revealed details of their investigations into the substance that triggered Kara-Murza‚Äôs illness, with one US Senator suggesting that it might be \\"classified\\".FBI Silent On Lab Results In Kremlin Foe's Suspected Poisoning 26 October 2018 www.rferl.org, accessed 15 September 2020 References Works ;Books * ;Articles         * External links *Results of the Russian parliamentary elections, 7 December 2003 *Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr, They Chose Freedom, 4-part TV documentary (in Russian, with English subtitles), 2005 *\\"Film on Soviet Dissidents Presented at Harvard University\\", SPS.ru, 7 March 2006 *\\"Vladimir Bukovsky Will Run for President of Russia in 2008\\", Prima-News Agency, 28 May 2007 *Vladimir Kara- Murza Jr, \\"Spotlight on Russia\\" blog, World Affairs Journal, since 2010  Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Russian people of Latvian descent Category:Alumni of Trinity Hall, Cambridge Category:People educated at The John Lyon School Category:Solidarnost politicians Category:21st-century Russian politicians Category:Union of Right Forces politicians Category:Yabloko politicians Category:People's Freedom Party politicians Category:2011‚Äì2013 Russian protests Category:Russian historians Category:Russian people of Tatar descent ","title":"Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza"},{"id":"1119537","text":"Gig or GIG may refer to: Arts and entertainment * Gig (music), a live performance by a musician or other performer * Gig (Circle Jerks album) (1992) * Gig (Northern Pikes album) (1993) * The Gig, a 1985 film written and directed by Frank D.

It is set in a peninsula of the same world in which The Sarantine Mosaic and The Last Light of the Sun are set, and is based on Moorish Spain. The novel concentrates on the relationships between the three peoples: the Kindath (analogous to the Jews), the Asharites (analogous to the Muslims), and the Jaddites (analogous to the Christians), although the religions of the Kindath, Asharites, and Jaddites, as described in the novel, bear no relation to Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. The three protagonists in the novel are from each of these three races and religions: Jehane bet Ishak, a Kindath physician in Fezana (loosely based on Rebecca of York); Rodrigo Belmonte, a Jaddite captain of a company of cavalry (loosely based on El Cid); and Ammar ibn Khairan, an Asharite poet, mercenary, and advisor to King Almalik of Cartada (loosely based on Muhammad ibn Ammar). Plot summary Like most of Kay's novels, this contains a large amount of political intrigue and religious strife. At the opening of the novel, the peninsula of Al-Rassan (formerly known as Espera√±a when under Jaddite control) is split between three Jaddite kingdoms in the north (Valledo, Ruenda and Jalo√±a) and Asharite kingdoms in the south, of which Cartada and Ragosa figure most prominently in the story. After centuries of being dominated by the Asharites, the Jaddite kingdoms are regaining their strength, while the once-powerful khalifate of Al-Rassan is divided and vulnerable. In Fezana, a city in the north of Al-Rassan close to the borderlands with Valledo, Jehane unwittingly prevents one of her patients, a merchant named Husari ibn Musa, from being executed by Asharite King Almalik of Cartada during a purge of Fezana's leading citizens. By giving Husari shelter when the danger is revealed, Jehane puts her own life in danger. As a result, she flees Fezana at the same time that the Jaddite commander Rodrigo Belmonte of Valledo and his company have come to Al-Rassan for their parias gold - regular tribute given to the Jaddite kingdoms. A different group of Valledans, led by the brother of the powerful constable of Valledo, brutally attack a village outside the walls of Fezana. Rodrigo steps in to halt the slaughter of the villagers, leading to the eventual death of the brother. As a result, Rodrigo is exiled by King Ramiro. Rodrigo and Jehane make their way to Ragosa, to the court of King Badir. Almalik set up the purge in Fezana to be blamed on his longtime courtier Ammar ibn Khairan. Ammar joins forces with the king's heir (also called Almalik) and assassinates the father. The new king Almalik II then exiles Ammar from Cartada and Ammar also travels to Ragosa. Rodrigo, Ammar and Jehane are brought together in the court of King Badir, where Ammar and Rodrigo are hired as mercenaries, and Jehane as a physician. They form a close connection which forms the heart of the story. Jehane develops feeling for Ammar but sees her relationship with Rodrigo to simply be that of friends. The admiration of the two men for each other is obvious, as they are the 'best' each nation has to offer. However the shelter and stability they find in the wealthy and worldly city of Ragosa is threatened by events occurring far beyond the city walls. The Jaddites begin a holy war against the Asharite kingdom of Ammuz and the Kindath city of Soriyya, in a rough parallel to the Crusades. Clerics from Ferrieres urge the kings of the Jaddite kingdoms of Espera≈àa to launch their own wars of reconquest against their Asharite neighbours. To the south of Al- Rassan, in the Majriti Desert lands, the Muwardis, who practice a stricter version of the Asharite religion, are impelled to intervene in the affairs of Al-Rassan, as much to repel the Jaddites as to cleanse the Asharite lands of their luxury-loving leaders. Both the Jaddites and the Asharites also exhibit violent outbreaks against the Kindath. Jehane's father, the famed physician Ishak ben Yonannon and her mother, Eliane, are rescued by Rodrigo just as a violent mob in Fezana storm the Kindath quarter with the intent of massacring its residents. Ishak then performs an astonishing operation on Diego, the young son of Rodrigo, who has been savagely assaulted by the Muwardi. The deep loyalties of Rodrigo Belmonte and Ammar ibn Khairan to Valledo and Cartada respectively mean that their eventual conflict becomes inevitable. The two finally meet on the battlefield, each at the head of opposing armies. The two commanders duel and one is killed. The story concludes with an afterword set some years in the future, which reveals firstly that the Jaddite kingdoms have recaptured Al-Rassan (mirroring the Reconquista) and eventually the identity of the victor of the duel. Major themes The interplay between bigotry and tolerance is a major theme of the novel. The stories of the main characters are interwoven in such a way that each is responsible for saving the lives of persons who are loved by the others. The surgery to save Diego Belmonte is seen as a key event: \\"In this scene, the son of a Jaddite warleader is saved through an Asharite's warning and a Kindath's medical skill; it hints at the possibility of peaceful interaction among the three embattled religious groups.\\"Holly Ordway, The World-Building of Guy Gavriel Kay, PhD thesis The possibility of cooperation between people of different faith is glimpsed as an ideal that leads to the miraculous, in this case an extraordinary act of surgery. It is in the Epilogue, in the Kindath city of Sorenica, rebuilt after its destruction by Jaddites at the outset of their holy war, where the possibilities of co-existence are realized.Dena Taylor, Three Glasses of Wine: The Accommodation of Culture in The Lions of Al-Rassan http://www.brightweavings.com/scholarship/denalions.htm The uses and misuses of religion for political ends are also demonstrated in the novel, with rulers and clergy using religion to manipulate the people and their leaders into desired courses of action.Dena Taylor, Three Glasses of Wine: The Accommodation of Culture in The Lions of Al-Rassan http://www.brightweavings.com/scholarship/denalions.htm The definition of civilization and the search for the attributes of a civilized society in a hard divided world is another theme of the novel. Kay characterizes the relatively liberal and tolerant Asharite city of Ragosa or the Kindath city of Sorenica as places of civilization. Silvenes, the capital of the former Khalifate of Al-Rassan, now ruined and largely abandoned, is seen wistfully as the symbol of civilization lost. In contrast, the cruder Jaddite cities of Espera√±a with their increasing military power and the ascetic desert communities of the Muwardi Asharites are places with fewer of the attributes of civilization. While Kay presents war and conquest with an air of nobility and grandeur, the novel also constantly reminds the reader of the real price of war paid in bloodshed, loss and grief.Rob Kilheffer, Review of The Lions of Al-Rassan for Fantasy and Science-Fiction Magazine, retrieved from Brightweavings, the Worlds of Guy Gavriel Kay http://www.brightweavings.com/reviews/revlions.htm#washington Awards * Geffen Award (Translated Fantasy Books) nominee, 2005 References External links * The Lions of Al-Rassan at Guy Gavriel Kay's Authorized Website.

In April 2001, in protest at the seizure of NTV by the Russian government, Kara-Murza, along with other NTV journalists (Yevgeny Kiselyov, Viktor Shenderovich, Mikhail Osokin, Svetlana Sorokina), went to TV-6 channel, where he became anchor of the evening news programme Grani (\\"Angles\\" or \\"Points of View\\"). When TV6 was closed down by the government in January 2002, its journalists contested the competition for the frequency, and won, returning in June 2002 as TVS channel. Kara-Murza continued his Grani programme, which enjoyed some of the highest viewer ratings on Russian television. In June 2003, TVS, Russia's last independent television channel, was removed from the air by order of the Press Ministry. From August 2003, Kara-Murza wss the evening news anchor at RTVi channel. He was the father of opposition politician Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza.  Public position  In 2004, he became one of the founders of the opposition Committee 2008. In 2018, he was one of the trustees of Grigory Yavlinsky in the presidential election. He was one of the critics of the policy of the current authorities and President Vladimir Putin, and in his publications regularly criticized the programs of modern Russian television and their presenters. –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—ã. –ö–∞—Ä–∞- –ú—É—Ä–∑–∞-—Å—Ç.

It is Beck's first solo recording and has been described as \\"one of the great rock instrumentals, epic in scope, harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy\\". \\"Beck's Bolero\\" features a prominent melody with multiple guitar parts propelled by a rhythm inspired by Ravel's Bol√©ro. The recording session brought together a group of musicians, including Jimmy Page, Keith Moon, John Paul Jones, and Nicky Hopkins, who later agreed that the line up was a first attempt at what became Led Zeppelin. However, there is an ongoing disagreement over the composer as well as producer credits. Despite being credited solely to Page, Beck claims that he made significant contributions to the composition. Likewise, Page and Simon Napier-Bell each claim to have produced it, while Mickie Most received the credit. \\"Beck's Bolero\\" was not released until ten months after recording and then only as the B-side to Beck's first single. When it finally received greater exposure on Beck's debut album Truth in the latter part of 1968, it was still considered quite advanced even though it was over two years old. Beck continues to perform it and several renditions have been recorded by other musicians.  Background  The recording session for \\"Beck's Bolero\\" was conceived of as a side project for Jeff Beck while he was a member of the Yardbirds. \\"It was decided that it would be a good idea for me to record some of my own stuff ... partly to stop me moaning about the Yardbirds\\", Beck recalled. Also, the Yardbirds' management was encouraging individual band members to bring attention to the band through success in solo projects. Studio time was booked for May 1966 at the IBC Studios in London. To prepare for the session, Beck called on long-time friend and studio guitarist Jimmy Page, who had recommended Beck as Eric Clapton's replacement in the Yardbirds, to work up some ideas for songs to record. Although there is a disagreement over credits for the composition, both Beck and Page agree that Page began by playing some chords on a twelve-string guitar using a rhythm based on Bol√©ro. Bol√©ro is a one-movement orchestral piece composed by Maurice Ravel in 1928 and is \\"built on a persistent, repeating motif supported by a snare drum ... re-creating the Spanish 'bolero' dance pattern for full orchestra\\", according to Beck biographer Martin Power. A melody line for guitar was developed along with a middle section to break up the rhythm, reminiscent of the Yardbirds' arrangements for \\"For Your Love\\" and \\"Shapes of Things\\". With at least the outline of one song and Page on board to play guitar, Beck approached Keith Moon of the Who, whom he considered one of his favourite drummers. Moon was unhappy with the Who at the time and readily agreed to participate. To avoid a confrontation with Pete Townshend and Kit Lambert, the Who's manager, Moon wished to do so incognito. He recommended bandmate John Entwistle, who was similarly discontented with the Who, to provide the bass.  Recording  Jeff Beck at the Fillmore East, 1968 The recording session took place at IBC Studios on 16 and 17 May 1966 (although a date after Beck left the Yardbirds in November 1966 has also been suggested). Moon arrived at the studio disguised in sunglasses and a Russian cossack hat. When Entwistle did not show, studio musicians John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins were brought in at the last minute to provide bass and piano. There is an unsubstantiated account that Ritchie Blackmore may have been involved at the studio, but his participation has not been acknowledged by Beck, Page, or others at the session. Napier-Bell, the Yardbirds' producer who had originally promoted the idea, was present for the recording. For the guitar parts, Beck used a Gibson Les Paul played through a Vox AC30 amplifier and Page played a Fender Electric XII twelve-string electric guitar. Halfway through the song, Moon smashed the drum microphone with his stick ‚Äì \\"You can actually hear him screaming as he does it\\", Beck remembered, \\"so all you can hear from then on is cymbals!\\" After Moon and Napier-Bell left, Beck and Page added overdubs and sound treatments to complete the track. According to Beck, two or three songs were recorded at the session, but \\"Beck's Bolero\\" was the only track released.  Composition  \\"Beck's Bolero\\" is roughly divided into three parts. The first begins with a reworking of Ravel's two-chord progression, transposed to the key of A. Power points out that by using a 12-string guitar, Page is able to take advantage of the instrument's \\"rich chiming quality to emulate the distinct, orchestral 'bolero' sound\\". Beck then introduces the melody line on electric guitar with a fuzz-tone effect producing indefinite sustain; alternating between major and minor modes, it is described as \\"haunting\\" by Power and as a \\"distinctive piercing, sinister tone\\" by critic Richie Unterberger. In the second section, the piano, bass, and drums come in and the tension builds. Unterberger describes the third section as \\"suddenly set[ting] off from the main motif into a beautiful serene section highlighting slide- glissando guitars\\", with Beck's echo-laden slide sounding similar to a steel guitar. The fourth section returns to the main melody with overlaid drawn-out descending slide. According to Beck, \\"the phasing was Jimmy's idea ... I played a load of waffle and he reversed it\\". The tension mounts as Moon adds drum flourishes, climaxing with a break. The second part begins with Moon's simultaneous drum break and scream and launches in different, hard rock direction. \\"It was my idea to cut off in the middle, Yardbirds-style\\", Beck commented, \\"Keith upped the tempo and gave it an extra kick. It's like a bit of the Who, a bit of the Yardbirds and a bit of me\\". The amply-distorted guitar provides \\"a thick-toned, descending riff\\", according to Power. He also describes the break, inspired by the Yardbirds' rave-up technique, as \\"eerily presag[ing] the coming era of hard rock and heavy metal\\". The third part returns to the main motif with added guitar fills. The melody line is abandoned in the second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects, including phasing, echo, and controlled feedback. It concludes with a few bars of hard blues rock-style lead guitar and an abrupt ending.  Releases  Later Columbia single pressing with \\"J. Page\\" composer credit The record release of \\"Beck's Bolero\\" was delayed for ten months, when Jeff Beck began his solo career after leaving the Yardbirds. It appeared as the B-side of his first single, \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\", which was released on 10 March 1967 in the UK (Columbia DB 8151) and 3 April 1967 in the US (Epic 5‚Äì10157). The initial UK pressing of the single listed the title as \\"Bolero\\" with Jeff Beck as the composer, while later pressings showed \\"Beck's Bolero\\" and \\"J. Page\\". The single reached number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart, and number 123 in the US Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\" was ignored by American underground FM radio, but \\"Beck's Bolero\\" became a staple of the new radio format. In 1968, the instrumental gained wider exposure when it was included on the Jeff Beck Group debut album, Truth. Released in the US in July, the album reached number 15 in the Billboard 200 album chart one month later. Truth was issued in October in the UK, but it did not appear in the album charts. On the British monaural releases, \\"Beck's Bolero\\" has a fifteen-second backwards guitar coda. This version is included as a bonus track on the 2006 remastered Truth CD and on the Sundazed Records reissue of the original mono vinyl album. The original album liner notes do not list the personnel for \\"Beck's Bolero\\" ‚Äì Jones' and Hopkins' contributions are noted for other songs along with \\"Timpani by 'You Know Who'\\", the \\"Who\\" being Moon. \\"Beck's Bolero\\" remains one of Beck's favourites pieces and he has performed it numerous times, often as his opening number. A live version in 2008 appears on his Live at Ronnie Scott's album and video. On 4 April 2009, Page formally inducted Beck into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and together they performed \\"Beck's Bolero\\" at the induction ceremony, with Page playing the original 1965 Fender XII electric twelve-string guitar which he used for the 1966 recording session.  Disagreement over credits   Production  Beck's later producer, Mickie Most, the Yardbirds' producer, Simon Napier- Bell, and Jimmy Page have each claimed to be the recording's producer. At the time of the release of \\"Beck Bolero\\", Beck was under contract to producer Most. Although he was not involved in the recording, under the terms of the contract, Most received a \\"mandated production credit\\" and it is his name that appears on the single and album credits. Napier-Bell, who was at least present for the recording, has claimed that his involvement was substantial: However, according to Jimmy Page, \\"the track was done and then the producer, Simon Napier-Bell, just disappeared ... [he] just sort of left me and Jeff to do it. Jeff was playing and I was [at the recording console].\\" Page asserts that he in fact was the instrumental's actual producer.  Composition  The initial Columbia Records pressing of the single listed the title as \\"Bolero\\" and \\"Jeff Beck\\" as the composer. However, Jimmy Page filed for the composer credit for \\"Beck's Bolero\\" and it is his name that appears on the credits for all but the initial release. Nonetheless, Beck has claimed credit for his contributions to the composition. Both Beck and Page agree that Page came up with the Bol√©ro-influenced chords and rhythm. However, Beck specifically claims that key features of the instrumental‚Äîthe haunting melody line and the second part \\"hard-rock\\" break‚Äîare his. Beck adds that the break contains \\"the first heavy metal riff ever written and I wrote it\\". While not addressing the specifics, Page asserts \\"I wrote it, played on it, produced it ... and I don't give a damn what [Jeff] says. That's the truth\\", but adds \\"the slide bits are his\\". Beck later put it behind him, \\"No, I didn't get a songwriting credit, but you win some and lose some down the years\\". Over the years, he and Page have made several appearances together in concerts and for interviews.  Legacy  Beck, Page, Hopkins, Jones, and Moon were pleased with the outcome of the recording session and there was talk of forming a working group and additional recordings. This led to the famous quip, \\"Yeah, it'll go down like a lead zeppelin\\", which Page later used, with a slight spelling change, for his new group. Page ascribed it to Moon, while Beck's and Led Zeppelin's later manager Peter Grant claimed Moon used the phrase \\"go down like a lead balloon\\", to which Entwistle added \\"more like a lead zeppelin\\". Group biographer Keith Shadwick notes that forming an actual group at the time \\"was never a realistic option\\", due to existing contractual obligations. Keith Moon backstage in Germany, 1967 For all their attempts at secrecy, Townshend learned of Moon's move. Beck recalled, \\"I remember [Pete] Townshend looking daggers at me when he heard it ... because it was a bit near the mark. He didn't want anybody meddling with that territory [his band, the Who] at all\\". Townshend also took to referring to Beck and Page as \\"flashy little guitarists of very little brain\\" for their perceived subterfuge (Page responded with \\"Townshend got into feedback because he couldn't play single notes\\"). In a later interview, Townshend explained Differences with Moon were resolved and he returned to the Who shortly after the recording. One month later, Page joined the Yardbirds and together with Beck became one of the first dual-lead guitar teams in popular rock. In 1968, Hopkins became a member of the Jeff Beck Group and for performances of \\"Beck's Bolero\\" during their first US tour in June, singer Rod Stewart played the rhythm guitar part. Also in 1968, Page started Led Zeppelin with Jones. Page incorporated some of the melody line and bolero rhythm into the medley portion of \\"How Many More Times\\" for the Led Zeppelin debut album. \\"Beck's Bolero\\" appears on various \\"best of\\" lists and in Guitar Masters: Intimate Portraits, Alan di Perna describes it as \\"one of the great rock instrumentals, epic in scope, harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy\\". The May 1966 recording pre-dated other mid-1960s hard rock/psychedelic rock milestones, such as the formation of Cream, Jimi Hendrix's arrival in England, the Beatles' Revolver album, and the rise of the San Francisco Sound. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield recalled that \\"Beck's Bolero\\" had a \\"significant impact on Jimi Hendrix, who named it among his favorite tracks\\". Beck recalled performing a live version with Hendrix on lead guitar, but a recording has not been forthcoming. According to Paul Hornsby, who played with Duane Allman in Hour Glass in 1967‚Äì1968 before the Allman Brothers Band, \\"Beck's Bolero\\" inspired Allman to take up slide guitar. After hearing Beck's record, Allman \\"loved that slide part and told me he was going to learn to play it\\", Hornsby recalled. In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of \\"Beck's Bolero\\" for a James Gang song. Titled \\"The Bomber\\", the multi-part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel's Bol√©ro and appears on the James Gang Rides Again album. Several artists have recorded renditions of \\"Beck's Bolero\\", including SRC, the Posies, Les Fradkin, Eric Johnson, and Return to Forever.

In his \\"cup of coffee\\" big league career, Carre√±o had a 0‚Äì0 record, with two strikeouts, and a 16.20 earned run average (ERA), in innings pitched. Career Carre√±o started his professional career with the New York Yankees, who signed him as an amateur free agent in 1983. He spent the 1984 season with the GCL Yankees, the minor league rookie affiliate of the Yankees. He pitched in nine games and started in seven of them, winning one game, losing six, and finishing with an ERA of 4.91. He pitched in one game the following season, and in 1986 split time between the GCL and Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League. After seven games with GCL, going 5‚Äì0 with a 1.70 ERA, Carre√±o was promoted to Fort Lauderdale, where he pitched in three games, winning one and losing one. In 1987, Carre√±o pitched for three teams in the Yankees organization: the Prince William Yankees, the Albany-Colonie Yankees, and the Columbus Clippers. He spent the first part of the season with Prince William, then was promoted to Columbus, where his outings included two shutout innings at the AAA level. After 11 appearances with Columbus, he was sent back to Prince William, pitching a complete game in his return appearance. He finished his time at Prince William with a 5‚Äì2 record and a 3.03 ERA. Late in the season, he was promoted to Albany-Colonie and spent the rest of the season there. In November, the Yankees purchased Carre√±o's contract and placed him on the 40-man roster. At the start of the 1988 season, the Yankees signed Carre√±o to a one-year contract and invited him to spring training. After pitching with the Yankees in March, he was sent along with Clay Parker to Albany-Colonie. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on July 15, 1988, for Luis Aguayo.

As the primary custodian of the teachings of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Dilgo Khyentse was the de facto custodian of the vast majority of Tibetan Buddhist teachings. He taught many eminent teachers, including the Dalai Lama. After the Chinese invasion of Tibet, his personal effort was crucial in the preservation of Tibetan Buddhism. Biography Early life, ancestry He was born in 1910 in the Denhok Valley at Kham Derge, Eastern Tibet, to a family directly descended from the ninth-century King Trisong Detsen. His father was a minister to the King of Derge. When he was seven years old, he was publicly recognized as one of the reincarnations of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo by Shechen Gyaltsap Rinpoche (1871‚Äì1926) at Shechen, one of the six principal monasteries of the Nyingmapa school. During the next few years Dilgo Khyentse received full schooling from various tutors, in addition to training in meditation, and in the study of the dharma in general, and of tantra specifically. His root guru was Shechen Gyaltsap Rinpoche, and Dzongsar Khyentse Chokyi Lodro (1893‚Äì1959) was his other main spiritual master. After he completed what is known as the Preliminary Practices (Ng√∂ndro), Khyentse spent most of the next 13 years in silent retreat in remote hermitages and caves near his birthplace. He married Khandro Lhamo, a woman from a modest family, after he became ill following an austere retreat. His teacher had prophesied that a cure for his illness would be marriage, despite the fact he was uninterested in it. Lhamo became a well- known expert in Tibetan medicine, a supporter of Shechen Monastery and his life-long companion. Buddhist studies After completing his retreat at the age of 28, Khyentse spent many years with Dzongsar Khyentse Chokyi Lodro. After receiving from Khyentse Chokyi Lodro the many empowerments of the Rinchen Terdzo (the collection of Revealed Treasures or termas), Dilgo Khyentse requested to spend the rest of his life in solitary meditation. But Khyentse Chokyi Lodro answered, \\"The time has come for you to teach and transmit to others the countless precious teachings you have received.\\" Additionally he received teachings at Palpung Monastery from the 11th Tai Situ Rinpoche, and full instruction on the ancient Guhyagarbha Tantra and its various commentaries from Khenpo Tubga at Kyangma Ri-tro. In all he studied with over 50 teachers from the various oral and practice lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. Later on, the Dalai Lama regarded Dilgo Khyentse as his principal teacher in the Nyingma tradition and of Dzogchen. Khyentse was also one of the main teachers of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, whom he held in high regard, Move to Tibet, teachings In the 1950s, as rebellions broke out in Kham in response to the imposition of Chinese Communist rule, Khyentse and his family escaped to central Tibet, leaving behind his library of dharma books and most of his own writings. Then in 1959, after the 14th Dalai Lama left Tibet, Khyentse, his family and a few disciples left Tibet, including his brother, the 9th Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche and Tenga Rinpoche, and headed for Bhutan. The royal family of Bhutan invited him to stay there and teach. Later, as he made frequent visits to give teachings to the 14th Dalai Lama at Dharamasala in India, he began giving teachings all over the Himalayas, India, Southeast Asia and the West. He also engaged in scholarship and composed numerous poems, meditation texts and commentaries. He was a terton (a discoverer of spiritual treasures) and was considered to have discovered numerous termas. He was one of the leading masters of the pith-instructions of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, and one of the principal holders of the Longchen Nyingtik tradition. In 1980, he founded the Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling Monastery in Nepal, where he transplanted the Shechen tradition to a new home near the great stupa of Boudhanath, just northeast of Kathmandu. There he gave many teachings over the years to hundreds of other lamas, disciples, and students from around the world. Over this same period, and until his paranirvana in 1991, Khyentse was involved in publishing as many Tibetan Buddhist teachings as possible, over 300 volumes altogether. Final years He was one of the few Tibetan Lamas accorded the honorific title \\"His Holiness\\". Following the death of Dudjom Rinpoche in 1987, he became the head of the Nyingma School, and remained so until his death in Bhutan on 28 September 1991. Student Matthieu Ricard remarked Final cremation ceremonies were held for him over a three-day period near Paro in Bhutan, in November 1992 and were attended by over 100 lamas, the Royal Family and ministers of Bhutan, 500 western disciples and 50,000 devotees. Preservation of lineages Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche in Seattle, 1976 Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was a perfect example of a Ri-me master. He was instrumental in safeguarding all of the lineages of Tibetan Buddhism without partiality. He received and gave empowerments, wrote volumes of texts that revitalized and interpreted important transmission teachings.Brilliant Moon, forward by Sogyal Rinpoche, Shambala Boston and London 2009 p. xxxvi Gyatrul (b. 1924),Source: (accessed: Wednesday March 25, 2009) in a purport to Karma Chagm√© (, fl. 17th century), conveys Khyentse's 'samaya' (Sanskrit), diligence and humility in receiving 'wang' (Tibetan), lineal transmission and 'rlung' (Wylie) as rendered into English by B.

It was made by Matthieu Ricard (French photographer, Buddhist monk, and author) who had traveled with Khyentse for 14 years. It tells Khyentse's story from birth to death, to rebirth, and of his escape following China's invasion of Tibet to his determination to preserve and transmit Buddhist teachings far and wide. The film reveals Tibet's art, ritual philosophy, and sacred dance. Along with rarely photographed areas of Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal, the film features interviews with the Dalai Lama, who speaks about his own spiritual life. The film Brilliant Moon: Glimpses of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, written and directed by Neten Chokling, and narrated by Richard Gere and Lou Reed, uses animation, previously unseen archival footage and photos along with new interviews of Tibet's teachers to tell Khyentse's life story.

It was developed in the 1920s, but many of its elegant mansions have been turned into apartments, and many new multiple-occupancy buildings have been constructed. Westlake is a high-density area, with a young and heavily Latino population. It contains many primary and secondary schools. History Early development In 1887, Westlake was referred to as the \\"southwest quarter\\" of Los Angeles. The Westlake hills were already \\"dotted with fine residences, and it is plainly to be seen that the development of this quarter is in its infancy. The Bonnie Brae, Westlake Park and other tracts in the neighborhood have been almost wholly disposed of by the subdividers, and many of the lots have passed into second and third hands, at advancing prices. The Baptist College, now well under way, looms up to the northward.\\" The neighborhood was named for Westlake Park, the land for which had been donated by Henricus Wallace Westlake, a Canadian physician who moved to Los Angeles around 1888. He built his house on Burlington Avenue in the district that later bore his name; the residence was the first to rise in the rolling hills west of the more settled and built-up part of the town. Looking southeast along Wilshire from Lafayette Park, 1945 One of the first areas of Los Angeles west of Figueroa Street to see residential development, Westlake came to have a significant Jewish population. Wealthy businessmen commuted to downtown, Wilshire Center (now Koreatown), Hollywood, and the Miracle Mile from the district's Spanish Revival and Art Deco mansions. Around the 1940s the district's northwestern blocks fringed the home of Los Angeles' early working class Filipino population who were shifted from what is today Little Tokyo and Bunker Hill, some of which remain in parts of Westlake and nearby neighborhoods like Echo Park, Silver Lake, and East Hollywood. Oil exploitation In 1899 newly drilled oil wells in the area, with their unsightly derricks, were said to cause pollution and runoff in the streets \\"at every hard rain,\\" and residents of the neighborhood were \\"indignant that nothing was done for their relief.\\" The city had declared a 1,600-foot zone around Westlake Park where drilling was forbidden (later modified to 1,000 feet), but the legality of that ordinance was under attack by oilmen such as W.E. de Groot. Even City Attorney Walter F. Haas thought the law was invalid, although he had to defend it as part of his duty. Nevertheless, a Superior Court judge, in the case of People v. Richard Green and others, held the city law to be valid. By 1900, however, it was found that oil production in Westlake had been, in effect, \\"pumped dry,\\" and the situation ceased to make news. Proposed factory district Residents were alarmed in May 1919 by a petition being circulated by entrepreneur Arthur Evans to build a \\"high- class,\\" six-story building on the southwest corner of Westlake Avenue and Orange Street \\"for the manufacture of women's apparel.\\" Supposedly having the backing of 85% of property owners adjoining the site in the affected Lazard tract, the promoters said they wanted to build in the Lakewood District because they could not get the kind of women workers they sought if they built in the city's industrial district, with its associated smoke and dust. They promised the employment of 1,000 workers, mostly women, as well as a school to teach \\"the finer grades of needlework\\" and a permanent exhibition space devoted to showing how garments are made. A \\"mammoth petition of protest\\" was presented to a City Council committee on June 12 by a throng of opponents and the applicant, identified and the Brownstein-Lewis Company, withdrew the plan and never resubmitted it. Notable construction Residential Sketch of apartment building on the northwest corner of Sixth and Lake, 1915. It later became the Hotel Ansonia * Hotel, 1901. A five-story hotel was planned for the southeastern corner of Sixth and Alvarado, across from Westlake Park, with John Parkinson as the architect. There were to be 300 guest rooms, as well as \\"public and private dining-rooms, kitchen, ladies' billiard room, office, ball-room and the many business accessories of a first-class tourist hotel.\\" * Hotel, 1902. Ground was broken at Sixth and San Joaquin (today's Lake Street) for a four-story hotel with Mission architecture designed by A.L. Haley and George Black on the northwest corner, opposite the park. \\"The house will be so arranged that all guests' rooms will be outside, and it will have hydraulic elevators, a ballroom with stage, and the usual billiard-rooms, bathrooms, dining-rooms, kitchens and servants' quarters. For the latter there will also be provided a separate, detached building that will contain forty-eight rooms.\\" * Apartment building, 1915. A seven-story structure at Sixth and Lake was designed by John Parkinson for owner James H. Edmonds and featured a ladies' parlor, a billiard and card room and a 40-by-70-foot ballroom. There were 32 four-room and eight three-room suites. \\"All bedrooms will be arranged for open beds instead of the customary wall beds. . . . A refrigeration system designed to cool all the ice boxes in the various apartments from a central plant in the basement will be a feature.\\" It later became the Hotel Ansonia. * Hotel Californian, 1925. The spacious hotel on the northwest corner of Sixth and Bonnie Brae, with its \\"baths and showers, double closets and radio communications,\\" was opened with elaborate entertainment and ceremonies on April 1. \\"A novel arrangements of doors can operate to divide the building into quarters, as an extra precaution against fires. . . . The main lobby itself is done in antique wood effect, polychromed and picked in with dulled- off primary colors, and carefully highlighted with gold leaf. The fixture are hand-wrought ornamental iron, while beautiful tapestries and pictures on the walls add the finishing touches.\\"[6] The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1961 (see Notable fires, below). * Hotel Arcady and Wilshire Royale, 1927. The 12-story hotel was launched in January 1927 on the northeast corner of Wilshire and Rampart boulevards at a cost of $2.25 million, of which bonds of $1.325 million were purchased by S.W. Strauss and Company. Designed by architects Walter & Elsen, the building, constructed for Olive Phillips, housed two- to four-room suites. The completed hotel was to be operated by Fletcher & Lilly, who were already running the nearby Gaylord Apartments. In 1953 the hotel was bought by Fifield Manor, a nonprofit corporation, to become a senior residence. Mrs. Helen Ramsay Fifield was listed as the president. The name of the 193-unit Beaux-Arts building was changed to Wilshire Royale, and it was purchased in 2015 by MWest Holdings for $32.5 million in 2015. * Apartment project, 2010. The MacArthur Park Metro Apartments, a $45 million joint venture between Metro and the Los Angeles Housing Partnership, among others. broke ground. It was to include affordable-housing units and some 30,000 square feet of retail space. Other Masonic California Grand Master Benjamin F. Bledsoe (foreground), with the cornerstone for a new lodge building in 1913, as William R. Hervey and Champ S. Vance watch * Masonic Lodge, 1914. Oliver F. Dennis and Henry Harwood Hewitt were the architects for a $30,000 building erected on the southwest corner of Eighth and Burlington by the Westlake Masonic Association, with the ground floor given over to space for seven or eight retail shops and the second floor for the lodge headquarters, lodge hall finished in Philippine mahogany and banquet hall finished in white enamel. * Elks Lodge, 1924. Plans for a magnificent, $1.5 million. seven-story Elks Lodge on the southwest corner of Sixth and Park View streets, with an entrance on Carondelet Street, were announced in March 1924. It was to consist of a lodge room with seating capacity for 1,500 people, a ballroom with a stage area for presentations and a gymnasium. On the fourth floor were to be a grill, billiard and card rooms, seven private dining rooms, directors' rooms and a band and glee club hall. There were to be 175 hotel rooms, and in the basement were planned six bowling alleys and a swimming pool. There was a 350-car garage with ten handball courts on the roof. Two roof gardens were planned. Architects were Curlett & Beelman. The structure was sold by the Elks and is now the Park Plaza Hotel (Los Angeles) at 607 South Park View. Change Economy and lifestyle In its early years, Westlake was considered one of the most desirable residential areas in the city ‚Äì \\"the new gathering place for the city's carriage trade,\\" as one observer recalled in 1997. With time, though, as another put it, \\"The white gentry fled to Encino and Westwood, leaving their ghost buildings behind them.\\"Robert A. Jones, \\"Tempus Fugit,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 26, 1997, page 2 In the 1980s the neighborhood was infused with refugees from Central American countries like El Salvador, where a civil war had displaced a million people. In time, young Salvadorans formed a gang called Mara Salvatrucha, meaning, roughly, Gang of the Salvadoran Guy; for short, it was labeled MS-13. In time, the gang had spread to 33 other states and five countries. By 1990 Westlake had become a grim area \\"where heroin addicts and youthful gang members control the public alleyways and clamber across people's rooftops to elude police.\\" An alley had become a refuge for the homeless, with no toilets, and piles of garbage were accumulating.Jill Stewart, \\"Landlord Fights Back: He Has Tenants on His Side in Battling Anti-Slum Charges,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 28, 1990, page 1 The neighborhood was replete with sidewalk vendors in 1993, from whom sometimes gang members, called cholos, were demanding \\"rent\\" to use the public sidewalks, which were bustling with refugees from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and other Latin American countries. It was said that trepidation, or fear, was \\"the price of living and working in the Westlake district.\\" People lived on the underground economy, strictly cash, and the district was infested with \\"some of the city's largest and most menacing street gangs,\\" with police and residents complaining of drug dealing, prostitution, thievery and extortion. Yet there was an air of economic energy and potential, with the vast majority of the residents just wanting to make an honest living. Just 17 years later, though, crime had dropped and Westlake was on a road to gentrification. As rentals and property values in Downtown Los Angeles and nearby Koreatown rose, artists and other creative people moved into Westlake. \\"Swanky nightclubs, organic tamale co-ops and art galleries\\" followed. The change was traced to intensive anti-crime and cleanup efforts in MacArthur Park, particularly since the installation of surveillance cameras in 2004. A business improvement district was formed. In January 2012, the city launched a campaign under a new city ordinance dealing with illegal street vendors throughout Los Angeles, but with principal effect in Westlake and the Venice neighborhood. The ordinance outlawed the sale of items with \\"utilitarian value,\\" like socks and T-shirts but allowed vendors to sell art objects. A city-sponsored weekend market was set up, which required vendors to undergo training and licensing. Housing In 1990 a jury convicted a landlord of 23 counts of having slum conditions at a building he owned at 737 South Westlake Avenue in Los Angeles. Devanand Sharma failed to provide tenants with heat, did not repair broken windows, fire doors and smoke detectors, and kept walls, ceilings and plumbing in a deteriorated condition. His brother was dubbed the city's \\"worst slumlord\\" after a 1987 conviction for slum conditions and had been a fugitive for two years. In 1993, in the wake of a deadly fire at 330 South Burlington Avenue (see Notable fires, below), major reforms proposed to help avert similar tragedies had not been implemented, and serious fire safety violations persisted in the Westlake and Pico-Union areas. Plans for new fees, a fire inspection task force and a computerized record- keeping system were stalled. But fire officials said that budget constraints and the city bureaucracy thwarted their plans. Nevertheless, in that year an appeals court said that a trial could go ahead against Highland Federal Bank, even though it was not an actual owner; it was accused of operating a network of slum buildings in Los Angeles, for one of which, the Cameo Hotel at 504 South Bonnie Brae Street in Westlake, the owner was listed as \\"Teluce Black,\\" a Labrador retriever. That decision set a statewide precedent. Authorities alleged the bank knowingly helped finance purchases in Westlake, Echo Park, Hollywood, South-Central, Koreatown and Pico-Union by buyers who had no means and no intention of keeping the structures in repair. Slum conditions were cleaned up after the suit was filed, and, in a 1996 settlement, the bank agreed to pay US$1.4 million to tenants, to the city and to public-interest attorneys. In 1999 Judge Leland Harris sentenced another landlord, Ronald J. Olenczuk, to live in a room on the fifth floor of his own six-story, 96-unit building at 744 South Beacon Avenue The owner had to remain there from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. for 45 consecutive days. During the other hours he was allowed to supervise repairs to the building. The landlord had been found guilty of 12 code violations on the building, including broken fire doors, fire escape drop-ladders that did not work, blocked fire-sprinkler controls, broken windows, broken and missing smoke detectors and exposed live electrical wiring. He had to pay US$1,774 in fines and perform 100 hours of community service. Other legal action followed against other slum building owners. Geography Multiple sources outline different boundaries for Westlake. The City of Los Angeles The City of Los Angeles' Westlake Community Plan shows the Westlake boundaries as: Temple Street on the north, the Harbor Freeway on the east, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south, Washington Boulevard on the southwest and an irregular line along Hoover Street on the west. Mapping L.A. Project According to the Los Angeles Times' Mapping L.A. project, the street boundaries of Westlake are: the Hollywood Freeway on the north, Glendale Boulevard and Second Street on the east, Beaudry Avenue and the Harbor Freeway on the southeast, West Olympic Boulevard on the southeast and south, Westmoreland Avenue, Wilshire Place and Virgil Avenue on the west, and Temple Street and Hoover Street on the northwest. Westlake is flanked by Silver Lake to the north, Echo Park to the northeast and east, Downtown to the southeast, Pico-Union to the south and southwest and Koreatown to the west. Westlake touches East Hollywood on the northwest. Google Maps Mapping L.A. boundaries for Westlake Google Maps draws the following boundaries for Westlake: The Hollywood Freeway on the north, the Harbor Freeway and Lucas Street on the east, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south. The boundary on the west is Hoover Street to Wilshire Boulevard, and Virgil Avenue to the Hollywood Freeway. Demographics The 2000 U.S. census counted 108,839 residents in the 2.72-square-mile neighborhood‚Äîan average of 38,214 people per square mile, the second-highest density of any community in Los Angeles County, after Koreatown. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 117,756. It was estimated in 1993 that 85,000 people lived within a mile of the Alvarado/MacArthur Park Red Line station and that the density of this neighborhood rivaled that of Manhattan in New York City. Another report the same year said that at 147 people per acre Westlake had four times the average density of Manhattan and that \\"The vast majority of units are occupied by more than one family. Firefighters often find babies sleeping in dresser drawers, and children in closets that serve as their bedrooms.\\" Nevertheless, census takers found that the average household size of three people was about the same as the rest of the city. Renters occupied 94.9% of the housing units, and house or apartment owners just 5.1% Heavily Latino, Westlake was considered \\"not especially diverse\\" ethnically. The breakdown was Latinos, 73.4%; Asians, 16.5%; whites, 4.5%; blacks, 3.9%, and others, 1.7%. Mexico (36.8%) and El Salvador (17.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 67.6% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high compared to the city as a whole. The median age for residents was 27, considered young for both the city and the county. The median household income in 2008 dollars was $26,757, a low figure for Los Angeles, and a high percentage of households earned $20,000 or less. The percentages of never-married men and women, 47% and 36.4%, respectively, were among the county's highest. The 2000 census found 5,325 families headed by single parents, a high rate for both the city and the county. There were 2,591 military veterans in 2000, or 3.5%, a low figure for Los Angeles. Transportation Station sign for Metro underground, 2015 Public transportation in Westlake was first proposed in 1887 by railroad entrepreneurs Herman Silver and J.F.Crank as a double-track street cable railroad with the western terminus at Seventh and Alvarado streets and the eastern at \\"the proposed union depot of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company near the western extremity of the First Street Bridge,\\" later amended to continue the road along First Street to Aliso Avenue and Chicago Street. In return for the franchise, the two men offered to donate $10,000 to the city. The railway ran to the southeastern corner of Westlake Park. There is now a Westlake/MacArthur Park station of the Los Angeles County Metro Rail System whose entrance is across Alvarado Street from MacArthur Park. Emergency services Police Division headquarters Rampart Division, LAPD, 2008 Westlake is patrolled by the Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department, 1401 West 6th Street at Valencia Street, within the Westlake neighborhood. Notable crimes 1906\\\\. On August 16, 1906, Annie Sanderson, 45, was slashed to death by her husband, Edward H. Sanderson, president of the California Truck Company, in their residence at 1336 Westlake Avenue. He then committed suicide by cutting his throat with the same knife. Westlake crime: front page of Los Angeles Herald for August 14, 1908 1908\\\\. Wielding a sharpened ax, Henry J. Dufty, 56, slew his sleeping 24-year-old son, Fred Dufty, a machinist, in the son's bungalow at 247 North Mountain View Avenue on August 13, then walked uphill to nearby 453 North Westlake Avenue, where he used the same instrument to decapitate his pregnant daughter, Zaidah La Com. He returned to his home, where he cut his own throat, attempting suicide. He had previously purchased gravestones for himself and his two children, which had already been laid at Evergreen Cemetery. A jury trial resulted in a verdict of insanity. 1922\\\\. On February 2, the body of motion picture director William Desmond Taylor was found on the floor of the living room of his bungalow at 404 Alvarado Street. He had been shot. The killer was never found. 1948\\\\. Joyce Corbley or Corbly, age given as either 22 or 38, died after shooting herself in the head on June 26 when she played a game of Russian roulette in a room at the Ansonia Apartments, 2205 West Sixth Street. 1996\\\\. On March 29, Linda Morimoto, a noted physician of the Japanese American community, was found bludgeoned to death on the floor of her ransacked home in the 400 block of Lafayette Park Place. No arrests were made. 2010\\\\. Two nights of violent protests troubled the Westlake neighborhood after a policeman fatally shot Manuel Jaminez, a Guatemalan construction worker who spoke no English and very little Spanish, at Sixth Street and Union Avenue on September 5. Police said Jaminez had threatened a woman with a knife, which he refused to drop. 2010\\\\. The mummified remains of a still-born baby and an infant, brother and sister, were discovered in August, wrapped in newspapers from the 1930s and hidden inside a trunk in the basement of an apartment building near MacArthur Park. They were identified as the children of Janet Mann Barrie, who had lived in the building and who died in Canada at age 97 in 1994. 2012\\\\. Pedro Martinez, a 26-year-old gang member, was sentenced to 100 years to life in prison for killing Andres Ordonez, 25, a church deacon who was trying to stop a woman from spray-painting, or tagging, an outside wall at Iglesia Principe de Paz Church on Beverly Boulevard. Ordonez was slain on November 4, 2012, when he and a fellow parishioner exited the church to stop the woman's vandalism; Martinez stepped from a nearby vehicle and opened fire, killing one and wounding the other. Nearby residents said that gang members had threatened violence against those who complained about or painted over graffiti. The woman was arrested and faces trial. Fire service Engine company LAFD Rescue 11 on Alvarado Street, with sidewalk merchants in the background, 2015 LAFD Engine 11, with the Westlake Theatre in the background, 2015 Los Angeles Fire Department Station 11 serves the area. In 1993 it was said to be one of the busiest fire stations in the country. Notable fires Hotel Coronado, 1905. An early-morning fire destroyed the massive and popular Hotel Coronado at 667 Coronado Street on December 4, 1905, after a delay in communicating by telephone with the fire department. The blaze spread rapidly, and more than eighty guests had to flee, some in their nightclothes. Sarah and Helen Mathewson were lessees of the hotel, which was owned by M.N. Russ Avery and Superior Judge Walter Bordwell. The tourist hotel was one of the most expensive in the city, \\"being patronized by wealthy persons to whom the cost was not a consideration.\\" By the time firefighters led by Chief Walter Lips arrived about an hour after the blaze was discovered, the hotel was already in ruins, and the men turned their efforts to saving nearby buildings. Close by were \\"scores of mansions, some of them among the finest in the city. Sparks dropping on the dry roofs . . . caused small blazes in many places. The occupants of the buildings in danger succeeded in extinguishing the blazing embers . . . . The costly furnishings of a number of fine houses were removed to places of safety outside the zone of danger,\\" and neighbors gave shelter to hotel guests who had fled. The Mathewson sisters were overcome by smoke, but they survived; their pet dog died. Helen Mathewson later asserted charges of negligence against Chief Lips, which he denied. Hotel Californian, 1961‚Äì1994. Flames engulfed the upper two floors of the five-story Hotel Californian at 1907 West Sixth Street on August 2, 1961. Firemen were threatened with injury when a water hydrant burst and a hose flailed about viciously before water was turned off. Scores of television aerials on the roof of the hotel hampered the men before the flames were brought under control. The hotel reopened, but became \\"a classic slum building where a changing cast of owners suck out profits, fail to make repairs and leve tenants in miserable conditions.\\" City officials closed its entrances with plywood and metal bars, but homeless people broke through and made it their home. On November 21, 1994, it took 186 firefighters from three companies to quell a massive blaze that all but destroyed the place. Finally, the City Council ordered the old hotel razed as an irreparable hazard. Burlington Avenue, 1993. Nine people, mostly immigrants from Latin America, and two fetuses died as a result of a fire that ravaged an apartment building at 330 Burlington Avenue on May 5. More than forty were injured. Some residents escaped by jumping from or, in the case of children, being thrown from upper floors into the arms of rescuers, but others died when they were trapped on stairways. Members of the 18th Street Gang joined in the rescue effort. More than a hundred shocked survivors were given emergency shelter in the Belmont High School gymnasium. It was the fourth-deadliest fire in the city's history. Fire officials said the owners failed to correct a faulty alarm system, amid other fire code violations. Some fire doors had been illegally propped open. Church of the Immaculate Conception in Westlake Four hundred mourners were at a special eulogy at the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Ninth Street (later James M. Wood Boulevard) in Westlake, where Cardinal Roger M. Mahony called upon city authorities to work toward improving apartment safety. Among the mourners were elementary school classmates of two of the dead children and a Fire Department honor guard of about two dozen firefighters, dressed in formal black uniforms. In all, the caskets at the funeral Mass contained the remains of 11, including three mothers (two of them pregnant), two fetuses and six children. The two fetuses were placed with their mothers in the caskets. A 15-month-old child of Guatemalan parents was buried earlier in Calvary Cemetery. The other remains were returned to Mexico and Guatemala. In 1998, prosecutors filed charges against two men in the crime, alleging they were members of the 18th Street Gang who were attempting to intimidate an apartment manager who had tried to drive away drug dealers from the place. The charges were dropped after two years for lack of evidence.Cindy Chang, Richard Winton and Ben Welsh, \\"After 24 Years, Arrests Made in L.A. Fire That Killed 10, Including 7 Children,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 4, 2017 In February 2017, police arrested \\"multiple people\\" in connection with the arson. Joseph Monge, 44, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in February 2020 and was to be sentenced to 11 years in prison. Others under arrest and facing trial were Johanna Lopez and Ramiro \\"Greedy\\" Valerio.James Queally, \\"Guilty Plea in Deadly 1993 Arson,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 9, 2020, Page B4 McKinley House, 1994. After years of neglect and controversy, this boarded-up historic monument at Third Street and LaFayette Park Place finally succumbed when flames took the remains of what had been an elegant Italian Renaissance-style home overlooking Rampart Boulevard. Two transients were found dead when firemen were able to inspect the ruins. The 20-room house was built in 1915 by an Ohio millionaire who lived in it during the winter. Other families had it, too, until mortuary owner Maytor McKinley bought it in 1945. He died in 1970, and his widow, Vari Komp McKinley, lived there until her death in the mid-1980s. In 1987 developers purchased it with the intent of raising a 118-unit apartment complex on it. At the prodding of the Los Angeles Conservancy, the city declared it to be a cultural-historic monument. Rod and Sherry Daniels, intrigued by the idea of owning the beautiful old structure, bought it for $1 with the intention of moving it to Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley. Over six years those plans stagnated and the property kept deteriorating until the 1994 blaze put an end to the Daniels' dream and the house as a historic structure. Neighborhood residents launched a drive to turn the rubble-strewn lot into a neighborhood park; today the site is home to a privately owned school called the Lafayette Park Primary Center.

This gift is used in conjunction with that of the gift of tongues‚Äîthe supernatural ability to speak in a language (tongue) unknown to the speaker. The gift of interpretation is the supernatural enablement to express in an intelligible language an utterance spoken in an unknown tongue. This is not learned but imparted by the Holy Spirit; therefore, it should not be confused with the acquired skill of language interpretation. While cessationist Christians believe this miraculous charism has ceased, Charismatic and Pentecostal Christians believe this gift continues to operate within the church.Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, Foundations of Pentecostal Theology, 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), pp. 342-343. Biblical description Much of what is known about this gift was recorded by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 14. In this passage, guidelines for the proper use of the gift of tongues were given. In order for the gift of tongues to be beneficial to the edification of the church, such supernatural utterances were to be interpreted into the language of the gathered Christians. If no one among the gathered Christians possessed the gift of interpretation, then the gift of tongues was not to be publicly exercised. Those possessing the gift of tongues were encouraged to pray for the ability to interpret.

D. James and of a TV series of four dramas developed from that novel. It features private detective Cordelia Gray, the protagonist of both this title and The Skull Beneath the Skin. Cordelia inherited a detective agency and from there took on her first case. Plot summary Young private detective Cordelia Gray walks into the London office she shares with former police detective Bernie Pryde to find her partner has committed suicide. Pryde has left everything, including his unlicensed handgun, to Cordelia, who keeps the failing agency open out of gratitude. When she returns to her office from the funeral service, she is visited by her first client, Elizabeth Leaming, assistant to prominent scientist Sir Ronald Callender, whose son Mark recently died in suspicious circumstances. Cordelia travels to Cambridge, where Mark had left university despite decent grades and the prospect of a considerable inheritance from his maternal grandfather. She meets Mark's friends, who are reluctant to talk and attempt to convince her that Mark's death was a suicide, as the police investigation had determined. Cordelia decides to move into the rundown cottage on the estate where Mark had taken a gardening job. As she sifts through Mark's effects, trying to get a clearer picture of his life, she becomes ever more convinced that his death could not have been suicide. Repeatedly, Mark's friends try to lead her away from the investigation but Cordelia is determined to succeed in her first solo case. Returning to the cottage one night and finding an effigy hanging from the same hook on which Mark's body had been suspended only convinces her that foul play was involved. She finds out that a certain Nanny Pilbeam, formerly nanny to Mark's mother, had attended Mark's cremation and goes to question her. The old woman tells Cordelia that she went to see Mark in his college and gave him a Book of Common Prayer that his mother had wanted him to have when he turned 21. Cordelia finds the book in the cottage, discovering in it evidence that Lady Callender could not have been Mark's mother. Returning to the cottage the following night, someone attacks Cordelia, throws her down a well, and replaces the cover. She is saved by a combination of her own resourcefulness and the good luck that the cottage owner notices the well has been tampered with. Cordelia in turn lies in wait with Bernie's gun in order to ambush her would-be killer, who turns out to be Sir Ronald's laboratory assistant. However, he escapes in his van, only to die in a collision with a truck. Certain now of her case, Cordelia continues to Sir Ronald's house, where Miss Leaming takes her gun from her and leads her to Sir Ronald. Cordelia privately accuses him of the murder of his son, which he eventually admits, sure that nothing can be proved against him. Miss Leaming, however, who has overheard him, enters the office and shoots him with Cordelia's gun. Miss Leaming confesses to Cordelia that she was Mark's true mother but was prevented from telling him by Sir Ronald. Lady Callender had been infertile and died shortly after Mark's birth. Sir Ronald had murdered Mark when he was close to discovering the truth, so as not to lose his wife's fortune. Cordelia sympathises with Miss Leaming and the two rearrange the crime scene to look like yet another suicide. The case, however, is referred to Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh, who had originally commanded Bernie Pryde and then sacked him. Word arrives during their interview that Leaming has been killed in a car crash, allowing Cordelia to maintain the fiction they concocted together. Pryde is vindicated posthumously, as Dalgliesh admits to Cordelia, based on his observation of her abilities, that she has been well- trained. In private conference with his superiors, Dalgliesh believes he has worked out the true facts of the case, but says there is little point in disturbing the official story, since everyone involved except Cordelia is now dead. Cordelia returns to the agency and receives her next client, a man who believes his wife might be cheating on him. Literary significance and criticism Jacques Barzun, in his Catalogue of Crime, was unimpressed: Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The book has been twice adapted. The first adaptation, directed by Chris Petit, was released in UK cinemas in 1982, featuring Pippa Guard as Cordelia. It was financed and produced by Goldcrest Films/ The National Film Finance Corporation and Don Boyd. A television series starring Helen Baxendale as Cordelia and Annette Crosbie as Edith Sparshott was made in 1997 and 2001, based in part upon the book.

The area consisted of the islands Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius (now part of the Netherlands as postal area \\"Caribbean Netherlands\\") as well as Sint Maarten, Cura√ßao and Aruba (which each are separate postal areas). Early mail service in the islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean consisted of carriage by casual ship, and a number of letters are recorded from this period. A British post office operated during the occupation of 1807 to 1815. In 1825, the Dutch government established a post office at Willemstad; from then until 1834 a packet operated between there and Hellevoetsluis. From 1842 to 1854, mail was carried by British packets, and after 1854 by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, until 1885. 2¬Ω cents, 1873  Cura√ßao (1873-1950) The first postage stamps of Cura√ßao (the name was used for the six islands collectively when the areas was named Cura√ßao and Dependencies and Territory of Cura√ßao) were issued 23 May 1873;Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, p. 154. they depicted William III in profile, and were inscribed \\"CURA√áAO\\", as were all issues for the next 77 years. The six original values (2¬Ωc to 50c) were joined by a 2.50-gulden value in 1879, a 12¬Ωc in 1886, and four more values in 1889. All of these were issued without gum (due to the heat and humidity) until 1890. Wilhelmina as a girl, 1895 10c In 1889 a longstanding tradition began with the issuance of low-value (1c to 5c) stamps showing only a large numeral. In 1891 the 30c value was surcharged 25c. Meanwhile, the passing of William left his daughter Wilhelmina to be among the youngest persons depicted on a stamp to that date, with five values appearing between 1892 and 1896. Only the vignette actually changed. 2¬Ωc, 1915 Additional surcharges were needed periodically; 2¬Ωc in 1895, and in 1901/1902 they were applied to stamps of the Netherlands. A new definitive series came out in 1904, with numeral in a horizontal layout for low values, and Wilhelmina in a circular frame for the higher values. Additional values were added in 1906 and 1908. 10c, 1915 In 1915 a new series reused designs from the Netherlands Indies stamps of a few years previously. The low-value numbers were changed to have a white instead of a hatched background, for readability, while medium values showed the Queen and a ship at sea, with the highest values showing the Queen flanked by palm trees. These stamps continued as the standard for many years, with some values getting color changes; for instance, the 5c was originally rose, then changed to green in 1922, then to lilac in 1926. 15c, 1928 The first commemorative stamps, in 1923, celebrated Wilhelmina's 25th anniversary, depicting her with a finely-engraved portrait. The portrait was reused in the definitive series of 1928, which added a steamship to the bottom of the design. In 1934, a series of 17 types marked the 300th anniversary of the colony; designs included portraits of figures significant in history, plus a view of Van Walbeecks' ship. 1936 saw a new definitive series, with the usual lower values as numerals, now vertical in an oval frame, while from 10c on up was a profile of Wilhelmina wearing a sort of shawl or veil drawn back; a depiction of the Queen not seen any other stamps of the Dutch area. 15c, 1941 The 40th anniversary issue in 1938 and the definitives of 1941/1942/1947 reverted to the use of the same profiles of Wilhelmina as the Netherlands and the Netherlands Indies. San Nicolas on Aruba to New York in 1948, using airmail stamps of 1947 and 1942 A set of 15 airmail stamps in October 1942 were bi-colored designs showing airplanes, maps, and scenery in various combinations; they were soon followed by set of six regular issues in 1943 that were also bi-colored, each with a scenic view of a different island. A last set of airmail stamps appeared in 1947, the lower values a stylized plane and posthorn design, and the higher showing a DC-4 skimming the waves. A 1948 set of 11, showing white-haired Wilhelmina in profile, quickly became dated as Queen Juliana was invested with the crown in September; she appeared on a pair of stamps commemorating the occasion in September.

Its name means \\"High Grace\\". It is built upon the Sierras Chicas, in a region that the Comeching√≥n Indians used to call Paravachasca. It has about 43,000 inhabitants ().  History  In the 17th century, Alta Gracia was a large ranch (an estancia) operated by Jesuits. It had been first owned in 1588 by Don Juan Nieto who began the colonization of the area. Under the terms of his encomienda, Nieto began promoting the building of houses, ranches and stone pens. The Jesuits used Alta Gracia, along with other ranches, including Colonia Caroya, Jes√∫s Mar√≠a, Santa Catalina, La Candelaria, and San Ignacio de los Ejercicios, to support the Collegium Maximum or \\"Colegio M√°ximo\\", one of Argentina's first universities (Universitas Cortuba Tucuman√¶) today: Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba. Together with other educational institutes, it is now part of the Manzana Jesu√≠tica (\\"Jesuit Block\\"), an important center in C√≥rdoba City.

Simon. Simon originally called it the Yule distribution. The probability mass function (pmf) of the Yule‚ÄìSimon (œÅ) distribution is :f(k;\\\\rho) = \\\\rho\\\\operatorname{B}(k, \\\\rho+1), for integer k \\\\geq 1 and real \\\\rho > 0, where \\\\operatorname{B} is the beta function. Equivalently the pmf can be written in terms of the rising factorial as : f(k;\\\\rho) = \\\\frac{\\\\rho\\\\Gamma(\\\\rho+1)}{(k+\\\\rho)^{\\\\underline{\\\\rho+1}}}, where \\\\Gamma is the gamma function. Thus, if \\\\rho is an integer, : f(k;\\\\rho) = \\\\frac{\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\rho!\\\\,(k-1)!}{(k+\\\\rho)!}. The parameter \\\\rho can be estimated using a fixed point algorithm. The probability mass function f has the property that for sufficiently large k we have : f(k;\\\\rho) \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\rho\\\\Gamma(\\\\rho+1)}{k^{\\\\rho+1}} \\\\propto \\\\frac 1 {k^{\\\\rho+1}}. Plot of the Yule‚ÄìSimon(1) distribution (red) and its asymptotic Zipf's law (blue) This means that the tail of the Yule‚ÄìSimon distribution is a realization of Zipf's law: f(k;\\\\rho) can be used to model, for example, the relative frequency of the kth most frequent word in a large collection of text, which according to Zipf's law is inversely proportional to a (typically small) power of k. Occurrence The Yule‚ÄìSimon distribution arose originally as the limiting distribution of a particular stochastic process studied by Yule as a model for the distribution of biological taxa and subtaxa. Simon dubbed this process the \\"Yule process\\" but it is more commonly known today as a preferential attachment process. The preferential attachment process is an urn process in which balls are added to a growing number of urns, each ball being allocated to an urn with probability linear in the number the urn already contains. The distribution also arises as a compound distribution, in which the parameter of a geometric distribution is treated as a function of random variable having an exponential distribution. Specifically, assume that W follows an exponential distribution with scale 1/\\\\rho or rate \\\\rho: :W \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Exponential}(\\\\rho), with density :h(w;\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(-\\\\rho w). Then a Yule‚ÄìSimon distributed variable K has the following geometric distribution conditional on W: : K \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Geometric}(1-\\\\exp(-W))\\\\, . The pmf of a geometric distribution is :g(k; p) = p (1-p)^{k-1} for k\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dotsc\\\\\\\\}. The Yule‚ÄìSimon pmf is then the following exponential- geometric compound distribution: :f(k;\\\\rho) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty g(k;\\\\exp(-w)) h(w;\\\\rho)\\\\,dw. The maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter \\\\rho given the observations k_1,k_2,k_3,\\\\dots,k_N is the solution to the fixed point equation : \\\\rho^{(t+1)} = \\\\frac{N+a-1}{b+\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho^{(t)} + j}}, where b=0, a=1 are the rate and shape parameters of the gamma distribution prior on \\\\rho . This algorithm is derived by Garcia by directly optimizing the likelihood. Roberts and Roberts generalize the algorithm to Bayesian settings with the compound geometric formulation described above. Additionally, Roberts and Roberts are able to use the Expectation Maximisation (EM) framework to show convergence of the fixed point algorithm. Moreover, Roberts and Roberts derive the sub-linearity of the convergence rate for the fixed point algorithm. Additionally, they use the EM formulation to give 2 alternate derivations of the standard error of the estimator from the fixed point equation. The variance of the \\\\lambda estimator is : \\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\hat{\\\\lambda}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{N}{\\\\hat{\\\\lambda}^2} - \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\hat{\\\\lambda} + j)^2}}, the standard error is the square root of the quantity of this estimate divided by N. Generalizations The two-parameter generalization of the original Yule distribution replaces the beta function with an incomplete beta function. The probability mass function of the generalized Yule‚ÄìSimon(œÅ, Œ±) distribution is defined as : f(k;\\\\rho,\\\\alpha) = \\\\frac \\\\rho {1-\\\\alpha^\\\\rho} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{B}_{1-\\\\alpha}(k, \\\\rho+1), \\\\, with 0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha < 1. For \\\\alpha = 0 the ordinary Yule‚ÄìSimon(œÅ) distribution is obtained as a special case. The use of the incomplete beta function has the effect of introducing an exponential cutoff in the upper tail.

Cordelia Gray is young woman who works as a private detective in London, having inherited the detective agency \\"Pryde\\" on the death of her boss, Bernie Pryde, who committed suicide. Fictional character biography Cordelia lost her mother an hour after birth. Her father Redvers, a Marxist traveling poet and revolutionary, didn't really care about his daughter, so Cordelia had many adoptive parents, and from six to eight years old she lived in a cottage in Remford with Mrs Gibson and her children. At eleven, she was confused with another C. Gray and won a scholarship to the Convent of Infant Jesus, where she stayed for six years. Then Redvers took her away from the convent, and they started traveling in Germany and Italy with Mr Gray's revolutionary friends. During their wandering, Cordelia worked as their maid, cook, bellhop and nurse. Six months later, Mr. Gray died of a heart disease in Rome. After his death, Cordelia returned to England and became the secretary of the private detective Bernie G. Pryde, and later his partner in investigations. Two months later, Pryde was diagnosed with cancer and committed suicide. Instead of selling the detective agency off, Cordelia decided to keep it open, helped by the young aspiring actor Bevis and the old secretary Mrs. Maudsley. Despite dealing with cases involving murders and threats, the agency becomes specialized in searching for missing animals. At the conclusion of An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, Cordelia Gray meets James's other detective Adam Dalgliesh. In A Taste for Death it is mentioned that they have been seen dining together. Cordelia is also referred to at the beginning and at the end of another Dalgliesh novel, The Black Tower: > Daniel asked [about Dalgliesh]: > \\"Is he conscious?\\" > \\"Barely.

Personality Cordelia lives near Thames Street in an apartment with furniture bought from second-hand dealers or during auctions in the suburbs. At first shy and unconfident, as the story progresses she learns how to solve a case and becomes methodical and serious. A stoic girl, she deals with the suicide of Bernie calmly. Whilst she seems to like order and knowledge, and seems as though she remains focused to the task, during many occasions within The Skull Beneath the Skin she becomes somewhat superficial and conscious of her appearance, compared to that of the more privileged of her clients. Cordelia loves travelling and reading, and is jealous of her privacy. She is a decent shooter. Despite being educated in a Catholic convent, she is not a strong believer. Television Cordelia Gray was first portrayed by Pippa Guard in the 1982 television adaptation of An Unsuitable Job for a Woman. In four separate feature-length dramas comprise the ITV's HTV series (also called An Unsuitable Job for a Woman), Cordelia Gray was portrayed by Helen Baxendale. *Sacrifice was first broadcast from 24 October to 7 November 1997, consisting of three separate 60-minute episodes. *A Last Embrace was first broadcast from 19 February to 5 March 1998, also consisting of three separate 60-minute episodes. *Living on Risk was first broadcast on 27 August 1999, as one 120-minute episode. *Playing God was first broadcast on 16 May 2001, as one 120-minute episode. Other appearances Gray was highlighted in volume 14 of the Detective Conan manga's edition of \\"Gosho Aoyama's Mystery Library\\", a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media. Her name was also used to create a cover name for one of the series' main characters, Ai Haibara: as stated by professor Hiroshi Agasa in volume 18, the kanji meaning \\"gray\\" in her surname is a tribute to Cordelia. Cordelia Glauca from the Japanese anime Tantei Opera Milky Holmes is a descendant of Cordelia Gray, and Gray's ghost also appears in the ninth episode of the first season.

No further appeal is desired because the heart rests in a calm satisfaction that the will of God has been revealed\\".Gee, Concerning Spiritual Gifts, p. 37. Some commentators translate the term as \\"teaching of wisdom\\" and prefer to focus on the gift's function in teaching the truths of scripture. The Catholic Encyclopedia defines it as \\"the grace of propounding the Faith effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of Christianity\\".

He worked extensively in the fields of radio communication, microwave technology, computer music, psychoacoustics, and science fiction. As a sideline to his professional career he wrote science fiction for many years under various names: John Pierce, John R. Pierce, and J. J. Coupling. Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he earned his PhD from Caltech, and died in Sunnyvale, California, from complications of Parkinson's Disease. At Bell Labs Pierce wrote on electronics and information theory, and developed jointly the concept of pulse code modulation (PCM) with his Bell Labs colleagues Barney Oliver and Claude Shannon. He supervised the Bell Labs team which built the first transistor, and at the request of one of them, Walter Brattain, coined the term transistor; he recalled: Pierce's early work at Bell Labs was on vacuum tubes of all sorts. During World War II he discovered the work of Rudolf Kompfner in a British radar lab, where Kompfner had invented the traveling-wave tube;Kompfner, Rudolf, The Invention of the Traveling-Wave Tube, San Francisco Press, 1964. Pierce worked out the math for this broadband amplifier device, and wrote a book about it, after hiring Kompfner for Bell Labs.J. R. Pierce, Traveling-Wave Tubes, New York: van Nostrand Co., 1950 He later recounted that \\"Rudy Kompfner invented the traveling-wave tube, but I discovered it.\\" According to Kompfner's book, the statement \\"Rudi invented the traveling-wave tube, and John discovered it\\" was due to Dr. Eugene G. Fubini, quoted in The New Yorker \\"Profile\\" on Pierce, September 21, 1963. Pierce is widely credited for saying \\"Nature abhors a vacuum tube\\", but Pierce attributed that quip to Myron Glass. Others say that quip was \\"commonly heard at the Bell Laboratories prior to the invention of the transistor.\\" Other famous Pierce quips are \\"Funding artificial intelligence is real stupidity\\", \\"I thought of it the first time I saw it\\", and \\"After growing wildly for years, the field of computing appears to be reaching its infancy.\\" The National Inventors Hall of Fame has honored Bernard M. Oliver and Claude Shannon as the inventors of PCM, as described in 'Communication System Employing Pulse Code Modulation,' filed in 1946 and 1952, granted in 1956. Another patent by the same title was filed by John Pierce in 1945, and issued in 1948: . The three of them published \\"The Philosophy of PCM\\" in 1948. Pierce did significant research into satellites, including an important leadership role (as executive director of Bell's Research-Communications Principles Division ) in the development of the first commercial communications satellite, Telstar 1. In fact, although Arthur C. Clarke was the first to propose geostationary communications satellites, Pierce seems to have arrived at the idea independently and may have been the first to discuss unmanned communications satellites. Clarke himself characterized Pierce as \\"one of the two fathers of the communications satellite\\" (along with Harold Rosen).\\"John Robinson Pierce,\\" Arthur C. Clarke, Locus, May 2002, p.69 See ECHO ‚Äì America's First Communications Satellite (reprinted from SMEC Vintage Electrics Volume 2 #1) for some details on his original contributions. Pierce led the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee that produced the ALPAC report, which had the effect of curtailing most funding for work on machine translation in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Life after Bell Labs  After leaving Bell Laboratories, he joined Caltech as a professor of electrical engineering in 1971. Shortly thereafter, he also took the position of Chief Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 1980 he retired from Caltech and moved to his final position at Stanford's CCRMA. Here he was prominent in the research of computer music, as a Visiting Professor of Music, Emeritus (along with John Chowning and Max Mathews). It was at Stanford that he became an independent co-discoverer of the non-octave musical scale that he later named the Bohlen‚ÄìPierce scale. Many of Pierce's technical books were written at a level intended to introduce a semi-technical audience to modern technical topics. Among them are Electrons, Waves, and Messages; An Introduction to Information Theory: Symbols, Signals, and Noise; Waves and Ear; Man's World of Sound; Quantum Electronics; and Signals: The Science of Telecommunication.John R. Pierce and A. Michael Noll, SIGNALS: The Science of Telecommunication, Scientific American Books (New York, NY), 1990. In 1960, Pierce was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal. In 1962, Pierce received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1963, Pierce received the IEEE Edison Medal for \\"his pioneer work and leadership in satellite communications and for his stimulus and contributions to electron optics, travelling wave tube theory, and the control of noise in electron streams.\\" In 1975, he received the IEEE Medal of Honor for \\"his pioneering concrete proposals and the realization of satellite communication experiments, and for contributions in theory and design of traveling wave tubes and in electron beam optics essential to this success.\\" In 1985, he was one of the first two recipients of the Japan Prize \\"for outstanding achievement in the field of electronics and communications technologies.\\"LAUREATES; 1985 (1st) Japan Prize Laureates; Prize Category: Information and Communications; Dr. John R. Pierce (United States)  Personal life  Besides his technical books, Pierce wrote science fiction under the pseudonym J.J. Coupling, which refers to the total angular momenta of individual particles. John Pierce also had an early interest in gliding and assisted in the development of the Long Beach Glider Club in Los Angeles, one of the earliest glider clubs in the United States. According to Richard Hamming \\"you couldn't talk to John Pierce without being stimulated very quickly.\\" Pierce had been a resident of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, Pasadena, California, and later of Palo Alto, California.Kamin, Arthur Z. \\"State Becomes a Part of Celebrating Marconi's Achievements\\", The New York Times, October 23, 1994. Accessed July 6, 2008. \\"The recipient in 1979 was Dr. John R. Pierce, then of the California Institute of Technology who had been with AT&T; Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill and at Holmdel. Dr. Pierce had lived in Berkeley Heights and now lives in Palo Alto, Calif.\\" In his later years, as a Visiting Professor at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, he and his wife Brenda were known for holding dinner parties in their Palo Alto home, in which they would invite an eclectic mix of guests and lead lively discussions on topics ranging from space exploration to politics, health care, and 20th-century music. One such dinner party was reported in This Is Your Brain On Music, written by Pierce's former student Daniel Levitin. The papers of John R. Pierce are at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. At his death Pierce was survived by his wife Brenda; a son, science fiction editor John Jeremy Pierce; and a daughter, Elizabeth Anne Pierce.Memorial Resolution: John Robinson Pierce (1910‚Äì2002) See also * ALPAC report References Sources *The National Academies Press External links * IEEE Global History Network biography * Creative Thinking by J.

It was founded in 1909 in Clintonville, Wisconsin, as the Badger Four-Wheel Drive Auto Company by Otto Zachow and William Besserdich.Borth, Christy. Masters of Mass Production. Indianapolis, Ind.: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1945, pp. 210-14. The first production facility was built in 1911 and was designed by architect Wallace W. DeLong of Appleton, Wisconsin. FWD renamed FWD Corporation and its associates Seagrave, Baker Aerialscope, and Almonte Fire Trucks were sold in 2003 to an investment group headed by former American LaFrance executive James Hebe. Today, the Seagrave Fire Apparatus group is a flagship company of ELB Capital Management. History Four Wheel Drive Auto Company 1918 ad in The Horseless Age Share of the Four Wheel Drive Auto Co., issued 6. May 1919 Zachow and Besserdich developed and built the first successful four-wheel drive (4x4) car, the \\"Battleship\\", in 1908. Its success led to the founding of the company. \\"Badger\\" was dropped from the name in 1910. Besserdich and Zachow's patented full time four wheel drive system combined a lockable center differential with double-Y constant velocity universal joints for steering. In modern terms the \\"Battleship\\" would be considered all wheel drive, as all FWD products featured full-time four wheel drive with a lockable center differential. The success of the four-wheel drive in early military tests prompted the company to switch from cars to trucks. In 1916 the U.S. Army ordered 147 Model B three ton trucks for the Pancho Villa Expedition. The U.S. Army ordered 15,000 FWD Model B three ton trucks as the \\"Truck, 3 ton, Model 1917\\" during World War I with over 14,000 actually delivered; additional orders came from the United Kingdom and Russia. In two world wars, U.S. and allied armies depended on such four-wheel drive vehicles.Borth, Christy. Masters of Mass Production. Indianapolis, Ind.: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1945, pp. 212-14. Numerous FWD model B trucks, both military and civilian, survive in working condition; a Model 1917 U.S. Army truck in working condition is on display at the Fort MacArthur Military Museum, San Pedro, Los Angeles, California. Early FWD vehicles were made with a track width of so they could quickly be used on a standard gauge railway line merely by changing the wheels. The FWD Model B was produced under license by four additional manufacturers during World War I: Peerless Motor Company, Cleveland, Ohio; Kissel Motor Car Company, Hartford, Wisconsin; Premier Motor Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana; and Mitchell Motor Car Company, Racine, Wisconsin.Karolevitz, p.100 Three FWD Model B trucks were included in the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. According to 1st Lt. E. R. Jackson, the official Ordnance Department observer: \\"The three (3) Four Wheel Drive Trucks were, in general, the most satisfactory in the Convoy and of all of the various makes represented, the F.W.D.'s alone were able to pull through all of the bad, muddy, and sandy stretches of road in Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada absolutely unaided.\\" (emphasis in the original.) A Canadian subsidiary was set up in conjunction with Dominion Truck of Kitchener, Ontario by 1919. A British subsidiary was set up at Slough in 1921. In 1926, the British FWD, also known as the Jeffry Quad, was produced with a larger 70 bhp engine. A relationship with premier race car constructor Harry Miller resulted in the Four Wheel Drive Miller that competed successfully at the Indianapolis 500 in 1931 and later. This car was intended to demonstrate that the advantages FWD's lockable center differential were not limited to off-road driving. One example survives and has competed in premier vintage race car meets such as the Goodwood Festival of Speed. \\"The Last Great Miller\\" by Griffith Borgeson gives a complete history of this landmark car. In 1932, AEC took a controlling interest in the British company and began to use more standard AEC components in the Slough-built vehicles. To distinguish these from imported U.S. FWD vehicles, they were marketed under the name Hardy. Production ceased about 1936, but AEC exploited its experience with all-wheel drive in its Second World War Matador (4x4) and Marshall (6x6) vehicles. In 1939, the company formed a flight department. Their acquisition of a used Waco biplane would eventually evolve into North Central Airlines. FWD Corp P-2 crash tender (left) In 1958, the company's name was changed to FWD Corporation. In 1963, FWD acquired Seagrave Fire Apparatus who then moved from their old location in Columbus, Ohio, to their current location at FWD in Clintonville, Wisconsin. Many tower ladders in the 1990s using Seagrave chassis were branded as FWD. They used Baker Aerialscopes for the boom which FWD had also acquired over the years along with Almonte Fire Trucks. Randolph Lenz, chairman of FWD's parent company, Corsta Corp., became embroiled in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation suit, and in 2003 all assets of FWD, FWD Corporation, Seagrave, Baker Aerialscope, and Almonte Fire Trucks were sold to an investment group headed by former American LaFrance executive James Hebe. Today, the Seagrave Fire Apparatus group is a flagship company of ELB Capital Management.

Their use has historically been largely confined to NASCAR stock car racing, partially due to the much larger surface area of a stock car, and longer season, but have entered the IndyCar in a limited fashion. NASCAR's increased media coverage has contributed to their popularity with both fans and sponsors. However, some sponsors and die-cast makers have advanced the promotion to other codes of motorsport, as Red Bull Racing had a Star Wars paint scheme to promote Revenge of the Sith in Formula One and a similar Superman one to promote Superman Returns. Panther Racing in the Indy Racing League ran a Pennzoil Platinum paint scheme at selected 2005 IRL events instead of the normal yellow design. History 1991 Daytona 500: Winston Salutes the Troops Special paint schemes in NASCAR date back to the 1991 Daytona 500. As part of an R. J. Reynolds promotion, five unsponsored drivers had paint schemes on their cars that paid tribute to the branches of the United States Armed Forces serving in Operation Desert Storm: * No. 7: Alan Kulwicki ‚Äì Army * No. 18: Greg Sacks ‚Äì Navy * No. 24: Mickey Gibbs ‚Äì Air Force * No. 71: Dave Marcis ‚Äì Coast Guard * No. 88: Buddy Baker ‚Äì Marines Dale Earnhardt's \\"Quick Silver\\" Alternate paint schemes truly gained notoriety in 1995, when Dale Earnhardt appeared at The Winston with a silver car (in tribute to Winston's silver anniversary) instead of his traditional black car. The car was nicknamed \\"Quick Silver\\" or \\"Silver Select\\". A year later, Earnhardt continued the trend at the 1996 running of The Winston with a 1996 Atlanta Olympics themed car. Fan reaction to the paint schemes proved popular such that by the end of the decade, scarcely a race went by without one or more drivers sporting a special paint scheme. Often one-week special sponsorship deals were involved in the schemes, and other times existing sponsors chose to promote alternate products within the firm. Examples of one- week deals include promoting first run films coinciding with the particular race weekend, and promoting other simultaneous events (such as the Olympics). Often several drivers sported related paint schemes simultaneously. Popular themes Custom paint schemes frequently feature special events, and often include the following: * An associate sponsor becomes the primary sponsor for selected races. ** Often, if that associate sponsor is sponsoring the race, they will have primary sponsorship for that race. * Sports teams (especially during special promotions) ** During the 2001 MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400, the MBNA-sponsored No. 18 driven by Bobby Labonte drove a special Ripken-themed Pontiac Grand Prix. The Baltimore Orioles game that night was scheduled as Ripken's last home game until games were rescheduled because of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Ripken was grand marshal, started the race, and the race winner was to attend that game. **At the 2007 Lenox Industrial Tools 300, Carl Edwards used a Boston Red Sox-based car in celebration of Jack Roush partnering with Fenway Sports Group, headquartered in New England. The next year, David Ragan had a Bosox-based car. **InBev, the sponsor of the George Gillett-owned No. 9 Ford Fusion driven by Kasey Kahne, fielded a white car with a mountainous motif featuring the Olympic rings as part of the Belgian brewer's sponsorship of the United States Olympic team at the 2010 Winter Olympics. This paint scheme was used only for the races that were held during the length of the Olympic Games. * Charities ** During the 2010 All-Star race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Dale Earnhardt Jr. ran a special paint scheme featuring the JR Foundation Logo on the hood, to commemorate this occasion. The design was reintroduced for the 2012 All-Star race. ** The Home Depot often fielded a Kaboom-themed car for Joey Logano and Tony Stewart during their tenures with Joe Gibbs Racing. ** Lowe's fields a \\"Power of Pride\\" car with the USO as a benefactor. ** Dale Jarrett raced a \\"reverse\\" paint scheme in 1999 where his entire car's colour scheme was reversed for breast cancer research. * Cartoon Characters ** The Muppets were featured on a special series during a 2002 race at the Chicagoland Speedway. ** The Looney Tunes were used as part of a promotion with the September race at Richmond International Raceway with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo 400 in 2002. * Rock Bands ** During the time that Chevrolet sponsored the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond International Raceway, some of the cars featured paint schemes based on popular rock bands. ** 3 Doors Down has also been featured on several NASCAR cars before with Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2008 for the NASCAR Sprint All Star Race and Tony Stewart in the Nationwide Series in 2003 for a race at Michigan International Speedway. Movie themes The use of movie-themed cars is viewed as being perfectly suited to promotion through the use of special paint schemes due to the short-term nature of a movie's box office run. Often, a sponsor is involved in a movie, and to promote the movie, they will deal with the movie producers to have their car painted to reflect the movie. Other times, a film studio will work with a driver to have the movie theme. List of notable movie themes *Toy Story (2, and 3) *The Passion of the Christ: An advertisement for this movie was placed on the hood of Bobby Labonte's car at the 2004 Daytona 500 *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines: Special paint scheme was driven once by Jamie McMurray *Hulk *Shrek (2, and The Third): For the former, special paint schemes were driven by Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart at the 2004 Coca-Cola 600. For Shrek the Third, special paint schemes were used in 2007 by David Gilliland and Tony Raines. *Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie: Jimmie Johnson & Kyle Busch drove this scheme in a fall Busch race at Lowe's in 2004. *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry: Kasey Kahne in the 2007 Pepsi 400 *Batman Forever: Bill Elliott drove such a promotion paint job in 1995. *Jurassic Park: Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart at several 2001 races, as well as Jeff Gordon in the 1997 All-Star Race. Gordon's 1997 All-Star Race winner is known as \\"T-Rex\\" that dominated the race and was effectively banned by NASCAR afterwards. *Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (NASCAR and IRL special paint schemes). Kyle Busch won the Dodge Challenger 500 in 2008 with the movie on the car. *Click: Driven by Kasey Kahne to victory at Michigan in 2006. *Herbie: Fully Loaded: Special paint scheme was driven by Dale Jarrett in 2005 at Infineon. *The Dark Knight Rises: Dale Earnhardt Jr. drove and won the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan in a car painted to promote The Dark Knight Rises. *Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith: This promotional paint job was used by Jeff Gordon at the 2005 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, which he won. *Minions (film): In the 2015 Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway, Carl Edwards drove the paint scheme to promote the Despicable Me spinoff movie. *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: In the 2016 Auto Club 400, Dale Earnhardt Jr. (Batman) and Jimmie Johnson (Superman) drive specially themed cars. Johnson won with his Superman theme. *Cars 3: Kyle Larson drove the paint scheme in 2017 to promote the movie. He won the race at Michigan with this scheme. Clint Bowyer ran a Cars 3 scheme at Sonoma 2 weeks later as well, finishing 2nd. Throwback themes Following trends in other sports, \\"throwback\\" paint schemes have also gained popularity in recent years, celebrating past accomplishments of well-known drivers. List of notable throwback themes * Harry Gant ** For the 1994 Hooters 500, his final race, the car was based on a 1981 paint scheme with Burt Reynolds and Hal Needham. * Darrell Waltrip ** To celebrate 25 years since his first Winston Cup race (1972), during the 1997 season, he had cars painted to resemble different cars during his career. A special chrome car was also designed. ** Has been the subject of various throwback designs by various teams, most notably Hendrick Motorsports (the team where he won his Daytona 500), though none of the Hendrick throwbacks reflected on his time at Hendrick. * Jeff Gordon ** In celebrating his distinguished career at Sprint All-Star Race XX, his car was painted to resemble the 1992‚Äì2000 original DuPont \\"Rainbow Warriors,\\" complete with the DuPont logo and \\"Automotive Finishes\\" on the side of the car, instead of the \\"DUPONT\\" design on the sides used from 2001-12 (the last race with DuPont; those logos belong to Dow as of 2017). Axalta, the successor company to DuPont Performance Coatings (spun off in 2013), ran the same 1992-2000 livery with the current Axalta logo and text on the cars at the 2015 Irwin Tools Night Race for his final full-time season. The livery was again used in 2018 by Hendrick Motorsports with current No. 24 driver William Byron at Darlington, which is the series' retro round. ** To celebrate the debut of Pepsi Throwback, Gordon drove in a replica of Waltrip's 1983 \\"Pepsi Challenger\\" at the 2009 Aaron's 499, which was involved in an early crash on lap 8. Ironically, Waltrip did not drive the yellow Pepsi Challenger design at that race, the spring race, during the season. (Pepsi used the yellow Pepsi Challenger livery for other motorsport teams at the time. most notably All American Racers in CART and Don Prudhomme in NHRA.) ** At the 2016 Darlington retro round, he drove a Buddy Baker \\"Grey Ghost\\" scheme. The 2016 Gordon Darlington car became a theme Dale Earnhardt Jr. drove at the 2017 October Martinsville race, except it used contemporary logos. ** At the 2019 Darlington Xfinity retro round, Michael Annett and sponsor Pilot Flying J had a 1992 Bill Davis Racing Baby Ruth Ford based livery on the JR Motorsports No. 1 Chevrolet. Despite the retro scheme, the car used current logos, including the Baby Ruth (which is being redone after its new owners, Ferrero Group) and Pilot Flying J logos. * Molson Coors (Miller brands) ** During Rusty Wallace's \\"Last Call\\" tour in 2005, one of his cars featured the 1991‚Äì1995 Miller Genuine Draft black and gold paint scheme, complete with graphics replete of that era. ** At the 2015 Pure Michigan 400, Team Penske had Brad Keselowski, who now drove the Miller Lite Ford, drive the car in the Miller Genuine Draft livery as part of the 25 years of Miller and Penske celebration. The same design was used at the 2017 Rebel 500. ** At the Rebel 500 weeks later, Keselowski's car reflected the 1983 Miller High Life Bobby Allison livery from the Southern 500 win (the last Labor Day race; in 1984, the race moved to Sunday) and the ensuing Championship season. ** At the 2018 Darlington retro round, the 1990 livery was used. * Mark Martin ** During the 2005 \\"Salute to You\\" tour, cars were painted to reflect various stages of Martin's career. ** Roush Fenway Racing has used various liveries inspired by Martin's career. * Chevron Corporation ** Prior to pulling out in 2007, Chevron's Texaco Havoline brand had featured special schemes to celebrate the brand's past. Their most notable special scheme was the 1987 Ranier-Lundy \\"Battlestar\\" scheme of the late Davey Allison, which debuted at the 1997 Coca- Cola 600 and was later used in the DieHard 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway. * Mountain Dew ** The 1981‚Äì82 Mountain Dew Championship Seasons of Darrell Waltrip has been used at various times for Hendrick Motorsports liveries in Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series cars. * Richard Childress Racing ** During the 2004 UAW-GM Quality 500, to celebrate 35 years of Richard Childress Racing, the team ran three throwback schemes, with designs based on Childress schemes from the team's first win in 1983, the team's famed 1987 championship, and 1995 silver car). *Dale Earnhardt Jr. ** Earnhardt raced two throwbacks in 2006, one dedicated to his father, using a black paint scheme reminiscent of his father's Busch cars, and a second using a cream-colored design, similar to his late grandfather Ralph's 1956 Sportsman championship. That car has authentic-looking \\"#8\\" graphics from 1956, and Dale Jr's sponsor Budweiser added 1956-era Budweiser logos. ** During Sprint All-Star Race XXIV, Earnhardt raced a car painted similar to Buddy Baker's \\"Grey Ghost\\" Oldsmobile 442 that won the 1980 Daytona 500 and set a race record that still stands. ** Various regular schemes during Earnhardt's career at Hendrick Motorsports have influence from past cars. A later-era Baker Oldsmobile 88 scheme (Crisco) was flipped for his 2014-15 Nationwide livery, while the vertical stripes on a 1981 Wrangler scheme from his father are featured in the Windows 10 design in 2015. TaxSlayer (his father's Wrangler, 1986‚Äì87) and Axalta (Xfinity Oreo) all will have influence from past cars in 2016. ** At the Rebel 500 retro round in 2017, his final full-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season in 2017, his 1998 Xfinity Series championship livery was used with current Nationwide decals. ** For the October 2017 Martinsville race, the Jeff Gordon Nationwide #88 scheme, except with current-era Nationwide logos, was used. (Gordon's car carried the retro logos because it was used at Darlington.) ** For his final scheduled Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race, his 1999 scheme was used as the basis with current Axalta logos as part of a promotion with Axalta's introduction of Cromax EZ paint. It was also the last race in the Series for the Holden VF Commodore. ** For the 2018 Xfinity Series round at Darlington, Tyler Reddick, then driving for Earnhardt, used an Old Milwaukee livery inspired by Tim Richmond's Cup car in 1983‚Äì85, fielded by Raymond Beadle, whose son Ryan spearheaded the design as the general counsel for JR Motorsports. ** For his 2019 Xfinity Series start at Darlington, he and sponsor Unilever arranged a livery based on a vintage car his father drove to his first Cup start in 1975, with approval of Norman Negre (son of the car owner). *Chevrolet **During the August 2007 Nextel Cup weekend at Michigan International Speedway, the cars of 11 Team Chevy drivers were decorated with special paint schemes commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1957 Chevrolet. The cars driven by Ward Burton, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Mark Martin, Casey Mears, Paul Menard, Tony Raines, Martin Truex Jr., Scott Wimmer and J.J. Yeley all sported cues from the '57 Chevy's memorable design while J.J. Yeley's No. 18 Monte Carlo SS displayed a throwback Interstate Batteries logo. *Darlington Raceway ** The Rebel 500 moved from its traditional spring date to September, where the fall race (the Southern 500; note that the history of the current Darlington race dates to the lineage of the 1957 Rebel 300) was held from 1950-2003 until it moved to November in 2004 and eliminated as a result of the Ferko lawsuit, replaced by the AAA Texas 500 at the Texas Motor Speedway a year. Various teams unveiled throwback and special paint schemes as part of a promotion with the track. The weekend has become an annual throwback weekend. ** Some NASCAR Hall of Fame drivers have had multiple schemes from their career influence multiple drivers in the same race. Two teams‚ÄîWood Brothers (1976 NASCAR season) and Hendrick Motorsports (1979 Talladega 500), for example, in 2016 use David Pearson liveries on their cars. Response to throwback themes After Ernie Irvan put the throwback \\"Battlestar\\" on the pole at the 1997 DieHard 500, fan reaction forced Robert Yates Racing to consider having the \\"Battlestar\\" design at Talladega for the rest of the team's association with Texaco. When Chevron (who had bought Texaco) switched to Chip Ganassi Racing, fan reaction forced the sponsor to revert to the old Yates-era 1994-2000 design after Chevron changed the paint scheme in 2001. Liz Allison (Davey's widow) told the media in announcing the 2003 Battlestar old fans would be cheering heavily when they see the classic design returning for the race, and warned Ganassi driver Jamie McMurray that if he won the race in the Battlestar, \\"You better bar the door because the Allisons are taking over. We're really excited and very touched (by Chevron's generosity in remembering a legend).\\"http://www.fastmachines.com/archives/nascar/000837print.php Military paint schemes The military-sponsored cars of six drivers in 2004. From left to right: Greg Biffle (National Guard), Bobby Hamilton Jr. (Marines), Casey Atwood (Navy), Joe Nemechek (Army), Justin Labonte (Coast Guard), Ricky Rudd (Air Force) New variations on the military paint schemes have also been used throughout the years. The United States Army began sponsoring the No. 01 car owned by MB2 Motorsports full-time in 2003. For major anniversaries, the cars used a special camouflage design. The Army then went to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. for two seasons before joining Stewart Haas Racing in 2009 and was the primary sponsor of Ryan Newman's No. 39 until 2012. Although the schemes were not military-based, several cars used patriotic paint schemes for the 2001 MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover, the first race after the September 11 attacks. Often die-cast replicas of the paint scheme cars are produced for the collector market. Differences between special and alternating paint schemes With the economics of the sport dictating higher expenses, some sponsors have decided to share sponsor space with other sponsors, leading to two \\"regular\\" designs which alternate, such as Richard Childress Racing, where all three teams have multiple alternating primary sponsors. In 2009, the No. 29 team had Shell and Hershey, while the No. 31 had Caterpillar, AstraZeneca, and Lenox Industrial Tools, and the #07 has Jack Daniel's, DirecTV, and BB&T; as their three sponsors. Other sponsors have decided to promote different products with their sponsor dollars, such as Mars (M&M;'s, Snickers, Skittles, Wrigley's, Pedigree, Banfield Pet Hospitals), Lowe's (two schemes, one standard which can be configured to promote professional services or have the regular logo, and one Kobalt Tools), and Kellogg's with the standard Kellogg's and Cheez-It snacks (a Kellogg's product) schemes, and FedEx, which uses five different schemes with color differences to promote four different brands‚ÄîExpress, Ground, Freight, and Kinko's. (A fifth scheme was used in 2005 at Darlington, and is a special scheme, to promote the St. Jude Hospital they support in Memphis.) Those are not \\"special\\" schemes, but are co-primary schemes to promote various products by a sponsor who may be willing to use the broadcasts to promote their wide variety of products. The sheer number of special paint schemes has led to criticism that they are no longer \\"special\\" at all. However, it should be differentiated between alternating sponsors, different products on cars (especially promotions for special products), and the true special paint schemes, which promote special events. IndyCar Series Though not as widespread as NASCAR, cars in the IndyCar Series have also participated in special paint schemes. Most that have been used have featured a \\"retro\\" or tribute paint scheme, depicting a notable car from the past. In most cases, the sponsors are not the same but carry the current sponsors' decals on the classic liveries. *Arie Luyendyk in 1991, driving for Vince Granatelli.1987‚Äì1991: Vince Granatelli and later UNO/Granatelli entries sported a \\"throwback\\" paint scheme which featured a day-glow orange, similar to that of the STP Turbine cars of the late 60s, and other Andy Granatelli entries of the early 1970s.

Art cars German manufacturer BMW has a tradition of competing with arts cars which started in the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Artists such as David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol have contributed to the project.

Bertram David \\"Bert\\" Wolfe (January 19, 1896 ‚Äì February 21, 1977) was an American scholar and former communist best known for biographical studies of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, and Diego Rivera. Background Bertram Wolfe was born January 19, 1896, in Brooklyn, New York. His mother was a native-born American and his father was an ethnic Jewish immigrant from Germany who had arrived in the United States as a boy of 13.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 514-515. Wolfe studied to teach English literature and writing and received degrees from the College of the City of New York, Columbia University, and the University of Mexico. Career Communist Party Wolfe was active with the Socialist Party of America in his youth and was an active participant in the Left Wing Section which emerged in 1919. Wolfe attended the June 1919 National Conference of the Left Wing and was elected by that body to its nine-member National Council. He helped draft the manifesto of that organization, together with Louis C. Fraina and John Reed. In 1919 Wolfe became a founding member of the Communist Party of America (CPA). Together with Maximilian Cohen, Wolfe was responsible for The Communist World, the CPA's first newspaper in New York City.\\"Wolfe Starts Campaign Tour: Communist Candidate to Speak in Many Cities,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 5, no. 235 (October 4, 1928), pp. 1, 3. During the period of repression of leading Communists in New York conducted by the Lusk Committee, Wolfe fled to California. In 1920 he became a member of the San Francisco Cooks' Union. He also edited a left wing trade union paper called Labor Unity from 1920 to 1922. Wolfe was a delegate to the ill-fated August 1922 convention of the underground CPA held in Bridgman, Michigan, for which he was indicted under Michigan's \\"criminal syndicalism\\" law. In 1923, Wolfe departed for Mexico, where he became active in the trade union movement there. He became a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Mexico and was a delegate of that organization to the 5th World Congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow in 1924. Wolfe was also a leading member the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern) from 1924 to 1928, sitting on that body's Executive Committee. Wolfe was ultimately deported from Mexico to the United States in July 1925 for activities related to a strike of Mexican railway workers. Upon his return to America, Wolfe took over as head of the Party's New York Workers School, located at 26 Union Square and offering 70 courses in the social sciences to some 1500 students. After his return to the United States, Wolfe became a close political associate of factional leader Jay Lovestone, who became the leader of the American Communist Party following the death of C.E. Ruthenberg in 1927. He was editor of The Communist, the official theoretical journal of the Communist Party, in 1927 and 1928. Wolfe was chosen as a delegate of the American Communist Party to the Sixth World Congress of the Comintern in 1928. In 1928, Wolfe was made the national director of agitation and propaganda for the Workers (Communist) Party of America. He also ran for U.S. Congress as a Communist in the 10th Congressional District of New York.\\"Red Ticket Goes on Ballot in NY State,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 5, no. 241 (October 11, 1928), pg. 3. Late in December 1928, with the election campaign at an end, Wolfe was dispatched by the Lovestone-dominated Central Executive Committee of the American Communist Party to serve as it delegate to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), where he replaced J. Louis Engdahl.Theodore Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia. New York: Viking Press, 1960; pg. 392. In that capacity, he became involved in the attempt of Jay Lovestone to maintain control of the American organization over the growing opposition of Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov, who ultimately supported the rival faction headed by William Z. Foster and Alexander Bittelman. According to Benjamin Gitlow's 1940 memoir, I Confess, Wolfe was directed by the Comintern in April 1929 to be removed from his post in Moscow and to instead accept a dangerous assignment to Korea - at the time under Japanese rule - as part of the campaign against the Lovestone group in the American Communist Party.Benjamin Gitlow, I Confess: The Truth About American Communism. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1940; pp. 547-548. Wolfe refused the assignment, providing a long statement of his reasons to ECCI for this decision, according to Gitlow. In June 1929, Wolfe was expelled from the Communist Party, USA for refusing to support the Comintern's decisions regarding the American Communist Party, which effectively removed Lovestone from power. Communist Party (Opposition) Upon returning to the United States, he and Lovestone, who had also been expelled from the party, formed the Communist Party (Opposition) to further their views. Having expected a majority of American Communists to join them, they were disappointed at only being able to attract a few hundred followers. Wolfe became editor of the CP(O)'s newspaper Worker's Age and its chief theorist. Initially, Lovestone and Wolfe hoped to eventually be welcomed back into the Communist movement but when changes in the Comintern's line failed to result in a rapprochement, the CP(O) moved further and further away from communism. Wolfe and Lovestone were sympathisers of Nikolai Bukharin and helped found the International Communist Opposition (also known as the International Right Opposition) which for a time had some influence before petering out. In the 1930s, Wolfe and his wife, Ella Goldberg Wolfe, travelled around the world visiting Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Mexico City in 1933 and spending time in Spain prior to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. By 1940, the Wolfes were living in Provincetown, Massachusetts where they befriended Alfred Kazin and introduced him to Mary McCarthy and the writers of the Partisan Review. The CP(O) meanwhile moved further away from the left and went through several name changes finally becoming the Independent Labor League of America in 1938 before dissolving at the end of 1940 in part because of a break between Lovestone and Wolfe on their interpretation of World War II - with Lovestone favoring American intervention and Wolfe opposing support for what he argued was an imperialist war. Cold War Wolfe's political perspective changed with time, however, and during the Cold War was a leading anti-Communist. In the 1950s, he worked as ideological advisor to the State Department's International Broadcasting Office which was in charge of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. He then joined Stanford University's Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace's library as senior fellow in Slavic studies and, in 1966, became a senior research fellow at the institution. He also served as a visiting professor at Columbia University and the University of California. In 1973 Wolfe was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II. Personal life and death In 1917, Wolfe married Ella Goldberg (May 10, 1896 ‚Äì January 8, 2000). Wolfe died on February 21, 1977, from burns he suffered when his bathrobe caught fire. He was 81 years old at the time of his death.  Works  * Our Heritage from 1776: A Working Class View of the First American Revolution. With Jay Lovestone and William F.

As an extraordinary charism, gifts of healing are supernatural enablements given to a believer to minister various kinds of healing and restoration to individuals through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the Greek of the New Testament, both the words gift and healing are plural.Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, Foundations of Pentecostal Theology, 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), p. 337. In the Gospel of Mark's account of the Great Commission, Jesus stated that one of the signs to follow believers in him would be healing after the laying on of hands. In the fifth chapter of the Epistle of James, anointing with oil is involved with the laying on of hands and prayer over the sick. These symbolize that believers were channels of divine power and that the healing was the work of the Holy Spirit. Healing is also connected with the forgiveness of sins. Pentecostal and charismatic Christians believe \\"that God has made provision that physical healing would be a ministry of His church and that gifts of healings would operate along with faith\\". However, they also believe that no minister of healing will heal all that come to them.Gee, Donald. Concerning Spiritual Gifts. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House. . Page 51. Faith on the part of the one who prays is essential for healing, but many times faith on the part of one being prayed for is important as well. All Pentecostals and charismatics are encouraged to pray for the healing of the sick even if they do not claim possession of the supernatural gift.Gee, Concerning Spiritual Gifts, 52.

Edmonton Journal, June 6, 1991. The event is organized by Canvention and the awards are given out by the Canadian SF and Fantasy Association and SFSF Boreal Inc. Originally they were known as the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Awards which was shortened to CSFFA and nicknamed the Casper Awards based on that acronym, but this name was changed to the Aurora Awards in 1991, because the Aurora is the same in English and French. The categories have expanded from those focused on literary works to include categories that recognize achievements in comics, music, poetry, art, film and television. Originally, the CSFFA gave out both the English-language and French-language versions of the awards, with the French-language version known as the Prix Aurora. However, the French-language section of the awards is now known as the Prix Aurora-Bor√©al and was created through an agreement between SFSFBI and the CSFFA in November 2010, which combined the independent Prix Bor√©al and the Prix Aurora into a single award affiliated to the English-language award. The awards are selected by member vote, in a similar style to that of the Hugo Awards.\\"It's almost time for sci- fi awards\\". Sudbury Star, September 11, 1999.\\"Speculative fiction seriously coming of age\\". Edmonton Journal, September 13, 1998. The first award was granted in 1980 at Hal-Con 3, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which was in turn the first convention to be named Canvention, a name which rotates to the convention hosting the awards that year in addition to its regular name. For lists of winners and nominees for each category, see the list of award categories below. Award The Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association (CSFFA) and the SFSFBI give out the Aurora and Aurora-Bor√©al Awards for the best science fiction and fantasy works in each of the categories. CSFFA handle the anglophone Aurora Awards and the SFSFBI handle the francophone Aurora-Bor√©al Awards, though both organizations co-sponsor the other award. Nominees are only valid if they were produced or completed in the previous calendar year. For the Aurora Awards, the official nominees are chosen by the awards committee from all of the works that have received at least 5 nominations by CSFFA members throughout the year, and then the shortlist is voted on by every member of the CSFFA. This is obtained through a $10 membership fee, and can be voted in person with a voting card at the annual general meeting of the CSFFA at that year's Canvention, or online through a portal set up by the CSFFA. A member must have been a member for at least 1 month before Canvention to be eligible for voting. The deadlines for voting are set by the CSFFA at the previous year's Canvention. For a category to not have an award given for it, usually there has to be less than three eligible nominees in that category before the start of voting, or enough people have voted for the No Award option on the ballot, and this wins a majority. The voting uses the instant-runoff voting method, where the voters rank their choices and the lowest scorer is eliminated until one nominee has a majority. For the CSFFA Hall of Fame, the inductee must have been nominated for the trophy, and then selected by a 4-person jury, which is selected by the CSFFA each year.

History  In 1987 - 1989 Dalton ran a bookshop (owned by Dalton's parents) in the Sydney suburb of Glebe called Dalton's Books. In late 1989, Dalton and his friend Miles Ferguson, took over the store, renamed it Half A Cow and started stocking more comics, records and tee-shirts than the 'beat' books they had been concentrating on. At the same time, they started Half A Cow Records and started working on the label's first release, Billiepeebup (hac01, released October 1990) - a 4-track recorded album of songs made between 1985 and 1989 by the Love Positions, a duo of Dalton and his then girlfriend, Robyn St Clare from The Hummingbirds. That was the label's second release (out October 1990), the first being a 10\\" EP called Pleasure (cow01) by the Craven Fops in March 1990. In 1991, Half A Cow released the single Don't Want To Be Grant McLennan by Smudge (about Go-Betweens co-founder Grant McLennan), which was an indie hit, and single of the week in music magazine NME In late 1991 Evan Dando asked Dalton to temporarily join The Lemonheads. An offer he initially turned down, but as Dando pointed out that it'd make his label known worldwide, and with persuasion from friends he did indeed join, and as expected in 1992 it gave a huge boost for Half a Cow. Before he left Half A Cow assistant, Dave Chatfield, was appointed to run the label, along with Robyn St Clare. In 1992 the label also signed a deal with Festival Records to distribute the label. In 1994 the label switched distributor to Mercury Records, which was followed by a change in 1998 back to Festival Records. In early 2000 Half A Cow ended its relationship with Festival Records and now the label is completely independent and distributed through MGM Distribution. Chatfield moved to Melbourne to pursue touring with Spunk and the label is solely managed by Dalton. Since its establishment in 1990 Half A Cow has put out over two hundred and fifty releases by a long line of bands and solo acts, including work by Dalton and bands he has been in (such as Sneeze, Godstar, a re-issue of The Plunderers' Banana Smoothie, Honey, and Nic Dalton and his Gloomchasers), who dissolved in November 2019. As of May 2006, the label is based back in Sydney (after six years in NSW's central west and a year in Digger's Rest, Victoria) where it continues to release contemporary Australian music as well as a series of re- issues by bands from the 1960s (like Pip Proud, The Missing Links, The Purple Hearts and the Wild Cherries).

The purpose of the vocal sac is usually as an amplification of their mating or advertisement call. The presence or development of the vocal sac is one way of externally determining the sex of a frog in many species. The vocal sac is open to the mouth cavity of the frog, with two slits on either side of the tongue. To call, the frog inflates its lungs and shuts its nose and mouth. Air is then expelled from the lungs, through the larynx, and into the vocal sac. The vibrations of the larynx emits a sound, which resonates on the elastic membrane of the vocal sac. The resonance causes the sound to be amplified and allows the call to carry further. Muscles within the body wall force the air back and forth between the lungs and vocal sac. Development The development of the vocal sac is different in most species, however they mostly follow the same process. The development of the unilobular vocal sac begins with two small growths on the floor of the mouth. These grow until they form two small pouches, which expand until they meet in the centre of the mouth and form one large cavity, which then grows until it is fully developed. Purpose The primary purpose of the vocal sac is to amplify the advertisement call of the male, and attract females from as large an area as possible. Species of frog without vocal sacs may only be heard within a radius of a few metres, whereas some species with vocal sacs can be heard over away. Modern frog species (neobatrachians and some mesobatrachians) which lack vocal sacs tend to inhabit areas close to flowing water. The sound of the flowing water overpowers the advertisement call, so they must advertise by other means. An alternative use of the vocal sac is employed by the frogs of the family Rhinodermatidae. The males of the two species of this family scoop recently hatched tadpoles into their mouth, where they move into the vocal sac. The tadpoles of Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) remain in the vocal sac until metamorphosis, whereas the Chile Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma rufum) will transport the tadpoles to a water source.

This can include conditions such as spinal cord injuries, brain injuries, strokes, as well as pain or disability due to muscle, ligament or nerve damage. A physician having completed training in this field may be referred to as a physiatrist. Scope of the field Physical medicine and rehabilitation encompasses a variety of clinical settings and patient populations. In hospital settings, physiatrists commonly treat patients who have had an amputation, spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other debilitating injuries or conditions. In treating these patients, physiatrists lead an interdisciplinary team of physical, occupational, recreational and speech therapists, nurses, psychologists, and social workers. In outpatient settings, physiatrists treat patients with muscle and joint injuries, pain syndromes, non-healing wounds, and other disabling conditions. Physiatrists are trained to perform injections into joints or muscle as a pain treatment option. Physiatrists are also trained in nerve conduction studies and electromyography. History During the first half of the 20th century, two unofficial specialties, physical medicine and rehabilitation medicine, developed separately, but in practice both treated similar patient populations consisting of those with disabling injuries. Frank H. Krusen was a pioneer of physical medicine, which emphasized the use of physical agents, such as hydrotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen, at Temple University and then at Mayo Clinic and it was he that coined the term 'physiatry' in 1938. Rehabilitation medicine gained prominence during both World Wars in the treatment of injured soldiers and laborers. Howard A. Rusk, an internal medicine physician from Missouri, became a pioneer of rehabilitation medicine after being appointed to rehabilitate airmen during World War II. In 1944, the Baruch Committee, commissioned by philanthropist Bernard Baruch, defined the specialty as a combination of the two fields and laid the framework for its acceptance as an official medical specialty. The committee also distributed funds to establish training and research programs across the nation. The specialty that came to be known as physical medicine and rehabilitation in the United States was officially established in 1947, when an independent Board of Physical Medicine was established under the authority of the American Board of Medical Specialties. In 1949, at the insistence of Dr. Rusk and others, the specialty incorporated rehabilitation medicine and changed its name to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Treatment The major goal of physical medicine and rehabilitation treatment is to help a person function optimally within the limitations placed upon them by a disabling impairment or disease process for which there is no known cure. The emphasis is not on the full restoration to the premorbid level of function, but rather the optimization of the quality of life for those not able to achieve full restoration. A team approach to chronic conditions is emphasized to coordinate care of patients. Comprehensive rehabilitation is provided by specialists in this field, who act as facilitators, team leaders, and medical experts for rehabilitation. In rehabilitation, goal setting is often used by the clinical care team to provide the team and the person undergoing rehabilitation for an acquired disability a direction to work towards. Very low quality evidence indicates that goal setting may lead to a higher quality of life for the person with the disability, and it not clear if goal setting used in this context reduces or increases re-hospitalization or death. Not only must a physiatrist know medical knowledge regarding a patient's condition, but they also need to know practical knowledge regarding it as well. This involves issues such as: what type of wheelchair best suits the patient, what type of prosthetic would fit best, does their current house layout accommodate their handicap well, and other every day complications that their patients might have. Training In the United States, residency training for physical medicine and rehabilitation is four years long, including an intern year of general medical training. There are 83 programs in the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, in 28 states. Specifics of training differs from program to program but all residents must obtain the same fundamental skills. Residents are trained in the inpatient setting to take care of multiple types of rehabilitation including: spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, stroke, orthopedic injuries, cancer, cerebral palsy, burn, pediatric rehab, and other disabling injuries. The residents are also trained in the outpatient setting to know how to take care of the chronic conditions patients have following their inpatient stay. During training, residents are instructed on how to properly perform several diagnostic procedures which include electromyography, nerve conduction studies and also procedures such as joint injections and trigger point injections. Subspecialties Seven accredited sub- specializations are recognized in the United States: * Neuromuscular medicine * Pain medicine * Pediatric rehabilitation medicine * Spinal cord injury * Sports medicine * Brain injury * Hospice and palliative medicine Fellowship training for other unaccredited subspecialties within the field include the following: * Musculoskeletal/Spine * Stroke * Multiple sclerosis * Neurorehabilitation * Electrodiagnostic medicine * Cancer rehabilitation * Occupational and environmental medicine See also *American Osteopathic Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation *American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation References External links * What Is PM&R;? gives a physical medicine and rehabilitation resident's description of the specialty and its appeal as a physician ","title":"Physical medicine and rehabilitation"},{"id":"1119706","title":"Freeways (album)"},{"id":"1119713","text":"Jack Arnold Elder (born 3 July 1949) is a New Zealand former politician. He was an MP from 1984 to 1999, representing the Labour Party, New Zealand First and Mauri Pacific. Early life Jack Elder was born and raised in West Auckland, attending New Lynn Primary, Avondale Intermediate and Kelston Boys High School ‚Äì where he was head boy and captain of the rugby first fifteen.Profiling the events that shaped our community, 1967 (abstract), Western Leader, 11 February 2003, p. 5. Elder studied politics and history at the University of Auckland alongside future Prime Minister Helen Clark and future Minister of Defence Phil Goff. Elder was awarded a B.A in both History and Political Studies as well as a M.A in Political Studies. He then became a teacher at schools such as Henderson High School from 1974 to 1977 and Rutherford College from 1979 to 1981. He was a member of the New Lynn Borough Council from 1976 to 1983 including being elected Deputy Mayor in 1980. In 1975 he unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party candidacy for the electorate alongside 26 other aspirants following the retirement of Hugh Watt, but lost to Frank Rogers. In 1980 he put his name forward to replace long serving MP Warren Freer in the safe Labour seat of Mount Albert, but missed out on the nomination to Helen Clark. Member of Parliament Elder was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election as the Labour MP for , having previously made unsuccessful attempts in Helensville in the 1978 election and the 1981 election. He was re-elected in the 1987 election, the 1990 election, and in the 1993 election. In 1990, Elder was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. After the 1990 election he was appointed Shadow Minister of Agriculture by Mike Moore. Within the Labour Party, Elder was a staunch supporter of Moore, and belonged to the more economically liberal wing of the party. When Helen Clark replaced Moore as party leader, Elder remained aligned with Moore. Consequently he was ranked 40th on Labour's party list, the lowest of any sitting MP. In response he questioned his ties with Labour and position in parliament, not ruling out resining and forcing a by-election. Clark countered Elder's critiques saying Elder's list ranking reflected his lack of achievements as an MP. Elder bridled at Clark's comments, pointing to his 29 year membership and his time as Shadow Minister of Agriculture where he laboriously explained party policy to \\"incredulous farmers\\". He was clear that he didn't blame Clark and thought party processes and policies were responsible for his dissatisfaction. When suggestions arose that Moore would found a new party, Elder was considered likely to follow. In the end, Moore remained with Labour, but Elder was still dissatisfied. On 4 April 1996, Elder left the Labour Party to join New Zealand First, a centrist conservative party led by Winston Peters. National Coalition Government In the 1996 election, Elder was re-elected to Parliament as a list MP for New Zealand First, having unsuccessfully contested the Waipareira electorate. When New Zealand First formed a coalition with the governing National Party, Elder was appointed to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Police,Chronology of Roles, Ministerial Inquiry into INCIS, Ministry of Justice, November 2000., and Minister of Civil Defence. As Minister of Police Elder officially opened the Queenstown Police Station on Friday 10 July 1998. When New Zealand First's coalition with National began to collapse, however, Elder joined the group of MPs who quit New Zealand First and continued to offer support to the Government. He officially left New Zealand First on 18 August 1998. In exchange for his continued support for the government, Elder was allowed to remain Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Civil Defence, although he was no longer part of Cabinet. Later, Elder joined with four other former New Zealand First MPs to found the Mauri Pacific Party. Elder eventually chose not to seek re-election, and retired from politics at the 1999 election. Later life Elder spent time off from working, before returning to teaching two years after leaving Parliament.

In this protocol each resource is assigned a priority ceiling, which is a priority equal to the highest priority of any task which may lock the resource. The protocol works by temporarily raising the priorities of tasks in certain situations, thus it requires a scheduler that supports dynamic priority scheduling.  ICPP versus OCPP  There are two variants of the protocol: Original Ceiling Priority Protocol (OCPP) and Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol (ICPP). The worst-case behaviour of the two ceiling schemes is identical from a scheduling view point. Both variants work by temporarily raising the priorities of tasks. In OCPP, a task X's priority is raised when a higher-priority task Y tries to acquire a resource that X has locked. The task's priority is then raised to the priority ceiling of the resource, ensuring that task X quickly finishes its critical section, unlocking the resource. A task is only allowed to lock a resource if its dynamic priority is higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks. Otherwise the task becomes blocked, waiting for the resource. In ICPP, a task's priority is immediately raised when it locks a resource. The task's priority is set to the priority ceiling of the resource, thus no task that may lock the resource is able to get scheduled. This ensures the OCPP property that \\"A task can only lock a resource if its dynamic priority is higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks\\". * ICPP is easier to implement than OCPP, as blocking relationships need not be monitored * ICPP leads to fewer context switches as blocking is prior to first execution * ICPP requires more priority movements as this happens with all resource usage * OCPP changes priority only if an actual block has occurred ICPP is called \\"Ceiling Locking\\" in Ada, \\"Priority Protect Protocol\\" in POSIX and \\"Priority Ceiling Emulation\\" in RTSJ.

Historical studies have focused on numerous small-scale movements which are helpful in comparisons of Canadian and American politics. In the early years of the United States, many American political figures were in favour of invading and annexing Canada, and even pre-approved Canada's admission to the U.S. in the Articles of Confederation in 1777. The defeat of American attempts to achieve this goal, both in the American Revolution and the War of 1812, gradually led to the abandonment in the U.S. of any serious push toward annexation. As historian Joseph Levitt notes: :Since the Treaty of Washington in 1871, when it first de facto recognized the new Dominion of Canada, the United States has never suggested or promoted an annexationist movement in Canada. No serious force has appeared on the American political scene that aimed to persuade or coerce Canadians into joining the United States. And, in fact, no serious initiative for any move in this direction has come from the Canadian side either.Neuhold and Von Riekhoff, p. 94 Surveys have suggested that a minority of Canadians would potentially support annexation, ranging from as many as 20 percent in a survey by L√©ger Marketing in 2001Leger Marketing survey, 2001. to as few as seven percent in another survey by the same company in 2004.Leger Marketing survey, 2004. No elected member of any federal or provincial assembly in Canada, nor any mainstream politician in the United States, openly advocates annexation. Two minor provincial political parties in Canada promoted the concept in the 1980s, but neither attracted widespread support or attention. Historical annexationist groups 1837 Historical annexationist movements inside Canada were usually inspired by dissatisfaction with Britain's colonial government of Canada. Groups of Irish immigrants took the route of armed struggle, attempting to annex the peninsula between the Detroit and Niagara Rivers to the U.S. by force in the minor and short-lived Patriot War in 1837‚Äì1838. Although the Rebellions of 1837 were motivated in part by this type of dissatisfaction, Canadian resentment of British rule never reached the degree that led to the American Revolution in 1775. Notably, Canada's population growth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was spurred largely by United Empire Loyalists, who left the American colonies during the Revolution because of their loyalty to Great Britain. In the period from 1790 to 1837, imperial officials repeatedly denounced American-style republicanism and tried to suppress it. The Rebellions themselves were not fought with the goal of annexation, however, but were launched in pursuit of political independence from Britain and liberal social reforms. Between 1848 and 1854, a significant and articulate minority of conservatives in Upper Canada advocated constitutional changes modelled on the American federal-state system and the US Constitution. They critiqued Canada's imitation of British parliamentary government as both too democratic and too tyrannical. It destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and Legislative Council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. This critique led many conservatives to argue that the American model of checks and balances offered Canada a more balanced and conservative form of democracy than did British parliamentary government. These \\"republican conservatives\\" debated a series of constitutional changes, including annexation to the United States, an elected governor, an elected Legislative Council, a federal union of British North America, and imperial federation, within this framework. These conservatives had accepted \\"government by discussion\\" as the appropriate basis for political order.McNairn, Jeffrey L. \\"Publius of the North: Tory Republicanism and the American Constitution in Upper Canada, 1848-54.\\" Canadian Historical Review 1996 77(4): 504-537. ISSN 0008-3755. 1850s Around 1850 there was a serious annexationist movement on the border region of Quebec's Eastern Townships, where the American-descended majority felt that union with the United States would end their economic isolation and stagnation as well as remove them from the growing threat of French Canadian political domination. Leading proponents of this genuinely bipartisan movement were careful not to appear disloyal to Britain, however, and they actively discouraged popular protest at the local level. Fearful of American-style democracy, the local elite also expressed revulsion toward American slavery and militaristic expansionism. Consequently, the movement died as quickly in the Eastern Townships as it did in Montreal after Britain expressed its official disapproval and trade with the United States began to increase.Little, 1992 In Montreal at midcentury, with little immigration and complaints that the repeal of the Corn Laws had cut the region off from its British trade links, a small but organized group supported integrating the colonies into the United States. The leading organization advocating merger was the Annexation Association, founded in 1849 by an alliance of French Canadian nationalists and Anglophone businessmen in Montreal who had a common interest in the republic. Many of its members, including Louis-Joseph Papineau, were participants in the 1837-38 rebellions. The Montreal Annexation Manifesto was published in 1849. It was hoped a merger with the United States would give Canada markets for its goods, ensure national security, and provide the finances to develop the west. A half measure was the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 that linked the two areas economically. However, the movement died out in 1854. Annexation was never a very popular choice. Many Canadians were loyal to the Crown and Great Britain, especially the descendants of the United Empire Loyalists. French Canadians worried about being an even smaller minority in a larger union, and were concerned about American anti-Catholicism. The American Civil War, further, convinced many Canadians that the American experiment was a failure. 1860s British Columbia United States Secretary of State William Seward predicted in 1860 that western British North America, from Manitoba to British Columbia, would with Russian Alaska join the United States. Many in Britain, such as Goldwin Smith and The Times of London, were pessimistic about the future of British North America and agreed with Seward; The Times said that Britain would only object if the United States attempted to take the territory by force. In the late 1860s, residents of British Columbia, which was not yet a Canadian province, responded to the United States' purchase of Alaska with fear of being surrounded by American territory. Some residents wanted the colony to be the next American purchase. Local opinion was divided, as the three Vancouver Island newspapers supported annexation to the United States, while the three mainland newspapers rejected the idea. Even opponents of the annexation scheme admitted that Great Britain had neglected the region and that grievances were justified. Nonetheless, annexation sentiment disappeared within a few months and prominent leaders moved toward confederation with Canada. Petitions circulated in favour of American annexation. The first, in 1867, was addressed to Queen Victoria, demanding that the British government assume the colony's debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to President Ulysses S. Grant, asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by Vincent Colyer, Indian Commissioner for Alaska, on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871. Nova Scotia Most Canadians were strongly opposed to the prospect of American annexation. Reports of the Annexation Bill of 1866 ‚Äî a bill that, contrary to myth, never came to a vote ‚Äî might have been one of the many factors behind Canadian Confederation in 1867. Much more serious were the Fenian raids made by Irish Americans across the border in 1866, which spurred a wave of patriotic feeling that helped the cause of Confederation.Donald Creighton, John A. Macdonald: The Young Politician 1952 pp 438-43 Nonetheless, a substantial annexation movement existed in Nova Scotia, and to a lesser degree in New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario, during the 1860s. Nova Scotia anti- confederationists led by Joseph Howe felt that pro-confederation premier Charles Tupper had caused the province to agree to join Canada without popular support. Howe in London unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the government to free Nova Scotia from the pending British North America Act by threatening American annexation. A significant economic downturn occurred after the end after 1866 of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854; the colony was heavily dependent on selling fish to Americans, causing many to believe that free trade with the United States was necessary for prosperity. Anti-confederationists won all but two seats in the 1867 provincial election; as in British Columbia they did not necessarily support annexation. They again sent Howe to London to free Nova Scotia but in 1868 the British government again refused, believing that New Brunswick would likely follow Nova Scotia out of the dominion and cause the new nation to collapse. Angry Nova Scotians began talking seriously of annexation. An alarmed Howe--who wished Nova Scotia to be free of Canada but still with Britain--warned his supporters against disloyalty, dividing anti- confederationists. The provincial government, dominated by extremists who now also opposed Howe, decided that if another appeal to London failed it would seize federal offices and unilaterally declare annexation, believing that Britain would not use force to stop Nova Scotia. Believing he had no choice, Howe left the anti-confederationists. Although he narrowly won reelection to his federal parliamentary seat in March 1869 as a confederationist, support for secession and annexation grew that year; however, by 1871 the movement had mostly disappeared. The federal government promised changes to taxes and tariffs, the economy revived, and the United States agreed to free trade for Canadian fish. 1880s Canadian author Prosper Bender wrote in the North American Review in 1883 that many Canadians believed that annexation by the United States would occur \\"within the present generation, if not sooner\\". He believed that Irish Catholics--about one quarter of Canada's population--would prefer annexation because of the British rule of Ireland. They would be joined by the majority of those under 40, who viewed the United States as a prosperous, fast-growing neighbour providing many opportunities. (The author attributed the absence of an active annexation movement in part to many who would favor such an effort taking the \\"easiest and quietest method of securing the benefits of annexation, by themselves silently migrating to the Republic\\", as more than a million already had.) Bender believed that Prime Minister John A. Macdonald's promise of a transcontinental railway linking eastern Canada to British Columbia to be overambitious and too expensive, and unfavourably compared the Canadian government's growing debt to the United States' rapid reduction of its Civil War debt. He stated that Canadian businesses would benefit from duty-free access to the American market, while \\"wondrous American enterprise, supported by illimitable capital\\" would rapidly prosper Canada, especially its vast undeveloped interior. Bender concluded with pessimism about the likelihood of success of a nation divided in two parts by 1,200 miles of \\"forbidding, silent wilderness stretching from the head-waters of the Ottawa to Thunder Bay, and thence to Manitoba\\". 1890s In 1891, Goldwin Smith posited in his book Canada and the Canadian Question that Canada's eventual annexation by the United States was inevitable, and should be welcomed if Canadians genuinely believed in the ideal of democracy. His view did not receive widespread support.Kelly, St√©phane. \\"The Republic of Northern America\\" Toronto Star; Opinion (Canada 2020). 26 December 2006. In January 1893, concerned about Canada's possible annexation, a goal then being pursued by the Continental Union Association, a group of Ontario and Quebec Liberals, Prime Minister Sir John Thompson delivered a speech on tolerance, Canadian nationalism and continued loyalty to Britain. Thompson eventually learned that the desire to make Canada part of the U.S. was confined to a small minority amongst the Liberals. 1900s In 1901 W. T. Stead, a newspaper editor in London, England, discussed in The Americanization of the World possible annexations of Canada and Newfoundland. He believed that because of its size and strength Canada would likely be the last of Britain's possessions in the Americas to join the United States. Stead cited several reasons for why he believed annexation seemed \\"inevitable\\", however, including rapidly growing economic ties and migration between the two countries, the French Shore, and disputes over the Alaska boundary and fishing rights in the Atlantic. After the discovery of gold in the Yukon, many Canadians propose to annex parts of Alaska currently controlled by the United States, by calling for a revision in the original map of the boundary line between the Russian Empire and the United States. The US offered to lease the territory but not to give it back. London and Washington agreed on arbitration, with one member of the panel from Canada. In 1903 the Chief Justice of Britain sided with the Americans to resolve the map dispute in favour of the United States. Many Canadians felt a sense of betrayal on the part of the British government, whose own national interest required close ties to the United States, regardless of the interests of Canada.F. W. Gibson, \\"The Alaskan Boundary Dispute,\\" Canadian Historical Association Report (1945) pp 25‚Äì40 at note 57 The 1932 establishment of the International Peace Garden on the North Dakota‚ÄìManitoba border honored the long lasting friendship between the two countries rather than attempts at annexation. Newfoundland in the mid-twentieth century While the Dominion of Newfoundland was still separate from Canada, during World War II, a party known as the Economic Union Party sought closer ties with the United States. However, Canada objected to the possibility, and the British government, which controlled Newfoundland as a colony, would not allow it to consider annexation with the United States in any referendum. Instead, the EUP sought an independent \\"responsible government\\" that would then explore American annexation.Karl McNeil Earle, \\"Cousins of a Kind: The Newfoundland and Labrador Relationship with the United States\\" American Review of Canadian Studies, Vol. 28, 1998 A referendum showed a plurality in support of independence, but not a majority; a runoff referendum resulted in Newfoundland instead confederating with Canada to become the tenth province. Modern annexationist groups Two modern provincial political parties have proposed that their province secede from Canada to join the United States. Neither attracted significant support. The Unionest Party was a provincial political party in Saskatchewan in 1980 that promoted the union of the western provinces with the United States. It was the most politically successful annexationist group, but its success was both short-lived and extremely limited in scope. The party briefly had two members in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, both of whom crossed the floor from another party, but dissolved within a few weeks after failing to qualify for official party status.Stephen LaRose, \\"It's All About the Crude\\". Planet S, March 26, 2009. The original Parti 51 was a short-lived political party in Quebec in the 1980s that advocated Quebec's admission to the United States as the 51st state. The party won just 3,846 votes, or 0.11 per cent of the popular vote in the province, in the 1989 election ‚Äî fewer votes than the Marxist‚ÄìLeninists or the satirical Lemon Party ‚Äî and was dissolved the following year.Jean Cr√™te, \\"La vie des partis\\". L'ann√©e politique au Qu√©bec 1989-1990, Les Presses de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al. In 2016 Hans Mercier, a pro-American lawyer from Saint-Georges, Quebec, revived the party for a second time. Mercier told La Presse that the times have changed since the party's previous era, as Quebec sovereigntism has waned in popularity. Mercier argued that Americans would be welcoming of a new Quebec state, and pointed to a survey taken during the administration of George W. Bush that suggested nearly 34 per cent of Quebecers would support joining the United States. The revived party ran five candidates and received just 1,117 votes provincewide in the 2018 Quebec general election, representing 0.03 per cent of the provincewide popular vote. Anti-annexation rhetoric In modern Canadian political discourse, the idea of Canada becoming the \\"51st state\\" of the United States is much more often used as a scare tactic against political courses of action that may be seen as too \\"Americanizing\\". The use of this type of rhetoric may occur even if the proponents of such a course of action have not endorsed or proposed annexation. In the 1911 federal election, the Conservative response to the proposed reciprocity treaty negotiated by the Liberals was to denounce it as equivalent to an American economic takeover, with annexation likely to follow. The parties swapped position in the later 1988 federal election, when the Liberals used the same type of rhetoric to denounce the Progressive Conservatives' proposed Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement, although the Progressive Conservatives won that election and the agreement was implemented. Annexation fears can be found throughout Canadian History for Dummies, in which humourist Will Ferguson stated that for \\"John L. O'Sullivan, it was the \\"manifest destiny\\" of the United States to annex and possess all of North America\\".Will Ferguson, Canadian History for Dummies. pp. 211, 206, 220, 269. In fact, O'Sullivan's use of the term never extended beyond potential American annexation of Texas and the Oregon Territory; he explicitly wrote that he did not believe that the United States had a destiny to annex Canada.New York Morning News, December 27, 1845. Reverse annexation Political satirists, including the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, have occasionally proposed reverse annexation, whereby all or part the United States would be annexed into an expanded Canadian federation. Following the 2004 American election, some Americans distributed the satirical Jesusland map on the Internet, depicting a similar proposal under which the \\"blue states\\" were part of a new political entity called \\"The United States of Canada\\". Montana In 2019, there was a petition calling for the US to sell Montana to Canada to pay off the US debt.https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/petition-calls- for-u-s-to-sell-montana-to- canada-1.4306271https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/20/montana- canada-lawmakers-resolution-trillion-deficit/2929304002/ Notes References * Angus, H.

Comparable towers may be found elsewhere in the Caucasus, specifically in Ingushetia. The auls are generally built out of stone, on faces of ridges or against cliffs in order to provide protection against surprise attacks. Houses are usually two stories high, and they are staggered to make it virtually impossible for enemies to get anywhere on the roads. The houses usually have a southern aspect to take advantage of the sun in the winter and to be sheltered from the northern winds. Often, they are not located near good farmland or water sources, so it is necessary to bring water into the settlement. In the 19th century, as Russia fought to conquer the Caucasus, auls were very formidable defences and could be taken for the most part only by storming.

He was an MP from 1996 to 1999, first as a member of the New Zealand First party and then as an independent. Before the splintering of New Zealand First, he was known as its leading dissident. Early life and education Born on 16 May 1956, Kirton was educated at Sacred Heart College, Auckland, and the University of Otago, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1978 and a Postgraduate Diploma in Science with first-class honours in 1979. Member of Parliament Kirton was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as a New Zealand First list MP, having contested the electorate. When New Zealand First formed a coalition with the governing National Party, Kirton was appointed Associate Minister of Health. Kirton soon became disillusioned with this arrangement, however, disliking the National Party's health policies. He became increasingly critical of his party's coalition with National, and in August 1997, he was fired from his role as Associate Minister of Health after quarreling bitterly with the Minister of Health, Bill English. Kirton accused English of breaching the coalition agreement between National and New Zealand First, and called National \\"untrustworthy\\" and \\"deceitful\\". He then launched an unsuccessful campaign within New Zealand First to break off the coalition and come to an arrangement with the Labour Party. On 24 October, it was announced that Kirton would not be seeking renomination for New Zealand First, with Kirton saying that the party had lost its principles. Kirton did not resign from the party, however, deciding to remain a member until the end of the Parliamentary term. He therefore remained a dissident, and frequently criticised the party's leader, Winston Peters. He also continued to attack National's health policies. He attacked his replacement as Associate Minister of Health, New Zealand First's Tuariki Delamere, as a liar, and accused him of tamely accepting whatever the National Party wished. By the middle of the following year, however, matters had reached the point where Kirton's position in the party was no longer tenable, and on 28 July 1998, Kirton quit the party to become an independent. This deprived the government of its majority, leaving Parliament evenly split between the government and the opposition. As a result, the government was forced to do a deal with the United New Zealand party. Later, when the coalition between New Zealand First and National finally collapsed, the government's majority became even more precarious, but it nevertheless managed to survive until the end of the term. Local politics Kirton did not seek re-election in the 1999 election, instead going into local politics. He was elected as the top-polling candidate in the Napier ward for both the 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 local body elections on the Hawke's Bay Regional Council. He retired from local politics at the 2013 local body election, as was appointed as chief executive of the New Zealand Cancer Society's Central Division.

Today, it is identified with El-Koursi or Kursi. It is mentioned in some ancient manuscripts of the Gospel of Matthew as the place where the Miracle of the Swine took place, an exorcism performed by Jesus who drove demons out of two possessed men and into a herd of pigs. All three Synoptic Gospels mention this miracle, but only Matthew writes about two possessed men instead of just one, and only some manuscripts of his Gospel name the location as Gergesa, while the other copies, as well as all versions of Luke and Mark, mention either Gadara or Gerasa (see ). Some are of the opinion that Gergesa was the country of the ancient Girgashites; but it is more probable that 'Gergesenes' was introduced by Origen upon mere conjecture; as before him most copies seem to have read 'Gadarenes', agreeable to the parallel passages and the ancient Syriac version. In any event, the \\"country of the Gergesenes/Gadarenes/Gerasenes\\" in the New Testament Gospels refers to some location on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The name is derived from either a lakeside village, Gergesa, the next larger city, Gadara, or the best-known city in the region, Gerasa. Interpretations Gergesenes means \\"those who come from pilgrimage or fight.\\" Many New Testament manuscripts refer to the \\"Country of the Gadarenes\\" or \\"Gerasenes\\" rather than the Gergesenes. Both Gerasa and Gadara were cities to the east of the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan. They were both Gentile cities filled with citizens who were culturally more Greek than Semitic; this would account for the pigs in the biblical account. Gerasa and Gadara are accounted for in historical accounts (by writers such as Pliny the Elder and Josephus) and by archaeological research. Today they are the modern towns of Jerash and Umm Qais. A third city, Hippos, was similar in character to Gadara and Gerasa, and it may fit the biblical account even better. It was located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, whereas Gerasa and Gadara were several kilometers south-east of it. Hippos, Gerasa, and Gadara were all counted in the Decapolis, an informal grouping of Greco-Roman cities just south of the ancient city of Caesarea Philippi. Identification with Kursi Byzantine Christian monks venerated a site situated a few kilometres north of Hippos on the lake shore, as the location of the miracle. It is the only place fitting Matthew's description, since it contains the only \\"steep bank\\" in the area descending all the way to the shore of the lake. The site became apparently known since at least the Early Muslim period as Kursya,Harry M. Jol, Gloria I.

Gogol Bordello is an American punk rock band from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, formed in 1999 by musicians from all over the world and known for theatrical stage shows and persistent touring. Much of the band's sound is inspired by gypsy music mixed with punk and dub, incorporating accordion and violin (and on some albums, saxophone). The band has appeared in several popular films, most notably Everything Is Illuminated (2005) in which lead singer Eugene H√ºtz co-starred with Elijah Wood in a dramedy/adventure story about the Nazi purges in Ukraine. The group appears playing a brass band in a set that included the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" and the traditional Yiddish song \\"Bublitschki\\". Gogol Bordello contributed the song \\"Start Wearing Purple\\" to the film's score. The band is the focus of the 2008 documentary Gogol Bordello Non-Stop. The band recorded the song \\"Let's Get Crazy\\" for Coca-Cola's Euro 2012 advertising campaign. History and influences \\"Gogol\\" comes from Nikolai Gogol, a classical Russian writer of Ukrainian origin. He serves as an ideological influence for the band because he \\"smuggled\\" Ukrainian culture into Russian society, which Gogol Bordello intends to do with Gypsy/East-European music in the English-speaking world. \\"Bordello\\", in Italian, refers to a brothel or a \\"gentleman's club\\". The band was originally titled H√ºtz and the B√©la Bart√≥ks, but Eugene H√ºtz says that they decided to change the name because \\"nobody knows who the hell B√©la Bart√≥k is in the United States.\\" The band played their first show as the unofficial band at an after-hours club called Pizdetz where they became the house band and DJ H√ºtz became the house DJ. Gogol Bordello's first single was released in 1999, and since then they have released six full- length albums, and one EP. In 2005 the band signed to punk label SideOneDummy Records. On 27 April 2010 Gogol Bordello made its major record label debut with Transcontinental Hustle on Rick Rubin's American Recordings, a subsidiary of Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment. Many of the songs on Transcontinental Hustle were inspired by H√ºtz's move to Brazil. The band has toured extensively throughout Europe and America. They have made numerous appearances at international festivals and have toured with such diverse bands as Primus, Flogging Molly, and Cake. In an interview with NPR, frontman Eugene H√ºtz cites Jimi Hendrix and Parliament-Funkadelic as among the band's main musical influences. They have also mentioned Manu Chao, Fugazi, Zvuki Mu, Karamelo Santo, Sasha Kolpakov and The Clash as influences. They performed live at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival 2011 for Bonnaroo's 10 year anniversary, playing a 1.5 hour set in the middle of the night and performed with Devotchka. Gogol Bordello released \\"Let's Get Crazy\\" in 2012, the new song was part of Coca-Cola's advertising campaign for the European Football Championships, which were part-hosted by Ukraine. The track samples one of their earlier singles, \\"Wonderlust King,\\" and the Coca-Cola advertising jingle. In 2012 former guitarist Oren Kaplan sued H√ºtz for personal damages. The 2010 song \\"Immigraniada\\" was remixed by Bassnectar becoming a smash hit amongst his fans hoping for a live performance anytime the band and he are in proximity to each other.

During the middle of the 19th century, it formed a prominent and well-known landmark on the Oregon, Mormon, and California emigrant trails. Many of these emigrants carved their names on it, and it was described by early missionary and explorer Father Pierre-Jean De Smet in 1840 as the Register of the Desert. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 20, 1961 and is now part of Independence Rock State Historic Site, owned and operated by the state of Wyoming. Description The rock is a large rounded monolith of Archean granite typical of the surrounding region and is an isolated peak at the southeast end of the Granite Mountains. Its appearance is somewhat like the rounded Enchanted Rock of Texas or Uluru in Australia (formerly known as Ayers Rock), although smaller in size. It is located in the high plateau region of central Wyoming, north of the Sentinel Rocks ridge and adjacent to the Sweetwater River.Independence Rock, Wyoming, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1951 It is accessible from a rest area on Wyoming Highway 220, approximately northeast of Muddy Gap and south-west of Casper. History The rock derives its name from the fact that it lies directly along the route of the Emigrant Trail. Pioneering wagon parties bound for Oregon or California usually left the Missouri River in the early spring and hoped to reach the rock by July 4 (Independence Day in the United States), in order to reach their destinations before the first mountain snowfalls. John C. Fr√©mont camped a mile below this site on August 1, 1843 and made this entry in the journal of his 1843-'44 expedition:Fremont, John, et al., Report of the exploring expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the year 1842, Gales and Seaton, printers, 1845 > Everywhere within six or eight feet of the ground, where the surface is > sufficiently smooth, and in some places sixty or eighty feet above, the rock > is inscribed with the names of travelers. Many a name famous in the history > of this country, and some well known to science, are to be found among those > of traders and travelers. Fremont carved a large cross into the rock monolith, which was blasted off the rock on July 4, 1847 by hundreds of California and Oregon emigrants who had gathered on the site.Wyoming: A Guide to Its History, Highways and People (American Guide Series), Native American Books Distributor, 2007, pp. 386-7 Some Protestants considered the cross to be a symbol of the Pope and Catholicism.

This type of expression has been widely practiced in China and has been generally held in high esteem across East Asia. Calligraphy is considered as one of the four best friends of ancient Chinese literati, along with playing stringed musical instruments, the board game \\"Go\\", and painting. There are some general standardizations of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley- Baker, \\"Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients.\\" Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including seal carving, ornate paperweights, and inkstones.  Characteristics  In China, calligraphy is referred to as sh≈´f«é or f«ésh≈´ (Êõ∏Ê≥ï/‰π¶Ê≥ï, Ê≥ïÊõ∏/Ê≥ï‰π¶), literally 'way/method/law of writing';Êõ∏ being here used as in Ê•∑‰π¶/Ê•∑Êõ∏, etc., and meaning 'writing style'. shod≈ç () in Japan ('way/principle of writing'); and seoye (ÏÑúÏòà; Êõ∏Ëóù) in Korea ('skill/criterion of writing').

Chinese calligraphy focuses not only on methods of writing but also on cultivating one's character (‰∫∫ÂìÅ) and taught as a pursuit (ÔºçÊõ∏Ê≥ï; , rules of writing Han charactersShu Xincheng ËàíÊñ∞Âüé, ed. Cihai (Ëæ≠Êµ∑ 'Sea of Words'). 3 vols. Shanghai: Zhonghua. 1936.).  Chinese script styles   Oracle bone script  Oracle bone fragment, Shang dynasty (ca. 1600‚Äì1046 B.C.), China, Bone Oracle bone script was an early form of Chinese characters written on animals' bones. Written on oracle bones ‚Äì animal bones or turtle plastrons ‚Äì it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. The first appearance of what we recognize unequivocally to refer as \\"oracle bone inscriptions\\" comes in the form of inscribed ox scapulae and turtle plastrons from sites near modern Anyang (ÂÆâÈò≥) on the northern border of Henan province. The vast majority were found at the Yinxu site in this region. They record pyromantic divinations of the last nine kings of the Shang dynasty, beginning with Wu Ding, whose accession is dated by different scholars at 1250 BC or 1200 BC. Though there is no proof that the Shang dynasty was solely responsible for the origin of writing in China, neither is there evidence of recognizable Chinese writing from any earlier time or any other place. The late Shang oracle bone writings constitute the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing and it is also the oldest known member and ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts, preceding the Chinese bronze inscriptions.  Chinese Bronze Inscriptions  Chinese bronze inscriptions were usually written on the Chinese ritual bronzes. These Chinese ritual bronzes include Ding (Èºé), Dui (Êï¶), Gu (Ëßö), Guang (Ëß•), Gui (Á∞ã), Hu (Â£∫), Jia (Êñù), Jue (Áàµ), Yi (Âåú), You (Âç£), Zun (Â∞ä), and Yi (ÂΩù). Different time periods used different methods of inscription. Shang bronze inscriptions were nearly all cast at the same time as the implements on which they appear. In later dynasties such as Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn Period, the inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast. Bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the Chinese family of scripts, preceded by the oracle bone script.  Seal script  a specific example of Chinese Character Êú® (a tree) written in Seal script Seal script (Chinese: ÁØÜÊõ∏; pinyin: zhu√†nsh≈´) is an ancient style of writing Chinese characters that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It evolved organically out of the Zhou dynasty script. The Qin variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the Qin dynasty.  Clerical script  Memorial to Yueyang Tower by Fan Zhongyan, Song Dynasty The Clerical script (traditional Chinese: Èö∏Êõ∏; simplified Chinese: Èö∂‰π¶; pinyin: l√¨sh≈´) is an archaic style of Chinese calligraphy. The clerical script was first used during the Han dynasty and has lasted up to the present. The clerical script is considered a form of modern script though it was replaced by the standard script relatively early. This occurred because the graphic forms written in mature clerical script closely resemble those written in standard script. The clerical script is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications because of its high legibility for reading.  Regular script  Regular script (traditional Chinese: Ê•∑Êõ∏; simplified Chinese: Ê•∑‰π¶; pinyin: k«éish≈´; Hong Kong and Taiwan still use traditional Chinese characters in writing, while mainland China uses simplified Chinese characters as the official script. ) is the newest of the Chinese script styles. The regular script first came into existence between the Han and Wei dynasties, even though it is not popular. The regular script became mature stylistically around the 7th century. The first master of regular script is Zhong You. Zhong You first used regular script to write some very serious pieces such as memorials to the emperor.  Semi-cursive script  Semi-cursive script (simplified Chinese: Ë°å‰π¶; traditional Chinese: Ë°åÊõ∏; pinyin: X√≠ngsh≈´), is a cursive style of Chinese characters. Because it is not as abbreviated as cursive, most people who can read regular script can read semi-cursive. It is highly useful and also artistic.  Cursive script (East Asia)  Cursive script (simplified Chinese: Ëçâ‰π¶; traditional Chinese: ËçâÊõ∏; pinyin: c«éosh≈´) originated in China during the Han dynasty through the Jin period (link needed). The cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. The \\"grass\\" in Chinese was also used in the sense of \\"coarse, rough; simple and crude.\\" It would appear that c«éo in the term caoshu \\"grass script\\" was used in this same sense. The term c«éosh≈´ has broad and narrow meanings. In the broad sense, it is non-temporal and can refer to any characters which have been hastily written. In the narrow sense, it refers to the specific handwriting style in Han dynasty.  History  Ancient China Chinese characters can be retraced to 4000 B.C. signs (). In 2003, at the site of Xiaoshuangqiao (Â∞èÂèåÊ°•), about 20 km southeast of the ancient Zhengzhou Shang City, ceramic inscriptions dating to 1435‚Äì1412 B.C. have been found by archaeologists. These writings are made in cinnabar paint. Thus, the dates of writing in China have been confirmed for the Middle Shang period.Song Guoding (2004), The Cinnabar Inscriptions Discovered at the Xiaoshuangqiao Site, Zhengzhou. Chinese Archaeology. Volume 4, Issue 1, Pages 98‚Äì102 The ceramic ritual vessel vats that bear these cinnabar inscriptions were all unearthed within the palace area of this site. They were unearthed mostly in the sacrificial pits holding cow skulls and cow horns, but also in other architectural areas. The inscriptions are written on the exterior and interior of the rim, and the exterior of the belly of the large type of vats. The characters are mostly written singly; character compounds or sentences are rarely seen. The contemporary Chinese character's set principles were clearly visible in ancient China's Ji«ég«îw√©n characters(Áî≤È™®Êñá) carved on ox scapulas and tortoise plastrons around 14th - 11th century BCE (). Brush-written examples decay over time and have not survived. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved (Keightley, 1978). Each archaic kingdom of current China continued to revise its set of characters. Imperial China On Calligraphy by Mi Fu, Song DynastyPoems of The four treasures in a scholar's study (Qing dynasty) For more than 2,000 years, China's literati‚ÄîConfucian scholars and literary men who also served the government as officials‚Äîhave been connoisseurs and practitioners of this art. In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles ‚Äî some dating from 200 BC, and in Xi«éozhu√†n style (small seal script) ‚Äî are still accessible. In about 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang(Áß¶ÂßãÁöá, 259‚Äì210 BC), the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si's (ÊùéÊñØ, 246 BC - 208 BC) character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized Xi«éozhu√†n characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, little paper survives from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles. The L√¨sh≈´ style (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under Qin Shi Huang.Blakney, p6 : While it is a common mistake to believe that Lishu was created by Cheng Miao alone during Qing Shi Huang's regime, Lishu was developed from pre-Qin era to the Han dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). During the fourth century AD, calligraphy came to full maturity. The K«éish≈´ style (traditional regular script) ‚Äî still in use today ‚Äî and attributed to Wang Xizhi (ÁéãÁæ≤‰πã, 303 CE-361 AD) and his followers, is even more regularized. reached its peak in the Tang Dynasty, when famous calligraphers like Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan produced most of the fine works in Kaishu. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926 CE -933 AD), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of Âπø which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.Â∫∑ÁÜôÂ≠óÂÖ∏ Kangxi Zidian, 1716. Scanned version available at www.kangxizidian.com. See for example the radicals Âç©, ÂéÇ or Âπø, p.41. The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on the Kangxi Zidian p.41 clearly allow the stroke order to be determined. Cursive styles such as X√≠ngsh≈´ (semi- cursive or running script) and C«éosh≈´ (cursive or sloppy script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, at the same time as Regular script (Han Dynasty 202 BC-220 AD), but X√≠ngsh≈´ and C«éosh≈´ were used for personal notes only and were never used as a standard. Caoshu style was highly appreciated during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (140 BC‚àí87 BC). Styles which did not survive include BƒÅfƒìnsh≈´, a mix of 80% Xiaozhuan style and 20% Lishu. Some Variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, were incorporated in the Simplified Chinese character set.  Hard-pen calligraphy  This way of writing started to develop in the 1900s when fountain pens were imported into China from the west. Writing with fountain pens remained a convenience until the 1980s. With the Reform and Open, public focused on practicing hard-pen calligraphy. People usually use Chinese simplified characters in semi-cursive or regular style. Printed and computer styles Examples of modern printed styles are Song from the Song Dynasty's printing press, and sans-serif. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

They are known together as the Four Treasures of the Study. In addition to these four tools, a water-dropper, desk pads and paperweights are also used by calligraphers. A Chinese calligraphy set, Gurgaon, near Delhi, India  Brush  A brush is the traditional writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair, such as weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm. Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen.  Paper  Calligraphy tools Paper is frequently sold together with a paperweight and desk pad. Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as Xuan paper, Maobian paper, Lianshi paper etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, Xuan paper became well known by most of Chinese calligraphers. In China, Xuanzhi (ÂÆ£Á¥ô), traditionally made in Anhui province, is the preferred type of paper. It is made from the Tatar wingceltis (Pteroceltis tatarianovii), as well as other materials including rice, the paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera), bamboo, hemp, etc. In Japan, washi is made from the kozo (paper mulberry), ganpi (Wikstroemia sikokiana), and mitsumata (Edgeworthia papyrifera), as well as other materials such as bamboo, rice, and wheat.  Paperweights  Paperweights are used to hold down paper. A paperweight is often placed at the top of all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed at the bottom of the page for support. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.  Desk pads  The desk pad (Chinese T: Áï´Ê∞à, S: ÁîªÊØ°, Pinyin: hu√†zhƒÅn; Japanese: ‰∏ãÊï∑ shitajiki) is a pad made of felt. Some are printed with grids on both sides, so that when it is placed under the translucent paper, it can be used as a guide to ensure correct placement and size of characters. However, these printed pads are used only by students. Both desk pads and the printed grids come in a variety of sizes.  Ink and inkstick  Using an ink stick and inkstone Brush-washers for removing excess ink are essential tools in the traditional art of Chinese calligraphy. The Walters Art Museum. Ink is made from lampblack (soot) and binders, and comes in inksticks which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks are more prone to bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.  Inkstone  Commonly made from stone, ceramic, or clay, an inkstone is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. Chinese inkstones are highly prized as art objects and an extensive bibliography is dedicated to their history and appreciation, especially in China.  Seal and seal paste  Using seal paste with a Chinese seal Calligraphic works are usually completed by the calligrapher applying one or more seals in red ink. The seal can serve the function of a signature.  Technique  The shape, size, stretch, and type of hair in the brush, the color and density of the ink, as well as the absorptive speed and surface texture of the paper are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher also influences the result by the quantity of ink/water he lets the brush take up, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, acceleration and deceleration of the writer's moves and turns, and the stroke order give \\"spirit\\" to the characters by influencing greatly their final shape. The \\"spirit\\" is referred to yi in Chinese calligraphy. Yi means \\"intention or idea\\" in Chinese. The more practice a calligrapher has, his or her technique will transfer from youyi (intentionally making a piece of work) to wuyi (creating art with unintentional moves). Wuyi is considered as a higher stage for calligraphers, which require the calligrapher to have perfect control over the brush and wrist and following his or her heart. Study Traditionally, the bulk of the study of calligraphy is composed of copying strictly exemplary works from the apprentice's master or from reputed calligraphers, thus learning them by rote. The master showing the 'right way' to draw items, which the apprentice have to copy strictly, continuously, until the move becomes instinctive and the copy perfect. Deviation from the model is seen as a failure. Competency in a particular style often requires many years of practice. Correct strokes, stroke order, character structure, balance, and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. A student would also develop their skills in traditional Chinese arts, as familiarity and ability in the arts contributes to their calligraphy. Since the development of regular script, nearly all calligraphers have started their study by imitating exemplary models of regular script. A beginning student may practice writing the character Ê∞∏ (, eternal) for its abundance of different kinds of strokes and difficulty in construction. The Eight Principles of Yong refers to the eight different strokes in the character, which some argue summarizes the different strokes in regular script. How the brush is held depends on the calligrapher and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches the upper part of the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script. In Japan, smaller pieces of Japanese calligraphy are traditionally written while in seiza. In modern times, however, writers frequently practice calligraphy seated on a chair at a table. Larger pieces may be written while standing; in this case the paper is usually placed directly on the floor, but some calligraphers use an easel. Basic calligraphy instruction is part of the regular school curriculum in both China and Japan and specialized programs of study exist at the higher education level in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In contemporary times, debate emerged on the limits of this copyist tradition within the modern art scenes, where innovation is the rule, while changing lifestyles, tools, and colors are also influencing new waves of masters. Chinese calligraphy is being promoted in Chinese schools to counter Character amnesia brought on by technology usage. In recent study, Chinese calligraphy writing have been used as cognitive intervention strategy among older adults or people with mild cognitive impairment. For example, in a recent randomized control trial experiment, calligraphy writing enhanced both working memory and attention control compared to controlled groups. In contemporary China, a small but significant number of practitioners have made calligraphy their profession, and provincial and national professional societies exist, membership in which conferring considerable prestige.For example, the China Calligraphers Association (‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰π¶Ê≥ïÂÆ∂Âçè‰ºö, ) is a national organization. By tradition, the price of a particular artist's work is priced in terms of the length of paper on which it is written. Works by well-regarded contemporary calligraphers may fetch thousands to tens of thousands of yuan (renminbi) per chi (a unit of length, roughly equal to a foot) of artwork. As with other artwork, the economic value of calligraphy has increased in recent years as the newly-rich in China search for safe investments for their wealth. Rules of Modern Calligraphy While appreciating calligraphy will depend on individual preferences, there are established traditional rules and those who repeatedly violate them are not considered legitimate calligraphers. The famous modern Chinese calligrapher Tian Yunzhang, member of the Chinese Calligrapher Association, summarized rules of modern calligraphy. The following citation are from the video collection regarded as great reference for calligraphy learners, in which Tian made deep analysis of different characters. Among these rules are: *The characters must be written correctly. A correctly written character is composed in a way that is accepted as correct by legitimate calligraphers. Calligraphic works often use variant Chinese characters, which are deemed correct or incorrect case-by-case, but in general, more popular variants are more likely to be correct. Correct characters are written in the traditional stroke order and not a modern standard. *The characters must be legible. As calligraphy is the method of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to those familiar with the script style, although it may be illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read cursive, but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if those familiar with cursive can read it. *The characters must be concise. This is in contrast to Western calligraphy where flourishes are acceptable and often desirable. Good Chinese calligraphy must be unadorned script. It must also be in black ink unless there is a reason to write in other ink. *The characters must fit their context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education contributed to their calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with the rhythm of the phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy. *The characters must be aesthetically pleasing. Generally, characters that are written correctly, legibly, concisely, and in the correct context are also aesthetically pleasing to some degree. Characters that violate the above rules are often less aesthetically pleasing. An experienced calligrapher will consider the quality of the line, the structure of each character which the lines are placed, the compositional organization of groups of characters. Throughout the work, the brush line of light or dark, dry or wet should record the process of the artist creating the work vividly.  Influences   Calligraphy in Japan and Korea  The Japanese and Koreans have developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences, as well as applying to specific scripts. Japanese calligraphy extends beyond Han characters to also include local scripts such as hiragana and katakana. In the case of Korean calligraphy, the Hangeul and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique.Daikynguyen.com  Other arts  Water calligraphy or ground calligraphy is a popular pastime in China. The existence of temporary calligraphy, or water calligraphy, is also to be noted. This is the practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. Calligraphy has influenced ink and wash painting, which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in East Asia, including Ink and wash painting, a style of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean painting based entirely on calligraphy.

Edwards actually started his early career as a youth player with Leyton Orient in London, as his father was an Orient supporter. He became homesick and joined Sheffield United. A prolific goalscorer, he had two spells (1975‚Äì1978 and 1981‚Äì1986) at Sheffield United for whom he scored 171 goals in 293 appearances. Whilst with the Blades, he was the highest scoring player in a division twice, scoring 36 goals (one for Hull City) in Division 4 in 1981‚Äì82 and 33 goals in Division 3 in 1983‚Äì84. The latter haul earned Edwards his second Adidas Golden Boot award. His debut for United came in a FA Cup Third Round Tie against Leicester City on 3 January 1976 and his League debut came on 28 February 1976 in a Division 1 game against Queens Park Rangers. However, his first goal didn't arrive until the next season in Division 2 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24 August 1976. In between his time at Bramall Lane he played for Hull City who paid ¬£50,000 for Edwards in 1978. Ian Porterfield bought him back for ¬£100,000 and played him for the first time against Scunthorpe United on 26 September 1981, the 1‚Äì0 home victory being the first of a 17-game unbeaten run. Edwards scored his first two goals under Porterfield in a 4‚Äì0 win over Crewe Alexandra three days later. He formed an impressive partnership with Bob Hatton, feeding off the distribution of Colin Morris as United ended the season with 19 games without defeat to win the Fourth Division Championship, his 35 goals being a post-war record. His final appearance for United came in a pre-season friendly at Bramall Lane against Spanish club Sevilla FC on 1 August 1986. He began the 1986‚Äì87 season at Leeds United after a transfer fee of ¬£125,000 but only managed 9 goals in 51 appearances, although one of those was against Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1987. Despite his efforts, Leeds lost the game 3‚Äì2. They also missed out on promotion to the First Division weeks later, losing the relegation/promotion playoff final to Charlton Athletic in a replay. Aberdeen secured his services later in 1987 and he returned to Hull City in 1988. He later played for Stockport County, Huddersfield Town and finished his career at Plymouth Argyle in 1990. He is one of the select band of players to have scored over 250 league goals in English football, although almost all of his career was spent outside the top flight. In recent years, Keith has worked for BBC Radio Sheffield commentating on matches involving one of his former clubs, Sheffield United.

For a long time, the most esteemed calligrapher in Japan had been Wang Xizhi, a Chinese calligrapher from the 4th century, but after the invention of Hiragana and Katakana, the Japanese unique syllabaries, the distinctive Japanese writing system developed and calligraphers produced styles intrinsic to Japan. The term shod≈ç (Êõ∏ÈÅì, \\"way of writing\\") is of Chinese origin as it is widely used to describe the art of Chinese calligraphy during the medieval Tang dynasty.  Styles  Early Japanese calligraphy was originated from Chinese calligraphy. Many of its principles and techniques are very similar, and it recognizes the same basic writing styles: * seal script (ÁØÜÊõ∏ tensho) (pinyin: zhu√†nsh≈´). The Seal Script (tensho) was commonly used throughout the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BC) and the following Qin Dynasty (221- 206 BC) of China. After this time period, tens style fell out of popularity in favor of reishi. However, tensho was still used for titles of published works or inscriptions. The clear and bold style of tensho made it work well for titles and this tradition of using tensho only for titles is still around today. By the time Chinese characters and calligraphy migrated over to Japan, tensho was already only used for titles and as a result, was never commonly used in Japan. In 57 AD, the Chinese emperor, Guang Wu presented a golden seal to a king of a small region near what is now known as Fukuoka Prefecture. While this seal was not made in Japan, it is believed to be the first instance of tensho in Japan. The first work in Japan that actually utilized tensho was during the Nara period (646-794) was a six-paneled screen called the Torige Tensho Byobu. Each panel is divided into two columns and each column has eight characters. The screen speaks to a ruler and recommends that he use the counsel of wise ministers in order to rule justly. * clerical script (Èö∑Êõ∏ reisho) (pinyin: l√¨sh≈´) The Clerical Script or Scribe's Script (reisho) is a very bold and commanding style of Chinese calligraphy, each of the strokes are greatly exaggerated at the beginning and end. It was most commonly used during the Han Dynasty (206 BC- 220 AD) and the term reisho had many significant meanings but is now only known as one of the five styles of Chinese and Japanese calligraphy. Because of its bold style, the reisho technique is now reserved for large text applications such as plaques, signboards, titles of works, etc. This was its main purpose in Japan as well until the Edo Period (1603-1868) when it was regarded as a calligraphic art form. * regular script (Ê•∑Êõ∏ kaisho) (pinyin: k«éish≈´) The Regular Script or Block Script (kaisho) is fairly similar in function to that of Roman block capitals. While Japanese kaisho varies slightly from Chinese kaisho, it is primarily based on Chinese kaisho script in both form and function. The Japanese kaisho style was heavily influenced by the Sui Dynasty (581-618) and the following Tang Dynasty (618-907). Early examples of this style in Japan are mostly various statue and temple inscriptions. This was during the early Heian Period (794-1185) and as time progressed there was a movement in Japan to become more culturally independent and a version of kaisho developed that became uniquely Japanese and included a little bit of the gyosho style. As its influence spread, the primary use of the kaisho technique was to copy the Lotus Sutra. There was a second wave of influence during the Kamakura (1192-1333) and Muromachi (1338-1573) periods, but this was mostly by Zen monks who used a technique based on Zen insight and is different from the classic kaisho technique. * semi-cursive (Ë°åÊõ∏ gy≈çsho) (pinyin: x√≠ngsh≈´) The Semi-cursive Script (gyosho) means exactly what it says; this script style is a slightly more cursive version of kaisho script. This script was practiced at the same time as the reisho script. There are three different levels of \\"cursiveness\\" called seigyo, gyo, and gyoso. The style of gyosho utilizes a softer and more rounded technique, staying away from sharp corners and angles. In Japan many works were made using the gyosho technique during the early Heian Period. Later in the Heian Period, once Japan began to separate itself from China a Japanese version called wayo began to emerge. The Japanese version of gyosho became widely popular and became the basis of many schools of calligraphy. This was a result of gyosho meshing very well with both kanji and hiragana and writing with this technique was both natural and fluid. * cursive (ËçâÊõ∏ s≈çsho) (pinyin: c«éosh≈´). The Cursive Script (sosho) has its origins in the Han Dynasty. It was used by scribes as a cursive version of reisho for taking notes. Early examples of sosho include inscriptions on bamboo and other wooden strips. This technique can be easily recognized by many strokes ending with a sweep to the upper right in a breaking-wave type form. As the Han Dynasty came to an end, another version of sosho was developed, but this version was written slowly as opposed to the faster sosho that was popular until then. The exact date when sosho was introduced is unclear. Several texts from Japan shared many sosho-like techniques with Chinese texts during this time but it was not until Kukai, a famous Japanese buddhist monk and scholar traveled to China during the early Heian Period and brought back copies of texts that he made written in the sosho style.  Tools  A traditional inkstone to grind ink and water against. A typical brush used for calligraphy. A number of tools are used to create a work of modern calligraphy.Yuuko Suzuki, Introduction to japanese calligraphy, Search Press, 2005 * The four most basic tools were collectively called the . ** A ** An .The hardened mixture of vegetable or pine soot and glue in the shape of a stick. The best inksticks are between 50 and 100 years old. ** An to grind the inkstick against, mixed with water. * Other tools include: ** A to hold the paper in place ** A to place under the paper (often newsprint is used as well) to prevent ink from bleeding through. ** A . The art of engraving a seal is called \\"tenkoku\\" ÁØÜÂàª. The student is encouraged to engrave his own seal. The position of the seal or seals is based on aesthetic preferences. One is not allowed to put a seal on calligraphy of a sutra. During preparation, water is poured into the inkstone and the inkstick is ground against it, mixing the water with the dried ink to liquefy it. As this is a time-consuming process, modern-day beginners frequently use bottled liquid ink called . More advanced students are encouraged to grind their own ink. Paper is usually placed on a desk, while a large piece of paper may be placed on the floor or even on the ground (for a performance). The brushes come in various shapes and sizes, and are usually made using animal hair bristles. Typical animal hair may come from goats, sheep, or horses. The handle may be made from wood, bamboo, plastic or other materials.  History   Chinese roots  Medicine Buddha, H≈çry≈´-ji Temple Written in the 7th century The Chinese roots of Japanese calligraphy go back to the twenty-eighth century BC, to a time when pictographs were inscribed on bone for religious purposes. When this writing developed into an instrument of administration for the state, the need for a uniform script was felt and Li Si, prime minister in the Chinese dynasty of Qin, standardized a script and its way of being written. He sanctioned a form of script based on squares of uniform size into which all characters could be written from eight strokes. He also devised rules of composition where horizontal strokes are written first and characters are composed starting from top to bottom, left to right. Because the symbols were inscribed with sharp instruments, the lines were originally angular and in many ways, Li Si's achievements were made obsolete by the appearance of brush and ink (see Chinese calligraphy). The ink-wet brush creates a line quite different from a sharp stylus. It affords variation in thickness and curve of line. Calligraphy retained the block form of Li Si and his eight strokes but the writer was free to create characters that emphasized aesthetically pleasing balance and form. The way a character was written gave a message of style. Calligraphy in the Chinese tradition was thus introduced to Japan about AD 600 Known as the karay≈ç tradition, it has been practiced up to today, rejuvenated continuously through contact with Chinese culture.Nakata 1973, p. 145 ff. The oldest existing calligraphic text in Japan is the inscription on the halo of the Medicine Buddha statue in the H≈çry≈´-ji Temple. This Chinese text was written in Shaky≈çtai () style, prominent in the Chinese Six Dynasties period.  Before the Nara period  Gakki-ron, written by the Empress K≈çmy≈ç in 744. She copied this text from Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi's and today this is regarded as one of the most important copies of Wang Xizhi's calligraphy. (see also: :File:Gakkiron 2.jpg) The H≈çry≈´-ji Temple also holds bibliographic notes on the Lotus Sutra: the was written early in the 7th century and is considered the oldest Japanese text. It is written in Cursive script and illustrates that calligraphy in the Asuka period was already refined to a high degree. The oldest hand-copied sutra in Japan is the Kong≈ç J≈çdaraniky≈ç. Copied by the priest H≈çrin in AD 686, the calligraphy style shows influences from the work of Ouyang Xun. (mid-7th century) and Stone in Nasu County are also typical examples from this time. Both inscriptions were influenced by the Northern Wei robust style. In the 7th century, the Tang dynasty established hegemony in China. Their second Emperor Taizong esteemed Wang Xizhi's calligraphic texts and this popularity influenced Japanese calligraphers. All of the original texts written by Wang Xizhi have been lost, and copies such as Gakki-ron written by the Empress K≈çmy≈ç are highly regarded as important sources for Wang Xizhi's style. However Wang's influence can barely be overstated, in particular for the way≈ç style unique to Japan: \\"Even today, there is something about Japanese calligraphy that retains the unchanged flavour of Wang Xizhi's style\\".Nakata 1973, p. 170  Heian period  Cry for noble Saich≈ç (Âì≠ÊúÄÊæÑ‰∏ä‰∫∫), which was written by Emperor Saga for Saich≈ç's death. Saga was a scholar of the Chinese classics. He was also renowned as a skillful calligrapher. Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Heij≈ç-ky≈ç in Nara, first to Nagaoka-ky≈ç in 784, and then to Heian-ky≈ç, Kyoto in 794. This marks the beginning of the Heian era, Japan's \\"golden age\\". Chinese influences in calligraphy were not changed in the early period. For example, under the Emperor Saga's reign, royalty, the aristocracy and even court ladies studied calligraphy by copying Chinese poetry texts in artistic style. Wang Xizhi's influences remained dominant, which are shown in calligraphies written by K≈´kai or Saich≈ç. Some other Chinese calligraphers, such as Ouyang Xun and Yan Zhenqing were also highly valued. Their most notable admirers were Emperor Saga and Tachibana no Hayanari respectively. At the same time, a style of calligraphy unique to Japan emerged. Writing had been popularized, and the kana syllabary was devised to deal with elements of pronunciation that could not be written with the borrowed Chinese characters. Japanese calligraphers still fitted the basic characters, called kanji , into the squares laid out centuries before. A fragment, Kara-ai no hana no utagire (ÈüìËóçËä±Ê≠åÂàá, AD 749) is considered the first text to show a style unique to Japanese calligraphy; it shows a Tanka poem using Man'y≈çgana, thus deviated from contemporary Chinese calligraphy. Ono no Michikaze (AD 894-966), one of the so-called sanseki , \\"Three Brush Traces\\"), along with Fujiwara no Sukemasa and Fujiwara no Yukinari, is considered the founder of the authentically Japanese way≈ç style, or way≈ç-shod≈ç . This development resonated with the court: K≈´kai said to Emperor Saga, \\"China is a large country and Japan is relatively small, so I suggest writing in a different way.\\" The , a poem written by Emperor Saga on the occasion of Saich≈ç's death, was one of the examples of such a transformation. Ono no Michikaze served as an archetype for the Sh≈çren-in school, which later became the Oie style of calligraphy. The Oie style was later used for official documents in the Edo period and was the prevailing style taught in the terakoya schools of that time.  Kamakura and Muromachi period  Fujiwara no Teika's hand of \\"Superior Poems of our Time\\", showing his calligraphic style. The ascension of Minamoto no Yoritomo to the title of sh≈çgun, following the H≈çgen and Heiji rebellions, and the victory of the Minamoto clan over the Taira, marked the beginning of the Kamakura period (AD 1185‚Äì1333), but not quite yet to a return to peace and tranquility. The era is sometimes called \\"the age of the warriors\\" and a broad transition from court influences to a leading role of the military establishment pervaded the culture. It is also, however, a time when exchanges with China of the Song dynasty continued and Buddhism greatly flourished. Zen monks such as Shunjo studied in China and the copybooks that he brought with him are considered highly influential for the karay≈ç tradition of the time, expressing a clear kaisho style.Nakata 1973, p. 153 But this was not the only example, indeed a succession of Chinese monks were naturalized at that time, encouraged by regent H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori. Rankei Dory≈´ founded the Kench≈ç-ji temple in Kamakura and many of his works have been preserved. However, with the rise of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism a less technical style appeared, representative of Zen attitudes and exemplified in the works of Mus≈ç Soseki who wrote in a refined sosho style, or Sh≈´h≈ç My≈çcho (1282‚Äì1337; better known as Daito Kokushi), the founder of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto, who had not traveled to China to study. In terms of way≈ç style, the works of Fujiwara no Shunzei and Fujiwara no Teika are considered outstanding examples of the late Heian and early Kamakura.Nakata 1973, p. 166 Political and military unrest continued throughout the Muromachi period (AD 1336‚Äì1537), characterized by tensions between imperial and civil authority and periods of outright civil war. However, as Ashikaga Takauji had ousted Emperor Go-Daigo from Kyoto to establish his own bakufu there, the intermingling of residual members of the imperial court, courtiers, daimy≈çs, samurai, and Zen priests resulted in vibrant cultural impulses. The arts prospered, but are not considered as refined as that of earlier times. Of note is the role of Ikky≈´ S≈çjun, a successor of Sh≈´h≈ç My≈çcho at Daitoku-ji; Ikky≈´ was instrumental in elevating the appreciation of calligraphy to an integral part of the tea ceremony in the 15th century.Nakata 1973, p. 156  Edo period  Hon'ami K≈çetsu. Tokugawa Ieyasu centralized power in his shogunate between 1603 and 1615. This marked the beginning of the Edo period, which brought 250 years of relative stability to Japan, lasting until the second half of the 19th century. The period was marked by seclusion from overseas influences with the policy. Calligraphic studies were essentially limited to the study of karay≈ç style works, via Ming- dynasty China. Indigenous developments were contributed by Ingen and the ≈åbaku sect of Zen buddhism, and the Daishi school of calligraphy. The latter focused on the study of the , which go back to Wang Xizhi, and the 72 types of hissei (\\"brush energy\\") expounded by Wang Xizhi's teacher, the Lady Wei. The 1664 reprint of a copybook based on these principles in Kyoto contributed an important theoretical development.Nakata 1973, p. 157 Calligraphers such as Hosoi Kotaku, who authored the five-volume Kanga Hyakudan in 1735, further advanced the karay≈ç style. Very characteristic for the early Edo period was an innovation by Hon'ami K≈çetsu (1558‚Äì1637) who had paper made to order and painted a backdrop of decorative patterns, butterflies or floral elements that his calligraphy established a poetic correspondence with. Together with Konoe Nobutada (1565‚Äì1614) and Sh≈çkad≈ç Sh≈çj≈ç (1584‚Äì1639) ‚Äì the three Kan'ei Sanpitsu ‚Äì he is considered one of the greatest calligraphers in the way≈ç style at the time, creating examples of \\"a uniquely Japanese calligraphy\\".Nakata 1973, p.168 Around 1736 Yoshimune began relaxing Japan's isolation policy and Chinese cultural imports increased, in particular via the port of Nagasaki. Catalogues of imported copybooks testify to a broad appreciation of Chinese calligraphers among the Japanese literati who pursued the karay≈ç style: \\"traditionalists\\" studied Wang Xizhi and Wen Zhengming, while \\"reformists\\" modeled their work on the s≈çsho style of calligraphers such as Zhang Xu, Huaisu and Mi Fu. In terms of way≈ç, Konoe Iehiro contributed many fine kana works but generally speaking, way≈ç style was not as vigorously practised as karay≈ç at that time.Nakata 1973, p.169 Nevertheless, some examples have been preserved by scholars of , or poets and painters such as Kaga no Chiyo, Yosa Buson or Sakai H≈çitsu. Today In contemporary Japan, shodo is a popular class for elementary school and junior high school students. Many parents believe that having their children focus and sit still while practicing calligraphy will be beneficial. In high school, calligraphy is one of the choices among art subjects, along with music or painting. It is also a popular high school club activity, particularly with the advent of performance calligraphy. Some universities, such as University of Tsukuba, Tokyo Gakugei University and Fukuoka University of Education, have special departments of calligraphic study that emphasize teacher-training programs in calligraphy. Connection to Zen Buddhism Calligraphy by Mus≈ç Soseki (1275‚Äì1351, Japanese zen master, poet, and calligrapher. The characters \\"Âà•ÁÑ°Â∑•Â§´\\" (\\"no spiritual meaning\\") are written in a flowing, connected s≈çsho style. Japanese calligraphy was influenced by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any particular piece of paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the brush. The brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence shows up in the work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at a moment in time (see Hitsuzend≈ç, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ens≈ç or circle of enlightenment. Zen calligraphy is practiced by Buddhist monks and most shod≈ç practitioners. To write Zen calligraphy with mastery, one must clear one's mind and let the letters flow out of themselves, not practice and make a tremendous effort. This state of mind was called the by the Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitaro. It is based on the principles of Zen Buddhism, which stresses a connection to the spiritual rather than the physical. Before Japanese tea ceremonies (which are connected to Zen Buddhism), one is to look at a work of shod≈ç to clear one's mind. This is considered an essential step in the preparation for a tea ceremony.

Peter McCardle (born 28 September 1955), is a New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1990 to 1999, first as a member of the National Party, then as a member of New Zealand First, and finally as an independent. McCardle was deputy mayor of Upper Hutt from 2007 to 2013. Pre- parliamentary career McCardle originally worked for the New Zealand Employment Service, and was prompted to enter politics by a desire to make a significant contribution to unemployment and welfare policy. Member of Parliament McCardle was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 election as the National MP for the Heretaunga electorate, defeating the Labour MP Bill Jeffries. McCardle was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating Labour Party candidate Heather Simpson (now Helen Clark's Chief of Staff). McCardle, however, found his party colleagues unwilling to adopt his radical employment policies, which were primarily based around the idea of \\"workfare\\". In 1996, after being involved in failed discussions with Mike Moore to form a new party, McCardle eventually decided to leave National and join New Zealand First, where he hoped to have greater influence. McCardle was re-elected to Parliament as a New Zealand First list MP in the 1996 election, also unsuccessfully contesting the Rimutaka seat. In the coalition government formed by National and New Zealand First, McCardle became Minister of Employment, and set about implementing some of his proposals. When the coalition began to collapse, McCardle joined the group that broke from New Zealand First to continue supporting the government. He did not retain his Employment portfolio, but was given other ministerial roles. He remained an independent for the duration of the parliamentary term, but did not choose to seek re-election. Post-parliamentary career Soon after the 1999 election Dr. Muriel Newman, the ACT Welfare Spokesman, hired McCardle as a consultant. McCardle eventually was offered the role as head of the ACT Parliamentary Research Unit. In the 2001 local body elections and district health board elections McCardle was elected as an Upper Hutt City councillor and Hutt Valley District Health Board member, both roles he successfully defended in the 2004 and 2007 elections. He was re-elected to the Upper Hutt council in 2010 but stood down at the 2013 election to campaign against local-body amalgamation in the Wellington region. He served as deputy mayor from 2007 to 2013. McCardle left his ACT Parliamentary Office role before the 2005 election to write his memoirs. McCardle resigned from the Hutt Valley District Health Board in 2008, when he became senior advisor to the new National Party Minister of Health, Tony Ryall. McCardle and Ryall entered Parliament together in 1990.

Based on Michael Crichton's 1999 novel of the same name, the screenplay concerns a team of present-day archaeology and history students who are sent back in time to medieval France, to rescue their professor from the middle of a battle. Jerry Goldsmith composed the original score, which would have been his last before his death in 2004 (his actual last score was Looney Tunes: Back in Action), but it was replaced with a new score by Brian Tyler, after the first cut was re-edited and Goldsmith's increasing health problems prevented him from continuing. The film was poorly received by critics and bombed at the box office, losing an estimated $49 million. Plot Professor Edward Johnston leads an archaeological study of the village of Castlegard, near LaRoque Castle in Dordogne, France, the site of the 1357 hanging of Lady Claire, sister to Arnaut de Cervole. Her martyrdom led France to win the Hundred Years War against the English. Johnston's team includes Scottish archaeologist Andr√© Marek; Johnston's students Kate Erickson, Josh Stern, and Fran√ßois Dontelle; and his son Chris who is infatuated with Kate. While excavating a nearby monastery, they find a sarcophagus containing the remains of a French knight with a lopped ear, holding the hand of his lady, an unheard-of practice for the time. Johnston travels to the American headquarters of the ITC Corporation, his project's sponsor, to inquire whether or not they have tampered with the site. The students later discover a pair of Johnston's bifocals and a note begging for help, although both date over 600 years old. When the students contact ITC, the company invites them to its headquarters. There, the team is introduced to ITC president Robert Doniger and vice- president Steven Kramer. Doniger reveals that in the process of developing teleportation technology, they locked onto a stable wormhole to 1357 Castlegard. Johnston was invited to see the past for himself, but his group has not returned, and they want the students to go back in time to locate him. All but Josh volunteer to go. The volunteers are stripped of all modern technology save for pendant-shaped markers they can use to initiate their return. The students are joined by a security team including ITC's head of security Frank Gordon and two former military men. On arrival in 1357, the team finds itself in the path of a young woman chased by English knights; the security men are killed while protecting the group, although one activated his marker shortly after priming a grenade. When his body arrives in the present, the grenade detonates and shatters much of the teleportation device. Josh aids Kramer in making repairs. The team evades the knights, and the woman leads them to the English-controlled Castlegard. They are captured and brought before Lord Oliver de Vannes and his second in command, DeKere. The team members are stripped of their markers, and de Vannes kills Fran√ßois, believing he is a French spy. The others are imprisoned along with Johnston, who is revealed to have promised de Vannes that he can make Greek fire for the English in exchange for his life. They make their escape but are pursued by the English. Gordon and Johnston are recaptured, while the others make for the monastery, led by the woman. DeKere reveals himself to Gordon and Johnston as former ITC employee William Decker; he had frequently used the teleportation device but was not told by ITC that each use damaged his DNA until it was too late, at which point he would die on a return trip. He plans revenge on ITC and kills Gordon. De Vannes orders his knights to march on LaRoque castle, and DeKere brings Johnston along. At the monastery, Marek, Kate, and Chris meet de Cervole and realize the woman is Lady Claire; they have changed history by saving her. Marek, who has become infatuated with Lady Claire, is given a horse to rescue his friends. Kate and Chris help to swing the upcoming battle in the French's favor by leading de Cervole's men through the monastery tunnels they had previously mapped to the castle. As the battle starts, Marek is captured in his rescue attempt; Lady Claire is also kidnapped. Marek manages to free himself, Lady Claire, and Johnston, while Chris helps de Cervole defeat de Vannes. Enraged, DeKere slashes off Marek's earlobe, and Marek realizes he is destined to be the knight in the sarcophagus. Marek defeats DeKere, recovers the markers, gives them to the others, and says his goodbyes as he runs off to help the French assure victory and restore history. As the three returnees activate their markers, in the present Josh and Kramer have finished the repairs after coming to learn that Doniger has attempted to sabotage their attempts; Doniger fears that when the students' stories become public, ITC will suffer great financial losses. As the machine activates, Doniger races into it, attempting to block the teleportation, but instead he is sent back to 1357, where he arrives outside the castle and is presumably killed by a charging knight. Chris, Kate, and Johnston safely return. Later, the team returns to the Castlegard ruins, re-examine the sarcophagus, and find that Marek and Lady Claire led a prosperous life after the war and had three children: Christophe, Katherine, and Fran√ßois.

Richard Donner limited the use of CGI in the film as much as possible. Composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had previously collaborated with Donner on The Omen, completed a score for the film - his final score before his death in 2004 - but it was replaced by a different score composed by Brian Tyler after Donner was forced to re-cut the film at the insistence of Sherry Lansing, the then-head of Paramount Pictures. However, both Goldsmith and Tyler's scores were released on CD. Reception Timeline performed poorly at the box office, only recouping $43 million worldwide from a budget of $80 million. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 11% based on reviews from 142 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"This incoherently plotted addition to the time-travel genre looks and sounds cheesy\\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 285 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F.

It was developed by Eutechnyx, published by Electronic Arts, and released in 2000 for the PlayStation console system. This game marks the seventh appearance of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond; the game included his likeness but not his voice, which is provided by Tim Bentinck. Including many revived characters from previous entries, the game is considered to be a spin-off out of the original chronicles. Gameplay In 007 Racing the player takes on the role of British secret agent Commander James Bond behind the wheel of some of his most famous vehicles from the then-current 19 official films. Cars include the Aston Martin DB5 made famous in its initial appearance in Goldfinger, the Lotus Esprit from The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only, and the BMW Z8 that briefly appeared in The World is not Enough as well as seven other automobiles. Each car is equipped with all the usual gadgetry and weapons issued by Q, the Quartermaster of a special branch of MI6 referred to as Q-Branch. Plot In 007 Racing, a high ranking European diplomat and businessman plans to hijack a shipment of NATO weapons and smuggle them to international terrorists inside cars that roll off the assembly line of his automotive plants. As Bond, it is up to the player to stop him. The gamer is supplied with some of the most famous gadget-filled cars from the Bond universe to thwart the evil villain. The story opens with Bond rescuing Cherise Litte from an Eastern European country (presumably Estonia) and getting her over the border in his Aston Martin DB5. Upon his return to London he is informed by M that a freighter carrying top secret NATO weapons including laser-guided surface-to-air missiles, long-range missiles, missile shields, latest GPS technology and Q equipped BMW 750iL bound for Halifax was intercepted in the Labrador Sea, south of Greenland. Bond is tasked with finding the cargo. His mission takes him to New York City, where he is met by his friend from the CIA Jack Wade. Upon arriving in New York he is informed by a villain that a bomb has been planted on his car and that any attempt to defuse it or slow down the vehicle will cause it to explode. Bond jettisons the car in the Hudson River. Bond continues on with finding the electromagnetic pulse device that was stolen and destroying ten computers in distribution center from which a car transporter carrying the smuggling cars. He intercepts the transporter with his Aston Martin. Bond then goes to Mexico with his BMW Z3, to where he was pointed by questioning the transporter driver, the henchman Whisper. He is trying to track Zukovsky and once he manages, he finds out that behind everything is Dr Hammond Litte, Cherise's father, and that her rescue was just a decoy mission aiming to distract him from the freighter. Bond then engages in race with Xenia Onatopp and her Ferrari F355 after which he gets captured and taken to Louisiana. He manages to escape and finds the stolen BMW, after which he pursues and destroys the boat driven by Jaws. Back in New York, Bond downloads the files from four limousines with his BMW Z8 and discovers that Litte's real plan is to release a deadly virus that will kill millions. Bond then goes to the Baltic Sea with his Lotus Esprit and after infiltrating opponent's underwater base he destroys the plane transporting the virus. Reception 007 Racing received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Game Informer's Paul Anderson scored the game a 7 out of 10. He called the graphics \\"ugly\\" and \\"nasty\\", but said there are some \\"well-designed\\" missions. He called the voice acting \\"excellent\\", particularly praising the performance given by John Cleese, but thought the game had an inconsistent mix of content. Doug Perry of IGN stated that 007 Racing is \\"a decent little game, as long as you don't expect too much from it\\". He added: \\"It's not original, nor is it good looking. It's filled with awkward spots and questionable areas (like when I reached the broken bridge in Escape and the vocals chimed in after it was too late to launch my parachute), and it becomes a chore rather than fun. Occasionally, there are little flashes of goodness (Escape and Gimme a Break are examples), but the game never really reaches any new planes of play that we've did already experience in Spy Hunter, back in the early 1980s. I mean if you're simply dying to drive Bond cars, rent this game, but don't buy it full price. Now, if you don't mind, I've got an old-school arcade to find.\\" Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot gave a mixed review, with a score of 5.3 out of 10. He stated: \\"The game's varied mission objectives occasionally give it a Driver- like feel, but the clunky control issues really manage to take you out of the game. The heavily modified Need for Speed engine is great for the fast action, fast driving missions, but the slower-paced, more combat-heavy levels suffer from the game's rough control. Overall, 007 Racing isn't polished enough to fill the needs of objective-based driving game fans. Fans of these types of games would be better served by Driver 2.\\" Retro Gamer criticized the slow pace of the missions. David Chen of Next Generation said that the game was \\"fine as a rental car, but not worth the sticker price.\\" See also *Outline of James Bond References External links * Category:2000 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:MGM Interactive games Category:Eutechnyx games Category:James Bond video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Video games set in Louisiana Category:Video games set in Mexico Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games ","title":"007 Racing"},{"id":"1119797","text":"A Jewish quota was a discriminatory racial quota designed to limit or deny access for Jews to various institutions. Such quotas were widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries in developed countries and frequently present in higher education, often at prestigious universities. By countries Canada Certain universities, notably McGill University, Universit√© de Montr√©al and the University of Toronto, had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. McGill University's strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.Gerald Tulchinsky, Canada's Jews: A People's Journey, (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 2008, p. 132-133, 319-321.Tulchinsky, Canada's Jews, p. 133.Tulchinsky, Canada's Jews, p. 410.

Page 4. On 25 April 1933, the Nazi government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German Non- Aryans‚Äîi.e. essentially of German Jews‚Äîas core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high- schools (h√∂here Schulen) and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5 per cent of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities,Gesetz gegen die √úberf√ºllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225) (original German text of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities, introduced in 1933) Erste Verordnung zur Durchf√ºhrung des Gesetzes gegen die √úberf√ºllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 226) (original German text of the First Regulation for the Implementation of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities, introduced in 1933) which referred to German concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76 percent of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6 percent of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9 percent in the 1880s.Claudia Huerkamp (1993).

(German)p. 193 Apart from their strong and predominant anti-Semitic agenda, the law and its subsequent regulations were temporarily indeed used to limit general university access, i.e. including \\"non-Aryans\\" (Jews), as the name of the law implied. Starting 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women's admissions to a maximum of 10 percent. Although the limits were not entirely enforced‚Äîwomen's quota stayed a bit above 10 percent mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions‚Äîthey made it for women approximately twice as hard to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.Claudia Huerkamp (1996). Bildungsb√ºrgerinnen. Frauen im Studium und in akademischen Berufen 1900-1945. (Reihe: B√ºrgertum, Band 10) S. 80ff. After two semesters, the admission limits were revoked, however, leaving in place the non-Aryan regulations.p. 178 :For additional information in German, see the article at the German Wikipedia Hungary Numerus Clausus Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of P√°l Teleki. It was said that the ethnic rate of students must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.See: Numerus Clausus Latvia Jewish quotas were introduced in 1934, under KƒÅrlis Ulmanis' authoritarian regime. Poland See Numerus clausus in Poland and Ghetto benches. Romania Numerus Clausus was not introduced by law, but it was adopted by students in the universities Cluj, Bucharest, Iasi and Cernauti. Russia Discrimination against Jews in Russia has existed for centuries, including during Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Numerus Clausus was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where Jews were allowed to live, 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in Moscow and St. Petersburg. These limitations were removed in the spring of 1917 after the tsar's abdication during the early phase of the Russian revolution of 1917-1918 (the so-called February Revolution of 1917); later, in the late 1940s during the initial phase of the Cold War and the tide of the anti-\\"rootless cosmopolitan\\" campaign a de facto gross discrimination of Jewish applicants was reintroduced in many institutions of higher education in the Soviet Union until Perestroika. United States Certain private universities, most notably Harvard, introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. According to historian David Oshinsky, on writing about Jonas Salk, \\"Most of the surrounding medical schools (Cornell, Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in.\\" He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions were remarkably precise: \\"Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all.\\" As a result, Oshinsky added, \\"Jonas Salk and hundreds like him\\" enrolled in New York University instead.Oshinsky, David M.

Jindae law is a grain loan system enacted by Gogukcheon in 194. This system allowed people to borrow grain from March to July and pay back in October. This system was maintained by the age of Joseon dynasty as \\"Hwangok\\", which indicates the law was highly preserved more than a thousand years.  Death and Succession  Though Gogukcheon ascension signaled a change from fraternal succession to father-son succession by primogeniture, he was succeeded by his brother Sansang.

Her name and title at birth was Ljubica Petroviƒá- Njego≈°, Princess of Montenegro. In 1883, she married prince Peter Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá and she changed her name to Zorka (and her surname to Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá). She died in childbirth while giving birth to Prince Andrija on 16 March 1890.

Campolo is known as one of the most influential leaders in the evangelical left and has been a major proponent of progressive thought and reform within the evangelical community. He has also become a leader of the Red-Letter Christian movement, which aims to put emphasis on the teachings of Jesus. Campolo is a popular commentator on religious, political, and social issues, and has been a guest on programs such as The Colbert Report, The Charlie Rose Show, Larry King Live, Nightline, Crossfire, Politically Incorrect and The Hour. Biography Campolo graduate of Eastern College in 1956, Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary (now Palmer Theological Seminary) and earned a PhD from Temple University. Noel de Bien, Feature Interview: Tony Campolo, abc.net.au, Australia, June 27, 2004 He was ordained Baptist minister and evangelist. Ministry He was a professor emeritus of sociology at Eastern University in St. David's, Pennsylvania. He became an associate pastor of the Mount Carmel Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, which is affiliated with both the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and the American Baptist Churches USA.MTCarmel-bc.org He commuted often to the church from his home in St. Davids, Pennsylvania. For ten years, he was a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. Campolo founded the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education (EAPE), which works to help \\"at-risk\\" youth in the U.S. and Canada, and has helped to establish several schools and universities. His best known work is a sermon entitled It's Friday, But Sunday's Coming!, recordings of which have been widely circulated in evangelical circles, and which is based on a sermon by a black minister at Mount Carmel Baptist Church. He is a frequent speaker at Christian conferences. He was also one of several spiritual advisers to President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal where he met with president Clinton at the White House. Although he has associated himself with the Democratic Party and several other modern liberal groups and causes, he has publicly stated his opposition to abortion. Campolo holds a consistent life ethic stance in opposition to any human situation that leads to the termination of life including warfare, poverty/starvation (as caused by extreme wealth inequalities), capital punishment, and euthanasia. (revised May 25, 2011) Starting in the late 1980s, his left-leaning political beliefs began to put leaders of the Christian right, such as Gary Bauer and Jerry Falwell, at odds with Campolo. Despite his criticisms of the politically conservative evangelical community, Campolo has also criticized the more liberal mainline Christian denominations because \\"they fail to emphasize a personal, transforming relationship with Jesus Christ.\\" Campolo was the subject of an informal heresy hearing in 1985 brought about by several assertions in his 1983 book A Reasonable Faith, particularly his claim that, \\"Jesus is actually present in each other person\\". The book became a hot button issue, and the controversy caused Campus Crusade for Christ and Youth for Christ to block a planned speaking engagement by Campolo. The Christian Legal Society empowered a \\"reconciliation panel\\", led by noted theologian J. I. Packer, to examine the issue and resolve the controversy. The panel examined the book and questioned Campolo. The panel issued a statement saying that although it found Campolo's statements \\"methodologically na√Øve and verbally incautious\\", it did not find them to be heretical. On January 14, 2014, Campolo announced his plans to retire from leading the EAPE and to close that ministry. The extra money in the ministry will be distributed to offshoot ministries started by EAPE; however, he plans to continue writing and speaking.  TV show  Beginning in March 2011, Tony began hosting the TV show Red Letter Christians, aired on JC- TV. This weekly half-hour talk show features interviews with leaders in the Red-Letter Christian movement.  LGBT sexuality debates  Along with his wife Peggy Campolo, he has participated in very public debates and discussions about the place of lesbians and gays within church and society. Campolo formerly contended that homosexuality was a sin in practice, although not in orientation, while his wife disagreed, holding that committed, monogamous homosexual practice was not a sin; she supports full equality for LGBT people. Regarding marriage, he states that all couples should have the right to a civil union with all the legal rights that are associated with such a contract. > I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying > people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions. The government > should do this for both gay couples and straight couples and, leave marriage > in the hands of the Church and other religious entities.Red Letter > Christians by Tony Campolo, Chapter 7 Gay Rights On June 8, 2015, Campolo released a statement changing his position on the issue of gay relationships, and stating that he now supported full acceptance of Christian gay couples into the Church. He cited several reasons including the institution of marriage primarily being about spiritual growth instead of procreation, what he had learned through his friendships with gay Christian couples, and past examples of exclusionary church traditions practiced \\"by sincere believers, but most of us now agree that they were wrong.\\"  Family  Campolo's son is Bart Campolo, a former evangelical preacher who left Christianity and transitioned to secular humanism. The two have engaged in an ongoing conversation since Bart announced to him that he no longer believes in God. They have co-authored a book exploring the issues at the heart of this conversation, and a documentary film (Leaving My Father's Faith) was released in 2018 which features the conversations between them and tell the story of Bart's journey out of faith.

A conservative Puritan, he served for many years as one of the colony's councilors and magistrates, generally leading opposition to attempts by the English kings to assert control over the colony. He accumulated land in the central part of the colony that eventually became a portion of Framingham, Massachusetts. His government roles included administration of territory in present-day Maine that was purchased by the colony. Danforth was a magistrate and leading figure in the colony at the time of the Salem witch trials, but did not sit on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Despite this, he is inaccurately depicted in Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible and its movie adaptations as doing so. He is presented as a harsh and domineering governor, apparently conflated with William Stoughton, who does not appear in Miller's play (although he and Samuel Sewall are mentioned briefly by Danforth in Act 3, Scene 1). In reality, Danforth is recorded as being critical of the conduct of the trials, and played a role in bringing them to an end. Early life Thomas Danforth was born in Framlingham, Suffolk, England, and baptized on November 20, 1623.May, p. 18 He was the eldest son of Nicholas Danforth (1589‚Äì1638) and Elizabeth Symmes (1596‚Äì1629).Parr and Swope, p. 30 Danforth immigrated with his father, brothers Samuel and Jonathan, and sisters Anna, Elizabeth, and Lydia to New England in 1634, probably aboard the Griffin.May, p. vii The family, along with the 200 or so other passengers aboard, left England to escape persecution for their Puritan beliefs. William Laud had become archbishop of the Church of England in 1633 and begun a crackdown on Nonconformist religious practices (such as those practiced by the more Calvinist Puritans) that prompted a wave of migration to the New World.Labaree, pp. 17‚Äì19May, pp. x‚Äìxi Public service The original charter of Harvard College Soon after his arrival in the Massachusetts Bay Colony Nicholas Danforth acquired property in Cambridge, becoming one of the town's leading citizens and a member of the colony's general court (as its assembly was known). He died in 1638, leaving his lands and the care of his younger children to Thomas. In 1643 Danforth was admitted a freeman of the colony, which conferred on him the right to vote and to participate in the colony's political affairs. He was appointed Treasurer of Harvard College in its charter of 1650, and served as a steward of the college from 1669 to 1682. From 1659 he sat on the colony's council of assistants, and was elected deputy governor in 1679. In 1665 Danforth was member of a commission that oversaw the extension of Massachusetts colonial authority over the territories of what is now southern Maine,Martin, p. 16 which colonial surveyors had determined to fall within its borders.Mayo, pp. 225‚Äì226 Danforth's politics and religion were relatively conservative, with one historian describing him as \\"the Pym of Massachusetts politics\\".Doyle, p. 134 In 1661 the colony was rebuked by King Charles II for its mistreatment of Quakers; the colonial government had banned Quakers from its territory under threat of death, and four of them had recently been hanged after repeatedly violating the ban. The king in his letter demanded that the colony allow Quakers and others freedom of religious expression.Doyle, pp. 108‚Äì109, 134 Danforth was one member of a committee that was established to formulate a response. The document the committee drafted was a conservative declaration that the colonial government was essentially sovereign except where its laws conflicted with English law. (By the time the king's letter arrived the colonial government had already lessened the harsh punishments for violating bans.)Doyle, pp. 134‚Äì135 Two committee members, magistrate Simon Bradstreet and minister John Norton, were sent to England to argue the colony's case.Doyle, p. 136 When King Philip's War broke out in 1675 (pitting many Native American tribes of southern New England against English colonists), Danforth was involved in some of the events of the war. Many colonists distrusted the Praying Indians (Christianized Indians living peacefully in communities on the outskirts of English towns), some of whom were attacked by mobs of English settlers seeking revenge for attacks on their communities. Danforth, along with Daniel Gookin and the Indian missionary Reverend John Eliot, was a vocal supporter of the Praying Indians, and worked to prevent some of these excesses, at some personal risk.Pulsipher, pp. 147‚Äì149 In one notable instance Danforth was aboard a small boat with other colonial officials in Boston Harbor en route to Long Island to inspect facilities for Praying Indians who had been relocated there \\"for their own safety\\" when a nearby ship apparently intentionally rammed the smaller vessel. No one was injured in the incident, but all of the older officials were dunked in the cold waters of the harbor.Pulsipher, pp. 147, 154‚Äì155 In 1680 Danforth was chosen president in the District of Maine by the Massachusetts assembly. The colony had previously governed this territory (roughly the land between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers in what is now southwestern Maine), but its right to do so had been stripped by King Charles after protests by the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who had long-standing claims to the area. Agents for Massachusetts then purchased the territory from the Gorges heirs, and Danforth was appointed to administer it.York Deeds, p. 9 The territory had been devastated and many properties abandoned during King Philip's War, and Danforth acted in effect as a Lord Proprietor, making land grants and reestablishing towns such as Falmouth and North Yarmouth. Danforth was rewarded by the colony with a grant of an island in Casco Bay for this work, which he oversaw until 1686.Martin, p. 17 Throughout the 1670s the Massachusetts leadership steadfastly refused to make changes to its administration that were demanded by King Charles.Adams (2001), pp. 377‚Äì386 At the instigation of agent Edward Randolph, Charles made increasingly specific demands concerning freedom of religion and adherence to colonial trade regulations known as the Navigation Acts, and prepared to issue a quo warranto writ to demand the return of the colonial charter. Danforth was one of the leading opponents to making any accommodation to the king's demands.Adams (2001), pp. 391‚Äì394 The issue reached a peak in the 1684 election, in which Danforth stood for election as governor representing the hardline party. He was narrowly defeated by the more conciliatory Simon Bradstreet, but retained the post of deputy governor.Doyle, p. 222 The colony's attempts at moderation were in vain--the charter was formally annulled on June 18, 1684.Adams (1886), p. 212 In 1686 King James II established the Dominion of New England as a new colonial entity to govern all of New England. He appointed Massachusetts native Joseph Dudley as its first governor; he was replaced later that year by Sir Edmund Andros. Both Dudley and Andros excluded Danforth from their councils, given his opposition to crown authority. The dominion reign, which did not include an elected assembly, was extremely unpopular in Massachusetts for a variety of reasons. When the Glorious Revolution deposed James, Massachusetts Puritan leaders orchestrated an uprising and arrested Andros, Dudley, and other dominion officials. In the period between the dominion's collapse and the establishment of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692, the old colonial government was temporarily reestablished, and Danforth resumed his offices.Harris, p. 316 Salem trials In 1692, Danforth was acting governor during the early months of the witch hysteria in Salem and his name appears once in the Salem court records as part of a council which observed the proceedings on April 11.Woodward, Records of Salem Witchcraft, Copied from the Original Documents, 1864Salem Records but his involvement ended in May upon the arrival of Sir William Phips, the first royal governor under the new charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.Burr, George Lincoln Danforth was not assigned to the special Court of Oyer and Terminer that Phips established shortly thereafter, and he was opposed to the manner in which magistrate William Stoughton conducted the witch trials, which unconditionally accepted spectral evidence in its proceedings and vigorously presumed the guilt of the accused. In a letter by Thomas Brattle in October 8, 1692, Danforth is described as among a select group of \\"several about the Bay, men for understanding, judgement and piety... that do utterly condemn the said proceedings, and do freely deliver their judgment...\\" Burr, George Lincoln After the Court of Oyer and Terminer stopped sitting, a new Superior Court was created, and, in December 1692, Stoughton was elected by the governor's council to head the court, defeating Danforth by three votes. In early 1693, Danforth sat on Superior Court sessions conducted by Stoughton that continued to hear witchcraft cases, but without accepting spectral evidence. By this time the hysteria was dying down, and the court (sometimes with Danforth leading after Stoughton temporarily removed himself in protest at the ban on spectral evidence and other reforms imposed by Governor Phips. Danforth was sympathetic to the plight of individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston; Salem End Road in Framingham is part of the area where they settled.Parr and Swope, p. 38 Family and property Danforth married Mary Withington in 1644. The couple had 12 children, but half of these died before the age of three. Danforth was survived by only three of the others.May, pp. 19‚Äì23 Danforth died in Cambridge on November 5, 1699. The seal of Framingham, Massachusetts; the words \\"Danforth's Farms\\" are visible near the top of the shield. In 1662 Danforth began to acquire land to the west of Boston by way of land grants by the Great and General Court after general surveys conducted by Edmund Rice at the behest of the Court.p.92 In: Temple, J.H. (1887). History of Framingham, Massachusetts, Early Known as Danforth's Farms 1640-1880. Town of Framingham. 794pp. pdf Originally known as \\"Danforth's Farm\\", he began to refer to the estate as \\"Framingham\\" in the 1670s in honor of his birthplace. Although Danforth continued to reside in Cambridge, he developed these lands, which came to number , by issuing 999 year leases rather than selling parcels.Parr and Swope, p. 39 By the 1690s a number of somewhat discontiguous communities existed on the land, which petitioned the state for incorporation. Objections were made to the earliest petition (of 1692) by Danforth, since it did not include all of his lands, and a number of subsequent petitions were objected to by neighboring communities.Hurd, p. 614 It was not until 1700, after Danforth had died, that the town of Framingham was granted a charter.Parr and Swope, p. 40 The town's seal contains the words \\"Danforth's Farms\\" in commemoration of this heritage. Danforth, Maine is named in his honor. The Danforth Museum of Art, founded in 1975, is located in Framingham. Fictional character in The Crucible In Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, Danforth is depicted as the leading judicial figure overseeing the Salem trials. William Stoughton is not a character in the play, and Miller portrays Danforth as an honest but domineering and selfish judge, under whose authority many are imprisoned and sentenced to hang.Bloom, p. 72Abbotson, p. 119 When John Proctor, an accused, defies his authority at the end of the play by refusing to lie and sign a public confession saying that he is a witch and accusing others, he is mercilessly sentenced to hang.Bloom, p. 60 In an introduction to the play, Miller wrote that he had combined several persons and made other changes to the historical characters for dramatic purposes.

Their 1995 single \\"Mighty K.C.\\" became an alternative rock radio hit about three months after a touring van accident that claimed the lives of founding members Jack Vigliatura IV and Bill White, along with tour manager Tim Bender, while the band was on the cusp of national recognition. The surviving members of the band changed the name to Subrosa in 1996 before disbanding in 2001. History Classic lineup (1992‚Äì1995) The band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Vigliatura, bassist White, guitarist Travis Tooke, and drummer Jay Russell. Explaining their name, the band had said that they were so committed to being in a band, they would play music \\"for squirrels.\\" The group played jangly alternative rock akin to R.E.M., one of their prime influences, with heavier moments alluding to the sound of grunge rock and Nirvana. Drummer Jack Griego eventually replaced Russell. In early 1994, they self-released their first full album, Baypath Rd., followed by the Plymouth EP, which simply re-released five songs directly taken from Baypath Rd. Steven E. Goldman, a prominent Miami attorney, served as the band's manager. After touring and establishing a following, the band signed with Sony/550 Music and recorded the album Example with producer Nick Launay (at the time known for working with Midnight Oil, Talking Heads and Kate Bush), which was set to be released on October 3, 1995. On September 8, 1995, while returning from playing the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City, the band was involved in the auto accident that killed Vigliatura, White, and Bender. Griego and Tooke suffered multiple injuries but survived the crash. The album was released as planned. The single \\"Mighty K.C.\\", about the death of Kurt Cobain, was a minor hit and continued to drive album sales. Post-accident (1995-1996) A few months after the accident, Tooke and Griego regrouped with school friend Andy Lord on bass and Tooke taking over on vocals. In February 1996, the new lineup began by playing a few low-key shows centered around classic For Squirrels songs and a selection of covers under the pseudonym Revlover. Eventually, they resurrected the For Squirrels moniker and began writing and performing new material, favoring a heavier grunge sound. As Subrosa (1996‚Äì2001) By late 1996, the trio was playing under the name Subrosa. In the summer of 1997, they released their only record under this name, Never Bet the Devil Your Head, on Sony Records, to decent reviews but poor sales. Second guitarist Mike Amish was later added, which was followed by a tour supporting popular alternative rock act Creed. Griego eventually parted ways with the group and was replaced in the band's final years by Rusty Valentine. They disbanded in 2001. Later activity Tooke, Lord and Amish have remained active in the Gainesville rock scene. Tooke has performed under several monikers including his most recent music project, Helixglow. He has also released a solo CD and several singles (2012) via Indigo Planet Records. Amish and Lord now play in the band Papercranes.

Intumescent wrap strip is used to seal off where the fiberglass will be consumed by fire. Glass wool is an insulating material made from fibres of glass arranged using a binder into a texture similar to wool. The process traps many small pockets of air between the glass, and these small air pockets result in high thermal insulation properties. Glass wool is produced in rolls or in slabs, with different thermal and mechanical properties. It may also be produced as a material that can be sprayed or applied in place, on the surface to be insulated. The modern method for producing glass wool was invented by Games Slayter while he was working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933.US Patent Number 2133235: Method & Apparatus for Making Glass Wool First Slayter glass wool patent, 1933.  Principles of function  Gases possess poor thermal conduction properties compared to liquids and solids and thus make good insulation material if they can be trapped in materials so that much of the heat that flows through the material is forced to flow through the gas. In order to further augment the effectiveness of a gas (such as air) it may be disrupted into small cells which cannot effectively transfer heat by natural convection. Natural convection involves a larger bulk flow of gas driven by buoyancy and temperature differences, and it does not work well in small gas cells where there is little density difference to drive it, and the high surface area to volume ratios of the small cells retards bulk gas flow inside them by means of viscous drag. In order to accomplish the formation of small gas cells in man- made thermal insulation, glass and polymer materials can be used to trap air in a foam-like structure. The same principle used in glass wool is used in other man-made insulators such as rock wool, Styrofoam, wet suit neoprene foam fabrics, and fabrics such as Gore-Tex and polar fleece. The air-trapping property is also the insulation principle used in nature in down feathers and insulating hair such as natural wool. Manufacturing process Natural sand and recycled glass are mixed and heated to 1,450 ¬∞C, to produce glass. The fiberglass is usually produced by a method similar to making cotton candy, by forcing it through a fine mesh by centripetal force, cooling on contact with the air. Cohesion and mechanical strength are obtained by the presence of a binder that ‚Äúcements‚Äù the fibers together. A drop of binder is placed at each fiber intersection. The fiber mat is then heated to around 200 ¬∞C to polymerize the resin and is calendered to give it strength and stability. Finally, the wool mat is cut and packed in rolls or panels, palletized, and stored for use. Uses Glass wool is a thermal insulation material consisting of intertwined and flexible glass fibers, which causes it to \\"package\\" air, resulting in a low density that can be varied through compression and binder content (as noted above, these air cells are the actual insulator). Glass wool can be a loose-fill material, blown into attics, or together with an active binder, sprayed on the underside of structures, sheets, and panels that can be used to insulate flat surfaces such as cavity wall insulation, ceiling tiles, curtain walls, and ducting. It is also used to insulate piping and for soundproofing. Fiberglass batts and blankets Installing glass wool batts as ceiling insulation Batts are precut, whereas blankets are available in continuous rolls. Compressing the material reduces its effectiveness. Cutting it to accommodate electrical boxes and other obstructions allows air a free path to cross through the wall cavity. One can install batts in two layers across an unfinished attic floor, perpendicular to each other, for increased effectiveness at preventing heat bridging. Blankets can cover joists and studs as well as the space between them. Batts can be challenging and unpleasant to hang under floors between joists; straps, or staple cloth or wire mesh across joists, can hold it up. Gaps between batts (bypasses) can become sites of air infiltration or condensation (both of which reduce the effectiveness of the insulation) and require strict attention during the installation. By the same token careful weatherization and installation of vapour barriers is required to ensure that the batts perform optimally. Air infiltration can be also reduced by adding a layer of cellulose loose-fill on top of the material. Health problems Fiberglass will irritate the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system. Potential symptoms include irritation of eyes, skin, nose, and throat, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), sore throat, hoarseness and cough.Labor, United States Department of (2005), Occupational Safety & Health Administration, Chemical Sampling Information, CAS Registry Number: 65997-17-3 (Fibrous Glass). Fiberglass used for insulating appliances appears to produce human disease that is similar to asbestosis. Scientific evidence demonstrates that fiberglass is safe to manufacture, install and use when recommended work practices are followed to reduce temporary mechanical irritation.North American Insulation Manufacturers Association (\\"NAIMA\\"), Insulation Facts #62 \\"Health and Safety Facts for Fiber Glass\\", Pub. No. N040, May 2012. Unfortunately these work practices are not always followed, and fiberglass is often left exposed in basements that later become occupied. Fiberglass insulation should never be left exposed in an occupied area, according to the American Lung Association. In June 2011, the United States' National Toxicology Program (NTP) removed from its Report on Carcinogens all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products. Similarly, California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (\\"OEHHA\\"), in November 2011, published a modification to its Proposition 65 listing to include only \\"Glass wool fibers (inhalable and biopersistent).\\"46-Z California Regulatory Notice Register, P.1878 (November 18, 2011). The United States' NTP and California's OEHHA action means that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under Federal or California law. All fiberglass wools commonly used for thermal and acoustical insulation were reclassified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in October 2001 as Not Classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).IARC Press Release, 24 October 2001 (http://www.iarc.fr/en/media- centre/pr/2001/pr137.html ) Fiberglass itself is resistant to mold. If mold is found in or on fiberglass it is more likely that the binder is the source of the mold, since binders are often organic and more hygroscopic than the glass wool. In tests, glass wool was found to be highly resistant to the growth of mold. Only exceptional circumstances resulted in mold growth: very high relative humidity, 96% and above, or saturated glass wool, although saturated wool glass will only have moderate growth.

He was the son of King Naemul and Lady Boban, who was the daughter of King Michu. Nulji married the daughter of King Silseong of Silla, who nonetheless exiled Nulji's younger brothers as hostages to Goguryeo of northern Korea and Wa of Japan. Silseong also plotted to have Nulji killed, but with Goguryeo aid, Nulji was able to kill Silseong in 417, after which he ascended to the throne. According to one story, in 418 Nulji sent a loyal retainer named Bak Je-Sang to rescue his brothers from Goguryeo and Wa. He was successful in retrieving the brother who was held in Goguryeo, but he was captured while trying to rescue the one held by Wa. Refusing to serve the Wa king, he died under torture. The story of Bak's loyalty has endured as a popular Korean morality tale. After these difficult events, Nulji worked to free Silla from Goguryeo domination. He set up diplomatic relations with Goguryeo on an equal footing in 424, and established a military alliance with Baekje in 433 to help counter the Goguryeo threat. (Hangul: ÎÇòÏ†úÎèôÎßπ; Hanja: ÁæÖÊøüÂêåÁõü) Nulji's reign saw the continuation of a long process of centralization in Silla, marked his father's change of his title to \\"maripgan\\" (ÎßàÎ¶ΩÍ∞Ñ, È∫ªÁ´ãÂπ≤), which is believed to represent a higher level of authority than the previous title \\"isageum\\" (Ïù¥ÏÇ¨Í∏à, Â∞ºÂ∏´‰ªä). Under Nulji's rule, patrilineal succession was officially established (Yang, 1999, p. 16). After his death in 458, he was succeeded by his son Jabi, rather than by his brother.

William James Linton (December 7, 1812December 29, 1897) was an English-born American wood-engraver, landscape painter, political reformer and author of memoirs, novels, poetry and non-fiction.  Birth and early years  Born in Mile End, east London, his family moved to Stratford, Essex in 1818. The young Linton was educated at Chigwell Grammar School, an early 17th-century foundation attended by many sons of the Essex and City of London middle classes.  Early career  Aged 15, Linton was apprenticed to the wood-engraver George Wilmot Bonner (1796-1836). His earliest known work is to be found in John Martin and Richard Westall's Pictorial Illustrations of the Bible (1833). He worked from 1834 to 1836 with William Henry Powis, another pupil of Bonner; but Powis died. Linton then worked for two years for the firm of John Thompson. After working as a journeyman engraver, losing his money over a cheap political library called the \\"National,\\" and writing a life of Thomas Paine, Linton went into partnership in 1842 with John Orrin Smith. The firm was immediately employed on the Illustrated London News, just then projected. The following year Orrin Smith died, and Linton, who had married a sister of Thomas Wade, editor of Bell's Weekly Messenger, found himself in sole charge of a business upon which two families were dependent.  Political education and activism  Linton's design of the front of The Cornhill Magazine, this copy from December 1945. For years he had concerned himself with the social and European political problems of the time, and was now actively engaged in the republican propaganda. In 1844 he took a prominent part in exposing the violation by the English post office of Mazzini's correspondence. This led to a friendship with the Italian revolutionist, and Linton threw himself with ardor into European politics. He carried the first congratulatory address of English workmen to the French Provisional Government in 1848. He edited a twopenny weekly paper, The Cause of the People, published in the Isle of Man, and he wrote political verses for the Dublin Nation, signed \\"Spartacus.\\" He helped to found the \\"International League\\" of patriots, and, in 1850, with George Henry Lewes and Thornton Leigh Hunt, started The Leader, an organ which, however, did not satisfy his advanced republicanism, and from which he soon withdrew. The same year he wrote a series of articles propounding the views of Mazzini in The Red Republican. In 1852 he took up his residence at Brantwood, which afterward he sold to John Ruskin, and from there issued The English Republic, first in the form of weekly tracts and afterward as a monthly magazine \\"a useful exponent of republican principles, a faithful record ef republican progress throughout the world; an organ of propagandism and a medium of communication for the active republicans in England.\\" Most of the paper, which never paid its way and was abandoned in 1855, was written by himself. In 1852 he also printed for private circulation an anonymous volume of poems entitled The Plaint of Freedom. After the failure of his paper he returned to his proper work of wood-engraving. In 1857 his wife died, and in the following year he married Eliza Lynn (afterward known as Mrs Lynn Linton) and returned to London. The couple moved to Gang Moor on the north-western extremity of Hampstead Heath in 1862. In 1864 he retired to Brantwood, his wife remaining in London.  Emigration to the US  In 1867, pressed by financial difficulties, Linton decided to try his fortune in America. He separated from his wife, with whom, however, he remained in touch. With his children he settled at Appledore, Hamden, Connecticut, where he set up a printing-press. At Hamden Linton he wrote Practical Hints on Wood-Engraving (1879), James Watson, a Memoir of Chartist Times (1879), A History of Wood- Engraving in America (1882), Wood-Engraving, a Manual of Instruction (1884), The Masters of Wood-Engraving, for which he made two journeys to England (1890), The Life of Whittier (1893), and Memories, an autobiography (1895). He died at Hamden on 29 December 1897.  Legacy  Linton was a singularly gifted man, who, in the words of his wife, if he had not bitten the Dead Sea apple of impracticable politics, would have risen higher in the world of both art and letters. As an engraver on wood he reached the highest point of execution in his own line. He carried on the tradition of Bewick, fought for intelligent as against merely manipulative excellence in the use of the graver, and championed the use of the \\"white line\\" as well as of the black, believing with Ruskin that the former was the truer and more telling basis of aesthetic expression in the wood-block printed upon paper.

These are special cases of memory safety violations. More generally, dangling references and wild references are references that do not resolve to a valid destination, and include such phenomena as link rot on the internet. Dangling pointers arise during object destruction, when an object that has an incoming reference is deleted or deallocated, without modifying the value of the pointer, so that the pointer still points to the memory location of the deallocated memory. The system may reallocate the previously freed memory, and if the program then dereferences the (now) dangling pointer, unpredictable behavior may result, as the memory may now contain completely different data. If the program writes to memory referenced by a dangling pointer, a silent corruption of unrelated data may result, leading to subtle bugs that can be extremely difficult to find. If the memory has been reallocated to another process, then attempting to dereference the dangling pointer can cause segmentation faults (UNIX, Linux) or general protection faults (Windows). If the program has sufficient privileges to allow it to overwrite the bookkeeping data used by the kernel's memory allocator, the corruption can cause system instabilities. In object-oriented languages with garbage collection, dangling references are prevented by only destroying objects that are unreachable, meaning they do not have any incoming pointers; this is ensured either by tracing or reference counting. However, a finalizer may create new references to an object, requiring object resurrection to prevent a dangling reference. Wild pointers arise when a pointer is used prior to initialization to some known state, which is possible in some programming languages. They show the same erratic behavior as dangling pointers, though they are less likely to stay undetected because many compilers will raise a warning at compile time if declared variables are accessed before being initialized.https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.0.2/gcc/Warning-Options.html Cause of dangling pointers In many languages (e.g., the C programming language) deleting an object from memory explicitly or by destroying the stack frame on return does not alter associated pointers. The pointer still points to the same location in memory even though it may now be used for other purposes. A straightforward example is shown below: { char *dp = NULL; /* ... */ { char c; dp = &c; } /* c falls out of scope */ /* dp is now a dangling pointer */ } If the operating system is able to detect run-time references to null pointers, a solution to the above is to assign 0 (null) to dp immediately before the inner block is exited. Another solution would be to somehow guarantee dp is not used again without further initialization. Another frequent source of dangling pointers is a jumbled combination of \`malloc()\` and \`free()\` library calls: a pointer becomes dangling when the block of memory it points to is freed. As with the previous example one way to avoid this is to make sure to reset the pointer to null after freeing its reference‚Äîas demonstrated below. #include void func() { char *dp = malloc(A_CONST); /* ... */ free(dp); /* dp now becomes a dangling pointer */ dp = NULL; /* dp is no longer dangling */ /* ... */ } An all too common misstep is returning addresses of a stack-allocated local variable: once a called function returns, the space for these variables gets deallocated and technically they have \\"garbage values\\". int *func(void) { int num = 1234; /* ... */ return # } Attempts to read from the pointer may still return the correct value (1234) for a while after calling \`func\`, but any functions called thereafter may overwrite the stack storage allocated for \`num\` with other values and the pointer would no longer work correctly. If a pointer to \`num\` must be returned, \`num\` must have scope beyond the function‚Äîit might be declared as \`static\`. Manual deallocation without dangling reference (1945-1996) has created a complete object management system which is free of dangling reference phenomenon, seeGianna Cioni, Antoni Kreczmar, Programmed deallocation without dangling reference, Information Processing Letters, v. 18, 1984, pp.179-185 : Scheme of axioms of the operation kill :: Let x1, ... ,xn be variables, n > 0, 1‚â§i‚â§n. Each formula of the following scheme is a theorem of the virtual machine constructed by Kreczmar. ::: \\\\underbrace{(x_1=\\\\dots=x_n eq none)}_{\\\\mathrm{precondition}}\\\\Rightarrow\\\\underbrace{[kill(x_i)]}_{\\\\mathrm{}statement}\\\\underbrace{(x_1=\\\\dots=x_n= none)}_{\\\\mathrm{postcondition}} : read as: if an object o is the value of n variables, then after execution of instruction kill(xi) the common value of these variables is none (it means that from this moment the object o is unreachable and consequently the portion of the memory occupied by it can be by the same operation kill recycled without any harm). Consequently: ::* there is no need to repeat the operation kill(x1), kill(x2), ...In C++ putting the instructions delete(x1,);...delete(xn); is the only way to avoid the error of dangling pointer. ::* there is no phenomenon of dangling reference, ::* any attempt to access the deleted object, will be detected and signalized as an exception ‚Äûreference to none‚Äù. Note: the cost of kill is constant O(1). A similar approach was proposed by Fisher and LeBlanc C.N. Fisher, R.J. Leblanc, The implementation of run-time diagnostics in Pascal , IEEE Trans. Softw. Eng., 6(4):313-319, 1980 under the name Locks-and-keys. Cause of wild pointers Wild pointers are created by omitting necessary initialization prior to first use. Thus, strictly speaking, every pointer in programming languages which do not enforce initialization begins as a wild pointer. This most often occurs due to jumping over the initialization, not by omitting it. Most compilers are able to warn about this. int f(int i) { char *dp; /* dp is a wild pointer */ static char *scp; /* scp is not a wild pointer: * static variables are initialized to 0 * at start and retain their values from * the last call afterwards. * Using this feature may be considered bad * style if not commented */ } Security holes involving dangling pointers Like buffer-overflow bugs, dangling/wild pointer bugs frequently become security holes. For example, if the pointer is used to make a virtual function call, a different address (possibly pointing at exploit code) may be called due to the vtable pointer being overwritten. Alternatively, if the pointer is used for writing to memory, some other data structure may be corrupted. Even if the memory is only read once the pointer becomes dangling, it can lead to information leaks (if interesting data is put in the next structure allocated there) or to privilege escalation (if the now-invalid memory is used in security checks). When a dangling pointer is used after it has been freed without allocating a new chunk of memory to it, this becomes known as a \\"use after free\\" vulnerability. For example, is a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11 being used by zero-day attacks by an advanced persistent threat. Avoiding dangling pointer errors In C, the simplest technique is to implement an alternative version of the \`free()\` (or alike) function which guarantees the reset of the pointer. However, this technique will not clear other pointer variables which may contain a copy of the pointer. #include #include /* Alternative version for 'free()' */ void safefree(void **pp) { /* in debug mode, abort if pp is NULL */ assert(pp); if (pp != NULL) { /* safety check */ free(*pp); /* deallocate chunk, note that free(NULL) is valid */ *pp = NULL; /* reset original pointer */ } } int f(int i) { char *p = NULL, *p2; p = malloc(1000); /* get a chunk */ p2 = p; /* copy the pointer */ /* use the chunk here */ safefree((void **)&p;); /* safety freeing; does not affect p2 variable */ safefree((void **)&p;); /* this second call won't fail */ char c = *p2; /* p2 is still a dangling pointer, so this is undefined behavior. */ return i + c; } The alternative version can be used even to guarantee the validity of an empty pointer before calling \`malloc()\`: safefree(&p;); /* i'm not sure if chunk has been released */ p = malloc(1000); /* allocate now */ These uses can be masked through \`#define\` directives to construct useful macros, creating something like a metalanguage or can be embedded into a tool library apart. In every case, programmers using this technique should use the safe versions in every instance where \`free()\` would be used; failing in doing so leads again to the problem. Also, this solution is limited to the scope of a single program or project, and should be properly documented. Among more structured solutions, a popular technique to avoid dangling pointers in C++ is to use smart pointers. A smart pointer typically uses reference counting to reclaim objects. Some other techniques include the tombstones method and the locks-and-keys method. Another approach is to use the Boehm garbage collector, a conservative garbage collector that replaces standard memory allocation functions in C and C++ with a garbage collector. This approach completely eliminates dangling pointer errors by disabling frees, and reclaiming objects by garbage collection. In languages like Java, dangling pointers cannot occur because there is no mechanism to explicitly deallocate memory. Rather, the garbage collector may deallocate memory, but only when the object is no longer reachable from any references. In the language Rust, the type system has been extended to include also the variables lifetimes and resource acquisition is initialization. Unless one disables the features of the language, dangling pointers will be caught at compile time and reported as programming errors. Dangling pointer detection To expose dangling pointer errors, one common programming technique is to set pointers to the null pointer or to an invalid address once the storage they point to has been released. When the null pointer is dereferenced (in most languages) the program will immediately terminate‚Äîthere is no potential for data corruption or unpredictable behavior. This makes the underlying programming mistake easier to find and resolve. This technique does not help when there are multiple copies of the pointer. Some debuggers will automatically overwrite and destroy data that has been freed, usually with a specific pattern, such as \`0xDEADBEEF\` (Microsoft's Visual C/C++ debugger, for example, uses \`0xCC\`, \`0xCD\` or \`0xDD\` depending on what has been freedVisual C++ 6.0 memory-fill patterns). This usually prevents the data from being reused by making it useless and also very prominent (the pattern serves to show the programmer that the memory has already been freed). Tools such as Polyspace, TotalView, Valgrind, Mudflap,Mudflap Pointer Debugging AddressSanitizer, or tools based on LLVMDhurjati, D. and Adve, V. Efficiently Detecting All Dangling Pointer Uses in Production Servers can also be used to detect uses of dangling pointers. Other tools (SoftBound, Insure++, and CheckPointer) instrument the source code to collect and track legitimate values for pointers (\\"metadata\\") and check each pointer access against the metadata for validity. Another strategy, when suspecting a small set of classes, is to temporarily make all their member functions virtual: after the class instance has been destructed/freed, its pointer to the Virtual Method Table is set to \`NULL\`, and any call to a member function will crash the program and it will show the guilty code in the debugger.  Other uses  The term dangling pointer may also be used in contexts other than programming, especially by technical people. For example, a phone number for a person who has since changed phones is a real-world example of a dangling pointer. Another example is an entry in an online encyclopedia that refers to another entry whose title has been changed, changing any previously existing references to that entry into dangling pointers.

He co-founded and edited The Baffler magazine. Frank has written several books with great impact, most notably What's the Matter with Kansas? (2004) and Listen, Liberal (2016). From 2008 to 2010 he wrote \\"The Tilting Yard\\", a column in The Wall Street Journal. A historian of culture and ideas, Frank analyzes trends in American electoral politics and propaganda, advertising, popular culture, mainstream journalism, and economics. His topics include the rhetoric and impact of culture wars in American political life and the relationship between politics and culture in the United States. Early life Frank was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and grew up in Mission Hills, Kansas. He graduated from Shawnee Mission East High School, and in 1988 from the University of Virginia with a bachelor of arts degree in history after transferring from the University of Kansas in his freshman year. Frank received a master of arts degree in history in 1990 and a doctorate in history in 1994 from the University of Chicago. Politics Frank was a College Republican, but he has come to be highly critical of conservatism, especially the presidency of George W. Bush. Frank summarized the thesis of his book The Wrecking Crew: How Conservatives Rule as \\"[b]ad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.\\" Frank's other writings include essays for Harper's Magazine, Le Monde diplomatique, Bookforum, and the Financial Times. His book What's the Matter with Kansas?, published in 2004, earned him nationwide and international recognition. Since December 2010, Frank has written the monthly \\"Easy Chair\\" column for Harper's Magazine, alternating bi-monthly with writer and journalist Rebecca Solnit. It received little attention at the time, but in Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?

It was released on April 23, 1943 by RKO Radio Pictures. The film's title incorporates two military commands: \\"fall in,\\" meaning to create an organized formation of soldiers, and \\"fall out,\\" to dissolve that formation. Synopsis Donald, an Army private, is on an all-day march with his unit. He keeps up his enthusiasm for the first few miles and starts to mark them off on the pack of the soldier in front of him, but fatigue and unforgiving weather conditions - first rain, then snow, then heat - soon take their toll on him. By the time the unit commander calls a halt for the day, the tally marks cover not only the soldier's pack, but the backs of his arms, legs, and helmet as well. An exhausted and famished Donald quickly dumps out a mountain of gear from his pack, but he is not allowed to eat until he has set up his tent. It takes him only seconds to do this, but the tent soon collapses and he ends up struggling long into the night to set it up again. He dumps a bucket of water over the sagging canvas, causing it to shrink and rip in half. As Donald tries to get some sleep, the peculiar snoring patterns of his fellow soldiers - bugler, drummer, machine gunner, mortar artilleryman - keep waking him up. The moment he passes out from exhaustion, the bugler plays reveille to wake everyone up for the new day. He hurriedly crams all his gear into his pack, now comically bulging out in all directions, but inadvertently lashes it to a tree as he is tying down the cover. When the unit moves out, he stumbles after the other soldiers, uprooting the tree and dragging it along with his pack.

It succeeded the historical Democrat Party and the Justice Party, two parties with similar ideologies. Their sister party is the centrist ƒ∞yi Party. There have been four DYP governments since its foundation; one led by S√ºleyman Demirel, the other three by Turkey's first and only female Prime Minister, Tansu √áiller. The party now has only one in the Grand National Assembly, elected in the lists of the ƒ∞yi Party during the 2018 general election. On 5 May 2007, it was announced that DYP and the Motherland Party (ANAP) would merge to form the Democrat Party (Demokrat Parti). For that occasion, DYP renamed itself (based on the historical Democrat Party), and it was planned that ANAP would join the newly founded DP. Shortly before the election, however, the merging attempt failed. However, ANAP stated it would not contest the upcoming elections. After the DP only got about 6% of the votes in the 2007 general election, Aƒüar resigned as party leader. DYP and the Motherland Party eventually merged in November 2009. The DYP was seen as a centre-right, Kemalist-conservative party. DYP's history spans back to the historical conservative Democrat Party, established in 1946 with the introduction of a multi-party system in Turkish politics. The modern DP's logo, a horse upon a red background, derives from the popular mispronunciation of its name, Demokrat Parti. The word Demokrat did not readily roll off the tongue of rural voters, who found it easier to say Demir Kƒ±rat (\\"iron white horse\\"). After the renaming in mid-2007, the logo became a white horse on a red map of Turkey in order to evoke this mondegreen. History Background The DYP's predecessor was the Democrat Party (, DP), which was a conservative party responsible for relaxing Turkey's strict secularism laws. The party was suppressed in the 1960 military coup d'√©tat and later reestablished as the Justice Party (Adalet Partisi, AP), which was disbanded in the coup of 1980. Both parties staunchly rivaled the social democratic Republican People's Party (CHP). The military overthrew their governments on several occasions: In 1960, the Adnan Menderes government was deposed and Menderes himself was executed; on March 26, 1971, the government of party veteran Demirel was threatened with military intervention and forced to resign; and on September 12, 1980 the military carried out a full-scale coup, suppressing all political parties, including Demirel's AP. Early history (1983‚Äì1991) In 1983, Demirel created the True Path Party (, DYP), the antecedent of the AP ‚Äì still conservative, but now with a secular policy instead of an Islamist one. Even so, the military and conservative governments banned the new party, and the DYP was declared illegal and its members persecuted. Finally, in 1987, the party was legalized, and entered Turkish politics for the first time. It was hugely successful. DYP in government (1991‚Äì1997) In the 1991 general elections, the DYP defeated the Motherland Party (, ANAP) and the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), forming a coalition government with the SHP. S√ºleyman Demirel became Prime Minister once again. After Demirel was elected Turkey's 9th President, following the death of Turgut √ñzal, the party leadership was taken over by Tansu √áiller, who became the country's first woman Prime Minister. In 1995 the coalition with the SHP, now merged with the Republican People's Party (CHP), collapsed. After the December 1995 elections, the weakened DYP formed first a coalition with ANAP, led by Mesut Yƒ±lmaz. Then, in June 1996, the DYP switched allegiances to form Turkey's first Islamist government with the Welfare Party's leader Necmettin Erbakan. DYP in opposition (1999‚Äì2007) In 1997, with the so- called \\"post-modern coup\\", the military effected the RP-DYP government's resignation. In the meantime, the DYP had been weakened by the effects of the Susurluk scandal. DYP and others expected to form a government under √áiller, but President S√ºleyman Demirel asked ANAP leader Mesut Yƒ±lmaz to form the new government instead, and the DYP was not included. In 1998 the DYP took a turn for the worse. The DYP then had heavy recruitment among police intelligence. The DYP secured 9.55% of the vote in the November 2002 general election, slightly under the 10% election threshold to enter parliament. However, a number of independents later joined the party, and, in November 2004, they had 4 seats in Turkey's 549-seat parliament. The figure hardly made the DYP a driving force in Turkish politics, but it remained Turkey's third largest party and particularly influential in rural areas. Tansu √áiller resigned as party leader following the 2002 election defeat, eventually being replaced by Mehmet Aƒüar. Democrat Party (2007‚Äìpresent) On 5 May 2007 it was announced that DYP and the Motherland Party (ANAP) would merge to form the Democrat Party (). For that occasion, DYP renamed itself (based on the previous party of the same name), and it was planned that ANAP would join the newly founded DP. Shortly before the election, however, the merging attempt failed. However, ANAP stated it would not contest the upcoming elections. After the DP only got about 6% of the votes in the 2007 election, Aƒüar resigned as party leader. At the 10th party congress held on January 15, 2011 in Ankara, Namƒ±k Kemal Zeybek was elected as the party leader. After Zeybek's resignation, Gultekin Uysal has become the party leader. In 2018 elections, party participated in the Nation Alliance with the Republican People's Party and the Good Party.

Around 80 species of Varanus are known, 25 of which are found in Australia. This varied group of carnivorous reptiles ranges greatly in size and fills several ecological niches.Ehmann, Harald. Encyclopedia of Australian Animals: Reptiles. (1992), p. 144. Angus&Robertson;, Pymble, Australia. . The goanna features prominently in Aboriginal mythology and Australian folklore. Being predatory lizards, goannas are often quite large, or at least bulky, with sharp teeth and claws. The largest is the perentie (V. giganteus), which can grow over in length. Not all goannas are so large; pygmy goannas may be smaller than the arm of an adult human. The smallest of these, the short-tailed monitor (V. brevicauda) reaches only in length. They survive on smaller prey, such as insects and mice. Goannas combine predatory and scavenging behaviours. They prey on any animal they can catch which is small enough to eat whole. Goannas have been blamed by farmers for the death of sheep, though most likely erroneously, as goannas are also eaters of carrion and are attracted to rotting meat. Toowoomba, Darling Downs, Queensland Most goannas are dark-coloured, with greys, browns, blacks, and greens featuring prominently; however, white is also common. Many desert-dwelling species also feature yellow-red tones. Camouflage ranges from bands and stripes to splotches, speckles, and circles, and can change as the creature matures, with juveniles sometimes being brighter than adults. Like most lizards, goannas lay eggs. Most lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but some species lay their eggs inside termite mounds. This offers protection and incubation; additionally, the termites may provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Unlike some other species of lizards, goannas do not have the ability to regrow limbs or tails. Etymology The name goanna derived from iguana, since early European bush settlers in Australia likened goannas to the South American lizards. Over time, the initial vowel sound was dropped. A similar explanation is used to link possum to the American opossum. Another possibility is that the name might have derived from the South African term for a monitor lizard, leguaan, as the Cape of Good Hope was a popular refresher stop for immigrant ships to Australia from Britain. Species A lace monitor (V. varius) in Byfield National Park For a list of all monitor lizards of the genus, see Complete list of genus Varanus. The following are found in Australia. For the most part, in common names, \\"goanna\\" and \\"monitor\\" are interchangeable. *Perentie - V. giganteus *Lace monitor - V. varius *Sand goanna - V. gouldii (also Gould's goanna or ground goanna) *Mertens' water monitor - V. mertensi *Spiny-tailed monitor - V. acanthurus (also ridge-tailed monitor) *Mangrove monitor - V. semiremex *Black-headed monitor - V. tristis *Short-tailed monitor - V. brevicauda *Argus monitor - V. panoptes (also yellow-spotted monitor) *Rosenberg's monitor - V. rosenbergi *Spencer's goanna - V. spenceri *Storr's monitor - V. storri *Dampier Peninsula monitor - V. sparnus *Mitchell's water monitor - V. mitchelli *Kings' monitor - V. kingorum *Southern Pilbara rock goanna - V. hamersleyensis *Black-palmed rock monitor - V. glebopalma *Kimberley rock monitor - V. glauerti *Pygmy mulga monitor - V. gilleni *Rusty desert monitor - V. eremius *Stripe-tailed goanna - V. caudolineatus *Pilbara monitor - V. bushi *Black-spotted ridge-tailed monitor - V. baritji *Emerald tree monitor - V. prasinus *Canopy goanna - V. keithhornei Habitats Heath goanna (Varanus rosenbergii), Kangaroo Island, South Australia Goannas are found throughout most of Australia, except for Tasmania, and manage to persist in a variety of environments. Most species are known to climb trees or outcrops; several primarily arboreal species are known. The lace monitor (V. varius) is probably the best-known among these, but is not the most common. The lace monitor is the second-largest of all goannas, reaching lengths up to . Other more common tree goannas, such as the Timor tree monitor (V. timorensis) and mournful tree monitor (V. tristis,) do not grow to quite such lengths, typically a maximum of 61 cm, nose-to-tail. Other goannas are adapted to swampy coastal environments, such as the mangrove goanna (V. semiremex). Further still, the Mertens' water monitor (water goanna - V. mertensi), found in lagoons and rivers across northern Australia, is streamlined for swimming, using its tail as a paddle. Most other goannas are good swimmers, but tend not to voluntarily venture into the water. Diet The diets of goannas vary greatly depending on the species and the habitat. Prey can include all manner of small animals: insects, smaller lizards, snakes, mammals, birds, and eggs. Meals are often eaten whole, thus the size of their meals may depend on the size of the animals. Many of the small species feed mostly on insects, with some being small lizard experts. Many of the medium to large species feed on whatever prey they can catch. This includes eggs, fish (V. mertensi), birds, snails, smaller lizards, snakes, marsupials, and other small mammals, such as rodents. The giant perentie has been observed killing a young kangaroo, and then biting out chunks of flesh like a dog. All species are carrion eaters, so feed on the carcasses of dead animals, including livestock and other large creatures. The smell of rotting meat also attracts these lizards. Goannas and humans Mount Coot-tha, Queensland, Australia Confrontations Like most native fauna, goannas are rather wary of human intrusions into their habitat, and most likely run away (into the scrub, up a tree, or into the water, depending on the species). A goanna is a rather swift mover, and when pressed, sprints short distances on its hind legs. Goannas also rear up when threatened, either chased or cornered, and also inflate flaps of skin around their throats and emit harsh hissing noises. Some goannas lose their initial fear of humans, especially when food is involved (or has been previously involved). The wildlife authority recommends not feeding animals while in their territory. An attack can cause serious injury in exceptional cases, but most authorities doubt that a goanna will direct an intentional attack at a human unless the human has attempted to attack it (or grasp at it) first. Indigenous Australians who hunt goannas for food consider the perentie to be a high-risk (but tasty) quarry. Debate is growing as to whether goannas are venomous. The incessant bleeding caused by goanna bites had been thought to be the result of bacterial infection, but a 2005 study suggested monitor lizards (including goannas) are venomous and have oral toxin-producing glands. The goanna's hefty tail can be dangerous when swung, much like a crocodile's tail; small children and dogs have been knocked down by such attacks. Often, victims in goanna attacks are bystanders, watching the person antagonising the goanna. Alarmed goannas can mistake standing humans for trees and attempt to climb them to safety, which is painful and can be distressing.Underhill D (1993) Australia's Dangerous Creatures, Reader's Digest, Sydney, New South Wales, Conservation status Goannas are protected species throughout Australia. Culture and folklore Goannas have a prominent place in the culture of indigenous Australians. This includes totemic relationships, anthropomorphic representations in dreamtime stories, and as a food source. Representations of goannas are common in indigenous artwork, not just as food, but also as a symbolic spiritual motif. Smaller goannas and the mighty perentie are often considered two different animals when appearing in aboriginal works, as in the story \\"How the Goanna and Perentie got their Colours\\". European settlers perpetuated several old wives' tales about goanna habits and abilities; some of these have persisted in modern folklore among campers and bushmen. This includes the above-mentioned exaggeration of goannas dragging off sheep from shepherds' flocks in the night. This might even be exaggerated into child- snatching, rivalling drop bears (attack koalas) as a tourist scarer, but probably more convincing due to the reptiles' carnivorous nature and fearsome appearance. A common tale was that the bite of a goanna was infused with a powerful, incurable venom. Every year after the bite (or every seven years), the wound would flare up again. For many years, herpetologists generally believed goannas were nonvenomous, and lingering illness from their bites was due solely to infection and septicaemia as a result of their saliva being rife with bacteria from carrion and other food sources. However, in 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne announced that oral venom glands had been found in both goannas and iguanas.Goanna venom rocks the reptile record , UniNews Vol. 14, No. 22 28 November - 12 December 2005, University of Melbourne, Retrieved 8 March 2006 Because the goanna regularly eats snakes (which may involve a fierce struggle), including venomous species, they are often said to be immune to snake venom. However, no evidence found suggests an actual venom immunity. Other stories say that the lizard eats a legendary plant, or drinks from a healing spring which neutralises the venom. (This idea is immortalised in Banjo Paterson's humorous poem \\"Johnson's Antidote\\".) Goanna fat or oil has been anecdotally imbued with mystical healing properties (possibly in connection with their supposed venom immunity). Aborigines traditionally used goanna oil as an important bush medicine, and it also became a common medicine among Caucasians shortly after British settlement in Australia. Said to be a cure-all, and possessing amazing powers of penetration (passing through metal as if it were not there), it was sold among early settlers like snake oil in the Old West of North America. A goanna features as the heroic figure 'Mr Lizard' in the Australian author May Gibbs‚Äô children's books Snugglepot and Cuddlepie. A bronze statue of the goanna 'Mr Lizard' has been placed outside the State Library of Victoria. The villain in the Disney film The Rescuers Down Under, Percival C. McLeach, has a pet goanna named Joanna. References Other sources * Cogger, H. (1967). Australian Reptiles in Colour. Sydney: A. H. & A. W. Reed, * King, Dennis & Green, Brian. 1999.

Skam also runs a smaller sub-label called 33. History Skam's first 12-inch single is rumored to have never been officially released, only distributed as a promo. This was a self-titled debut from Lego Feet (Sean Booth and Rob Brown, now known to be the duo Autechre); approximately 100 to 150 copies are believed to exist. The label followed with two 12\\" records from a project known as Gescom, whose members vary between each release. It is \\"an open secret that they're somehow associated with\\" Autechre. Other early Skam releases came from Freeform, Bola, Jega, Team Doyobi, E.Stonji, and Boards of Canada. Boards of Canada's Hi Scores EP, and Gescom's Keynell and Lego Feet have been repressed or reissued. Skam entered the full-length market in 1998 with the releases of Soup by Bola and Music Has the Right to Children by Boards of Canada, the latter being jointly released with Warp Records. A recurring feature on the packaging of Skam releases is the name of the label printed in braille. Series releases Skam makes multiple series of record releases within the label, all of which are an anagram of \\"SKAM\\". The first three records were produced in conjunction with Musik Aus Strom, and the latter two by Skam alone. Up until the 2004 release of Mr 76ix's Hits of 76ix, the label has produced a 7\\" single along with each full-length album; the 7\\" catalogue numbers begin with the letters \\"KMAS\\". Skam has since stated on its website that future KMAS releases will feature purely exclusive tracks to complement full-length recordings of the same number. In 2001, Skam began the \\"SMAK\\" series. Each SMAK 12\\" showcased two artists, one per record side. Some SMAK artists, like Quinoline Yellow, have gone on to become full Skam musicians.

Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in History of British Birds. 1797‚Äì1804. burins), used in wood engraving Wood engraving is a printmaking and letterpress printing technique, in which an artist works an image or matrix of images into a block of wood. Functionally a variety of woodcut, it uses relief printing, where the artist applies ink to the face of the block and prints using relatively low pressure. By contrast, ordinary engraving, like etching, uses a metal plate for the matrix, and is printed by the intaglio method, where the ink fills the valleys, the removed areas. As a result, wood engravings deteriorate less quickly than copper-plate engravings, and have a distinctive white-on-black character. Thomas Bewick developed the wood engraving technique in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century. His work differed from earlier woodcuts in two key ways. First, rather than using woodcarving tools such as knives, Bewick used an engraver's burin (graver). With this, he could create thin delicate lines, often creating large dark areas in the composition. Second, wood engraving traditionally uses the wood's end grain‚Äîwhile the older technique used the softer side grain. The resulting increased hardness and durability facilitated more detailed images. Wood- engraved blocks could be used on conventional printing presses, which were going through rapid mechanical improvements during the first quarter of the 19th century. The blocks were made the same height as, and composited alongside, movable type in page layouts‚Äîso printers could produce thousands of copies of illustrated pages with almost no deterioration. The combination of this new wood engraving method and mechanized printing drove a rapid expansion of illustrations in the 19th century. Further, advances in stereotype let wood-engravings be reproduced onto metal, where they could be mass-produced for sale to printers. By the mid-19th century, many wood engravings rivaled copperplate engravings. Wood engraving was used to great effect by 19th- century artists such as Edward Calvert, and its heyday lasted until the early and mid-20th century when remarkable achievements were made by Eric Gill, Eric Ravilious, Tirzah Garwood and others. Though less used now, the technique is still prized in the early 21st century as a high-quality specialist technique of book illustration, and is promoted, for example, by the Society of Wood Engravers, who hold an annual exhibition in London and other British venues. History This is a large wood-engraving on an 1883 cover of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. Such news prints were composed of multiple component blocks, combined to form a single image, so as to divide the work among a number of engravers. In 15th- and 16th-century Europe, woodcuts were a common technique in printmaking and printing, yet their use as an artistic medium began to decline in the 17th century. They were still made for basic printing press work such as newspapers or almanacs. These required simple blocks that printed in relief with the text‚Äîrather than the elaborate intaglio forms in book illustrations and artistic printmaking at the time, in which type and illustrations were printed with separate plates and techniques. The beginnings of modern wood engraving techniques developed at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the works of Englishman Thomas Bewick. Bewick generally engraved harder woods, such as boxwood, rather than the woods used in woodcuts, and he engraved the ends of blocks instead of the side. Finding a woodcutting knife not suitable for working against the grain in harder woods, Bewick used a burin (or graver), an engraving tool with a V-shaped cutting tip. As Thomas Balston explains, Bewick abandoned the attempts of previous wood-engravers 'to imitate the black lines of copper engravings. Though not, as frequently asserted, the inventor of wood- engraving, he was the first to recognise that, as the incisions made by the graver on the wood block printed white, the right use of the medium was to base his designs as much as possible on white lines and areas, and so he became the first to use his graver as a drawing instrument and to employ the medium as an original art.‚ÄòThomas Balston, English Wood-Engraving, 1900-1950 (London: Art & Technics, 1951), p. 4. From the beginning of the nineteenth century Bewick's techniques gradually came into wider use, especially in Britain and the United States. Alexander Anderson introduced the technique to the United States. Bewick's work impressed him, so he reverse engineered and imitated Bewick's technique‚Äîusing metal until he learned that Bewick used wood. There it was further expanded upon by his students, Joseph Alexander Adams. Growth of illustrated publications Besides interpreting details of light and shade, from the 1820s onwards, engravers used the method to reproduce freehand line drawings. This was, in many ways an unnatural application, since engravers had to cut away almost all the surface of the block to produce the printable lines of the artist's drawing. Nonetheless, it became the most common use of wood engraving. Examples include the cartoons of Punch magazine, the pictures in the Illustrated London News and Sir John Tenniel's illustrations to Lewis Carroll's works, the latter engraved by the firm of Dalziel Brothers. In the United States, wood-engraved publications also began to take hold, such as Harper's Weekly. Frank Leslie, a British-born engraver who had headed the engraving department of the Illustrated London News, immigrated to the United States in 1848, where he developed a means to divide the labor for making wood engravings. A single design was divided into a grid, and each engraver worked on a square. The blocks were then assembled into a single image. This process formed the basis for his Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, which competed with Harper's in illustrating scenes from the American Civil War. New techniques and technologies The modified technique in the wood-engraving Crucifixion of Jesus designed by Gustave Dor√©. By the mid-19th century, electrotyping was developed, which could reproduce a wood engraving on metal. By this method, a single wood- engraving could be mass-produced for sale to printshops, and the original retained without wear. Until 1860, artists working for engraving had to paint or draw directly on the surface of the woodblock and the original artwork was actually destroyed by the engraver. In 1860, however, the engraver Thomas Bolton invented a process for transferring a photograph onto the block. At about the same time, French engravers developed a modified technique (partly a return to that of Bewick) in which cross-hatching (one set of parallel lines crossing another at an angle) was almost entirely eliminated. Instead, all tonal gradations were rendered by white lines of varying thickness and closeness, sometimes broken into dots for the darkest areas. This technique appears in wood-engravings after Gustave Dor√©. Towards the end of the 19th century, a combination of Bolton's 'photo on wood' process and the increased technical virtuosity initiated by the French school gave wood engraving a new application as a means of reproducing drawings in water-colour wash (as opposed to line drawings) and actual photographs. This is exemplified in illustrations in The Strand Magazine during the 1890s. With the new century, improvements in the half-tone process rendered this kind of reproductive engraving obsolete. In a less sophisticated form, it survived in advertisements and trade catalogues until about 1930. With this change, wood engraving was left free to develop as a creative form in its own right, a movement prefigured in the late 1800s by such artists as Joseph Crawhall II and the Beggarstaff Brothers. Timothy Cole was a traditional wood engraver, executing copies from museum paintings on commission from magazines such as The Century Magazine. Technique Wood engraving blocks are typically made of boxwood or other hardwoods such as lemonwood or cherry. They are expensive to purchase because end-grain wood must be a section through the trunk or large bough of a tree. Some modern wood engravers use substitutes made of PVC or resin, mounted on MDF, which produce similarly detailed results of a slightly different character. The block is manipulated on a \\"sandbag\\" (a sand- filled circular leather cushion). This helps the engraver produce curved or undulating lines with minimal manipulation of the cutting tool. Wood engravers use a range of specialized tools. The lozenge graver is similar to the burin used by copper engravers of Bewick's day, and comes in different sizes. Various sizes of V-shaped graver are used for hatching. Other, more flexible, tools include the spitsticker, for fine undulating lines; the round scorper for curved textures; and the flat scorper for clearing larger areas. Wood engraving is generally a black-and-white technique. However, a handful of wood engravers also work in colour, using three or four blocks of primary colours‚Äîin a way parallel to the four-colour process in modern printing. To do this, the printmaker must register the blocks (make sure they print in exactly the same place on the page). Recently, engravers have begun to use lasers to engrave wood.

The music was generally rooted in the big bands of the swing era of the 1930s and 1940s, but was also influenced by rockabilly, boogie-woogie, the jump blues of Louis Prima and the theatrics of Cab Calloway, though some neo-swing bands practiced contemporary fusions with rock, punk rock and ska music. History The roots of the swing revival are generally traced back to 1989, which saw the formation of several of the scene's most prominent figures: Los Angeles' Royal Crown Revue and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, who stuck close to playing traditionally-styled jump blues and rockabilly, San Francisco's Lavay Smith & Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers, who showcased vocal jazz and blues influences, and Eugene, Oregon's Cherry Poppin' Daddies, who incorporated elements of punk rock and ska into swing and jazz music. California soon emerged as the epicenter for the burgeoning neo-swing movement, with such clubs as Los Angeles' Brown Derby and San Francisco's Club DeLuxe regularly hosting swing and jazz bands as well as offering free swing dancing lessons. By the early 1990s, swing music had started appearing in popular culture, serving as the focal point of the 1993 drama Swing Kids while featuring heavily in the 1994 comedy The Mask, in which Royal Crown Revue made an on-screen cameo. By this time, retro swing had started expanding outside of its West Coast roots, leading to the formation of swing bands in such places as Texas (8¬Ω Souvenirs, The Lucky Strikes), Michigan (The Atomic Fireballs, The Deluxtone Rockets), North Carolina (Squirrel Nut Zippers) and Canada (Big Rude Jake, Johnny Favourite Swing Orchestra).A Brief History of Swing in Austin, The Austin Swing Syndicate, web site In 1996, the American comedy Swingers, which featured scenes filmed at The Derby and a musical performance by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, became a critical and commercial success and is frequently credited with bringing the swing revival into the cultural mainstream. In April 1997, the Squirrel Nut Zippers' 1996 single \\"Hell\\" appeared on the Billboard charts, effectively becoming the first hit song of the swing revival; their album Hot would achieve platinum sales of one million units by the RIAA by December 1997. In March 1997, the Cherry Poppin' Daddies released their swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot, attaining platinum status in August 1998 and double-platinum status in January 2000 while its titular single peaked at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, which was founded by former Stray Cats frontman Brian Setzer in 1992, also achieved double-platinum sales with their 1998 album The Dirty Boogie, whose cover of Louis Prima's 1956 song \\"Jump, Jive an' Wail\\" became the highest- charting single of swing revival, peaking at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

Career Watson was born on 27 August 1926, and grew up on a sugar farm in Queensland. He began his career as an actor at the age of sixteen on Australian radio firstly as an actor and then as an announcer, before moving to the UK in 1955. He was soon hired by ATV and in 1956, joined Ned Sherrin and Noele Gordon in Birmingham to establish the base of ATV Midlands where his job was as Head Of Light Entertainment. In this role, he created many programmes for the station with his first big hit being the live daily chat show, Lunchbox. It ran from 1956 to 1964 to over 3,000 editions with its presenter, Noele Gordon, becoming a regional celebrity. In 1958, Watson submitted a proposal to ATV for a new Midlands based soap opera, however it was not until 1964 that Lew Grade, head of the company, granted approval for a series. Initially called The Midland Road, the project was renamed Crossroads by Watson just before its run began. Created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling, it achieved audiences of 18 million. After ten years producing Crossroads and eighteen years at ATV, he decided to return to Australia in 1973. Upon his return home, he took up the post of head of drama at Reg Grundy Productions. Thanks to his popular British soap, he was able to create many more series in Australia including Until Tomorrow (1975), The Young Doctors (1976), The Restless Years (1977), Prisoner (1979), Taurus Rising (1981), Sons and Daughters (1981), Waterloo Station (1983), Starting Out (1983), Possession (1985), Richmond Hill (1988). The Young Doctors, Prisoner, Sons and Daughters and Richmond Hill later aired in the UK. The prominence he gained from Sons and Daughters helped his idea for Neighbours to be picked up by the Seven Network in 1985. After being cancelled by Seven that year due to low ratings, it switched to the Ten Network at the start of 1986 and slowly its ratings climbed. The show still airs on channel 11 and is the longest-running drama series in Australian television history. At the 47th Annual TV Week Logie Awards held on 1 May 2005, Neighbours became the 22nd inductee into the TV Week Hall of Fame. Watson also dabbled in television in the US, producing Dangerous Women, a short-lived soap opera based on the Australian Prisoner series. Personal life Watson was a private man and rarely gave interviews. He retired in 1992 and did not produce any new television drama from then onwards. On 26 January 2010, Watson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for services to the media as a pioneer in the creation and production of serial television drama. On 8 October 2019, Watson died aged 93, after a short illness. Neighbours announced his death on their official Twitter account. The show's executive producer, Jason Herbison described Watson as a \\"pioneer of drama\\". While writer Bevan Lee called him \\"a trailblazer in Australian commercial television drama\\". Both Lee and television historian Andrew Mercado believed Watson should be inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.

The main watercourse through the municipality is the Rio Doce river (\\"Doce\\" means sweet in Portuguese) whose basin (of 83,500 square kilometers) is composed of 222 municipalities.  History  Situated in the valley of the Rio Doce, Baixo Guandu occupies a prominent place in the political and socio-economical development of Esp√≠rito Santo. The county was created on April 10, 1935, it was initially colonized by migrants from Cantagalo Rio de Janeiro and European immigrants, especially from Italy and Germany. The history of Baixo Guandu is directly linked to the pioneering spirit that marked the beginning of the 20th century in the valley of Rio Doce. The rails of the first train arrived in 1907 and the economic activities were intensified. The abundant wood was removed and taken by train to the capital. According to the testimony of bandeirantes and travelers who have visited the lower Rio Doce since the second half of the 20th century by the middle of last century, the Indians Botocudos native sons and daughters were masters of the region between Rio Doce and the River S√£o Mateus. The first penetration in the territory of the Baixo Guandu, the former jurisdiction of the municipality of Colatina occurred in 1875, when the major Jos√© Vieira de Carvalho Milagres, veteran Paraguayan War reaches the confluence of the Rio Doce river Guandu and there down the core leading to the city. The colonization of the region, initiated by major Milagres, had his base-grounded in the work of European immigrants of various origins, located in the colonial core of Afonso Pena, today Ibituba. The foreign colonists settled in the valley of the guandu and the other Ribeir√£o do Lage. On both sides, there are still today the hallmarks of the European heritage in the region. The Italians came in Baixo Guandu in 1866 by the initiative of Mr. Francisco Vieira de Carvalho Milagres. A Prov√≠ncia do Esp√≠rito Santo of June 2, 1866, reported that Mr. Milagres written to his friend Guilherme Frederico, announcing the departure of Genoa, with forty contractors. Days later, came, in fact, from Rio de Janeiro, forty Italians, for their lands in the Rio Doce (June 5, 1866). The farmer and settler Francisco Vieira de Carvalho Milagres returned to Europe in 1894, in order to bring more workers to his land. The immigrants arrived in the Matteo Bruzzo, as the news of the State of the Espirito Santo of December 8 of the same year and, on 10, went to Rio Doce, and from there, took their destination, where even today, there are their descendants. As if it had been the desire to repair the abolition of the District of Baixo Guandu, President Henrique da Silva Coutinho created the colony of 1905, including this area is not legitimate Baixo Guandu, to the limits with the municipality of Afonso Cl√°udio and Minas Gerais. Divided and donated a portion of the batch, they were sold to Italian, French, German, and Spanish settlers them crowded. The farmer Francisco da Cunha Ramaldes, born in 1861, son of Jos√© da Cunha Ramaldes and Balbina Maria de Jesus, from Lajinha do Chal√©, State of Minas Gerais, establishes in 1910 in the mountain region of Alto Mutum Preto where he initiates a very lucrative coffee plantation. Baixo Guandu was the first Brazilian city to receive water treated with fluoride in 1953 in order to reduce the incidence of caries, especially among children. In 1974, was inaugurated in the city's largest hydroelectric plant in the state, providing power to the Esp√≠rito Santo and Minas Gerais.

Written by Margaret Armen and directed by Gene Nelson, it was first broadcast January 5, 1968. In the episode, Captain Kirk and his companions are abducted into slavery and trained to fight as gladiators for the gambling entertainment of three disembodied beings. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise is on a routine inspection of an unmanned station at Gamma II. Captain Kirk, Communications Officer Lt. Uhura and navigator Ensign Chekov attempt to transport, but disappear before the system is activated. Observing no signs of life from the station, Commander Spock orders a system-wide search for their missing crew members. No trace of them is found, but Spock discovers a faint ion trail, and orders the ship to follow it despite the protests of Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Chief Engineer Scott. Meanwhile, Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov find themselves in a gladiator arena on a strange planet. They are attacked by four humanoids and defend themselves for a time but are finally subdued. A humanoid calling himself Galt, Master Thrall of Triskelion, informs the three they are to be trained to participate in games to entertain his masters, the Providers. Each is fitted with a \\"collar of obedience\\" that engages when they disobey the Master Thrall's orders. Uhura, Chekov, and Kirk are assigned individual \\"drill thralls\\": Lars, Tamoon, and Shahna, respectively; Uhura and Chekov do not get along comfortably with their instructors, but Kirk develops a rapport with Shahna. After a period of training, the Providers bid for the new thralls in their currency, \\"quatloos\\". During a run among ancient ruins outside the arena complex, Kirk tries to gain information about the Providers from Shahna, but her collar is activated when she begins to speak too freely. Kirk protests that he should have been the one punished, and when they are returned to their cells, Shahna expresses her appreciation for this. When she moves to embrace him, Kirk knocks her unconscious, and uses her key to free himself, Uhura, and Chekov, but they are stopped by Galt. The Enterprise follows the ion trail where they find a planet with a humanoid settlement. As Spock and McCoy prepare to beam down, the voice of Provider One warns them not to make the attempt. Kirk's voice is also heard, and he brings them up to date. Kirk then challenges the Providers to show themselves and finds himself in an underground chamber, where the Providers are revealed to be three disembodied brains. Kirk offers them a wager: he and his two officers will fight an equal number of thralls. If Kirk and his party win, the Providers will free them, give up their games, and teach the thralls to govern themselves. If they lose, the entire Enterprise crew will become thralls. The Providers agree, but stipulate that Kirk must battle three thralls alone. The match is quickly arranged and, as the Enterprise crew watches from above, Kirk is able to kill two thralls and injure a third. Galt sends in Shahna. Kirk manages to subdue her, and she surrenders. The Providers declare that Kirk has won the wager and unlock the thralls' collars. Shahna expresses a desire to follow Kirk to the stars, but he answers that she and the other thralls must first learn to live in their newfound freedom. Cultural impact The duel was parodied in the Simpsons episode \\"Deep Space Homer\\", with onlooking NASA scientists wagering quatloos as Homer Simpson fights in an arena. Kirk's speech to Shahna about love was referenced in the South Park episode \\"Hooked on Monkey Fonics\\". The scene in the South Park episode is taken from this Star Trek episode \\"complete with similar incidental music\\". The popular Star Trek catchphrase \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" is a common misquotation, with The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations stating that the nearest equivalent is the phrase uttered in this episode: \\"Scotty, beam us up.\\" Television studies The episode has been mentioned and discussed in a number of works of television studies. In Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon (2013), the episode is compared to the \\"Green Ice/Deep Freeze\\" episode pairing in the 1960s Batman television series. \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\" is also described in Modern Amazons: Warrior Women on Screen (2006), with the character Shahna dressed in \\"traditional Amazonian attire\\" and the episode being given as an example of female domination. The authors also note that the episode was one of the few Classic Star Trek episodes written by a woman (17 of its 79 episodes were written or co-written by women) and that Margaret Armen was a \\"veteran of warrior women shows like Wonder Woman and The Big Valley\\", although Armen's lone Wonder Woman episode dates from several years after Star Trek ceased production. The themes of religion and philosophy in this episode are discussed in Robert Asa's detailed critique of the Star Trek episode \\"Who Mourns for Adonais?\\". Asa notes that god-figures, such as those featured in \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\" are \\"consistently disappointing, decadent and/or dangerous\\" and that specifically the Providers of Triskelion use \\"humanoids as playthings for personal amusement\\". The episode \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\" is cited by American literary and media critic Paul A. Cantor as an example of 'the end of history'. In a footnote to his 2001 work, Cantor draws parallels between this episode and Hegelian philosophy, referring to the prediction of Alexandre Koj√®ve regarding gambling and concluding that Kirk dragged the Triskelions \\"back into history [...] reinaugurating a kind of Hegelian dialectic of masters and slaves\\". Production details It was produced after John Meredyth Lucas had taken over for Gene L. Coon as the program's operating producer at the latter's request. Gerald Perry \\"Jerry\\" Finnerman was the director of photography for the installment, and his cinematography protege, Al Francis, was chief camera operator. The episode was originally titled \\"The Gamesters of Pentathlan\\". The original script called for Sulu instead of Chekov, but George Takei was away filming The Green Berets at the time. Reception In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the 12th \\"best worst\\" Star Trek episode of the original series, noting its entertainment value. In 2016, TVline ranked this as having one of the top twenty moments of Star Trek, when Kirk not only spares the life of his defeated opponent, but also convinces the alien authority to allow a free society.

The second Perch (SS‚Äì313) was laid down 5 January 1943 by the Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; launched 12 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. David A. Hart; and commissioned 7 January 1944, Lt. Comdr. Blish C. Hills in command. After shakedown she departed 19 February 1944 for Key West, Fla., where she gave services to the Fleet Sound School. She then sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 3 April. First and second war patrols, April ‚Äì August 1944 On 29 April she departed Pearl Harbor with for Midway where joined them. The South China Sea was the hunting ground for the wolf pack. Early in the morning of 24 May, a medium tanker was contacted and damaged by four torpedo hits. The counterattack by a lone escort prevented further observation of the damage inflicted and knocked out both high pressure air compressors by flooding of the pump room. Perch headed for the Marshall Islands, arriving at Majuro on 4 June. On 27 June Perch began her second war patrol, this time off Surigao Strait in the Philippines. She sank a 100-ton Japanese trawler with gunfire before returning to Pearl Harbor 26 August. Third and fourth war patrols, September 1944 ‚Äì February 1945 Perch departed Pearl Harbor on her third war patrol 19 September. At Midway she joined submarines and and the three set out for the confined waters of the East China and Yellow Seas. Perch unsuccessfully attacked one heavily escorted transport, and performed lifeguard duty supporting B-29 raids on Honsh≈´. Perch then headed for Saipan to refuel en route to Brisbane, Australia, for duty with Submarines, Southwest Pacific Fleet. The fourth war patrol began 19 December from Brisbane. First Perch patrolled off Hainan, China; next off Singapore; and finally in Balabac Straits off Borneo. She sighted no enemy ships, and the patrol ended at Fremantle, Western Australia, 15 February 1945. Fifth and sixth war patrols, March ‚Äì June 1945 On 12 March Perch departed Fremantle carrying with her eleven Australasian specialists trained in commando warfare, under the command of Major Donald Stott. On the first night of the mission, in the Makassar Straits, above Balikpapan, Borneo, she landed four of the party (including Stott) who were to make a reconnaissance of the beach and surrounding territory. Coming in close ashore two nights later to disembark the remainder of the party, Perch contacted a 300-ton coastal freighter that threatened to cut off her return to open water. She engaged it with gunfire and the second hit caused the freighter burst into flames and sink.Operational History, USS Perch, SS-313 The first party were never heard from again. It was speculated that the engine which powered the officers kyak was heard. Locals believed they had been captured and executed by the Japanese. The second party rowed ashore, and placed their charges to blow up an oil supply pipeline. They were closely chased by Japanese patrols, but escaped by taking a small boat off the island. They were picked up well out to sea by a Catalina on patrol; only two of the party survived. Perch returned to Fremantle, Western Australia, completing her fifth war patrol. On 15 April Perch departed Fremantle on her sixth war patrol and journeyed to the Java Sea to hunt out the enemy. When she contacted a convoy of two ships, an alert Japanese escort discovered Perch and subjected her to a severe two-hour depth charging which caused considerable damage throughout the boat. She then sailed to the China coast to patrol off Hainan before returning to Pearl Harbor 5 June. Seventh war patrol, July ‚Äì August 1945 On 11 July Perch departed Pearl Harbor and after fueling at Saipan, proceeded north for duty in the \\"Lifeguard League\\" off Japan. On 13 August she rescued a Navy Corsair pilot from the water two miles (3 km) offshore, bombarded fishing vessels and buildings on the beach, and retired to sea. A few hours later the same day, she picked up another pilot from the same fighter squadron five miles (8 km) offshore. Two days later Japan capitulated and Perch returned to Pearl Harbor 30 August. Conversion to transport submarine; Korean War Perch after her conversion into a transport submarine (ASSP-313). Perch departed Pearl Harbor and set course for the Golden Gate, arriving Hunter's Point 8 September. She decommissioned and was placed in reserve in January 1947. On 19 January 1948 Perch was redesignated as a Submarine Transport, SSP‚Äì313, and was placed in an active status, attached to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Perch recommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 20 May 1948, Lt. Comdr. O. H. Payne in command. Through 1949, the ship participated in various troop- and cargo-carrying exercises. On 31 January 1950 Perch was reclassified a \\"transport submarine,\\" ASSP-313. In September 1950 Perch transported a force from Britain's 41 (Independent) Commando Royal Marines in a raid on the northeast coast of Korea west of Tanchon.How U.S. Submarines Helped Special Troops Destroy Enemy Supply Lines in the Korean War The target, a train tunnel on the north-south supply line, was destroyed, with the loss of one man who was buried at sea. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander R. D. Quinn, became the only submarine commanding officer to receive a combat award during the Korean War when he was awarded the Bronze Star for this action. During this time, the Perch was fitted with a large sausage shaped hangar on her aft deck. Operational tests were made with both helicopter and amphibious boats.\\"Sea Power for Security\\", a U.S. Navy Photographic Center film clip MN 9294, 1954. 1950s Perch (APSS-313), polar icecap, 1952‚Äì53. From August 1951 to March 1952, Perch underwent overhaul at Mare Island. From 1952 to 1954, Perch trained, making \\"reconnaissance-runs\\" and \\"raids\\" on several Alaskan and Hawaiian islands. In January 1955 Perch made a cruise to WestPac conducting a \\"reconnaissance and raid\\" on Iwo Jima and observed other islands in the Bonin Chain. Periods between Far Eastern cruises, Perch performed type training and intertype amphibious exercises in the San Diego area. Perch, again classified as a Submarine Transport, APSS-313, on 24 October 1956, departed San Diego 5 November for a reconnaissance exercise in the Panama Canal Area, returning to San Diego 11 December. In late 1957 she made a reconnaissance voyage from San Diego to Hawaii and Alaska, and spent most of 1958 and 1959 in amphibious training exercises in the San Diego area with marines and Underwater Demolition Teams. In December 1959 Perch departed San Diego, decommissioned on 31 March 1960, and entered the Mare Island Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Vallejo, Calif. 1960s Perch recommissioned 11 November 1961, Lt. Comdr. C.H. Hedgepeth in command, trained on the West Coast and Hawaii through 1962, and arrived at her new homeport, Subic Bay, Philippine Islands in March 1963. Her operations consisted of training the U.S. Marine's Amphibious Recon Battalion, Army Special Forces, and Navy UDTs in reconnaissance and also in providing training services to allied countries. In May and June 1964 Perch traveled to Mindoro and trained with British commando forces. July and August were spent in Hong Kong, Pohong Bay, Korea (with R.O.K. Special Forces), Yokosuka and Okinawa, Japan. March and April 1965, saw Perch participating in exercise \\"Jungle Drum III\\" by landing 75 Marine Corps reconnaissance personnel on the Malay Peninsula from the Gulf of Siam. Perch conducted search and rescue operations in the Vietnam combat zone during August and September. She made two amphibious landings on the coast of South Vietnam during November and December as part of Operation Dagger Thrust. During January Perch landed UDT personnel for beach survey work in South Vietnam as part of Operation Double Eagle. She then provided services at Legaspi, Philippines to train Filipino and American UDT personnel. Between local training operations in the Subic Bay area, Perch worked with Chinese Special Forces at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and with Army Special Forces at Keelung, Taiwan. In July Perch participated in Operation Deckhouse II on the coast of South Vietnam. Again in August, Perch conducted several independent beach surveys with UDT personnel along the coast of South Vietnam. For Operation Deckhouse IV in September Perch landed UDT personnel on five successive nights for preinvasion beach reconnaissance. On 7 October 1966, Perch headed for Pearl Harbor via Hong Kong, Palau Islands, Guam, and Midway Island. She operated in Hawaiian waters until 1967 when she became Naval Reserve Training submarine at San Diego. On 22 August 1968 Perch's classification was changed from APSS‚Äì313 to Submarine Transport LPSS‚Äì313. Fate Perch was designated an Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarine IXSS-313 on 30 June 1971. She was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register on 1 December 1971 and was sold for scrapping on 15 January 1973.

Background The Independent Electoral Commission had a campaign to encourage voter registration, with a target of registering at 500,000 voters. Although it achieved its target, registering around 61% of the estimated 900,000 voting-age population, the opposition Botswana National Front (BNF) accused it of making errors in the registration process. Campaign For the first time, the election campaign involved parties using billboards. However, the opposition claimed that their media access was restricted, and a study by the Media Institute of Southern Africa showed that the BDP had received over 50% of the election coverage. The BDP campaigned on promises to improve training, expand electricity and water supplies and amend laws that discriminated against women. The campaign of the opposition parties focussed on unemployment and poverty. However, although the BNF, Botswana Alliance Movement (BAM) and Botswana People's Party (BPP), entered into an electoral pact agreement in 2003, their campaigns were marked by open personal attacks between them and their leaders. Fifty-six of the 57 constituencies were contested, with Vice President Ian Khama unopposed in the Serowe North constituency.

Although born Jacques de Liniers in France, he is more widely known by the Spanish form of his name, Santiago de Liniers. He was popularly regarded as the hero of the reconquest of Buenos Aires after the first British invasion of the R√≠o de la Plata. As a result of his success, he was appointed as viceroy, replacing Rafael de Sobremonte. It was unprecedented for a viceroy to be replaced without the King's direct intervention. But he was confirmed in office by Charles IV of Spain. He defended the settlement against a second British invasion attempt and a mutiny that sought to replace him. He was replaced in 1809 by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed as viceroy by the Junta of Seville, and retired from public activity. But when the May Revolution took place, Liniers decided to come out of his retirement and organized a monarchist uprising in C√≥rdoba. Liniers was forced to flee, but was eventually captured, and executed without trial. Biography Early life Santiago de Liniers y Bremond, Cavalier of the Order of Saint John, Cavalier of the Order of Montesa, Captain in the Spanish Royal Navy was born in Niort, France, as Jacques, 4th son of Jacques Joseph Louis, comte de Liniers (1723‚Äì1785) and captain of the French Navy, and Henriette Th√©r√®se de Br√©mond d'Ars (1725‚Äì1770).Groussac, p. 30 The Liniers family was a noble French family, known since the 11th century. One of its ancestors, Guillaume de Liniers, died in the Battle of Poitiers (1356). Eight members were Cavaliers of the Order of Saint John.Groussac, p. 29 In 1765, when Jacques was 12 years old, he entered the military school at the Order of Malta. (As a younger son, he was unlikely to inherit the title and land, so was sent to military school in order to have a career.) After three years, he graduated with the Cross of Cavalier (1768). He was commissioned as a Sub- Lieutenant of Cavalry in the in France.Groussac, pp. 30‚Äì32 Viceroy of the R√≠o de la Plata.Demar√≠a & Molina de Castro 2001, p. 322-325. Serving the Spanish Crown In 1774 Liniers requested dismissal and re-enlisted as a volunteer in the campaigns against the Moors in Algiers. He benefited from the third Pacte de Famille (1761), which allowed Frenchmen to take part in Spanish military campaigns with equal rights and requirements as the Spaniards. At the campaign's conclusion, Liniers took an exam as a Midshipman in C√°diz, to serve as a volunteer for the Spanish Crown. In 1775 he earned the rank of Ensign in the Spanish Navy.Groussac, pp. 32‚Äì33 In 1776, under the orders of Pedro de Cevallos, Liniers sailed to the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata and took part on the occupation of Santa Catarina Island in Brazil and the attack on Colonia del Sacramento (modern day Uruguay).Groussac, pp. 33‚Äì34 In 1779, Liniers was an officer on the San Vicente. Spain joined the Franco-American alliance in the American Revolutionary War as a renewal of the Bourbon Family Compact. The San Vicente was part of the Spanish-French Naval Squadron fighting the British Royal Navy in South America.Groussac, pp. 34‚Äì35 Liniers distinguished himself during the American Revolution. In 1780, with a few sloops, he captured a three-masted ship of 24 guns. In 1782, he distinguished himself particularly in the siege of Port Mahon: under fire, he moved to where two British ships had collided, which were laden with arms and ammunition. He seized the ships and conveyed them to the Spanish lines. He was promoted to Frigate Captain.Groussac, pp. 34‚Äì35 A few months later Liniers took part in a new expedition, this time against the city of Algiers, in North Africa, which was the main base of the Barbary corsairs, with the aim of forcing them to stop piracy and the Barbary slave trade. As the campaign did not go well for the Spanish navy, Madrid tried to negotiate instead. Liniers was entrusted with this mission. The king of Tripoli was delighted with Liniers, and agreed to free several European prisoners. The Barbary pirates associated with North Africa had long been attacking European shipping in the Mediterranean, and had taken numerous prisoners over the years.Groussac, pp. 35‚Äì36 The Spanish court rewarded Liniers for this diplomatic success, promoting him to the rank of captain and entrusting him with the command of the R√≠o de la Plata in 1788 to organize a flotilla of gunships. Liniers took with him his son Luis and his first wife, Juana de Menviel, whom he had married in M√°laga. She died two years later in 1790. Liniers married again, this time in Buenos Aires, to Mar√≠a Martina Sarratea, daughter of one of the richest merchants of Buenos Aires.Groussac, p. 36 First British Invasion William Carr Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, painting by Charles Fouqueray. The Napoleonic Wars expanded to South America. Britain gained naval supremacy over France with its victory at the battle of Trafalgar. France attacked Britain by imposing the Continental System, locking the continent to British trade. Needing new markets, Britain attacked Buenos Aires and Montevideo, two Spanish colonies in South America (Spain was allied to France in the war). Home Riggs Popham attempted to invade Buenos Aires, without official orders. He knew the risk: if he succeeded, Britain would honour his deed, but if he failed, he would be condemned for it.Groussac, pp. 39‚Äì41 June 23, 1806, a British expeditionary force of 1,700 men landed on the left bank of the R√≠o de la Plata and invaded Buenos Aires, which had been abandoned by the Viceroy. Liniers remained in the city in disguise, staying in the Dominican convent. At the altar of the Virgin, he vowed to return with the flags of the occupiers. He escaped to Montevideo and, with the help of its governor Pascual Ruiz Huidobro, galvanized the people, raising a troop of 1,200 volunteers. He embarked with this liberation army on a few schooners, which joined a French privateer corvette. Landing on August 4, Liniers and his men rushed across the marshes to Buenos Aires. The city was recovered after fierce street fighting that ended with the storming of the cathedral, which had been fortified by the British. British General William Carr Beresford capitulated and offered his sword; true to Liniers's vow, British flags (those of the Highlanders regiment and Green St. Helena) were transferred to the church of the convent of the Dominicans, where they are still held. British naval red ensign surrendered during the second British invasion in 1807 and offered by viceroy Santiago de Liniers, in gratitude for the victory, to Our Lady of the Rosary at the Santo Domingo church, in C√≥rdoba, Argentina. Designation as viceroy After the victory, the society stayed on military alert, suspecting that the British might counterattack. The Buenos Aires Cabildo called an open cabildo to discuss the next steps, including the actions to take regarding viceroy Sobremonte. They decided to prevent the viceroy from returning to the city, and appoint Liniers, who was regarded as a hero, as commander-in-chief. Sobremonte accepted, and moved to Montevideo. Liniers drafted all the male population capable of bearing arms, including African slaves, into the defense of the city. He arranged for each regiment to vote for its officers.De Titto, p. 41 All the lead in the city was confiscated (even pipes and cutlery) to be melted into ordnance. The Cabildo requested other cities to lend gunpowder, and the horses were trained to ignore the noise of cannon shots. A new British task force, much larger than the first one, arrived the next year. It was led by Samuel Auchmuty, later replaced by John Whitelocke. This time they attacked Montevideo, which fell under their domination. The Real Audiencia of Buenos Aires decided to depose Sobremonte from his role as viceroy, confirmed Liniers as commander-in-chief, and appointed him as interim viceroy. It was an unprecedented action. Saint Helena regiment flag (or 95th Rifle Regiment flag) captured by the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata troops during the second British invasion in 1807 and offered by viceroy Santiago de Liniers, in gratitude for the victory, to Our Lady of the Rosary at the Santo Domingo church, in C√≥rdoba, Argentina.Palombo, Guillermo. Las Banderas Brit√°nicas tomadas en Buenos Aires el 5 de Julio de 1807. (in Spanish). Second British Invasion Once the Banda Oriental had been secured, the British prepared the attack on Buenos Aires. They were aware that the city was prepared for the invasion, but the forces were greater than in the first one, 23 ships and 11,000 soldiers.De Titto, p. 42 John Whitelocke, leader of the British forces, moved to Buenos Aires next to the River. Liniers left the city to battle him, being defeated, but managed to retreat and return to Buenos Aires. √Ålzaga, assuming that Liniers had died, put his defense plans in motion, and the morale of the troops rose when Liniers returned alive.De Titto, p. 43 The British forced entered into the city and found a strong resistance, and many battalions were defeated, while others tried to resist at strategic points. Whitelocke suggested a truce, which was rejected by Liniers, who also attacked the British ships within cannon range. Whitelocke's defeat was complete, and Liniers demanded that all British forces be removed from the territories of Viceroyalty, including the Banda Oriental, in no more than 2 months, as well as an exchange of prisoners. Whitelocke accepted the conditions and surrendered. Government There was a large number of celebrations after the victory against the British. Liniers was officially appointed as viceroy in May 1808, and awarded the title of \\"Count of Buenos Aires\\". However, this victory of the Argentine people which was obtained without any military help from Spain led to a new political situation in which some will for independence started to emerge. In this configuration, Liniers who appeared to be a fantastic leader during the emergency crisis began to be criticized by the different parties including the conservative members of the Cabildo, led by √Ålzaga. On one side, Spanish leaders criticized the new power of the Argentine people issued from the formation of criollo armies, and thought that Spanish influence was in danger. On the opposite side, criollo people who were asking for more independence, had some difficulty understanding the perfect sense of loyalty of a navy officer issued from old French nobility who intended to respect his oath to the king of Spain.de Titto, p. 45 In this context, every action coming from Liniers became a source of criticism. As an example, his relation with Ana P√©richon \\"la pericona\\" was severely pointed out, forcing him to lock her at her home and later to deport her to colonial Brazil. In the same spirit, his French birth became highly controversial when France invaded Spain, and started the Peninsular War, which included the removal of the Spanish king and queen by the French occupying forces. Despite the clear statements by Liniers of remaining loyal to the Spanish Empire and his refusal to accept Joseph Bonaparte as king, his political enemies created rumours that he was plotting to accept Bonaparte. They also promoted in the R√≠o de la Plata the xenophobia that was taking place in Spain against the French, as an indirect means to attack Liniers and lower his prestige. The arrival of Sassenay, an agent of Napoleon seeking recognition for Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain, boosted rumors and controversy. Liniers house in Buenos Aires The criollo peoples promoted the Carlotist project, which tried to crown Charlotte of Spain, sister of Ferdinand, as Regent of the Spanish territories in the Americas, under a Constitutional monarchy. The project did not achieve success. The news of the creation of the Junta of Seville was seen by both criollos and peninsulars as a chance to create similar governments locally, but they had different perspectives on the political line such governments should have. Javier de El√≠o, governor of Montevideo and allied with √Ålzaga, created a Junta in the city. √Ålzaga set off a mutiny to do the same in Buenos Aires, but the forces under the command of Cornelio Saavedra defeated it and kept Liniers in power. √Ålzaga was jailed and the military bodies that took part in the mutiny were dissolved, which left only military bodies loyal to the criollos. The Junta of Seville appointed a new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. Some Criollos proposed Liniers to resist the replacement with the forces under his command. It was considered that only a rightful king could appoint viceroys, and despite the circumstances of his designation Liniers had been confirmed in office by Charles IV; whereas Cisneros, appointed just by the Junta, may have lacked such legitimacy. However, Liniers rejected the proposal, and gave up government without resistance. After leaving government, he retired from politics and moved to C√≥rdoba province, settling in the town of Alta Gracia. However, he came out of his retirement shortly after, when news of the May Revolution arrived to the province. Counterrevolution and execution Execution of Santiago de Liniers. The governor of C√≥rdoba, Juan Antonio Guti√©rrez de la Concha, called for a meeting of the social elite of C√≥rdoba, Liniers included, in order to discuss reactions towards the Primera Junta. At this time, Liniers's father- in-law, Mart√≠n de Sarratea, wrote a letter to ask him to stay away from the counterrevolution, which he refused in the name of honor and respect to his word. The C√≥rdoba Cabildo gave recognition instead to the Regency Council of C√°diz, and Cisneros secretly gave authorization to Liniers to raise the viceroyalty against the Junta.De Titto, p. 48 Liniers wrote to other Royalist leaders, trying to organize the forces to fight against Buenos Aires. The Junta decided that, among the many enemies that could threaten it, C√≥rdoba was the most dangerous, so an army led by Ortiz de Ocampo was sent to fight against it. However, there was no fighting: the counterrevolutionary army was severely damaged by espionage, desertions, and sabotage. The mere proximity of the troops from Buenos Aires caused the complete dispersion of the army gathered by Liniers. Liniers and the other top personnel of the counterrevolution tried to flee in multiple directions, but Ocampo captured them all. Ocampo refused to execute the prisoners, aware of their popularity, so he delivered them to Buenos Aires as prisoners instead. The Junta feared the effect that the entry of Liniers into the city might have, so Juan Jos√© Castelli was sent, with orders to replace Ocampo and execute the prisoners. The execution took place at Cabeza de Tigre, on the border between Santa Fe and C√≥rdoba. Legacy Museum at the former house of Liniers, at Alta Gracia, C√≥rdoba. Liniers had been recognized in life with a street of Buenos Aires named after him, after the triumph against the British Invasions. However, after the counterrevolution and the new number of heroes of the Argentine War of Independence, most names of such streets were modified in 1822, during the government of Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez. The former Liniers street consisted of the modern Defensa and Reconquista streets.Balmaceda, p. 267 The higher recognition to the heroes of the War of Independence stayed, but Liniers got renewed recognition with time. The Buenos Aires neighborhood of Liniers is named after him, as well as the Santiago de Liniers municipality in the Misiones Province. In 1861, Queen Isabella II of Spain formally requested Liniers's body from the Argentine Government. The remains were brought back to Spain and solemnly buried in the Pante√≥n de Marinos Ilustres of the island of San Fernando, C√°diz. At this time, Liniers's descendants received the hereditary title of \\"Conde de la Lealtad\\" (Count of Loyalty). His house at Alta Gracia was abandoned after his death, and bought in 1820 by Jos√© Manuel Solares. His family kept it for a long time, until it was expropriated in 1969 and turned into a museum in 1977.

He was the second son of King Sukjong. His mother was Consort Suk of the Choi clan. Before ascending to power, he held the title of Prince Yeoning. In 1720, a few months after the accession of his older brother, King Gyeongjong as the 20th King, Yeoning became the Royal Prince Successor Brother (wangseje, ÏôïÏÑ∏Ï†ú). This induced a large controversy between political factions. Nevertheless, four years later, at the death of Gyeongjong, Yeongjo ascended the throne. Yeongjo's reign lasted nearly 52 years and was marked by his persistent efforts to reform the taxation system of Joseon, rule by Confucian ethics, minimize and reconcile the factional fighting under his \\"Magnificent Harmony\\" Policy (Tangpyeong, Ëï©Âπ≥, ÌÉïÌèâ). His reign was also marked by the highly controversial execution of his son, Prince Sado, in 1762. In spite of the controversies, Yeongjo's reign has earned a positive reputation in Korean history due to his sincere efforts to rule by Confucian virtue. Biography Succession to the throne In 1720, his father King Sukjong died and Crown Prince Yi Yun, Sukjong's eldest son, ascended to the throne as King Gyeongjong, at the age of 33. When Sukjong died in 1720, he supposedly told Yi Yi-myoung to name Yeoning-gun as Gyeongjong's heir, but in the absence of a historiographer or scribe, there was no record . During his time there was infighting and resentment for his low-born origins. The Noron faction (ÎÖ∏Î°†, ËÄÅË´ñ) of the bureaucracy pressured King Gyeongjong to step down in favor of his half-brother Prince Yeoning (the future King Yeongjo). In 1720, two months after the King's enthronement, Prince Yeoning was installed as Royal Prince Successor Brother (wangseje, ÏôïÏÑ∏Ï†ú, Áéã‰∏ñÂºü). This aggravated the power struggle and led to a great massacre, namely the Shinim literati purges (Ïã†ÏûÑÏÇ¨Ìôî, ËæõÂ£¨Â£´Á¶ç). The Norons sent messages to the king to no effect while the opposing Soron faction (ÏÜåÎ°†, Â∞ëË´ñ) used this to their advantage ‚Äì claiming the Noron were trying to usurp power and subsequently getting their rival faction removed from several offices. Members of the Soron faction then came up with an idea to assassinate the heir (Yeoning-gun) under the pretence of hunting for a white fox said to be haunting the palace, but Yeoning-gun sought shelter with his stepmother, Queen Dowager Inwon, who protected him and he was able to stay alive. Afterwards, he told his half-brother the king that he rather would go and live as a commoner. On 11 October 1724, King Gyeongjong died. Soron then accused Prince Yeoning of having something to do with his brother's death due to the earlier attempt by the Noron faction to have him replace Gyeongjong on the throne. But historians now agree that he could have died of eating contaminated seafood, as to the symptoms of the illness that caused his death. Homer Hulbert described this in his book The History of Korea where he said, \\"But we may well doubt the truth of the rumor, for nothing that is told of that brother indicates that he would commit such an act, and in the second place a man who will eat shrimps in mid-summer, that have been brought 30 miles from the sea without ice might expect to die.\\" On 16 October 1724, Prince Yeoning ascended the throne as King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of Joseon. Reign King Yeongjo was a deeply Confucian monarch, and is said to have had a greater knowledge of the classics than his officials. During the reign of Yeongjo and his grandson Jeongjo, Confucianization was at its height, as well as the economic recovery from the wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. His rulership has been called one of the most brilliant reigns of all the Joseon Dynasty. Yeongjo worried deeply for his people. Annals of the Joseon Dynasty record that one day in the 4th year of his reign, King Yeongjo woke up to the sound of early morning rain and said to his courtiers, > Oh dear! We have had flood, drought and famines for the past four years > because of my lack of virtue, and this year we even went through an > unprecedented revolt by a traitor named Yi In-jwa. How can my poor people > manage their livelihood under such hardship? There is an old saying, 'War is > always followed by a lean year.' Fortunately, however, we haven‚Äôt had a big > famine for the past two years and we pin our hopes on a good harvest this > year. Yet I am still nervous because, while the season for harvesting is > around the corner, there is no way of knowing if there will be a flood or > drought before then. Nobody knows whether a cold rain will pour suddenly and > flood the fields awaiting harvest. My lack of goodness might bring upon us > such awful things as I fail to win the sympathy of heaven. How can I earn > the sympathy of heavens if I do not self-reflect and make efforts myself? I > should start with reflecting on myself.The Annals of Yeongjo dated July 27 > of the 4th year of his reign 1728 Yeongjo worried that rain would ruin the harvest forcing his unfortunate people to starve. The King ordered his courtiers to reduce taxes on the people and decrease the number of dishes in his own meals. Reducing the range of foods he ate was a decision made out of concern for his starving people. One early morning 25 years later circa 1753, the continuous rain reminded Yeongjo of the flood during the 4th year of his reign, when he had eaten less food: \\"Oh! Floods and droughts really happen because I lack virtue. I am much older than that year, but how can my compassion for the people and will to work hard for them be less than back then?\\".The Annals of Yeongjo, dated July 23 of the 29th year of his reign circa 1753 Yet again, Yeongjo ordered a reduction in the number of dishes on his dining table. People around him described him as an articulate, bright, benevolent and kind King. He was penetrating in observation and quick of comprehension.The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyong Pag. p.250 Policies Yeongjo realising the detrimental effect on state administration of factional strife during the latter half of the 17th century, attempted to end factional strife as soon as he ascended the throne. Yeongjo reinstated the short-lived universal military service tax, then he even went beyond the palace gate and solicited the opinion of officials, literati (scholars), soldiers and peasants. Yeongjo reduced the military service tax by half and ordered the variance be supplemented by taxes on fisheries, salt, vessels and an additional land tax. Yeongjo also regularized the financial system of state revenues and expenses by adopting an accounting system. His realistic policies allowed payment of taxes on grain from the remote mountainous areas Gyeongsang do province, to the nearby port, with payment in cotton or cash for grain. The circulation of currency was encouraged by increasing coin casting. Yeongjo's concern for improvement of the peasant‚Äôs life was manifest in his eagerness to educate the people by distributing important books in the Korean script (Hangul), including the Book of Agriculture. The pluviometre was again manufactured in quantity and distributed to local administration offices and extensive public work projects were undertaken. Yeongjo upgraded the status of posterity of the commoners, opening another possibility for upward social mobility and inevitable change. Yeongjo policies were intended to reassert the Confucian monarchy and a humanistic rule, but they couldn't stem the tide of social change that resulted. Mercantile activities rapidly increased in volume. The accumulation of capital through monopoly and wholesales expanded through guild organisations and many merchants were centred in Hanyang. The traditional division of government chartered shop, the license tribute goods suppliers and the small shopkeepers in the alley and streets were integrated and woven into a monopoly and wholesale system. Regardless of status, many yangban class aristocrats and commoners engaged in some kind of merchant activities. Thus Hanyang made great strides as a commercial and industrial city in the 18th century. The popular demand for handicrafts and goods such as knives, horse hair hats, dining table and brassware was ever-increasing. Restrictions on wearing the horse hair hat originally denoting a Yangban class status, virtually disappeared Even bootlegging of books became commercialised as competition developed among the well-to-do Yanban engaged in publication of collected literary works of their renowned ancestors. This also led to printing popular fiction and poetry. The people especially appreciated satire and social criticism. One example is the Chunhyangjeon (Tales of Chunghyang) about the fidelity of the Gisaeng‚Äôs (entertainer's) daughter was widely read as a satire aimed to expose the greed and snobbery of government officials. Anti-corruption The King is also renowned for having treasured Park Mun-su, who he appointed as Amhaeng-eosa (ÏïîÌñâÏñ¥ÏÇ¨), a secret government inspector for the King. Park, who had earned great merit in putting down Yi In-jwa's rebellion in 1728, went around the nation arresting corrupt local officers in the name of the King. Controversy The only significantly dismal incident during Yeongjo's reign was the death of his son, Crown Prince Sado. History indicates Sado suffered from mental illness; randomly killing people in the palace and raping palace maids. By court rules King Yeongjo could not kill his son by his own hands, so Sado was ordered to climb into a large wooden rice chest on a hot July day in 1762. After eight days, Sado died.The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong (ÌïúÏ§ëÎ°ù, Èñë‰∏≠ÈåÑ) During the 19th century, there were rumors that Prince Sado had not been mentally ill, but had been victimised by a court plot; however, this is contradicted by both the memoirs written by Sado's widow and Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. As a means to preserve the legitimacy of Sado's son as his own heir, Yeongjo decreed that the boy be registered as the son of the deceased Crown Prince Hyojang and Princess Consort Hyosun. Catholicism Yeongjo was the first to take action against Roman Catholic activities in the country. By the 18th century, Catholicism was beginning to acquire a following especially in the Gangwon and Hwanghae provinces. In 1758, Yeongjo officially outlawed Catholicism as an evil practice. Death Fourteen years after Crown Prince Sado's death, Sado's son, Yeongjo's grandson Jeongjo, became king. The early part of the new King's years were marked by political intrigues and fear of court officials who were afraid that Jeongjo would seek revenge on them for petitioning the punishment that caused the death of his father, Crown Prince Sado. Yeongjo was buried in the dynastic tombs at Donggureung. Yeongjo is buried with his second wife in the royal tomb of Wonneung (ÏõêÎ¶â, ÂÖÉÈôµ) in the city of Guri.

He was a Progressive Era intellectual who stressed material causes (such as economic profit and conflict between businessmen and farmers) and downplayed ideology and values as motivations for historical actors. He was highly influential as a director of PhD dissertations at Harvard for three decades, especially in the fields of social, women's, and immigration history. His son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. (1917‚Äì2007), also taught at Harvard and was a noted historian. Life and career Schlesinger's father, Bernhard Schlesinger, was a Prussian Jew, and his mother, Kate (n√©e Feurle), was an Austrian Catholic. The two converted to Protestantism together and emigrated to Xenia, Ohio, in 1872. He was born in Xenia, Ohio, and graduated from The Ohio State University in 1910. While a student at Ohio State, he was initiated into the Ohio Zeta chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He took his Ph.D. in history at Columbia University, where he was influenced by both Herbert L. Osgood and Charles A. Beard. He taught at Ohio State and the University of Iowa before he joined the faculty of Harvard University as a professor of history in 1924, succeeded Frederick Jackson Turner and taught at Harvard until 1954. Harvard's Schlesinger Library in women's history is named after him and his wife, Elizabeth, a noted feminist. He became an editor of the New England Quarterly in 1928. In Boston in 1929, city officials, under the leadership of James Curley, threatened to arrest Margaret Sanger if she spoke on birth control. In response, she stood on stage, silent with a gag over her mouth, while her speech was read by Schlesinger. He enjoyed strong family ties and commitment. His two sisters, Olga and Marion Etna, became schoolteachers and made it possible for their three younger brothers (George, Arthur, and Hugo) to attend college graduating in engineering, history and law. One of his sons was born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger and replaced his middle name with \\"Meier,\\" adding Jr., later in life. Schlesinger died at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Ideas He pioneered social history and urban history. He was a Progressive Era intellectual who stressed material causes (like economic profit) and downplayed ideology and values as motivations for historical actors. He was highly influential as a director of PhD dissertations at Harvard for three decades, especially in the fields of social, women's, and immigration history. He commented in 1922, \\"From reading history in textbooks one would think half of our population made only a negligible contribution to history.\\" He promoted social history by co-editing the 13-volume History of American Life (1928‚Äì1943) series with Dixon Ryan Fox. These thick volumes, written by leading young scholars, mostly avoid politics, individuals, and constitutional issues. They instead focus on such topics as society, demographics, economic, housing, fashion, sports, education, and cultural life. In \\"Tides of American Politics,\\" a provocative essay in the Yale Review in 1939, he presented his cyclical view of history which identified irregular oscillations between liberal and conservative national moods, but it attracted few historians apart from his son. Schlesinger introduced the idea of polling historians to rank presidential greatness, which attracted much attention. In an essay on \\"The Significance of Jacksonian Democracy\\" (in New Viewpoints in American History (1922)), Schlesinger drew attention to the fact that \\"while democracy was working out its destiny in the forests of the Mississippi Valley, the men left behind in the eastern cities were engaging in a struggle to establish conditions of equality and social well-being adapted to their special circumstances.\\" As a historian of the rise of the city in American life, he argued that for a full understanding of the Jacksonian democratic movement: \\"It is necessary to consider the changed circumstances of life of the common man in the new industrial centers of the East since the opening years of the nineteenth century.\\" That was a challenge to the frontier thesis of his Harvard colleague Frederick Jackson Turner. In Schlesinger's essay, the common man of the Mississippi Valley and the common man of eastern industrialism stood uneasily side by side. Schlesinger characterized prejudice against Catholics as \\"the deepest bias in the history of the American people\\". Schlesinger and his students took a group approach to history, sharply downplaying the role of individuals. Groups were defined by ethnicity (Germans, Irish, Jews, Italians, Hispanics, etc.) or by class (working class, middle class). Their model was that the urban environment, including the interaction with other groups, shaped their history and group outlook in deterministic fashion.

History The Guild developed as an offshoot of the Federation of Family History Societies. The FFHS was founded on 8 June 1974. By 1977 one-third of the members of the FFHS were one-name societies, and a sub-committee was set up to address the needs of this group. Among its duties was the generation of a Register of Surnames which were being comprehensively studied. The first one-name conference was held at the Grand Hotel in Leicester from 13 to 14 May 1978. Sixty-six participants attended the inaugural conference. A formal resolution was carried unanimously to establish a Guild of individuals engaged in one-name research. The Guild was officially launched in Plymouth, Devon, on 1 September 1979 during a conference hosted by the family history societies of Devon and Cornwall. Within a few months, approximately 200 members had enrolled in the Guild. To qualify for registration, one needed to have a significant body of data relating to the given surname and its variants. It was suggested that entries be extracted from current telephone directories, civil registration indexes of births, marriages and deaths, and national probate indexes such as the Prerogative Courts of Canterbury and York. Derek Palgrave. History and development of the Guild from its early days. Journal of One-Name Studies, Volume 8, Issue 8, October-December 2004. The decision to call it a guild was partly inspired by the notion that medieval guilds had encouraged professionalism along with mutual aid, as well as by a whimsical desire to create the acronym GOONS, evoking a popular British radio humorous show, The Goon Show, and making a self-mocking comment on the quixotic nature of one-name studies. As a small organisation, the Guild has no employed staff. It has co-operated closely with the Halsted Trust, created by legacy, which promotes one-name studies. While one-name studies have mainly been popular in Britain, thanks to that country's unified and open vital records, the Guild has always officially insisted that every study it recognises should be worldwide in scope, and has sought to cater for non-British studies in its basic methodological advice. One-name studies A one-name study is a project researching all occurrences of a surname, as opposed to a particular pedigree (ancestors of one person) or descendancy (descendants of one person or couple). Some \\"one-namers\\" may restrict their research geographically, perhaps to one country, but to register a surname with the Guild a member must commit to researching on a world-wide basis. Typically, the researchers will also study the etymology of the surname, and its geographical distribution. Sometimes, especially if the surname is also a place name, they will try to identify the place or places of origin of the surname, employing the normal methods of genealogy. A small core of Guild members are combining their traditional documentary research with a DNA project. By the end of 2009 some 200 DNA surname projects were led by Guild members. One-name study researchers are also increasingly making use of online networking services such as Facebook to make connections with other people researching their surname.Howard Wolinksy. Electric connections. Ancestry magazine, 27 January 2010. Activities The principal meeting places of the Guild are its on-line mailing list - the Guild Email Forum, an active Members only Facebook Group and its Seminars and Annual Conferences, which are mostly held in England. There is also a Facebook page which non- members can view and contact the Guild. As an organisation, its principal role has been to debate and distribute advice on methods for one-name studies. Members have collated a wiki of such advice, but this is not yet publicly available. To meet the concern of members that one-name compilations are often lost to posterity when researchers die and their papers are destroyed, the Guild Archive, an electronic repository for members' one-name records, has been created and guidelines laid down on bequests of digital data to the Guild. The Guild Marriage Index, a facility to help members find the names of marriage partners and identify from index numbers where post-1837 marriages took place in England and Wales, is likely to become the Guild's main contribution to the wider field of family history. Publications The Guild's initial periodical was the Guild of One-Name Studies Newsletter, published quarterly for eight issues from January 1980 to October 1981 on corner-stapled, typescript foolscap sheets under editor Frank Higenbottam.Palgrave, Derek, 'Before the Journal -- Looking back to the Guild‚Äôs early days and its first Newsletter', Journal of One-Name Studies, October‚ÄìDecember 2006. This was followed by the Journal of One-Name Studies, with binding, also quarterly, from 1982 to the present. Its current editor (2016-) is Jean-Marc Bazzoni.The Register of One-Name Studies published annually, lists all one-name studies currently registered by Guild members. The Guild also publishes booklets of advice such as Organising a One-Name Gathering. The Guild published Your Research Surname Guide - How to do a One- Name Study with the April 2019 edition of Family Tree Magazine (UK). In September 2019, the Guild published a revised and extended edition, called Researching Surnames - A Guide to One-Name Studies, both of these guides were written by Julie Goucher. Membership Membership of the Guild is open to anyone interested in one-name studies. Members may register their one-name study surnames with the Guild if they wish, provided those surnames are not currently registered. However registration of a surname is not a condition of membership. At its foundation, the Guild had about 200 members. At present (2019), it has 2725 members. Study surnames are listed in a Register published both on-line and on paper. The Register shows that slightly more than 2,000 studies are being conducted involving a total of about 8,476 surnames and variants. A considerable number of early members have retired or died, and their studies, additional to this number, have therefore ceased. Some 20 per cent of the membership present their findings through websites. Guild members can also publicise their studies through profilesA list of profiles is published in the profile section of the Guild website created on the Guild's website. As an indicator of digitised methods, 80 per cent of the members have an e-mail address registered with the Guild.Millington, Paul, 'Some Guild Stats', Rootsweb Archive 2006-10-02. The addresses of members show the bulk to be living in Britain, but with significant numbers in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

Early life Benjamin Barr Lindsey was born in Jackson, Tennessee, to former confederate captain Landy Tunstall Lindsey. He was educated in the public schools and attended Southwest Baptist University. His father committed suicide when Ben was 18, leaving him the sole support of his mother and her three younger children. He obtained employment in a real-estate office in Denver, where he studied law in his spare time. In despair over his slow progress in his law studies, he attempted suicide, but his gun misfired. In 1894, he entered the practice of law in Denver. In his work, he was often assisted by his wife, Henrietta, whom he had married in 1914. He was appointed to a vacancy in the county court in 1900. Juvenile court Lindsey and wife in 1915 Lindsey was a pioneer in the establishment of the juvenile court system. Through his efforts, an act was passed creating a juvenile court in Denver which represented an important advance in relation of the law to children and would go on to serve as a model for future juvenile courts across America. Lindsey was made judge of the juvenile court in 1901 (which became a juvenile and family relations court in 1907). He held the position continuously, but he was not endorsed by either political party in 1908. Among other measures to which Judge Lindsey contributed his influence were a reform of the registration law, greatly reducing election frauds; a reform of the ballot; state provisions for the support of the dependents of people serving in prison; extension of the probation system for prisoners; organization of public baths and playgrounds in Denver; the institution of the fresh-air movement in Denver; and enactment of statewide Mother's Pension Law. He was a leader in the movement to abolish child labor. He carried on an active propaganda for the general adoption of the juvenile court plan, and for political and social reform, through lectures delivered in many American and foreign cities and through the publication of books and pamphlets, of which The Beast (with Harvey J. O'Higgins, 1910) was widely circulated. In 1906, Judge Lindsey was a candidate for Governor of Colorado, and in 1912 became a member of the Progressive National Committee. Companionate marriage In early 1927, Judge Lindsey co-wrote a controversial book about what he called \\"companionate marriage,\\" in which he suggested that young men and women should be able to live together in a trial marriage, where the couple could have a year to evaluate whether or not they were suitable with each other. The only caveat was they had to agree not to have children. If after a year, the couple decided to stay together, they could do so, but if the relationship didn't work out, they would be able to dissolve the relationship easily. Also, if they decided they were compatible and did want children, they could change the status of their relationship to a traditionally understood marriage. Since one of the most common discourses in the popular culture was about women having children, and many clergy believed that sexual intercourse within marriage should only be for purposes of procreation, Judge Lindsey's essay aroused strong emotions; a number of priests and ministers, as well as civic leaders accused him of promoting immorality, promiscuity and free love, charges that he denied. At one point, even the Pope spoke out against him. In Denver, he was ousted from the bench, after 28 years of service. Time expressed the view that his views on companionate marriage had destroyed his reputation. Judge Lindsey continued to defend his views on radio and in a series of speaking engagements. In popular culture Judge Lindsey appeared as himself in the film The Soul of Youth (1920), directed by William Desmond Taylor, and in Judge Ben Lindsey in the Juvenile Court (1921), the latter film made in the experimental Photokinema sound-on-disc process. \\"Benjamin Barr Lindsey\\", episode 24 of the historical docudrama TV series Profiles in Courage, based upon John F. Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, was broadcast on April 25, 1965, with George Grizzard portraying Judge Lindsey in 1906, at the time of his advocacy for juvenile justice reform. He is a recurring character in the songs of Denver folk/country artist Jay Munly, appearing in songs such as \\"Circle Round My Bedside\\" and \\"Bonnie Clyde, the Big Bull-Hen of the Women's Prison\\"  Later years  In 1931, he ran for, and won election to a judgeship in the California Superior Court. He also continued his advocacy for children in the juvenile justice system. He died in Los Angeles, of a heart attack, at age 73.

After a Catholic upbringing and education in New York, Unanue served in the United States Army during World War II, and was awarded the Bronze star for bravery. He subsequently returned to New York and joined the company his father had founded, Goya Foods. He rose to become president in 1978, a position he held until 2004. Unanue was made a knight of the Order of Malta, and was awarded several honorary doctorates. He died of pulmonary fibrosis in 2013. Early years Unanue's father, Prudencio Unanue Ortiz, was born in Villasana de Mena, in the province of Burgos, in northern Spain. He emigrated to Puerto Rico, where he met a young Spanish girl by the name of Carolina Casal, whose parents also had immigrated to Puerto Rico from Galicia. They were married in the island in 1921 and soon after moved to New York City and settled in Brooklyn where Joseph Unanue was born. Prudencio Unanue worked as a broker for Spanish companies doing business in the U.S. He soon realized that there was a need for Hispanic products in New York City, and in 1936 he founded Goya Foods, a food distributing company, in Manhattan. Prudencio Unanue was very serious about his children's education and enrolled them in Catholic schools. Joseph attended St. Joseph's Grammar School and later St. Cecilia's High School. Since childhood and when not in school, Unanue and his brothers had to work in the family business. His special job was bottling olives. In 1943, he graduated from high school but, since World War II was in full swing, he was drafted into the United States Army. World War II After basic training, Unanue attended the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. However, due to the intensity of the war, he was soon sent to the battlefield. In 1944, his Army company landed in France and soon joined General George S. Patton's 3rd Army at the Battle of the Bulge. Unanue was only 19 years old and a Private First Class when his sergeant died in action. He was then named sergeant in the field and made platoon leader. Unanue pulled his men to safety and was awarded the Bronze Star for bravery. Goya Foods In 1946, after Unanue returned home, he enrolled in The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He joined the family business, together with his brothers Tony and Frank Unanue. He learned every facet of the food industry. At first, the major supermarkets, such as A&P; and Safeways weren't interested in selling anything with the Hispanic demography in mind. Eventually, with the wave of Hispanic immigrants landing in the United States, the supermarket industry started to take notice. Goya Foods started to supply Safeway's Supermarket in Harlem and the rest soon followed. In 1956, Unanue married Carmen Ana de Casal, a Puerto Rican art collector and philanthropist with whom he had six children and 16 grandchildren. In 1976, Unanue was named president of the company, whose principal base of operations was by then in New Jersey. His brother Frank ran Goya de Puerto Rico, Inc., located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Under Joseph's leadership, the company became the largest Hispanic‚Äìowned food distributor in the United States, with sales of over $800 million a year and with over 2,000 employees. Goya Foods grew to have more than a dozen facilities in the continental United States, while affiliated companies operate in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Spain. Goya Foods supports many organizations, among them the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, Repertorio Espa√±ol, Ballet Hispanico, and the Puerto Rican Day Parade. It also supports \\"The New Jersey Council for the Arts\\", El Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1985, Unanue's son Joseph F. Unanue was named Vice President of Operations, a position he held until 1998 when he died of cancer. His younger son, Andy Unanue, was named to replace Joseph F. Unanue. Later years In February 2004, after 27 years as president of Goya Foods, 78-year-old Joseph and his son Andy were ousted from the company by Joseph's two nephews. Joseph Unanue resided in Alpine, New Jersey with his wife Carmen Ana and continued to participate in civic and cultural activities. In 2008, his son Andy was briefly a candidate for the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey. He announced his candidacy on March 23, 2008, and filed petitions for the race on April 7, 2008. However, he dropped out of the race four days later, and his committee on vacancies designated former Congressman Dick Zimmer to enter the race under the Unanue petitions. He died of complications of pulmonary fibrosis in 2013. Legacy Among the many distinctions that Joseph Unanue received was being knighted by the Order of Malta. He was presented with the key to the city of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1991 he was presented with the National Hispanic Achievement Award, and was twice named the \\"Man of the Year\\" by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The National Suppliers Association presented him with the Leadership Award. Unanue received honorary doctorates from Mercy College and Long Island University in New York, and from Felician College in New Jersey. The Catholic University of America has named one of its campus houses \\"The Joseph Unanue House\\".

The United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland make a \\"European Anglosphere\\" with an area of about and a population of over 71 million. According to a survey published in 2006, 13% of EU citizens speak English as their native language. Another 38% of EU citizens state that they have sufficient skills in English to have a conversation, so the total reach of English in the EU is 51%.Europeans and their Languages (2006) European English is known by a number of colloquial portmanteau words including: Eurolish (first recorded in 1979), Eurish (1993) and Eurlish (2006).Lambert, James. 2018. A multitude of ‚Äòlishes‚Äô: The nomenclature of hybridity. English World-wide, 39(1): 24. DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam History of English English is descended from the language spoken by the Germanic tribes of the German Bight along the southern coast of the North Sea, the Angles, Saxons, Frisians and Jutes. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, around 449 AD, Vortigern, King of the Britons, issued an invitation to the \\"Angle kin\\" (Angles, led by Hengest and Horsa), to help him against the Picts. In return, the Angles were granted lands in the southeast. Further aid was sought, and in response \\"came men of Ald Seaxum of Anglum of Iotum\\" (Saxons, Angles and Jutes). The Chronicle documents the subsequent influx of settlers who eventually established seven kingdoms: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Kent, Essex, Sussex and Wessex. These Germanic invaders dominated the original Celtic-speaking inhabitants. The dialects spoken by these invaders formed what would be called Old English, which was also strongly influenced by yet another Germanic language, Old East Norse, spoken by Danish Viking invaders who settled mainly in the North-East. English, England and East Anglia are derived from words referring to the Angles: Englisc, Angelcynn and Englaland. For 300 years following the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Anglo-Norman language was the language of administration and few Kings of England spoke English. A large number of French words were assimilated into Old English, which lost most of its inflections, the result being Middle English. Around the year 1500, the Great Vowel Shift marked the transformation of Middle English into Modern English. The most famous surviving work from Old English is Beowulf, and from Middle English is Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. The rise of Modern English began around the fifteenth century, with Early Modern English reaching its literary pinnacle at the time of William Shakespeare. Some scholars divide early Modern English and late Modern English at around 1800, in concert with British conquest of much of the rest of the world, as the influence of native languages affected English enormously. Classification and related languages English belongs to the western sub-branch of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family of languages. The closest undoubted living relatives of English are Scots and the Frisian languages. West Frisian language is spoken by approximately half a million people in the Dutch province of Friesland (Frysl√¢n). Saterland Frisian language is spoken in nearby areas of Germany. North Frisian language is spoken on a few islands in the North Sea. While native English speakers are generally able to read Scots, except for the odd unfamiliar word, Frisian is largely unintelligible (though it was much closer to modern English's predecessors, Middle English and especially Old English). After Scots and Frisian, the next closest relative is modern Low German of the eastern Netherlands and northern Germany, which was the old homeland of the Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain. Other less closely related living languages include Dutch, German, and the Scandinavian languages (which do _not_ include Finnish). Many French words are also intelligible to an English speaker, as English absorbed a tremendous amount of vocabulary from the Norman language after the Norman conquest and from French in later centuries; as a result, a substantial proportion of English vocabulary is very close to the French, with some slight spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.) and some occasional lapses in meaning. English in Britain and Ireland Wales In 1282 Edward I of England defeated Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Wales's last independent prince, in battle. Edward followed the practice used by his Norman predecessors in their subjugation of the English, and constructed a series of great stone castles in order to control Wales, thus preventing further military action against England by the Welsh. With ‚ÄòEnglish‚Äô political control at this time came Anglo-Norman customs and language; English did not displace Welsh as the majority language of the Welsh people until the anti Welsh language campaigns, which began towards the end of the 19th century (54% spoke Welsh in 1891; see Welsh language). The Welsh language is currently spoken by about one-fifth of the population. It has been enjoying support from the authorities for some decades, resulting in a revival, and is in a healthy position in many parts of Wales. Ireland The second English dominion was Ireland. With the arrival of the Normans in Ireland in 1169, King Henry II of England gained Irish lands and the fealty of many native Gaelic nobles. By the 14th century, however, English rule was largely limited to the area around Dublin known as the Pale. English influence on the country waned during this period to the point that the English-dominated Parliament was driven to legislate that any Irish of English descent must speak English (requiring those that did not know English to learn it) through the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. English rule expanded in the 16th century by the Tudor conquest of Ireland, leading the Gaelic order to collapse at the start of the 17th century. The Flight of the Earls in 1607 paved the way for the Plantation of Ulster and a deepening of the English language culture in Ireland. The Cromwellian Plantation and suppression of Catholicism, including both native Irish and the \\"Old English\\" (those of Anglo-Norman descent), further cemented English influence across the country. As the centuries passed and the social conditions in Ireland deteriorated, culminating in the Great Irish Famine, Irish parents didn't speak Irish to their children as they knew that the children might have to emigrate and Irish would be of no use outside the home country, in Britain, the United States, Australia or Canada. In addition, the introduction of universal state education in the national schools from 1831 proved a powerful vector for the transmission of English as a home language, with the greatest retreat of the Irish language occurring in the period between 1850 and 1900. By the 20th century, Ireland had a centuries-old history of diglossia. English was the prestige language while the Irish language was associated with poverty and disfranchisement. Accordingly, some Irish people who spoke both Irish and English refrained from speaking to their children in Irish, or, in extreme cases, feigned the inability to speak Irish themselves. Despite state support for the Irish language in the Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland) after independence, Irish continued to retreat, the economic marginality of many Irish-speaking areas (see Gaeltacht) being a primary factor. For this reason Irish is spoken as a mother tongue by only a very small number of people on the island of Ireland. Irish has been a compulsory subject in schools in the Republic since the 1920s and proficiency in Irish was until the mid-1980s required for all government jobs. It may be noted, however, that certain words (especially those germane to political and civic life) in Irish remain features of Irish life and are rarely, if ever, translated into English. These include the names of legislative bodies (such as D√°il √âireann and Seanad √âireann), government positions such as Taoiseach and T√°naiste, of the elected representative(s) in the D√°il (Teachta D√°la), and political parties (such as Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael). Ireland's police force, the Garda S√≠och√°na, are referred to as \\"the Garda√≠\\", or \\"the Guards\\" for short. Irish appears on government forms, euro-currency, and postage stamps, in traditional music and in media promoting folk culture. Irish placenames are still common for houses, streets, villages, and geographic features, especially the thousands of townlands. But with these important exceptions, and despite the presence of Irish loan words in Hiberno-English, Ireland is today largely an English-speaking country. Fluent or native Irish speakers are a minority in the most of the country, with Irish remaining as a vernacular mainly in the relatively small Gaeltacht regions, and most Irish speakers also have fluent English. Northern Ireland At the time of partition, English had become the first language of the vast majority in Northern Ireland. It had small elderly Irish-speaking populations in the Sperrin Mountains as well as in the northern Glens of Antrim and Rathlin Island. There were also pockets of Irish speakers in the southernmost part of County Armagh. All of these Irish speakers were bilingual and chose to speak English to their children, and thus these areas of Northern Ireland are now entirely English-speaking. However, in the 2000s a Gaeltacht Quarter was established in Belfast to drive inward investment as a response to a notable level of public interest in learning Irish and the expansion of Irish-medium education (predominantly attended by children whose home language is English) since the 1970s. In recent decades, some Nationalists in Northern Ireland have used it as a means of promoting an Irish identity. However, the amount of interest from Unionists remains low, particularly since the 1960s. About 165,000 people in Northern Ireland have some knowledge of Irish. Ability varies; 64,847 people stated they could understand, speak, read and write Irish in the 2011 UK census, the majority of whom have learnt it as a second language. Otherwise, except for place names and folk music, English is effectively the sole language of Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement specifically acknowledges the position both of Irish and of Ulster Scots in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland. Scotland Anglic speakers were actually established in Lothian by the 7th century, but remained confined there, and indeed contracted slightly to the advance of the Gaelic language. However, during the 12th and 13th centuries, Norman landowners and their retainers, were invited to settle by the king. It is probable that many of their retainers spoke a northern form of Middle English, although probably French was more common. Most of the evidence suggests that English spread into Scotland via the burgh, proto-urban institutions which were first established by King David I. Incoming burghers were mainly English (especially from Northumbria, and the Earldom of Huntingdon), Flemish and French. Although the military aristocracy employed French and Gaelic, these small urban communities appear to have been using English as something more than a lingua franca by the end of the 13th century. English appeared in Scotland for the first time in literary form in the mid-14th century, when its form unsurprisingly differed little from other northern English dialects. As a consequence of the outcome of the Wars of Independence though, the English of Lothian who lived under the King of Scots had to accept Scottish identity. The growth in prestige of English in the 14th century, and the complementary decline of French in Scotland, made English the prestige language of most of eastern Scotland. Thus, from the end of the 14th century, and certainly by the end of the 15th century, Scotland began to show a split into two cultural areasthe mainly English or Scots Lowlands, and the mainly Gaelic-speaking Highlands (which then could be thought to include Galloway and Carrick; see Galwegian Gaelic). This caused divisions in the country where the Lowlands remained, historically, more influenced by the English to the south: the Lowlands lay more open to attack by invading armies from the south and absorbed English influence through their proximity to and their trading relations with their southern neighbours. In 1603 the Scottish King James VI inherited the throne of England, and became James I of England. James moved to London and only returned once to Scotland. By the time of James VI's accession to the English throne the old Scottish Court and Parliament spoke Scots. Scots developed from the Anglian spoken in the Northumbrian kingdom of Bernicia, which in the 6th century conquered the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and renamed its capital of Din Eidyn to Edinburgh (see the etymology of Edinburgh). Scots continues to heavily influence the spoken English of the Scottish people today. It is much more similar to dialects in the north of England than to 'British' English, even today. The introduction of King James Version of the Bible into Scottish churches also was a blow to the Scots language, since it used Southern English forms. In 1707 the Scottish and English Parliaments signed a Treaty of Union. Implementing the treaty involved dissolving both the English and the Scottish Parliaments, and transferring all their powers to a new Parliament in London which then became the British Parliament. A customs and currency union also took place. With this, Scotland's position was consolidated within the United Kingdom. Today, almost all residents of Scotland speak English, although many speak various dialects of Scots which differ markedly from Scottish Standard English. Approximately 2% of the population use Scottish Gaelic as their language of everyday use, primarily in the northern and western regions of the country. Virtually all Scottish Gaelic speakers also speak fluent English. Isle of Man The Isle of Man is a Crown Dependency. English and Manx Gaelic are the two official languages. Because so few speak Manx as a first language, all inhabitants of the Isle of Man speak English. English in other British or formerly British territories Channel Islands The bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are two Crown Dependencies. Besides English, some (very few) inhabitants of these islands speak regional languages, or those related to French (such as J√®rriais, Dg√®rn√©siais and Sercquiais). All inhabitants of the Channel Islands speak English. Gibraltar Gibraltar has been a British overseas territory since an Anglo-Dutch force led by Sir George Rooke seized \\"The Rock\\" in 1704 and Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to Great Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The territory's Gibraltarian inhabitants have a rich cultural heritage as a result of the mix of the neighbouring Andalusian population with immigrants from Great Britain, Genoa, Malta, Portugal, Morocco and India. The vernacular language of the territory is Llanito. It consists of an eclectic mix of Andalusian Spanish and British English as well as languages such as Maltese, Portuguese, Italian of the Genoese variety and Haketia. Even though Andalusian Spanish is the main constituent of Llanito, it is also heavily influenced by British English, involving a certain amount of code-switching into English. However, English remains the sole official language, used by Government. It is also the medium of instruction in schools and most Gibraltarians who go on to tertiary education do so in the UK. Although Gibraltar receives Spanish television and radio, British television is also widely available via satellite. Whereas a century ago, most Gibraltarians were monolingual Spanish speakers, the majority is now naturally bilingual in English and Spanish. Menorca Like Gibraltar, Menorca was ceded to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht, although as it transpired this was to be a temporary dominion. Nevertheless, while under British Control Menorca become the Royal Navy's main Mediterranean base and English has been very widely spoken throughout Menorca ever since. Although not an official language, English tends to be used on much public signage alongside Castilian Spanish and Menorcan. Cyprus In 1914 the Ottoman Empire declared war against the United Kingdom and France as part of the complex series of alliances that led to World War I. The British then annexed Cyprus on 2 November 1914 as part of the British Empire, making the Cypriots British subjects. On 5 November 1914 the British and the French declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Most of Cyprus gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, with the UK, Greece and Turkey retaining limited rights to intervene in internal affairs. Parts of the island were excluded from the territory of the new independent republic and remain under UK control. These zones are what are known as the Sovereign Base Areas or SBAs. The British colonial history of Cyprus has left Cypriots with a good level of English but it is no longer an official language in either the Greek south side of the island, formally known as the Republic of Cyprus or the Turkish north, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus though English remains official in the SBAs. Since the effective partition of the island in 1974, Greek and Turkish Cypriots have had little opportunity or inclination to learn the others' language, and are more likely to talk to each other in English. Older Turkish Cypriots who worked or lived with Greek Cypriots prior to partition often speak Greek quite fluently. Indeed, many Ottoman soldiers took Greek wives and were allowed to marry up to four.The Turnstone: A Doctor's Story page 216 English is also commonly used on Cyprus to communicate with foreign visitors. The large number of British tourists (and other, largely Northern European ones, who use English as a lingua franca) who visit Cyprus regularly has contributed largely to the continued use of English on Cyprus, especially in its thriving tourist industry. After independence in the 1960s there was some attempt to encourage French, which was still the most important European language. This policy would have been in line with that in place in Greece at the time. Furthermore, in the 1960s, affluent French-speaking tourists (both from France and Lebanon) in terms of percentage were more important than today. Overall though, the French policy was indicative of a desire to distance Cyprus from the former British colonial power, against which a bitter war of independence had recently been fought and won. However, knowledge of English is helped by the large Cypriot migrant communities in the UK and Australia, leading to diffusion of culture and language back to their country of origin, and negative sentiments towards the UK have waned or disappeared. There is now a large British expatriate population, in addition to the British military presence in the Sovereign Base Areas, as well as the UN buffer zone, whose peacekeepers usually also use English as a lingua franca. All of the above maintains an English-speaking presence on the island. Malta In 1814, Malta became part of the British Empire, under the terms of the Treaty of Vienna. Prior to the arrival of the British, the language of the educated Maltese elite had been Italian, and all legal statutes, taxation, education and clerical discourses were conducted either in Italian or in Latin. However, this was increasingly downgraded by the increased use of English. The British began scripting and codifying Maltesehitherto an unscripted vernacularas a language in or around 1868. From this point on, the Maltese language gradually gained currency as the main language on the islands, its grammars and conventions evolving in a mix between Italian, Arabic and English. Between the 1870s and 1930s, Malta had three official languages, Italian, Maltese and English, but in 1934, English and Maltese were declared the sole official languages. The British associated Italian with the Benito Mussolini regime in Italy, which had made territorial claims on the islands, although the use of Italian by nationalists was more out of cultural affinities with Italy than any sympathy with Italian Fascism. With the outbreak of World War II, the Maltese lost their sense of fraternity with the Italian world, and there was a decline in Italian spoken in Malta. English remains an official language in Malta, but since independence in 1964, the country's cultural and commercial links with Italy have strengthened, owing to proximity. Italian television is widely received in Malta and is highly popular. Other countries There are also pockets of native English speakers to be found throughout Europe, such as in southern Spain, France, Algarve in Portugal, as well as numerous US and British military bases in Germany. There are communities of native English speakers in some European cities aside from the cities of the UK and Ireland, e.g., Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Paris, Athens, Vienna, Prague, Oslo, Helsinki, Stockholm, and Rome. Sectors of tourism, publishing, finance, computers and related industries rely heavily on English due to Anglophone trade ties. Air traffic control and shipping movements are almost all conducted in English. In areas of Europe where English is not the first language, there are many examples of the mandated primacy of English: for example, in many European companies, such as Airbus, Philips, Renault, Volvo, etc. have designated English to be the language of communication for their senior management, and many universities are offering education in English. The language is also a required subject in most European countries. Thus, the percentage of English speakers is expected to rise.

English has become the most useful language to connect different language groups in Europe. The impact of Brexit on EU language policy remains to be seen, but it is possible that the EU, in retaining English as a key working language without the dominant presence of British English speakers, would claim ownership over its own dialect of English and develop it for its own needs.English in a post-Brexit European Union by Marko Modiano, World Englishes 19 September 2017 References Category:English language Category:Languages of Europe Category:History of the English language ","title":"English language in Europe"},{"id":"1120029","text":"Asterix in Britain (, \\"Asterix in the land of the Britons\\") is the eighth in the Asterix comic book series. It was published in serial form in Pilote magazine, issues 307‚Äì334, in 1965, and in album form in 1966. It tells the story of Asterix and Obelix's journey to Roman-occupied Britain. Synopsis Julius Caesar has invaded Britain and succeeded in his conquest; but a single gaulish village in Kent remains independent. One member of the village, Anticlimax, is dispatched to Gaulish village to enlist the help of Getafix the druid in providing magic potion for the British rebels. It is decided that Asterix (Anticlimax's first cousin once removed) and Obelix should accompany him, to help transport a barrel of the potion; but while beating up a Roman galley in the English Channel, Obelix mentions the mission, which is reported to the Roman high command in Britain. In Britain, the barrel containing the potion is confiscated from a pub cellar owned by Dipsomaniax, along with all the barreled \\"warm beer\\" (bitter) and wine in Londinium, by the Romans, who set about tasting the barrels to find the right one. Soon the whole unit assigned to the testing is hopelessly drunk; whereupon Asterix and Obelix steal all the barrels labelled with Dipsomaniax's name, but Obelix is himself drunk and starts a fight with some passing Roman soldiers. During the commotion a thief steals the cart with the barrels. Anticlimax and Asterix leave Obelix at Dipsomaniax's pub to sleep off his hangover; but while Anticlimax and Asterix go in search of the thief, the Romans capture the sleeping Obelix and Dipsomaniax, and raze the pub. In the Tower of Londinium, Obelix wakes up and frees himself and Dipsomaniax out of the jail, and the three heroes, after a search, find the potion in use as a pick-me-up for a rugby team. After this team wins their game, the protagonists seize the potion and escape on the river Thames, where the Romans destroy the barrel and release the potion into the water. At the independent village, Asterix eases the Britons' disappointment by feigning to remake the potion, with herbs Asterix got from Getafix (later revealed to be tea). With a psychological boost, the village prevails against the Romans, and Asterix and Obelix return home to celebrate. Notes *In both the book and the cartoon, the blue and white uniforms of the Camulodunum team are identical to the modern home kit of Colchester United FC.Asterix in Britain cartoon on IMDB *The chief of Anticlimax's tribe, Mykingdomforanos (a pun on \\"my kingdom for a horse\\"; in French his name is Zebigbos, a pun on \\"the big boss\\"), is a caricature of Winston Churchill. The Beatles also make a cameo appearance as bards. * Although many books in the series deal with other European peoples, Britain is one of only two where the book starts with a note from the authors that they are not looking to insult their famous rivals (the English) but to merely make fun of the common stereotypes. The other book given similar treatment is Corsica. *In Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge's English translation, the linguistic difference between the Gauls and the Britons is shown by some of the Britons (especially Anticlimax) talking exclusively in stereotypical \\"upper class\\" English, including expression such as \\"This is a jolly rum thing, eh, what?\\" and \\"I say, rather, old fruit\\". In particular, Anticlimax's frequent use of \\"what?\\" makes Obelix ask \\"What do you keep on saying what for?\\" to which Anticlimax humorously replies \\"don't you know what's what, what?\\" *Anticlimax mentions that the Britons were working on a tunnel under the English Channel. The Channel Tunnel was completed in 1994, 28 years after the book was published. *The city of Londinium was not founded until around 47 CE, about a century after the comic is set. Adaptations *The book was adapted into an animated film of the same name, which was released in 1986. The adaptation is similar to the book (the main difference being that Dogmatix accompanies his master to Britain).Asterix in Britain on IMDB *A second, live- action film was released in 2012. Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia follows the plot of the book, but makes several changes: Chief Mykingdomforanos is replaced by the Queen of England and Anticlimax's tribe are represented as Scots in tartan kilts. The story is combined with elements of Asterix and the Normans ‚Äì not least in that Vitalstatistix's nephew Justforkix accompanies Asterix and Obelix to Britain.Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia * An audiobook of Asterix in Britain adapted by Anthea Bell and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on EMI Records Listen for Pleasure label in 1987.

An illuminated scroll, probably of the 10th century, created in the Byzantine empire. Scroll of the Book of Esther, Seville, Spain. Ingredients used in making ink for Hebrew scrolls today. A scroll (from the Old French escroe or escroue), also known as a roll, is a roll of papyrus, parchment, or paper containing writing.Beal, Peter. (2008) \\"scroll\\" in A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450‚Äì2000 Online edition. Oxford University Press, 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 21 November 2013. Structure A scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of writing material. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction (boustrophedon). History of scroll use Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean ancient Egyptian civilizations. Parchment scrolls were used by the Israelites among others before the codex or bound book with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD. Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times, where they were usually written in single latitudinal column. The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls. Rolls Acts of Parliament held in the Parliamentary Archives, Palace of Westminster, London Shorter pieces of parchment or paper are called rolls or rotuli, although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use roll instead of scroll. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for manuscript administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60 cm or two feet wide. Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves. A special Chinese form of short book, called the \\"whirlwind book,\\" consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up. Scotland In Scotland, the term scrow was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (Rotulorum Clericus) meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.Beal, 2008, \\"scrow\\". Replacement by the codex The codex form of the book‚Äîthat is, folding a scroll into pages, which made reading and handling the document much easier‚Äîappears during the Roman period. Stemming from a passage in Suetonius' Divus Julius (56.6), legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. But the precise meaning of passage is by no means clear. As C. H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat point out, the idea that \\"Julius Caesar may have been the inventor of the codex... is indeed a fascinating proposition; but in view of the uncertainties surrounding the passage, it is doubtful whether any such conclusion can be drawn\\". What the evidence of surviving early codices does make clear is that Christians were among the earliest to make widespread use of the codex. Several Christian papyrus codices known to us date from the second century, including at least one generally accepted as being no later than A.D. 150. \\"All in all, it is impossible to believe that the Christian adoption of the codex can have taken place any later than circa A.D. 100 (it may, of course, have been earlier)\\". There were certainly practical reasons for the change. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used. Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or \\"leaves,\\" and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. Codex is Latin for a \\"block of wood\\": the Latin liber, the root of \\"library,\\" and the German Buch, the source of \\"book,\\" both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book's title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection. The term codex technically refers only to manuscript books-those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages. From the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.Murray, Stuart A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL. Skyhorse Publishing. (p.27) Recent Torah scroll discovery The oldest complete Torah scroll was discovered stored in an academic library in Bologna, Italy, by Professor Mauro Perani in 2013. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century, but Perani suspected it was actually older as it was written in an earlier Babylonian script. Two tests conducted by laboratories at Italy's University of Salento and at the University of Illinois confirmed that the scroll dates from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Ancient Torah scrolls are rare because when they are damaged they stop being used for liturgies and are buried. The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide.Oldest complete scroll of Torah found in Italy . (2013).

Early life Thomas Hardy was born on 3 March 1752 in Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland, the son of a merchant seaman. His father died in 1760 at sea while Thomas was still a boy. He was sent to school by his maternal grandfather and later apprenticed to a shoemaker in Stirlingshire. He later worked in the Carron Iron Works. As a young man, arrived in London just before the American Revolutionary War. On 21 May 1781 he was married at St-Martin-in-the-Fields church to Lydia Priest, the youngest daughter of a carpenter and builder from Chesham, Buckinghamshire. The couple had six children, all of whom died in infancy. Lydia died in childbirth on 27 August 1794, her child (the sixth) being stillborn: the cause may have been the injuries she had sustained when a loyalist \\"Church and King\\" mob attacked the Hardy home some weeks earlier. In 1791, Hardy opened his own boot and shoe shop at 9 Piccadilly, London. Involvement with the London Corresponding Society Portrait of Hardy at the National Liberal Club Around 1792, Hardy founded the London Corresponding Society, starting out with just nine friends. However, they were soon joined by others, including Olaudah Equiano. Two years later, on 12 May 1794, it had grown so powerful that he was arrested by the King's Messenger, two Bow Street Runners, the private secretary to Home Secretary Dundas, and others on Crown charges of high treason. It was during his imprisonment that Hardy's wife died, leaving him with an unfinished letter declaring her love for him. The charges were prosecuted with Sir John Scott leading for the Crown, and William Garrow among the prosecuting counsel; while Hardy was defended by Thomas Erskine. He was acquitted after nine days of testimony and debate, on Guy Fawkes Day, 1794. Hardy's monument in Bunhill Fields burial ground Death and legacy In later life Hardy ceased involvement in politics, and with the assistance of friends set up a small shoe shop in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. In September 1797 he moved to a smaller establishment in Fleet Street. He died on 11 October 1832 at his home in Queen's Row, Pimlico, London. He was buried at Bunhill Fields burial ground, where a granite obelisk, designed by John Woody Papworth, was later erected in his memory.

It is located on the island's South Shore, with Tottenville to the south, Pleasant Plains to the East, Rossville to the north, and the Arthur Kill to the west. The neighborhood is represented in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli https://council.nyc.gov/district-51/ and in the New York State Senate by Andrew Lanza.https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/andrew-j-lanza  History  Charleston, once a small village settled by the Androvette family in 1699, bore their name as Androvetteville or Androvettetown through the 18th century. The Androvettes engaged in farming and in approximately 1850, eight of the twenty-nine structures in the village belonged to the Androvette family. Many locals may still remember Charleston as Kreischerville. With the arrival of Balthasar Kreischer (1813‚Äì1886), a Bavarian immigrant and founder of the Kreischer Brick Manufactory, the area became known as Kreischerville as his business success imparted growth to the surrounding area. Balthasar Kreischer had three mansions built on Kreischer Hill, one of which stands to this day and is designated a historical landmark. The remaining Kreischer House at 4500 Arthur Kill Road at the intersection of Kreischer Street, was renovated by the Staten Island Land Development LLC. The mansion has a certificate of occupancy for a 70-seat restaurant that will operate at night. The factory, built in 1854, was destroyed by fire in 1877 and rebuilt. The factory finally shut its doors in 1927. The name Charleston seems to have arisen during World War I, when anti-German sentiment flourished as the United States entered the war. \\"Charleston\\" appears to have been chosen so as to name the village after Charles Kreischer, one of Balthasar Kreischer's sons. Charleston once had its own United States Post Office branch, and mail sent there bore the postal code \\"Staten Island 13, New York\\". The post office, located at 28 Androvette Street, was closed in 1949. While neighborhoods on Staten Island do not have universally agreed-upon boundaries, most observers today reckon Charleston as consisting of a triangle-shaped territory enclosed by Bloomingdale Road, the Richmond Parkway, and the Arthur Kill; this gives Charleston a slightly larger area than that which the former post office served--and by the current prevailing definition Charleston includes Sandy Ground, settled in 1833 by African Americans who had achieved freedom from slavery, most of whom came to the area from Maryland; remnants of the original settlement still exist.  Development  Recent development in the area has spawned a new shopping corridor along Veterans Road West, including Staten Island's first Target and third Home Depot, among many other stores located in Bricktown Centre at Charleston, an open-air lifestyle center.http://www.realestatesiny.com/blog/bricktown-centre-shopping-center- staten-islands-newest-large-scale-commercial-projects.html Bricktown Centre Shopping Center: Staten Island's newest large scale commercial projects A second shopping center is located along Veterans Road West. Development in that part of Charleston has continued. The Tides at Charleston, an adult community development of approximately 120 units broke ground in Summer 2007, with units available for occupancy as of early 2008. A Kresicherville Active Adult community is slated to cost $25 million and will preserve the Kreischer mansion as a central landmark for the development. Charleston is one of the most remote and sparsely populated areas within all of New York City. In addition to the Kreischer mansion and Sandy Ground, the neighborhood is also home to the Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, and the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, a closed state prison property.Annese John and Tom Wrobleski. \\"N.Y.

Even today many Charleston residents still keep horses on their property. In June 2016, a Shoprite opened on Veterans Road.https://www.silive.com/news/2016/04/new_shoprite_in_charleston_exp.html It is the only supermarket located in Charleston as of 2020. In September 2017, developers announced the construction of Riverside Galleria, a shopping mall in the southern part of Charleston being designed by Studio V Architecture. The mall would include amenities such as a waterfront park, elevated walkways, and green roofs, as well as a variety of shops that included restaurants, a \\"dine-in cinema\\", and a supermarket. However, plans for the mall were canceled in January 2019 due to community opposition. Transportation MTA Regional Bus Operations' Charleston Depot, off Arthur Kill Road, opened in January 2011. Charleston is served by the local buses along Arthur Kill Road, all of which terminate at Bricktown Mall. Charleston is also served by the local bus on Bloomingdale Road.web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/staten/s055cur.pdf The SIM26, an express bus to Manhattan, also runs along Bloomingdale Road.nymta.civicconnect.com/sites/default/files/sim026nxt.pdf New York State Route 440 and Korean War Veterans Parkway pass through Charleston.

The varieties of houses in Charleston include ranch houses, raised ranch houses, Victorian houses, detached Colonial houses, and French mansard houses. A significant number of houses in Charleston are around 70 to 80 years old and have prices ranging from $179,900 to $580,000, with the former representing the costs of a ranch house. Houses built within several years until 2002 tend to be semidetached houses within a $200,000 to $300,000 price range grouped in enclaves, or large custom detached houses with prices at or above $500,000. As of that year, some houses in the area are over 100 years old. Demographics As of 2002, many groups of people live in Charleston, including many families of Irish and Italian origin. Many residents of 19th century Charleston were Germans. In the 20th century many Hungarian immigrants settled in Charleston.  Crime  Despite having a very low crime rate along with the rest of the South Shore, Charleston was nonetheless home to two crime-related figures, one a perpetrator and the other a victim, as \\"thrill killer\\" Richard Biegenwald (who committed a 1958 murder and was subsequently convicted of another killing that took place in Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1983) was born and raised there; and in 1990, the neighborhood attracted more media attention when an anti-gay hate crime was committed there: James Zappalorti, a 45-year-old disabled veteran of the Vietnam War, was stabbed to death by two assailants, one of whom also resided in Charleston at the time. The Zappalorti murder sparked successful renewed calls for New York State to adopt enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by bias. Education The New York City Department of Education serves Charleston. As of 2002 the majority of Charleston elementary age students attend P.S. 56. Some elementary school students attend P.S 6 or P.S. 62. For grades 6 though 8, I.S. 34, Totten Intermediate School and Paulo Intermediate School, I.S. 75 serve the majority of middle school age students in Charleston.

Distributed knowledge is approximately what \\"a wise man knows\\" or what someone who has complete knowledge of what each member of the community knows knows. Distributed knowledge might also be called the aggregate knowledge of a community, as it represents all the knowledge that a community might bring to bear to solve a problem. Other related phrasings include cumulative knowledge, collective knowledge, pooled knowledge, or the wisdom of the crowd. Distributed knowledge is the union of all the knowledge of individuals in a community.  Example  The logicians Aaleyah and Isko are sitting in their dark office wondering whether or not it is raining outside. Now, none of them actually knows, but Aaleyah knows something about her friend Yu Yan, namely that Yu Yan wears her red coat only if it is raining. Isko does not know this, but he just saw Yu Yan, and noticed that she was wearing her red coat. Even though none of them knows whether or not it is raining, it is distributed knowledge amongst them that it is raining. If either one of them tells the other what they know, it will be clear to the other that it is raining. If we denote by \\\\varphi that Yu Yan wears a red coat and with \\\\varphi \\\\Rightarrow \\\\psi that if Yu Yan wears a red coat, it is raining, we have : (K_b\\\\varphi \\\\land K_a(\\\\varphi \\\\Rightarrow \\\\psi)) \\\\Rightarrow D_{a,b}\\\\psi Directly translated: Isko knows that Yu Yan wears a red coat and Aaleyah knows that if Yu Yan wears a red coat it is raining.

It's a fusion genre of popular music blending Serbian folk music with other genres such as pop, rock, electronic and some hip-hop. Background and characteristics Turbo-folk music emerged as a subculture in the countryside during the 1970s before migrating to the city in the 80s and eventually reaching further expansion in the 90s during the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, Yugoslav wars, inflation and political isolation. The term is originally coined by Montenegrin musician Rambo Amadeus jokingly referring to his own musical style. However soon critics become to refers to musical style which is mix of pop music based song with elements of electronic music, Eurodance and hip-hop or other genres not related to true Serbian traditional music. Turkish and Greek folk music have also had great influences, with often cases of plagiarism without consequences due to the political situation in Yugoslavia. Songs were primarily composed by acclaimed rock and pop musicians such as Miliƒá Vuka≈°inoviƒá, Goran Bregoviƒá and Kornelije Kovaƒç with lyrics mainly written by Marina Tucakoviƒá. Most of the tracks involve themes of love, mainly adultery and sex, then materialism, alcohol and vice. The visual image also went through changes and was heading towards MTV aesthetics. Music videos and editorials were mostly directed by former art photographer Dejan Miliƒáeviƒá, who himself stated Baroque as his main inspiration. Turbo-folk was predominantly broadcast on RTV Palma and RTV Pink. Performers and popularity The record in sales is held by Lepa Brena, who has sold over 40 million records and held some of the biggest concerts on the Balkans, making her the most successful Bosnian singer to date. Brena was also considered to be the symbol of former Yugoslavia, the country's unity and power, and after the breakup of the federation, of so-called yugo-nostalgia. At the time the only \\"rival\\" Lepa Brena had was Vesna Zmijanac. Zmijanac and Brena were considered the biggest stars in Yugoslavia. Recognised as one of the most popular Yugoslavian singers, Zmijanac was dubbed the sex-symbol, fashionista and gay icon of the eighties Ceca, arguably the most popular turbo-folk singer Among various turbo-folk singers in the nineties, arguably the biggest star of the decade was Dragana Mirkoviƒá, who has sold more than 10 million records. She was at the time signed to Ju≈æni Vetar, alongside other popular singers like Mile Kitiƒá, Sinan Sakiƒá and ≈†emsa Suljakoviƒá. Arguably one of the most famous Ex-Yugoslavian artists, Zorica Brunclik is known for her singing voice, fashion style and bright pink hair. Sometimes she and folk singer Sne≈æana ƒêuri≈°iƒá are labeled as the queens of new folk music. However, Svetlana Ceca Ra≈ænatoviƒá and Aca Lukas dominated in the late nineties and early two thousands acquiring enormous popularity despite their controversies. Ceca was married to ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá Arkan, war criminal and commander of the Serb Volunteer Guard, while Lukas is known for his troublesome lifestyle involving drug addictions and gambling problems. Both singers were arrested during the operation Sablja in 2003. Nevertheless, today they are both considered as the biggest stars on the Balkans. Because of her popularity, Ceca is considered as the \\"Serbian mother\\". She also holds the record for the biggest concert made by a Serbian singer. Her concert U≈°ƒáe 2013 was attended by more than 150 000 people. Jelena Karleu≈°a also rose to prominence in the mid nineties, recognized for her highly sexual image and provocative work. During this period, Croatia also had their own pop-folk stars like Severina and Magazin with its lead singer Jelena Rozga. In the 2000s, the single-person dominated scene was replaced by diverse performers who remained popular for at least a year. New music and its performers were labeled as pop-folk performers. Serbian record label Grand Production signed almost every singer in the country, taking monopoly over the music industry with significant media space for its TV shows, music festivals and magazines. Grand was held responsible for the success of the most of, at the time, popular acts like Seka Aleksiƒá, Indira Radiƒá, Sa≈°a Matiƒá, Goga Sekuliƒá, Stoja, Dara Bubamara, Aco Pejoviƒá, Viki Miljkoviƒá, Sanja ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Jana, Dejan Matiƒá and many more. At the beginning of the 2000s popular singers Viki Miljkoviƒá and Indira Radiƒá became one of the biggest stars in the country. In 2006 Indira Radiƒá received the award for the largest number of concerts held. In 2005 with her album Mahi, mahi Viki Miljkoviƒá became one of the most successful and popular singers at the time. Every single song on her album became an enormous hit throughout the Balkans. Popular reality singing competition Zvezde Granda also created many raising stars of pop-folk, such as Milica Todoroviƒá, Tanja Saviƒá, Milan Stankoviƒá, Rada Manojloviƒá and Milica Pavloviƒá, whose careers were managed by Grand. The stars that emerged in later seasons were Aleksandra Prijoviƒá, Katarina Grujiƒá and Andreana ƒåekiƒá. Pop-folk is a music genre dominated by Ana Bekuta and Neda Ukraden. Both of them are hugely popular with their careers lasting for decades. Ana Bekuta is a big star in Serbia, while Neda Ukraden is more successful on the Balkan music scene. In the 2010s, pop- folk embraced even more pop influence and would often infuse electronic or hip-hop, leaning toward club music. Previously an underground hip-hop duo, Elitni Odredi gained enormous popularity after they had commercialized their sound by adding folk music. They were the pioneers of digital age in Serbian music, avoiding mainstream media, while using YouTube as their main platform. Bosnian singer Maya Beroviƒá, who saw moderate success in the 2000s, reached the zenith of her career when she collaborated with rappers Jala Brat and Buba Corelli on her 2017 album Viktorijina tajna, which was a mixture of contemporary R&B; and pop-folk. Criticism Ceca turbofolk music in Imotski, Croatia: \\"Turn off all the 'Cecas'/Light up the candles/Vukovar will never/Be forgotten\\" (with stylized letter U, like a fascist movement Usta≈°e) Although very popular, turbo-folk is described as pseudo-folklore, while often linking it to Serbian involvement in Bosnian and Croatian conflicts during the nineties. This left-wing section of Serbian and Croatian society explicitly viewed this music as vulgar, almost pornographic kitsch, glorifying crime, moral corruption and nationalist xenophobia. In addition to making a connection between turbofolk and \\"war profiteering, crime & weapons cult, rule of force and violence\\", in her book Smrtonosni sjaj (Deadly Splendor) Belgrade media theorist Ivana Kronja refers to its look as \\"aggressive, sadistic and pornographically eroticised iconography\\". Along the same lines, British culture theorist Alexei Monroe calls the phenomenon \\"porno-nationalism\\". However, turbo-folk was equally popular amongst the South Slavic nations during the brutal wars of the 1990s, reflecting perhaps the common cultural sentiments of the warring sides. The resilience of a turbo-folk culture and musical genre, often referred to as the \\"soundtrack to Serbia‚Äôs wars\\", was and to a certain extent still is, actively promoted and exploited by pro- government commercial TV stations, most notably on Pink and Palma TV-channels, which devote significant amount of their broadcasting schedule to turbo-folk shows and music videos. Others, however, feel that this neglects the specific social and political context that brought about turbo-folk, which was, they say, entirely different from the context of contemporary western popular culture. In their opinion, turbo-folk served as a dominant paradigm of the \\"militant nationalist\\" regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, \\"fully controlled by regime media managers\\". John Fiske feels that during that period, turbo-folk and its close counterpart Serbian eurodance had the monopoly over the officially permitted popular culture, while, according to him, in contrast, Western mass media culture of the time provided a variety of music genre, youth styles, and consequently ideological positions.John Fiske, Television Culture, February 1988, See also *Music of Serbia *Balkan ballad *Chalga *Manele *Arabesk music *Disco polo *La√Øk√≥ *Eurodance *Remove Kebab Notes References   Sabina Mihelj, \\"The Media and the Symbolic Geographies of Europe: The Case of Yugoslavia\\", 2007. * William Uricchio, We Europeans?: media, representations, identities, Intellect Books, 2008, p. 168-9 External links * Balkania Fanzine - Turbo-Folk and Balkan Music Video Culture Blog *www.brigada.nl - CHALGA - TURBOFOLK musicvideos and mp3 * Report about turbo- folk, ceca and politics *Muzika u vestima dana Category:Serbian styles of music Category:Serbian music Category:Pop music genres Category:Balkan music ","title":"Turbo-folk"},{"id":"1120089","text":"Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham (20 February 1923 ‚Äì 6 August 1985) was a Guyanese politician and the leader of Cooperative Republic of Guyana from 1964 until his death in 1985, originally serving as Prime Minister from 1964 to 1980 then as its first Executive President from 1980 to 1985. He is often regarded as a strongman who embraced his own version of socialism.

He was widely-regarded as one of the principal architects of the post-colonial Guyanese state. Personal life and education Burnham, an Afro-Guyanese man, was born in Kitty, a suburb of Georgetown, East Demerara in Guyana, as one of three children. He attended the prestigious secondary school, Queen's College. In 1942, he won the Guiana Scholarship as the colony's top student. Burnham received a law degree from the London School of Economics in 1948. Burnham met many African and Caribbean students ‚Äì including Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Nigeria, Seretse Khama of Botswana and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana as well as Michael Manley of Jamaica and Errol Barrow of Barbados ‚Äì during his studies in London. He was married to Viola Burnham, who was also involved in politics. He has three children, Roxane, Annabelle, and Francesca from his first marriage to Bernice Lataste. His second marriage to Viola produced two daughters, Melanie and Ulele and later they adopted a son, Kamana.  Early years: The People's Progressive Party (PPP) Burnham was one of the founders of the People's Progressive Party (PPP), which was launched on 1 January 1950. The Indo-Guyanese labour leader Cheddi Jagan became Leader of the PPP and Burnham became its chairman.History of the PPP, PPP website. In 1952, Burnham became the president of the party's affiliated trade union, the British Guiana Labour Union. In 1953, the PPP won 18 of 24 seats in the first election by universal suffrage permitted by the British colonial government, with both Burnham and his sister Jessie elected to the House of Assembly. In the short-lived PPP government that followed, Burnham served as Minister of Education.Biographies of former presidents , GINA. In 1955, there was a split in the PPP between Burnham and Jagan (the result of differences in ideological perspectives between the two leaders, and the USA/Britain's desire ‚Äì and support towards Burnham ‚Äì to topple the PPP government). Jagan supported a socialist path,The Guyana story, from prehistory to independenceCheddi Jagan's 'the West on trial but Burnham believed that, given the geopolitical conditions of the era, communism would be a better alternative. American and British officials were unaware of this, and mistakenly believed Burnham to be somewhat more moderate than Jagan. As a result of foreign support, Burnham went on to form the People's National Congress (PNC) in 1958 entering its first election under that name in 1961.http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter133.html (see also: Forbidden Freedom by Cheddi Jagan)  Leader of Guyana: The People's National Congress (PNC) Forbes Burnham Presidential Standard In the 1964 election Jagan's PPP won the highest percentage of the vote (46% to the PNC's 41%), but it did not win a majority. Burnham succeeded in forming a coalition with the United Force (TUF) (which had won the remaining 12% of the votes) and became premier of British Guiana on 14 December. On 26 May 1966, British Guiana became an independent country and was renamed \\"Guyana\\". Due to the (at the time) radical views of Cheddi Jagan (who leaned towards communism ‚Äì both due to his socialist economic views, and his alliances with the Soviet Union and Cuba), Burnham was propped up by both the American and British Governments to assure the propagation of US/British control within the regionJagan, C. 1994. Forgotten Freedom. Hansib Publications Limited. Guyana. 3rd edition. At first, Burhnam pursued moderate policies, but in one of his first acts upon independence, he had passed a sweeping \\"National Security Act\\" giving the police the power to search, seize and arrest anyone virtually at will. He won full power in 1968, although many condemned the elections as fraudulent because of a large number of irregularities (such as questionable numbers of overseas voters on the rolls). In 1970, he veered sharply to the left and established strong relations with Cuba, the Soviet Union, North Korea and other communist countries. On 23 February of that year, he declared Guyana a \\"co-operative republic\\". Adopting a policy of autarky, he banned all forms of imports into the country, including flour and varieties of rice that had been integral to the diet of ethnic Indian citizens. Burnham also nationalised the major industries that were foreign-owned and -controlled, reducing the private sector's share of the economy to 10 percent by 1979. Burnham, after attending the 1970 summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Lusaka, Zambia, paid official visits to several African countries‚ÄîZambia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia‚Äîover the period 12‚Äì30 September 1970. The Guyanese government remained fully involved in the African liberation movement throughout the 1970s. Interestingly, although Guyana provided much-needed aid to African nations in their time of need - when Guyana was in its most dire times of need (the early 1990s and late 2010s), none of these African nations offered aid to Guyana. Burnham sent more than a hundred Guyanese public servants to various departments of the Zambian Government. Many Guyanese doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries worked in Southern African states throughout the 1970s. Current census data indicates that the majority of doctors, engineers, lawyers and secretaries currently working in Guyana originate from India, Sri Lanka, Cuba and China. In 1974 Burnham declared the PNC to be paramount and socialist.) citation needed) He won a 1978 referendum which made it much easier for the government to change the constitution. Anecdotal evidence from hundreds of Indo-Guyanese (and Afro-Guyanese who were PPP supporters) claims that PNC enforcers aggressively (and often violently) denied PPP supporters of the opportunity to vote. Most notably, official figures showed the referendum passing with an implausible 97 percent of the vote. In 1980 the constitution was changed to make the presidency an executive post (before this time, the post was held by Arthur Chung in a ceremonial head-of-state role). Burnham won election as president that year. Burnham introduced mass games to Guyana. They were first held in February 1980 to commemorate the founding of the Co- operative Republic of Guyana.https://apjjf.org/2015/13/4/Moe-Taylor/4258.html Burnham remained President of Guyana until his death. He died on 6 August 1985 after undergoing throat surgery in Georgetown Hospital. Burnham remained President of Guyana through the process of rigging elections, and squirreling ballot boxes at the Army headquarters, after which they were destroyed, without the votes being counted. According to Dr. Walter Rodney, Burnham's \\"style of rule has many similarities with that of the late Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza\\" - who not only oppressed the working class, but those in the upper echelons of the society who refused to go along with his domination. Walter Rodney was later assassinated, many believe because he stridently opposed Forbes Burnham and the PNC, who had a hand in his demise.

Hanlon was born in Brisbane, Colony of Queensland to Irish immigrant parents. He lived there throughout his life. After leaving school, he worked in the railways, and soon became a union official. In the 1912 Brisbane General Strike he played a prominent part as a militant. Between 1915 and 1919 Hanlon served in the 9th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division of the Australian Imperial Force, whose traditions and battle honours are proudly carried by the modern 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment. He served under Captain Cec Carroll during the war, who in 1934 Hanlon (then Minister for Home Affairs) would appoint as the Queensland Police Commissioner. He entered parliament in 1926, representing the Labor Party as member for Ithaca. After two decades and several cabinet portfolios (notably the Health Ministry, where he worked in tandem with doctor and administrator Sir Raphael Cilento), he became Queensland's Premier, once the septuagenarian Frank Cooper had retired. Over the years Hanlon's outlook mellowed, and he shifted to the political right. Having begun as a union militant, he ended up, as Premier, sending the police to suppress union demonstrations during the 1948 Queensland Railway strike. On June 17 1951, while in Canberra, Hanlon contracted bronchial pneumonia and spent three weeks in hospital before returning to Queensland on July 5. On 8 August, Hanlon was admitted to the Mater private hospital and received oxygen. After surviving, doctors warned that Hanlon would be ill for a long period of time. Following this, he took six months' leave of absence from the premiership. In October, it appeared that Hanlon was well enough to leave the hospital. However, suffering another setback, Hanlon remained in hopital until his death in January 1952. After his death in January 1952, he was succeeded by Vince Gair, the last leader of the state Labor Party administration which had been in power continuously ever since 1932. Hanlon was accorded a State funeral which took place from St Stephen's Cathedral to the Toowong Cemetery.Hanlon Edward Michael -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search.

Initially published by ECC Publications, and later EMAP, it was published in the UK between 1982 and 1993, and was the longest running Sinclair-based magazine. Like many similar magazines, it contained news, game reviews, previews, tips, help guides, regular columns, readers' letters and cover-mounted game demos. In May 1992 the former rival publication CRASH was notionally subsumed into Sinclair User but in practice this meant little more than the addition of the Crash! logo to the magazine's cover page.

Under David Kelly's editorial tenure, the magazine began to focus more on the gaming scene, and featured more colour graphics under designer Gareth \\"the Mad Celt\\". By the time of editor Graham Taylor, the magazine included the cartoon character Kamikaze Bear, and the tone of the publication changed from a semi-serious magazine to something aimed more at children.

History TV Palma was owned by Palma Ltd, a company set up in October 1991 by Belgrade-based lawyer Miodrag Miki Vujoviƒá.Business Registers Agency, business entities search (in Serbian) On 18 March 1993, TV Palma was launched as Belgrade's sixth TV station. Initially, it broadcast on the 39th channel from 17:00 to 02:00, and was one of the first TV stations in Serbia to play hardcore pornography (starting at a quarter to 01:00). The adult segment was later moved to 02:00, but the decision was reversed after public outcry. Vujoviƒá had already been running another TV station on the 34th channel, MV Channel Real Times, from 9 January 1992. The channel broadcast mainly business news and satellite reruns (MTV, Eurosport, The Children's Channel) and was sponsored by Jugoskandik, a fraudulent band run by Jezdimir Vasiljeviƒá, Vujoviƒá's groomsman (kum). MV Channel Real Times was initially broadcast from the premises of Borba, a newspaper closely aligned with the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia. Also, TV Palma's headquarters was initially located on the premises of the SPS near Ta≈°majdan. Vujoviƒá had been renting the office from the party, of which he was also a member. For this reason, it was widely speculated that both TV stations were ideologically closely aligned with the socialists, which was denied by Vujoviƒá. By the end of 1993, TV Palma had started broadcasting on the 34th channel, leaving only the graveyard slot reserved for the MV Channel Real Times, which was eventually cancelled altogether. In 1995, TV Palma tried to transfer to the 12th channel, challenging BK Telecom. The two stations went to court in late August 1995. In October 1995, the government officially granted the 12th channel to BK Telecom. On 10 February 1997 Miki Vujoviƒá and Dragoljub Milanoviƒá, general director of RTS, signed a deal stating that the two TV stations would work on the conception and realization of a unified program. Similar deals were signed around that time by other stations, as it allowed them to bypass a public bidding for the bandwidth by aligning their programming with the RTS. Following the renovation of the Magistrate in Zemun, the Serbian Radical Party, having signed a lease to the building for 30 years on 4 December 1998, signed a sublease to TV Palma. This was considered controversial as the SRS was part of the local government in Zemun at the time, and also subleasing was illegal. In May 2000 Vujoviƒá responded to accusations that the station was biased toward the SRS saying that any opposition party could pay for a show such as Radikalski talasi, and would be charged half the price. During the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá on 5 October 2000 TV Palma stopped broadcasting at around 19:05, broadcasting only the message \\"We cannot continue broadcasting while the city is in flames\\". The first guest following the overthrow was Dragoljub Miƒáunoviƒá. Following investigations by the new local government in Zemun, in June 2001 Federal Minister of Telecommunications Boris Tadiƒá came out with information that three television networks that were \\"more than close to the SPS\\" - TV Pink, BK Telecom and TV Palma owed 2,1 million DM in total. In April 2006 TV Palma and several other TV stations applied for broadcasting rights on the territory of Belgrade. Four NGOs, including the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, put out a statement saying that the council making the decision was \\"seeming to lose sight of its legal powers and boundaries, manifesting a lack of tolerance and was, akin to earlier ideological commissions, not hiding its intolerance towards media outlets whose editorial policy they did not like\\". In July 2006 the Republic Broadcasting Agency decided that only TV Most, held by SPS member Du≈°an Bajatoviƒá, and TV Palma were denied broadcasting rights. The Democratic Party supported this decision stating that both stations were responsible for hate speech and anti-democratic propaganda during the SPS government. The same month, the Law on Broadcasting was amended giving the RBA the power to seize any frequency that wasn't awarded to a TV station. On 26 December 2006 coercive measures were taken by the Republic Broadcasting Agency to prohibit the broadcasting of TV Palma. During the first half of 2007, and for a short period in May 2008, TV Palma broadcast via satellite.KingOfSat - Tv Palma On 14 July 2007 TV Palma started illegally transmitting from its old transmitter in Zemun on the 36th channel, causing distortions to TV Enter, the station occupying that frequency at the time. Authorities took action and stopped the transmission on 18 July 2007 on the count of piracy. In March 2009 Palma Ltd took the Republic Broadcasting Agency to court over the fact that the Council of the RBA did not have the legal capacity to prohibit the broadcasting of a TV station, a task normally deferred to Republic Telecommunications Agency. On 4 June 2009 the Supreme Court of Serbia ruled in favor of Palma Ltd. The RBA was forced to reexamine the request from July 2006 and, despite earlier indications, reiterated their earlier decision on 25 January 2010. TV Palma had been broadcasting during this period, starting in December 2009. Vujoviƒá even announced he had been planning on a fresh start with a new slogan - \\"Srpska, a svetska\\" (\\"Serbian, yet world-class\\"). Starting in late September 2011 TV Palma broadcast via cable (Kopernikus for Belgrade proper, and Avcom for Borƒça and Krnjaƒça). Its license was revoked on 8 January 2013 as a result of its large accumulated debt.Regulatory Authority for Electronic Media, Republic of Serbia - Tv Palma Programming Early on, TV Palma's program consisted mainly of turbo folk music videos. However, after the launch of TV Pink, Palma found it hard to compete and started broadcasting pirated films and satellite TV programs, as well as telenovelas. Already in 1994, TV Palma started sporadically broadcasting a number of US TV series including Dallas, Dynasty, The Colbys, Barnaby Jones, Remington Steele, The Flying Nun, The Big Valley, Cagney & Lacey, Tales of the Unexpected, Charlie's Angels, M*A*S*H, The Trials of Rosie O'Neill, The Young and Restless, Days of Our Lives and I'll Take Manhattan. Later, Palma broadcast a few US teen TV series including Dead at 21 and Kenan & Kel. By late 1998, TV Palma shifted its focus to broadcasting a number of political and art shows. Around the turn of 1999, the late-night adult program was cancelled. On 12 December 2000 TV Palma broadcast the first and only interview with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá following his overthrow. This was condemned by several MPs from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia including Neboj≈°a ƒåoviƒá. In late 2001 TV Palma canceled all its political shows and started to orient itself to more commercial content. Talk show host Olivera Miletoviƒá confirmed in an interview for Ekspres in May 2001 that this was a precondition set by the US before Palma could be allowed to broadcast via satellite.

The de facto coast guard of Australia is the Maritime Border Command, a joint command of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Border Force which works alongside the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Each state and territory government have specific maritime safety agencies and police marine units. In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organisations which act as auxiliary search and rescue services and maritime safety educators with the largest organisations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol established in 1937, the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard established in 1961, and Marine Rescue New South Wales established in 2009. Federal agencies Maritime Border Command The Maritime Border Command is the de facto coast guard of Australia. The Maritime Border Command is a joint unit of the Australian Defence Force (the Royal Australian Navy Patrol Force and the Royal Australian Air Force Surveillance and Response Group) and the Australian Border Force (Marine Unit and Coastwatch aircraft). It is responsible for border protection in the exclusive economic zone of Australia and its 19,650 kilometres of coastline and issues such as illegal fishing and exploitation of natural resources, maritime terrorism and piracy, biosecurity threats, and marine pollution. The Australian Federal Police supports the Maritime Border Command and particularly the Australian Border Force with criminal investigations, law enforcement and national security matters. Australian Maritime Safety Authority The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is responsible for maritime safety and seaworthiness of Australian and foreign vessels in Australian waters including compulsory pilotage, aids to navigation, the Australian Rescue Coordination Centre and coordination of search and rescue operations, and management of Australia's international maritime obligations. Australian Fisheries Management Authority The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is responsible for the management and sustainable use of fisheries resources and for combating illegal fishing activities in the Australian Fishing Zone. Office of Transport Security The Office of Transport Security has various responsibilities for maritime security. State agencies Each State Government also has agencies with coast guard responsibilities. Queensland Maritime Safety Queensland is responsible for maritime safety and the Queensland Police Service has a water police unit for law enforcement along the coastline, in waterways, and for Queensland islands. Western Australia Neither the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol nor the Australian Volunteer Coastguard are active in Western Australia, which is the largest state with the longest coastline. Inshore close to towns the West Australian Police co-ordinate local search and rescue between various state agencies (such as DOT, Fisheries and Water Police), Volunteer Sea Rescue Groups (VSRGs) who provide the majority of the assets and not for profit companies such as Westpac helicopter. Volunteer Marine Rescue Groups (VMRs) form the core of the system with three main areas of emergency response / search And rescue (SAR), education, and radio monitoring. VMRs (37) are affiliated to DFES (Department of Fire and Emergency Services) or two maintain independence from government and act as charities (in much the same way as the RNLI in UK work). The 3 largest VMRs are part of DFES including Mandurah the oldest VMR group in WA. Whitford Volunteer Sea Rescue's two main lifeboats \\"Stacy Hall\\" (Left) and \\"city of Joondalup\\" (Right) Community organisations In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organizations, the two largest organizations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (established in 1937) and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (established in 1961). These volunteer organizations have no law enforcement powers, and are essentially auxiliary Search and Rescue services. In NSW these two organisations have joined to become Marine Rescue in 2009. Marine Rescue NSW In November 2008, the NSW Government announced the establishment of a new volunteer marine rescue organisation to be called Marine Rescue NSW, (MRNSW) which was incorporated in July 2009. Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (NSW units) and Volunteer Rescue Association (marine units) united under the new organisation which began operation on 1 January 2010. Marine Rescue NSW is a charitable organisation similar to the RNLI in Britain. It provides radio and rescue services over New South Wales with 44 units along the coast including two inland units and has over 3000 volunteers. It is also a registered training organisation ensuring that its members are trained and maintain competencies. The NSW Government imposes an annual levy of $7 both on boat registration and on boat driver licences to provide funds for MRNSW to refurbish and replace old boats and equipment. As at 1 January 2016, MRNSW has refurbished a number of boats and purchased many new purpose built boats. MRNSW members are volunteer and in addition to their duties as radio operators, boat crew and many other tasks spend large amounts of time raising funds needed in addition to those provided by the government.  Australian Volunteer Coast Guard  Australian Volunteer Coastguard vessel The Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Association was established in 1961, and modelled on the US Coast Guard Auxiliary, the association is an organisation composed entirely of volunteers. It guards the coast in the most effective way - initially by education, example, examination and finally by search and rescue. The Australian Volunteer Coast Guard has no law enforcement powers. Flotillas and radio bases are located from the Skardon River in the Gulf of Carpentaria, down the eastern seaboard to Ceduna in South Australia, including Tasmania and major inland lakes and weirs. Coast Guard currently has more than 2,500 Regular members and 9,000 Associate members. Expansion is continuing in areas of need. Australian Volunteer Coast Guard resources across Australia include: *107 Association-owned rescue vessels *147 radio bases under the control of 72 local flotillas *30 communication and display vans and 4WD vehicles *Registered Training Organisations delivering competency based training *Formal affiliations and collaborations with similar organisations in Australia, New Zealand, North America, the Philippines and Europe.  Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol  In 1936 Commander Rupert Long, OBE, RAN, Director of Naval Intelligence raised with retired Captain Maurice Blackwood, DSO, RN the possibility of raising a group of trained yachtsmen as a Naval Auxiliary Service. Discussions were held with HWG Nobbs and W Giles, both Sydney yachtsmen and a proposal sent to the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board that a Volunteer Coastal Patrol be established under the command of Captain Blackwood. The Naval Board supported this and on 27 March 1937 the Volunteer Coastal Patrol was established under the command of Captain Blackwood, DSO, RN (rtd) with H.W.G. Nobbs as Staff Officer Operations and W Giles as Staff Officer Administration. During World War II Coastal Patrol members became special constables and guarded commercial wharves, oil installations and bridges. By the war's end, patrol vessels had patrolled 128,000 miles of harbour and coastal waters and donated 393,000-man-hours of unpaid war service. They were granted the right to fly the Police Nemesis pennant as recognition of this service and the right to fly the New South Wales State Flag as their ensign. Post war development saw the Patrol undertake civilian search and rescue operations as their primary role but maintain their original Royal Australian Navy inspired organisation structure, ranks and uniform. 1955 saw a democratically elected council formed which directed the development and administration of the Patrol and appointed the Officer Commanding. 1963 saw the Patrol become an incorporated company and the articles of association written. In 1974, Her Majesty the Queen granted the Patrol the privilege of adding the Royal prefix to its title when it became the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (RVCP). In 2008 the NSW State Government after strong representations by RVCP agreed to the amalgamation of the three volunteer rescue organisations (RVCP, Volunteer Rescue Association (marine sections) and Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (NSW units) into one organisation which became Volunteer Marine Rescue NSW (VMRNSW) and commenced operation on 1 January 2010. Today VMRNSW works closely with all government agencies in search and rescue and education to the boating public. They maintain constant watch in Radio Bases for marine traffic, work with the Water Police in search and rescue as well as crowd control at major maritime events, run education classes in seamanship, navigation, first aid and meteorology for the public as well as providing constant information to Radio Stations and TV stations regarding sea conditions etc. The NSW Government imposes an annual levy of $7 on boat registration and boat driver licences to fund the operation of VMRNSW which has enabled the replacement and refurbishment of many old boats and equipment. All members of the Patrol are volunteers with a large proportion of their time devoted to raising funds needed in addition to the government provision.  Proposals for an Australian Coast Guard  After the Tampa affair, and the declaration of the War on Terrorism, in 2001 Kim Beazley announced that the Australian Labor Party, if in government, would establish an Australian Coast Guard \\"responsible for conducting Australia's coastal surveillance and meeting Australia's maritime protection needs, including in relation to illegal immigration, drugs, fisheries, and quarantine-related issues\\". -- Kim Beazley's address to the Asia-Australia Institute at the University of New South Wales This plan met with criticism. Peter Reith criticised Beazley for stating that an Australian Coast Guard both will and will not be an \\"answer to the question of people smuggling\\". The plan was criticised by the Australian government, on the grounds that it would either be prohibitively expensive or inadequate to the task. Later, the motives for the establishment of an Australian Coast Guard were interpreted by some as \\"a plan to extend the capabilities of the Australian Federal Police.\\"  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Marine Rescue NSW Official Website * Coastwatch Official Website * Australian Volunteer Coast Guard official web site * Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol official web site Category:Coast guards Category:Sea rescue organizations Category:Organisations based in Australia with royal patronage Category:Emergency services in Victoria (Australia) Category:Marine occupations Category:Coastline of Australia ","title":"Coast guards in Australia"},{"id":"1120158","text":"Ange-Jacques Gabriel (23 October 1698 ‚Äì 4 January 1782) was the principal architect of King Louis XV of France. His major works included the Place de la Concorde, the √âcole Militaire, and the Petit Trianon and opera theater at the Palace of Versailles. His style was a careful balance between French Baroque architecture and French neoclassicism.Gallet (1999), pp. 256-57 Biography Early life and career Ange-Jacques Gabriel was born on October 23, 1698, to a famous Parisian family of architects, and was connected by marriage with another celebrated architect of the time, Fran√ßois Mansart. His grandfather was an architect, and his father, Jacques Gabriel (1667-1742) received the title of Controller of the Buildings of the King at the age of twenty-one. His father's major projects included the Hotel de Ville of Rennes and the Place Royale (now Place de la Bourse) in Bordeaux. The young Ange-Jacques became a member of the Acad√©mie royale d'architecture in 1728, and assisted his father on the Place de la Bourse. He became the principal assistant to his father as Premier Architecte at the Versailles from 1735 and, after his father's death, succeeded him as chief architect of the King.Gallet (1999), pp. 256-57 In his new position He served the supervision of two successive Directors of the Buildings of the King, Tournehem and Abel-Fran√ßois Poisson, the Marquis de Marigny, the brother of the King's mistress and cultural advisor, Madame de Pompadour.Gallet (1999), pp. 256-57 Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde) File:Attributed to Alexandre-Jean No√´l (French - A View of Place Louis XV - Google Art Project.jpg|The Place Louis XV in about 1775 File:Rue Royale Concorde Madeleine.jpg|The Place de la Concorde The Place Louis XV, today's Place de la Concorde, was the first major project undertaken by Gabriel, in 1748. He was asked to find a compromise between several competing plans for the development of the marshy land between the gates of the Tuileries Palace gardens and the new Champs-Elysees. The land was donated by the King. Gabriel took elements of several different plans, being careful leave the view toward the Seine open, and to preserve unobstructed the long axis between the Tuileries and the Champs-Elysees. He created a new north‚Äìsouth axis, connecting the Place with the new Madeleine church, under construction, and two symmetrical palace-on the north side of the square, on either side of Rue Rye Royale. The facades of the palaces, with rows of Corinthian columns, were modeled after the colonnades of the Louvre. The centerpiece of the square was an equestrian statue of Louis XV. The project was finalized in 1754 and was completed in 1763. The statue of Louis XV was removed during the French Revolution, and the obelisk, statues and fountains were added in the 19th century.Gallet (1999), pp. 257-258 Ecole Militaire File:Ecole Militaire Projet.jpg|Gabriel's plan for the Ecole Militaire File:Central building of Ecole Militaire at dusk, Paris 7e 20140607 1.jpg|The Ecole Militaire File:√âcole Militaire Chapelle St Louis.jpg|Chapel of Saint Louis Louis XV decided in 1751 to create the Ecole Militaire, the first French military academy, to train five hundred young men from poor noble families \\"gentlemen\\" in the art of warfare. The site chosen was next to the plain of Grenelle, on the left bank to the west of the city center. Gabriel's plan called for a \\"chateau\\" with two wings flanking a central pavilion with a dome, similar to that of the Louvre. The building featured a facade with a colonnade of the Doric order, and to the rear had a large courtyard with a facade of superimposed orders of columns, opening onto Place Fontenoy, A chapel was artfully integrated into the architecture of the main building. The interior featured a lavishly-decorated salon, now the Salle des Marechals, connected to the grand floor by a majestic ramp, and the Chapel of Louis IX, or Saint Louis, the patron saint of the Army. Two additional wings along Avenue de la Motte-Piquet were added in the 19th century.Gallet (1999), pp. 259-260 The Petit Trianon File:Petit Trianon - Fa√ßade ouest.jpg|West facade of the Petit Trianon File:Vue a√©rienne du domaine de Versailles par ToucanWings - Creative Commons By Sa 3.0 - 053.jpg|Aerial view of the Petit Trianon and its small park At the request of Madame Pompadour, Gabriel had made plans for a smaller pavilion at Versailles away from the main palace and the Trianon. With the end of the expensive Seven Years' War Louis XV approved the plans, and between 1763 and 1768 the small chateau was constructed. The building was cubic, and each facade was different; each was decorated with pilasters, columns and pediments in perfect proportion and harmony. The facades of the Petit Trianon represented in its most pure form the emerging style of Neoclassicism in France.

The palace lacked a proper opera theater; a theater had been commanded under Louis XIV in 1682 for the end of the North Wing but the project had been put on hold due to its cost of the King's wars and the complexity of meeting the needs of the Court. Gabriel made a new proposal for the same sit in 1748, but it was also put on hold due to the cost. occupied himself with numerous modifications to the exterior of the Palace, notably the completion and extension of the North Wing, following closely the original designs of Mansard This was completed in 1764. The Opera project was revived in 1765 and was accelerated in 1770 for the celebrations of the marriage of the Dauphin, the future Louis XVI, to the Archiduchesse of Austria, Marie-Antoinette. To finish the project quickly and at lower cost, the theater was made entirely of wood, painted to resemble marble, but also giving it exceptionally good acoustics. The theater was in blue and gold, made in shape of truncated ellipse or oval, surrounded by tiers of boxes, decorated with carved and gilded wood, illuminated by three thousand candles whose light was reflected in mirrors. By this time Louis XV had a new mistress, Madame Du Barry, and the royal box, the size of three ordinary boxes, had a grill to protect their privacy. Sculptures by Augustin Pajou and a painted ceiling by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau completed the interior. Gabriel and his chief architectural engineer, Blaise Arnaud, studied installing a mechanism to hoist the floor of the theater up to the level of the stage, to create an enormous ballroom, but this was never completed. Death His final projects were the completion of the facades of the buildings he designed for the Place de la Concorde; the former H√¥tel de Coislin, and the Hotel Crillon, finished in 1770. and the building of what today is the Hotel de la Marine, the headquarters of the French Navy until 2016, which was finished in 1774. He died in Paris in 1782. Style His sober rationality in planning and detail promoted the transition from Rococo to Neoclasscism. He was not especially known for boldness or originality; borrowing extensively from the French classicism and early classical models, particularly from the Louvre. He was known for his craftsmanship, his ability to balance the animation of the Baroque style with the more restrained neoclassicism, the proportions and balance and careful detail of his buildings, and his ability to create dramatic and harmonious ensembles of monumental buildings, as he did in the Place de la Concorde.

The film was shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey where many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century. Location shots in New York City reportedly used actual street gang members as extras during the film. It was also shown in Leeds Film Festival in November 2008, as part of Back to the Electric Palace, with live music by Gabriel Prokofiev, performed in partnership with Opera North. In 2016, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot The film is about a poor married couple living in New York City. The husband works as a musician and must often travel for work. When returning, his wallet is taken by a gangster. His wife goes to a ball where a man tries to drug her, but his attempt is stopped by the same man who robbed the husband. The two criminals become rivals, and a shootout ensues.

History The bed is named after William Lawrence Murphy (1876‚Äì1957), an Irish immigrant in New York who wanted to find a creative method of making space in his small apartment. He applied for his first patents around 1900. According to legend, he was wooing an opera singer, but living in a one-room apartment in San Francisco, and the moral code of the time frowned upon a woman entering a man's bedroom. Murphy's invention converted his bedroom into a parlor, enabling him to entertain. Earlier foldup beds had existed, and were even available through the Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog, but Murphy introduced pivot and counterbalanced designs for which he received a series of patents, including one for a \\"Disappearing Bed\\" on June 18, 1912 and another for a \\"Design for a Bed\\" on June 27, 1916. Murphy beds are used for space-saving purposes, much like trundle beds, and are popular where floor space is limited, such as small houses, apartments, hotels, mobile homes and college dormitories. In recent years, Murphy bed units have included options such as lighting, storage cabinets, and office components. They have seen a resurgence in popularity in the early 2010s due to the weak economy, with children moving back in with their parents and families choosing to renovate homes rather than purchasing larger ones. In 1989, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the term \\"Murphy Bed\\" had entered common usage so thoroughly that it was no longer eligible for trademark protection. Designs and models Most Murphy beds do not have box springs. Instead, the mattress usually lies on a wood platform or wire mesh and is held in place so as not to sag when in a closed position. The mattress is attached to the bed frame, often with elastic straps to hold the mattress in position when the unit is folded upright. Piston-lifts or torsion springs make modern Murphy beds easy to lower and raise. Instructions for operating a Murphy bed Since the first model several other variations and designs have been created, including: sideways-mounted Murphy beds, Murphy bunk beds, and solutions that include other functions. Murphy beds with tables or desks that fold down when the bed is folded up are popular, and there are also models with sofas and shelving solutions. Risks If not secured or used properly, a Murphy bed could collapse on the operator. A 1945 court case in Illinois found that a tenant assumed the risk of injury from a wall bed installed in a rented inn room.Robert A. Tingler, \\"Assumption of the Risk in Illinois\\". Chicago-Kent Law Review 44 (1967), pp. 180-191, at p. 187, discussing Duncan v. Chelsea Hotel Co., 326 Ill App. 241, 61 N.E.2d 769 (1st Dist. 1945).

In popular culture Murphy beds were a common setup for comic scenes in early cinema, including in silent films. The earliest known film to feature a Murphy bed is the lost 1900 Biograph Company film A Bulletproof Bed, which was remade in 1903 by Edison Pictures as the extant film Subub Surprises the Burglar.Anthony Balducci, The Funny Parts: A History of Film Comedy Routines and Gags. McFarland, 2012, pp. 168‚Äì77. It was a recurrent slapstick element in many Keystone Studios productions of the 1910s, including Cursed by His Beauty (1914), Fatty's Reckless Fling (1915), He Wouldn't Stay Down (1915), and Bath Tub Perils (1916). Charlie Chaplin's 1916 One AM also features an exaggerated encounter with a Murphy bed. Later films which use Murphy beds as comic props (often to cause injury or frustration, or to hide a clandestine guest) include Laurel and Hardy's Be Big (1930), Jimmy Stewart and Ginger Rogers's Vivacious Lady (1938), Buster Keaton's Spite Marriage (1929) and Nothing But Pleasure (1940), Abbott and Costello's Hit the Ice (1943), several Three Stooges shorts (including 1952's Corny Casanovas), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, the Popeye cartoon Shuteye Popeye, Bob Hope's Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number (1966), the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, The Night They Raided Minsky's, Mel Brooks's Silent Movie, The Pink Panther Strikes Again, The Great Muppet Caper, Police Academy 2, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Spy Hard, and Freddy vs. Jason. Murphy beds have also been used in television series; for example, Caroline Channing used a Murphy bed in 2 Broke Girls, and an episode of Laverne and Shirley re-creates scenes from Chaplin's One A.M. Murphy bed gag. Murphy beds were a routine enough feature of comic film to invite commentary from retailers; one store based in Vancouver, British Columbia remarked in an advertisement, \\"Gone are the days of Laurel and Hardy where the beds were portrayed as a fold away trap for your worst enemies.\\" In comics, the Murphy bed is depicted in the Tintin book Red Rackham's Treasure as being an invention of Professor Calculus.

By URAP 2019, it is ranked 1st among the Turkish universities. The University has two main campuses. The first campus is located in the old town of Ankara and hosts the Medical Centre, and the second one, Beytepe Campus is from the city centre. The Beytepe Campus covers of green land and woodland, and hosts the faculties of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Law, Education, Engineering, Fine Arts, Letters, and Science. In addition to these two main campuses, the School of Social Work is located at Ke√ßi√∂ren, and the Turkish State Conservatory in Ankara, affiliated with the University as of 1982, is located at the Be≈üevler Campus. General information History Hittite stag, which served as the inspiration for the Hacettepe University emblem The history of Hacettepe University can be traced back to the establishment of the Institute of Child Health on July 8, 1958, and the inauguration of the Hacettepe Children's Hospital founded by Prof. Dr. ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ±. In 1961 the School of Health Sciences and its divisions of Nursing, Medical Technology, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation and Nutrition were opened, all centered on the Institute of Child Health. On June 15, 1963, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine was established and a general teaching hospital was built. Three months later Hacettepe University School of Dentistry was established. In the summer of 1964, a School of Basic Sciences was opened, offering courses in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities. At the time, all Hacettepe teaching institutions were affiliated to Ankara University and grouped under the title \\"Hacettepe Science Center\\". Hacettepe University was chartered through Act No. 892 of the Turkish Parliament on July 8, 1967. Hacettepe Institutes of Higher Education formed the core of Hacettepe University, and the Faculties of Medicine, Science and Engineering, and Social and Administrative sciences were established. In 1969 Hacettepe School of Pharmacy and Health Administration were established. In 1971 with a reorganization, the former schools were given faculty status and thus they became the Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Pharmacy and Faculty of Science. In 1973 the School of Technology was established. In I982 the former faculties were reorganized as the Faculty of Letters, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Fine Arts, Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences and the State Conservatory was affiliated to Hacettepe University. In 1984 the School of Health services and in 1989 the School of Sport Sciences and Technology were established. Recently in 1998 the two Polatli; Vocational Schools and Kaman Vocational School have been established. Official Seal The emblem of the University was designed in 1967 by Dr. Y√ºcel Tanyeri, then a second year medical student, in the likeness of a stag ‚Äì the symbol of a Hittite deity discovered at the royal tombs in Alacah√∂y√ºk. Inspired by this archeological symbol common to the region, the Stag was chosen as the symbol of the University, and was abstracted to represent a lowercase \\"h\\" ‚Äì the first letter of the university's name.

Law enforcement officers are employed by all three levels of government ‚Äì federal, state/territory, and local. Federally, the main law enforcement agency is the Australian Federal Police (AFP), which has a wide mandate to enforce Australian criminal law and protect its national interests. There are also a number of other agencies that have powers confined to specific areas, such as national security (ASIO), customs and immigration (ABF), and white-collar crime (ATO, ACCC, ASIC). Each branch of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) has its own military police, although there is also an overarching ADF Investigative Service for more complex investigations. Mounted police officers in Victoria As each Australian state enacts its laws, general law enforcement duties are the responsibility of state police forces, who are in turn responsible to a government minister (usually the Minister for Police). These forces carry out the bulk of general policing throughout the entire state, including in metropolitan areas. Other state-government departments may also have investigative powers for specific offences within their purview. The Northern Territory also has its police force, but in Australia's other territories (including the Australian Capital Territory) law enforcement is handled by the federal government. Australian state and federal police routinely carry firearms. While on duty, most officers' duty belts consist of a handgun, Taser, expandable baton, pepper spray, a set of handcuffs, ammunition magazines, gloves, torch, and a two-way radio. Local governments have their own smaller force of authorised officers ‚Äì known as council rangers ‚Äì to enforce local laws pertaining solely to individual local government jurisdictions. Council rangers generally do not have full police powers (unless they are sworn as special constables). Federal Australian Federal Police The primary federal law enforcement agency in Australia is the Australian Federal Police. The AFP is responsible for the investigation of federal offences (crimes against the Commonwealth) and has federal jurisdiction throughout Australia. They provide protective services to federal government property and personnel/dignitaries, including major airports, buildings, foreign embassies/diplomats and provide state-styled law enforcement services to external territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory. The boundaries between the two levels of law enforcement are somewhat flexible and both state and federal police cooperate on or transfer cases between each other depending on the specific circumstances. The AFP also provides liaison officers to various overseas posts to assist in relations with various police forces overseas, as well as providing community policing to assist in the development of foreign law enforcement agencies and peacekeeping operations in locations such as the Solomon Islands with the RAMSI Mission and Cyprus. The AFP was created in 1979, having been the result of an amalgamation of the now-defunct Commonwealth Police and Australian Capital Territory Police Force. This makes it quite young as many of the various state police forces were established in the 19th century. Border Force police in Fremantle Australian Border Force The Australian Border Force is responsible for customs and immigration enforcement and border protection at Australia's ports as well as in Australian waters and conducts investigations where the AFP does not have primary jurisdiction. Unlike AFP Officers, Border Force Officers do not have fully vested federal police powers and can only arrest and detain powers at Airport jurisdiction. They may, however, detain persons for state or federal crimes or warrants until that person can be presented to a federal or state law enforcement officer with the appropriate powers. Australian Border Force officers have the authority to carry firearms when a supervisor approves. In practice, only maritime, specialist counter-terrorism officers and Investigators carry firearms. Military Military Police, also known as Service Police, are the law enforcement branches of the services of a military tasked with enforcing and investigating offences violating military law. In Australia, each service of the Australian Defence Force maintains its independent police force made up of military personnel from that service. Along with the independent service police forces is the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service, a special ADF unit made up of Investigators from each service's police and tasked with investigating more serious military offences. Australian Army Military Police Law enforcement duties in the Australian Army are provided by the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police. MPs provide everything from general law enforcement duties on military installations to investigations, close personal protection and more. National common policing services South Australia Police Security Response Section Officers The Australia New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency (ANZPAA) was established in October 2007. ANZPAA is a joint initiative of the Australian and New Zealand Police Commissioners and is funded by contributions to Australia and New Zealand Police jurisdictions. ANZPAA is a non-operational policing agency that provides strategy and policy advice, and secretarial services to the ANZPAA Board on cross-jurisdictional policing initiatives that help enhance community safety and security. ANZPAA's strategic direction is set by ANZPAA‚Äôs board and the Australia New Zealand Council of Police Professionalisation (ANZCoPP, formerly Australasian Police Professional Standards Committee, APPSC). The Australasian Police Professional Standards Committee (APPSC) was an organisation that served all police jurisdictions around Australia and New Zealand. It was the body for police education and training in Australia and New Zealand; the council comprising each of the police commissioners from Australia and New Zealand along with the president of the Police Federation of Australia and the president of the New Zealand Police Association. On 9 November 2007, APPSC roles and functions were amalgamated into ANZPAA. In 2013, APPSC was retitled to the Australia New Zealand Council of Police Professionalisation. Crime Stoppers programs run in each state and nationally. Crime Stoppers programs collect information about crimes and pass it on to the police, ensuring that the community can participate in crime-fighting. CrimTrac is an intergovernmental policing agency that supports Australian policing through the provision of forensic and other information and investigative tools between state and federal police departments. The National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS) is a national fingerprint database, administered by CrimTrac. State Officers of the Queensland Police Service on patrol Each state, as well as the Northern Territory, is responsible for maintaining its police force which is responsible for policing at the state and local levels. This involves general law and order, traffic policing, major crime, anti-terrorism branches, water police, search and rescue and in some states transit police. Local policing in the Australian Capital Territory, Jervis Bay Territory and Australia's external territories are contracted to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). In some states, local governments employ by-laws officers or rangers to enforce local by-laws or ordinances relating to such matters as parking, dog ownership, retailing, littering, or water usage. These local government officers are not considered to be police forces as they generally only have the power to issue fines and do not have the same powers as state police. They may rely upon appointment as a special constable or legislated powers for their authority.  Policing agencies  State police also perform certain functions on behalf of the Australian government such as the enforcement of various Commonwealth Acts and regulations in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police and other Commonwealth officers. While ACT policing is under the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police, the following policing agencies are regulated by their respective state or territory government and are highly visible: * New South Wales Police Force * Northern Territory Police * Queensland Police Service * South Australia Police * Tasmania Police * Victoria Police * Western Australia Police Sheriffs In recent years, the states and territories have returned the responsibility of recovering court- ordered fines to their sheriffs. In practice, the police often carry out the functions of sheriffs and bailiffs in rural and more sparsely populated areas of Australia. The office of sheriff was first established in Australia in 1824. This was simultaneous with the appointment of the first Chief Justice of New South Wales. The role of the sheriff has not been static, nor is it identical in each Australian state. In the past a sheriff's duties included: executing court judgments, acting as a coroner, the transportation of prisoners, managing the jails, and carrying out executions (through the employment of an anonymous hangman). Currently, no Australian state provides for capital punishment. A government department (usually called the Department of Corrections or similar) now runs the prison system and the coroner's office handles coronal matters. The sheriff is now largely responsible for enforcing the civil orders and fines of the court by seizing and selling the property of judgment debtors who do not satisfy the debt, providing court security, enforcing arrest warrants, evictions, taking juveniles into custody and running the jury system. Some state sheriffs can also apply a wide range of sanctions ranging from suspending driver's licenses and car registration through to wheel clamping and arranging community service orders, and as a last resort can make arrests. Local Typical Council Ranger vehicle fitted with orange lights and a K9 Kube for dog collection Council rangers are officers employed by local government areas in Australia to enforce the by- laws (local laws in Western Australia); of those local governments and a limited range of state laws relating to such matters as litter control, animal control, dog laws, fire control, off-road vehicles, emergency management, and parking. Unless they are also sworn in as special constables, as many are, rangers do not have full police powers. Council rangers are also referred to as local laws officers in some of Australia's eastern states. Most Council rangers have the power to issue fines that don't exceed a certain amount. Transportation By agreement between the various commissioners, most police cars in Australia are predominantly white, with a blue and white Sillitoe tartan checkered strip on the side. Some jurisdictions' highway patrol units and police also have fluorescent stripes surrounding the tartan. Most general patrol cars are Holden Commodores or Ford Falcons, while Highway Patrol vehicles are often higher performance vehicles such as the Holden Commodore SS and Ford Falcon XR6 with more recent additions including the Chrysler 300 SRT, BMW 530d, Kia Stinger, Volkswagen Passat, Mercedes-Benz E400d and Toyota Aurion. Prisoner transport vehicles are based on light commercial vehicles such as the Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux, Holden Colorado, Mercedes Vito or Volkswagen Transporter. . A wide range of vehicles are used for unmarked purposes to not be easily identified as police. Many of these vehicles are also specifically chosen to fit in with civilian vehicles. Emergency lights on police vehicles are now generally blue and red; historically though, blue lights were used for police vehicles and red lights for fire engines and ambulances. Council Ranger vehicles are usually fitted with either magenta or orange coloured lights. Most Australian police services have mounted police units that are prominently used for ceremonial purposes, although in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria the mounted police also undertake operational policing duties.

Composition of the subclass has also varied; however, by definition it always includes the family Asteraceae (Compositae). In the modern APG IV system of classification, asterid and euasterid are names for clades with a composition similar to that of Asteridae. One of the better-known and more influential systems that formally recognized subclass Asteridae was the Cronquist system devised by botanist Arthur Cronquist, which included the orders: * Gentianales * Solanales * Lamiales * Callitrichales * Plantaginales * Scrophulariales * Campanulales * Rubiales * Dipsacales * Calycerales * Asterales Most of the above orders as defined by Cronquist have definitely been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent molecular systematic studies. To a large extent Cronquist's subclass Asteridae corresponds with the older concepts of Sympetalae and Tubiflorae, groups that were defined by having their petals united into a tube. However, these older classifications contained some sympetalous families, such as Cucurbitaceae, that are now known not to be closely related. Cronquist's concept also corresponds closely with the APG II group of euasterids but the APG does not formally recognize a group called \\"Asteridae\\" (or any other group above the rank of order). Recent phylogenetic studies have suggested that several families, including three major orders not included in Asteridae by Cronquist, Ericales, Cornales, and Apiales, also belong to the asterid group. The circumscription of subclass Asteridae, as well as the circumscriptions of the orders contained within it, is currently in a state of flux; many systematic botanists refer to these as clades (asterids, euasterids, etc.), rather than use formal names such as subclass Asteridae.

It adds support for transparently decompressed, read-only block devices. It is not a compressed file system: cloop is mostly used as a convenient way to compress conventional file systems onto Live CDs. Cloop was originally written for the Levanta Bootable Business Card by Rusty Russell, but is now maintained by Klaus Knopper, the author of Knoppix. A compression ratio of about 2.5:1 is common for software. The Knoppix cloop image, for example, is 700 MB compressed and around 1.8 GB uncompressed.  Design  cloop images contain: * A shell script (with mount commands for the image) * A header with the number of blocks and the uncompressed block size * A seek index with compressed and uncompressed block sizes in pairs * zlib-compressed data blocks, packed end-to-end The data blocks are compressed separately; this makes it possible to seek to individual blocks without having to decompress the entire image from the start, but at the cost of slightly reducing the compression ratio. Live CD images typically use a block size of 256 KB as a compromise between decompression speed and space-efficiency. Apple uses a similar file format in the compressed variant of its DMG disk images.  Limitations  The design of the cloop driver requires that compressed blocks be read whole from disk. This makes cloop access inherently slower when there are many scattered reads, which can happen if the system is low on memory or when a large program with many shared libraries is starting. A big issue is the seek time for CD-ROM drives (~80 ms), which exceeds that of hard disks (~10 ms) by a large factor. On the other hand, because files are packed together, reading a compressed block may thus bring in more than one file into the cache. The effects of tail packing are known to improve seek times (cf. reiserfs, btrfs), especially for small files. Some performance tests related to cloop have been conducted. 31-Dec-2011  See also  * loop device * Cramfs * SquashFS * e2compr  References   External links  * cloop sources against the mainline Linux kernels and a patch to support any known cloop format.

Early life and family Born in Auckland on 7 October 1957, Morgan affiliates to the Tainui iwi confederation. He was educated at St Stephen's School, Bombay from 1970 to 1971, and Huntly College from 1971 to 1976. He then gained a Diploma of Teaching, and taught English and MƒÅori studies at Huntly College from 1980 to 1982, and Birkdale College (1982). His brother-in-law is Tau Henare. Broadcasting Morgan worked as news and current affairs reporter at both Television New Zealand and TV3. He was also head of sport, youth and current affairs programmes at the short- lived Aotearoa Television Network. Member of Parliament Morgan was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as the New Zealand First MP for Te Tai HauƒÅuru. New Zealand First captured all five MƒÅori seats in the 1996 election (including Te Tai HauƒÅuru) - Morgan and the other four MƒÅori MPs became known as the Tight Five. During his term in Parliament he was involved in a number of controversies. One scandal in 1997 revolved around his spending NZ$4000 of Aotearoa Television funds on clothes including a pair of $89 underpants. Morgan resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, becoming an independent MP. He later joined the newly formed Mauri Pacific. In the 1999 election, Morgan was ranked second on Mauri Pacific's party list, and contested the Te Tai HauƒÅuru seat again, but was not returned to Parliament. He then returned to television and film production. Life after parliament He was chair of Te Arataura, the Waikato-Tainui executive board, from 2006 until 2012, except for a period in 2004 when he was removed from office because of a criminal conviction for obstructing police during a protest march in the 1980s.

The original reason for the long dispute is unknown, and the first outbreaks of violence were in the 1450s, prior to the Wars of the Roses. The antagonists would later meet in battle several times during the feud. Origins and context Wressle Castle in 2009: Forfeited by the Percys, it is possible they feared its loss to the Nevilles. Yorkshire‚Äôs three Ridings were divided up between the crown (as Duke of Lancaster), the Percy family, Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 321 However, the king and the duke of York do not seem to have visited Yorkshire very often, which Ralph Griffiths suggests meant that any tension would be solely between Percy and Neville. Indeed, he says, since the city of York itself was the most important, the capital-city of the north, it ‚Äòprovided a focus for their rivalries.‚Äô It is not, he said, a coincidence that ‚Äòthe two virtual battles between Percy and Neville in 1453 and 1454 were fought close to the city‚Äôs walls.‚ÄôGriffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 322 He also suggests that Percy tenants may have been as anti-Neville as their lords, since their estates were contiguous, this could have encouraged rivalry and bred antagonism.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 331 As Professor Pollard has pointed out, Salisbury retained some of his knights from 'deep in Percy country, particularly southern Northumberland.Pollard, A.J., 'The Northern Retainers of Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury', Northern History, 11 (1976), 61 Griffiths has suggested that by the mid-fifteenth century, relations between Percy and Neville were 'poisoned by jealousy and resentment.‚ÄôGriffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 322 Further, he has pointed out that Salisbury probably did not expect- and not receive- the assistance of the Raby branch of his family (by his father's first wife, Margaret Stafford), which he puts down to the previous feud between the two branches of the family over the division of Westmorland's will.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 323 Robin Storey has also pointed out how Northumberland seems to have been receiving less royal favour than Salisbury.Storey, R.L., The End of the House of Lancaster (London, 1966), 134: Northumberland ‚Äòhad been appointed Constable of England on 25 May 1450, but he had been replaced by Somerset four months later. He had not the Nevilles success in tapping the king‚Äôs bounty.‚Äô He points out however, that when trouble came, it was to be the earls' sons, not the lords themselves, that would start it.Storey, R.L., The End of the House of Lancaster (London, 1966), 134 The degree to which the two earls were assisting and encouraging the feud behind the scenes has also been questioned. Griffiths, for example, has said that Thomas and John were Salisbury's direct representatives in it.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 325 Immediate causes for the feud Various immediate causes having been ascribed to causing the outbreak of violence in 1454. Professor Griffiths has suggested that Lord Cromwell's manor of Wressle, Yorkshire, was seized by the Percys following the joining of the Cromwell and Neville families in marriage in 1453 (see below),Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 358 and that Cromwell viewed the Nevilles as allies against the Percys. Likewise, Warwick's feud with Somerset in south Glamorgan may have driven him into an alliance with the duke of York against him.Griffiths, R.A., 'The King's Council and the First Protectorate of the Duke of York, 1453-1454,' English Historical Review, 99 (1984), 73 Griffiths also suggests that the single most important event to precipitate the feud was the marriage of Salisbury's second son, Thomas Neville to Maud Stanhope, the widow of Robert, Lord Willoughby.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 322 Not only, says Griffiths, was any further aggrandisement for Salisbury's family anathema to the Percys, but the new Cromwell connection gave the Nevilles access to the ex-Percy manors of Wressle and Burwell, two- thirds of which had each been granted to Cromwell for life in February 1438, together with the reversion of the remainder. This grant was then converted into one in fee simple two years later, further reducing the likelihood of the Percys reclaiming it.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 325 Griffiths has calculated Burwell to have been worth an income of c. ¬£38 10s 6d per annum in 1456.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 326 n.24 These manors had been forfeited in 1403 by the first earl of Northumberland after the failure of the Percy Rebellion against Henry IV, and Cromwell's holding them in fee-simple meant they were available to him to grant away to whomever he liked.Payling, S. J., 'The Ampthill Dispute: A Study in Aristocratic Lawlessness and the Breakdown of Lancastrian Government' English Historical Review, 104 (1989), 895 Skirmish at Heworth Moor The earl of Salisbury's castle at Sheriff Hutton today This, the first actual confrontation (and 'most serious incident to date')Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 334 between the two families, in response to the marriage of Thomas Neville and Maud, a marriage which Griffiths has said must have been 'obnoxious' to the Percys, and particularly Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 325 This clash, on 24 August 1453, has been described as having the intention of 'the destruction of the entire Neville party' on the latter's way to the Neville stronghold of Sheriff Hutton Castle; it is, says Griffiths 'unclear' as to whether the Earl of Northumberland was party to Egremont's plans.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 329 Since only five members of the wedding party are ever named as being present by contemporary chroniclers, it is impossible to assess the strength of their force‚ÄîGriffiths suggests 'their retinues must have impressive.'Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 330 It has been suggested that the earl of Salisbury was personally targeted for attack by one Sir William Buckton, due to the fact that at the later indictments, his name was individually recorded as being contra comite Sarum in campo (‚Äòagainst the earl of Salisbury in the field‚Äô).Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 322 n.57 The prospect of Percy manors passing to the Neville family was too much for Lord Egremont, who spent days fiercely recruiting in York and ambushed the Nevilles on their way home to Sheriff Hutton. He no doubt intended to assassinate the Nevilles, but all of the family were there with their own retinues, so they probably had a larger force than Egremont expected (as earls, Salisbury and Warwick were entitled to at least a hundred soldiers each in their retinues). Still, the Percy force was almost certainly larger in size (though 710 names have been preserved, they probably numbered over a thousand). Mutual fear of fighting a pitched battle meant there was little if any bloodshed, and the Nevilles were able to retreat swiftly to their stronghold in Sheriff Hutton. There is an alternative view; the evidence for this is found on legal rolls and nowhere else. As not a soul is recorded as being injured in the skirmish, it is possible that the Nevilles used this incitement of violence as an excuse, an early example of a legal fiction, to take the matter to the royal courts, resolving the legal case and thereby stating whose land this skirmish took place on. This view has been suggested after studying the Kings Bench lists (now withdrawn from the public), where a number of skirmishes such as this are recorded but the only injuries or casualties found are a hen and occasionally a dog. Incidents and chronology 20 Oct 1453: The leaders of both Neville and Percy forces--Thomas and John Neville for the former, Egremont and Sir Richard Percy for the latter--converged respectively on their castles of Topcliffe and Sand Hutton in the North Riding. Significantly, they were, for the first time, accompanied by their fathers and elder brothers--Salisbury and Richard, Earl of Warwick accompanied John and Thomas, whilst the Percy brothers were with Northumberland and his elder brother Henry, Lord Poynings. However, the result of this near-confrontation appears to be unrecorded, says Griffiths.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 336-7 Griffiths has suggested that the conflict intensified after Christmas 1453, compared to the first few months.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 324 6 May 1454: Salisbury's house in York was broken into and his tenants attacked. Those who took part in this attack had mostly been with Egremont at Heworth. These men were also responsible for the sacking of Skipwith's York house a week later.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 343 Crown intervention On 12 July 1453, the king and council announced a commission of Oyer and Terminer, which was headed by the earls of Salisbury and Northumberland themselves. This was however, reformed two weeks later; Griffiths has speculated that this was probably because not only was it not big enough to deal with such a serious collapse in law and order, but also the commissioners themselves 'were not very effective.‚ÄôGriffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 327 Another weakness of this commission, he suggests, is the fact that it was composed with a number of Neville retainers; thus displaying a clear partisanship which would have been obvious to the Percys, and further reduce their faith in the crown's ability‚Äîor desire‚Äîto achieve a fair settlement.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 327 By 27 July, says Griffiths, the situation in the north had deteriorated so badly that the crown effectively abrogated its authority in the region, by writing directly to the two earls, laying responsibility for ending the dispute on them, and instructing them to keep their sons in order.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 327 It was at this point too, that the commission of Oyer and Terminer of 12 July was reissued; this time, without the presence of the earls, and with a much larger number of lawyers,Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991) 328 members included. The reissued commission was composed of Sir William Lucy of Northamptonshire, Peter Arden, John Portyngton, and Robert Danby, the latter three being lawyers and the former an uninvolved knight. The commission also expanded geographically into Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, ‚Äòand Yorkshire generally,‚Äô as opposed to the narrow remit of just York and environs as had the first one.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 328 Griffiths points to the fact that it actually found against at least four of John Neville's 'principle accomplices'- Sir John Conyers, Sir James Pickering, Sir Randolph, and Sir Thomas Mountford.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 327 The crown continued to write to the involved parties. On 8 October 1453, the council wrote to the earl of Westmorland and congratulated him on not assisting the Middleham branch. It also wrote again to Salisbury and Northumberland, ‚Äòmore in sorrow than in anger,‚Äô as Griffiths has phrased it, exhorting them to remember their positions of Commissioners of the Peace and also as members of the king‚Äôs council. At the same time, Parlt demanded that the nobility resolve their problems peaceably rather than in force. However, the king's letters 'concluded wearily‚Äô that both of them kept raising armed forces in spite of the appeals from king and parliament.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 335 Similar letters were sent to their involved younger sons using stronger terms, warning them that they could eventually suffer forfeiture.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 336 Griffiths has suggested that the crown was constrained in its attempts to suppress the law breaking because by now, the king had become incapacitated, and the council ruling in his stead were ill-able to afford alienating fellow magnates whose support might be required in government.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 336 Open warfare In retaliation, Sir John Neville raided the absent Earl of Northumberland's house at Catton, in Yorkshire, and all but ruined it. The next day, Richard Percy attacked a house on Neville property. The danger of civil war was intensified when both sides began summoning their retainers to strongholds in the north. On 20 October, the Percy clan had gathered 10,000 men at Topcliffe. Only four miles away, the Neville force was stationed at Sheriff Hutton. After several threats from the king, both sides reached a truce and disbanded their men. However, one chronicler said, \\"There was no reconciliation, the day of reckoning had merely been postponed.\\" Despite these precautions, it is probable that a few hundred men clashed at Stamford Bridge on 31 October or 1 November 1454, resulting in hundreds dead and more wounded. Lord Egremont was then captured and imprisoned by John Neville. York's protectorate Michael Hicks has described the roots of the Neville's alliance with Richard, Duke of York in 1453 as being based on their having 'common enemies'Hicks, M.A., English Political Culture in the Fifteenth Century (London, 2002), 105 (for instance, the king's chief minister, Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset) and that this association was significant enough to be 'a coalition of national significance.‚ÄôHicks, M.A., English Political Culture in the Fifteenth Century (London, 2002), 206 Griffiths notes that the parliament of 1453 failed to achieve any accord in the north, and that following the mental collapse of the king, York was made protector and Salisbury Chancellor; this, Griffiths suggests, presented Salisbury with an opportunity for revenge- which the earl took.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 342 Salisbury was now in an official position to write to Egremont and his father much more threateningly than the council had attempted the previous year. Northumberland was ordered to appear before the council by 12 June 1454, and his sons on 2 June.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 342 The rebellion of the Duke of Exeter During York's Protectorate, Somerset was imprisoned, and the Percys suffered greatly at the hands of the Nevilles. When the king recovered from his illness, York was relieved of power, and Somerset was released and was quick to ally himself with the Percys. Six months later, Henry VI, Somerset and the Percys (the Lancastrians) met the Duke of York and the Nevilles (the Yorkists) in the First Battle of St Albans, where the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Northumberland were slain. The battle of Stamford Bridge Stamford Bridge, one of the earl of Salisbury's manors, was on the old Roman Road east of York.Storey, R.L., The End of the House of Lancaster (London, 1966), 148-9 On 31 October 1454 (or, according to some accounts, 1 or 2 November) Egremont, and a short while later Richard Percy were captured by Sir Thomas Neville. Griffith's account describes there being hundreds killed and many wounded. It is likely that the Neville victory was made possible by the (to the Percys) treasonous flight of Peter Lound, the bailiff of their Pocklington manor, which was approximately two miles south of Stamford Bridge. The two Percy brothers taken to Middleham Castle and then transferred to the duke of York's custody.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 354 Aftermath and consequences The medieval prison of Newgate, where the Percy brothers were imprisoned and whence they escaped two years later. Following their defeat at Stamford Bridge, the Percy brothers were arraigned before a commission of Oyer and Terminer at York. This commission bound them over for massive sums; 8,000 marks payable to Salisbury, and including fines towards his countess and sons, to a total of 16,800 marks; Griffiths describes this as Salisbury's 'reckoning' of all the damage caused him estates during the course of the feud.Griffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 360 Griffiths has summarised the financial bonds that were intended to hold the peace together. Salisbury entered into a bond with the king for 12,000 marks on behalf of his sons Thomas and John (for being the principal Neville players). Conversely, Northumberland and his mother bound themselves for the same amount, ‚Äòfor all offences‚Äô against York and the Nevilles. Salisbury also agreed that Lord Egremont was to be released from the 16,800 mark bond he had been punished with in November 1454, and would also desist from taking any action against the Newgate sheriffs responsible for Egremont's escape. Egremont himself was then obligated in bond for 4,000 marks. This would have to be paid to Salisbury if he broke the peace towards the earl and his family for the next ten years. As Griffiths put, with these bonds, it was intended that ‚Äòthe slate was wiped clean.‚ÄôGriffiths, R.A., ‚ÄòLocal Rivalries and National Politics: the Percies, the Nevilles and the Duke of Exeter, 1452‚Äì55‚Äô in King and Country : England and Wales in the Fifteenth Century, (London 1991), 360 References External links * The Battle of Heworth Moor Category:Neville family Category:Wars of the Roses Category:Conflicts in 1454 ","title":"Percy‚ÄìNeville feud"},{"id":"1120237","text":"The County of Auxerre is a former state of current central France, with capital in Auxerre. History The first count attested by the sources is one Ermenaud, a companion of Charlemagne who reigned around 770. In 859 Charles the Bald handed over the county to his cousin Conrad II of Burgundy. When he revolted, the county was assigned to Robert the Strong. After the latter's death, Hugh the Abbot was count, but named a viscount in his lieu; later Auxerre was absorbed in Richard of Burgundy's dominion. . Count John IV sold it to the King of France in 1370. After the Treaty of Arras (1435) between Charles VII of France and Philip III of Burgundy, it returned once again to the latter.

Biography and career Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Wimbish started playing guitar at the age of 12 and switched to bass guitar at the age of 14. In 1979 he was hired together with guitarist Skip McDonald and drummer Keith LeBlanc to form the house rhythm section for Sugarhill Records. Although they did not play on the Sugarhill Gang's famous song \\"Rapper's Delight\\" (the rhythm tracks for this song were played by the group Positive Force), they did play on many other popular song tracks, including \\"The Message\\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, \\"White Lines\\" by Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel, \\"New York City\\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and \\"Apache\\" by the Sugarhill Gang. Wimbish with Living Colour, Vienna 1993 Wimbish with Little Axe (2009) Together with McDonald and LeBlanc, Wimbish headed to London in 1984 and started working with producer Adrian Sherwood and formed the group Tackhead. Together with Tackhead and as a session bassist, Wimbish found himself in demand as a bass player for many artists and was considered as a permanent sideman for the Rolling Stones after the departure of bassist Bill Wyman in 1993, but lost the position to Darryl Jones. In the late 1980s Wimbish began crossing paths with vocalist Bernard Fowler, who collaborated with Tackhead and Little Axe. Both sang on records by the Rolling Stones, and Wimbish later played on the Stones' 1997 album Bridges to Babylon. Wimbish joined Living Colour in 1992 (he replaced Muzz Skillings, who left the band) to tour and record the album, Stain. Living Colour disbanded in 1995, and Wimbish joined his old Sugarhill Gang partners to play in Little Axe, an ambient-dub project initiated by Skip 'Little Axe' MacDonald. After Living Colour disbanded, Wimbish went back to London to continue his career as a studio bassist. In 1999 he formed the drum and bass group Jungle Funk together with drummer Will Calhoun and percussionist/vocalist Vinx. Also in 1999, Wimbish solo album Trippy Notes for Bass was released. In 2000, Living Colour was re-formed and toured in the United States, South America and Europe. In 2001 and 2002 Wimbish recorded and played with rapper Mos Def in a band called BlackJack Johnson, which also featured members of P-Funk and Bad Brains in the lineup. Wimbish also formed Head Fake, a drum and bass project with drummer Will Calhoun. They released a CD, In The Area. In 2005 they started recording new songs. The recording took place in Brussels, Belgium and was followed by an extensive European tour. The CD has never been released. A Head>>Fake DVD was released in 2008. It features a recording of a Head>>Fake concert in Prague. In 2008 Wimbish, signed with Enja Records, and released his second solo album, CinemaSonics. In 2009, Living Colour released and toured for the album \\"The Chair in the Doorway\\". Wimbish was also featured on six Little Axe albums with Alan Glen on harmonica.

The extent of Messmer's role in the creation and popularity of Felix is a matter of ongoing dispute, particularly as he only laid his claim to the character after the death of Sullivan, who until that time had received the credit. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/messmer_o.htm Early life Messmer was born August 16, 1892 in West Hoboken, New Jersey (now Union City). He attended Holy Family Parochial School. He had a love of vaudeville and the entertainment industry instilled in him by his parents and teachers beginning at a young age. He attended the Thomas School of Art in New York City from 1911‚Äì1913, and participated in a work-study program with the Acme Agency, where he did illustrations for fashion catalogs.Rosero, Jessica (May 14, 2006). \\"Felix the Cat, created in Hudson County\\" The Union City Reporter. pp. 1 and 11. Career Messmer's first love, however, was cartooning. Inspired by Winsor McCay's animated films, such as How a Mosquito Operates, Messmer began creating his own comics for local newspapers in 1912, the same year he met Anne Mason, whom he married in 1934. One of his comics, Fun, ran as part of the Sunday comics' page for New York World. Messmer signed a deal with Jack Cohn of Universal Studios in 1915 to produce a test film of a character Messmer created called \\"Motor Mat\\". It was never released, but drew the interest of animator Pat Sullivan, though Messmer instead decided to go to work with Henry \\"Hy\\" Mayer, a well-known cartoonist. Mayer and Messmer collaborated on the successful animated series The Travels of Teddy, which was based on the life of Teddy Roosevelt. Messmer would subsequently work for Sullivan, who handled the business side of the work, with Messmer handling creative responsibilities. When Sullivan served a nine-month prison sentence in 1917, Messmer briefly returned to work with Mayer, until Messmer was drafted into World War I. When Messmer returned to the United States in 1919, he returned to Sullivan's studio, which was hired by director Earl Hurd of Paramount Screen Magazine for a cartoon short that would accompany a feature film. Sullivan gave the project to Messmer, whose end result, Feline Follies, starred Master Tom, a black cat, who was a prototype to Felix, which brought good luck to people in trouble. Sullivan's involvement in the project is disputed, although handwriting in the animation has been identified as his.http://www.vixenmagazine.com/News.htmlA card by Pat Sullivan to Sir Hubert Wilkins (offering the best of wishes in his attempt to sail a submarine under the ice to the North Pole) was used as one of the matches for Sullivan's handwriting In addition to Sullivans handwriting in 'Feline Follies', the Australian term for mother 'MUM' is used in a speech bubble of one of the kittens at the 4:00 mark of 'Feline Follies'. Felix was the first cartoon character created and developed for the screen, as well as the first to become a licensed, mass merchandised character. Sullivan took the credit for Felix, and though Messmer directed and was the lead animator on all of the episodes he appeared in, Sullivan's name was the only onscreen credit that appeared in them. Messmer also oversaw the direction of the Felix newspaper strip, doing most of the pencils and inks on the strip until 1954. Felix the Cat starred in over 150 cartoons until 1931, when animation studios began converting to sound films. The newspaper strip's popularity began to fade in the late 1930s, though the character was reintroduced to new fans via comic books in the 1940s. Messmer then teamed with Douglas Leigh on the large moving electronic signs that lit up Times Square. Messmer also produced more Felix comic books in the 1940s and 1950s for companies such as Dell Comics, Toby Press, and Harvey Comics, as well as doing animation for the Paramount studios (Several Popeye cartoons carry his credit). By the 1960s, Felix had been reinvented for television, and Messmer's longtime assistant Joe Oriolo (the creator of Casper the Friendly Ghost) made sure that Messmer was finally credited as the creator of Felix the Cat. Messmer continued working on the character for the rest of his life. Death and legacy Messmer died at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey on October 28, 1983, aged 91. Today, Felix the Cat is run in syndication in over 250 newspapers all over the world.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/obituaries/otto-messmer-is-dead- at-91-created-felix-the-cat-flims.html Notes References *Mavromatis, Kally; \\"Felix the Cat ‚Äì Silent Star of April 1999\\", accessed April 5, 2007. *Gordon, Ian.

Shutter priority (usually denoted as S on the mode dial), also called time value (abbreviated as Tv), refers to a setting on some cameras that allows the user to choose a specific shutter speed while the camera adjusts the aperture to ensure correct exposure. This is different from manual mode, where the user must decide both values, aperture priority where the user picks an aperture with the camera selecting the shutter speed to match, or program mode where the camera selects both. Background Shutter priority with longer exposures is chosen to create an impression of motion. For example, a waterfall will appear blurred and fuzzy. If the camera is panned with a moving subject, the background will appear blurred. When photographing sports or high-speed phenomena, shutter priority with short exposures can ensure that the motion is effectively frozen in the resulting image.

Belushi loved Fear and was their biggest booster; the two became good friends and cocaine abusers; this period is well documented in the Bob Woodward book Wired: The Short Life And Fast Times Of John Belushi, a biography of the comedy actor. Belushi got Fear a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live that essentially ended in a semi-planned melee, an appearance that is often cited as the origin of moshing. After their Saturday Night Live appearance, they recorded their debut album The Record, now a classic punk album. The Record was the first of its kind and sets itself apart from other punk recordings of that era, in that the production value was incredibly high for this type of recording. The album was recorded and engineered at the same studio that Fleetwood Mac was recording at and was given the same attention and technical talent that was given to this major super group. Scratch not only played bass on most of the record, he played saxophone on the song \\"New York's Alright If You Like Saxophones\\" (while lead singer Lee Ving played bass, as they had been doing the song live). Scratch also co-wrote one song with Ving on the album, \\"Fresh Flesh\\", and wrote and sang lead vocal on another, \\"Getting The Brush\\" which was about his struggle to get his songs put on the album the Record, Derf claimed that Lee would use up all the record space with his songs as 70% of the publishing and royalty proceeds went to the writer of the song, leaving only 30% to split with the rest of the band members. Scratch was also seen with the band in the movie The Decline of Western Civilization and on an episode of Casey Kasem's syndicated America's Top 10 TV show where his band took first place receiving a \\"Gong\\" trophy. Fear hung on until the mid-1980s, eventually breaking up due to the death of the Hollywood punk scene and Ving's increasing interest in acting and performing country music. Lee's unwillingness to share the publishing rights by allowing other members to contribute their songs on any recordings was also a huge source of dissent among the band members. During the punk revival generated by Nirvana in the 1990s, vocalist Lee Ving did one final performance with the original lineup of Fear before putting together a new version of Fear containing no original members other than himself. Lee instead decided to use unknown \\"hired guns\\" to perform and record with Fear in order to maintain all the publishing rights and keep the royalties. Scratch, wishing to concentrate on guitar and saxophone, sold the Fender bass he used on The Record to then- Minutemen bassist Mike Watt. Watt played the instrument on another future punk classic, the 1982 release What Makes A Man Start Fires? His surviving instruments and the saxophone used on the New York's Alright\\" recording are now in possession of his wife Tammy. Scratch later resurfaced in several other groups, including groups such as the eponymous Scratch which released a record in Belgium with very limited sales and included the song \\"About Me\\" https://myspace.com/derfscratch a fine example of Derf's clever song writing, Derf Scratch and Friends, and The Werewolfs (which also featured Butch Patrick who played as the son in the TV show The Munsters). As a member of The Werewolfs, Scratch was seriously injured in a car accident after a show in Los Angeles. During the last 5 years of Derf's life he developed an interest in art, he began painting in 1994 alongside of his wife Tammy who was an artist creating original jewelry pieces that she sold under the name Rita Blackwood. Derf produced a series of \\"Legs\\" works which he was planning to exhibit, he continued painting up until his death, his wife Tammy is in possession of these works. Scratch died on July 28, 2010 from liver disease. He was 58 years old. He is survived by his wife of fourteen years, Tammy. Personal life The nickname Derf was actually given to him by his parents when he was a child, it is simply Fred spelled backwards, he carried the name practically all his life. Derf was ostracized from the Saturday Night Live cast as it was suspected that he contributed to John Belushi's death by giving him his first taste of heroin. To make matters worse Derf did an interview with Bob Woodward for the book \\"Wired\\" in which he exposed a lot of the rampant drug use in John's circle of friends. On the night John Belushi died, Derf claimed he was looking for John who was late for a Blues Brother's rehearsal which Derf was to attend for the first time as the new bass player. Scratch met his wife Tammy in 1992 who at the time called herself \\"Rita Blackwood\\". They married in 1996. She was a member of Derf Scratch and Friends who played keyboards and sang vocals Scratch was a real estate agent who had passed his test during his early days with Fear. He shared a desk with his parents at the realtor and would tell them he was going to look for properties, but would go to Lee Ving's place to brainstorm ideas for the band.

She was later transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Columbia, as a .  Construction and career  United States Navy Named for Jonathan Haraden, she was launched by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Miss Mabel B. Stephens, great-niece of Captain Jonathan Haraden. Haraden was commissioned at Norfolk Navy Yard on 7 June 1919, to Lieutenant Commander R. H. Booth in command. Haraden was assigned to U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters; after calling at Newport, Rhode Island for supplies she departed New York 30 June 1919 for duty in the Adriatic Sea. She arrived at Split, (then Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, now Croatia), on 28 July 1919 and conducted operations from that port assisting the naval force in the execution of the terms of the Austrian armistice, serving as station ship at Trieste and Rijeka, and participating in maneuvers. This duty occupied her until 23 October 1919, when she departed for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 18 November. The destroyer departed Norfolk on 7 April 1920 for Charleston, South Carolina, and operated with reserve destroyer divisions out of Charleston until 15 March 1921. After an extensive overhaul at New York, ending on 2 May, Haraden sailed for Newport and training operations off New England. She returned to Charleston on 12 October 1921 and to Philadelphia on 10 April 1922. Haraden decommissioned 17 July 1922. With the mounting tensions in 1939, Haraden was called back to active service and recommissioned at Philadelphia 4 December 1939. After shakedown training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the destroyer performed neutrality patrol in Cuban waters briefly and then returned to Newport, 6 March 1940. She subsequently conducted neutrality patrol in waters off Block Island and Nantucket Shoals, and made three training cruises in Chesapeake Bay. Arriving Boston Navy Yard 7 September 1940, Haraden was one of the fifty over-age destroyers to be sent to the United Kingdom in exchange for bases. She sailed on 18 September for Halifax, Nova Scotia, and decommissioned there for transfer to the British on 24 September 1940. Her name was struck from the Navy List 8 January 1941. Royal Canadian Navy Assigned to Canada and renamed HMCS Columbia following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), after the Columbia River originating in British Columbia and flowing into Washington and thence along the Oregon border.Milner 1985 p.23 Columbia first underwent refit and then was assigned to convoy duties in the Atlantic. Her first major action began 15 October 1941 when she joined convoy SC 8, already under submarine attack. Columbia, and the other escorts fought valiantly, but nine merchantmen from the convoy were sunk before reaching England. After the U.S.'s entry into the war Columbia was reassigned to convoy ships from New York to St. Johns, Newfoundland, the first leg of the transatlantic journey. She escorted convoys and performed anti-submarine patrol until 25 February 1944, when she struck a cliff in foul weather off the coast of Newfoundland. Columbia was not fully repaired after the accident but made watertight and used as a fuel and ammunition hulk in Nova Scotia until her return to the War Assets Administration for disposal in August 1945 when she was sold for scrapping.

Reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field of the image. In the case of film cameras, this allows less light to reach the film plane ‚Äì to achieve the same exposure after stopping down, it is necessary to compensate for the reduced light by either increasing the exposure time, or using a photographic film with a higher speed. In the case of digital cameras, stopping down the aperture allows less light to reach the image sensor ‚Äì to achieve the same exposure, it is necessary to compensate for the reduced light by either increasing the exposure time, or increasing the signal gain of the sensor by increasing the camera's ISO setting. Alternatively, more light can be added to the scene by increasing the amount of light illuminating the scene, such as by using or increasing the strength of electronic flash or other light sources. As a lens is stopped down from its maximum (widest) aperture, most lens aberrations (spherical aberration, coma and astigmatism) are decreased, but lens diffraction increases. The effect is that for most lenses, the balance between the decreasing aberrations and the increasing diffraction effects of stopping down the lens means that lenses have an optimum aperture for best results, often about three stops closed down from maximum aperture, so for a lens with a maximum aperture of ∆í/2.8, ∆í/8 would be the optimum aperture.

He was best known for the compositions he penned for the film Black Orpheus. Biography Luiz Floriano Bonf√° was born on October 17, 1922, in Rio de Janeiro. He studied in Rio with Uruguayan classical guitarist Isa√≠as S√°vio from the age of 11. These weekly lessons entailed a long, harsh commute by train (2 1/2 hours one way) and on foot from his family home in Santa Cruz, the western rural outskirts of Rio de Janeiro to the teacher's home in the hills of Santa Teresa. Given Bonf√°'s extraordinary dedication and talent for the guitar, S√°vio excused the youngster's inability to pay for his lessons. Bonf√° first gained widespread exposure in Brazil in 1947 when he was featured on Rio's R√°dio Nacional, then an important showcase for up-and-coming talent. He was a member of the vocal group Quitandinha Serenaders in the late 1940s. Some of his first compositions such as \\"Ranchinho de Palha\\", \\"O Vento N√£o Sabe\\", were recorded and performed by Brazilian crooner Dick Farney in the 1950s. Bonf√°'s first hit song was \\"De Cigarro em Cigarro\\" recorded by Nora Ney in 1957. It was through Farney that Bonf√° was introduced to Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, the leading songwriting team behind the worldwide explosion of the great Bossa Nova in the late 1950s to 1970s, becoming a fever in the US. Bonf√° collaborated with them and with other prominent Brazilian musicians and artists in productions of de Moraes' anthological play Orfeu da Concei√ß√£o, which several years later gave origin to Marcel Camus' film Black Orpheus (Orfeu Negro in Portuguese). In the burgeoning days of Rio de Janeiro's thriving jazz scene, it was commonplace for musicians, artists, and dramatists to collaborate in such theatrical presentations. Bonf√° wrote some of the original music featured in the film, including the numbers \\"Samba de Orfeu\\" and his most famous composition, \\"Manh√£ de Carnaval\\" (of which Carl Sigman later wrote a different set of English lyrics titled \\"A Day in the Life of a Fool\\"), which has been among the top ten standards played worldwide, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. As a composer and performer, Bonf√° was at heart an exponent of the bold, lyrical, lushly orchestrated, and emotionally charged samba-can√ß√£o style that predated the arrival of Jo√£o Gilberto's more refined and subdued bossa nova style. Jobim, Jo√£o Donato, Dorival Caymmi, and other contemporaries were also essentially samba-can√ß√£o musicians until the sudden, massive popularity of the young Gilberto's unique style of guitar playing and expressively muted vocals transformed the music of the day into the music of the future. Camus' film and Gilberto's and Jobim's collaborations with American jazzmen such as Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd did much to bring Brazilian popular music to the attention of the world, and Bonf√° became a highly visible ambassador of Brazilian music in the United States beginning with the famous November 1962 Bossa Nova concert at New York's Carnegie Hall. Bonf√° worked with American musicians such as Quincy Jones, George Benson, Stan Getz, and Frank Sinatra, recording several albums while in U.S. Elvis Presley sang a Bonf√° composition, \\"Almost in Love\\" with lyrics by Randy Starr in the 1968 MGM film Live a Little, Love a Little. Also of note is his \\"The Gentle Rain\\", with lyrics by Matt Dubey, and \\"Sambolero\\". Bonf√° died of prostate cancer at 78 in Rio de Janeiro on January 12, 2001. Legacy In 2005, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings released an album of Bonf√°'s work, entitled Solo in Rio 1959, which included previously unreleased material from the original recording session. In 2008, Universal Music France released a coffee table book containing two CDs which included previously unreleased material of the Black Orpheus soundtrack, and a DVD. Also in 2008, Universal Music released The Brazilian Scene, Braziliana and Black Orpheus celebrating the 50th anniversary of the bossa nova. Bonf√°'s major legacy continues to be his compositions from the Black Orpheus soundtrack, most notably the instantly recognizable bossa nova classic \\"Manh√£ de Carnaval\\". But Bonf√°'s discography also attests to his uniquely inventive mastery of Brazilian jazz guitar. Bonf√°'s guitar style was brassier and more penetrating than that of his major contemporary, Jo√£o Gilberto, and Bonf√° was a frequent and adept soloist whereas Gilberto plays his own suave, intricate brand of rhythm guitar almost exclusively. Bonf√° often played solo guitar in a polyphonic style, harmonizing melody lines in a manner similar to that made famous by Wes Montgomery in the US, or playing lead and rhythm parts simultaneously. As a composer and as a guitarist, Bonf√° played a pivotal role in bridging the incumbent samba-can√ß√£o style with the innovations of the bossa nova movement. Bonfa's instrumental \\"Seville\\" from his 1967 LP Luiz Bonfa Plays Great Songs is the basis for the 2011 hit \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" by Belgian-Australian musician Gotye. Gotye's song charted No. 1 in 27 countries.

Sports  Soccer, ice hockey, golf, open- air swimming pool, indoor swimming pool, horse sports, handball.  Industry  Eschweiler (or Weisweiler) isn't too remarkable with industries. Chemicals and goods are the main products, while it also has a lignite-powered power plant rated at 2.8 GW.  Science  The lignite (brown coal) deposits in the region are former Miocene swamp forest dominated by Castanopsis, a type of chinkapin. Such plants do not occur naturally in Europe. A type of fossil wood has been described from logs found in Eschweiler mines. It was named Castanoxylon eschweilerense in reference to the town; the name would translate as \\"Eschweiler chinkapin wood\\", as it probably belonged to Castanopsis but perhaps to some other genus of chinkapin.  Transport  Eschweiler has six railway stations: Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof (central station), Eschweiler-Aue (from 2009), Eschweiler-West, Eschweiler-Talbahnhof, Eschweiler-Nothberg, Eschweiler-Weisweiler and Nothberg (till 2009). Eschweiler-St. J√∂ris is planned. Eschweiler has two bus terminals and bus lines in every quarter and in its whole vicinity. Autobahn exits on the A 4 include Eschweiler-West, Eschweiler-Ost and Weisweiler. The city can be reached also by three exits on the A 44: Aldenhoven, Alsdorf and Broichweiden.

Sinclair Stevenson) Murther and Walking Spirits, first published by McClelland and Stewart in 1991, is a novel by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. Murther and Walking Spirits is, in a way, another ghost story, a genre Davies visited in his short story collection High Spirits (1982). In the very first sentence of the novel, \\"Gil\\" Gilmartin, the protagonist and narrator, is a film critic who comes home to find his attractive wife having an affair with a nerdy coworker, who strikes him with a walking stick in fear, causing his death. His ghost then attends a strange film festival. While the attendees see actual films, Gilmartin is shown \\"films\\" detailing the lives of his ancestors, such as one who was a Tory during the American Revolution or another who was a master carpenter who married a blue-blooded woman, only to have it end in a nasty divorce. The films, dealing as they do with more and more recent subjects, bring the novel to its modern-day conclusion. Gilmartin's ghost is able to cross over when his killer confesses to the newspaper editor, who chides him for the sin, but also for society in general: \\"It's a hot dinner for the wrongdoer and the victims struggle\\". Rather than surrender the killer to the authorities, the editor says his punishment should be to carry that walking stick for the rest of his life, akin to a \\"mark of Cain\\". Gilmartin also learns that prior to his death, he had impregnated his wife, and his ancestors' tribulations may have been shown to him as a sign the bloodline will continue. Davies used his own ancestry -- Welsh and United Empire Loyalist -- as inspiration for the \\"films\\" presented. The novel is prefaced with a quote from Samuel Butler: \\"But where Murthers and Walking Spirits meet, there is no other Narrative can come near it.\\" (The word \\"murther\\" is an archaic spelling of \\"murder\\".) Murther and Walking Spirits was not well received by the critics, and sales of the book were disappointing, compared to Davies' previous works. Unlike Davies' previous novels, Murther and Walking Spirits was not part of a trilogy. There is some supposition, however, that had Davies lived long enough this novel and his next novel, The Cunning Man, might have constituted another trilogy. In fact, in his introduction to The Merry Heart (1996), a collection of Davies' writings published posthumously, Davies' publisher, Douglas M. Gibson, tells how Davies had been researching and preparing the novel which would have followed The Cunning Man and would have been the third in the series. Gibson speculated that this unfinished trilogy might have been called the \\"Toronto Trilogy\\".

The term comes from a Greek word for \\"wind\\" or \\"breath\\" (œÄŒΩŒµ·ø¶ŒºŒ±).  Comparison with firearms  In theory, pneumatic weapons have certain advantages over traditional firearms: *The ammunition can be much simpler (and thus more compact and lighter for the same payload), because there is no need for a propellant or casing; the entire round becomes the projectile. *Since no propellant is fired, there is no chemical residue to accumulate in the barrel or chamber. *Because there is no casing to eject, it is theoretically possible to have a higher rate of repeat fire. *The barrel is not heated to nearly the same extent as with a firearm. In practice, pneumatic weapons are not as well- developed as traditional firearms and have a number of practical deficiencies: *The weapon has to supply or be supplied with a source of very high pressure air, such as a reservoir or compressor, which adds substantial complexity and weight to the weapon. *The action, or the mechanism by which subsequent rounds are automatically reloaded, must also be powered by the air pressure; many modern firearms re-use the energy from the propellant to accomplish this (see gas-operated reloading), further reducing the amount of work the weapon itself has to do.  Pneumatic weapons in the toy industry  The low projectile speed requirement of a toy weapon greatly reduces the amount of air pressure needed; combined with the importance of safety in the toy industry, this has led to widespread adoption of pneumatic firing mechanisms in toy weapons, where a propellant reaction is not appropriate (although other technologies, such as rubber bands, can be used). The toy industry has produced a number of pneumatic toy weapons, which fire small, lightweight (often plastic and frequently hollow) projectiles at relatively low speeds. Airsoft and paintball guns are a popular toy that operates this way; when used with adequate safety equipment (eye protection at a minimum) these may be used in games involving shooting at other players. BB guns and other low powered air guns are often marketed towards the youth market. While a lethal wound is unlikely due to their low power, the steel and lead projectiles they fire can readily penetrate the skin. Gun safety rules should be followed when using air guns and BB guns.

It will be the first robot arm able to work on the Russian space station segments, and will supplement the two Russian Strela cargo cranes that are already installed on the Pirs module. The ERA is designed and assembled by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands (formerly Dutch Space).  Major features and tasks  The ERA has several interesting features. Most prominent are its ability to 'walk' around the exterior of the Russian segments of the station under its own control, moving hand-over-hand between pre-fixed basepoints, and its ability to perform many tasks automatically or semi-automatically, thereby freeing its operators to do other work. Specific tasks of ERA include: * Installation and deployment of solar arrays * Replacement of solar arrays * Inspection of the station * Handling of (external) payloads * Support of astronauts during space walks The International Space Station already features three robotic arms, the first being the Canadarm2, but because the Russian grapple fixtures are different, that arm and Dextre can only be used on the Zarya module of the Russian segment. The third arm is fixed on the Japanese Experiment Module, the Remote Manipulator System (JEM-RMS) uses a similar grapple fixture to Canadarm2. Because all Russian and European spacecraft dock automatically there is no need to manipulate spacecraft on the Russian segment so the European arm is half the length and less powerful than Canadarm2. Developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a number of European space companies, with Dutch Space as prime contractor and subcontractors in 8 countries, the robot arm will be launched by a Proton rocket, along with Nauka, in 2021, to be put to work in space by the ISS crew. In 2010, a spare elbow joint for the arm was launched preemptively, attached to the Mini-Research Module 1 (MRM-1). The MLM will also serve as home base for ERA; originally, the arm was going to be attached to the cancelled Science Power Platform which would have had eight solar arrays. Control of ERA Control and data interfaces of ERA Astronauts can control the robot from both inside and outside the space station. Control from inside the space station (Intra Vehicular Activity-Man Machine Interface (IVA- MMI)) uses a laptop, which shows a model of the ERA and its surroundings. Control from outside the space station (Extra Vehicular Activity-Man Machine Interface (EVA-MMI)) uses a specially-designed interface that can be used while in a spacesuit.

Both Thomas and Antony were educated at Oxford University, where they studied from 1267 to 1270. Having entered the clergy, Bek received several benefices and soon attracted the attention of the Lord Edward, the heir of King Henry III of England. He was Archdeacon of Durham by 1275, as well as precentor of York and held prebends at Lichfield, London, and Wells.Greenway \\"Archdeacons of Durham diocese: Durham\\" Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300 pp. 37‚Äì39 Bek accompanied Edward when the prince went on Crusade in 1270.Prestwich Edward I p. 69 When Edward returned from crusading, he appointed Bek to the office of Keeper of the wardrobe on 21 September 1274,Prestwich Edward I p. 92 but Bek held the office for only about a month, and was replaced in October with his brother Thomas Bek.Fryde Handbook of British Chronology p. 79 Edward named Bek the constable of the Tower of London in 1275. In November 1277 Bek was one of the councillors sent by Edward to negotiate with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. The result was the Treaty of Aberconwy which required Llywelyn to give up hostages, pay a large fine, give up claims to some lands and pay homage to King Edward.Prestwich Edward I p. 180 Bek was also sent to Aragon to negotiate the marriage of Edward's daughter Eleanor to the heir of Aragon, Alfonso.Prestwich Edward I p. 321 Bishop of Durham Edward I secured Bek's election as bishop of Durham in 1283. He was elected on 9 July 1283 and consecrated on 9 January 1284.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 242 During his consecration, Bek had the remains of Saint William of York moved to a new shrine in York Minster. Bek was enthroned at Durham Cathedral on 25 December 1285.Greenway \\"Durham: Bishops\\" Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae pp. 29‚Äì32 Bek was sent to Scotland after the death of King Alexander III of Scotland in 1286, to act on Edward's behalf for Alexander's heir Margaret of Norway, who was bethrothed to Edward's son Prince Edward.Prestwich Plantagenet England p. 231 However, Margaret died soon after this, and Edward was brought in to decide the succession of the Scottish throne.Prestwich Edward I p. 369‚Äì370 Bek was employed by King Edward in the negotiations and also served as a spokesman. In November 1292, Edward decided in favor of John Balliol, and Bek assisted in the enthronement of Balliol at Scone soon after. Service for Edward I In 1293, Bek was excommunicated by the Archbishop of York because Bek had allowed the king's officers to arrest two clerks while Bek was in Scotland on a royal mission. In response, a legal case was brought against the archbishop in Parliament alleging that because Bek was acting as the king's officer at the time, he wasn't acting as bishop but as earl palatine, and thus the excommunication was actually an affront to the royal dignity. Before the case could be decided, the archbishop yielded and was fined.Prestwich Edward I p. 352 In 1294 the king sent Bek, along with others, on a diplomatic errand to the German king Adolf of Nassau and the archbishop of Cologne. The embassy was attempting to secure allies for Edward's war against King Philip IV of France.Prestwich Edward I p. 386 The second phase of the Battle of Falkirk Taking part in Edward's campaigns in Scotland, the bishop received the surrender of King John I of Scotland at Brechin in 1296, and led one division of the English army at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298.Rose Kings in the North p. 154 During the Falkirk campaign, but before the battle itself, a section of the army under Bek captured Dirleton Castle. In 1300, soon after his return to England, Bek became involved in a quarrel with Richard de Hoton, Prior of Durham and the cathedral chapter. Both Hoton and the chapter were attempting to assert their independence from oversight by the bishop. Bek deposed and excommunicated the prior, and locked the cathedral and the priory up. Appeals from both sides were made to the king, but the prior had previously secured the support of several of the king's advisors. Attempts to secure a negotiated settlement failed, and other disputes over lands and rights escalated the dispute. At sometime after 1301 the king confiscated the lands of the bishop. A settlement in 1303 which restored the bishop's lands, did not settle the dispute between the prior and the bishop. In 1304, further charges were brought against the bishop by the prior and the cathedral chapter, including a serious one of imprisoning a royal messenger. The issue of the messenger led to the lands of the bishop once more being confiscated in 1305. The bishop secured the support of Pope Clement VPrestwich Edward I p. 541‚Äì545 who named Bek Patriarch of Jerusalem on 26 February 1306. Further actions against the bishop were stopped by the death of the king in 1307. Service under Edward II Bek conducted the funeral service for King Edward I on 27 October 1307 at Westminster Abbey.Prestwich Edward I p. 558 In September, shortly after the death of Edward I, Edward II restored Bek's lands and rights. Bek's title of patriarch made him the senior ecclesiastic in England, and it was probably due to that status that he was named the main investigator of the Templars in 1308. In 1309, he finally managed to visit the priory at Durham, and the new prior announced that he and the chapter would not institute any more legal proceedings against the bishop stemming from the dispute. Death and legacy The bishop died at Eltham Palace near London on 3 March 1311. He was buried on 3 May 1311 in Durham Cathedral. Bek served as an important advisor to King Edward I throughout most of his term as bishop, only losing that status at the end of Edward's reign due to the dispute with the Durham prior.Prestwich Edward I p. 437 His extravagance was legendary, and his retinue was large, and consisted of 140 knights.Moorman Church Life p. 175 footnote1 Bek was a wealthy man, and his personal estate at his death was valued at 6000 marks. He built at Auckland Castle,Pettifer English Castles p. 25 Somerton Castle in LincolnshirePettifer English Castles p. 144 and elsewhere. He also built Durham Castle's Great Hall.Pettifer English Castles p. 29 Some efforts were made after the bishop's death to have him canonized, but nothing came of these efforts. Bek was known for his chastity and bravery also. Bek's elder brother, Thomas Bek was Bishop of St David's and a trusted servant of Edward I.

She was built from 1853 to 1854 at Sakurajima in what is now Kagoshima Prefecture. Sh≈çhei Maru should not be confused with the World War II passenger/cargo vessel of the same name, sunk by the submarine off of Korea. Background Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa shogunate ruling Japan pursued a policy of isolating the country from outside influences. Foreign trade was maintained only with the Dutch and the Chinese and was conducted exclusively at Nagasaki under a strict government monopoly. No foreigners were allowed to set foot in Japan, and no Japanese was permitted to travel abroad.W. G. Beasley, The Meiji Restoration, p.74-77 In June 1635 a law was proclaimed prohibiting the construction of large, ocean-capable vessels. However, by the early nineteenth century, this policy of isolation was increasingly under challenge. In 1846, an official American expedition led by Commodore James Biddle on an official mission with two ships, including one warship armed with 72 cannons, asking for ports to be opened for trade, but his requests for a trade agreement were refused.W. G. Beasley, The Meiji Restoration, p.78 Following the July 1853 visit of Commodore Perry, and intense debate erupted within the Japanese government on how to handle the unprecedented threat to the nation‚Äôs capital, and the only universal consensus was that steps be taken immediately to bolster Japan‚Äôs coastal defenses. The law forbidding construction of large vessels was repealed, and many of the feudal domains took immediate steps to construct or purchase warships. These included the H≈ç≈ç Maru constructed by the Uraga bugy≈ç office, and the Asahi Maru constructed by Mito Domain. Citing the need to protect Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, Satsuma daimy≈ç Shimazu Nariakira successfully petitioned the Tokugawa shogunate to lift the prohibition on the construction of large ocean-going vessels in December 1852. A shipyard was constructed on Sakurajima and the new vessel was launched in May 1853 even before the visit July 1853 visit of Commodore Perry, and his fleet of \\"Black Ships\\" to Edo Bay. Sh≈çhei Maru took longer to complete than was anticipated, and was commissioned on December 12, 1854, almost six months after H≈ç≈ç Maru was completed. Design Sh≈çhei Maru was a three-masted barque-rigged sailing vessel, with an overall length of , beam of , and displacement of 370 tons. Of wooden construction, she was depicted in contemporary artwork as being armed with five cannon on each beam. Her sails had black bands, characteristic of Tokugawa naval vessels. She was depicted in an 1855 print as flying the rising sun flag. The new ship was apparently built using manuals obtained from the Netherlands via the trading outpost of Dejima, and occasional observations of foreign vessels roaming the waters off Japan. Nakahama Manjir≈ç may have contributed to its design from his personal experiences, but this is uncertain. Service record Sh≈çhei Maru was transferred to Edo in February 1855 and commissioned into the Tokugawa shogunate navy in August 1855. It was later assigned to the Nagasaki Naval Training Center as a training vessel. Following the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, Sh≈çhei Maru was seized by the new Meiji government, but was considered too obsolete for use by the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy and was assigned to the Colonization Ministry together with the Kanrin Maru and as a transport for the development of the northern island of Hokkaid≈ç. She was wrecked after she ran aground on a sandbar off what is now Kaminokuni, Hokkaid≈ç () after a storm on 2 March 1870.

The Cunning Man is the memoir of the life of a doctor, Dr. Jonathan Hullah, living in Toronto. Hullah is a holistic physician -- a cunning diagnostician who can often get to the root of problems that have baffled others. A young journalist's query about the circumstances surrounding an Anglican priest's death at the high altar on Good Friday leads Hullah to reflect on his own life and career.

A fictionalised version of Toronto's Church of St. Mary Magdalene features prominently. Unlike most of Davies' previous novels, The Cunning Man was not part of a trilogy.

He began his royal service in the government of Henry II, serving as a vice-chancellor. He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively canon of Rouen Cathedral, treasurer of Rouen, and archdeacon of Oxford. King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was translated to Rouen in late 1184. When Richard I, King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the Third Crusade, but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between William Longchamp, the justiciar whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince John, Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194. Coutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of Andely manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the castle of Gaillard on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King Philip II of France. Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.

Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.Turner \\"Changing Perceptions\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law p. 241 Coutances was usually given the title of magister, which signified that he had received an education in a school; most likely he attended the schools of Paris. Gerald of Wales said that Coutances was dedicated to learning, and considered him to be a talented courtier. Service to King Henry Coutances started his career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber.Lyon Constitutional History p. 266 He probably owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.Peltzer \\"Henry II and the Norman Bishops\\" English Historical Review pp. 1222‚Äì1225 By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral.

Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there.Joliffe Angevin Kingship p. 208 footnote 4 This happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, it does not appear that the attempt was a sustained one.Schriber Dilemma of Arnulf of Lisieux pp. 118‚Äì119 On his return to England, Coutances was given custody of the abbeys of Wilton and Ramsey, which were being held by King Henry pending the election of new abbots. He thus acquired the right to collect the abbeys' revenues in the name of the king, who had the regalian rights to that income.Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases p. 237 In 1180 Henry sent Coutances to France on another diplomatic mission. In February 1182 Coutances witnessed King Henry II's will, made before the king travelled to Normandy.Warren Henry II p. 559 and footnote 4 Bishop of Lincoln and Archbishop of Rouen Coutances was elected to the see of Lincoln on 8 May 1183, selected by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183Fryde, et. al Handbook of British Chronology p. 255 at Angers by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was enthroned at Lincoln Cathedral on 11 December 1183.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops of Lincoln While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering its resources. Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell.Scammell Hugh du Puiset p. 70 On 17 November 1184 Coutances was translated to the diocese of Rouen, becoming Archbishop of Rouen. The original election to Rouen had taken place in the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the see there was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status. The medieval chronicler William of Newburgh wrote that eventually Coutances' ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation. He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185. Coutances remained in Henry's service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10 years of Henry's reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only William de Humez, the constable, equalled the 16 charters that Coutances witnessed.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law p. 181 footnote 4 In the later part of 1186, after the death of King Henry's son Geoffrey‚Äîwho was Duke of Brittany‚ÄîKing Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be surrendered into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle for a temporary truce.Warren Henry II p. 610 In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France. At Whitsun in 1189, Coutances was a member of a commission appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister Alice, that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.Gillingham Richard I pp. 94‚Äì98 Service to King Richard Shortly after Richard took the throne he sought absolution for his sins in rebelling against his father, from Baldwin of Forde and Coutances. The two archbishops absolved Richard in a ceremony in Sees.Gillingham Richard I p. 104 Coutances also invested Richard as Duke of Normandy in a ceremony held in Rouen, before accompanying Richard to England, where he participated in the new king's coronation, on 3 September 1189.Fryde, et. al Handbook of British Chronology p. 36 In 1189 Coutances held an ecclesiastical synod which legislated, among other things, that the clergy should not hold secular offices, even though Coutances himself had held and continued to hold such offices.Turner \\"Clerical Judges\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law p. 163 On 9 November 1189 Richard appointed Coutances to a commission tasked with deciding the dispute between Baldwin of Forde and the monks of his cathedral chapter over Baldwin's plan to create a church dedicated to Thomas Becket, the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury, and to staff this church not with monks, but with canons.Young Hubert Walter pp. 31‚Äì32 The monks of Canterbury Cathedral objected to Baldwin's plan, fearing that it was part of a plot to transfer the right of election from the monastic cathedral chapter to the new church's canons.Young Hubert Walter p. 13 Sitting on the commission with Coutances were Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Godfrey de Lucy, the Bishop of Winchester, Hubert Walter, the Bishop of Salisbury, Peter de Leia, the Bishop of St David's, Richard fitzNigel, the Bishop-elect of London, William Longchamp, the Bishop-elect of Ely, and some abbots. The commission travelled to Canterbury, and on 29 November 1189, managed to secure a compromise between the parties, which lasted until Hubert Walter, by then Archbishop of Canterbury, revived the plan. In the compromise, Baldwin agreed to give up the idea of a new monastic foundation around Canterbury and the monks agreed to submit to the archbishop's authority. When Richard left England in late 1189, the archbishop accompanied him to Normandy and then to Sicily, where Richard began the Third Crusade. In October 1190, Coutances was one of the negotiators between the city of Messina and the crusaders, and later was a guarantor of the peace treaty between King Richard and Tancred, the King of Sicily. The archbishop was also appointed one of the treasurers of the crusading army. While Richard was still in Sicily, word reached the king of the disputes between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard's younger brother. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England. The archbishop landed in England on 27 June, after a short detour to Rome. Coutances received a release from his crusading vow, and returned to England in the company of Richard's mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes, and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control, although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp's grip on the government somewhat insecure. In September, however, Longchamp imprisoned Richard's bastard half-brother, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king. The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20 years earlier, and Geoffrey was quickly released. Longchamp was brought to a council, headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England, which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was deposed and exiled, largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances' if the archbishop's advice was resisted by Longchamp, which it had been.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England pp. 374‚Äì377 Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity, and of trying to play both sides against the other, the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king's interest. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was excommunicated by Coutances. Acting Justiciar After Longchamp's exile Coutances was named head of a council of regency, which is sometimes equated to the post of Chief Justiciar, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document. Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar.Turner English Judiciary pp. 65‚Äì66West Justiciarship in England p. 75 He held that power until about 25 December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.Fryde, et. al Handbook of British Chronology p. 71 Coutances had long experience in the chancery, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred on raising Richard's ransom. As evidence of this emphasis on raising money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices from a wide range of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerant rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.Heiser \\"Households of the Justiciars\\" Haskings Society Journal pp. 226‚Äì228 A new note in Coutances' administration was his custom of issuing writs not in his own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent of many of the leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart pp. 130‚Äì131 The archbishop supervised the election of a new Archbishop of Canterbury, as Baldwin of Forde had died while on Crusade in 1190. Although both Longchamp and Coutances were considered as possible candidates and rivals for the see, the cathedral chapter of Canterbury elected the Bishop of Bath, Reginald fitzJocelin, in November 1191. Reginald died a month later and the see remained vacant until March 1193, when the king's candidate, Hubert Walter, was elected. During 1191 the citizens of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199.Lyon Constitutional History p. 277 In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard.West Justiciarship in England p. 77 Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.Powicke Loss of Normandy p. 95 In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at the court of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4 February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the outstanding portion of Richard's ransom, and the king was released.Gillingham Richard I pp. 247‚Äì248 and footnote 94 The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 marks for his own release. From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and spent the rest of his career on Norman affairs.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 369 His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the witnesses to the king's English charters, but not after 1194.Heiser \\"Households of the Justiciars\\" Haskings Society Journal p. 234 Return to Normandy Coutances returned to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure compensation for the losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that the conditions of the treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.Powicke Loss of Normandy pp. 113‚Äì115 When Coutances returned to his diocese in July 1196, he found that the king had seized the manor of Andely independently of the treaty provisions, and when the archbishop refused to relinquish it to the king, Richard began to fortify the manor. He also built a castle there, now Ch√¢teau Gaillard. On 7 November 1196, Coutances set off for Rome, to protest the seizure to the pope. Richard sent a royal embassy, and eventually a settlement was reached. The archbishop was ordered to remove the interdict he had placed on the duchy, and in return for the manor received two others and the seaport of Dieppe.Gillingham Richard I pp. 301‚Äì304 The various lands that Coutances' received in exchange for Andely were worth ¬£1,405 a year.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 375 This episode marked the end of Coutances' service to the Angevin kings; for the rest of his life the archbishop focused on protecting and guarding the archiepiscopal properties and rights. Service to King John When Richard died on 6 April 1199, the archbishop invested Richard's youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199. At the ceremony, John pledged to protect the Norman church, and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese. John contested the right of the archbishop to some jurisdictional rights however, as well as forest rights, forcing Coutances to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure most of the contested rights. In May 1200, Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France, but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy. In September 1201 one of Coutances' suffragan bishops, Lisiard, the Bishop of S√©es died. King John objected when the cathedral chapter attempted to elect one of their own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election, and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the Archdeacon of S√©es, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees.Richardson and Sayles Governance of Mediaeval England pp. 339‚Äì340 In May 1202 Pope Innocent III wrote to Coutances, urging him to impose religious punishments on any rebels against King John's rule in the duchy of Normandy.Turner King John p. 114 When John lost the duchy in 1204, Coutances did not resist the government of King Philip II,Turner King John p. 94 although he did not make his complete peace with Philip until March 1207.Powicke Loss of Normandy p. 264 In 1206‚Äì1207, Coutances, along with his suffragan bishops, petitioned Philip for special legal procedures relating to patronage, which Philip granted.Powicke Loss of Normandy p. 277 As archbishop Although Coutances was absent from Rouen for most of the period between 1190 and 1194, he remained an active archbishop. He secured the continued immunity of clergy from secular jurisdiction, and supervised the administration of the archdiocese. He began the custom of keeping records in registers of episcopal judgements from about 1200, and he appointed the first officials of Rouen. He also oversaw the rebuilding of Rouen Cathedral, which had begun in 1155, and restarted the work after a fire in 1200. His relations with his cathedral chapter were evidently excellent, as they remembered him as \\"a magnificent benefactor of the church of Rouen\\".Quoted in Turner \\"Coutances, Walter de\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Death and legacy Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and was buried at Rouen Cathedral, in the chapel of Saints Peter and Paul.Spear Personnel of the Norman Cathedrals p. 199 The inventory of his personal possessions made after his death included a large number of jewels and vestments. He also owned a large library, which contained not only religious works but also legal texts on canon law and works of classical authors such as Juvenal and Ovid. Coutances' nephew, John of Coutances, became Archdeacon of Oxford and Dean of Rouen under Walter's influence, and later Bishop of Worcester.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Bishops of Worcester Other nephews were William, successively a canon at Lincoln Cathedral and an archdeacon at Rouen, and Richard, also an archdeacon at Rouen. The historian John Gillingham called Coutances \\"one of the great fixers\\" of his time.Gillingham Richard I p. 111 Two other historians have argued that it was probably Coutances' judgement and stability that persuaded the king to trust him.Turner and Heiser Reign of Richard Lionheart p. 125 The medieval poet John of Hauville dedicated a satirical poem in 1184 to Coutances called Architrenius.Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 242 It was on the tribulations of a poor scholar.

Mus√©e Sainte-Croix, Poitiers. Jean Broc (1771-1850) was a French neoclassical painter. His most famous work, The Death of Hyacinthos, was completed in 1801. Hyacinthus was a young male beauty and lover of the god Apollo. One day, while playing with a discus, Hyachinthus was struck with the object and consequently died. The painting depicts Apollo's mourning for his dead lover. Some myths link a jealous Zephyr to the incident, blaming his jealousy of Hyacinthus for a gust of wind resulting in the youth's death.
