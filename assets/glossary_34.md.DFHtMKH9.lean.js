It follows a psychology student in the last week before his final exam, discovering his life and exploring his mind. Distinguished by a profound cinematic individualism, the film was made on an extremely low-budget and was entirely shot by Benetazzo without any film crew. Study has been screened and awarded at several international film festivals including the California Film Awards, Portobello Film Festival, Indie Fest,Cyprus International Film Festival. The film has since developed a cult following among fans and audience.  Plot  Starting on Monday, in the middle of his room, a student (Paolo Benetazzo) tries to study surrounded by his past and his present, obsessed by the concept of life and death, and tortured by the eternal struggle between science and religion. Each day is a distinct representation of how the student‚Äôs behavior can be influenced by interpersonal relationships and subsequently by society. His consciousness is revealed through a combination of memories, emotions and motivations in a six- day span, while one day is entirely focused on his unconscious cognitive processes. As the days go by, unexpected characters and situations interfere with the student, turning what was meant to be a regular week of study into a complete nightmare.  Production  Study is Paolo Benetazzo‚Äôs feature film directorial debut. Fascinated by the study of psychology and its impact on modern life, Benetazzo decided to explore that connection in a feature film. Once graduated in Psychology he moved to Dublin where he started writing the script. Filming began in Ireland and went on for a year. The following four years were spent in Italy, in the Venice area, shooting on small sound stages, composing the music and constantly editing. This film, he explains: ‚Äúcomes from a long introspective and experimental work developed over a period of five years. It deals with central concepts in human existence from a psychological point of view.‚Äù The film was produced on a budget of only $10,000. Benetazzo made the entire movie without any film crew. Many scenes were filmed with no one behind the camera. He later stated: ‚ÄúMaking this movie was like living a dream in hell: the budget was ridiculous, the film crew was non-existent and I had no connections whatsoever. The experience was so extreme that I thought about quitting in several occasions.‚Äù Influenced by unconventional filmmaking techniques, he worked with an open screenplay and used unknown actors, friends and family.  Soundtrack  The film features many pieces of classical music reinterpreted such as Un Sospiro and Piano Concerto No. 2 (Liszt), Funeral March (Chopin) and Nocturne in E minor, Op. posth. 72 (Chopin), Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune and Arabesque No. 1 by Debussy, L‚Äôusignuolo by Respighi, Prelude to Act 1 Lohengrin by Wagner. The film also features different music genres including hard rock, psychedelic rock, new age, funk rock, gothic rock, trash metal. The original score was composed by Jean Charles Carbone, Roberto Chemello and Paolo Benetazzo. According to Benetazzo: ‚ÄúMusic plays a crucial part in Study. The film does not rely on traditional techniques of narrative cinema. I wanted the film to be a primarily visual and sound experience in which music plays a vital role in evoking specific atmospheres.‚Äù The soundtrack album was released on iTunes on October 1, 2013.  Release  Study premiered in London at the Portobello Film Festival on September 1, 2012. It has since gained a cult status, due to underground popularity. The film was released via VHX on January 8, 2015.

There was one survivor, an infant girl. All of the victims were shot, with a total of 19 bullets fired from two handguns at close range, most in the head, and were found in relaxed poses sitting in couches and chairs, suggesting that they had been taken by surprise. There were no signs of drugs or robbery at the scene, but the home was owned by the husband of one of the victims; he was a convicted cocaine dealer. In 1985, Christopher Thomas was convicted on ten counts of manslaughter, but was cleared of murder charges. The jury had convicted him of intentional murder, but the charges were reduced due to \\"extreme emotional disturbance\\". Prosecutors said that the motive was jealousy. Thomas was sentenced to from 83 to 250 years, but due to state law was expected to spend no more than 50 years in prison. He ended up serving just over 32 years before being released in 2018, having served two thirds of the maximum fifty years allowed by New York State.

Elections for county officials are held in even-numbered years, while elections for officials in the municipalities, townships, and local boards of education are held in odd-numbered years. Counties Ohio is divided into 88 counties. Ohio law defines a structure for county government, although they may adopt charters for home rule. The minimum population requirement for incorporation is 1,600 for a village and 25,000 for a city. Summit County and Cuyahoga County have chosen an alternate form of government, while all of the other counties have a structure that includes the following elected officers: * Three county commissioners (the county board of commissioners)Ohio Revised Code ¬ß 305.01 et seq. * County sheriff:Ohio Revised Code ¬ß 311.01 The highest law enforcement officer in the county. Many cities and villages, and even some townships, have their own police forces which take over the sheriff's patrolling and response duties in their own areas, but the sheriff remains responsible for the remaining areas of the county. In some counties with large municipalities, the sheriff may have no patrolling and response duties, but the sheriff remains responsible for running the county jail, and acting as an officer of the local courts (serving warrants, transporting prisoners, acting as bailiff, etc.) * County coroner:Ohio Revised Code ¬ß 313.01 Responsible for determining the cause of death in suspicious circumstances.

The Ohio Constitution allows counties to set up a charter government as many cities and villages do, (OH county charter). Other editions available: and Google Books but only Summit County and Cuyahoga County have done so, the latter having been approved by voters in November 2009. Counties do not possess home rule powers and can do only what has been expressly authorized by the Ohio General Assembly. In the 2010 United States Census, the average population of Ohio's counties was 131,096; Cuyahoga County was the most populous (1,280,122) and Vinton County was the least (13,435). The average land area is . The largest county is Ashtabula County at and the smallest is Lake County at . The total area of the state is . Nine of the counties existed at the time of the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802.. Other editions available at and Google Books A tenth county, Wayne, was established on August 15, 1796, and encompassed most of Northwest Ohio.. Other editions available at During the Convention, the county was opposed to statehood, and was not only left out of the Convention, but dissolved; the current Wayne County is unrelated to the original. Municipalities In Ohio, there are two kinds of incorporated municipalities: cities and villages. The 2008-2009 Roster provided by the Ohio Secretary of State enumerates 251 cities and 681 villages in the state. Population is the sole distinguishing point between cities and villages; in general, municipalities with fewer than five thousand residents at the last federal census are villages and with more than five thousand are cities. Two exceptions exist: *A municipality with at least five thousand registered voters is a city *A municipality with more than five thousand residents is a village if its population falls below five thousand after subtracting out-of-town students and prisoners When the boundaries of a township are coterminous with the boundaries of a city or village, the township ceases to exist as a separate government. In order to incorporate as a city, the territory to be incorporated must meet the following conditions per section 707.29 of the Ohio Revised Code: # It shall consist of not less than four square miles. # It shall have a population of not less than twenty- five thousand and a population density of at least one thousand persons per square mile. # It shall have an assessed valuation of real, personal, and public utility property subject, except as otherwise provided in division (A)(3) of this section, to general property taxation of at least twenty-five hundred dollars per capita. In determining per capita assessed valuation under division (A)(3) of this section, the assessed valuation of any tangible personal property, buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures that are exempt from taxation under division (B) of section 5709.081 [5709.08.1] of the Revised Code shall be added to the assessed valuation of real, personal, and public utility property subject to general property taxation. # It shall not completely surround an existing municipal corporation. # It shall be contiguous. Municipalities are defined in section 703.01(A) of the Ohio Revised Code: > Municipal corporations, which, at the last federal census, had a population > of five thousand or more, or five thousand registered resident electors or > resident voters as provided in section 703.011 of the Revised Code, are > cities. All other municipal corporations are villages. Cities, which, at any > federal census, have a population of less than five thousand, shall become > villages. Villages, which, at any federal census, have a population of five > thousand or more, shall become cities. Municipalities have full home rule powers, may adopt a charter, ordinances and resolutions for self-government. Each municipality chooses its own form of government, but most have elected mayors and city councils or city commissions. City governments provide much more extensive services than county governments, such as police forces and professional (as opposed to volunteer) fire departments. Additional municipal services are often financed by local income taxes that townships cannot impose except in a Joint Economic Development District with a municipality. Not all municipalities levy income taxes; those that do range from 0.3% in the Village of Indian Hill to 3.0% in Parma Heights. Municipality names are not unique: there is a village of Centerville and a city of Centerville; also a city of Oakwood and two similarly named villages: Oakwood, Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Oakwood, Paulding County, Ohio. Townships The territory of each county is divided into townships. There are more than 1,000 townships in Ohio, ranging from the very small with only a few hundred inhabitants (e.g. Washington in Warren County) to gigantic townships with tens of thousands of residents and bigger than most cities of the state (e.g. Colerain and West Chester). The entire area of the state is encompassed by township governments, except for townships that are coterminous with a city or village. Townships may have limited home rule powers. Townships with 3,500 to 5,000 residents in an unincorporated territory may adopt a limited home rule government upon petition of voters after a referendum. Townships with 5,000 or more population in their unincorporated area may adopt limited home-rule government powers, either after voter approval or by resolution of the board of township trustees under certain conditions. Such townships with 15,000 or more population are called \\"urban townships\\". When the boundaries of a township are coterminous with the boundaries of a city or village, the township ceases to exist as a separate government (called a paper township). As a result, there are many townships that do not exist as functioning legal jurisdictions (e.g. City of Cincinnati is in Millcreek Township but does not exist separately). Townships have four elected officials: A three-member board of township trustees and a fiscal officer. All are elected to four-year terms in non-partisan elections. School districts There are more than 600 city, local, and exempted village school districts providing K-12 education in Ohio. There are also about four dozen joint vocation school districts which are separate from the K-12 districts. The borders of the school district do not strictly follow county, township, or municipal borders. A school district can exist in multiple townships, municipalities, or counties. Each city school district, local school district, or exempted village school district is governed by an elected board of education. The board has direct authority over the local schools and appoints the local superintendent of schools. A school district previously under state supervision (municipal school district) may be governed by a board whose members either are elected or appointed by the mayor of the municipality containing the greatest portion of the district's area. School districts may levy local school taxes and issue bonds with voter approval. Although most tax-financed schools are funded through property taxes, districts may also impose income taxes, which are up to 1.75% of earned income. In 1914, the Ohio General Assembly created county boards of education to provide support services to local school districts. Subsequently, in 1995 the county boards of education were renamed Educational Service Centers and allowed to merge with neighboring ESCs to form regional agencies. Each ESC is supervised by a locally elected governing board and headed by a superintendent. On average 23.51% of an ESC's funding is provided by the state, 8.75% federal, 3.13% other, and 64.61% is generated through fee-for-service contracts with customer school districts.

SAM describes itself as a bi-partisan partnership that works with local, state, and federal legislators to create policies that decrease marijuana use. SAM advocates for civil penalties for marijuana use (what some call decriminalization), along with mandated treatment, prevention, education, and awareness. The media has called SAM the \\"well-organized opposition\\" to marijuana legalization. History and background SAM was founded in 2013, by former Congressman Patrick Kennedy (D-Rhode Island), former White House drug policy adviser Kevin Sabet, senior editor of The Atlantic David Frum and a group of health professionals in response to the successful 2012 marijuana legalization initiatives in Colorado and Washington. Its mission is to educate citizens on the science of marijuana use and marijuana commercialization, the importance of science-based drug policy, and research into the potential medical use of compounds derived from marijuana. The group seeks to support the following four priorities: * Prevent Big Marijuana. SAM endeavors to prevent the formation of Big Marijuana, a potential commercial marijuana industry. SAM also seeks to prevent Big Tobacco from expanding its influence into Big Marijuana. * Educate. SAM works to inform the public and policymakers about what the group considers to be \\"the science of today's marijuana.\\" * Reduce consequences. SAM aspires to open a dialogue about reducing civil and criminal penalties for marijuana offenders. * Medical research. SAM aims to encourage medical marijuana research and promote the development of FDA-approved marijuana medications. In 2013, the organization was endorsed by former president Jimmy Carter, who stated \\"I'm very proud of Patrick Kennedy and his Project SAM, Smart Approaches to Marijuana\\". \\"I wish him and Kevin Sabet every success in your independent project to make sure marijuana is handled responsibly.\\" Issues =Criminal penalties for use= SAM supports removing criminal penalties for use, advocating instead for treatment. =Medicinal marijuana products= Project SAM supports study of components of marijuana. The organization supports FDA-approved, pharmacy-based cannabis medications. Funding SAM says it is mostly funded by small donors, and by grants.

He ruled until 1222.  Life  Henry was the younger of two sons of the Count of Saarbr√ºcken, Simon I, to whose estate Zweibr√ºcken Castle belonged. Whilst the older son was given Saarbr√ºcken, the younger son received the eastern part of the region with Zweibr√ºcken and the Lorraine fiefdoms of Lindres, Saargem√ºnd and Marimont. In addition there were estates near Worms that belonged to the County of Zweibr√ºcken. Henry is first recorded in 1196 in a treaty made with Emperor Henry VI. In this deed, he transferred his rights over the inherited Vogtei of Dirmstein to the empire. In 1198, he concluded a deed of exchange with Abbot Wernher of Hornbach Abbey, in which he acquired the hills of \\"Gutinberg\\" and the \\"Ruprechtisberg\\". Lemberg Castle was built on the former and Ruppertstein Castle on the latter. In the decades that followed, Henry is found variously as a signatory or witness to deeds, for example in 1211 in the confirmation of town rights on the Strasbourg by Emperor Otto. In 1224 he accompanied King Henry to Toul for negotiations with the French king, Louis VIII. In his coat of arms Count Henry adopted a lion in recognition of his Saarbr√ºcken origins; however, it was red with a blue tongue on a gold field, as is the case today in the town coat of arms of Zweibr√ºcken.  Family  Henry married Hedwig of Lorraine, the daughter of Duke Frederick I of Lorraine. She had two children.

The film stars Cameron Monaghan, Liv Tyler, Judy Greer, Morgan Saylor, Noah Silver, and Madisen Beaty. The film premiered in-competition in the US Dramatic Category at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014. Plot The body of a teenager named Jamie Marks, the social outcast of his small town, is found by the river. His ghost is then seen by two high school students: Gracie Highsmith, who discovered the body, and Adam McCormick. As time progresses they begin to understand why he is coming to them specifically. In life, Jamie was in love with Adam, but thought the love unrequited. Over time, Adam admits that he had noticed Jamie in life but had never pursued friendship on any level. In death, Jamie finds the courage to court Adam. Adam and Jamie begin a loving but platonic relationship, which is complicated by their outside relationships in the spirit and material worlds. Cast *Cameron Monaghan as Adam McCormick *Noah Silver as Jamie Marks *Liv Tyler as Linda *Judy Greer as Lucy *Morgan Saylor as Gracie Highsmith *Madisen Beaty as Frances Wilkinson *Ronen Rubinstein as Ronnie Reception Jamie Marks Is Dead received mostly positive reviews upon its premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Dennis Harvey, in his review for Variety, gave the film a positive review by saying that \\"The potentially ludicrous story is handled artfully enough here to cast an eerie but not off-putting spell throughout, though the ultimate point is more than a tad murky, and the desired poignancy doesn't fully come across.\\" John DeFore in his review for The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"A sincere, psychologically savvy take on YA supernatural fare.\\" Kyle Burton of Indiewire praised the film and said that \\"Carter Smith's Jamie Marks is Dead is a spooky rendition of teenage passion and shame. It has requisite angst and melodrama, but they‚Äôre guided by the film's immersive atmosphere and sense of place. It's a gothic romance‚Äîa sort of coming out, bullying story that projects onto its world the moods and emotions of its characters.\\" Jordan Raup of The Film Stage praised Carter Smith's direction that \\"Smith‚Äôs expertise in crafting visceral, frightening scenarios‚Äîexemplified in his somewhat under-appreciated studio horror feature The Ruins‚Äîis fully on display here.

Originally South from Granada, 1957 (\\"Fat seller/maker\\") is the Spanish name for a kind of bogeymanSacamantecas in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola or criminal characterized by killing for human fat. Anthropology Julian Pitt- Rivers reportsThe People of the Sierra, J. A. Pitt-Rivers, page 205, 1954, Criterion Books, New York. in his study of Alcal√° de la Sierra the belief that village children can be stolen by an outsider, called el sacamantecas, disguised as a beggar or a trader, who is hired by a rich man whose ill child can only be cured with the blood of healthy babies. The practice of blood donation lent credence to the myth. Gerald Brenan describes the mantequero as a monster in human form who lives in deserted areas and feeds on mantecamanteca in the DRAE (\\"human fat\\"). Upon capture, he shouts in a high- pitched voice and, unless just fed, looks thin. Brenan found the myth alive during his stays in the Alpujarra (Andalusia): In 1927 or 1928, he had sublet his Yegen home to the British writer Dick Strachey, nephew of Lytton Strachey. One day, Strachey was walking on rough terrain where he saw three suspicious men. Fearing of bandoleros, he ran away, but the three Gipsies chased him and drew their knives shouting at him as a mantequero. The first impulse of the Gipsies was to kill the mantequero and use his blood for magical remedies. However the eldest Gipsy, a convict, judged safer to bring Strachey to the mayor. They offered to slit his throat themselves, but the British man claimed in his rudimentary Spanish to be a relative of king George V of England, convincing the mayor that he was not dealing with a monster. A friend of Brenan found that in Torremolinos all the girls believed in mantequeros. In the urban version of the legend, an old evil marquis needs baby blood transfusions to rejuvenate. Real sacamantecas *Manuel Blanco Romasanta (1809-1863) was the first serial killer documented in Spain. He operated in Galicia. With the fat of his victims he made soap for sale. During his trial, he alleged to be cursed with lycanthropy. *Juan D√≠az de Garayo (1821-1881) was a Spanish serial killer operating in Northern Spain. He was nicknamed el Sacamantecas, which became used to scare children into behaving. * In 1910 Francisco Leona and Julio Tonto Hern√°ndez kidnapped and killed a boy of seven years for his blood and fat to treat the tuberculosis of Francisco Ortega, a wealthy farmer who hired the men for that purpose in what is known as the Crime of G√°dor.

The notion \\"Clifford module bundle\\" should not be confused with a Clifford bundle, which is a bundle of Clifford algebras. Spinor bundles Given an oriented Riemannian manifold M one can ask whether it is possible to construct a bundle of irreducible Clifford modules over C‚Ñì(T*M). In fact, such a bundle can be constructed if and only if M is a spin manifold. Let M be an n-dimensional spin manifold with spin structure FSpin(M) ‚Üí FSO(M) on M. Given any C‚ÑìnR-module V one can construct the associated spinor bundle :S(M) = F_{\\\\mathrm{Spin}}(M) \\\\times_\\\\sigma V\\\\, where œÉ : Spin(n) ‚Üí GL(V) is the representation of Spin(n) given by left multiplication on S. Such a spinor bundle is said to be real, complex, graded or ungraded according to whether on not V has the corresponding property. Sections of S(M) are called spinors on M. Given a spinor bundle S(M) there is a natural bundle map :C\\\\ell(T^*M) \\\\otimes S(M) \\\\to S(M) which is given by left multiplication on each fiber.

He was known for his work among the African-American community of Baltimore and for his high church Anglicanism. His feast day, September 23, is included in the Lesser Feasts and Fasts of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland.  Early life  Joseph Richey was born in the town of Newry, County Down, in Ireland,William F.

Mary the Virgin, Baltimore. (New York: James Pott & Co., 1884) although other sources give Belfast as his place of birth.'The Churchman, November 17, 1877 page 558 He emigrated with members of his family to the United States when he was ten years old, originally staying in Butler, Pennsylvania. Richey eventually decided to become an Anglican priest, and so at age 16 he headed to Baltimore, where his older brother Thomas Richey, who would eventually go on to become the second president of Bard College, was then serving as rector of Mount Calvary Church. Joseph obtained his bachelor of arts degree from Trinity College (Connecticut), where at commencement exercises he addressed his fellow students, the graduating class of 1866, on the topic of \\"The Vicissitudes of a Nation's Literature\\".New York Times, July 1, 1866, page 1 From there, Richey attended the General Theological Seminary in New York.  Ministry  Richey was ordained as a deacon on May 23, 1869, at the Church of the Transfiguration in New York by Bishop Horatio PotterJournal of the Proceedings of the Eighty-Sixth Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of New York (New York: Potts and Amery, 1869) page 8 and on September 17 of that year was received into the Episcopal Diocese of Albany.Journal of the Proceedings of the Primary Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Albany (Albany: Charles Benthuysen and Sons, 1868) page 96 Richey was ordained priest on December 18, 1869 by William Croswell Doane, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Albany,Journal of the proceedings of the third of the protestant episcopal diocese of Albany (Albany: Charles Benthuysen and Sons, 1870), page 126 and a day later was installed as rector of the congregation that is now St. John's Church Complex (Delhi, New York) in that diocese. Bishop Doane later described Richey as ‚Äúthe best theologian he knew‚Äù.Boston Daily Advertiser, September 28, 1877. Soon after, Richey became one of the clergy of the Church of the Advent in Boston, of which the rector, Charles Chapman Grafton, was a co-founder of the Society of St. John the Evangelist, a high- church Anglican religious order also known as the Cowley Fathers. In 1872, Alfred Allen Paul Curtis resigned his position as rector of Mount Calvary Church in Baltimore so that he might enter the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop William Rollinson Whittingham, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland and whose family parish Mount Calvary was, asked Richey to become rector.Jervis S. Zimmerman An Embattled Priest: The Life of Fr. Oliver Sherman Prescott 1824-1903 (Bloomington: AuthorHouse, 2012) page 55 Richey accepted, and thus became the seventh rector of Mount Calvary, on the condition that he should be accompanied by his friend from seminary days, the \\"zealous ritualist\\"George Edmed Demille, The Catholic Movement in the American Episcopal Church (Philadelphia: Church Historical Society, 1941) page 73 Rev. Calbraith Bourn Perry. That same year, Richey invited the All Saints Sisters of the Poor to send members from England to help in the work of his church. Mother Harriet Brownlow Byron, their superior, dispatched Sisters Helen, Serena, and Winifred to BaltimoreSusan Mumm (ed.)

Mary the Virgin, Baltimore.  Death  Richey was in poor health and on the advice of his physician, Samuel C. Chew, set out for Europe, hoping the \\"change in air\\" would provide a cure. The ship sailed from New York on July 26, 1877. He reached London on the evening of September 17, 1877. Three days later, he met with his friend, Father Richard Meux Benson, another co-founder of the Society of St. John the Evangelist. The Rev. Arthur Brinckman, chaplain to the All Saints Sisters, was with him until two in the morning; but Richey died at 5:00 on the morning of September 21, the cause of death being pulmonary disease. His body was returned to Baltimore and a burial service was held at Mount Calvary Church on October 18, 1887. The Baltimore Sun reported that a great crowd attended the service and lined the streets; Richey was buried at St. John's Episcopal Cemetery, close to the grave of Mother Harriet.Baltimore Sun October 19, 1887.  Controversies  In a memorial service of October 21, Rev. William F. Brand asserted of Richey that \\"A mere man of books he was not; but having entered on the duties of clerical life with a better preparation through the use of books than do the greater number of our clergy, he took care to keep his mind in due exercise as a scholar... In conveying to others the result of study, or in persuasion, he was not a brilliant orator; but in speech he was easy and self-possessed, and he gave an impression not only of the sincerity of his convictions, but also of the exactness of his knowledge.\\" Richey believed in the doctrine of the Real Presence and heard confessions, both of which were controversial in the Episcopal church at that time. Richey and Perry were sent before Bishop William Rollinson Whittingham on February 4 and 5, 1875, for \\"violation of their ordination vows and of the articles of religion\\" for offering prayers for the dead.Appleton's Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1875 (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1876) page 628 Bishop Whittingham objected to Richey's use of altar lights, wafer bread, elevating the Host, making the sign of the cross, and praying for the dead.New York Times, August 3, 1875 page 1. Bishop Whittingham was subsequently charged by two clergymen and five laymen of the diocese with neglect of duty for failing to admonish Perry and Richey. A board of inquiry found that there was insufficient grounds to proceed further, but made a \\"unanimous and emphatic condemnation of the alleged teachings of Rev. Messrs. Calbraith Perry and Joseph Richey.Appletons' Annual Cyclop√¶dia and Register of Important Events of the Year, D. Appleton & Company, 1877, p. 651 Prayers for the dead had been removed from the 1552 edition of the Book of Common Prayer as connected to the \\"Romish invention\\" of purgatory, until in the aftermath of World War I it was revived in some areas as an element of pastoral care.Gould, James B., Understanding Prayer for the Dead, Lutterworth Press, 2017, pp. 37-38  Acclaim  In spite of theological controversies, Richey's great devotion to the priesthood and to ministry was acclaimed by many. William Francis Brand said \\"Your clergy will tell you that, while prompt to spare them, he never spared himself. I myself have seen him later than two o'clock taking his first morsel of food after constant labour from six in the morning,‚Äîa labour so wearying to the body through the spirit; and this at a time when the disease which cut short his days gave him little rest in sleep. And yet his complaint was that he neglected duties.\\" Elsewhere he wrote of Richey as a man of \\"a lovely spirit, holy, self-sacrificing, full of labors.\\"William Francis Brand Life of William Rollinson Whittingham, Fourth Bishop of Maryland, Volume 2 (New York: E. & J.B. Young and Co., 1883) page 212 His former assistant rector at Mount Calvary, Calbourn Perry, wrote \\"He drew to himself devoted friends and ardent admirers. His enthusiasm, his brilliant intellect, the positiveness of his convictions, were singularly blended with a woman's tenderness and sympathy. Men who widely differed from him respected him, and those who had keenly felt his reproofs, loved him.\\" A letter published in England's newspaper The Guardian describes him as \\"a brave American priest... he has left behind him as his monument in the history of the American church his devoted labors in Baltimore, his saintly life, his wonderful success in building up the spiritual fabric of the Church of Mount Calvary, and the many valuable agencies he has inaugurated... how many tears and prayers will go up before God for His brave soldier and servant, the young and crowned priest.\\"The Guardian, letter of Robert Linelater, October 10, 1877, quoted in The Churchman, November 17, 1877 page 558 Hall Harrison, in his biography of Bishop John Barrett Kerfoot, said that Richey \\"so well known and so justly beloved in Maryland as rector of Mount Calvary Church, Baltimore, was himself of a frank, ingenuous nature, full of burning zeal, firm in his convictions, and fearless and outspoken in maintaining them.\\"Hall Harrison ed. Life of the Right Reverend John Barrett Kerfoot, First Bishop of Pittsburgh: With Selections from his Diaries and Correspondence (New York: James Pott and Co., 1866, volume II, 1864-1881) p. 489 In 1987, the All Saints Sisters and the Mount Calvary Church jointly founded a hospice, which was named the Joseph Richey House in his honor.

Literally the word means \\"glue cell\\", and it has a number of poorly distinguished synonyms, such as colloblast.Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 1, Protozoa, Porifera, Coelenterata, Ctenophora, Echinodermata. Macmillan Company 1906 Use in Botany In English the term \\"collocyte\\" (or, less formally, \\"glue cell\\") is uncommon in botanical publications. It appears more often in French texts; however, it sometimes is used in referring to individual cells in ground tissues of types characterised as collenchyma. Use in Zoology In zoology the word \\"collocyte\\" applies to several different types of cell in very different taxa, and there are a few similar terms used confusingly or interchangeably, such as colloblast. Some of the terms refer to specialised subject matter, so from time to time variations and inconsistent definitions have been coined independently in niche disciplines. For example, glial cells sometimes are called \\"glue cells\\" but have little in common with other types of so-called glue cells. Apart from such difficulties, \\"glue cells\\" of various types commonly occur in taxa of animals that are practically unrelated to each other, and in such cases they are as a rule non-homologous and differ profoundly in their morphology, histology and function. This suggests that distinct terms should be allocated to the different types. The problem is so marked that to avoid confusion many workers are abandoning traditional terms in favour of new words. =Collocytes in Tunicata= Among the taxa of animals that have some form of cells that might be classed as collocytes, are the larvae of sessile forms of Tunicates. Near the head end, most of those have collocytes with which they permanently fasten themselves to the substrate. =Collocytes in Ctenophora= Perhaps the most striking and celebrated examples of collocytes are those of the Ctenophora (comb jellies). The Ctenophora use their colloblasts or collocytes in hunting and gathering food, in much the same way as members of the Cnidaria use cnidocytes; they keep the cells in a retracted form until they deploy them for securing prey. In keeping with their food capturing function, the collocytes sometimes are called \\"lasso cells\\", but as is to be expected of common names, the term is not precise and is variously applied to both colloblasts and cnidocytes. The retracted mechanism is kept coiled in the Ctenophora, as opposed to inside out in the Cnidaria. The Cnidaria evert their stings to penetrate the prey, but the Ctenophora eject microscopic balls of adhesive mucus that stick to the prey externally, trailing threads that as a rule do not lose attachment to the parent colloblast. The structure of these specialized cells is extremely complex and varies among ctenophore species. Their mechanisms are still under study. =Collenocytes= In some organisms collocytes that attach the animal to substrates must be able to release their grip as well as establish it. Commonly, though not always, this requires the ability to dissolve the adhesive substances after the adhesion has been achieved. When a glandular structure has the ability to perform both the adhesion and the dissolving of the adhesive, it is called a duo-gland This is a very common requirement and examples occur in Platyhelminths, both parasiticWhittington ID, Cribb BW.

In some organisms the adhesion it affords is so remarkably reversible that it is used as the basis of locomotion over solid surfaces. =Confusion between collocytes and collencytes= Another class of apparently similarly-named cells, \\"collencytes\\" occurs in sponges, but in this case there is little to do with adhesion. The term was derived from the tissue in which the cells occur: collenchyma.CHENG, THOMAS C.; YEE, HERBERT W. F.; RIFKIN, ERIK. Studies on the Internal Defense Mechanisms of Sponges. PACIFIC SCIENCE, Vol. XXII, July 1968 The name collenchyma in turn was borrowed from botany because of a fancied, essentially irrelevant, resemblance between sponge tissue and a particular class of ground tissue in plants. The collencytes are one of the classes of component cells of the sponges' tissue, loose mesenchyme between the ectoderm and the endoderm in the body wall.Lankester, E. Ray. A treatise on zoology. Volume 2. London, A. and C. Black 1900 The functions of the collencytes are not yet fully understood; they are branched amoeboid cells and appear to produce collagen and play roles in forming sponge spicules. It even has been proposed that they have primitive nerve-like physiologic roles.LI Hui, ZHANG Xiao-Yun, WANG An-Tai. Exploration on primordial nervous substances in sponges.

Applications of the technology are used to keep marine mammals away from aquaculture facilities and to keep birds away from certain areas (for instance in the vicinity of airports and blueberry fields).

Only acoustic harassment devices that cause actual pain have been found to be effective over the longer term.Conflicts Between Protected Species and Fisheries: Social Science Research and Policy Approaches Riku Varjopuro, Nordic Council of Ministers, 2003 - Ecosystem management The devices can cause hearing damage in non- targeted species and design changes in the fishing gear, fishing methods, and fish farm design to provide a permanent solution are preferable. History An acoustic pinger (active sonar) used to repel cetaceans (including dolphins and porpoises) away from fishing nets Primitive harassment methods included firecrackers, rubber bullets, chasing animals by boat, banging pipes and seal bombs (incendiary devices). Devices emitting loud noises have also been used, including broadcasts of killer whale sounds, pingers, and acoustic buzzers. These often employ shrill sounding screams broadcast between 12 and 17 kHz. Acoustic deterrent devices normally broadcast near 10 kHz and use high volume. The intensity level of acoustic harassment devices has been measured up to 194 dB re 1uPa @ 1 m and the noise can be audible up to 50 kilometers away. Assessments Studies of long-term effects on the marine environment have not been carried out, including damage to non-targeted species. Results of the devices are mixed, and they have proved ineffective in some circumstances, especially over the long term, while design improvements such as electric fences to keep seals from climbing into enclosures, gear modification to exclude certain species, and keeping aquaculture plants clean of dead fish have often been effective at solving the problem of keeping predatory species away.Marine Mammals: Fisheries, Tourism and Management Issues by Nick Gales, Mark Hindell, Roger Kirkwood Reports indicate that in contrast to the harassment devices, the deterrent devices have been very effective in dealing with cetacean bycatch.

East Weare Rifle Range is a disused naval rifle range on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is located within the area of East Weares, overlooking Portland Harbour. The range became a scheduled monument in October 2015, which included the stop butt of Portland stone, the marker's gallery and 100-yard firing position. It remains on the private property of Portland Port Ltd, and has not been opened to the public, however can be seen from surrounding coastal paths. The range was not the only one of its kind on the island. A rifle and revolver range was once located near King's Pier, while a late 20th-century light automatic range was also located nearby. History Stop butt structure, including a disused telegraph pole and part of sentry lookout post. The East Weare Rifle Range was built at the beginning of the 20th century on land the war department purchased.https://www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/media/199172/Portland-conservation- area- appraisal/pdf/Appraisal_of_the_Conservation_Areas_of_Portland_as_amended_2017.pdf It was built as part of the general development of the naval base and its training provisions, where it was used to train naval and other military service personnel. Due to its close proximity to the railway line of the Portland Branch Railway, red flags would be hoisted whenever the range was in use. The range ceased operating during the 1980s after the government reviewed all active firing ranges in the UK and classed Portland's range as dangerous due to the public footpaths surrounding it. Today, the range remains a reminder of the military presence at Portland. The surrounding area is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). In 2007, ten British Primitive goats were released into the area to control the scrub. Design The large stop butt is located at the south-east end of the range, and measures approximately 100 metres in length and 30 metres wide. The marker's gallery, situated on the opposite side, survives in reasonable condition. It held the Hythe pattern target frame which was used to raise and lower the targets.http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=1423228&resourceID;=7 The range had firing points, earth and stone-built mounds, at 100 yard intervals from 100 yards to 600 yards, with an additional lane of fire to the north-east, firing from 800 yards. Today, only the 100 and 200 yard positions survive. Within proximity of the rifle range are two remaining sentry posts, where lookouts would warn away walkers when shooting was taking place. An observation post also remains above the range on the clifftop. There are also two World War II pillboxes within the range's perimeter.

Life He was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the only child of Arnold Nurse and Gertrude (n√©e Small), and spent some of his childhood in Venezuela before returning to the island to complete his education. He absorbed local calypso music traditions, and started work as a teacher in Tobago. He taught himself piano, and learned arranging skills from a mail order Glenn Miller book, before returning around 1936 to Trinidad where he worked in an electronics business. He also learned to play the tenor saxophone and, with Guyanese saxophonist Wally Stewart, formed the Moderneers (or Modernaires), the first American-style big band in Trinidad. During the Second World War he played with visiting Americans on the island, and began writing jazz arrangements of calypsos.Val Wilmer, \\"Rupert Nurse: The first musician to write big band arrangements of calypso\\", The Guardian, 18 April 2001. Retrieved 15 April 2014.\\"Oral history of jazz in Britain: Rupert Nurse\\", British Library. Retrieved 15 April 2014.Biography at Allmusic.com. Retrieved 15 April 2014. He travelled to London in 1945, and began playing double bass with guitarist Fitzroy Coleman and pianist Cyril Jones in the Antilles jazz club near Leicester Square. He joined trumpeter Leslie \\"Jiver\\" Hutchinson's mostly-black band, with whom he played on radio and toured in Europe, before working with entertainer Cab Kaye in the Netherlands. He also increasingly worked with musicians newly arriving in Britain from the West Indies, including popular pianist Winifred Atwell, and Lord Kitchener (Aldwyn Roberts) and his band; and, along with Lauderic Caton, began experimenting with electronic instruments. In 1953, Nurse was appointed as musical director of the Melodisc record label established by Emil Shalit, which increasingly sought to release records to appeal to Britain's growing Afro-Caribbean community. He led the label's house band, arranged and produced Kitchener's recordings, and recorded many other musicians of Caribbean origin, including jazz saxophonist Joe Harriott. He also continued to perform as a pianist, and became bandleader at the Sunset Club in Carnaby Street and then at the more up-market Sugar Hill club in St James's, where he met and later recorded with American jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams. He increasingly used an electric piano and organ, and worked widely in clubs and restaurants in London as a solo performer and with other musicians including steel pan player Hugo Gunning, bassist Coleridge Goode, and pianists Iggy Quail and Russ Henderson. He also taught, devised arrangements for other musicians, and worked as a library cataloguer in London until 1976. He retired to Arima, Trinidad, but continued to mentor musicians there and write arrangements for them. He died there in 2001, at the age of 90.

Life and career John W. Walker was born in Hope, Arkansas where he attended Yerger High School until 1952. In 1965, Walker began the general practice of law in Little Rock, Arkansas with the emphasis on civil rights. In 1968, he opened one of the first three racially integrated law firms in the south, first known as Walker and Chachkin. Between 1965 and his death in 2019, Walker was personally involved in most of the reported cases which involve racial discrimination in the state of Arkansas. Many of them are landmark having created new law and opened doors to school houses and work places throughout the state of Arkansas and surrounding states. One case took his time since 1965, the Little Rock school case started by the late Wiley Branton and LDF general counsel/later Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Many of Walker's early cases involved classes of people discriminated against by mega corporate environments due to their race. A recent case of Walker's was the only nationwide racial discrimination case ever successfully prosecuted against Wal-Mart. It involved a class of African American truck drivers. He died at his home in Little Rock on October 28, 2019 at the age of 82. Education Walker graduated from Jack Yates High School in Houston, Texas, in 1954. He was the first African American undergraduate student admitted to the University of Texas after the Brown decision in 1954 but was not allowed to attend for racial reasons. In 1958, he graduated from Arkansas AM&N; College in Pine Bluff, Arkansas with a degree in Sociology; in 1961 he received a master's degree from New York University; and in 1964 he received a law degree from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

It is known for its manufacture of knitted clothing and blankets designed by Solveig Hisdal. History Oleana was founded in 1992 by Signe Aarhus, Hildegunn M√∏ster, and Kolbj√∏rn Valestrand. Textile production was moving out of Norway and the unemployment rate was high. They had been working for Dale of Norway and felt that a smaller company with a flat rather than hierarchical structure could be efficient enough to succeed while manufacturing in Norway. They named the company after the musician Ole Bull's utopian settlement of Oleana in New Norway, Pennsylvania. In the age of Norwegian nationalism Ole Bull had collected Norwegian folk music and brought it into the best concert halls. In the same spirit they wished to preserve and develop the Norwegian knitting tradition. They hired designer Solveig Hisdahl after seeing her exhibit in Oslo, \\"Wedding Jackets from a Town Girl\\", inspired by Norwegian folk costumes. Aarhus, M√∏ster, and Valestrand started out by raising funds for good used knitting machines. They opened a factory near Bergen in space rented from another knitwear manufacturer. The Bergen area has a tradition of textile mills and continues to have commercial wool spinners. In 1996 Oleana received a grant from the Norwegian Industrial Development Fund for newly established industries. In 2003 Aarhus was named Norway\`s \\"Business Woman of the Year\\". In 2012 the factory moved into the old Arne Fabrikker mill in Arna. That company built the first textile mill in western Norway in 1856, and operated there until 1978. Clothing and blankets are produced on up-to- date industrial knitting and linking machines and finished by hand. The textiles are exported to other countries in Europe and to North America, Australia, and New Zealand. They are sold in upscale shops around the world. In 2018, with designer Hisdahl considering retirement, the company hired Mathilda Nordberg to work with her. Nordberg is a graduate of London's Royal College of Art. Awards and exhibitions In 1993 Oleana was awarded the Norwegian Design Council's \\"Award for Design Excellence\\" in textile and clothing design. The company received the award again in 1997, 1999, 2001 (twice) and 2002. In 2000 Hisdahl was awarded the Jacob Prize by Norsk Form, the Foundation for Design and Architecture in Norway, for her work in clothing design. In the fall of 2001 the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, Washington, presented an exhibit on the work of Solveig Hisdal and Oleana. The Goldstein Museum of Design in St. Paul, Minnesota, exhibited Hisdal's work in the winter of 2004.

The San Diego Padres selected Ross in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft (25th overall). In 2015 Ross made his major league debut. Career =Minor leagues= =San Diego Padres= The San Diego Padres selected Ross in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft (25th overall) out of Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, California. He had committed to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, but signed with the Padres. He made his professional debut for the Arizona League Padres. Prior to the 2012 season he was ranked by Baseball Prospectus as the 95th best prospect in baseball. In 2012, he pitched for the Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Class-A Midwest League but ended up missing most of the season on the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation after being unable to make a May 10 start against the South Bend Silver Hawks due to tightness. Ross returned for the 2013 season in Fort Wayne. Ross during his tenure with the Lake Elsinore Storm, advanced-A affiliates of the San Diego Padres, in He started the 2014 season with the Lake Elsinore Storm of the Class-A Advanced California League. He was promoted to Double-A during the season. =Washington Nationals= On December 19, 2014, the Padres traded Ross and a player to be named later, Trea Turner, to the Washington Nationals as part of a three-team trade, in which the Padres traded Jake Bauers, Burch Smith, and Ren√© Rivera to the Tampa Bay Rays, and Washington traded Steven Souza and Travis Ott to Tampa Bay. On June 6, 2015, Ross was called up to the majors for the first time and he made his major league debut that day as a starting pitcher.Nationals bring up prospect Joe Ross, send down A.J. Cole Ross outdueled Jimmy Nelson and A. J. Burnett in his second and third starts, respectively, earning wins for the Washington Nationals. He struck out 11 batters in his third appearance, snapping an eight-game winning streak by the Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 6, manager Matt Williams announced Ross would remain in the rotation and veteran starter Doug Fister would move to the bullpen, in recognition of the rookie's strong performance since his promotion. Ross' promotion lasted barely a month before Williams said on September 8 that reliever Tanner Roark would take over his spot in the rotation and Ross would move to the bullpen in an effort to keep him from exceeding an undisclosed \\"innings limit\\" for the season. Although Ross started the 2016 season in the Nationals' rotation, he lost much of the season due to right shoulder inflammation. He was placed on the disabled list on July 3, 2016, and was activated again on September 18. Upon returning from the disabled list, Ross struggled to pitch deep into games, more than once forming a tandem with rookie right-hander Reynaldo L√≥pez to pitch the first few innings of a game before L√≥pez took over in long relief. Ross started game 4 of the 2016 NLDS with the Nats up 2-1 in the series giving up 4 runs on 55 pitches in 2.2 innings. Ross was an up-and-down contributor for the Nationals in the first half of the 2017 season. He started the year pitching for the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, but after Nationals starter Jeremy Guthrie was shelled for 10 earned runs in less than an inning in what would be his only appearance of the season, Ross was called up. Upon struggling in the early going, he was optioned back to Syracuse on May 1 in favor of Jacob Turner. Ross returned to the major league rotation on May 23, pitching well against the Seattle Mariners. Through the first half of the season, Ross received more run support than any other pitcher in the major leagues, with the Nationals averaging more than 10 runs in games Ross started. Out of 13 starts by Ross at the major league level in 2017, the Nationals scored at least 10 runs in eight of them. However, in the last of these starts, against the Atlanta Braves on July 9, Ross exited in the fourth inning as the velocity of his fastball dipped so low into the mid-80s that the stadium radar gun was registering them as changeups. On July 15, 2017, medical tests confirmed that his elbow was diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament. It was further announced that he would undergo ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (\\"Tommy John\\") surgery, ruling him out for the remainder of the season and at least part of the 2018 season. In 2017 he was 5-3 with a 5.01 ERA. After recovering from his surgery, Ross attempted to make his first MLB start in 14 months on September 7, 2018, facing the Chicago Cubs on a rainy evening at Nationals Park. The game began after a 1-hour 21-minute delay, but the teams played for only 23 minutes before the game was stopped again with two outs in the top of the second inning and the score tied 0‚Äì0.Zuckerman, Mark, \\"Game postponed after two delays, true doubleheader Saturday,\\" masnsports.com, September 7, 2018, 11:55 PM EDT Retrieved September 8, 2018Zuckerman, Mark, \\"Game postponed after two delays, true doubleheader Saturday,\\" masnsports.com, September 8, 2018, 2:59 PM EDT Retrieved September 8, 2018 Another 2-hour 54-minute delay ensued before the game was postponed. In his -inning outing, Ross threw 24 pitches, gave up one single and hit one batter, but retired the other five Cubs he faced, and his fastball was clocked consistently at 95 to 96 mph, occasionally reaching 97 mph, which was better than his pre-surgery velocity. In 2018 in three games he was 0-2 with a 5.06 ERA. In 2019 he was 4-4 with a 5.48 ERA. Ross started game 5 of the 2019 World Series for the Nationals in place of Max Scherzer, who was dealing with a back injury. He allowed 4 runs in 5 innings and was credited with the loss as the Astros won 7-1. Ross received a World Series ring for his efforts after the Nationals defeated the Astros in 7 games. On June 29, 2020, Ross announced he would not play in the shortened 2020 season during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal life Ross has an older brother, Tyson Ross, who pitches in MLB.

It is the 108th episode overall. After learning that Stephen Hawking is coming to lecture at Caltech, Howard (Simon Helberg) is hired to maintain his wheelchair equipment. When Sheldon (Jim Parsons) discovers this, he is desperate to meet Hawking. Howard says he can, but only if he completes a humiliating series of tasks. The final scene of the episode features a short cameo appearance by cosmologist Stephen Hawking. Hawking was revealed to appear on the show in March 2012; he was the third high-profile guest star in season 5. The episode had 13.29 million viewers in America and garnered mixed reviews. Plot Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Leonard (Johnny Galecki) are at lunch with Howard when he gets an e-mail from Stephen Hawking's office; Hawking is coming to lecture at Caltech and needs an engineer to help maintain his wheelchair equipment. Sheldon is a big fan of Hawking, so Howard considers bringing Sheldon along to meet Hawking. Sheldon then arrives and says that he has revolutionized understanding of the Higgs boson particle; he explains it to Raj and Leonard but ignores Howard, thinking he wouldn't understand. Howard, feeling insulted, refuses to introduce Sheldon to Hawking even after Sheldon pleads. The next day, Howard talks about his work with Hawking to frustrate Sheldon. After Sheldon begs, Howard agrees to give Sheldon's paper on the Higgs boson to Hawking on the condition that Sheldon performs several tasks for him. The first task is to polish Howard's belt buckles. Howard tends to stand too close to the urinal and urine often splashes back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him. Leonard, Raj, and Howard are all laughing and enjoying Sheldon's embarrassment. When Penny (Kaley Cuoco) goes to do her laundry, she finds Sheldon washing Howard's panties. Sheldon explains that he is being punished for being, according to Howard, a \\"condescending jerk\\", and asks Penny if she thinks he is condescending. Penny agrees with Howard. Howard shows Bernadette a picture of Sheldon wearing the French maid costume. She thinks Howard is being too cruel and says that Sheldon is unaware of how mean he is. Howard agrees to stop making Sheldon perform tasks. Howard's mother interrupts to remind Bernadette that they made plans to go dress shopping; Bernadette says that she cannot make it, but that Sheldon will accompany her instead. Sheldon is forced to go shopping with Mrs. Wolowitz. Sheldon's final task is to give Howard a compliment about his work: he says that Howard is good at his job, although Sheldon does not consider his work to be \\"worth doing\\". Howard reveals that he gave Hawking the paper three days ago. Sheldon finally gets to meet Hawking in person. When they meet, Hawking points out an arithmetic error in Sheldon's paper that makes the whole paper incorrect: at this, a shocked Sheldon faints. Production Professor Stephen Hawking appears at the end of the episode. Stephen Hawking has been mentioned several times on the show, including in the Pilot. Hawking has appeared on comedy television shows previously: he did the voice-over for cartoon versions of himself in Futurama, and in four episodes of The Simpsons. On March 9, 2012, Bill Prady announced that a \\"super-secret, super-cool guest star\\" would appear on the show. On March 12, 2012, CBS announced that Hawking would be guest starring on the show on April 5. Photos of Hawking's appearance were published by The Hollywood Reporter on April 2. Hawking had been asked to appear on the show previously but was too ill to do so. Bill Prady stated that Stephen Hawking was always their \\"dream guest star\\" for the show, but that Hawking appearing was \\"a long shot of astronomical proportions\\". Hawking was a fan of The Big Bang Theory and requested to watch a rehearsal of the episode after filming his scene. Simon Helberg, who plays Howard, does an impression of Hawking's voice in the episode; he felt slightly uncomfortable mimicking Hawking, but Hawking seemed to enjoy the impression. Hawking is the third high-profile guest star to appear in season 5, after Mike Massimino and Leonard Nimoy. Hawking later appeared in the season 6 episode \\"The Extract Obliteration\\", the season 7 episode \\"The Relationship Diremption\\" and the season 8 episode \\"The Troll Manifestation\\", but in these episodes only his voice is heard. Hawking was shown in a pre-recorded video segment at the Big Bang Theory panel at Comic-Con 2013. He apologized for not being there in person and sang the show's theme tune. Following \\"The Hawking Excitation\\", there was a three-week break before the next episode, \\"The Stag Convergence\\", aired. Reception =Ratings= On the night of its first broadcast on CBS on April 5, 2012, the episode was watched by 13.29 million U.S. households and received a Nielsen rating of 4.2/14 among viewers aged between 18 and 49 (meaning that 4.2% of 18‚Äì49 years olds watched the episode).

Carla Day from TV Fanatic gave the episode a very positive review, describing it as \\"Possibly, the best episode. Ever.\\" and giving it the maximum possible editor rating (5.0). Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B‚Äì. Sava complimented Hawking's line, \\"it was quite a boner\\", calling it \\"the big pay-off of the story\\" and enjoyed the scene with Bernadette. However, Sava also said the \\"personal slave\\" storyline was a \\"classic sitcom plot\\" and noted that it was \\"the second episode in a row with no Amy\\". R. L.

Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, excerpts available online.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 86-87 According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, Djedkheperew was the 17th king of this dynasty. Djedkheperew is this pharaoh's Horus name; the prenomen and nomen of Djedkheperew, which would normally be employed by modern conventions to name a pharaoh, are unknown. __FORCETOC__ Attestations ;Contemporary attestations The reign of Djedkheperew is supported by eleven seal impressions from Egyptian fortresses at the second cataract in Nubia. Ten of these seal impressions were found at Uronarti in close association with seal impressions of Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Maaibre Sheshi.Kim Ryholt: The Date of Kings Sheshi and Yaqubhar and the Rise of the Fourteenth Dynasty, in The Second Intermediate Period (Thirteenth-Seventeenth Dynasties), Current Research, Future Prospects, Marcel Maree ed., Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta 192, Leuven, Peeters, 2010, pp. 109‚Äì126 The last one was discovered in Mirgissa. Besides the seal impressions, Djedkheperew is authenticated by the Bed of Osiris, a massive sculpture of black basalt showing Osiris lying on a bier. The Bed of Osiris was found in the tomb of the 1st Dynasty pharaoh Djer, which the ancient Egyptians had come to identify with the tomb of Osiris. The sculpture is now in the Egyptian Museum. The sculpture was tentatively attributed to another 13th Dynasty pharaoh, Khendjer, by Leahy, but recent examinations of the inscriptions proved that it originally bore the name of Djedkheperew. The nomen of Djedkheperew was erased at some point in antiquity, but carelessly enough that some of it is still readable. ;On the Turin canon Djedkheperew is not mentioned on the Turin canon, a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period, which serves as a reference document for the history of the Second Intermediate Period. Ryholt argues that this is because Djedkheperew's reign (as well as that of his predecessor, Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and immediate successor(s) Sebkay, all absent from the canon) was already lost in a lacuna of the document from which the canon was copied. That this must be true is indicated by artifacts showing that Khabaw succeeded Hor on the throne and Sebkay as a predecessor(s) of Amenemhat VII, when the canon lists Amenemhat VII directly as Hor's successor (column 7, lines 17 and 18). Family and reign According to Ryholt, Djedkheperew was a brother of his predecessor Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and a son of pharaoh Hor Awibre. Ryholt based his conclusion on the seals from Uronarti and the Bed of Osiris. The seals show that Khabaw and Djedkheperew reigned closely in time, while what remains of the name of Djedkheperew on the Bed of Osiris shows that his nomen started with hrw. This suggests that Djedkheperew's nomen indicated his filiation to Hor. Since Khabaw is known to have succeeded Hor, Ryholt deduced that Djedkheperew was Khabaw's brother and successor.

She first appeared in the series sixteen episode \\"Fait Accompli\\", broadcast on 3 December 2013. Colette serves as the Director of Nursing Services at Holby City. Delamere was approached for the role and not required to audition. Colette is characterised as a \\"headstrong\\" and \\"compassionate\\" career woman who fiercely defends her team of nursing staff. Delamere decided that Colette should not have children to represent independent woman. But her solitary trait often leaves her isolated. Colette was introduced as an old friend of CEO Guy Self (John Michie). He offers the job without interviewing her which attracts internal scrutiny. Colette's role at the hospital demands respect from those in nursing roles. While she also maintains influence to reprimand doctors and consultants operating mistreating nurses. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror predicted viewer popularity for Colette. She liked her brash persona and reporters from Inside Soap and What's on TV called her a \\"no-nonsense\\" character. Development =Casting= On 28 August 2013, the BBC released a statement detailing Delamere's casting as Colette Sheward. They revealed that the character would be introduced as the Director of Nursing. Billed as \\"tough-talking, politically incorrect, funny and loyal\\", Colette's inclusion would see the show's nursing team garner her fierce support. Delamere stated that she was pleased to join Holby City as such a \\"surprising and funny character\\". She was not required to audition for the role as she was directly approached by the production team. The actress was unsure that she wanted to role until she read the character breakdown. Colette's witty personality appealed to Delamere and she took the role on. In October 2014, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that Delamere would be leaving the show. =Characterisation= Colette is characterised as a smart and compassionate nurse with a sense of humour. She conducts herself with a headstrong approach. But she is a \\"dark horse\\" with firm boundaries and refuses to let others get too close. Delamere told Kirsty Nutkins of the Daily Express that she is foremost a career woman and a \\"bit of a warrior\\". She makes it her duty to defend and speak in favour the hospital's nursing staff. But Colette demands respect from those who rank below her even if they are unwilling to show her any. Delamere explained that this trait \\"leads to some quite interesting confrontations.\\" Colette holds high regard for authenticity in her staff because she dislikes phoniness. She tends to inspire while leading her team - but her solitary manner and reluctance to ask for help can make her feel isolated. Despite her strong personality, Colette is not \\"strident or bitchy\\". Delamere based Colette's persona on her Aunt Jac, a nurse during the 1960s who \\"called a spade a spade\\" in her approach to work. Colette also sees herself as a role model to other women. Delamere explained that her character is a single and successful career woman who chose not to have children. She is unapologetic about her lifestyle and champions other women. She also noted that \\"she hasn't allowed life's challenges and disappointments to make her hard or bitter. Producers let Delamere decide that Colette should not have any children. She read a statistic that one in five British women aged over forty were not mothers and wanted to represent the \\"footloose and fancy-free\\" minority. =Introduction and Guy Self= Colette debuts during the episode \\"Fait Accompli\\", broadcast on 3 December 2013. She arrives at the hospital a brain tumour patient named Sam Cummings (Daniel Abbott). Then it becomes clear that Colette previously worked with CEO Guy Self John Michie at another hospital. Delamere told Katy Moon [Inside Soap] that Colette has been estranged from Guy following the death of his wife. But Colette knows that he is the only one who can perform the necessary operation to save Sam's life. It is following a successful operation performed on Sam, which Colette orchestrated that Guy offers Colette a role at Holby City. She is hesitant and unsure of the offer; Delamere explained that Colette does not entirely trust Guy or know where he is at mentally. Their relationship had become \\"fraught\\" while he was grieving. Michie told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that hiring Colette was a part of Guy's plan to establish his power over the hospital. Colette's first storyline block mainly involved working alongside Guy. Delamere told Natalie Dye from TV Choice that she and Michie instantly got on well. This worked well as the characters have a shared history. But their relationship is platonic and Delamere believed that any romance would ruin their \\"great working relationship\\". She added that they were trying to create a \\"more interesting\\" dynamic through the pair being \\"good friends\\". Michie explained that Colette is the only character that does not get reprimanded for speaking to him out of turn. Colette \\"knocks him off his pedestal\\" and humanises him via their friendship. She later suggested that the duo would make \\"great enemies\\" because they know each so well. Delamere soon revealed that the two would become estranged. Colette will find herself embroiled in a \\"stubborn spat\\" with Guy and his daughter Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson) when she defends a colleague and defies \\"the point of principle\\". =Fletch= It was later announced that Adrian Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw), a character from related series Casualty, would be joining Holby City. Producer Oliver Kent said that he envisioned a new male nurse who could \\"lock horns\\" with Colette. The pair are already acquainted and have \\"unresolved issues\\" which makes Fletch's new job complicated. A writer from Virgin Media said that Colette \\"will go out of her way to make his life difficult\\". Delamere later revealed that the new arrival would be \\"an unwelcome blast from the past who gets under Colette‚Äôs skin!\\" Walkinshaw told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that Fletch was once engaged to Colette and their re-acquaintance on AAU is their first since their break-up. It comes as a shock to them both and it becomes apparent that there is a mixture of tension, banter and bickering between them. The actor added that there is some unresolved romantic feeling between them. Walkinshaw added that Colette does not like the fact that Fletch assumes the role ward manager and becomes her boss while on AAU. Delamere told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Guy employs Fletch to annoy Colette. He knows that she stood Fletch up on their wedding day. But they later get on because there is \\"great chemistry\\" between them. Delamere believed that Colette and Fletch were good together and that she should have married him. But Colette decided to leave him because she wanted to experience relationships with different men. Storylines Colette arrives at Holby City hospital to ask Guy to perform an operation on her brain tumour patient Sam. She explains that Sam's original surgeon would not operate and convinces Guy to go ahead with the successful operation. Guy offers Colette the Director of Nursing role which she accepts. Colette notices that Mary-Claire Carter (Niamh McGrady) is upset with Edward's treatment of her. She offers her support. The board become concerned that Colette did not undergo a supervised interview and may not meet the role requirements. Colette is later confronted by the human resources department who observe her methods of nursing. But Colette gets to keep her job. Colette supports Guy through troubled times with Zosia and tries to make peace between them. Colette creates a new role for Jonny Maconie (Michael Thomson) and clashes with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) over the treatment of her nurses. Guy becomes angry with Colette for keeping Zosia's romance with Jesse Law (Don Gilet) a secret. He employs Fletch as the new AAU ward manager to get revenge. Colette is annoyed by his presence because she left him on their wedding day. They argue with each other but it becomes clear that they still care for each other. Colette tries to make plan an evening with Guy but he declines in favour of Jac leaving her jealous. Reception Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror predicted that viewers would \\"love Colette\\" due to her outspoken nature. She particularly liked her blunt attitude shown towards Harry Tressler (Jules Knight) and Guy all in her debut episode. Though Simon has criticised Colette not being interviewed for her job and her \\"not so catchy\\" self coined nickname the \\"Colletinator\\". Reporters from Inside Soap and What's on TV branded Colette a \\"no-nonsense\\" type character. Upon witnessing Colette clashing with Jac, a South Wales Echo reporter quipped \\"the Colette-Jac mind games are so frosty they could be an event in the Winter Olympics\\".

It serves to connect Edgefield and Batesburg-Leesville with Columbia via U.S. Route 1 (US 1). Route description SC 23 is a two-lane rural highway that travels from Modoc, within the Sumter National Forest and near Lake Strom Thurmond, to Batesburg-Leesville. The highway travels through mostly either forest or farmland, while connecting with the city and towns of Edgefield, Johnston, Ward, Ridge Spring and Monetta. Between Monetta and Batesburg-Leesville, SC 23 parallels to the north of US 1. History The first SC 23 was an original state highway that traveled from SC 3 in Pee Dee, through Latta and Dillon, becoming NC 23 at the North Carolina state line near Rowland. In 1927, US 217 was assigned on the entire route; after a year, SC 23 was decommissioned. The second, and current, SC 23 was established around 1929, traveling from SC 39 in Monetta to US 1 in Leesville. In 1936, SC 23 was extended west to its current western terminus in Modoc, replacing part of SC 39\\\\. Junction list Edgefield truck route South Carolina Highway 25 Truck (SC 25 Truck) is a truck route that is partially within the western and northeastern parts of Edgefield. It has concurrencies with U.S. Route 25 Truck (US 25 Truck; actually the US 25 mainline signed as a truck route), US 25 Bus., SC 430 Conn., and SC 430\\\\. Unlike some truck routes, it is well marked along its path. The truck route begins at an intersection with the SC 23 mainline. Here, the truck route travels to the north-northwest, concurrent with US 25 Truck (US 25). They curve to the north-northeast and cross over Beaverdam Creek. They curve back to the north-northwest and leave the city limits of Edgefield. They curve back to the north-northeast. At an intersection with US 25 and US 25 Bus., SC 23 Truck turns right onto the business route. The two highways travel to the southeast. At an intersection with Crest Road, SC 23 Truck splits off to the southeast, concurrent with the unsigned SC 430 Conn., while US 25 Bus. bends to the south-southeast. Then, they re-enter Edgefield. One block later, the two highways intersect Meeting Street, the northbound lanes of which is SC 430 north; the southbound lanes lead to US 25 Bus. south. At this intersection, SC 430 Conn. ends, and SC 23 Truck begins a concurrency with SC 430\\\\. The two highways take Crest Road to the southeast. They curve to the east-southeast and leave Edgefield again. They curve to the southeast and reach their terminus, an intersection with SC 23\\\\.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Saint John, New Brunswick. Saint John was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 28 May 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 25 August later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 13 December 1943 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda in January 1944, Saint John returned to Halifax where she was stationed for a while. In April 1944, she transferred to escort group EG 9 based out of Derry. She participated in Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Invasion of Normandy. On 1 September 1944, Saint John in tandem with , sank southeast of Land's End in the English Channel. The battle took twenty-four hours before wreckage came up to confirm the kill. In December 1944, she escorted two Russian convoys, JW 62 to Kola Inlet and RA 62 from. On 16 February 1945 she sank east of Moray Firth in Scotland. On 27 February 1945, Saint John arrived at Cardiff to undergo repairs, which took until April to complete. After the repairs were completed, she sailed for Canada to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration, water-cooling capabilities and a change to her camouflage pattern. The refit began in May 1945 at Saint John and was completed in October of that year. She was paid off 27 November 1945 at Halifax and laid up in Bedford Basin. In 1947 she was sold for scrapping and taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia to be broken up.

Occurring from April 4, 1968, to April 12, 1968, members of the University Christian Movement began planning a campus-wide vigil in memoriam of Dr. King. Another group of undergraduate students called for a protest march to address prevalent issues concerning the primarily African-American nonacademic employees at Duke in Local 77. Together, both student groups, along with the support of Local 77, most of the teaching faculty, and civilians not affiliated with the university, sparked a non-violent demonstration that involved over 2,000 participants, making it the largest in Duke's history.William E. King, If Gargoyles Could Talk: Sketches of Duke University (Durham: Carolina Academy Press, 1997). The Silent Vigil stands out from other contemporary college movements due to the collaboration between primarily white students and faculty, and mainly African-American workers. Furthermore, unlike rowdier protests at the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University, Duke's Silent Vigil received considerable praise for its peaceful approach, especially considering its surrounding Southern backdrop. Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, the Silent Vigil not only aimed to externally change Duke's white, privileged, and apathetic image in the eyes of the Durham community, but also internally set a powerful precedent on Duke's campus for student activism in the future.  Background and motivation  On November 13, 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered a speech about the Civil Rights Movement at Duke University, declaring that \\"[Human progress] comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals who are willing to be coworkers with God...The time is always right to do what is right.\\"'\\"Audio of King's 1964 Speech at Duke,\\" http://mlk.duke.edu/audio.html. So many white and black students, faculty, workers, and administrators showed up that campus organizers had to put the speech on loudspeakers so that the overflow audience could listen outside on the Main Quad. Inviting the leader of the Civil Rights Movement to speak marked the university's progress in terms of race relations. Until 1963, Duke had been a university solely for white students; the only black people on campus were the nonacademic workers who served students and faculty. King came during a time when Duke was starting to take part in the activism that had already taken place at many of its contemporary institutions in the North and West. In 1962, six years prior to the Reverend's speech at Duke University, the university's graduate schools had finally desegregated according to a vote by the Board of Trustees; one year later, five African-American undergraduates matriculated at Duke.\\"Celebrating the Past, Charting the Future: Commemorating 50 Years of Black Students at Duke University,\\" http://spotlight.duke.edu/50years/#black-history. In 1966, Samuel DuBois Cook became the first tenured black faculty member,\\"African-American Firsts at Duke University,\\" http://spotlight.duke.edu/50years/african-american-firsts-at- duke-university/. while an undergraduate group called the Afro-American Society was unofficially established to advocate for the rights of black students.Harry R. Jackson, \\"Coverage in University Publications of Events on Campus from February 13 to March 19\\", May 27, 1969, Box 1, Folder 18, Allen Building Takeover Collection, 1969-2002, Rubenstein Library, Duke University, http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uaallenbldg/#abtms01018 Around that same time, African-American nonacademic workers had begun to come together through AFSCME Local 77, an unrecognized union, to picket for better working conditions. Still, despite making racial progress in terms of bringing African-American students and faculty to Duke, several problems remained: namely, the university's relationship with its African-American nonacademic workers, and a prevalent sense of racist attitudes among Duke's administration. For example, workers were required to address white undergraduates as 'Mister' and 'Miss', clean the bedrooms of the male students (because female students supposedly did not need domestic help), and eat their meals in the kitchen rather than the dining hall.Tony Dunbar, \\"The Old South Triumphs at Duke,\\" Southern Changes (1979): 5-8. However, the most grievous issues the university administration neglected to address were the lack of a formally recognized union for workers as well as the meager wage the school was paying its nonacademic staff. In the 1960s, colleges and universities were exempt from the federal minimum wage of $1.60. This gave Duke leeway to pay its employees well under the recommended, $1.60 minimum salary; in fact, some Duke workers reported to earning less than a $1.15 minimum salary. In 1965, Oliver Harvey, a black janitor at Duke, organized the Duke Employees Benevolent Society (DEBS) to advocate for higher pay, improved conditions, and nicer benefits. DEBS became Local 77 of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, affiliated with AFL-CIO. However, the university administration still chose not to recognize Local 77 as a union or grant collective bargaining rights to its workers.\\"Duke Employees' Organizing Efforts\\", The Herald-Sun (2013). While past Duke students ignored these problems, they were not to be overlooked by the students in the 1960s, many of whom grew up alongside the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King inspired many students Adam Eaglin, \\"Black and White: A History,\\" The Chronicle (2005). when he spoke of the national shift towards racial equality, proclaiming, \\"And so I can still sing as we sing in our movement, all over the South and all over the nation, 'We Shall Overcome!'\\"\\"Audio of King's 1964 Speech at Duke,\\" http://mlk.duke.edu/audio.html. Later, during the Silent Vigil, participants would join hands to sing \\"We Shall Overcome\\" as a tribute to the Reverend and his legacy in the Civil Rights Movement.  The vigil  On Friday, April 5, 1968, the vigil began in front of the Duke Chapel on West Campus at noon. Three hours later, around 450 students and faculty marched through the rain to Duke President Douglas Knight's house.Sympathy March Flyer, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Those protestors would remain in Knight's house for the next several days. Saturday afternoon, they were joined by another group of about 350 faculty, workers, and students from Duke and North Carolina College, a black university. Later that evening, after multiple discussions with the students that lasted several hours, an exhausted President Knight was removed from all negotiations by his doctor due to fears of stress-related medical complications from his previous case of hepatitis. Acknowledging Knight's illness, the protestors moved back to West Campus' main quad on Sunday morning. Later that night, dining hall and custodial workers at Duke declared an official strike for the upcoming days. Protestors supported the strike and continued the Vigil on the main quad, camping out day and night, while boycotting classes and the dining hall. As more and more students joined the Vigil, professors helped them (and their grades) by holding their own classes on the quad.  The protestors  = Vigil leadership and support = The Silent Vigil was led by a committee of ten. (All names are listed alphabetically.) The original negotiating team comprised Dave Birkhead (editor of the Duke Chronicle student newspaper), Huck Guttman, Jon Kinney (president of the student body), Margaret (Bunny) Small, and Asst. Prof. John Strange (Duke political science department), negotiating with Dean of Students William Griffiths. Once the Vigil began in earnest at the home of Duke University President Douglas Knight, Kinney, Small, and Strange were joined by six undergraduates and one faculty member: Dave Birkhead rejoined, and Jack Boger, David Henderson, Reid Kramer, Alan Ray, Prof. Tom Rainey, and James (Jeff) van Pelt were added, a total of eight undergraduates and two faculty members.http://dukemagazine.duke.edu/article/remembering-the-vigil-a- university-milestone Bertie Howard, an African American student advisor to the leadership, challenged the leaders to conduct an orderly vigil, leading to the idea of the Silent Vigil. Members of the University Christian Movement instrumental in planning the accompanying protest march, included the Rev. Helen Crotwell, Chris Dame, Jim Davis, Tom Garrison, the Rev. Elmer Hall, Tami Hultman, Jon Kernodle, the Rev. Nancy Richardson, and George Vlasits. Other principal faculty supporters of the Vigil included Prof. Jim Garrison (History), Prof. Jim Hart (political science), and Prof. Fred Krantz (history).https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/12394/anewgenesissilen00sega-1.pdf?sequence=3 Over the time of the Silent Vigil nearly the entire Duke student body and a significant portion of the faculty participated, as well as students from neighboring universities. The majority of the Duke students who participated were white, as was the student body.Sam DuBois Cook, Remembering the Vigil: A University Milestone, comp. Bridget Booher (Durham: Duke Magazine, 1998). More than three-quarters of the protesters had never participated in any demonstration before. The Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU), Duke's student government, showed its support by postponing elections so students could focus on the demonstration.ASDU Election Postponed Flyer, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Also, Duke's Interfraternity Council (IFC), the Duke Law School, and the Duke Divinity School formerly endorsed the Silent Vigil.Duke Law School Statement, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. = Local 77 = AFSCME Local 77, the union for Duke's nonacademic employees, stemmed from its unsuccessful predecessor, the Duke Employees Benevolent Society (created in 1965), which was formed for a number of Duke service employees to protect workers from unfair conditions and obtain wage increases. The majority of the members were African-American and were not only angered by the blatant racial discrimination they faced, but also their salary, which was significantly lower than the national $1.60/hour federal minimum wage. Due to Duke's unilateral policy making, the voices of the nonacademic employees were not considered. Thus, collective bargaining, a set of procedures that aims to increase equitability between labor and management, was the only remaining option for University workers to receive fair treatment. After realizing the need for collective bargaining in order to improve conditions, Local 77 affiliated with the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and AFL-CIO. However, in the fall of 1967, Local 77, AFSCME, and AFL-CIO disbanded. Duke employees reorganized as the United Public and Service Employees Local 77, which was independent and non- affiliated.Statement by Local 77 Concerning Collective Bargaining at Duke, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Local 77 was committed to nonviolence, advocating its demands through peaceful rallies, strikes, and picket lines. It demonstrated such a mindset when its employees went on a strike that ran parallel to the Vigil. Unfortunately, Duke's administration did not recognize Local 77 in the beginning, stating that it could protect the welfare of its workers better than any union. However, the administration did not stay true to its word and continued to ignore the harassment of its nonacademic employees. In response to its workers being neglected and unfairly treated, Local 77 began to take more action by filing multiple grievances and writing to The Chronicle. In the spring of 1967, union members began picketing outside of Duke's administrative building as well as its medical center. While the school administration was extremely slow on resolving the issues, Duke students and faculty began to take note. The increased student and faculty awareness of the plight of nonacademic workers as well as their protesting efforts led to the Silent Vigil.Dunbar, \\"The Old South Triumphs at Duke,\\" 5-8.  The demands  In the beginning of the Silent Vigil, the students presented four demands for Duke administration to consider: one, the placement of an advertisement in the Durham Morning Herald calling for a day of mourning for Dr. King; two, a $1.60 minimum wage for all Duke employees be established; three, that Duke President Douglas Knight resign from his membership in the Hope Valley Country Club; and four, the appointment of a committee to design a method of collective bargaining for workers. Later, over the course of the demonstration, two more demands were added: the creation of an exchange program with North Carolina College; and increased presence of African-American professors.David M. Henderson, A Journal of the Duke Vigil, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. = Public condolences in the Durham Morning Herald = The Durham Morning Herald was the local paper that began publication in 1893. After merging with The Durham Sun, it is now called The Herald-Sun. At the time of the Silent Vigil, The Durham Morning Herald was regarded as the primary local news source. Duke students believed that the printing of a statement by President Knight saying, \\"'We are all implicated' in the assassination of King\\"Bridget Booher, Remembering the Vigil: A University Milestone (Durham: Duke Magazine, 1998). would serve as a powerful symbol that Durham as a whole was moving forward in racial acceptance. = Raising the minimum wage = At the time, the federal minimum wage was set at $1.60. The minimum wage for colleges and universities was $1.15. However, Duke paid many of its employees far less. Many considered the discrepancy to be a byproduct of racial prejudice, as most of the nonacademic employees at Duke were African-American. The implication of discrimination angered workers and students at Duke, leading them to protest for change. = Boycotting Hope Valley Country Club = Situated between Durham and Chapel Hill, Hope Valley Country Club was founded in 1926. In A Journal of the Duke Vigil, David M. Henderson recalls how Hope Valley was a heavily discriminatory \\"symbol of wealthy white dominance,\\" only allowing white members to take advantage of its facilities.\\"Experience the Tradition and History of Hope Valley Country Club,\\" www.hvcc.org/life Many Duke administrators were patrons at the Hope Valley Country Club. As the Civil Rights Movement progressed, their Hope Valley membership irked more and more students, who criticized the racial discrimination practiced by the country club. President Knight stated that \\"he would work to change the rules of the club, and that if he had not accomplished anything in 18 months, he would resign.\\"Minutes for Academic Council, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. = Appointment of a committee to implement collective bargaining = As Duke's administration was a very bureaucratic institution, students and employers realized that the most effective way to implement policy change on Duke's campus was to create a committee to analyze and plan collective bargaining for Local 77 workers. This committee would not only survey the relationship between Duke's employees and the administration, but also draft out an executive proposal to introduce collective bargaining to Duke's campus. = Access to Duke University for North Carolina College students = In the 1960s, North Carolina College, now known as North Carolina Central University, was a private institution for African-American students. Today, while its students are still primarily black, it is open to all races. Up into the early 1960s, Duke's premier educational resources were only allowed for white students. Finally on March 8, 1961, Duke's Board of Trustees voted to allow black students to matriculate into the university. The following year, four African-American graduate students enrolled at Duke. In 1963, five African- American undergraduates enrolled. However, although Duke's administration was making gradual policy changes in accordance with the Civil Rights Movement, Duke students were bothered with the fact that the majority of black college students still did not have access to the level of educational resources that Duke offered. Since North Carolina College had not yet attained the academic status that Duke had because it was still a relatively young university, Duke students wanted to reach out to North Carolina College students to give them an opportunity to utilize Duke resources. = More African Americans on faculty = Duke University's faculty was largely white. During the time preceding the Vigil, only a few Duke faculty members were African-American. The Afro-American Society had been requesting, without success, that the African-American Studies Department be established in the curriculum for about a year prior to the Vigil. Other students on campus recognized the racial unbalance in the makeup of the Duke faculty as well.  The aftermath  = Short-term effects = On Friday, April 12, 1968, about 2,000 students moved off the main quad, declaring an end to the Silent Vigil. Four days later, the nonacademic employee strike ended when the Board of Trustees announced its intended appointment of the Special Trustee-Administrative Committee, which would be responsible for studying the relationship between the university and its workers and make appropriate policy recommendations. However, the campus movement against university discrimination was far from over; students, faculty, and workers eagerly awaited the decisions of Duke's administration. Eventually, Duke's Board of Trustees heeded one of the students' requests and created the Special Trustee-Administration Committee, which was responsible for surveying the current standing of Local 77 employees and deciding on a proper tactic to address the problems. On April 20, 1968, the committee released a statement saying, \\"We will be at the $1.60 minimum hourly rate [for all nonacademic employees] by July 1, 1969.\\"Statement of Special Trustee- Administrative Committee, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. As for President Knight, he did end up resigning from Hope Valley Country Club. In 1992, Hope Valley admitted its first black member. However, Knight did not write the advertisement in the Durham Morning Herald showing condolences for Martin Luther King's death. As for increased faculty diversity, Duke began hiring more and more black professors within the decade following the Silent Vigil, including professor of psychiatry, James Carter, and professor of pediatrics, Brenda Armstrong. = Long-term impacts = The Silent Vigil played a huge role in redefining Duke's external image within the Durham African-American community as well as setting an important internal precedent for student activism down the line. Even though \\"stories about the 'Silent Vigil' were not carried in newspapers across the country,\\"Segal, Theodore. \\"'A New Genesis': The 'Silent Vigil' at Duke University, April 5th-12th, 1968.\\" Duke University Senior Honors Paper, 1977. the demonstration attempted to show \\"to Black America that White America still cares and still acts with deeds not words.\\"A Brief Statement from the Leaders of the Vigil, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Professor Samuel Dubois Cook stated to the Vigil participants, \\"I and other Negroes can go on hoping and believing in the promise of America; we can go on believing that we are going to be free someday because of people like you and all other members of this magnificent vigil.\\"Transcript of Address of Samuel Dubois Cook, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Furthermore, the Silent Vigil set a new standard for student activism on campus. As Professor John Cell noted, \\"The image Duke had of itself and the kind of people who were in positions of power changed.\\"John Cell, Remembering the Vigil: A University Milestone, comp. Bridget Booher (Durham: Duke Magazine, 1998). It showed students, black and white alike, that administrative change, even in a Southern university, could be implemented and initiated by the students and for the students. As University Archivist, William E. King, notes, \\"[The Silent Vigil's] greatest significance lay in the choice it delineated for those living in the tumultuous year of 1968. The old order clearly was changing. Did one react by supporting traditional values and the status quo or did one grasp at growth and change.\\" Such a difference in reacting to campus inequalities was demonstrated by the Allen Building Takeover in 1969, when students in the Afro-American Society took control of Duke's main administrative building to advocate for their rights as students. The criticism from alumni and trustees resulting from the buildup of student- administration conflict eventually caused President Douglas Knight to resign.  Reactions to the Silent Vigil  Reactions to the Silent Vigil were mixed, largely due to interesting demographic differences. Many students believed that the Vigil was necessary and crucial in bringing about change on campus. According to a poll of the dorms on West Campus, many of the students were in favor of demands listed by the leaders of the Silent Vigil.Dorm Polls, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. As for the nonacademic workers in Local 77, many of them were grateful towards the support shown by the student protestors. In fact, the employees who went on strike stated that they were \\"inspired by the commitment and determination students have shown in their fight ‚Äì at a time when many black people have lost their faith that poverty and exploitation can be eliminated and that the white majority really cares.\\"Dining Hall Strike Poster, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Meanwhile, the older population looked at the Silent Vigil with more skepticism. Professor John Cell also notes that \\"There was a real generational divide.\\" Because many older people were involved with Duke's administration, President Knight definitely had a tough time appealing to two very different constituencies ‚Äì his students and his coworkers. Knight recalls, \\"I had to fight against some pretty reactionary opinions among senior administrators who felt that we should pay [those employees] as little as we could, using appalling language and so forth. There were a great many members of the Duke constituency who didn't care whether Martin Luther King lived or died; they felt he was disruptive‚Ä¶I was much younger than my peers‚Ä¶I was a prisoner.\\"Douglas Knight, Remembering the Vigil: A University Milestone, comp. Bridget Booher (Durham: Duke Magazine, 1998). Among professors, the reaction towards the Vigil varied quite a bit. According to Professor John Cell, \\"Because of the Vigil, the history department split and it was extremely bitter for about three or four years, in some cases longer than that. That was typical of so many departments, especially in the social sciences and humanities.\\" However, the faculty involved in the Academic Council did release a statement saying \\"it was appropriate that the faculty should examine [the relationship between the University and its nonacademic employees] for two reasons (1) our own welfare is related to the welfare of the nonacademic employees to the extent that our salaries and theirs do eventually come from the same funds, and (2) in terms of conscience we should be concerned with the distress of other members of the University community.\\"Academic Council Minutes, Box 1, Duke Vigil Collection, 1968-1988, Rubenstein Library, Duke University.  Criticism and praise  Like any other major historical event, the Silent Vigil received its fair share of criticism and praise. Most criticisms of the Vigil pointed towards the protestors' choice to remain at President Knight's house for an extended period of time. Mary D.B.T. Semans, a University Trustee during the Vigil, stated, \\"I have always felt, however, that the occupation of President Knight's house was in error and took away from the 'purity' of the cause. It was a violation of his rights.\\"Mary Semans, Remembering the Vigil: A University Milestone, comp. Bridget Booher (Durham: Duke Magazine, 1998). Others, like student Christopher Edgar, criticized the Vigil's motives, saying that \\"Certainly, the university had a duty to its employees as well‚Ä¶[but] the welfare of the student body at large should come first.\\"Christopher Edgar, Remembering the Vigil: A University Milestone, comp. Bridget Booher (Durham: Duke Magazine, 1998). He asserted that the university had a priority to make education affordable by its students; increasing the wage for nonacademic workers would only serve to make Duke's tuition more expensive. Another criticism of Silent Vigil was directed towards its lack of thematic coherency, as there seemingly was no connection between the assassination of Dr. King and the strike by the employees. The Silent Vigil received praise for its nonviolent approach, which was quite different from contemporary riots at the University of California Berkeley or Columbia University. The difference in protest style was largely correlated to geographical factors, as Berkeley and Columbia were in the more liberal regions of the West and North, respectively, while Duke was in the South. Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC) organizer Sue Thrasher pointed out, \\"People [in the South] knew they didn't have the numbers. On southern campuses [in the mid-1960s] people were well aware that they were a minority‚Ä¶speaking out. And so your tactics had to be a little bit more moderated. And so you had to think about safety and sustaining yourself over time.\\" William Griffith, the assistant to the provost for student affairs at the time of the demonstration, noted, \\"it's a lot easier to do physical violence to something because you're responding to your emotions and you get immediate gratification. And [the Silent Vigil] was slow gratification, and it took discipline to do that. I have a great deal of respect for the leadership that made it happen that way. It really was special to Duke and to higher education; nothing like it happened anywhere else in the country.\\"Robert Cohen and David Snyder, Rebellion in Black and White: Southern Student Activism in the 1960s (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013).

The determination is established through a series of filings from the utility to the PSC and hearings conducted by the PSC. This occurs during a prudency hearing. The PSC follows these standards to determine if the capital costs were a \\"prudent investment\\". To determine the prudency of the investment, the PSC applies the prudent investment test or standard, determining if the costs were reasonable at the time they were incurred, and given the circumstances and what was known or knowable at the time, are to be included in the firm's rates. It is commonly used as an oversight tool by the government to ensure that money invested into a project is being spent as it was intended so the utility may recoup some costs in construction through a recovery in rates, hence the title prudent investment rule. Regulators can consider cases of hidden imprudence, but are required to consider what was known or knowable at the time the decision was made by the PSC. The term Prudent Investment Rule, and the associated standards, have been established through a series of legal precedents. The first case to set precedent was the United States Supreme Court case of Munn v. Illinois in 1877, which allowed states to have a say in rates. Once the nature of recoverable capital costs was defined, a second question remained as to the rate at which that capital could be recovered. This issue was reasonably addressed in 1935 in Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, when the court said that a public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties. Advantages of Rate of Return Regulation with Prudent Investment Rule Rate-of-return Regulation is a system for setting the prices charged by government-regulated monopolies, such as utility companies. There are several advantages to using rate-of-return regulation. The first is that it is sustainable if there is no competition because prices can be adjusted to the company‚Äôs changing conditions. It can also provide comfort to investors because rate-of-return regulation constrains the regulator‚Äôs discretion in setting prices. This lowers investor risk, which lowers the cost of capital. Company profits can be kept within acceptable levels from the perspectives of both investors and customers. Unless the regulator chronically underestimates the cost of capital (and courts do not reverse the regulator in this regard), investors can be confident they have a fair opportunity to receive the profits they expect and thus are willing to make investments. Customers can observe that the regulator is limiting company profits to the cost of capital. Disallowance According to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, there are five categories that plants under construction may fall into that keep them from being included in the rate base. # Imprudence: When a utility fails to show that it made prudent decisions in Public Service Commission hearings, then the facility being reviewed is disallowed from the rate base. # Excess Capacity: Regardless of prudence, a plant recently constructed may not be included in the rate base if it is ruled to have a generating capacity that is in excess of what is needed by the ratepayers. Each jurisdiction will calculate excess capacity differently. This is not a permanent disallowance and if the need of the customer or ratepayer grows then the plant can again be included in the rate base. # Cost Caps: In rare cases the Public Utilities Commission will set a cap on construction costs for a new facility. If the plant is completed at a higher cost, then this excess cost may not be allowed in the rate base. # Economic Value: The actual economic value of the recently constructed plant may be found to be less than the construction costs. A plant under construction should be regularly evaluated to ensure that continued construction is in the best interest of the ratepayer. # Other: This category includes any other reason that a facility may be disallowed from the rate base. This includes canceled construction. If a plant is canceled then it is not ‚Äúused and useful‚Äù and may be completely disallowed from the rate base or allowed to recover prudent costs with no return recovery on the balance or allowed to recover prudent costs with a recovery of the debt return from the unrecovered balance.

The peasants of the Palatinate region had previously joined the uprising in southwest Germany against high taxes and attacked, plundered, and devastated the estates of the nobility and the monasteries.  Causes  The Battle of Pfeddersheim was part of the Palatine Peasants' War of 1525. The unrest amongst the peasants and townsfolk in and around Worms began before 29 April 1525 and reached its zenith in May that year. They demanded that the town authorities comply with 13 articles and make concessions within four days. These articles were related to three areas: first, in the religious sphere, they demanded a clear and unbiased preaching of the Gospel and the free election of priests and preachers by members of the community. Second, in the economic sphere and where applicable, they demanded that interest, pensions and rent paid to the clergy should be cease when they reached three times the principal sum. The peasants also demanded permission to hunt, fish and cut timber from forests and common land. The articles, which affected constitutional law, ended by demanding that the treaty of 1519, known as the Rachtung, be repealed and the records destroyed. All privileges of the clergy, even if they were granted by emperors, kings and popes should be declared void. The clergy should now be charged and pay for pasture, guarding (Wacht), direct taxes (Schatzung) excise tax (Ungeld) and Kaufhausgeld. Although there was no direct contact between the citizens and peasants in April and May 1525, because the Council had forbidden that, both sides were always informed about each other. In Pfeddersheim the clergy, nobility, and monastery owned over a third of the arable land. However, there appears to be no particular, local reason for the sudden unrest amongst the Pfeddersheim townsfolk. Rather, they seem to have heard about the situation further afield and followed suit. They had no doubt heard of events in southwest Germany, felt a wave of protest growing and were inclined to join the uprising to improve their social and economic situation. Consequently, it was fairly easy for rebellious peasants to take possession of Pfeddersheim. Meanwhile, after the conquest of W√ºrzburg, Elector Louis V of the Palatinate returned with his army as quickly as possible to his territory to bring an end to the uprising there.  Battle  = Troops and weaponry =  Peasants  The peasants were armed with lances, morning stars, and farm implements. In addition, some peasant mobs had captured firearms. However, in comparison with the prince's troops they were poorly equipped because most of the weapons they had were those they had captured or stolen. The prince's troops, of course, were able to be issued with weapons from the armouries.  Elector Louis' troops  The Elector's Landsknechte who, unlike the peasants, had received military training, were also better armed. Their weapons included several kartouwes (siege guns), scharfmetzes, notschlangen, culverins, demi-culverins, and falconets. Elector Louis also had several so-called F√§hnchens, cavalry squadrons each comprising about 150 troopers. = Course of the battle =  First phase  After the Elector's troops had marched on Pfeddersheim, Marschall von Habern and Schenk Eberhard von Erbach had the artillery and infantry deploy on an eminence to the north only a few metres from the town. Shortly thereafter his artillery began to open fire on the town's defences. The rebels replied with their own artillery, though the exchange of fire was indecisive.  Second phase  When the Palatine army failed to overcome the rebels with their artillery, they began to establish observation points in order to ascertain what the peasants might do next. In addition, cannon, which had hitherto played a secondary role in the battle, were set up relatively close around the town. Small mounted F√§hnleins were also formed and posted on some heights southwest of Pfeddersheim in order to observe the peasants.  Third phase  After troops had been deployed both to the north and the southwest and another position established to the west, the encirclement of Pfeddersheim was almost complete. The east was not occupied because, in the view of the commander, it was unnecessary because there was no gate through which the townsfolk to escape. Nonetheless a final disposition outside the circumvallation was made, in which the cook, the food supply wagon, and, later, Elector Louis, were based. The Knechte (infantry) established themselves between this new position and the River Pfrimm. So the various arms of service were all kept separate and not mixed. No fighting took place during this phase.  Fourth phase  Shortly after the last position had been occupied, a small force of peasants poured out of the west gate of the town. The besiegers suspected that they wanted to advance to the cover of the Georgenberg hill and also that they wanted to attack the horsemen to the south and drive them away. However, neither of these assumptions came to anything because, suddenly, another 7,000 men stormed out of the gate and advanced over the western approaches presumably thinking they could easily defeat the cavalry deployed there. They could not defeat the Prince's cavalry, however, because the latter exceeded the strength and fighting power of the peasants, so they fell back to the hill of Wingartberg, from where they fired on the main body of the cavalry with their guns. Because the Prince's troops did not know where the peasants had gone to when they left the hill, they then waited to see what would happen next. When the peasant bands then stormed the main body of the Prince's army pouring down the southern slopes of the hill, Marshal von Habern went to the aid of the field captain (Feldhauptmann) at his request and placed his troops behind the main body. The artillery grouped around them then immediately fired on the attackers. As the peasant force now looked overmatched, they tried to flee to the town. The royal troops sought to prevent their escape behind the town walls and pursued with their squadrons and mounted troops, with the result many farmers failed to reach the safety of the town. A total of 4,000 peasants were cut off and then either stabbed or strangled on the spot. The remaining peasants who were still in front of the town gate, tried to enter the town. Some peasants even tried to escape to Worms. This incident decimated the ranks of the peasants. As it was already night when the last peasants had either been killed or escaped into the town, three F√§hnleins, 1,500 Knechte, and 1,000 horsemen were deployed around the town for the rest of the night. The next morning, guns were situated near the town and began to open fire. After three hours and 262 shells had been fired, the peasants capitulated and the Prince's army had won the battle.  After the battle  = Reasons for the peasants' defeat = Although both armies were, numerically, roughly the same size, the peasants were defeated primarily for two reasons: first, although the peasants were not poorly armed, because they not only had pitchforks, scythes, and flails, but also pikes, guns, and cannons, they were still powerless against the cavalry since they themselves had no cavalry - a decisive disadvantage. Second, the peasants did not have a military leader who could have coordinated the troops and their direction, objectives, and firepower. There were ringleaders amongst the peasants, but they had no influence beyond the boundaries of their home area. At that time, the peasants did not recognize that they would have no chance of success against the Prince without a united approach. = Consequences for the peasants = On 25 June, all peasants who were not Palatinate subjects, had to leave the town unarmed. Approximately 3,000 obeyed the command. Although they had been warned not to attempt to escape, many farmers took the first opportunity to escape for fear of punishment. The escape attempt failed, however, and the soldiers initiated a bloodbath that cost the lives of 800 people. Thirty ringleaders were immediately beheaded; the other peasants were released under strict conditions to their homes. After the massacre, the troops occupied the town. The remaining peasants had to gather on the cemetery. 180 ringleaders were detained in the shared church at Pfeddersheim. The Pfeddersheim townsfolk had to guard them. For each peasant who escaped, they were warned that a citizen had to lose his life. The inhabitants had to hand over all those they had hidden by the next morning. 24 leaders were executed. All the other peasants were allowed to go free for a fee. But the Pfeddersheim townsfolk were severely punished. Four of their leaders were beheaded. Heavy penalties were imposed on the town: they had to pay high levels of duty, hand over all their weapons, and give up their letters of freedom.  Today  memorial Even today a road that runs northwards towards M√∂rstadt - Georg Scheu Stra√üe - is known locally as Bluthohl (\\"blood hollow\\"). The name comes from the accounts that the battle had raged on the nearby fields that were at a higher level and that the blood of the fallen ran down this road into the town.

Whiteley was born with cerebral palsy, but he did not begin competing in disability sporting events until an illness in 2011 resulted in him inquiring about disability sport. In 2013 he won his first major international medal with a bronze medal at the IPC Athletic World Championship in the 200m. Career history Whiteley was born in England in 1989. Although born with cerebral palsy, when he initially became interested in sports, he competed as an able bodied athlete. His introduction to athletics occurred in his first year of secondary school, while competing at cross country running. He was spotted by the Sale Harriers sporting club and began training with the club. Initially training at long distance events, his coaches brought him down to mid-distance races. In 2011 Whitley fell gravely ill and was told by doctors he would not walk again, though he made a swift recovery. In January 2012 he enquired about disability sport and was nationally classified as a T35 athlete in July 2012 allowing him to compete at the Birmingham Games. In March 2013 he travelled to Dubai where he entered the Fazaa International competition running in both the 100m and 200m T35 sprints. His winning times of 11.60s (100m) and 24.79 (200m) were announced as new world records. Whiteley's first major international event was the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, where he competed as a member of the Great Britain team. Now re-classified by the international board as a T38 athlete, he entered both the 100m and 200m sprints. Whiteley stated that he was mainly there for the experience of attending a major competition and did not expect to medal. He qualified through the semifinals of the 100m in first place, posting a personal best time of 11.31 seconds. In the final he ran 11.33 to finish just outside the medals in fourth place. In the 200m he qualified through the semifinals in second place behind Australia's Evan O'Hanlon in a time of 23.20, an area record. He surpassed that time in the finals, running 23.00 to finish in third place and collected his first international medal.

Folk tales Folktales were told by Raconteurs, who could tell tales lasting several hours, or even tell a story over the course of several evenings. Christian beliefs and superstitions are present in most Quebec folklore. La chasse-galerie (the flying canoe) is a well-known folktale about a group of lumberjacks who make a pact with the devil. Demons, witches, and werewolves were common folk motifs. The tales themselves were referred to by the name contes. The traditional conte form of story-telling has been adapted to the modern novel by writers such as Roch Carrier and Joseph Jean Jacques Ferron. Some folktales are classified under the traditional genre M√§rchen (fairy tales). The Devil at the Dance is an example in which the Devil was used to reinforce Christian ideals. It is the story of a young couple in love. The girl's parents, who are Heretics, refuse the young man as a suitor after discovering he is Christian. When the daughter protests, her mother announces that she would rather have the Devil himself courting her daughter than the young Christian. The following Sunday afternoon, a stranger comes to call: the Devil himself. The three of them- mother, father and daughter-are converted by a priest, and the young couple are then married. There are various versions of this tale: One paints the young girl as being very disobedient and flirtatious. Although her parents warn her of the evils of selfishness, her actions do not change. Thus, the Devil was able to enter her home because of her Unchristian behavior. She is saved once again by the Priest, and converts to Christianity. Another version has the tale happening in a remote village in New Brunswick, but with the same basic storyline. Clearly, the tale evolved depending on what message the storyteller was trying to portray. Regardless of the version, the vast influence of the Catholic Church is clearly noticeable. =Lumberjack heroes= A number of lumberjack heroes were made famous through stories told by itinerant lumberjacks throughout Central Canada and the northern United States. These lumberjack heroes were of French-Canadian origin, and became the basis for many Paul Bunyan stories. They include tales about Joseph Montferrand (\\"Joe Muffreau\\" or \\"Big Joe Mufferaw\\"), Julius Neville, Louis Cyr, and Napoleon La Rue. Superstitions Other aspects of Quebec folklore include superstitions surrounding objects, events, and dreams. In essence, these stem from the belief in both White Magic and Black Magic, where the former is seen to be beneficial and seeks to bring about positive outcomes, and the latter being essentially malicious, sinister, and all-around evil (sometimes also called witchcraft). Although Christianity had slowly chipped away at most forms of magic, the populace still held on to its various superstitions for generations. Where religion provides Quebec with a societal structure, these beliefs sought to predict the future, to help alleviate fear of the unknown. Listed below are objects along with a brief description of the superstition associated with them. * Age: A woman, regardless of marital status, will experience an important event during the year following her 31st birthday. * Bonhomme sept-heures: This man is said to kidnap children who are out of bed after seven o'clock at night. He hides underneath balconies and, equipped with a mask and a bag in which to dispose the children, enters a home after the clock strikes seven. * Freckles: Having freckles on your arms is a sign of sensuality. * Hairbrush: If a young woman drops her hairbrush, she'll lose her fianc√©. * Needle: ** If you lose your needle, you will also lose your horse. ** If you drop a needle and it sticks itself into the ground, then someone is thinking ill of you. * Stars: Count nine stars nine nights in a row, and the last star will point towards your future husband. Research into Quebec folklore Interest in researching and classifying folklore began during the late 19th century. Marius Barbeau established himself as one of Canada's foremost folklorists during the early 20th century. Luc Lacourci√®re founded the Folklore Archives at Laval University in Quebec City. Laval University offers an academic folklore studies program. The Folklore Studies Association of Canada has also done extensive work related to preserving Quebec folklore. The Association Qu√©b√©coise des Loisirs Folkloriques, based in Montreal, runs a number of programs for the public year-round, as well as publishing literature and recordings of folklore. The Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, the McCord Museum in Montreal, and the Mus√©e Qu√©b√©cois de culture populaire in Trois-Rivi√®res have extensive holdings related to Quebec folklore and folk artifacts.

Dedicated to the socio-economic influence of the whaling industry in the region, the museum was established in the abandoned whaling factory used for many years in the processing of whale blubber into oil. History The abandoned 19th century whale factory at the edge of bay, later converted to municipal aquarium The interior exposition area of the museum, showing platforms and F√°brica da Baleia, actual Museu da Baleia. The two steam-boilers used in the mechanization of the rendering process Two of the four autoclaves used for rendering fat On Faial, the whaling industry evolved rapidly from an incepet activity into an industry that brought wealth and prosperity locally, to the point where there existed two factories. The oldest and first of this type was founded at the end of the 19th century, and continued operating until the 20th century, when a new building was constructed to adapt to the new technologies of the time. The new factory was built between 1941 and operated until 1975. It was an operation that used steam-powered equipment using autoclaves, which permitted a rapid processing of whale and total rendering of the mammals. The factory of Porto Pim began to operate in 1942, during the Second World War, at a time when the exportation of oil was at its peak.GRA/OMA (2013), p.1 The property was owned by SIMAL Sociedade Industrial Mar√≠timia A√ßoriana Lda. (Azorean Industrial Maritime Society) which was constituted in 1939 from 25 partners, that included the Lisboeta Francisco Marcelino dos Reis and the local business Costa & Martins Lda. SIMAL was established to explore the whale oil concession, in addition to other species of marine animals, and commercialize products produce from the rendering of these mammals. The factory was technologically innovative for the time. The proprietors had acquired the majority of the machinery overseas, including the flour-making equipment, which was purchased from the Norwegian company Myrens Verksted. Similarly, the motors that drove the machinery were acquired the German company MotorenFabrik Deutz AG. The factory operated using vapour generated from two large kettles (dating from 1904), approximately and of heating area. This equipment allowed the rendering of 60‚Äì65 tonnes of oil and six tonnes of flour. During the 30 years of operation, the factory in Porto Pim processed 1940 sperm whales and produced enough whale oil to fill 44,000 barrels. In 1974, accompanying the decline of the whaling industry around the world, the factory closed down its operations, following the adherence of the Portuguese government to international obligations in the anti-whaling movement. It was bought by the Regional Government in 1980 and, in 1984, classified as a Property of Public Interest (IIP). In 2000, after public works to restore the buildings, it was inaugurated during the second Expopescas exposition, to operate as the Centro do Mar, in order to operate as a cultural and scientific interpretative centre. Most of the machinery and equipment were completely restored, and represent a precious marker of traditional practices and socio-cultural influences on the culture of the island. Since 2004, the factory museum has been operated by the OMA Observat√≥rio do Mar dos A√ßores (Azores Ocean Observatory).

Though the practice of Freemasonry was suppressed by the reigning Austrian Habsburg dynasty, it enjoyed a revival under Napoleonic rule that persisted after the close of his reign. After their initial founding, Masonic lodges in Luxembourg rapidly developed strong ties with their French and Belgian counterparts. While suppressed again under Nazi rule, postwar Freemasonry forged stronger ties with the Anglo-American extension of the brotherhood, though the oldest lodges still use the French form of Masonic ritual.  Origins  Freemasonry first appeared in Luxembourg in the 18th century. It was also the provincial Grand Lodge of the Austrian Netherlands which established the first permanent Lodge in 1770. This was a semi-military, semi-civilian Lodge, with the title \\"The Perfect Union\\", where garrison members and local notables encountered each other.Geisen, Paul. \\"La franc-ma√ßonnerie luxembourgeoise: Aper√ßu historique et sp√©cificit√©s\\". In: forum, No. 272 (December 2007). p. 28-31 The Freemasonry was later suppressed by Austrian Emperor Joseph II, and the Lodge disappeared. However, Freemasonry was to reappear under similar conditions when Luxembourg was annexed in the French Revolutionary Wars, becoming the D√©partement des For√™ts, home to military Lodges of the French regiments. It was the Grand Orient of France which in 1803 granted a charter to the new civilian Lodge, under the title of \\"The Children of Fortified Concord\\".  Napoleon's defeat  Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna saw Luxembourg (after this ruled by the King of the Netherlands) lose territory to Prussia. These events destroyed the Masonic ties between the Grand Orient of France and the Lodge of the \\"Children of fortified Concord\\", who now passed under the Grand Lodge of the Southern provinces of the Netherlands. However, in the same way that many of the French innovations were left in place (e.g. administrative reforms, the Code Civil), so too the Lodge in Luxembourg continued to work according to the French Rite and in the French language. Luxembourg Freemasons in fact managed to acquire a certain level of autonomy, since the Dutch occupiers tended not to participate in Luxembourg Masonic life. This autonomy was reinforced in 1818 when they acquired the \\"H√¥tel de la Loge\\" as their own premises.  Independence and internationalism  After 1839, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg became an independent state, after ceding its western, French-speaking territories, which became part of Belgium. The Lodge of the Children of fortified Concord left what had now become the Grand Orient of Belgium, and in 1844 constituted itself as a central Lodge. Despite the reduction in the country's territory, and the rupture of its previous institutional ties, Luxembourgish masonry maintained a high degree of openness to other countries. This is due in part to the country's small size, immigration in the late 19th century, and a tradition of the cohabitation of different cultural and linguistic groups in one geographic area. This can be attributed to the fact that Luxembourgish Freemasons maintained close ties to their French and Belgian brothers. This was partly because only one chapter existed in Luxembourg, so that those seeking to advance to the higher degrees of Freemasonry, had to do so in France or Belgium. Additionally, from 1815 to 1867, when the country was declared neutral, the capital city was a fortress of the German Confederation, and therefore hosted a large Prussian garrison. This entailed the presence of the military Lodge \\"Bl√ºcher von Wahlstatt\\", attached to the \\"Gro√üe Nationale Mutterloge zu den drei Weltkugeln\\" in Berlin. The Lodge of the Children of fortified Concord agreed to share premises with this German-speaking Lodge. This cohabitation involved both Lodges preserving their independence, their rites and their own language, but also entailed an agreement not to compete for the recruitment of members, coordinating charitable works and mutually organised events. The fraternal ties with the Bl√ºcher von Wahlstatt Lodge have been maintained to this day, even after its departure for Berlin in 1867. At the time, these ties were, for Luxembourgish Freemasonry, a sort of counter-weight to the influence of francophone Latin Masonry. The experience of this symbiosis of Gallic and Germanic influences showed its purpose when ties were broken off between German and French Freemasons after 1870 in a time of political tensions; Luxembourgish Masons assumed the role of a mediator between the two Freemasonries. Thus, Luxembourgish Masons set about organising meetings between their German and French brothers, whilst engaging in a multilateral effort with Masons from Switzerland, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The same internationalist approach was upheld during World War I and the interwar period, when Luxembourgish Freemasons created two organisations to bring aid to war victims. While it developed international relations focused on continental Europe, Luxembourgish Freemasons organised themselves into a Grand Lodge in 1926, while also suffering attacks from Catholic ultramontanists and the influence of positivism, and therefore became more secularised and more politicised, similarly to the Grand Orients of Belgium and France.  Post- World War II  After suppression under Nazi rule, Luxembourgish Freemasons revived their traditions anew. Previously severed ties with English Freemasonry were restored after years of conflict between English and Luxembourgish Masons, which fostered a newfound sense of international unity within the order. This normalisation process was carried out by a council of several Grand Lodges throughout Europe, including participants from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and, briefly, France. This was inspired in part by the desire to return Luxembourgish Freemasonry to its symbolic and spiritualistic aspects, after these had been neglected due to the high concentration of British troops in continental Europe during the 1950s. Luxembourgish Freemasonry actively and broadly supported the revitalisation of the order with the reintroduction of the Grand Architect of the Universe symbol and the Bible as a source of sacred law in 1953, and the ratification of the Convention of Luxembourg in 1954. This reorientation however came at the price of severed ties with the Masons of France and Belgium who were now regarded as heretical. By 1969 the international relations of Luxembourgish Freemasonry developed to the point that the Grand Lodge of Luxembourg was recognised by the United Grand Lodge of England. The Grand Lodge consisted of approximately 300 members with the number of Lodges growing from one to three in the post-war period, and then adding a fourth and fifth Lodge in 1974 and 1997 respectively. The three oldest Lodges, \\"The Children of the Fortified Concord\\", the \\"Perfect Union\\", and \\"St. John of Hope\\", use the French language and a ritual descended from the French Rite. This, however, has been strongly influenced by the Scottish Rite, and a series of local adaptations. The English-speaking Lodge \\"Friendship\\" was founded in 1974. Finally, the German- speaking Lodge \\"Zur Bruderkette\\" uses the rite of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Germany.

Career Sternburg first worked at NET, the national educational television service where, in 1969, she produced a feature-length documentary, El Teatro Campesino, on the Chicano theatre troupe that had performed in the agricultural fields of central California in support of the farm workers strike led by Cesar Chavez. The film was broadcast on public television. In the early 1970s Sternburg turned her attention to the confluence of women and creativity, a shift in direction that influenced the rest of her professional life. She conceived, commissioned and edited a compendium of contemporary and diverse female voices, The Writer On Her Work (1980). A sequel to The Writer On Her Work, subtitled New Essays In New Territories, was published in 1991. For this second volume Sternburg commissioned essays from women around the world. Poets & Writers magazine devoted a cover story to both books, calling them ‚Äúlandmarks.‚Äù The second book was selected for 500 Great Books by Women. Interest in Virginia Woolf‚Äôs novels and essays led Sternburg to produce, co-direct and write the short film, Virginia Woolf: The Moment Whole, featuring Marian Seldes as Woolf. In an interview Sternburg said, ‚ÄúWoolf‚Äôs work has a powerful sense of experience in the world. I felt that the person who had written her novels could not have been the ethereal creature that many people have imagined.‚Äù The Woolf film was broadcast on public television. Through the 1970s and 80s, Sternburg continued to publish essays and poems. She served as director of Writers in Performance at the Manhattan Theatre Club from 1971-80. In an article about the series, journalist David Kaufman wrote, ‚ÄùSternburg‚Äôs background as a writer, a filmmaker, and director of films for public television, lent a unique blend of administrative and programming expertise with literary and creative insights‚Äìa mixture that would shape the series‚Äô future and mold it into the important force it has become.‚Äù In 1980 she became Senior Program Officer at the New York Council for the Humanities, co-editing a book, Historians and Filmmakers: Toward Collaboration, intended to break barriers between artists and scholars. From 1988-1994 Sternburg served as Senior Program Advisor to The Rockefeller Foundation, fostering intercultural film and video projects and co-curating the exhibition \\"Re-Mapping Cultures\\" at the Whitney Museum with John G. Hanhardt. In 1988, Sternburg married Steven D. Lavine who had recently been appointed president of California Institute of the Arts. In January 1994, the Northridge earthquake severely damaged the CalArts campus. For Sternburg, the experience served as a profound object lesson in the fragility of all things, leading her to write the book Phantom Limb: A Meditation on Memory. The book has been described as ‚Äúpart moving account of greater love in the face of her mother‚Äôs death, part medical inquiry into neurology, and part spiritual meditation on the struggles and sufferings that living visits on each of us.‚Äù Her most recent book, White Matter: A Memoir of Family and Medicine (September, 2015) is the second in a projected trilogy.http://blog.calarts.edu/2015/09/14/janet-sternburgs-white-matter- examines-medical-and-family-legacies/ A story of family secrets and mental illness, White Matter spans one hundred years and the lives of five sisters and one brother, interwoven with science and history.http://hawthornebooks.com/catalogue/white-matter, White Matter was chosen for a Publishers Weekly \\"Big Indie Book of the Fall.\\" http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult- announcements/article/67871-the-big-indie-books-of-fall.html Forbes Magazine suggested that in writing White Matter ‚ÄúSternburg uses all the skills at her disposal, the sensitivity, precision and lyricism of a poet, the hard edges of a photographer, the intelligence and scholarship of an academic, to plumb the many facets of this story and its legacy on her and her family.\\" https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomteicholz/2015/09/21/book-review-white-matter- a-memoir-of-family-and-medicine-by-janet-sternburg/#1eb019957c74 Photography In 1998, Sternburg began making photographs with disposable cameras, using their technical limitations to see ‚Äúthe layers of time and space that are present in a single moment.‚Äù Her photographs have been exhibited in solo shows in New York, Los Angeles, Korea, Mexico, Berlin, Freiburg, Heidelberg and Munich, and are in the collection of The Fisher Museum at the University of Southern California. Portfolios of her photographs have been published in Aperture magazine and Art Journal. In his essay, ‚ÄúThe Lyrical View,‚Äù German cultural critic Joern Jacob Rohwer writes: ‚Äú[Sternburg‚Äôs] vision captivates audiences with intellectual and emotional depth, precision of observation, and an unmistakable sense of the moment.‚Äù Her continuing exploration of the relationships between word and image led to the publication of Optic Nerve: Photopoems. In this book, she combined poems with photographs ‚Äúwhich do not act as an adjunct to the poem, but in a subtle way complement and finish each piece.‚Äù. In 2017, a monograph of her photographic work, Overspilling World: The Photographs of Janet Sternburg was published by DIstanz Verlag with a Foreword by Wim Wenders who writes: ‚ÄúPhotographers don‚Äôt have eyes in the back of their head. Janet Sternburg does.

Since 1974, she has been awarded residencies at The MacDowell Colony, The Millay Colony, Blue Mountain Artist Residency, and the Djerassi Resident Artists Program. She has received grants from the American Embassy in Germany and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Philosophical work =Overview of books= Longuenesse has written three books, edited two volumes, and published numerous refereed papers. Her books have been described as major contributions to Kantian and Hegelian scholarship. Her first book, Kant and the Capacity to Judge. Sensibility and Discursivity in the Transcendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason, focused on Kant's \\"Table of Judgements,\\" arguing that it in fact formed the backbone of the rest of Kant's work. Her second book, Kant on the Human Standpoint, began by attempting to rebut some of the critiques of her first book, and went on to analyze other aspects of Kant's work, including his views on freedom, reason, and causality. Her third book, Hegel's Critique of Metaphysics, starts by providing a close reading of some of Hegel's works that have traditionally been considered difficult to analyze, and goes on to make an argument that Hegel's work represents a novel reworking of Kant's ideas, and that the Hegelian corpus could be used as a base upon which to build a plausible alternative to Lockean empiricism. The volume Longuenesse edited, Kant and the Early Moderns, was a collection of essays focusing on how Kant understood the work of philosophers that came before him, and how that shaped his own work. *Hegel et la Critique de la m√©taphysique (Vrin, 1981). Appears in English as Hegel's Critique of Metaphysics (Cambridge University Press, 2007), with two new chapters and a new preface. *Kant at le Pouvoir de juger.

Sensibility and Discursivity in the Transcendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason (Princeton University Press, 2000). *Kant on the Human Standpoint (Cambridge University Press, 2005). = Kant's critical philosophy = Longuenesse is well known for her work on Kant's theory of judgment, which, she argues, provides the crucial backbone for central arguments in Kant's critical system.

Longuenesse's responses to the discussions elicited by her book have appeared in numerous articles, some of which were included in her second Kant book, Kant on the Human Standpoint (2005). hardback; 2nd edition . This book expands her interpretation of Kant's theory of judgment to consideration of its role in Kant's philosophy of nature, moral philosophy and aesthetic theory. = Hegel's Science of Logic = Before beginning her systematic work on Kant, Longuenesse wrote and published on Hegel. In Hegel et la Critique de la M√©taphysique,Hegel et la Critique de la M√©taphysique, Paris : Librairie Philosophique Vrin, 1981 Revised English version, Hegel's Critique of Metaphysics, Cambridge University Press 2007, . she argued that Hegel's Science of Logic should be read as a radicalization of Kant's transcendental logic. For Hegel just as for Kant, the categories of traditional metaphysics are universal forms of thinking rather than representations of intrinsic properties of things supposed to be independent of the activity of thinking. Contra Kant, however, Hegel argues that this characterization of the categories of metaphysics does not entail that we have no knowledge of things as they are in themselves. In more recent articles, some of which are gathered in the English version of her Hegel book, Longuenesse further explores the differences between Hegel's and Kant's respective views of the nature of concepts, judgments, and inferences. She lays out the consequences of those views for an assessment of the possibility and limits of metaphysics. = Philosophy of mind and self-consciousness = Longuenesse's recent work has expanded beyond the history of modern philosophy into contemporary philosophy of mind and language, in connection with psychology and neuroscience. Her work focuses on the nature of self- consciousness and its relation to the use of the first person pronoun in language and in thought. She argues that our uses of 'I' depend on two fundamental kinds of self-consciousness: consciousness of oneself as engaged in a mental activity apt to generate and assess reasons for our beliefs and actions; and consciousness of oneself as an embodied entity. An important aspect of Kant's legacy, she claims, is to have clearly distinguished these two kinds of self-consciousness and taken the first to be fundamental to any use of 'I'. She draws on resources from both the \\"analytic\\" and the \\"continental\\" traditions of philosophy to offer an original contribution to contemporary debates on self-consciousness. Her work in this area has appeared in interdisciplinary venues alongside that of linguists, philosophers of language,Simon Prosser and Fran√ßois Recanati (eds.), Immunity to Error through Misidentification: New Essays, Cambridge University Press, 2012, .

The roots of CBTraining lie in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and like CBT the basic premise of CBTraining is that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. However, CBTraining is delivered in a highly structured, regimented format and combines several other behavioral change theories and methodologies in addition to CBT. Cognitive behavioral training is currently used primarily in the behavioral health industry and in criminal psychology. Difference from CBT Although CBTraining employs some similar foundation concepts that define Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, there are some fundamental differences between CBTraining and CBT, both in philosophy and in application. CBTraining is training, not therapy. This is a critical distinction: unlike typical forms and applications of CBT, CBTraining is a process that is absolutely finite. That is to say, when a person begins taking a structured cognitive behavioral training course or program, there is already in place a set schedule ‚Äì and therefore an end date ‚Äì to the training. Among one other main difference is the goal for a change. In CBT, as with most therapy, the patient plays a large role in determining the direction of the therapy, including the intensity and duration. An CBTraining course, or program, is usually broken up into a series of progressive, strategically ordered sessions ‚Äì each one with a particular focus. CBTraining unfolds step by step, guiding the participant through the process of retraining the brain away from the emotionally dependent thinking. Participants of CBTraining take \\"classes,\\" are quizzed, and are given \\"homework\\". Much of the homework in CBTraining is based on writing therapy; as people write their emotional experience, their sense of trauma and stress is diminished and better understood. CBTraining is not individualized, but it is designed to the specific trauma or stress an individual may feel. Cognitive behavioral training aims to create rapid change in the \\"students.\\" The \\"students\\" are placed in group or classes, and is governed by a prearranged pathway to change. Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training has been used to teach and firmly implant social behavioral change in children. Here is a concise explanation of a main difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral skills training: \\"...cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on how beliefs affect mood...skills training focuses on practicing pragmatic skills of living...\\"Granholm, Eric PhD. \\"Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training\\" CBTraining aims for fast and effect new skills that the individual can being to use in their own life. Description Cognitive behavioral training (CBTraining) is a cognitive-based process designed with the aim to systematically break down emotionally driven dependencies and behaviors, replacing them with behaviors that are based on rational choice. Like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the philosophy of CBTraining is rooted to one essential notion: feeling and thought are linked. CBTraining contends that in any emotionally dependent relationship, people make emotional decisions rather than rational choices. When an emotionally dependent relationship occurs, it creates a belief-induced emotional state. When someone is in this state, they are incapable of making rational choices for more than a short period of time due to an emotion-driven process that overrides their conscious mind. This phenomenon explains why an over eater cannot resist having another bite... and another... and another, despite the fact that they are not physically hungry and they know that overeating is unhealthy. CBTraining was born out of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and utilizes well established theories of psychology and treatment, including: bibliotherapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, behavioral self-control theory, behavioral economic theory, self-determination theory, and motivational interviewing. Each of these methods plays a role in CBTraining, at varying stages of completion, in the common endeavor to bring a new sense of cognizant awareness in the participant. Cognitive Behavioral Training, applied in a structured way (CBTraining), has also been used to deal effectively with women dealing with the stressors of having breast cancer (e.g., changing thoughts about stressors ) in studies done at the University of Miami.Science Daily: Gallagher, Annette \\"Cognitive behavioral or relaxation training helps women reduce distress during breast cancer treatment\\" Willpower In addressing addictive behavior and other potentially destructive behavior compelling to the participant, CBTraining uses an approach of urge conditioning/desensitization. This approach stands in contrast to what is commonly most instinctive to people (urge avoidance), and seems counter-intuitive at first. The approach of urge desensitization has been applied to patients with gambling addictions, and research has shown it to be effective.Department of Psychiatry: Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Gyeonggi South Korea; Han C. Kim D. \\"Desensitization of Triggers and Urge Reproducing for Pathological Gambling: A Case Series\\" When a person is trying to quit smoking, for instance, the instinct is to remove all smoking paraphernalia from his presence. While this \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" approach seems to make sense, it does nothing to actually deal with the emotionally driven urge to smoke. CBTraining contends that, in fact, this white-knuckled method of willpower only lends the urge more power. With urge conditioning/desensitization, the participant is asked to actually create urges in order to become comfortable with having them. As the strategic format of CBTraining unfolds through the training, the urges are methodically stripped of their power. In acknowledging \\"urge\\", says CBTraining, you are actually acknowledging your power to choose. Further distinguishing CBTraining from its closely related psychological predecessors is the inclusion of the concept of \\"Training\\" in place of \\"Therapy\\". CBTraining is a planned, intricately designed and systematically applied regimen that is purposely finite. CBTraining begins with a specific goal, and is constructed as a time- specific road map to achieving the goal. As a person undergoes the training, CBTraining aims to change not only this person's self-talk but his/her self- image at a subconscious level, so that the change in behavior is intrinsically motivated and willpower never really plays a part in it. History of development Along with CBT, CBTraining also owes some debt to Albert Ellis's rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), formerly known as Rational Emotive Therapy. REBT is classified as a form of CBT, and is anchored by the belief that a person is \\"affected emotionally by his/her perspective and attitude about outside things.\\" As with CBTraining, REBT incorporates Positive Self- Image Psychology. Lou Ryan, a pioneer in the creation, development, and practical application of CBTraining, worked for some time under the guidance of Albert Ellis. In the early 1980s, Ryan, who was well-versed in Ellis's theories and philosophies, met Ellis in Hawaii after a series of seminars. Ellis recognized his own impact in Ryan's CBTraining programs, and played a peripheral part in some of the development. According to Ryan when asked about the evolutional process of his particular philosophy: \\"I had collected a potpourri of different types of approaches, programs, and philosophies that I had come across through the years. To me, what seemed to be missing was vision. Vision for what people want from life is motivating but can often be lost in the daily trudge of life.\\" About his time with Ellis, Ryan said: \\"I had met him at a conference in Hawaii. We met afterwards, and I told him what I was doing, that there were similarities between what we were doing. I asked him if he would review what I had put together, and for his input... he coached me on a few things. It occurred to me to add a structure to all of these philosophies.\\"Live interview with Lou Ryan, San Diego CA, February 2014 Also involved in some of the early development of SCBT were John E. MartinMartin, Dr. John E and Scott T. Waters.Walters, Dr. Scott T In a written critical evaluation of SCBT, Dr. Martin and Dr. Waters stated that, \\"The greatest strength [of SCBT] is the strategic and effective use of techniques that exclusively target people who are ready to change now.\\" They went on to say, in the same report, \\"...the rigidity of language and pacing might result in negative feelings towards a Training that gives so little choice itself.\\"Martin, John E. PhD; Walters, Scott T. PhD.\\"Evaluation of SelfHelpWorks Lifestyle Intervention Site: A Three Tiered Critical Analysis\\" August, 2003 Specific applications CBT has been used most notably in two different spectrums: health and wellness, and criminal psychology (with the intention to minimize recidivism). =Health and wellness= CBTraining has been established to some degree in changing emotionally addictive behaviors related to tobacco.John Martin, Ph.D;David M. Young \\"Comparison of American Cancer Society versus Internet Based treatment for Smokers\\" February 2003 San Diego State University Graduate ResearchMichael Wooley, M.D.;John Whitlock, Ph.D \\"Case Study #1 St. Lukes Hospital and Medical Center\\" San Antonio TX, February 2001 There is evidence that cognitive group behavioral training may be beneficial for patients with type 1 diabetes in their self-care.Diabetes Research Group \\"Cognitive Behavioral Group Training for Patients with Type 1 Diabetes\\" March 2005 SCBT has been used to help people with diabetes manage their disease, with the primary goal being maintained lifestyle changes to slow or halt the progression of the disease. San Diego based SelfHelpWorks Inc.\\"SelfHelpWorks\\" has incorporated SCBT as a core component of its behavioral training courses for smoking cessation, alcohol management, weight management, diabetes management, and stress management. Case studies\\"Case Study: 390 Corporate Employees\\"\\"Health Risk Assessment (HRA) Comparison\\" within the American workplace indicate the efficacy of CBTraining, however as of yet academic studies in this promising area are still relatively sparse. Cognitive Behavioral Training has been used, combined with diet and exercise to reduce body weight and raise physical capacity in health care workers.Christensen, J.R.; Faber, Anne; Ekner, Dorte; Overgaard, Kristian; Holtermann, Andreas; Sogaard, Karen \\"Diet, physical exercise and cognitive behavioral training as a combined workplace based intervention to reduce body weight and increase physical capacity in health care workers - a randomized controlled trial.\\" It has also shown some promise in reducing pain receptor reactions in the brain after a painful stimulus. =Addiction= CBTraining has been heavily documented in its efficacy with addiction-related issues that involve substances such as food, alcohol and tobacco. Since the philosophy of CBTraining is that feeling is related to thought, and thought can lead to belief, it assumes that addiction in itself is at least partially dependent on the continued dysfunctional and oft-practiced thoughts and beliefs of the addict. Much of CBTraining is the encouragement to expand your \\"comfort zone\\" until the discomfort of physical withdrawal is no longer bothersome. For instance, when seasoned smokers decide to quit on their own, they typically consider it a matter of willpower, following the natural instinct to avoid cigarettes and \\"white knuckle\\" it. By contrast, CBTraining focuses on the cognitive aspects. It systematically applies a combination of techniques that makes the smoker consciously aware of the urge to smoke, explains the emotionally charged thought process that is really causing the urges, and brings the smoker to the point of purposefully creating urges while choosing the benefits of not smoking over the consequences of smoking in a way that no longer causes discomfort. =Stress and anxiety= SCBT contends that high levels of stress and anxiety are the practiced, subconscious choice of the mind. If stress is a feeling related to thought, and if thinking thoughts that produce stress is an unconscious habit, then this unconscious habit must first be made conscious to the patient. Once this is accomplished, the power to change thought, and hence feeling, is feasible. In a nine-week \\"brief structured cognitive behavioral intervention\\" designed for family caregivers for persons diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, there was a reduction in stress and anxiety ‚Äì \\"Moreover, these reductions in anxiety were maintained through a six-week follow-up period...\\"Rhonda L. Akkerman, Phd. \\"Brief Structured Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\\" = PTSD = To reduce the avoidance and maladaptive associations with trauma, therapists using CBT to treat PTSD use reminders of the trauma or emotions that occurred alongside the trauma. =Disease management= SCBT has been used in helping diabetics manage their disease. Since diabetes is a disease that needs to be managed to a large degree by the patient himself/herself, much is dependent on the patient's lifestyle. In addition to producing a shift in mindset from living like a victim to living normally, SCBT has been used to help change pre-existing aversions to healthy living that are known to exacerbate the diabetic condition or, in the case of type 2 diabetes, may even have brought it on in the first place. In all areas CBTraining is applied to, there is maintained a key concept that when one is constantly aware of the power to choose, one will not be vulnerable to feelings of deprivation. =In adolescents with behavior disorders= A training program was developed and applied with the specific aim to increase self-control and reduce aggression in young people.Etscheidt, S. \\"Reducing Aggressive Behavior and Improving Self-Control: A Cognitive- Behavioral Training Program for Behaviorally Disordered Adolescents.\\" Students were divided into six classes, with five students comprising each class. There was also a study regarding the effectiveness of CBTraining in hyperactive boys in anger-inducing situations Hinshaw, S.P.; Henker, B; Whalen, C.K. \\"Self- control in hyperactive boys in anger-inducing situations: Effects of cognitive-behavioral training and of methylphenidate\\" Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology March 1984, Volume 12, Issue 1, pp 55‚Äì77 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00913461 =Criminal behavior= Cognitive-behavioral programs developed for criminal offenders tend to focus on either cognitive deficits or cognitive distortions. Numerous studies have been conducted in correctional settings testing the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral techniques at reducing recidivism. Highly individualized one-on-one cognitive-behavioral therapy, provided by clinical psychologists or other mental health workers, is simply not practical on a large scale within our prison system. Therefore cognitive-behavioral therapies in correctional settings consist of highly structured treatments that are typically delivered to groups of 8 to 12 individuals in classroom-like settings.Wilson, David B.; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Mackenzie, Doris L. \\"A Quantitative Review of Structured, Group-Oriented, Cognitive-Behavioral Programs for Offenders\\" Criminal Justice and Behavior April 2005 vol. 32 no. 2 172-204 http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short) Methods of access =In group/in person= In the use of structured cognitive programs for convicted criminals to reduce recidivism, the method was in person, and in group form.Wilson, David B.; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Mackenzie, Doris L. \\"A Quantitative Review of Structured, Group-Oriented, Cognitive-Behavioral Programs for Offenders\\" Criminal Justice and Behavior April 2005 vol. 32 no. 2 172-204) http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short) There is no evidence that, when targeting this particular issue, SCBT has been used in any other format to date. Criticisms Although studies have been limited, initial data indicates that success with SCBT is largely dependent on the active, cooperative participation of the patient. The number one factor in inefficacy is failure to complete the training. This essentially means that CBTraining, as it is presented in internet form, is geared towards participants who, in relation to the stages-of-change theory, are in the preparation and action stages.Gold, Mark S. MD \\"Stages of Change\\" Psyche Central In other words, CBTraining will be most effective when applied to people with a high motivation to change. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is an indicator of limitations. Simply put, SCBT is not likely to be effective treatment in someone who has no intention to change.

It premiered on USA Network on July 17, 2014. On October 2, 2014, USA Network cancelled Rush. Plot The series is the story of a hard-partying Los Angeles doctor serving a very specific clientele, the kind with a lot of cash and a lot of secrets. After Dr. William Rush was dismissed from a major L.A. hospital, he entered \\"concierge\\" medicine, making personal visits to the homes and workplaces of wealthy clients and Hollywood celebrities who need his care, often with no questions asked. Rush demands payment in cash, often thousands of dollars, and in advance. But some of that money is used to feed his drug habit, and one of the characters in the show, Manny Maquis, is his drug supplier. Dr. Alex Burke is his best friend who, unlike Rush, is still practicing at a major hospital and trying to be a faithful husband and dad. Eve Parker is Rush's personal assistant who not only sets Rush's medical appointments with patients, but also tries to keep him on track, despite her knowledge of his drug and alcohol use.

Biography =Early life= Raphael J. Moses was born in 1812 to a prominent Jewish-American family in Charleston, South Carolina.Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities - Columbus, Georgia, Institute of Southern Jewish LifeLewis Regenstein, Raphael Moses (1812-1893), New Georgia Encyclopedia, 12/16/2004UNC University Libraries: Collection Title: Raphael Jacob Moses Autobiography, 1892Columbus State University: Raphael J. Moses Collection (MC 57) His family fought in the American Revolutionary War of 1775-1783, and he was a fifth-generation South Carolinian. His father was Israel Moses and his mother, Deborah Cohen. He grew up in Charleston. =Career= He practiced as a lawyer in St. Joseph, Florida and Apalachicola, Florida, settling down in Columbus, Georgia in 1848. He purchased The Esquiline, a plantation named after Esquiline Hill in Rome, Italy and located in what is now known as the neighborhood of Benning Hills in Columbus, Georgia. He owned fifty slaves in 1850 and sixty slaves by 1860. He pioneered the commercial growing of peaches on his plantation, becoming of the first merchants to ship them to the North (New York City) in 1851. He shipped his peaches in champagne baskets instead of shipping them in containers of pulverized charcoal, the standard method at that time. The end result was a fresher peach, which proved very popular with consumers. In the late 1850s, he became an outspoken proponent of secession. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he served as the chief commissary officer for Generals Robert Toombs and James Longstreet in the Confederate States Army (CSA). As such, he was responsible for providing food and supplies to 54,000 Confederate troops and personnel. He was also a confidant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, especially during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1‚Äì3, 1863. On May 5, 1865, he attended the last meeting of the Confederate States of America government at the Bank of the State of Georgia (later the Heard House) and carried out its last order. It was then that Confederate Jefferson Davis instructed him to take US$40,000 in gold and silver bullions from the Confederate Treasury to feed and clothe the defeated Confederate soldiers. His three sons served in the CSA as well. After the war, he returned to law practice in Columbus, Georgia. He was, however, greatly impoverished by the Confederate defeat, as his wealth plummeted from $55,000 in 1860 to $35,000 in 1870. Moreover, fifty- nine of his sixty slaves left his plantation. He had a dispute with William Hugh Young and lobbied against Eagle & Phenix, Young's business vehicle. Additionally, he became an outspoken critic of the Republican-led Reconstruction efforts in Georgia and the South. He was later elected to the Georgia House of Representatives and served as Chair of the Judiciary Committee. Shortly after he was elected, he declared, \\"I wanted to go to congress as a Jew and because I‚Ä¶would have liked in a public position to confront and do my part towards breaking down the prejudice.\\" He added, \\"I feel it an honor to be of a race whom persecution can not crush, whom prejudice has in vain endeavored to subdue.\\" In 1892, he wrote his autobiography. =Personal life= He married Eliza Matilda Moses (1812-1892), the daughter of Isaac Clifton Moses (1781-1834) and Hannah Lazarus Moses (1783-1835).

It was defeated in the Senate on April 17, 2013 by a vote of 40 to 60. Background Efforts to create a new federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB 1994) were renewed on December 14, 2012, when 20 children and six adults were shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. At the time, it was the deadliest shooting to occur at a primary or secondary school, the second- deadliest mass shooting by a single person, and one of the 25 deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Within hours of the shooting, a We the People user started a petition asking the White House to \\"immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress.\\" That afternoon, President Barack Obama made a televised statement offering condolences on behalf of the nation to Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy and saying, \\"we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.\\" Speaking at a December 16 memorial service in Newtown, Obama said he would \\"use whatever power this office holds\\" to prevent similar tragedies. By December 17, the White House petition had more than 150,000 signatures, and one week after the shooting it had almost 200,000, along with those on 30 similar petitions. On December 21, 2012, Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown. He said, \\"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\\" and that debating legislation that won't work would be a waste of time. Feinstein and Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, held a separate news conference in response to LaPierre's. There, Feinstein said that the bill was a work in progress and that one idea was to register grandfathered assault weapons under the National Firearms Act (NFA) and another was a buy-back program. A December 26, two-page bill summary on the senator's web site also mentioned registering grandfathered assault weapons under the NFA, but not a buy-back program. (Neither proposal appeared in the text of the bill introduced to the Senate.) On January 16, 2013, Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence in four parts, one of which was banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The plan included 23 executive orders, signed immediately by the president, and 12 proposals for Congress, including reinstating and strengthening the ban on assault weapons that was in place from 1994 to 2004, and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. The proposals were opposed by the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), and opposition was expected by legislators of both parties. Introduction of the bill, and debate On January 24, 2013, Dianne Feinstein and 24 Democratic cosponsors introduced , the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, into the U.S. Senate. The bill was similar to the 1994 federal ban, but differed in that it used a one-feature test for a firearm to qualify as an assault weapon rather than the two-feature test of the 1994 ban. Such a move would deter the average gun owner from wanting to purchase a neutered rifle. In addition, it banned: the sale, transfer, importation or manufacture of about 150 named firearms; firearms with thumbhole stocks and bullet buttons; the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines; and high- capacity ammunition magazines (defined as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds). It would grandfather in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempt more than 2,000 specific firearms \\"used for hunting or sporting purposes.\\" On March 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill, though it was expected not to clear the full Senate. (Had the bill passed in the Senate, it was not expected to pass in the House of Representatives.) =Advocacy= The NRA's reaction to the proposed bill was swift. Its Institute for Legislative Action division started a \\"Stop The Gun Ban\\" campaign before the legislation was introduced in the Senate, asking its members to call their representatives and urge them to oppose the ban. Gun Owners of America (GOA) asked its members to do the same. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence issued a press release in support of the bill. =Public opinion= A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted days after the shooting showed that public support for strengthening gun laws rose 15 percent compared to a similar poll in 2011. A law banning assault weapons was opposed by 51 percent of Americans, but one banning high-capacity magazines (defined by the poll as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds) was supported by 62 percent of Americans. Defeat of the bill, and after In March 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to leave the proposed ban out of the broader gun control bill, saying that it was unlikely to win 40 votes in the 100-member chamber and that it would jeopardize more widely supported proposals. On the morning of April 17, 2013, Feinstein displayed on the Senate floor a blow-up of a New York Daily News front page with photos of the 20 dead Sandy Hook Elementary School children and the headline, \\"Shame on U.S.\\" Before the vote, she said to her colleagues, \\"Show some guts.\\" However, as expected, S. 150, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, failed on a vote of 40 in favor to 60 in opposition. It was supported by Democrat Reid and Republican Senator Mark Kirk, but 15 Democrats, one independent, and all the Republicans except Kirk voted against the ban. After the vote, Feinstein said that Congress' failure to pass the law would lead a number of states passing their own assault weapons bans. She vowed to keep trying, and said \\"I believe the American people are far ahead of their elected officials on this issue.\\" Criticisms of the bill Critics of the bill said there were over 100 million \\"high- capacity magazines\\" (as defined by the bill) already in circulation in the United States. They also said that very few of these magazines were registered and a ban like this would be ineffective in keeping these magazines out of criminal hands.

It had as its goal the celebration of rural life during a period of rapid industrialization. The clergy and the state encouraged this type of literature; in fact, the moral conservatism of the roman du terroir \\"contrasts starkly\\" with the trends in the literature of France at the time. The Qu√©b√©cois establishment were hoping that support for this type of novel would strengthen Qu√©b√©cois morality, and perhaps halt an exodus of French Qu√©b√©cois from rural farming areas to Montreal and the textile factories of New England.  Values  The moral mission of the romans du terroir was set out by Abb√© Casgrain, a member of the √âcole patriotique (fr). The novels emphasized four prominent values: # the rural homestead (agriculture), # the family, # the language, and # religion. The novels idealized a bond with the homestead and farm life. The healthier \\"natural\\" life of the farm was contrasted with the \\"decadence\\" of the city. Above all, this type of novel revolved around continuity, traditions, and the passing down of values. Patrice Lacombe's (fr) The Paternal Farm (1846) is considered the first of this type of novel. The most popular example is Maria Chapdelaine by Louis H√©mon, which was widely translated and became well-known across Canada during the early 20th century. Trente arpents (1938) by Ringuet is another notable example. The roman du terroir more or less disappeared during the 1940s, when novels about urban life became widely read, such as those by Gabrielle Roy and Andr√© Langevin (fr); Germaine Gu√®vremont is generally considered to be the last influential writer of romans du terroir during this period of transition.William H. New, The Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada. .  Anti-terroir  Traces of the influence of the roman du terroir can be found in Qu√©b√©cois literature and culture today, sometimes nostalgic. At the same time, many novels are written in reaction against the roman du terroir style, maintaining the rural setting but exposing the sordid side of life in the countryside that was often culturally and economically impoverished. Among the \\"anti-terroirs\\" are Un Homme et son p√©ch√© by Claude-Henri Grignon,Claude- Henri Grignon at The Canadian Encyclopedia. La Scouine by Albert Laberge (fr) and Une saison dans la vie d'Emmanuel by Marie-Claire Blais. The novel Marie Calumet (fr), by Rodolphe Girard (fr), while sometimes being considered a typical example of the roman du terroir, also possesses some characteristics of the \\"anti-terroir\\". In effect, Girard lightly mocks the clergy in the novel.

As part of the Aggtelek Karst, the cave system extends more than and includes the Domica cave. The cave has a natural entrance at Aggtelek, at the foot of a high white cliff that overlooks the edge of the village. It has an articulated, meandering main channel long, with a rock tunnel, on average, wide and high with a few giant caverns. The main branch has several short and long connecting side branches. A significant part of the cave has varied colors and shapes providing an unparalleled spectacle of decorative stalactites. Subterranean river waters run through the main branch at times of flood. Natural entrances to the cave have been open from ancient times, and there are traces of Neolithic occupation. The first written mention of the cave dates from 1549. The first survey was conducted in 1794 by Joseph Sartory. In 1825 it was only known to be in length. This section was surveyed in 1802 and the first map published. In 1825 the engineer, Imre Vass explored the cave a further along the main branch, producing an accurate map and a description. His work, published in Hungarian and German was published in 1831. In order to facilitate cave visits, the first tourist walks were installed in 1806. In 1890 the Red Lake entrances were established and further exploration and extension was conducted between 1927 and 1928. Baradla, and other caves of the Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The entire cave system and the catchment areas - with the nearby Domic√°val wetlands of international importance were subject to protection in 2001 .

The truss bridge, which was constructed from wrought iron and cast iron not stone or brick arches, was built under the direction of the LSWR's chief engineer, WR Galbraith. After taking three years to build, the dual-tracked bridge opened to rail traffic in 1874. Usage was limited to certain classes of locomotive because the viaduct had an axle load limit. Although regular services were withdrawn in 1968, the bridge was used for shunting by a local quarry. In the 1990s the remaining single line was removed after the viaduct was deemed to be too weak to carry rail traffic. The crossing is now used by The Granite Way, a long-distance cycle track across Dartmoor. The viaduct, which is a scheduled monument, is now one of only two such surviving railway bridges in the United Kingdom that uses wrought iron lattice piers to support the cast iron trusses (the other is Bennerley Viaduct between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire). History In the 19th century, the LSWR was in competition with the Great Western Railway (GWR) to provide passenger trains from London to Devon and Cornwall. But as the South Devon Railway, an associate of the GWR, had already built a line from to along the south coast under the direction of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The LSWR, and its engineer, William Galbraith, were only left with a route that would have to cross the uplands of Dartmoor. Work began on Meldon Viaduct in 1871. When it opened on 12 October 1874 it was part of the LSWR's routes to Plymouth and Bude via Okehampton. Originally it carried a single track, part of the Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR, but the track was doubled in 1878 when a steel viaduct of similar design was constructed next to it and the two were joined. The construction of the second line was conducted whilst the original line remained open. In order to dispense with the need for high scaffolding, the trestles were erected by means of derricks mounted on the original structure. The trusses were constructed in a railway siding and lifted by means of two heavily-ballasted, rail-mounted cranes that were then pushed onto the original bridge and swung out into position by the cranes. Each truss could be thus installed within around two hours and thirty minutes, meaning that the work could be arranged around the railway timetable to avoid the need to close the line at any stage. The method, devised by engineer T Wrightson and supervised on site by W Jacomb, worked well and the new bridge was complete within 16 weeks of starting work. On 5 May 1931 a carpenter, F. Rook, was killed in an accident whilst replacing timber decking on the down line. Passenger services on the line were withdrawn in 1968, after which the line reverted to a single track and the viaduct was used predominantly for shunting freight trains serving the ballast quarry at Meldon. In 1970, a road was built across the viaduct to permit lorries access to the Meldon Dam construction site. The bridge was assessed in 1990 as being too weak to carry trains and the rails were removed. Six years later, the viaduct was refurbished and re- opened as part of The Granite Way, a combined cycle and foot path. It is now a scheduled monument. The viaduct is now owned by the Meldon Viaduct Company, a not-for-profit organisation set up in February 1999 to safeguard the viaduct. At various times since the closure of the line, local people and enthusiasts have campaigned for its re-opening, a campaign which gained added prominence in 2014 after severe winter storms severed the Great Western Main Line at Dawlish in February. According to Network Rail, the condition of Meldon Viaduct was a significant obstacle to the re-opening of the line and it would need to be replaced before trains could run on the line.Modern Railways, September 2014, p. 67. Design The Victorian ironwork of Meldon viaduct shows the gentle curve it makes as it spans the gorge. The viaduct is constructed of wrought iron and cast iron, one of two surviving wrought iron truss girder railway bridges in the United Kingdom. The only other surviving example is Bennerley Viaduct, between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. It consists of six warren truss spans, each of , and is supported by five lattice trestles. The original bridge (that now forms part of the up line) was constructed of a pair of trusses at centres. When the bridge was later widened to allow double track operation, a second structure of almost identical construction was erected from the original bridge with the gap spanned by timber decking. The trusses are high and the older trusses are unusual in that the tension (bottom) member is made of plate metal rather than a rolled girder. The trestles vary in height from to and are constructed of four wrought iron piers supported by horizontal and diagonal bracing. The trestle sections taper inwards from the base and rest on wide masonry bases. The viaduct is long and, at its highest point, rises above the valley. The viaduct has slight curve which, combined with its exposed position, resulted in speed and weight restrictions being applied to trains crossing it. The speed limit was set at in 1927. The trestles were strengthened in 1938 and 1944 in order to allow heavier traffic to use the viaduct during the Second World War, and further strengthening to the trestles was carried out in 1959 and 1960.

Its text, which draws from Psalm 103, was written by Anglican divine (clergyman) Henry Francis Lyte. First published in 1834, it endures in modern hymnals to a setting written by John Goss in 1868, and remains one of the most popular hymns in English-speaking denominations. History The text of the hymn was first published in Lyte‚Äôs The Spirit of the Psalms (1834), a publication intended for the use of his own congregation in southern England. It appeared in multiple influential publications, such as Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861) and The English Hymnal (1906). It remains extremely popular and John Richard Watson notes that \\"it is hard to find a major hymnbook that does not include it\\". The hymn is frequently sung in the United Kingdom and was used in the 1947 royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth II, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was also used as the opening hymn at the 2018 funeral of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Text The text is a free paraphrase of Psalm 103. While, in the mid-nineteenth century, hymn writers usually kept their metrical settings of psalm texts as close as possible to the original, Lyte instead decided to maintain the spirit of the words while freely paraphrasing them. The result speaks, in an imaginative fashion, with \\"beautiful imagery and thoughtful prose\\", of themes such as the Love of God, healing and forgiveness, including the repeated exclamations \\"Praise Him!\\", in what is a spectacular rhetorical statement of praise. In modern versions, Lyte's text has been frequently altered. One common variant, which originates in the 1861 Hymns Ancient and Modern collection, is replacing the line \\"Praise Him! Praise Him!\\" with \\"Alleluia!\\". The original fourth stanza, corresponding with verses 15‚Äì17 of the Psalm, was marked for optional omission in the original printing and many modern hymnals therefore do not include it. The text of the omitted stanza shares a \\"valedictory but hopeful tone\\" with the other well known hymn by Lyte, \\"Abide with me\\". Other more modern changes, including more gender-neutral language, are relatively minor. An alternate text, written as part of the 1980s and 1990s attempts to reduce the omnipresence of masculine metaphors for God and published as a variant in the Presbyterian Hymnal, begins \\"Praise my soul, the God of heaven\\". Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven; To His feet thy tribute bring. Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who like thee His praise should sing Praise Him ! Praise Him! Praise the everlasting King. Praise Him for His grace and favour To our fathers in distress. Praise Him still the same for ever, Slow to chide, and swift to bless Praise Him! Praise Him! Glorious in His faithfulness. Father- like He tends and spares us; Well our feeble frame He knows. In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes. Praise Him ! Praise Him ! Widely as His mercy flows. Angels, help us to adore Him Ye behold Him face to face; Sun and moon, bow down before Him, Dwellers all in time and space. Praise Him ! Praise Him ! Praise with us the God of grace. Tune The hymn is most commonly sung to the tune \\"\\" (\\"Praise, my soul\\"), written as a setting for Lyte's words by John Goss in 1868, and first published in Robert Brown- Borthwick‚Äôs Supplemental Hymn and Tune Book (Third Edition, 1869). This was an instant success, a report in the 1869 Musical Times stating that \\"it is at once the most beautiful and dignified hymn tune which has lately come under our notice\\". Paul Westermeyer notes that it has \\"been praised as one of the finest\\" hymn tunes from the Victorian period and remains much a favourite of congregations. The original setting by Goss is in D major. The first stanza is marked to be sung in unison with harmonies from the organ. The second is in four-part harmony (transcribed below), while the remaining stanzas are again in unison. A version in F-sharp minor was also composed for the original fourth stanza (now regularly omitted) in November 1868. << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\partial 2 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c << { a4 a a a d cis b2 a g4 fis b a fis g e2 fis4 fis fis fis b a a gis a b cis d fis, gis a2 d4 cis b a d cis b a b a g e d cis d2\\\\fermata\\\\bar\\"|.\\" } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { d4 d cis cis d a' a( g) fis2 d4 d d d d e cis2 cis4 e d cis b b d d cis e e d d d cis2 d4. d8 d4 cis d e8( fis) g4 g fis e d b a a a2 } >> } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricmode { } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c << { fis4 fis g g a a b( cis) d2 g,4 a g a b b a( g) fis cis d e fis b b b a d cis a b b a2 a4. a8 g4 g fis e8( d) e4 a d cis b g fis e8( g) fis2 } \\\\\\\\\\\\ { d4 d e e fis fis g2 d b4 d g fis b e, a,2 ais4 ais b cis d dis e eis fis gis a fis d e a,2 fis'4. fis,8 g4 a b4. b8 cis4 cis d e8( fis) g4 g, a a d2\\\\fermata } >> } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 4 = 100 } An alternative tune is \\"Regent Square\\", originally written by Henry Smart for \\"Glory be to God the Father\\" by Horatius Bonar.

Early life and education Born in Nagysall√≥, Hungary, he was educated at grammar school in Esztergom until 1913. His father was a doctor who passed on an interest in zoology to his son. His education was interrupted by the First World War where he served three and a half years at the front. He returned to the natural history and geography faculty of the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University, Budapest, and obtained a teaching diploma in 1920. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Szeged in 1922. Career From 1919 Dudich worked at the Zoological Department of the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest. He became a university lecturer in 1925 and, in 1934, as associate professor, he established the first Systematic Zoology and Animal Geographical Institute within P√°zm√°ny P√©ter University. In 1936 he was appointed and established as professor. Endre Dudich was commissioned to establish the Institute for Danube Research Station in Lower G√∂d which he led from 1958 to 1970, and the initiation of the institutional zoological research cave at Baradla cave. His book on Systematic Zoology co-authored with former student, Imre Loksa, became a standard text on the subject. He chaired the Hungarian Academy of Sciences a total of four times; as corresponding member in 1932 and elected full member in 1942. For political reasons he was deprived of academic membership in 1949 but regained the chair in 1951 as corresponding member, and was elected a full member again in 1964. He was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1957. He remained at the university until his death in February 1971. The Institute was subsequently headed by his former students; J√°nos Balogh and Imre Loksa. The Institute's modern successor is the Institute of Systematic Zoology and Ecology, E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. Key research areas * Beetles (Coleoptera) taxonomy and geography * Crustacean taxonomy, anatomy and animal geography * Biometric methods for the examination of morphological variability * Local aquatic habitats, hydrobiology * Karst - and speleology * Forest soils Arthropod production, biological testing (Janos Balogh and Imre Loksa) =Cave and Karst research= His work as a researcher on caves and karst and their fauna started through his friendship with Elem√©r Bokor. He became a founder and committee member of the Hungarian Speleological Society in 1926. Dudich started research on flora and fauna of the Baradla cave at Aggtelek, often working under very difficult and often miserable conditions. His research went beyond cave fauna, laying the foundation of modern zoology. The Department of Zoology published his results under the title of The Aggtelek cave flora and fauna food resources in 1930, and in 1931 the Hungarian Natural History Society awarded him the ' (Margins Award). A more speleological work-related travel book was published in 1932; The Aggtelek stalactite cave and its surroundings. In 1932 his work was published as part of a series of speleology monographs ' (Biology of the Aggtelek stalactite cave Baradla in Hungary). This extensive 246 page work for one of the leading European cave biology societies established his name. In 1934 Benno Wolf invited him to write the introduction of '. In 1958 the world's fourth cave biological laboratory was built at the Baradla cave and laboratory work dominated the rest of Dudich's life. That same year the Hungarian Karst and Cave Research Association re- formed. Dudich chaired the Association's committee from 1961 to 1965 and between 1959 and 1965 Dudich was editor of the Association's Cave and Karst Research journal. His contribution to science was recognised by the award of the Kadiƒá Ottok√°r medal. In 1968 he was made honorary member and honorary president of the Society and remained in office until his death. Dudich's unstinting efforts revitalised cave biology research, encouraging young researchers to pursue cave fauna studies.

Objectives  The main force behind the establishment of NorDubCo was the belief that local government, local development agencies, Dublin City University and local communities working together could make a difference to the region. Throughout this period, NorDubCo has worked to ensure that sustainable social, economic and civic development takes place in the region. To achieve these objectives NorDubCo works with representatives from a wide variety of civil society sectors: the business community, local government, the local development sector, public representatives (both local and national), education establishments, the media and state and semi state institutions.  Public Dialogue  In order to contribute towards a form of negotiated governance NorDubco devised a Public Dialogue Programme in conjunction with Dublin City University. They introduced the annual Martin McEvoy Seminar Series in 2002. This commemorates the former chairperson of NorDubCo who served as Chairperson from 1999 until 2007. Each year the Series attempts to address issues of contemporary concern. For example, last year's Seminar was entitled 'Adapting to Climate Change: Social Sciences Shaping the Public Policy Response at Local Level' and discussed how carbon mitigation programmes will impact locally on production, jobs, consumption, mobility and the quality of life and how social sciences can aid the transition towards a low carbon economy and society.  Publications and Applied Research  It achieves its stated aims by primarily the publication of research and also hosting seminars, conferences and briefings and by presence on the boards of government and local authority agencies. To give some perspective of the type of work undertaken over the last few years it has undertaken research work in a wide variety of areas:- The North Dublin Skills and Employment Analysis The cultural needs of economic migrants in North Dublin An assessment of enterprise space in North Dublin The Real Cost of Applying for Public Funding An Analysis of the Impact of the National Asset Management Agency in North Dublin  Recent Developments  NorDubCo has recently partnered with Bangor University and Dublin City University to develop the Menter Iontach Nua programme to develop a learning, networking and support initiative to improve the entrepreneurial skills of social enterprise. The learning programme will provide students with a master's degree in Innovation and Social Enterprise. Menter Iontach Nua has been part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund through the Ireland Wales Programme 2007-2013 (InterReg 4A) and will run until December 2014.

Life  He studied at the St√§delschule from 1842 to 1846, where his teachers included , Jakob Becker and Philipp Veit, who suggested that he go to Munich. Burger did so in 1846, but returned after two years. In 1851, he married his childhood sweetheart Katharina Elise Heislitz. Two years later, he took a study trip to Paris with some friends, where he met Camille Corot and Gustave Courbet. His wife died in 1856 and, in 1858, he moved to Kronberg. The following year, he took a trip to Antwerp and Amsterdam, where he was heavily influenced by the Old Masters. On his return, he married Anna Johanna Auguste K√ºster, the daughter of Kronberg's most prominent doctor. She died in 1876. In 1861, he and Jakob F√ºrchtegott Dielmann (an old friend from his days at the St√§delschule) founded the Kronberg Artists' Colony, where he remained until his death. He was highly regarded and came to be known as the \\"King of Kronberg\\". In 1882 he married again, this time to a former student, Pauline Fresenius, who was slightly more than thirty years his junior. He was appointed a Royal Prussian Professor in 1894. He was a prolific and versatile painter, producing works in almost every genre. His paintings sold very well and, in the area around Kronberg, it was considered a sign of good taste to have a \\"Burger\\" in one's home.

ARHCC opened in 2008 as: * the first new hospital built in the province in 30 years, * the first hospital in Western Canada to have a cancer centre integrated in its design from the ground up, * Canada's first newly constructed hospital to meet LEED Gold environmentally friendly standards, * the largest construction project to date in the Fraser Valley, * the first in the province to be built using a (P3) public-private partnership model. It is also the city's largest worksite in terms of number of employees.  Health services  The facility offers both inpatient and outpatient services to residents of Abbotsford and regional services to other communities in the eastern Fraser Valley (Mission, Chilliwack, Hope, etc.) = Hospital services = Fraser Health's Abbotsford Regional Hospital provides community hospital services to Abbotsford residents and regional services to about 330,000 residents of the eastern Fraser Valley.

East entrance to Ambulatory Care at ARHCC = Replacement of MSA Hospital = ARHCC was a state-of-the-art replacement for the obsolete MSA (Matsqui-Sumas-Abbotsford) General Hospital which was built in 1953 and was criticized as undersized by the time of its last major renovation in 1980. The community served by MSA grew substantially in recent decades and the three districts amalgamated to form the City of Abbotsford after a plebiscite in 1995. By the turn of the century, replacement of MSA Hospital was a political issue for the growing Fraser Valley community. After Gordon Campbell was elected as Premier of British Columbia in 2001, his local cabinet ministers Michael de Jong, John van Dongen and Mission MLA Randy Hawes advocated for construction of a new, larger hospital and addition of a regional cancer centre using a (P3) public-private partnership model. = Public-private partnership (P3) = Design, construction and facility maintenance services are provided by private partner Access Health Abbotsford, a consortium of companies including Sodexo, under a 30-year contract. The design reduced energy costs and environmental features that earned the hospital designation as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold by the Canada Green Building Council. ARHCC was the first P3 infrastructure project for the province's newly created agency Partnerships BC. As a new model for BC public infrastructure, the P3 approach attracted criticism from groups such as Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. In the end, ARHCC was built on time and on budget ($355 million for construction and equipment) and the Auditor General of British Columbia assured the P3 approach would benefit government by $39 million over 30 years. Fraser Valley taxpayers contributed $71.3 million to construction and equipment costs through the Fraser Valley Regional Hospital District. = Opening = MSA Hospital was closed and inpatients transported to ARHCC on opening day, August 24, 2008. At 60,000 square metres, the 300-bed ARHCC is almost three times the physical size of the 188-bed MSA facility. The opening ceremony occurred in September 2008. Dignitaries included Premier of British Columbia Gordon Campbell, Health Minister George Abbott and Abbotsford Mayor George Ferguson. Patients volumes increased after opening in part due to residents of nearby communities checking out the modern facility and continued population growth in the region.

Joshua Hett Smith House (demolished), also known as Treason House, was a historic house in West Haverstraw, New York. It stood on a hill overlooking the King's Ferry at Stony Point, an important crossing of the Hudson River. During the American Revolutionary War, General Benedict Arnold met at the house with British Major John Andr√©, while plotting to surrender the fort at West Point. Later, the house had a brief tenure as headquarters for General George Washington. Early history The house was built about 1770 on the property of Thomas Smith, a lawyer in New York City, who inherited the land following the 1769 death of his father, Judge William Smith. Judge Smith had been a major property owner in the area, and his holdings were divided among his six sons and several daughters. Another son was Joshua Hett Smith, who was living in this house he called \\"Belmont\\" in 1780.Frank Bertangue Green, The History of Rockland County (1880), p. 93. Arnold Arnold became a celebrated hero early in the Revolutionary War. Severely wounded in the 1777 Battles of Saratoga, his shattered left leg left him unable to ride a horse or walk without pain. In June 1778, he was made military governor of southeast Pennsylvania, stationed in Philadelphia. His taste for high living and use of soldiers for personal tasks made him unpopular. In April 1779, he married Peggy Shippen, the daughter of a prominent Tory. That same month, he began a treasonous correspondence with British General Henry Clinton. By the summer, he was informing Clinton of American troop locations and strengths, and negotiating a fee to switch sides. Arnold angrily resigned his military command of Philadelphia in March 1780, in response to a Congressional inquiry into expenses he incurred during the failed 1775‚Äì76 invasion of Quebec and an upcoming court-martial (in April, at which he was cleared of all but minor charges). In mid-July 1780, he wrote to Clinton offering to surrender the fort at West Point for ¬£20,000.Randall (1990), pp. 508-509. It was not until July 31 that he met with Washington to request command of the fort, and August 3 when he was installed as its commander. The fort at West Point, located on a hill above a narrow bend in the Hudson River, was the key military site for defending the river. The British believed that control of the river would isolate New England from the rest of the Colonies, and cause the rebellion to fail.Randall (1990), pp. 505‚Äì508. While en route to West Point, Arnold renewed his acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith, who had spied for both sides.Randall (1990), p. 517‚Äì518. They were co-conspirators by September 10, when the general stayed overnight at Smith's house, located about 15 miles south of the fort. A meeting with Major Andr√© was to take place in the early morning hours of September 11, but the rendezvous had to be abandoned when Smith's rowboat was fired upon.Randall (1990), p. 533. Arnold and Andr√© finally met before dawn on September 22: Andr√© sailed up the Hudson River aboard ; a rowboat containing Arnold and Smith (and two of Smith's allies rowing) met the British warship mid-river and carried Andr√© to the western shore. Arnold and Andr√© talked through the night at Smith's house, but the Vulture was fired upon and moved downriver, stranding the British major behind American lines. Andr√©, despite being given a pass signed by Arnold, was captured, tried as a spy, and hanged. Arnold made it safely to New York City, where he was given a commission in the British Army. Joshua Hett Smith Joshua Hett Smith (May 27, 1749 ‚Äì 1818) was the son of Judge William Smith and brother of Chief Justice of the Province of New York William Smith. > Joshua Hett Smith, at whose house, near Stony Point, Arnold and Andr√© held > their interview (September 22), was tried by a military court and acquitted. > He was soon afterwards arrested by the civil authorities and committed to > jail at Goshen, Orange County, whence he escaped and made his way through > the country, in the disguise of a woman, to New York.

The American and French armies were then on the march to Yorktown, Virginia, and it took four days to ferry the troops, horses, wagons and cannons across the Hudson River.

After working as a clerk and freighter around Pembina, North Dakota he opened a trading post in 1871 at Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan then a M√©tis hivernant settlement. He married Marie Ouellette in 1873 who bore him a son Albert Joseph. His wife died in 1876 and he never remarried.

By 1879 the Sioux were destitute because the buffalo had disappeared from the area. L√©gar√© spent a great deal of effort and supplies to feed the starving Sioux. Since the U.S. government offered amnesty and supplies L√©gar√© at the request of L.N.F. Crozier (NWMP) persuaded them to return to the United States.

It initially began as the Duke Employees Benevolent Society in February 1965, led by Oliver Harvey. The formation of Local 77 was directed towards improving work conditions for the working class employees, most of whom were African- American. Members fought for minimum wage increases, improvements in working conditions, and medical benefits for employees. The union members of Local 77 demanded a systematic way of dealing with workplace complaints that were impartial to the Duke University administration. Because the majority of the union's members were African-American, several of the goals overlapped with the ideas of the Civil Rights Movement.  Historical context  The first steps towards inclusion of black Durham residents in the work force occurred during World War II, when the federal government reluctantly allowed black workers to fill up open job positions in Durham, left by those who went to fight in the war. What seemed a promising step towards civil rights efforts faded as soldiers returned at the end of the war to reclaim their positions in society. Both black men and women lost their factory jobs at the shutdown of several major wartime plants that were no longer needed post-war.Karen Brodkin, Caring by the Hour: Women, Work, and Organizing at Duke Medical Center(Urbana: University of Illinois, 1988), 39. Oliver Harvey, who later led the organizational efforts of Local 77, was affected by the wartime demand for black employees. = Oliver Harvey = Born in Franklinton, North Carolina, a small textile and tobacco town, Harvey grew up alongside his father who owned his own land, which was very uncommon for black farmers in the 1930s. When his tenants stole from his property, Harvey's father lost his land. Refusing to join the sharecropping business, Harvey looked for work in Durham. In 1936, Harvey found a job at the American Tobacco Company where the segregated unions troubled him. In a journal article about his father, the younger Harvey wrote, ‚ÄúI got my hatred for segregation from my father. He was raised up in the house of a white couple, two liberal lawyers. He learned to always speak up for himself.‚Äù In 1943, Harvey worked at the Krueger Bottling Company in Durham where he successfully led efforts to integrate the segregated black and white unions. During the black union protest against the segregated pay scales, forty-four out of the forty-five whites in the plant joined the black union in their strike.\\"Oliver Harvey: Got to Take Some Risks.\\" Southern Exposure 6 (1978): n. pag. Web. 17 Mar. 2014. Eight years later, Harvey began work as a nighttime janitor at Duke University where he encountered a discouraging atmosphere for social change. Duke was a segregated school at the time, as all Southern institutions were, and was not integrated until 1963. Even following integration, racial inequality still existed during the Civil Rights Movement. Black workers were to address students by ‚ÄúMister‚Äù and ‚ÄúMiss,‚Äù though the reverse was not required of the students. Harvey's confrontation with a student who objected to this rule led to the end of this practice.\\"Oliver Harvey: Got to Take Some Risks.\\" His insistence for more respect towards university workers suggested that the goals of the labor union extended beyond the need for fair wages, but also for independence, credibility, and authority, matching the goals of the Civil Rights Movement at the time.  Conflicts leading up to unionization  While Duke University's reputation grew as a national educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke's status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities.Erik Ludwig, \\"Closing in on the Plantation: Coalition Building and the Role of Black Women's Grievances in Duke University Labor Disputes, 1965-1968,\\" Feminist Studies 25.1 (1999): 79-94, accessed March 18, 2014. Despite Duke University's reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse's maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: ‚ÄúWhen I was a nurse‚Äôs maid, our second head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere‚Äîuptown to get the immunizations and to put them in my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.‚ÄùBrodkin, Caring by the Hour, 44. It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers. The administration initially denied the union recognition. While the university discouraged the formation of labor unions, arguing that ‚Äúit can do more ‚Äòfor‚Äô the employee than a union,‚Äù Local 77 denounced this idea as ‚Äúdeepening the basic problem,‚Äù suggesting that ‚ÄúEmployees need to have a voice in their own future; and that voice can only come through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral decision-making power. Only then will the psychology of dependence be overcome.‚ÄùWhy Local 77, Box 1, Labor Unions Reference Collection, 1958-2001, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.  Union conflicts and its societal effects  = Hattie Williams, Viola Watson, and the opposition toward labor unions = The cases of Hattie Williams and Viola Watson highlighted the difficulties of labor organizing on Duke's campus. Initially, unionization efforts had little effect on working conditions because of a historically unwelcoming environment for labor unions, and the resulting lack of recognition by the University's entire population. At first, employees attained only minor improvements in pay, and a new grievance procedure easily manipulated by management and administrators.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 81. In the case of Hattie Williams and Viola Watson, members involved with Local 77 and African- American housekeepers who had worked for at least four years, were fired without warning in the winter of 1966. Both workers received no complaints about the quality of their work. However, both previously involved themselves in the Local 77 movement; Williams was a Union Steward and Watson had picketed for higher wages with the union.Statement of Policy, Box 1, Labor Unions Reference Collection, 1958-2001, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. They used the grievance procedure to reclaim their positions in the University. However, only Hattie Williams was returned to her job while Watson was denied permission to her previous position.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 81. The Local 77 Statement of Policy pointed out the inconsistency of the present Duke policies ruling out previous segregationist practices, as discrimination still existed, and believed it was too easy ‚Äúfor lower Management to work in clear violation of the University‚Äôs avowed policy.‚Äù Statement of Policy, Labor Unions Reference Collection. The last step of the grievance procedure, a meeting between three members of the Personnel Policy Committee closely tied to the University, claimed to be ‚Äúperfectly objective in rendering a final decision‚Äù for the Williams and Watson case. However, in his letter to university president Douglas Knight, Harvey proposed that ‚Äúif Duke truly wishes to be fair in its dealings with employees, a disinterested third party should constitute the final appeal on grievances.‚Äù A Newsletter from Duke Employees Local 77, Box 1, Labor Unions Reference Collection, 1958-2001, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. The primary goal of Local 77 was to gain impartial arbitration as a way to settle disputes objectively, allowing the participation of a third party to discern final judgments. = Shirley Ramsey: garnering student and faculty support = Despite initial failures and the slow progress of Local 77's new campaign, Local 77 gained momentum as they received more support from students and faculty. In the spring of 1966, Shirley Ramsey, one of the first black food service workers to be promoted to cashier, was requested by a supervisor to perform pie-cutting duties in the dining hall, a task outside the range of her job description. When Ramsey refused the supervisor's request, she was fired from her job. Consequently, Ramsey filed a claim through the grievance procedure, believing that race was a determining factor for the reason that she was singled out by her employer to perform a task outside of her job description.Christina Greene, Our Separate Ways: Women and the Black Freedom Movement in Durham, North Carolina (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2005), 107. In the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, the issue of race as a factor in Ramsey's case attracted the support of students and faculty, along with media coverage. The union submitted a letter to the editor for The Chronicle, explaining details surrounding the controversy of Ramsey's firing. Many Duke students who were also involved in the work setting as part-time workers wore buttons to show their support. Despite the overwhelming support, the judges of Ramsey's case rejected her complaint at the last stage and denied the association of race with her firing, stating that ‚Äúsuccessful operation of the dining halls depended upon the willingness of the employees to respond to rapidly changing situations caused by the very nature of the business.‚Äù Letter from John M. Dozier to Shirley Ramsey, Box 1, Labor Unions Reference Collection, 1958-2001, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Cleverly avoiding the matter from the standpoint of race relations, the administration solely regarded the relocation of Ramsey as a matter of employee compliance to their supervisors. Nevertheless, the collective effort of the entire Duke community behind Ramsey's case encouraged workers to continue challenging the work conditions based on race. = Iola Woods: union representation in grievance procedures = Motivated by the widespread community support, Local 77 continued to fight against an apathetic and blatantly racist administration. In response to a faculty supporter's letter urging him to comply with the black workers' demands, university president Douglas Knight denied any support stating, \\"It is far more important both for the University and the region to make certain that salaries continue to rise for more skilled people than those who receive minimum compensation\\" and continues to propose an offensive solution to the problem by \\"eliminating employees who can work only at a minimum level of effectiveness.\\" ‚ÄúKnight to Strange letter, March 11, 1965,‚Äù Duke University Archives, Sect.25, John Strange folder, as quoted in Brodkin, Caring by the Hour, 48. Knight responded as if their low-class jobs were a privilege, implying the incompetency of black workers for minimum wage working conditions. Not soon afterwards, the university hired the Alexander Proudfoot Corporation, an efficiency firm, whose goal was to reduce university operating costs especially in the service and clerical sectors, including the jobs held by black workers.Brodkin, Caring by the Hour, 49. When workloads increased by an average of 81 percent, complaints from workers resulted. Among those complaints was Iola Woods, a dormitory maid who was assigned to clean 12 rooms, empty the trash of 24 rooms, and clean two dorm bathrooms in one hour and twenty minutes. This led 42 maids to file grievances with the administration for modifications in their workload. In support of the maids‚Äô protests, student and faculty supporters established a committee, the Students, Faculty, and Friends of Local 77 (SFFL), which assisted the labor union in its fight for fair work conditions.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 85. During an investigation of work conditions, three students unsuccessfully tried to complete the work assigned to maids.The Need for Impartial Arbitration of Labor Disputes at Duke University, Box 1, Labor Unions Reference Collection, 1958-2001, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. Furthermore, the SFFL examined the maids‚Äô work schedules for inconsistencies, and found that they had significantly more tasks at different times of the day.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 85. The SFFL continued to raise awareness for the need of impartial arbitration. When the administration offered no response to the SFFL proposals for impartial arbitration, union members began picketing in spring of 1967 outside the administrative building and Duke Medical Center. After a week of protests, the university finally agreed to negotiations with Local 77 in establishing a new grievance panel that included the participation of a third party. The union had the ability to choose one out of the three members on the panel.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 86. While this process was still biased towards administration, this was the first step towards future improvement. = Silent Vigil and worker demands = After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the Duke community gathered together during the Silent Vigil to raise awareness for racial equality on campus, presenting an opportunity for Local 77 to accentuate both their workplace and racial equality concerns. Duke students, faculty, and administration immersed in social equality reflections and negotiations over university policies protecting these rights. Local 77's participation in the Silent Vigil contributed to the issue of race relations as a whole. As Rees Shearer eloquently described the role of Local 77's presence at the Vigil, ‚ÄúIn reflection, I think we needed Local #77 more than they needed us. We needed a way to express regret, to dissociate ourselves from the assassination and to try to do something right about the dominant issue of our nation: race.‚Äù Bridget Booher, ‚ÄúRemembering the Silent Vigil,‚Äù Duke Magazine, March‚ÄìApril 1998. This had been an issue long avoided by the Duke community and the divided nation. Motivated by the struggle for social equality, more than a thousand students and faculty demonstrated on the campus quad, boycotting the dining halls.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 89. Workers picketed for a $1.60 minimum wage, collective bargaining rights, and an impartial grievance procedure.Brodkin, Caring by the Hour, 52. After a strike that lasted for thirteen days, attracting national media attention, the administration complied with requests to raise the minimum wage. However, the administration continued to refuse collective bargaining rights. Instead, they implemented the Duke University Employees Advisory Committee, a faculty committee that negotiated with nonacademic workers. This included the participation of ‚Äútwelve technical and clerical worker representatives along with twelve service and maintenance worker representatives.‚Äù Brodkin, Caring by the Hour, 53.  Recognition by the University  In fall of 1970, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) gave workers the right to form unions in private universities. However, the NLRB ruling only granted collective bargaining rights to non-hospital workers. At the time, Local 77 was composed of both hospital and campus service workers, and hospital workers strongly supported Local 77. Several hospital workers in Local 77 held manual tasks that did not involve patient care, and in the end, the ruling permitted these workers for union representation. By 1971, Duke voluntarily agreed to the unionization of both housekeeping and laundry workers in the medical center and campus workers. Harvey perceived this as Duke's strategy for preventing future unionizing pressure from other food and service workers in the medical center. After the long enduring fight for fair working conditions, Local 77 finally received union recognition in January, 1972.Brodkin, Caring by the Hour, 55-56. Following the Civil Rights Movement, most students held liberal views on social equality issues. However, student support decreased by a change in the general student body's ‚Äúembrace of a liberal individualist theology.‚Äù Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 82. This followed the idea that the younger generation found more meaning in one-to-one environments rather than working through a matter systematically and questioning institutional policies. This was seemingly demonstrated when the university discussed the privatization of dining services in 1998. The introduction of fast-food chains on campus oftentimes refused hiring employees affiliated with labor unions, reducing the demand for unionized labor that Local 77 represented. More than 80 percent of the student body favored the administration's proposal, despite the fact that the primarily black work force would be earning less than Durham's living wage.Ludwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 91. While the Local 77 movement in the 1960s succeeded in extending racial equality towards the predominantly black labor unions, the lack of student support in the following years hindered further improvements for a demographic group with much less power than Duke's administration. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the unsuccessful unionization drives at Duke University's hospital. Although public support had decreased, Local 77 built a strong foundation for itself in its campaign during the 1960s. The labor union reached its goals of attaining higher pay, fair treatment in the workplace, and showing that they were ‚Äúa force within the very institution that had marginalized them.‚ÄùLudwig, ‚ÄúClosing in on the Plantation,‚Äù 92.

It was built by order of Lieutenant (Teniente) Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo to house the Mexican soldiers that had been transferred from the Presidio of San Francisco in 1835. The Presidio Company and their commander, Lieutenant Vallejo, were also responsible for controlling the Native Americans living on the northern border of Mexican California. On June 14, 1846 the Pueblo of Sonoma was taken over by a group of American immigrants seeking to establish their own California Republic. The Barracks became the headquarters this short-lived insurrection later known as the Bear Flag Revolt. Believing that war with Mexico had been declared, ships of the U.S. Pacific Squadron took over Monterey on July 7 and Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) on July 9, 1846. The U. S. flag was raised at the Barracks that same day - ending the California Republic and the Bear Flag Revolt. After that, the Barracks was used by U.S. forces until 1852.S/PSHPA Throughout the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the subsequent California Gold Rush these forces continued to confront Native Americans hostile to invaders occupying their lands.SSHP p.82 When the military left, the building was used for a number of civilian purposes until being acquired by the State of California in 1957. The Sonoma Barracks is now part of Sonoma State Historic Park. Mexican Military Mariano Vallejo as a Young Man Soldiers of the Company of the National Presidio at San Francisco (Compania de Presidio Nacional de San Francisco) moved to the site of the recently secularized Mission San Francisco Solano in 1835. California Governor Jose Figueroa had ordered the Company north from the Presidio of San Francisco as part of his plan to comply with instructions from the national government to establish a strong garrison in the region north of the San Francisco Bay to protect the area from encroachments of foreigners.Bancroft 3:246 An immediate concern was further eastward movement of the Russian America Company from their settlements on the California coast.Smilie p.54 Construction of the Barracks was episodic: digging the foundation began in 1837, construction of the adobe walls in 1839 and the building was more or less completed in 1840 to '41.SSHP p.15 Until the building was habitable the troops were housed in the buildings of the old Mission.Stammerjohan p.25 While the barracks was built to house troops, most of the space was used as a headquarters and for supply, equipment and weapons storage. Interpretation of the Barracks interior during the Mexican Period The Company's commander, Lieutenant Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, was named Military Commander of the Northern Frontier, thus taking responsibility for maintaining control over the Native population north of the Bay. Vallejo's approach to controlling the border region combined direct military action, treaties with native groups, and by forming alliances with Indian leaders on the west (Chief Marin) and east (Chief Solano - who provided auxiliary men when the Company way fighting other Native groups). While based in Sonoma, the Company participated in over 100 activities to maintain control over the areas Native peoples. Bancroft opines that ‚Äú‚Ä¶Vallejo‚Äôs Indian policy must be regarded as excellent and effective when compared to any other policy ever followed in California.‚ÄùBancroft 4:70 The Company did receive support in money and materiel from the Mexican and California governments but Vallejo absorbed the deficits out of his own funds. All the other presidial companies in Alta California had been replaced by civilian militias by the time the San Francisco Company moved to Sonoma.Bancroft 3:583,591-92 Lieutenant Colonel Vallejo disbanded the Presidial Company on November 28, 1844 with the plea that he could not longer afford paying for them. Among his other reasons may have been avoiding being drawn into a rebellion against Governor Micheltorena by his nephew Juan Alvarado and childhood friend Jos√© Castro.Bancroft 4:465Stammerjohan p.41 After releasing the soldiers, Vallejo retained the weapons and military supplies stored in the Barracks for the use of the civilian militia. (Nine old cannon of various sizes, two hundred long infantry muskets, fifty carbines, cannon and musket balls and a small amount of black powder.) The Sonoma Barracks was also, for a short period, the home and headquarters of the Compania de Infanteria Permanente de Sonoma, a regular Mexican Infantry Company composed of young, not-so-willing Californio draftees. Bear Flag Revolt Emblem of the Bear Flag used at Sonoma On June 10, 1846 a group of dissatisfied and fearful American immigrants with a murky relationship to U.S. Army Brevet Captain John Charles Fr√©mont had captured a herd of Californian government horses which they feared would be used against them.Bancroft 5:101-108 They next determined to seize the Pueblo of Sonoma to deny the Californians a rallying point north of San Francisco Bay.Bancroft 5:109 Capturing the arms and military materiel (stored in the Barracks) and Lieutenant Colonel Vallejo would delay any military response from the Californians. Before dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846 thirty-three of the American rebels arrived in Sonoma. They accomplished their objectives, without ever firing a shot, by 11:00 AM. At that time, Vallejo and three of his associates were placed on horseback and taken to Fr√©mont near Sacramento with eight or nine of the insurgents who did not favor forming a new republic.Bancroft 5:117 The Barracks became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-five who founded the new California Republic and created its Bear Flag. The rebellion subsequently became known as the Bear Flag Revolt. Other immigrants and their families began moving into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon taken from the Barracks. Some families were housed in the Barracks - others in the homes of the Californians. Captain John Charles Fr√©mont and his mapping expedition group arrived in Sonoma on June 24, throwing off any pretense of neutrality.Bancroft 5:170 On July 5 Fr√©mont proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military group under his command. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the California Battalion signed or made their mark.Bancroft 5:178-80 The next day Fr√©mont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter's Fort They took with them two of the captured field pieces as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle.Bancroft 5:184-5 United States Military 27 Star US Flag Seven weeks after war with Mexico had been declared in Washington, D.C., Commodore John D. Sloat, commander of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron, after being assured that war with Mexico had been declared, instructed the captains of his ships to occupy Monterey on July 7 and Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) on July 9. Early on July 9 - Navy Lt. Joseph Revere was sent to Sonoma carrying two 27-star United States flags for the Sonoma Barracks and Sutter's Fort (the squadron had run out of new flags that reflected Texas‚Äô admittance to the Union). Raising the Stars and Stripes in front of the Barracks marked the end of the Bear Flag Revolt and the California Republic.Bancroft 5:185-6 The majority of the California Battalion was transported to San Diego by the U. S. Navy to assist in securing California for the United States. The Barracks served as housing for a number of former Bears and their families after the California Battalion left. Most of those remaining Bears eventually returned to their homes. The Sonoma Alcalde complained to the U.S. Navy about the lack of protection for the town and a detachment of U.S. Marines was assigned to the Sonoma Barracks.Stammerjohan p.59 The Navy completed the planking of the second floor, raised the roof and replaced the roof tile with shingles. In March, 1847, the Marines were replaced by Company \\"C\\" of what was called Stevenson's New York Volunteers.Stammerjohan p.63 The enlistments of the New York Volunteers ended with the war and they were replaced in May, 1849, by a 37-man company of U.S. dragoons (Company C, 1st U.S. Dragoons) who moved into the Barracks and established Camp Sonoma. Sonoma lost its military population in January, 1852, when the troops moved to Benicia and other assignments in California and Oregon.Alexander p.26 The Army continued to use part of the Barracks as a supply depot until August 1853. Soon after the military left the building Vallejo filed a claim of $20,600 with the U.S. Army for back-rent. After several years the claim reached the Court of Claims where it was contested by the U.S. Solicitor General on a number of bases. The Court awarded Vallejo a reduced amount ($12,600) based upon a lower rental rate and shorter rental period than was originally claimed.Court of ClaimsBancroft 5:468 Civilian Uses In July 2014, the Barracks was used as the location for a play. Alexander J. Cox rented the two eastern rooms of the first floor from Vallejo and published the Sonoma Bulletin from 1852 to 1855. Shortly after Cox left, Vallejo established a winery in the building. In 1862 he leased wine-making equipment in the building to Dr. Victor Faure for $50 per month for a five-year period. Vallejo retained the right to use the equipment and store wine in the cellar. Other parts of the building were leased in 1865 to the Aguillon family as a residence. Vallejo‚Äôs two sons, Uladislao and Napoleon leased part of the building in 1872-73 for their winemaking operation in exchange for one quarter of the profits. Mr. Newman rented part of the building in 1877 to grow silk worms experimentally.SSHP p.83 Vallejo sold the barracks building to Solomon Shocken, June 15, 1879. Shocken remodeled the exterior, including a Victorian facade, and sold agricultural implements and groceries. The building retained the Victorian image until the 1930s when it was purchased and refurbished by Walter and Celeste Murphy who lived in the building until 1957. It was then acquired and restored to its appearance at the time of the Bear Flag Revolt by the State of California and made part of the Sonoma State Historic Park.

After the F.B.I and others tried to contact the investigator for more information about the search, Mitchell admitted that he fabricated the story. Mitchell said that a Chicago firm did search Love office and car, But they found nothing. Mitchell said he created the story for many reasons, most notably to discourage the possibility of future wiretaps and to test the effectiveness of the Chicago Police Department for Love's safety. Mitchell claimed it was all his idea and that Love knew nothing about the story being false.'Bugging' a Hoax, School Board Aide Admits in Chicago: The Washington Post (April 24, 1981) On April 23, 1981, Love held a news conference announcing Mitchell's resignation and publicly apologized to the school board and mayor Byrne: \\"I had no knowledge of this discrepancy when it was reported to the board and public. I apologize for bringing this embarrassment to the city and to the Chicago schools.\\" People questioned Love's involvement in the hoax when Chicago Tribune reporter Vernon Jarrett quoted Love saying she had seen the electronic bugs herself and telling board members that she saw wires that led straight to Chicago's City Hall. Mayor Byrne referred to the bugging situation as \\"disgusting\\". =Love v. Byrne= During the Chicago mayoral election campaign in late‚Äì1982, Love chose not to attend public appearances with Byrne upon her request. Love stated that she objected to the mayor using her picture and name in her campaign literature. Despite being hired under the Byrne administration, Love decided not to identify herself as being connected to the administration; ultimately deciding not to endorse Byrne in her 1983 re‚Äìelection bid. During an interview with Chicago Tribune reporter Vernon Jarrett, Jarrett asked Love was she the superintendent of school because Byrne chose her; Love was quoted saying \\"That is not my understanding. I have a pretty good knowledge of how I was chosen and of the individual school board members who had enough faith in me and my reputation to push for my appointment. I do not feel obligated to any public figure.\\" After losing the vote to not serve as superintendent in July 1984, Love reached out to Byrne via. phone call in August 1984; asking her to sway board members who she had appointed to vote in her favor. Byrne stated to Love that her appointees were split in the contract votes and that she wouldn't intervene on their decisions. =CTU strikes of 1983 and 1984= During Love's tenure as superintendent, There were two Chicago Teacher's Union strikes; one in 1983 that lasted 15 days and a 10 day strike in 1984.

Love claimed she made that decision for the sake of the high school seniors who would need credits to graduate. In statements to local news organizations, Love likened the tension between herself and the strikers at one school to being attacked by a group of \\"vicious dogs\\". The strike was ended with Love and the school board giving the teacher's a 5% raise, 2.5% bonus and a one-year pact. =End of tenure= In July 1984, The school board made up of eleven members; three Hispanics, four Whites and four African‚ÄìAmericans voted 6‚Äì5 to not renew Love's contract as superintendent which expired in March 1985. Love sued the board and allies of mayor Harold Washington for $12 million, charging them with sexism and racism. Love claimed that her civil rights were violated when she was denied a new contract, charging that three Hispanic and white board members who voted against the renewal of her contract were racist in October 1984. Love asked a judge to order her re-instated by the Chicago Board of Education as superintendent under the guides Love claiming she had been removed from office in a discriminatory manner in November 1984.

The division distinguished itself in at least three battles. It was partly credited with the liberation of the cities of Orsha and Minsk in the first stages of the Destruction of Army Group Center. Shortly after it also shared credit for the liberation of the city of Grodno.  1st Formation  The division was first organized as the 220th Motorized Rifle Division beginning in April, 1941 in the area of Smolensk. It was commanded by Maj. Gen. Nikifor Gordeevich Khoruzhenko and consisted of: * 653rd Motorized Rifle Regiment * 673rd Motorized Rifle Regiment * 137th Tank RegimentCharles C.

Trucks and other motor vehicles were in short supply, and the tank regiment likely had no tanks at all. For practical purposes the division was motorized in name only, and within a month the decision was made to reform the 220th as a standard rifle division. The division operated as part of the 23rd Mechanized Corps, itself part of 19th Army in June and July, but by August 1 was shifted into 32nd Army, part of the Reserve Front.  2nd Formation  The division was in 32nd Army of Reserve Front, east of Smolensk, on July 21 when the reformation officially began. Its order of battle became: * 376th Rifle Regiment * 653rd Rifle Regiment * 673rd Rifle Regiment * 660th Artillery Regiment * 381st Sapper BattalionSharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, 1996, p. 33 In August the 220th was moved to 49th Army, also in Reserve Front.

In May, 1942, the 220th went into Kalinin Front reserves to be rebuilt.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p 33  Battles for Rzhev  The division, now back in 31st Army, took part in the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation, fighting in the northeast outskirts of Rzhev itself in the late summer and autumn of 1942.Boris Gorbachevsky, Through the Maelstrom, A Red Army Soldier's War on the Eastern Front, 1942-1945, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2008, p 148 The 220th would remain in this Army for the duration,Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p 33 although it was briefly attached to 68th Army in September, 1943.Gorbachevsky, p 294 In a once-more weakened state the division held its positions on the left bank of the Volga through the winter. On Mar. 2 - 3, 1943 it joined in the liberation of Rzhev as the German Ninth Army withdrew from the salient (Operation B√ºffel). 31st Army pursued the German forces as best it could through the devastated territory and the spring rasputitsa, coming to a halt against a new German fortified line at the base of the former salient on Mar. 31. The new commander of the 220th, Col. V.A. Polevik, summarized the March battles: \\"The division coped with its assigned task. But the losses were significant.\\"Gorbachevsky, pp 255 - 60  Advance to Smolensk  From April to early August the 220th rested, replenished and fortified its positions in anticipation of a German summer offensive.Gorbachevsky, p 291 Following the German defeat at Kursk, Kalinin and Western Fronts prepared their own offensive through the Smolensk land bridge to liberate that city; the offensive began on Aug. 7. The operation was a long, grinding affair against thick German defenses, and the division contributed by helping to retake the towns of Spas-Demensk, Dukhovshchina, Iartsevo and Dorogobuzh; during this time the 220th was pulled back into second echelon for replenishment no less than four times. Finally, on Sept. 25, Smolensk was liberated.Gorbachevsky, pp 292 - 94 The slow advance continued by fits and starts through the autumn and winter along the Dnepr River. At this time the division was part of 45th Rifle Corps. By March, 1944, the division was so worn down that each rifle regiment had only two rifle battalions, and each battalion had only two rifle companies and a sub-machinegun platoon. This was just 40% of approved strength in infantry, but the 660th Artillery Reg't. was at full strength and was fully motorized with a mix of Lend-Lease and Soviet vehicles. During the final years of the war, the Red Army increasingly substituted firepower for manpower, and many rifle divisions fought effectively with these strengths.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p 33 Nevertheless, the 220th had its infantry component strengthened before the summer offensive.  Operation Bagration  At the outset of this operation on June 22, 1944, the division was in 36th Rifle Corps of 31st Army in Gen. I.D. Chernyakovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front. (As of June 1, 1944, it had been the sole division in the corps.) The 220th soon distinguished itself by taking a leading role in the liberation of Orsha; it later also assisted in the liberation of the Belorussian capital, Minsk, and received the names of both these cities as honorifics: At the end of July the division participated in the liberation of Grodno, near the border with Poland, and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 33 For his leadership during the fighting near Grodno, political officer Captain Kirill Koshman of the 376th Rifle Regiment was named a Hero of the Soviet Union.Gorbachevsky, p. 327  Advance into Germany  The 220th continued advancing into northern Poland, East Prussia and Pomerania with its Front during late 1944 and early 1945, but in April was shifted with 31st Army south to 1st Ukrainian Front, and then took part in the last Soviet offensive of the war, towards Prague from May 6‚Äì11. The division ended the war in the 44th Rifle Corps, rounding up fugitives of the defeated German Army Group Center east of Prague.

The wooden image of Christ, by unknown artist, in a Renaissance-style representation of the Ecce Homo, represents the episode of Jesus of Nazareth's life when the martyred religious figure was presented to the crowd following his whipping, and includes a crown of thorns, uncovered torso and bruised/beaten body. Narrated in the New Testament, the artist represented in grande artistic style the contrast between violence on the body and the serenity of the expression, emphasized by the gaze from the image. Normally, this statue and piece of art is on display in the Sanctuary of the Lord Holy Christ, in the Convent of Our Lady of Hope (in Ponta Delgada, on the island of S√£o Miguel in the Azores), but annually leads a procession through the streets of the city. The festivals in honour of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles occur on the fifth Sunday after Easter, the day on which a great procession winds the streets of the provincial capital, and terminating on the Thursday of Ascension. These events are the most and oldest religious devotions still carried out in Portugal, with the popular feasts at the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Mother, in Loul√©, and the 20th century celebrations in honour of Our Lady of F√°tima having comparable interest. Annually, the celebrations in Ponta Delgada attract thousands of Azoreans, Luso-descendants and peoples from the various islands of the archipelago to S√£o Miguel. History The Convent of Our Lady of Hope, in Ponta Delgada, Azores, is the sanctuary of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles. The exit of the image of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles from the Convent at the beginning of the annual procession. The foundations of this cult began in the formation of the Convent of Caloura, which was established by the two daughters of Jorge da Mota, a resident of Vila Franca do Campo, whom had sheltered in the small Vale de Caba√ßos.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.54 Documentation attributes Pope Paul III (1534-1549) with the gift of the image to the religious curia whom visited Rome in order to obtain a pontifical bull to authorize the foundation of the first convent on the island of S√£o Miguel. Yet, similar documents suggest the gift of the image of Christ was attributed to his predecessor, Pope Clement VII (1523-1534). Regardless, the image was placed in a niche, where it was maintained for a few years. Owing to the Convent of Caloura's position over a clifftop by the sea, it was susceptible to attacks by pirates and corsairs, then abundant in the waters of the archipelago at the time. Consequently, many of the sisters moved to the newer convents that became constituted in areas with more protection, including the Convent of Saint Andrew (in Vila Franca do Campo) and the Convent of Our Lady of Hope (in Ponta Delgada). It was in the latter that Mother In√™s de Santa Iria, a nun originating from Galicia, moved with the image of the \\"Ecce Homo\\" in 1541, where it remained. The Convent was founded by Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara and his wife Filipa Coutinho, who had stayed with a group of the sisters in Vale de Cabe√ßas after the 1522 Vila Franca earthquake. The devotion to the image and what it represented began in the 17th and 18th centuries, following the principles adopted by the Catholic Church, following the Council of Trent, in the defense of the cult and veneration of images, following the Protestant Reformation. The veneration of this image of Christ came at the impulse of Venerable Mother Teresa da Anunciada. The nun entered the Convent of Esperan√ßa in the 17th century, along with her biological sister Joana de Santo Ant√≥nio, both noble born and with strong personalities. Teresa da Anunciada was profoundly devout and, fed by her saintly character, inspired many to refer to her as \\"Mother\\", even as she was not a Reverend Mother Superior. From the moment of her entrance to the convent, Mother Teresa da Anunciada adopted an attitude of profound devotion to the image of the \\"Ecce Homo\\", building an intimate relationship and treating the image in honorifics, such as seu Senhor and seu Fidalgo. The two sisters were supported by the supposed miraculous character of the image. Joana de Santo Ant√≥nio, before being transferred to the Convent of Saint Andrew, alerted the locals to the miraculous character of one of the patterns that covered the visible breast of the image. Mother Teresa da Anunciada not only made efforts to exalt the image of the \\"Ecce Homo\\", but also called for religious vassalage and adherence in the name of Jesus Christ. Although impeded by the abadess of the convent, she was able to erect a chapel for the image and adorn it with regalia associated with a monarch. To this end, she accepted donations from numerous faithful from around the island, from the Kingdom and some from overseas. It was following the visit of Jos√© Rodrigo da C√¢mara and the Princess Rohan to the Convent in 1690, that the incremental leap associated with this veneration took form. Pedro II of Portugal, by regal decree dated 2 September 1700, conceded an annuity of 12,000 r√©is in order to maintain an olive oil lamp in front of the altar to Senhor Santo Cristo. The decorated facade of the Convent of Our Lady of Hope, the sanctuary of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles. The Campo de S√£o Francisco square following the traditional open-air mass. In 1700, the island of S√£o Miguel was rocked by tremors and earthquakes, which lasted several days. Influenced by the nun, the council of the Miseric√≥rdia and the nobles of the city, decided to take the image of Santo Cristo in procession from the Convent through the city. This they believe would temper God's response and curtail the unceasing tremors on the island. The sister organized and institutionalized many of the characteristic rituals of the annual procession, including the first appearance of confeitos (sugar candies) and the ceremonial traditions that have rigidly followed the celebration, with the support and collaboration of the local populous.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.55 This included the movements of the dolly from the lower choir to the altar, before exiting the Church and circling the Campo de S√£o Francisco: all choreographed by the Sister Anunciada. At the beginning of the afternoon, on 13 April 1700, the brotherhoods and religious communities gathered at the Convent, along with the nobles and crowd of faithful who believed that Divine intervention would occur at the appearance of the holy image. The date of this first procession is a point of controversy: the fisherman Urbano de Moendon√ßa Dias recorded it as 11 April 1700, while Luciano Mota Vieira suggested it was in the year 1698. Upon its appearance there was an outcry of emotion, tears and exaltation, in addition to testimonies of anguish from the faithful. Many of the poor followed the procession barefoot (owing to the poverty at the time), while the members of the nobility carried the statue in the direction of the Convent of Saint Andrew. This act was similar what to the Captain-Donat√°rio and his entourage did in the early years of the procession: the high nobility and members of authority, in their finest clothes, followed or participated in the movement of the image throughout the streets. In reality, the procession lead a circuitous route stopping at the convents along the route, with the choirs singing \\"Miserere mei Deus\\", stopping at: the Convent of Saint Francis (today the Church of Saint Joseph); Convent of Grace; Convent of Saint John (today the location of the Theatre Micalense); Convent of Saint Andrew (today the main Carlos Machado Museum); the Convent of the Jesuit College (the Church of the Jesuit College); and Convent of the Conception (today the Palace and Church of the Conception). It was the celebrations of 17 December 1713, when the procession assumed an unparalleled acclamation of its populous. Earthquakes had been plaguing the islands of the archipelago, affecting directly the lives of the peoples of Ginetes, Candel√°ria and Mosteiros: riverbeds erupted in sulphorous fumeroles and tremors plagued the islanders. The leaders of Ponta Delgada decided to bring the image out and complete a procession to the convents and churches wherein all the participants would be barefoot. Yet, on leaving the Church of the Jesuit College, in the direction of the Convent of Saint Andrew, the holy image (to the wonder and amazement of all) fell outside the grounds, and immediately all seismic activities ceased. This was seen as divine intervention; some supplicated themselves on the ground at the place that image fell, praying to God and asking for pity, others flagellating themselves, while others cried out their faults and begged God for His intersession. Meanwhile, there was little damage to the image (apart from observed damage on the right arm), and the image was washed and cleaned at the Convent of Saint Andrew. As the procession continued, the tears and sobs of the distressed faithful continued well into the night even as they returned to the Convent of Our Lady of Hope. Rituals The statue of Venerable Mother Teresa da Anunciada in front of the Convent of Our Lady of Hope. She was the person most dedicated to the Cult of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles. During these celebrations, the Brotherhood in conjunction with the sisters organize the illumination of the Convent of Our Lady of Hope and lighting of the Campo de S√£o Francisco. Locals and visitors to the region normally congregate in the square, by the lights of the fancifully decorated tower and Church facade of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa. On the Saturday proceeding the procession, many devotees present themselves to the image of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles and make promises to God, at many times on their knees travelling along Campo de S√£o Francisco. In the afternoon, the image is delivered by the sisters of the convent to the Brotherhood responsible for the celebrations. At this time, the image is moved to the altar of the Church of Our Lady of Hope, where it remains until Sunday. In reality, this tradition was altered, and for need of space, the image has been transferred to the nearby Church of Saint Joseph (across the Campo de S√£o Francisco from the Convent). Between Saturday and Sunday morning many faithful gather and stand watch in adoration of the image, with some traveling in pilgrimage to the Church from around the island. On the Sunday afternoon is the grand procession: the cortege runs through the principal arterial of the city, passing the churches and convents of the city.{{ =Procession= The flowered tapestry path leading from the Convent of Hope: the route of the procession is marked by the flower-laid mats. The first procession in honour of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles occurred through the initiative of Mother Teresa da Anunciada, with the support of the island population, following a series of earthquakes where the nun hoped to obtain divine intervention. To this end, the image was moved to the altar of the Convent, then left the Church and followed a route to the other churches and convents of Ponta Delgada. From documents of the period, at the appearance the image at the doors of Esperan√ßa there was a commotion from the gathered crowd and the earth tremors stopped. During the celebrations the crowd and image circles the Campo de S√£o Francisco and Convent of Our Lady of Hope (site of the sanctuary) in a profound devotion, faith and respect. In addition to the homage to the image of Christ, several faithful pay \\"promises\\" to God during these celebrations, usually involving exchanges for grants by God. Throughout most of the year, the image is guarded in the chapel/sanctuary of the Convent, located in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa, opposite the main altar, separated by glass and iron grade that runs through the Church's nave. Following the first procession, the tradition of running the streets of the city with the image has continued annually, with some interruptions due to rare meteorological circumstances. Sanctuary The return of the image of the Lord Holy Christ to the Convent of Our Lady of Hope.The illuminated Convent and Shrine of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles. Until the intervention of Mother Teresa da Anunciada, the image of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles was on display in a small altar below the lower choir. The nun succeeded in construction of a new altar for the image, that embodied the affinity of her veneration and devotion. In reality, though, the conditions were not adequate since the dust accumulated from the high-choir on to the image, and the floorboards were noisy, creating distractions during meditation. With this, the sister attempted to erect a more solemn, dignified chapel for the image, with the support of the population and donatives from the Crown. The primitive chapel today does not exist. This chapel was completed and consecrated on 5 March 1771, in a transitional Baroque-to-Rococo style. The entrance to this chapel, through the low choir is guarded by a series of azulejo ties, authored by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Bernardes, and dated to 1712, that represented the chapters in the birth (north) and passion of Christ (south). The interior of the chapel are azulejos executed by the Royal Factory of Rato () in Lisbon, from 1786 to 1787. =Treasure= The illuminated Campo de S√£o Francisco and tower of the Convent of Our Lady of Hope during the evenings prior to the procession date. The treasure of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles includes a group of jewellery and decorative pieces that adorn the image, including specifically the various capes that have been draped on the torso. Decorated with twine of gold and silver, and several precious stones, it represents one of the major treasures from the second half of the 18th century. The elements of this reliquary include donatives from faithful, nobles and members of the Portuguese crown, who have made promises to God, and reimbursed in kind. Many of these treasures came from the influence of Mother Teresa da Anunciada, who originally sought to ennoble the simple \\"Ecco Homem\\" image, her \\"master and noble\\". Many of the pieces were contributed long after her death (16 May 1738); Jos√© da C√¢mara and his wife Margarida Tom√°sia contributed the sceptre, the Crown of Thorns, the reliquary on the image's breast, rope and glitter that adorns the image as decoration, that included pearls, topaz, emeralds and other precious stones. The first sceptre, which was made of silk flowers, was originally ordered by Anunciada from the Mother Jer√≥nima do Sacramento in the Convent of Santo Andr√©. The various red capes, which drape the torso, are donations from local communities or from the immigrants in the Portuguese diaspora. Many believe that following their blessing, the capes offer a miraculous power to heal the sick. The first stretcher used to carry the image was richly decorated in flowers, was designed and decorated by Mother Teresa da Anunciada for the first procession. Few alterations have been made to this platform. The expansion of the cult around the world The image of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles in Vila do Porto, Santa Maria island. The cult and the devotion of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles of Ponta Delgada on S√£o Miguel island, quickly spread to the other islands of the Azores archipelago, having to that fact, above all, to the financial difficulties of the inhabitants of the other islands in it travel to Ponta Delgada to venerate the original image. Currently, the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles is devoted throughout the islands, and, after Ponta Delgada, the largest feasts and processions dedicated to him are those of Vila do Porto, on the Santa Maria and Graciosa islands. Hamilton, Bermuda islands. Due to the emigration of many Azoreans to the United States and Canada, particularly coming from the S√£o Miguel island, the worship and devotion to Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres was expanded and became by holding celebrations and processions in some cities in the Americas. Examples are the cities of Brampton, Cambridge, London, Kingston and Leamington in the province of Ontario, Canada, as well as in the capital itself, in Toronto; and the cities of Fall River and Cambridge, Massachusetts, among others in the state of Rhode Island in the United States. In Fall River was even built a parish church dedicated to the Holy Christ. In the city of Hamilton, on the Bermuda islands, is also held a solemn procession in honor of the Holy Christ of Miracles.

It is a folding table for portability, but when expanded stands about tall. The table top consists of two wooden jaws, one of which is fixed and the other able to be moved in and out on threaded rods operated by handles, so it can be used as a bench vice to hold wood, metal and other parts while working on them. The legs are designed to be strong enough to support the weight of a human so that it can be used as a stool to reach high surfaces, and has holes for retaining tools while working or for drilling. Its edges are printed with measures and angles, and although it cannot be used as a mitre saw the jaws are wide enough to hold one or take a mitre box. When invented, the designer Ron Hickman had difficulty convincing anyone to market the Workmate, and sold them himself at trade shows. He had his first breakthrough in 1968, after convincing a DIY magazine to let him exhibit at the Ideal Home Exhibition in London, which enabled him to sell 1,800 units that year. After seeing some success in 1971, Black & Decker decided to work with Hickman to improve his initial design and in 1972 Black & Decker's MKII version of the Workmate went into production. When released, it was first sold in the United Kingdom for ¬£24.95. Black & Decker had trouble keeping up with demand for the Workmate in the UK, but was still unconvinced of how well the Workmate would be accepted in the United States. As a test of demand, the UK-manufactured Workmate WM325 was introduced to the United States market in 1974 as the Model 79-001 Type E (\\"E\\" for England). U.S. consumers snapped them up, and Black & Decker began building Workmates for the North American market at their factory in Brockville, Ontario, Canada. The first Workmate produced in Canada and sold in the United States was designated the Model 79-001 Type 1. The 79-001 was produced until 1982, with frequent revisions, designated by Type numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Types E, and 1 through 5 used a pair of cast-aluminum pivoting H-frames to support the vise jaws and to allow the Workmate to fold for storage. The aluminum H-frame gave the Workmate a very distinctive appearance and was considered to be \\"Hickman's greatest aesthetic stroke.\\" By the Type 6, the aluminum H-frames were gone, replaced by ones of stamped steel. They have since sold thirty million Workmates. Ron Hickman received a royalty of about 50 pence (¬£0.50, sterling) for each Workmate sold, and became a wealthy man.

The man was found buried in a shallow grave behind an abandoned textile company near train tracks, and had died of homicide by beating. Investigators estimate he had been deceased since February of that year. His age could only be estimated that he was above 18 years old. He was estimated to be 6 feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. Eye and hair color could not be determined. He was found wearing a sleeveless navy vest jacket with a logo reading \\"American Valve & Hydrant\\" and \\"Beaumont, Texas 1997 Safety Award\\", as well as a long sleeve green sweatshirt with \\"Regions\\" written on the front, a pair of blue denim jeans, a dark leather belt with a simple silver metal buckle, crew length socks, a pair of dark plaid boxer shorts, and a wrist watch with a face that had two hands. He also was found with a pair of eyeglasses to correct far sightedness. The tipsters that called in the tip claimed that they were the assailants who had killed the man, and that they had disposed of the man's identification. They also claimed that the victim had ridden a train from Texas. = Elmore County Jane Doe = On July 22, 2007, the partial skeletal remains of a young possibly African American woman were found on private property in Titus, Alabama. The property owner claimed to have found the remains while gardening, and stated that he had seldom visited the property since 1991. The woman was found wrapped in a 6-by-8 foot green tarp, secured by rope. She was estimated to be between 30 and 40 years old, and was approximately 5 feet tall. She had long, dark brown hair. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. Evidence was found that lime had been poured around the body in order to mask the smell. = Opelika Jane Doe = left The skull of a girl of African heritage was discovered on January 28, 2012, in Opelika, Lee County, Alabama, concealed in the woods near a trailer park. Several other bones of this decedent were also subsequently recovered. Examiners concluded that she was between four and seven years old at the time of her death and had black hair. She is also presumed to have been \\"abused and malnourished\\" while alive and her death is presumed to be murder. Her height, weight and eye color could not be determined because of the advanced state of decomposition of her remains. The girl had likely died between 2011 and 2012. The victim has since been forensically reconstructed by the FBI Victims Identification Project and currently has her DNA being processed to compare to potential matches. In 2016, the facial features of Opelika Jane Doe were forensically reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Subsequently, the photographs of an unidentified child seen at a vacation bible school in 2011 were linked with her. The child seen alive appeared to be neglected and could have suffered abuse, as she had visible damage to one of her eyes.  Alaska  = \\"One-Eyed Jack\\" = Facial reconstruction of One-Eyed Jack. The decedent's mandible was not found; the jawline depicted is an estimation. On August 20, 1979, the skeletal remains of a man were discovered in Tok, Alaska. The decedent had apparently hitchhiked to Alaska in 1978 with another man and was then murdered by his companion. He was 6 feet tall, weighed approximately 185 pounds, and was less than 40 years old when he was murdered. The man's left eye was missing, and he wore a distinctive leather eye patch, which may play a crucial role in his future identification. Another feature pertaining to his identity is that he had long brown hair worn with a headband. = \\"Eklutna Annie\\" = Eklutna Annie is a young white female (with possible Native American heritage) whose body was discovered on July 21, 1980, in Eklutna, Anchorage, Alaska. This decedent is believed to have been in her late teens or early twenties at the time of her murder. Serial killer Robert Hansen confessed to murdering this woman, claiming she was either a prostitute or a dancer whom he stabbed in the back as she attempted to escape from his vehicle in late 1979. = \\"Horseshoe Harriet\\" = The remains of a woman were found on April 25, 1984, near Horseshoe Lake in Palmer, Alaska. She had been stabbed and shot. Like Eklutna Annie, she is believed to have been a victim of serial killer Robert Hansen; Hansen led police to her body. \\"Horseshoe Harriet\\" was between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall. She was most likely between the ages of 19 and 20 when she was murdered. Along with her remains were found a scarf, coat, brassiere, tennis shoes, a sweater, jeans, socks, and leg warmers. Other items found were cigarettes, a comb, a compact, and condoms. Her remains were exhumed in 2014 for additional forensic examination.  Arizona   Arkansas  = White County John Doe = On April 20, 1989, the decomposing remains of a white male were discovered under a bridge in a deserted, rural area in Beebe, Arkansas. Cause of death was found to be multiple gunshots from a small caliber firearm. He was estimated to be between 18 and 60 years old, was 6 feet tall and weighed 226 pounds.He had brown hair and brown eyes, as well as a beard. He was also described as having a stocky build. He was found wearing a red T-shirt, 'Dickeys' brand slacks, and white socks. Investigators believe that he may have been murdered elsewhere and dumped in the desolate area and may not have been native to the area. It is also believed that it is possible that the man may not even be native to the United States. = Benton County Jane Doe = On May 7, 1990, several bones were discovered near State Route 102 near the Missouri state line, eight miles west of Decatur, Arkansas. They belonged to a young white female, who appeared to have suffered a gunshot wound to the head, as multiple buckshot pellets were found under the skull. The remains had been extensively run over with a vehicle as well as burned, trying to make identification impossible, however DNA was able to be taken. The woman was between 25 and 35 years old, and was 5 feet 5 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. The only items of clothing able to be recovered were just small scraps of women's clothing, after they had been burned. A neighbor stated that he had seen a fire burning in the area where the woman was found in February that year, but did not investigate as they assumed it was just a neighbor burning trash. =El Dorado Jane Doe= A woman estimated to be anywhere between 18 and 30 years of age was found deceased on July 10, 1991, in El Dorado, Arkansas in Room 121 of the Whitehall Motel. The decedent is known to have used multiple names, including Cheryl Ann Wick (which she used from a stolen identification card), Kelly Carr/Karr, Shannon Wiley, and Mercedes. She was known to have lived in various states prior to her death, including Texas, where she apparently worked as a sex worker. Other reports explain she had been arrested in the past, using several of her aliases and had possibly been involved in a bank robbery on the East Coast. She had been shot to death by her boyfriend who was convicted of her murder, although the woman remains unidentified. A second cousin of the victim living in Alabama was identified by a genealogist using genetic genealogy after uploading the unidentified woman's autosomal DNA to the GEDmatch database. The cousin did not recognize the victim but stated she resembled members of the family. = Benton County John Doe = The decomposed remains of a man were discovered in the Beaver Lake in Rogers, Benton County, Arkansas on October 16, 1996. His body was concealed in a sleeping bag which had floated to the surface, possibly after breaking loose from whatever tethers may have been weighing his body beneath water. He was a white male aged between 30 and 60 years old, standing at five feet nine inches to five feet eleven inches tall, with a case of myositis ossificans on one of his arms. He may have been subjected to heavy labor in life, possibly being a logger or a weight lifter. His teeth had been stained, perhaps from coffee or tobacco use. He had at least one tooth removed along with having one filling; his front teeth showed a large amount of wear. He had suffered a blow to the forehead with a blunt instrument, and had died as early as 1995. Along with the sleeping bag, two pillows were found that belonged to a medical center and the deteriorated remnants of boxer shorts and one sock were worn by the decedent. = Pulaski County Jane Doe (2002) = The skeleton of a black woman between 18 and 40 years of age was discovered in Little Rock, Pulaski County, Arkansas on August 18, 2002. She had been shot in the head and was hidden underneath a pile of insulation. She wore several articles of clothing, some of which were designed for men. Several pennies and a dollar bill were found in the pockets of her shirt and windbreaker pants. Her nose had been broken and her septum was reportedly slanted to the left side. Multiple ribs had previously healed from fractures.  California   Colorado  = Gilpin County Jane Doe = The charred body of a woman was found on September 30, 1952, in a forest near Colorado State Highway 119 in Black Hawk, Gilpin County, Colorado. The victim had been placed under a log that was set afire after being doused with an accelerant approximately 20 to 30 days before her remains were found. The victim was believed to be aged between 25 and 30 years old at the time of her murder (born between 1922 and 1927), although she may have been as young as 17. Her hair, which was found attached to the skull, is believed to have been dark in color, and she was approximately five feet seven inches tall. Because of the condition of her body, her weight and race are unknown, as her remains had deteriorated to the point that they weighed 14 pounds. One of her legs was severed from her body, which may have been due to animal activity. The victim had an overbite, which has been described as fairly noticeable. Jewelry found at the scene included a necklace with rhinestones and three earrings. Burned clothing was also found; a light blue sequin top, jeans and a shoe were all recovered, but were fragmented. A lipstick container, an electric razor, a purse, and a man's ring were also at the scene. She was believed to have been hit on the head with a bloody stick nearby before being burned, although it is not known if she was killed after the blow. The stick and one of the earrings were later found by a woman who visited the scene after hearing about the case. The individual who discovered these remains, Charles Damoth, was initially believed by authorities to be the killer, although his daughter believes otherwise. At least five others were ruled out as possible perpetrators. Damoth admitted to finding her body days before reporting the killing, which some have found suspicious. He claimed he also had cut wood in the area, including the log found on her body. One person also stated they had seen Damoth's truck near the scene around the time the victim was estimated to have died. Polygraph tests used on the suspect never revealed additional evidence. This murder is also referred to as the \\"Pyre Case,\\" and the victim has also been nicknamed \\"Maria.\\" = Morrison John Doe = On February 13, 1977, the mummified remains of a young, possibly Native American male were discovered in a military sleeping bag near US Route 285 in Morrison, Colorado. He had been killed by blunt force trauma to the head and had been dead for anywhere between one to two months. He was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old, was approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed between 125 and 145 pounds. He had medium dark brown or black hair. Investigators found a witness that stated a man had come door to door at the nearby Twin Forks Motel in Tiny Town. The man was asking to use a phone in order to catch a ride to Littleton, and when he was able to use one, he dialed a number but did not reach anybody. He claimed he had been in a fight with his brother while travelling and was forced to get out of the car, where he kicked out the windshield of the car after. He also only had a shirt and pants on during a very cold night as well as various, small, bleeding cuts on his face. It is unknown whether this incident has any relation to the man found in Morrison. = El Paso County John Doe = The skeleton of a male was found on November 3, 1986, a year or less after his death. This five feet five inches in height, 35 to 40-year-old male had been shot and his body also revealed evidence of his having received blunt-force trauma to his face. The remains were located in a field in El Paso County, Colorado. He had brown hair and was wearing a blue-green sweatshirt along with a pair of jeans. = Baca County Jane Doe = On June 3, 1988, the skeletal remains of a young Hispanic/Native American female were discovered in an open field in rural Baca County, Colorado, southwest of Springfield, Colorado. Cause of death could not be determined, but investigators are treating the case as a homicide. The woman was between the ages of 19 and 24 years old, was between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 4 inches tall, and weighed 130 pounds. She had brown hair and had likely not given birth during her life. She was found wearing gray corduroy Levi brand pants, a beige winter coat with a synthetic fur collar and a bra. Her skeleton had been bleached by the sun. Investigators believe that the woman had died approximately a year prior. The area she was found in was near some rural roads frequented by truckers to avoid the port. FBI Reconstruction of Windy Point Jane Doe = Windy Point Jane Doe = On July 7, 1994, the skeletal remains of a young-middle aged white female were discovered by a group of hikers near the Smokehouse Campground off of US Forest Service Route 402 in Montrose County, Colorado. The area in which she was found in is commonly referred to as \\"Windy Point\\". Cause of death was undetermined but ruled to be a homicide. She had been dead for approximately 18 months. She was estimated to be between 35 and 40 years old, and was 5 feet 4 inches tall. She had reddish brown hair and suffered from both temporomandibular joint syndrome and scoliosis. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. The skull was initially brought to authorities, after which they conducted a search of the Windy Point area and found more remains. Her skeleton had sustained damage from scavenging animals after being deposited at the location. Investigators believe she was most likely killed elsewhere before being brought to the location and concealed. = Weld County John Doe = On August 12, 1995, the skeletal remains of a young male of indeterminate race were found by an oil field worker when he found one of the man's shoes sticking up from the ground. The man had died of a gunshot and a possible stabbing, and had been dead for at least a year. He was between 20 and 25 years old and 5 feet 6 inches tall. He had dark brown hair and appeared to be right handed. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. He was found wearing a pair of 'Spalding' brand high-top sneakers, black Wrangler pants, a shirt, and white Fruit of the Loom briefs. He was found when one of the workers at an oil field in the area found his sneaker sticking out of the ground in a hidden grave. The grave was dug in very hard ground which led investigators to believe that more than one person was involved in his death. Pieces of cigarette butts were also found near the grave, leading investigators to believe that one of the men who killed the Doe possibly smoked. = Adams County John Doe = On July 14, 2001, the head of a middle aged white/Hispanic man was found in Little Dry Creek in a local fishing pond, in Brighton, Colorado. Additional remains were discovered later on the 21st, including both legs from the calf down. They were discovered in a field when the right foot was protruding from the ground. DNA testing later linked the body parts to the same man. The body was described as having been mechanically dismembered. He was estimated to be between 30 and 50 years old and was between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 8 inches tall. He had dark brown hair and eyes, as well as a goatee and a healing fracture on his nose. =Saguache County John Doe= The body of a male was discovered on October 12, 2002, in Saguache, Saguache County, Colorado. He had been shot in the head twice at a minimal distance and left in a ravine. He had been wrapped in a handmade, antique quilt, and wrapped again in black plastic secured with duct tape. He is believed to have been asleep when killed. The victim was six feet five inches tall and was estimated to weigh between 235 and 240 pounds. Although he was toothless, no dentures were found at the scene of his discovery. He was estimated to have been between the ages of 30 and 40. He wore a motorcycle jacket with the words \\"Fort Washington, Maryland\\" and black shorts. It is possible that he was attending a motorcycle-related gathering at the time of his death.  Connecticut  = New Haven County John Doe (1923) = On August 9, 1923, the badly decomposed remains of an unknown male were found on Milford Townpike in West Haven near the New Haven County Home. This John Doe was estimated to be approximately 27 years old, had brown hair and stood at 5 feet 7 inches. He weighed approximately 150 pounds. The decedent wore a brown striped suit and under one arm had a chauffeur's cap. He had a cloth gag in his mouth and there appeared to be two bullet wounds in his chest, but he was apparently killed by strangulation. This individual was possibly killed by serial killer Carl Panzram. He was one of the few victims of Panzram that can be confirmed. It is alleged that the victim may have been approximately 16 years old and either the nephew or son of a New York Policeman. = \\"Lorraine Stahl\\" = On May 30, 1974, the nearly skeletal remains of a young white female were found wrapped in a blanket in a wooded area in Stonington, Connecticut. Cause of death was undetermined, however investigators believe she was killed through homicidal means. She was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old and was 5 feet 2 inches tall. She had brown or auburn hair. Weight and eye color could not be determined due to decomposition. She was found wearing a tan leather vest, a gold/tan sweater, a brown tweed skirt, a pair of brown boots, a yellow raincoat, and a class-like ring with the letters \\"JNHS/JHNS\\" and the initials \\"ILN\\" on the side. Witnesses had seen her driving a green 1964 Oldsmobile with Massachusetts or Miami plates. She was also known to be in the company of a bank robber by the name of Gustavous Lee Carmichael. A telephone list was found with her remains. Calls were made to Nashville, Tennessee, various cities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Wilmington, Delaware, and Buffalo, New York as well as New York City. Investigators believe that they may have found relatives in Tennessee, West Virginia, or the Carolinas. = New Haven County Jane Doe = Composite of the New Haven County Jane Doe On August 16, 1975, the body of a white female between 18 and 28 years of age was discovered in East Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut. The victim was bound and gagged, nude, and floating in a drainage ditch behind a building. This woman was killed by strangulation at least five days prior to her discovery, although her face was recognizable. Antenna wires were visible around her neck, waist and legs and her body was wrapped in a tarp, which had been secured with an electrical cord. It is believed that the decedent was not murdered at the location where her body was discovered. The victim was around five feet six inches in height and weighed approximately 125 pounds. She had dark brown hair and either hazel or brown eyes. She may have undergone rhinoplasty. This may be a contributing factor for this woman remaining unidentified, as those who knew her in life before this possible surgery would be less likely to recognize the constructed facial composite released to the public. This decedent may also have worn braces at one point in her life and had both ears pierced; she wore silver-colored earrings. No evidence of her murderer was left behind, save for white spots of paint discovered on the tarp used to conceal her body. Her murder could possibly be linked to that of a man who was murdered and disposed of in a similar manner, as well as serial killings in the area. She is buried in an unmarked grave in the State Street Cemetery in Hamden, Connecticut. 2018 FBI Reconstruction of New Britain Jane Doe = New Britain Jane Doe = On October 11, 1991, the decomposed remains of a young White/Hispanic female were found near railroad tracks behind the now defunct \\"Fafnir Bearing Company\\" in New Britain, Connecticut. She had been shot in the head and had been dead for anywhere between three weeks to four months. She was estimated to be between 23 and 35 years old, was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 130 to 135 pounds. She had straight black hair. Eye color could not be ascertained. She was found wearing a white sleeveless sun dress, a shirt with a group of pandas printed on it, one holding a red umbrella, one holding a yellow heart, one holding an ice cream cone and two more holding each other. She was buried in 2003 but then exhumed in 2011 by the FBI to make a forensic reconstruction, which was then updated in 2018. The DNA Doe Project began investigating her case in February, 2019. The Project later released an update on their Facebook page, stating that she had significant ancestral ties to New York, Connecticut, and Puerto Rico. They also included a list of potential surnames of family members. = New Haven County John Doe (1992) = On August 21, 1992, the mostly skeletal remains of a young Asian-American man were discovered in the woods near a railroad line in Milford, Connecticut. He had been shot multiple times in the head and wrapped in a pink blanket, olive blanket, and two garbage bags. He was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old, was approximately 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed between 120 and 130 pounds. He had medium length, straight, black hair. His teeth were in good, natural condition. He was found wearing a long sleeve button-down shirt with the logo \\"Forever\\" on it, a Fruit of the Loom undershirt, a pair of denim pants, a brown belt with a yellow buckle, and a pair of Fruit of the Loom underwear. Four small caliber bullets were recovered at the crime scene, and it appeared he had been deposited there. He was also most likely not from the area.  Delaware  = New Castle County Jane Doe = 196x196px A possible victim of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas was found in a field in Townsend, New Castle County, Delaware on June 27, 1977. Examination of the bones concluded that she was a middle aged woman, the mother of approximately two children and had various dental problems, as well as a spinal condition, at the age of thirty-three to sixty- three. Her dental problems may have been due to smoking, as a large amount of tar was found in her mouth, which also had a removable plate and many fillings. Despite the various types of dental work, the quality of the procedures was of fairly low quality. One of the bones of one of her right fingers was broken, possibly from defending herself from the killer. She may have been native to Michigan, which has led investigators to believe that Lucas had been involved, as he had given statements in prison describing a similar crime scene as well as claiming he had murdered a Michigan woman in the same area. The woman's DNA profile was analyzed by the Parabon NanoLabs in 2018. Traits such as blue eyes, a fair complexion and Northern European ancestry were suggested by their examination. A computer generated image was also produced, depicting an approximation of the woman at age 48. FBI Reconstruction of Wilmington John Doe = Wilmington John Doe (1993) = On September 13, 1993, the decomposing remains of a young Asian American or Native American man were discovered in a wooded area on the side of a local road near Interstate 95 in Wilmington, Delaware. Cause of death could not be ascertained, however it is believed he was killed through homicidal means, as he was found blindfolded and bound. He was estimated to have been dead for about two weeks. He was estimated to be between 20 and 40 years old, was between 5 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 11 inches tall, and weighed between 120 and 140 pounds. He had medium length, black, straight hair, and dark brown eyes. He also had evidence of a possible neck injury in the past as well as an extra long pinkie fingernail. Part of his right middle finger was also missing, however this was well healed and was most likely amputated during life. His dental records suggested that he may have smoked or chewed tobacco in life. He was found wearing a light colored Ralph Lauren brand polo jacket, a short sleeved T shirt, a pair of tan Bugle Boy pants, white boxer shorts and a pair of leather shoes. Three unspent .38 caliber bullets wrapped in tissue paper were found in his pocket. The man's fingerprints were sent to national databases, and many missing persons reports were compared, however they yielded no leads to the man's identity. = Odessa Jane Doe = dental care in her lifetime.|alt=|left The skeleton of a woman aged between 20 and 35 (although this decedent may have been up to 45 years in age) was found on November 25, 1993, in Odessa, New Castle County, Delaware. Her body had been left in the William J. Baxter Memorial Park, approximately three months before it was found. She had very healthy teeth that showed no signs of staining, although there was evidence of some crowding at the back of her mouth. This decedent was white with a possible Hispanic ethnicity, approximately five feet one to five feet two inches tall, but because of the state of the remains, the weight was not possible to estimate. Her hair was a dark brown. After examining the pelvis, it was concluded that she may have given birth at one time. The cause of her death was not apparent, but is believed to have been foul play. Most of the bones from the digits of her hands and feet were not found, along with two other types of bones. No clothing was found at the site and thirteen people have been excluded as possibly identities of the victim. = Kent County Jane Doe = On July 20, 1997, the skeleton of a brown-haired woman was found by a hiker in an area hidden by trees in Camden, Kent County, Delaware, near the border of Maryland. It is believed that the woman had been killed by blows to the head, as damage to her skull suggested. She was of middle age, between forty and sixty. The victim was white, between five feet three to five feet eight inches tall and weighed approximately 120 pounds. The victim had likely broken her wrist at one point during her life, which had happened long before she died. Other bones also showed evidence of previous injury and her knees also indicated she could have suffered from arthritis. She wore a denture on the top of her mouth; one of the eyeteeth were missing. The victim was found wearing nothing but a blue hair clip and a watch. Due to injuries that occurred before death, the way the woman walked may have been affected by damage to the bones in one of the legs. Her body was at the scene for three months to two years. = New Castle County John Doe = New Castle County John Doe On October 17, 1994, a Hispanic man's body was found in New Castle County, Delaware, near a wooded area next to a road. The cause of his death was not apparent, but because his body was concealed in a sheet, authorities presume he was murdered. The body was discovered by a truck driver who noticed a screw and a glove on the side of the road and then inspected a suspicious bundle nearby. He was 138 pounds and five feet five inches tall at the estimated age range of twenty-five to thirty-five years of age. The man was described as being \\"well groomed\\" and had neat dark hair and a mustache and manicured nails and healthy teeth. He had a large amount of body hair, which was shaved under the arms and in the pubic region. It is believed that he was of Central-American descent. He wore a grayish shirt, large dark shorts underneath khakis with a brown belt, white socks, underwear and no shoes. He carried fifteen single dollars along with a nickel, which were created across the United States.  Florida   Georgia  = Cobb County Jane Doe = On May 10, 1984, the skeletal remains of a young white female were discovered on a rural road near the Chattahoochee River in Cobb County, Georgia. Cause of death was not determined, but investigators believe she was killed through homicidal means and then dumped at the location. She was estimated to be between 18 and 25 years old, was between 5 feet and 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed between 105 and 115 pounds. Hair and eye color were not ascertained, however she was found wearing a reddish wig. She had reconstructive surgery on her right eye, and a metal pin and plate on her left ankle, suggesting she had to wear a special shoe. She was found covered with a brown corduroy jacket with the name \\"George\\" on it. She was wearing a pair of western boots with fleece lining, a short sleeve pullover shirt with a playboy bunny, a western styled long sleeve blouse and a pair of blue jeans.Investigators initially believed she was a prostitute. = Fulton County Jane Doe = The Fulton County Jane Doe is known for her tattoo of the word \\"Jesus'\\" on her hand. On January 13, 1988, in Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia, a woman between thirty and forty was discovered alive, after suffering an injury to the head, which was believed to have been committed by another person within hours of her discovery. She lived for five additional days until she died at a local hospital. She had the word \\"Jesus'\\" tattooed to her right hand. She was between five feet and five feet two inches and weighed 105 pounds. The victim had strawberry blond hair that was nearly one foot long and green eyes. Three scars were found on her abdomen, possibly from surgery, and another was found on her right arm. She had received some dental care, as gold crowns were found on two of her molars.

The body was concealed by plastic, which was then duct taped and placed inside of a duffel bag. The victim had died of asphyxiation, and her body was not discovered until between four and seven days after her death. Examiners concluded the decedent was between five feet five and five feet six inches in height; she weighed between 135 and 140 pounds and had long brown hair. In addition to having visibly crooked teeth, she had her left wisdom tooth missing, although all her teeth were apparently well-cared for. In addition, one of her molars had been removed shortly before she was murdered. The age range of the Jenkins County Jane Doe at the time of her death is determined to have been between 16 and 25. Along with her body, some bedding material was also found. = Rising Fawn Jane Doe = The Rising Fawn Jane Doe is the name given to a Caucasian girl (also known as Pamela Doe) between sixteen and twenty-five whose remains were discovered in Rising Fawn, Dade County, Georgia, on December 16, 1988, near the state border with Alabama.

She may have been a runaway or a hitchhiker. = Glynn County Jane Doe = On August 16, 1990, the skeletal remains of a young African American female were discovered in the woods near a rural road near Interstate 95 in Glynn County, Georgia. Cause of death could not be ascertained, but investigators believe she was killed by homicidal means. She had been deceased for anywhere between one to two months. She was between 18 and 25 years old, was approximately 5 feet 3 inches tall, and weighed between 110 and 115 pounds. She had black hair and had most likely given birth sometime during her life.

He had a plastic bag over his head and was bound to a tree. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old, was 5 feet 7 inches tall, and approximately 140 pounds. His teeth were natural and in good condition, and his lower jaw was not symmetrical. He was found wearing a plaid, long-sleeved shirt, a pair of khaki shorts, a brown, woven, leather belt, a blue jacket, blue boxers, a pair of Timberland hiking boots, and a pair of gold prescription bifocal glasses. No identification was found with the remains, and investigators could not locate any nearby abandoned vehicles. = Fulton County John Doe (2001) = On November 24, 2001, the charred remains of a young male were discovered in a wooded area between Harbor Point Parkway and Morgan Falls Dam in Sandy Springs, Georgia. He had been stabbed multiple times in the neck and then set ablaze. He was estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old, was 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 140 pounds. He had dark brown/black hair and brown eyes, as well as a full beard and mustache. The only clothes found on the remains were a charred pair of boxer shorts. Investigators believe he was killed elsewhere and then deposited at the location. = \\"Kid\\" = On October 6, 2002, the body of a young Hispanic man was found in an abandoned building in Atlanta, Georgia, by a construction subcontractor. He had been shot to death. He was estimated to be between 18 and 25 years old, was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 136 pounds. He had medium length black hair and brown eyes, as well as a mustache and patchy beard. He was found wearing a green Gap brand T-shirt and a pair of blue Abercrombie & Fitch cargo shorts. He had been hired on as a night security guard for the building, and went by the nickname \\"Kid\\". He was also staying in one of the apartments of the building, and it appeared that the door had been forced open. = Polk County Jane Doe = On September 16, 2003, the charred remains of a young Hispanic female were found by firefighters in a residence in Cedartown, Georgia after an explosion. The fire was only contained to one bedroom, where firefighters found the victim as well as two males. She had been shot in the mouth and her hands had been duct taped, indicating a homicide. She was estimated to be between 15 and 25 years old, was approximately 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 101 pounds. She had straight black hair, pierced ears and a petite build. = Troup County Jane Doe = On December 6, 2007, a group of black trash bags were found at a rural intersection in Hogansville, Georgia. Upon closer inspection, the bags contained the remains of an African American woman, cut into eight pieces and missing her head, hands, and feet. Gasoline had been poured over the trash bags in an attempt to burn them, but the cool air of the night appeared to have doused the fire quickly. The woman was estimated to be between 21 and 31 years old, and between 4 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be determined.  Idaho  = Snake River John Doe = The body of a white male was discovered in the Snake River, near Lewiston, Nez Perce County, Idaho on July 26, 1982, after his death, which was two to three weeks prior. The Doe Network gives a longer estimated time of death to have been as early as January 1982. He was killed by two gunshots from a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson gun, which was not built since 1967. The wounds were to both the neck and shoulder of the man, who was between eighteen and twenty, although the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System reports that his age was not possible to estimate, increasing his age range to ninety-nine years old. The Nez Perce County sheriff department also gives conflicting information, describing him to be as young as thirteen to twenty. Despite that he may have been deceased for seven months, a scar was found on one of his ankles. However, no tattoos, jewelry or distinct birthmarks could be found. He was believed to be white, but may have been Hispanic, as his hair, which was several inches long, was black or red. His height and weight were estimated to be five feet eleven inches and 145 to 160 pounds, respectively. No dental care was observable in his mouth, as his teeth had been excellently cared for with no cavities. The young man wore jeans, blue, red and white striped swimwear in an American flag design and a white sock with the same colors. His case was reopened by police in 2012. = Oneida County Jane Doe = On October 26, 1986, a partial skull was found in Two Mile Canyon in Malad, Idaho. It appeared that the owner of the skull had suffered repeated blunt force trauma. Very little information of the decedent could be determined from the remains, but it has been inferred that the skull came from a female, either African American or African American with white admixture. Her estimated age was believed to be between 12 and 16 years old, but she may have been older than 20. Her skull was initially lost when being sent to a lab for DNA processing, however it resurfaced in 2018 and was sent to the FBI for analysis. Authorities believe that the case may be related to the killings of two other females, Tina Anderson (12) and Patricia Campbell (15), whose remains were discovered close by. Anderson was identified in 1981 and Campbell was identified in 2007. Both girls had been shot to death. The scene where the remains were found were re-excavated in 2007, which uncovered evidence which may link a potential group of suspects to the crime. There is also a possibility that the case is related to the killings of Linda Smith and Cindy Bringhurst, whose remains were discovered in the outskirts of Malad.  Illinois  = John Wayne Gacy victims = Six young males out of 33 known victims who were murdered between 1972 and 1978 by serial killer John Wayne Gacy remain unidentified. Their skeletonized bodies were discovered buried on Gacy's property between December 26, 1978, and March 9, 1979. Due to the advanced state of decomposition, in most instances, the causes of death of the victims could not be discovered (although the vast majority of Gacy's victims were killed by strangulation or asphyxiation). Four of these victims are estimated to have been aged between 14 and 24 years old, whereas two victims are estimated to have been aged between 22 and 32. All of these decedents were Caucasian, and at least four of these victims were murdered in 1976 or 1977, whereas two victims may have been murdered between 1972 and 1975. = Grundy County Jane Doe = On October 2, 1976, the body of a young African American woman was found on the side of US Route 6 near the LaSalle County line in Erienna Township, Illinois. She had been shot once in the back of the head with a .38 caliber revolver. She was estimated to be between 15 and 27 years old, was approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall, and weighed between 130 and 150 pounds. She had black hair and brown eyes. She also had a scar on her right hip and one on her lower right abdomen, which may have been a birthmark. The only item of clothing found was a red, black, and white sweater which had been wrapped around her head. She also had a green plastic bag wrapped around her head with black electrical tape. A reconstruction was made and distributed with the Chicago Daily Bulletin newspaper and her fingerprints were sent to various national crime labs for leads, all of which came up with nothing of value. In May, 2019, her case was taken on by the DNA Doe Project. In November 2019, it was announced that they had found a set of grandparents related to the decedent in Selma, Alabama, with the possible last name Calhoun, and a great grandparent with the possible name of Harris. They say that her family may be split between there and Dallas and Wilcox counties in Alabama, as well as a branch of her family in Ohio. She may have siblings who were unaware of her existence. = Madison County Jane Doe (1990) = On July 20, 1996, the decomposing remains of a young white female were discovered in a bean field in Jarvis Township, Illinois. She had been stabbed multiple times in the neck and torso and had been placed at the scene between two to three days before being discovered. She was estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old, was approximately 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed approximately 130 pounds. She was found wearing a pink \\"Gelmart\\" brand T-shirt with \\"Florida' written on it as well as some blue palm trees, a pair of white \\"Pebble Beach\\" brand sandals, and a silver ring with a heart shaped turquoise stone. She also had an upper denture plate. Investigators could find no sign of defensive wounds on the victim. She was also believed to have been sexually assaulted, before having her genitalia removed. FBI Reconstruction of LaSalle County Jane Doe = LaSalle County Jane Doe = On September 13, 1991, the mummified remains of a middle-aged white woman were found while a farmer was harvesting a cornfield in LaSalle County, Illinois. The woman had died from an acute cocaine overdose, but investigators have not ruled out that it may have been homicidal in nature, as three times the amount of a lethal dose of cocaine was found in her system. She was estimated to be between 35 and 50 years old, was approximately 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 120 pounds. Hair color and eye color could not be ascertained. She was found to be right handed, had breast implants, and had two tattoos: one of a cross with a red flower on her upper left breast, and one of a star shaped flower with a multicolored flower and stem on her lower right abdomen. She was found wearing a pair of black spandex shorts, and a pair of men's American Outfitter brand, striped, button down shirt with a dark pin stripe on a light background. A curtain was found underneath her remains. Isotope testing determined that she possibly originated from the upper-Midwest, Pacific Northwest, British Columbia, Alaska, or Canada. = Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park Jane Doe = On January 27, 1993, the severed head of a woman, aged thirty to fifty was discovered in the Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park in Ina, Jefferson County, Illinois. The woman's head may have been thrown from a vehicle, as her head was discovered hanging in brush, close to a road. Because no other parts of her body were found, the height and weight were impossible to determine. Examination of the skull suggested she suffered from wry neck syndrome, which would have caused her head to be in an awkward position when she was alive. This deformity may have been caused from previous trauma, possibly from a car accident. Her hair was a reddish-brown color. = Chicago Jane Doe (2000) = On March 22, 2000, an employee of the Waste Management Recycling Plant in Chicago, Illinois discovered the leg of a young/middle aged African American/Hispanic female sticking out of a plastic garbage bag. No further remains were recovered. She was estimated to be between 18 and 48 years old, and was 5 feet 6 inches tall. No other information could be ascertained. The leg did test positive for Benzoylecgonine, ethanol, and cocaine in a toxicology test. A high heel was recovered nearby, but it is unclear if it was related to the crime. The leg had been amputated from the hip, and the amputation appeared clean. Ligature marks were present on both sections of the leg and a twine which appeared to be used as a tourniquet was present. Investigators noted that the amputation appeared to have been carried out by someone skilled with basic anatomical knowledge. = Mascoutah Jane Doe = On January 30, 2002, the skeletal remains of a young, African American female were discovered near Interstate 64 by ILDOT workers in Mascoutah, Illinois. Cause of death was not stated, however she is believed to be a victim of serial killer Maury Troy Travis, based upon the circumstances of her discovery. She was estimated to be between 20 and 30 years old. Most other details are unknown. She was found wearing a one-piece black, sleeveless jumpsuit and two rings, one 14 karat gold and one costume-style. She was believed to have been deceased for several months. Investigators believe that Travis had sexually assaulted and tortured the victim before killing her, possibly videotaping it. = Monroe County Jane Doe (2002) = On March 28, 2002, the skeletal remains of a middle aged African American female were found by a group of ILDOT workers in a creek bed near State Route 3 in Columbia, Illinois. Cause of death could not be determined, but is being investigated as a homicide based upon the circumstances. She was estimated to be between 29 and 50 years old, was between 4 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 4 inches tall, and weighed 105 pounds. She was found wearing a green shirt with a large 'M' in orange, and the word 'Mavericks' in orange/yellow writing across the front. The shirt appeared to be a softball jersey or something similar. A pair of khaki colored shorts were also found nearby. She may possibly be a victim of serial killer Maury Troy Travis. Investigators believe that she may have been from St. Louis. The jersey found on the woman appeared to be similar to ones worn by a \\"Mavericks\\" softball team, however it was much too large and did not match the uniforms. Investigators believe that it might have come from a thrift store. = Madison County Jane Doe (2002) = On March 11, 2002, yet another group of ILDOT workers discovered the skeletal remains of a young, African American female near Interstate 70 in Marine, Illinois. She is the third possible unidentified victim of Maury Troy Travis. She had been deceased for about six months. SHe was estimated to be between 23 and 30 years old and was between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 6 inches tall. She had black hair. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. She was found wearing gray shorts with rhinestones, a red and white colored flannel button down shirt, a \\"gold\\" nugget styled ring and two bracelets. The first bracelet was a metal hoop, with a ring of onyx beads on an elastic string fitting it. The second was a combination of three bracelets strung together with an elastic string. She was believed to have been raped, tortured, and killed by Travis while he possibly videotaped it. Cook County Jane Doe (2005) = Cook County Jane Doe (2005) = In Chicago, Illinois, the skeleton of a female twelve to eighteen years old was located on April 28, 2005. She had been found near a railroad and had died several years earlier, possibly up to eight years prior. Because of the condition of her remains, hair color and weight could not be estimated. Cause of death was eventually found to be strangulation. The female's height was possible to be determined, however, and was subsequently placed between five feet and five feet five inches (152‚Äì165 cm). Some teeth were not found in the skull, but no evidence of dental work was noted. Examination of the bones indicated she was white with possible Asian ancestry. Five missing people have been excluded as possible identities of the subject.  Indiana  = Floyd County John Doe = Floyd County John Doe On Christmas Day, 1977, the body of a black male was found in a culvert in Floyd County, Indiana. He was shot in the head and was believed to have died a day before his discovery. The man was estimated to be between 18 and 25 years old and was six feet tall, with a weight of 155 to 175 pounds. The victim wore a knit cap, a jacket with the letters \\"E\\" and \\"D\\" on the front pocket, embroidered with red string. He also wore a black shirt, a blue sweatshirt, bluish pants and white tennis shoes. Several of his teeth were also missing. = Newton County John Does = Two young men of different races were found on October 18, 1983, in Lake Village, Newton County, Indiana. Both decedents are confirmed victims of serial killer Larry Eyler. In July 2020, the DNA Doe Project announced renewed genetic testing efforts to identify the African American victim, whom Eyler specifically stated he had murdered in July 1983. = Jasper County John Doe = The skeletonized body of a Caucasian male aged between 18 and 26 was discovered in Jasper County, Indiana, on October 15, 1983. The decedent had evidently been stabbed to death. He had shoulder-length, reddish-brown hair, was of a slight build and most likely between and in height. Furthermore, this individual had sustained a fracture to his left femur, which had healed prior to his murder. A Zippo lighter inscribed with the name Arlene was found close to the decedent's body, and the individual was wearing jeans and a gray hooded sweatshirt at the time of his murder, which is estimated to most likely have occurred sometime in 1982. As with the Newton County John Does, serial killer Larry Eyler confessed before his death in 1994 to killing this individual in addition to twenty other men‚Äîthree others of whom are still unidentified. Money was raised to bury the remains of this man in a formal, marked grave in 1986. In addition, DNA has been extracted from this decedent for genetic testing against individuals who may be related to him. = Hendricks County John Doe = On December 7, 1983, the skeletal remains of a young/middle aged African American man was found in a rural area near Clayton, Indiana. Cause of death could not be ascertained, but he is a confirmed victim of Larry Eyler. He was estimated to be between 25 and 39 years old, was 5 feet 9 inches tall, and weighed 140 pounds. He had black hair. He was only found wearing a pair of blue jeans. Based upon Eyler's modus operandi, investigators have presumed that the man was most likely homosexual, a hitchhiker, a prostitute, or a combination of the three. = \\"Madison\\" = On December 29, 1996, the skeletal remains of a young white female were found by hunters near US Route 31, three miles south of South Bend, Indiana. The cause of death could not be ascertained; however, it is being investigated as a homicide. She was estimated to be between 21 and 35 years old, was 5 feet 1 inch tall, and weighed 110 pounds. She had medium length brown hair and appeared to have spondylolysis. No clothing was found with the remains. She had excellent dental hygiene and had one filling. The area in which she was found is very rough, and is only accessible by ATVs. She is known as \\"Madison\\" to investigators. = Morgan County John Doe (1998) = On September 13, 1998, the decomposed remains of a young white male were found in a cornfield in rural Morgan County, Indiana. He had been killed by a blow to the head. He was estimated to be between 28 and 38 years old, was approximately 6 feet tall and weighed 170 pounds. He had shoulder length, reddish brown hair and a beard. He was wearing a black biker/USA T-shirt with wings, eagle, and flag on it, a pair of shorts, and a watch. The man was a known transient who frequented Indianapolis, and a sign reading \\"STRANDED HUNGRY GOD BLESS\\" with a smiley face was found near the body. Investigators believe that robbery was not a motive, as he still had his watch. He was buried in the Nutter Cemetery in October, 1998.  Kansas  = Dickinson County John Doe = On July 24, 1974, the decomposed remains of a young, white male were discovered on a dirt road in Upland, Kansas, by a man who was visiting his parents. The man had been shot to death. He was estimated to be between 25 to 31 year old, was between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed between 140 and 150 pounds. He had brown, wavy, medium length hair. He was wearing a dark red, four-button, pullover shirt, a brown pullover, blue jeans, blue knit socks, and a pair of boots. Cecil Henry Floyd, a convicted serial killer, later confessed to killing the man after being sentenced to life in prison for an unrelated crime. He claimed that his family and he would travel the country would pick up transients and hitchhikers, killing them for their money. According to Floyd, the man was picked up in western Kansas, and pulled onto the dirt road after travelling with him. There, he claimed there was an issue with the tire. When the man got out to help, Floyd shot him to death and robbed him. The victim is currently buried in Albilene Cemetery. His body was exhumed in 2016 for DNA testing.  Kentucky  = Grant County John Doe = On April 9, 1980, the decomposing remains of a young-middle aged white male were found in a tobacco barn on State Route 22, seven miles west of Dry Ridge, Kentucky. He had been shot twice in the back of the head with a .22 caliber weapon. He had also been deceased for about two weeks. He was between 25 and 39 years old, was 6 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed 220 pounds. He had medium-brown hair styled in a crew cut with short sideburns. He had extensive dental work. His hands had been severed, possibly in an attempt to prevent identification. He had also been stripped of all clothing. His case was taken on by the DNA Doe Project in February, 2020. The project is currently accepting donations for DNA to be extracted and sequenced from his body. DNA was successfully extracted and sequenced in August, 2020. = Carroll County John Doe = On September 1, 1980, the skeletal remains of a middle aged white man were found after flood waters receded from the Ohio River near Carrollton, Kentucky. He had been killed by blunt force trauma to the back of the head. He was estimated to be between 40 and 55 years old and was approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall. He had light to medium brown hair, and evidence of a previous broken nose, left ankle, and foot. He may have suffered from arthritis and poor nourishment or drug use. He also had no teeth. A possible connection was made in 2017 to a missing man, George Hawkins, who bore a resemblance to the victim, but he was later excluded from the case. = Owen County Jane Doe = On May 6, 1988, the decomposed remains of a young white female were located in an open field on the side of State Route 330, 18 miles south of Owenton, Kentucky. She had been strangled to death. She was estimated to be between 25 and 40 years old, was between 5 feet and 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 120 pounds. Her left arm and hand were not recovered. She had dark brown/black hair with some grey, in a bob styled haircut. She had possibly given birth in the past, and had a crude, homemade tattoo on her right arm which read \\"Steve\\". She was found wearing a pair of men's black or dark brown dress socks with green toes. A brown nylon blouse, a pair of men's sneakers, faded jeans, and a blue bra were found nearby. A witness claimed to have seen the woman on a freeway near a diner that was popular with truckers. In 2019, Parabon Nanolabs began genealogy research on the woman to try to find her identity. Phenotyping testing is also being done to try to determine her features more accurately. In 2020, it was announced that she may have had ties to Columbus, Ohio or Miami, Florida. = Barren County Doe = On August 8, 1989, a blue suitcase containing the skeleton of a toddler was discovered near the Barren River Lake, Glasgow, Barren County, Kentucky. The victim was estimated to have been between two and three years old and its sex was not possible to determine, though some believe that the child was female. The victim, who may have been biracial, had been deceased for one to six months and the case was ruled as a homicide. After it was made public that the body was found, a person claiming to be an attorney placed three phone calls to Kentucky State Police, requesting legal immunity for a woman in exchange for information the woman had about the child. However, after those three calls, the supposed attorney never contacted police again. = Daviess County John Doe = On January 7, 1990, the body of a young white male was found by a pair of rabbit hunters, east of Owensboro, Kentucky. He had been shot multiple times, stripped of clothing and covered by a pile of wigs. Blunt force trauma was also found to the face, and his hands and feet were missing. He was estimated to be between 25 and 40 years old, was between 5 feet and 5 feet 7 inches tall, and weighed between 125 and 140 pounds. He had curly, medium length brown hair with graying near the temples. Eye color was originally listed as brown but may have been blue. He had a fair complexion with tanned arms. A pair of prescription eyeglasses were found near the body. Investigators believe the man wasn't from the area, and had been deposited after being murdered, as no blood was found at the scene. He was misidentified in 2007 as Scott Michael Morris, until DNA testing proved the two men were not related. = \\"Mary Eve\\" = On Christmas Eve, 1992, the body of a female infant of possibly mixed race was found in a trash bag in the employee parking lot of Oxmoor Center on Shelbyville Road in Louisville. The mother was never found. A member of the mall's security team posthumously adopted the baby, naming her \\"Mary Eve\\" because she was found on Christmas Eve. = Lyon County John Doe = On May 6, 1999, the decomposing remains of a young/middle aged white man were found floating in Lake Barkley in Eddyville, Kentucky. His body was wrapped in tire chains and anchored by an eight ton hydraulic jack, leading investigators to deem his death a homicide. He was believed to have been in the water for between five and twelve months. He was between 25 and 50 years old, was between 5 feet 6 inches and 6 feet 3 inches tall, and weighed between 200 and 250 pounds. He was thought to have had brown hair and had brown eyes. He had previously suffered a broken leg during his life. He was found wearing a white T-shirt, a dark Dallas Cowboys jacket, a light green Reebok jacket, blue jeans, a black leather belt, white sneakers and white socks. Chemical isotope testing indicated that the man was native to the United States. = Simpson County Jane Doe = On October 9, 2001, the skeletal remains of a young white female were found by a survey crew at the bottom of the shoulder of Interstate 65 near the Tennessee state line in rural Simpson County, Kentucky. The cause of death was not ascertained, but the case was deemed a homicide due to the circumstances. She had been deceased for between two weeks and two months. She was estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old, was between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall, and weighed between 90 and 130 pounds. She had long reddish-brown or reddish-blonde hair. She also had a healed fracture on her upper right arm, and a tattoo of the outline of a rose on her left breast. She had a scar on her face and right wrist. She was missing multiple teeth and had very poor dental health. She also had given birth to a child in the past, and may have been pregnant when she died. She was found wearing a white/tan shirt, blue cotton shorts, and black sandals. Two rings were also found near the body: a gold wedding-style band, and a sterling silver ring in a guilloche cigar band style, with a painted blue enamel background with flowers and leaves. The silver ring was traced to the Vargas Manufacturing Company in Providence, Rhode Island. Her case was taken on by the DNA Doe Project in May, 2019. Isotope testing found that she may have been native to the Great Lakes region or New England. = Jefferson County Jane Doe (2005) = On July 22, 2005, a construction crew was clearing a lot in Shivley, Kentucky, when they uncovered the skeletal remains of a young/middle aged white female. Investigators deemed she was a victim of homicide due to the way her body was laid and positioned. She was estimated to be between 20 and 40 years old and was approximately 5 feet 3 inches tall. She may have had straight brown hair and a narrow nose. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. The area in which she was found used to be an ice cream supply house, and then a junk yard. She may have been deceased for anywhere between two to fifteen years.  Louisiana  = West Baton Rouge Parish Jane Doe = On February 20, 1985, the skeletal remains of a young white female were found buried under a pile of large rocks behind the levee of the Mississippi River near Port Allen, Louisiana, directly across from a church. Cause of death was uncertain, but may be homicidal due to the circumstances in which she was found. She had been deceased for possibly three months. She was between 24 and 33 years old, was between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed 115 pounds. She had long, dark brown hair and had a petite build. She had two malformed ribs, possibly due to a birth defect. She was found with four turquoise and silver rings, and a bracelet. Investigators could not find any signs of injury to the woman's skeleton. = Sabine Parish John Doe = On April 18, 1986, the partial skeletal remains of a young/middle aged white male were discovered in a well in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, when the property owner was cleaning it out. He had been stabbed to death, then thrown into the well. He was estimated to be between 30 and 45 years old. He had an injury to his left hip bone and what appeared to be over two dozen shotgun pellets embedded in the bone, meaning he had been shot while alive. Investigators noted that this would have caused the man pain and made him walk with a limp. He was found wearing a blue shirt, blue knit pants, a brown belt, a light blazer jacket, and one sneaker. A key ring with 5 keys, a folding brush-comb combination, a Snoopy night light, and a small pocket knife were found on his person. The road in which the man was found on serves as a cutoff between State Route 6 and State Route 191, being a good place to dump the body for someone familiar with the area. His skull had been fractured just before his death, and he had possibly been stabbed in the back twice. = Slidell Jane Doe = On June 19, 1986, the body of a white female aged between 20 and 30 was found in Slidell, Saint Tammany Parish, Louisiana, in Lake Pontchartrain. She had been murdered around one to two days prior to her discovery, and her body had already begun to decompose. The cause of her death was ruled to be a combination of asphyxiation and stabbing, as wounds were visible on her face. Her hair was either a light brown or red, which was shoulder length. She also had freckles and had received breast implants. It is believed this decedent had been married, as her left ring finger showed that a ring had been worn at one time, but had been recently removed, likely by her killer. She was also three months pregnant. The decedent was of a petite stature, standing at five feet two to four inches, and weighed an estimated 126 pounds. Her body was nude with a plastic bag that had been placed over her head and a weight was tied to her neck to ensure her remains would not surface. After her autopsy, examiners concluded that the victim may have been involved in an automobile accident prior to her murder, as evidence on her hips showed signs of healed fractures. It was also possible that a rhinoplasty was performed on her nose, which may have been due to the same reason. Scars were also found on her abdomen, her knee and one wrist. Her teeth were excellently cared for, although some were possibly congenitally missing and all of her wisdom teeth had been removed. = Beauregard Parish John Doe = The body of a man of African heritage, 25 to 40 years old, was found on January 4, 1993 in Bancroft, Beauregard Parish, Louisiana. Examiners believe he had been killed within three to four weeks before, as the state of decomposition was severe in some areas of the body, resulting in partial skeletonization. His remains were disposed of in the woods, located in proximity to Highway 389. He wore tan shoes, blue jeans, had short hair and very healthy teeth and had broken his nose once in his life. He had been shot twice in the head. =St. Tammany Parish John Doe (2016)= The partially dismembered body of a White and Middle Eastern male aged 65 or older was discovered in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana on July 29, 2016. The victim had died about three days before and was dumped at the scene following his murder. His body was in an advanced stage of decomposition. A scar, possibly from an open heart surgery was present on his chest. His height was estimated to be about 5'10. His arms and one leg were removed, possibly to conceal unique tattoos or marks on his body. Investigators were unsure of certain traits the man had until DNA phenotyping was performed by the Parabon NanoLabs. The results indicated he had brown or hazel eyes, dark brown hair and a fair complexion. The victim or the individuals responsible for his death may have links to the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the victim himself may have been a transient. In 2018 the DNA Doe Project took on this case and analyzed his DNA to try to match with potential relatives.  Maine  = Aroostook County Jane Doe = The body of a full-term baby girl with an attached umbilical cord was found December 7, 1985, in Frenchville, Maine. Her body was found by a dog, which then brought it to its owners. The infant had died of exposure within a half hour of her birth, due to extremely cold temperatures. She had been abandoned in a gravel pit. Examiners determined that the dog had not caused injury to the baby. At the location, several bloody footprints were found, believed to have been left there by the infant's mother. Investigators suspect the baby's mother may be Canadian.  Maryland  = Prince George's County Jane Doe (1972) = On December 1, 1972, the skeletal remains of a young white female were discovered in a wooded area near the Baltimore- Washington Parkway and State Route 197 near Laurel, Maryland. Cause of death could not be determined but it is believed she was killed by homicidal means. She was estimated to be between 19 and 25 years old, and was 5 feet 1 inch tall. She had dirty blond to reddish brown hair, and may have appeared older than she actually was. Weight, and eye color could not be ascertained. She had had extensive dental work, however, her teeth were decayed. In 2018, serial killer, Samuel Little confessed to killing the woman. He described her as an attractive woman with green eyes, dark hair, and full lips. He also claimed she was a prostitute that he picked up at a Greyhound bus station. She remained in his company for three days before Little strangled her at the location she was found. = Woodlawn Jane Doe = = \\"Cheerleader in the Trunk\\" = The Cheerleader in the Trunk likely participated in gymnastics, dancing or cheerleading, as evidence on her bones suggests. On August 24, 1982, the skeletonized remains of a young woman were discovered concealed inside a footlocker in Frederick, Maryland by two hikers. The decedent is estimated to have died between 1972 and 1982, with pathologists determining she had most likely died at least three years prior to the discovery of her body.doenetwork.orgcase 431UFMD Her age is estimated to have been anywhere between 17 and 45 years old, although the most likely age range of this decedent is between 18 and 25 years old. She had medium length, brown or reddish brown hair and is estimated to have stood between five feet two inches and five feet six inches in height. Evidence such as spondylolysis on her bones indicates that she may have been a gymnast or dance performer in life. She had also received extensive dental work on her teeth. Between the 1980s and 2012, three composites were created. Many leads have surfaced, including ten missing persons that have been ruled out in the case. = Harford County John Doe = The body of an Asian male, aged between 20 and 30, was located on January 9, 1987, in Abingdon, Harford County. He was murdered just days prior to the discovery of his body and had been killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. His body was abandoned at the side of a highway and was bound, wrapped in plastic and then covered with a sheet. He was around five feet five to five feet seven inches in height and weighed approximately 134 pounds. The man had several scars on his face, one near his upper lip and four on the top of his head, which had healed. The victim had black, straight hair and brown eyes. He wore a pair of reddish and white nylon swim trunks that had a blue stripe and brown lining. By studying the teeth of the decedent (which displayed no signs of dental care) it is presumed that he had a habit of using tobacco products. His case has been published in Asian media, which has not yet produced any more clues to his identity or killer. = Frederick County Jane Doe = The remains of a female aged between 16 and 25, known as Maryland's Unknown Child, was discovered on July 31, 1991, in Frederick County, Maryland, near a truck stop. The remains were badly decomposed to the point where the cause of death was not able to be determined. She was located underneath an overpass, which suggests being disposed of after a murder. The victim was between five feet and five feet two inches tall, weighing 110-120 pounds. The hair was described to be dark and wavy and a tooth protruded from her upper set of teeth. A tank top and several pieces of jewelry were found on her arms, hands, neck and ankle. A silver and gold colored wristwatch was also worn by the girl. Four forensic facial reconstructions of the decedent have since been created; each varying strongly from the others. It was reported that a man convicted of the murder of a woman native to Ohio in Tennessee, who was a trucker, may have been involved. At his house, authorities discovered shoes and underwear, two types of clothing that the Frederick County Jane Doe was not wearing. = Prince George's County Jane Doe (2000) = The body of a female of African heritage was located in a creek in Clinton, Prince George's County, on March 25, 2000. The victim was between 13 and 35 years old at the time of her death, with her most likely age range being between 15 and 30. She is estimated to have been murdered in 1999 or the year of the discovery of her body. The decedent had been beaten to death, and may have been a victim of a sexual crime, as no clothing below her waist was present on her body. The female had brown eyes and black hair accompanied with hair extensions which were approximately a foot long. She wore clothing including a whitish undershirt and a similarly-colored T-shirt from a 1995 Special Olympics event held in Connecticut, a white sports bra, a pullover shirt with the phrase \\"Beefy-T\\" written on the tag, and a denim jacket. She also wore a Tweety watch and had painted her fingernails purple. Her initials could possibly have been \\"C.S.,\\" as these initials were found written on the tag of one of her shirts. Although her lower jaw was not found, she did not appear to have received any dental care in life. = Prince George's County John Doe (2000) = On April 13, 2000, the decomposed body of a young man of mixed race was found in Beaver Dam Creek on the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland.

Massachusetts  = \\"Lady of the Dunes\\" = An unidentified woman whose body was discovered on July 26, 1974, in the Race Point Dunes, Provincetown, Massachusetts. She had been murdered by extensive blunt force trauma to the head, and her killer had made several attempts to prevent her body from being identified. Although Hadden Clark has confessed to her murder, many believe this confession to have been false. Former FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted organized crime boss Whitey Bulger may have a connection to the case. = Middlesex County John Doe = On May 22, 1975, the decomposed remains of a young white male were found in a shallow grave in a wooded area in Burlington, Massachusetts.

He was found wearing an Army field jacket, a T-shirt, jeans, a pair of cheap canvas sneakers, black socks, and a garrison type belt with a distinctive buckle. A unique medallion was also found with the victim. The area in which the man was found was a known lovers lane for locals, and his body was found relatively close to the road. It is also within a mile of Interstate 95 and State Route 3. Investigators believe that the medallion the victim had may have had some affiliation with motorcycle gangs which were in the area during the time. A few members had also lived close by. = Hampshire County Jane Doe = On November 15, 1978, the body of a young female was found in a shallow grave under a log in Granby, Massachusetts.

She was found wearing a short sleeved shirt with a green collar and a green swan on the front. Potential witnesses were searched for in the area, as State Route 116, which was nearby, was used frequently for hitchhiking college students. No women were reported missing in the area. = Popes Island Jane Doe = Facial reconstruction of the Popes Island Jane Doe, who may have been an undocumented immigrant from Belarus The ring worn by the Popes Island Jane Doe The body of a woman aged between 30 and 45 years old was recovered from the Popes Island Marina in New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts on October 30, 1996.

The decedent had naturally light brown hair (which was dyed strawberry blond) and had brown eyes. She wore a yellow shirt, a white pullover with rectangular shapes and high heeled boots. She wore a gold ring with a green stone which experts say comes from Belarus, a part of the old Soviet Union. She had also received dental work that is believed to have been performed outside of the country. However, one instance of root canal surgery had been performed inside the United States. The woman had not shaved beneath her arms or shaved her legs, which may indicate she was from a foreign country with different cultural practices. Because of the lack of identification and fingerprint matches, the woman may have entered the United States without documentation. = Suffolk County John Does (1988) = On October 6, 1988, the decomposed bodies of two young African American males were found in a wooded area in Dorchester, Massachusetts. They had both been shot to death. Investigators believe that the boys were possibly from The Bronx, and may have been of Jamaican ancestry.

She had brown hair with a reddish tint, and was wearing a wig. She also was light skinned and had a petite build. She was wearing purple nail polish as well. Surveillance camera captured Eugene McCollom dumping the body, wrapped in a blanket. He stated that her name was \\"Lisa\\" and that she was a prostitute from \\"Philly\\". He had picked her up in Boston and took her to his room at the YMCA in Lynn, Massachusetts. They got into an argument about money, and he strangled her soon after. McCollom pled guilty to the murder in 2005. = Suffolk County Jane Doe (2005) = On October 14, 2005, a chimney sweep was hired to clean out the chimney of an apartment building in Dorchester, Massachusetts. There he discovered the skeletal remains of a young white/Hispanic (with possible African American/Asian admixture) female. She had been in the chimney for anywhere between three months and five years. Cause of death was not determined, but was most likely a homicide. She was between 25 and 35 years old and was between 4 feet 11 inches and 5 feet 5 inches tall. She had long black/dark brown hair which was dyed a reddish color. Eye color and weight could not be ascertained, but it was noted that she had a small to medium build. She had red plastic fingernails, as well as evidence of childbirth during her life. She was found to have an unusual dental plate, which was poorly made, most likely not from a dentist. The chimney in which the woman was found had been used for an incinerator during the 1960s, however by the time her body had been deposited in, it was being used as an opening for an air conditioner. Investigators believe that whoever put the woman's body in the chimney must have known about it beforehand, as it was difficult to find. An access door had also been left unlocked between January 2002 and January 2005, leaving easy access to the area. = Barnstable County John Doe = left On June 4, 2014, the torso of a man of African heritage was found on a beach in Sandwich, Barnstable County, Massachusetts with his head and all four limbs missing. It is believed that the man was around six feet tall and weighed between 220 and 230 pounds. His body was found on the beach wrapped in a blue tarp and attached to a moving dolly. A surgical scar was also present, but it was unrelated to the murder. Another identifying feature was a T-shirt for a Rhode Island pipe distribution company, although the quantity of the shirts handed out each year prevented easy identification. In 2020, his face was reconstructed using DNA phenotyping.  Michigan   Minnesota  = Washington County Jane Doe = The severed head of an adult white female was discovered on the shore of Bone Lake in Scandia, Washington County, Minnesota on June 12, 1993. Soon after the head was discovered, a left foot was found in St. Paul, Minnesota, which was twenty miles away. Medical examiners believe that the foot had belonged to the same woman. The foot had fragments of red nail polish. Both cuts made to sever her head and foot had been made cleanly, possibly due to the killer having experience with butchering or hunting. Her remains may have been disposed of in the Mississippi River, as both locations where the parts were found are linked to the river. The woman had short, dark hair, which may have been spiked when she was alive, and she also had a short ponytail at the back of her head. The victim had brown eyes and likely wore earrings, as both of her ears were pierced three times. The age of this decedent has been disputed, with some describing her to be as young as twenty; others saying she may have been as old as sixty-five. = Isanti County John Doe = On August 17, 2003, the skeletal remains of a young white male were discovered by an excavator operator on a private residence near State Route 47 in Isanti County, Minnesota, when the excavator uncovered a skull in the mound of earth. Cause of death could not be ascertained, however it is being treated as a homicide. The man was estimated to be between 20 and 28 years old, and was 5 feet 9 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. A watch and part of a red and yellow blanket were found with the remains. Investigators believe the body was dumped at the location, as the highway near which the body was found leads out of some of the major metropolitan areas of Minnesota. No missing persons reports matched the man. The face and dental characteristics were able to be precisely recreated by a forensic artist, however other details are simply the best guess made by the artist.  Mississippi  = Jackson County Jane Doe (1977) = On December 27, 1977, three men rabbit hunting discovered the skeletal remains of a young/middle aged African American female near Interstate 10 and State Route 63 in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Cause of death was uncertain, but believed to be a homicide. She was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old and was between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 10 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained, but evidence was found that she may have worn a wig. She was also found to have some kind of surgery/injury to her ankle which may have caused her to limp. She also had a defect in her jaw joint and likely smoked/chewed tobacco. She had also given birth at least once during her life. In 2018, Samuel Little confessed to murdering a woman in the area which closely resembled the Doe. He said that she worked as a pipe fitter at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, and lived in a boarding house in Gulfport. He had met her at a bar and later took the woman out, and described her as a \\"great person who would have made a wonderful wife\\". The boarding house and bar at which they were at have since been torn down. He claimed he strangled her and left her body in a wooded area off of a dirt road. = \\"Delta Dawn\\" = An infant or toddler found floating in a river in Moss Point, Mississippi in December 1982. She had been partially smothered, then thrown from a bridge into the Escatawpa River by an individual suspected to be her mother. This child had then died of drowning. = Jackson County John Doe (1982) = During an additional search to find the remains of Delta Dawn's mother/killer, authorities instead uncovered the skeletal remains of a young African American male. He had been shot to death. He was estimated to be between 18 and 22 years old, was 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed between 120 and 170 pounds. Hair color and eye color could not be ascertained. Investigators believe that he was left handed, and he had an injury to the head which would have left a visible scar on his forehead. Investigators believe that he had nothing to do with Delta Dawn's case, but still had been thrown off the bridge after being killed. = Desoto County Jane Doe = Desoto County Jane Doe Desoto County Jane Doe is a woman whose body was discovered alongside U.S. Route 78 on February 24, 1985, in Olive Branch, DeSoto County. She is estimated to have been between 20 and 35 at the time of her death and was wearing only a pinkish-orange pullover along with jeans at the time of her discovery. Her shoes were missing, possibly having been retained by her killer. The decedent had unique tattoos of the letters \\"T.H.C.\\" and \\"R.E.J.\\" (or possibly \\"R.E.T.\\") on her ankles, and had reddish or strawberry-blond hair. Her eyes have been stated to be gray or brown by various sources. The victim was killed by ligature strangulation and had possibly been subjected to a sexual assault. This decedent is known to have both smoked frequently and to have regularly bitten her nails in life; habits that may assist in leading to her identification. The victim also had a surgical scar on her left arm and other scars on her hand. The woman wore three earrings in each ear and was approximately five feet three inches in height and weighed 110 pounds. = Lincoln County Jane Doe = On September 17, 1989, the body of a young white (with possible Native American or Asian admixture) woman was found in some bushes at a Rest area on Interstate 55 in Lincoln County, Mississippi.

She was found only wearing a pair of white athletic socks, with three blue stripes. Two suspects were later charged in her death, and they claimed that she was a prostitute they had picked up in New Orleans, Louisiana. They had intended to rob her instead of killing her, and did not know her name. FBI Reconstruction of Vancleave Jane Doe = Vancleave Jane Doe = On February 1, 1991, the skeletal remains of a white woman were found by hunters in Vancleave, Mississippi. Cause of death was not determined but believed to be a homicide. She was between 25 and 60 years old, between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed between 105 and 135 pounds.

FBI Reconstruction of Jackson County John Doe (1992) = Jackson County John Doe (1992) = On April 17, 1992, the mummified remains of a middle aged white man were found washed ashore on Bayou Rosa in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Cause of death could not be determined, but is possibly homicidal due to what appeared to be superficial facial wounds and that his body had been frozen for several months. He had been in the water for between two to three weeks. He was between 30 and 50 years old, was between 5 feet 8 inches and 6 feet tall and weighed between 150 and 180 pounds. He had graying brown hair. He was described as slightly obese or robust and had a pronounced, square jaw line. He also appeared to have mild arthritis in his elbows and gallstones. He was found wearing white jockey underwear with the tag removed. He may have possibly not been native to the United States. = Jackson County John Doe (2001)= A \\"middle aged\\" man's body was found wrapped in carpeting and a blanket along a road in Pascagoula, Jackson County, Mississippi on June 18, 2001. He was of white or Hispanic ethnicity and was estimated to be five feet five to five feet seven inches in height and weighed about 250 pounds.

One was a crescent shape above his left eye, another on his forehead, on the side of his nose and a possible gunshot scar on one of the wrists. He was clothed in a white T-shirt, jogging shorts and pants and was murdered about two days before the discovery. The murder of the victim has been solved, as a subject was apprehended in 2004. However, the victim remains unidentified, although he may have been native to Texas.  Missouri  = St. Charles County Jane Doe = The body of a white girl aged two to three years was discovered inside a suitcase that had been thrown into Lake Alton in West Alton, Missouri, in St. Charles County on February 1, 1968. This decedent is also known Jane Doe West Alton. The child's remains were recovered by two fishermen who had hooked their line on the suitcase, which had been wrapped in blue clothesline and weighted with two 10-pound barbells found inside the suitcase. Distinctive features noted of her remains were an abnormally large tooth and a scar above one of her eyes. She had long, blond hair, although due to decomposition, her eye color could not be determined. She was approximately 2 feet 8 inches tall and weighed between 35 and 40 pounds. The sole item of clothing on her remains was a pair of white underwear. The child had been dead for up to one month before her body was discovered. She was identified as a homicide victim, although authorities declined to reveal the precise method used to kill her. She was laid to rest on February 7 in an unmarked grave in the children's section of Oak Grove Cemetery. After an image of the child was constructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in September 2015, the body was exhumed on September 24 from her unmarked grave in an effort to obtain a DNA sample. Investigators later announced that the DNA testing conducted on her remains was unsuccessful. Nonetheless, the exhumation would yield a more accurate estimation of the girl's age at the time of her death. Her skull was studied to create a more accurate composite image of her appearance in life. = Pulaski County Jane Doe (1981) = On May 25, 1981, the body of a young white(with possible Native American and Hispanic admixture) female was discovered in a low water crossing near Highway MM, just north of Dixon, Missouri.

She was found wearing a dark blue long-sleeved blouse with white pinstripes, blue jeans, blue bikini panties, and a bra with the name \\"Jubel\\", \\"Julie\\", or \\"Juliet\\" written on it. Isotope testing determined that she had only lived in Missouri for a few years before her demise, and was likely from the southeastern US, between Texas, Georgia, and Florida. The DNA Doe Project began investigating her identity in May, 2019. Investigations into her genealogy have so far uncovered an extensive family tree. =St. Louis Jane Doe= A girl of African heritage whose headless body was found inside an abandoned property in 1983. Her head has never been found. = Clay County Jane Doe = On April 18, 1985, the partial, skeletal remains of a young, African American female were discovered in a field near State Route 210, near Cooley Lake, about 11 miles east of Missouri City, Missouri.

Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. Her teeth were found to have not been well cared for, with various teeth decaying. She was initially speculated to be Caucasian, however it was later found that she was African American or Biracial. A brown tortoise shell comb was found with her remains. In 2016, investigators received a tip that the woman's name may have possibly been \\"Darlene\\", and she resided in Kansas City, Kansas with two children, working at an envelope company. = \\"Grace Doe\\" = The decomposing body of a woman aged between 21 and 31 was found on December 2, 1990, in McDonald County, Missouri. The woman was possibly of mixed ancestry, having characteristics of both white and Native Americans. She had been tied with several different types of rope, her hands behind her back and fastened to one of her legs, which led some to presume she was a victim of rape or another form of sexual assault. One of the ropes was identified to be from a parachute, which may have originated from some sort of military branch. She was possibly killed at the scene, as a witness reported that he \\"heard a woman scream\\" around the time the Jane Doe would have died. = St. Louis John Doe (1992) = On March 7, 1992, the skeleton of a white male aged between 15 and 25 was located in St. Louis, Missouri in an abandoned building that had previously burned down. He was approximately five feet seven to five feet ten inches tall at a weight around 145 pounds. His hair was either blond or brown and was two inches in length. The decedent had received a fracture to his arm that had healed before his death, indicating some sort of injury was sustained when he was alive. His dentition was good and he did have some crooked teeth on the top set; four of his molars were repaired. The clothing he wore included a pink shirt, a white shirt with an embossed logo of Myrtle Beach, a black coat, boxers with stripes, jeans, socks and size eight shoes. The case is considered a homicide, as evidence of numerous stab wounds were discovered on his ribs. He was originally believed to have been a black male as old as forty-five. After his remains were exhumed for additional physical information, his skull was absent and his coffin was subjected to damage. He could have been deceased from the years 1989 to 1992. = Vernon County John Doe (2000) = In January 2000, the skeletal remains of a white man estimated to be between 26 and 36 years of age were discovered in a remote area of Nevada, Missouri, in Vernon County.

She stood between 4'10 and 5'2, weighing between 90 and 110 pounds. Examination indicated that she had a history of smoking and had many fillings as well as two root canals. She also had a type of oral surgery which is distinct to Asia's dental techniques, involving the screwing of a dental post into the tooth. It is possible that serial killer and rapist Wayne Nance may be the killer. Due to his death in 1986, he was never tried or convicted of any murder. Two other victims believed to have been killed by Nance are \\"Debbie Deer Creek\\" and \\"Betty Beavertail,\\" later identified as Marcella Bachmann and Devonna Nelson, respectively. He also may have committed the murders of two others prior to the Jane Doe discoveries.

She had suffered multiple blows to the head and had been dismembered, with the torso never being found. She had been deceased for between six months and a year. The blows to the head may have occurred postmortem. She was between 25 and 40 years old and was between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 8 inches tall. She had long, dark hair. She also had a healed injury to her right femur, which may have affected her walking. The only item of clothing found was a sterling-silver ring with turquoise and triangular shaped stones, inlaid in an alternating pattern. = \\"Valerie Doe\\" = On May 26, 1991, the partial skeletal remains of a young white female were found in a shallow grave in Black Rock Desert, Nevada by three travelers. She had been shot in the head at least once and had been deceased for between one to four years. She was estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old and was approximately 5 feet 2 inches tall. Weight, hair color and eye color could not be ascertained. She was found wearing a pair of denim jeans which had been manufactured in England, a black blouse manufactured in Turkey, a dark camisole slip, a bracelet in the shape of a sea serpent and a bracelet with the name \\"Valerie\\" on it, leading to the nickname, \\"Valerie Doe\\". = Lyon County John Doe = On March 12, 1992, an anonymous phone call led Nevada Highway Patrol to a set of skeletal remains in a canyon about a mile east of State Route 338 near Wellington, Nevada. A shallow grave was found near the remains and they had been scattered by animal activity. His hands and feet were not recovered; these circumstances leading to the assumption that he had been killed by homicidal means. The man was between 35 and 50 years old and was approximately 6 feet 1 inch tall. He had reddish-brown hair. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. He was found only in a pullover T-shirt, the only recoverable part showing the design of a feather, possibly from a bird with the full shirt.

Items found in the site included a blanket, a black hat with the words \\"Heavenly Lake Tahoe\\" on it, a pair of jeans, a pair of black underpants and a broken dog collar. In October 1991, another anonymous phone call had reported an abandoned Pontiac Grand Prix near the site, which had been registered to a man in Oklahoma. The car may be related due to being found within two miles of the site. The owner was tracked down in 1999 and interviewed. In 1999, a woman who lived nearby claimed that a dog would often come to her house and leave in the direction of the campsite. The dog was missing a collar and the woman was able to provide a photograph of the dog. Investigators also followed up potential leads with the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, California, to see if the man was possibly a deserter. This also provided no leads. = Elko County Jane Doe (1993) = 3D reconstruction of the Elko County Jane Doe The nude body of a female, also known as the Shafter Jane Doe, was discovered on November 16, 1993, around six days after her murder had occurred. She was aged between 20 and 35, and had been shot twice: once in the chest region, and once in the back. She had also been beaten. She was five feet eight inches and 144 pounds with brown eyes and pierced ears, although the earrings were missing, possibly being taken by the killer. She also had painted her fingernails pink at one time. After examination, it was determined that she had used both alcohol and marijuana prior to her death, possibly given birth to a child in the past, and had very healthy teeth. Isotope analysis narrowed her recent place of residence to the city of Afton, Wyoming. Tire tracks near the body indicated that the killer's vehicle was either a pickup truck or a van. The victim had a mole above her right ear and two scars on her lower right leg. = \\"Silver State Jane Doe\\" = On September 19, 1995, the dismembered torso as well as legs and head of a young white/Hispanic female were found at the Silver State Recycling Facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada.

She was around five feet two to five feet five inches tall, 115 to 130 pounds and wore sandals and red socks on her feet, blue cutoff shorts and a reddish blouse. The woman may have had brown hair, which was incorporated in the first of two facial reconstructions. In 2006, a second facial reconstruction was created. This decedent is also known as \\"Juliet Doe.\\" In May, 2020, the DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identification. = Bear Brook Jane Doe = The remaining unidentified murder victim found in Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown, New Hampshire on May 9, 2000.

The decedent had straight, light brown or auburn hair of approximately shoulder length, although her hair may have actually been a wig, as her hair bore evidence of artificial coloration and had various shades of color with the presence of coloring additive. Also found in her possession was a motel key; this key belonged to a nearby motel on the Garden State Parkway. The victim was estimated to have been between 12 and 18 years of age, and her cause of death may have been strangulation.

However, her teeth bore little evidence of decay, although one of her molars was slightly damaged. = Sussex County Jane Doe = On June 24, 1980, the skeletal remains of a woman were found in High Point State Park in Sussex County, New Jersey. Her body had been extensively dismembered with a saw, with sections of the body being placed in various trash bags, which had subsequently been disturbed by animals. The bones of her torso were never located. The victim was between 13 and 20 years old. Her actual race was difficult to determine, but was determined to be white with an unknown admixture, possibly Hispanic. Her height was between 5 feet and 5 feet 2 inches, and she may have been overweight, although her remains were too decomposed to establish an estimation of her precise weight. Her straight, medium-length hair was dark brown, but had been bleached blond. She wore distinctive jeans that had various colors on one of the legs. Her teeth were also considered unique by examiners, as they were of a distinct shape and although they showed no signs of dental care, were well maintained. = \\"Princess Doe\\" = The body of a teenage girl aged between the ages of 15 and 20 found on July 15, 1982, in Blairstown, New Jersey.

She was white, approximately twenty-inches tall and weighed around seven pounds, with dark hair and brown eyes. After the child's murder, she was wrapped in a distinct pink, black and white towel depicting an African landscape and then placed inside of a gray trash bag. The victim herself has been reconstructed and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have also created an estimation of what her mother may have looked like, although she has never been located. = Gloucester County Jane Doe (2004) = On March 2, 2004, a woman's remains were found in Logan Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey. She is believed to have been multiracial, as traits from Caucasian, Hispanic and Asian races were found during her autopsy, which led to several reconstructions being made to illustrate her potential likeness. The woman was aged between 18 and 30 when she was murdered by an undetermined cause. The victim had long dark hair with light highlights and was believed to be at a height between four feet eleven to five feet two inches at a weight between 80 and 110 pounds. Her body was partially disrobed and had also been burned, along with evidence that animals had scavenged the body, after it was dumped alongside interstate 295.

Although the cause of the young woman's death was not discovered, it has been listed as suspicious. It was believed that she had been deceased for approximately three weeks prior to her discovery. Because of this fact, her remains were in an advanced state of decomposition, which may have erased any signs of trauma that she could have endured. In her long, black and braided hair, red and copper-colored extensions were found. The decedent also wore camouflage pants, boy's underwear, a pink halter top and a black bra with red lace. White socks with orange on the toe area with a green teddy bear design on the side were found on her feet and no shoes were reported to have been found.

Due to decomposition, only partial fingerprints were obtained and the eye color or any possible tattoos or scars could not be determined or found. Her DNA and dental information was obtained. She had some spaces between her upper front teeth, along with one dental filling on one of her back teeth. Because of heavy traffic on the road she was found, her body could have been transported from anywhere in the United States.  New Mexico  = Guadalupe County Jane Doe = On July 11, 1978, a foreman for the New Mexico Highway Department of Transportation found the body of a young woman along Highway 216. She was five feet and eight inches tall, weighed around 145 pounds, and had blonde hair and blue eyes. Her left ear was pierced three times and her right ear was pierced twice.

While he did not remember her name, she allegedly said that her July 11 was her seventeenth birthday and she planned to call her mother that day, but she was killed before she could do so. However, NamUs estimates her age to be 25 years old. =Do√±a Ana County Jane Doe= On March 10, 1985, the skeleton of a female aged 16 to 20 was discovered by a group of hunters, hidden under plastic and buried in a shallow grave in Do√±a Ana County, New Mexico. The decedent had died approximately three to six months before her body was discovered. She is believed to have been white and had blonde or light brown hair, which was likely her natural color, as the presence of pubic hair of the same color indicated. She had painted at least two of her fingernails pink and her skeletal structure bore evidence of abnormalities, some specific conditions of which were noted by a forensic anthropologist to be unusual to occur in someone of the subject's age. The remains were clothed in pink undergarments and a white jersey with the letter \\"W.\\" Some of the supports in the Jane Doe's bra were noted to have separated from the product. She also appeared to have possibly suffered a healed injury to the right side of her nose. Her height was believed to be between five feet and five feet four inches tall (152‚Äì162 cm). Although her weight could not be determined, she was most likely of a slim build.

In efforts to identify the child, examiners took his footprints and compared them to those taken from other children from a local hospital and none apparently matched. = Coos County John Doe = The skeleton of a man between the ages of 50 and 80 was discovered on August 26, 1972, in Bandon, Coos County, Oregon. He had been killed by two gunshots; both were located on the skull, which still contained the bullets. The victim had died between 1967 and 1969, as the condition of his remains indicated. At the scene, which was near highway 101, three coins and two unfired bullets were found along with the man's clothing and dentures. He wore a hat, socks made from wool, a car key on a ring, a belt and a pair of leather boots which had white soles. It is possible that his dentures may have been from a local establishment serving veterans in 1966, as inscriptions on them indicated. In 2007, the DNA of the \\"John Doe\\" was tested against the family members of missing Idaho man Fred Miller; however there was no match. = Marion County John Doe (1980) = On July 18, 1980, a man's body was found on the side of Interstate 5 in Salem, Oregon. He had been strangled to death with a ligature only two to three hours earlier. He was between 35 and 45 years old, was 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed 160 pounds. He had balding brown hair, a mustache, and blue eyes. He was found wearing a red T-shirt, Wrangler blue jeans, socks, and leather moccassin toe boots with the laces missing. He is believed to be a victim of serial killer Randy Steven Kraft, and his death may be referred to as \\"Portland Elk\\" on Kraft's infamous scorecard. = Linn County John Doe = On October 23, 2006, the skeletal remains of a young to middle aged white man were found in a shallow grave near Big Springs Snow Park, north of Santiam Junction, Oregon. Cause of death could not be determined but was deemed a homicide due to the circumstances. He was estimated to be between 25 and 45 years old and was between 5 feet 7 inches and 6 feet 1 inch tall. His weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. He was described as having a robust build, and was suffering from spondylolsis, which would have caused him pain. He had had little to no dental work done during his life and his teeth were in bad condition. He was found wearing a gray T-shirt with a logo, black denim pants, blue nylon athletic pants with black trim and white leather shoes. Isotope testing done by Parabon Nanolabs indicated that he may have been from Texas, Florida, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. He may have been living a transient lifestyle shortly before his death.  Pennsylvania   Rhode Island  = Providence County John Doe = Providence County John Doe The Providence County John Doe is a man whose decomposing body was found floating in a pond on June 18, 1987, in Smithfield, Providence County, Rhode Island. The victim had received 21 stab wounds to his head and chest, possibly inflicted by an ice pick. His body was weighted down by rocks and barbells that were enclosed around his remains with chicken wire. The decedent is believed to have died a week to three weeks before his body surfaced. A forensic examination of his remains indicated he may have been Hispanic, aged between 25 and 35, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was five feet five inches tall and weighed approximately 122 pounds. The decedent wore a mustache and beard, and his hairline was receding. He was found wearing a black shirt, gray sweatpants and shoes, although he wore no socks.  South Carolina  = Sumter County Does = A young man and woman whose bodies were found on August 9, 1976. Both are believed to have hailed from a wealthy background, possibly in French Canada. Each victim had been shot three times and both had died within 24 hours prior to their discovery. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identifying both victims in July, 2019. = Aiken County Jane Does = On November 16, 1987, the remains of a mixed-race woman of predominantly African and possibly Asian or East Indian heritage were found in Aiken County, South Carolina. The cause of death was not determined, but the bodies of two homicide victims were found within a half-mile of the same location, one in 1991 and one in 1993. The deceased had a visible overbite and analysis of her hair indicated that she used cocaine. She was estimated to have been dead for between one and five years, and to have been between the ages of 17 and 25 at the time of her death. She was between 5 feet 8 and 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed between 150 and 160 pounds. On January 25, 1993, the body of another unidentified woman was found in the same vicinity. She was aged between twenty-five and thirty-two, stood between 5 feet 4 and 5 feet 7 inches tall, and died from a stab wound to the back of the neck. Like the previous victim, she had protruding teeth and wore no clothing; unlike the previous victim, her body had been burned. She was estimated to have been dead for around one to three years. Convicted serial killer Henry Louis Wallace has been questioned in relation to these deaths, as he confessed to murdering black women in North and South Carolina in the relevant timeframe. However, no charges have been brought. = Beaufort County Jane Doe = The body of a Hispanic or biracial woman was found strangled on May 24, 1995, in Yemassee, Beaufort County, South Carolina. Although the body was found laying face down, postmortem lividity indicated that it had been face-up for at least the first twelve hours after death, indicating that some time had passed between the death and disposal of the body. The victim had been between 30 and 35 years old, tall, and weighed ; both ears were pierced twice, and two earrings were present in each. She had scars from thyroid surgery and a caesarean section, and had undergone a hysterectomy. Her hair was naturally brown but was dyed red. She was nude except for panties. = Startex Jane Doe = The skeletonized remains of a white female were discovered by a group of teenagers on October 26, 2011, in a wooden area near Highway 290 in Startex, South Carolina. She was estimated to be between 40 to 55 years old and stood at 5 feet 5 inches with an indeterminate weight. She had short reddish-brown hair and both ears had been pierced at least once. A gold stem earring with a red stone was found near her head. Investigators determined that she was killed through homicidal violence and then buried under debris at the site. The DNA Doe Project was enlisted to assist with identifying the body in May, 2020.  Tennessee  = Maury County Jane Doe = Clothing found with the Maury County Jane Doe On February 14, 1975, the virtually skeletonized remains of a black woman between the ages of 15 and 25 years were discovered in Maury County, Tennessee. Her body was found near a highway, leading investigators to believe that she may not have been a native of Tennessee. An examination of the decedent's body indicated she most likely died six to nine months prior to the discovery of her body, thus making the most likely time of her death in the spring or summer of 1974. She was 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches in height, and weighed between 127 and 137 pounds. She wore a red top decorated with a seashell design, blue pants with a floral design, undergarments, and wedgie shoes. Her hair was black and kinky; her eye color could not be determined. Her autopsy also noted a distinctive dental trait: she had an extra tooth in her upper jaw. The victim had received several bone fractures during her life; two of which were fully healed at the time of her death. The unhealed fractures of the decedent were found in her pelvis and ribs. It is possible the decedent was either the victim of a car accident or had been intentionally run down by a car, as her unhealed bone injuries and the location of her body suggest. The remains of a young dog were also found near her body, but it is not known if she owned the animal. The skull of Maury County Jane Doe was reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2012. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with her identification in September, 2020. = Davidson County Jane Doe (1976) = Mortuary photograph of Davidson County Jane Doe The body of a teenage Hispanic or Native American girl was discovered on March 24, 1976, in Nashville, Tennessee. She had died of drowning approximately one day prior to her discovery under unknown, but suspicious circumstances. She was 5 feet 2 inches in height and weighed between 120 and 130 pounds. This girl's age is estimated to be between 14 and 17 years old and she had large breasts for her age and a mole near her left temple. She also had scars on both arms which may have been caused by cigarette burns. Prior to her death, Davidson County Jane Doe had been seen in the company of another girl who was never located; according to witnesses who had seen the two together, the deceased had called herself a name phonetically sounding like \\"Sherry\\" or \\"Cheryl\\", and both girls claimed that they had run away from a treatment center in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were heading to Haines City, Florida. Her traveling companion was a white teenage girl with sandy-blonde hair and who wore wire-rimmed glasses. = Cheatham County Jane Doe = On March 31, 1985, the skeletonized body of a red-haired white female believed to be between the ages of thirty-one and forty was found in Pleasant View, Cheatham County, Tennessee. She was between five and tall. Her weight could not be determined. An examination of her teeth showed some evidence of crowding and overlapping. She is believed to have died three to five months previously. The murders may have continued until 1992. = Campbell County Jane Doe (1985) = On April 3, 1985, the skeletonized partial remains of a young girl were discovered about 200 yards off Big Wheel Gap Road, four miles southwest of Jellico, Campbell County, Tennessee, near a strip mine. She was believed to have been dead between one and four years. Her age was estimated between 9 and 15. She was found by a passerby. A necklace and bracelet made of plastic buttons were found nearby, as well as a pair of size 5 boots and a few scraps of clothing. These items may or may not belong to her. Recent forensic analysis of the victim's remains indicated she was not native to the area where she was discovered. The tests showed she was likely born in Florida or central Texas, and had later lived in the Midwest, Rocky Mountain states, the Southwest or the Pacific Coast. = Campbell County Jane Doe (1998) = alt= The body of a black female was discovered on October 25, 1998. She had received a gunshot wound to the head, several stab wounds and her body also revealed evidence of her having been beaten prior to her death. She was aged between 30 and 40, was five feet six inches in height and weighed 130 pounds. She had died days prior to her discovery. According to her forensic examination, Campbell County Jane Doe had an extra tooth visible on the right side of her mouth and also had several impacted teeth, giving her a distinct smile. Forensic facial reconstructions of this decedent were screened on Good Morning America in 2004 in an attempt to generate leads as to her identity, but no sufficient clues were generated via this initiative. The woman's body was exhumed in March 2015 to extract DNA from her remains. = Davidson County Jane Doe (1998) = left On March 19, 1998, the body of a white female between the ages of 45 and 55 was discovered in the Cumberland River in Nashville. She had been shot twice in the head approximately one day before her body was located, and her body was dressed in athletic pants, underwear and one Reebok shoe. She wore jewelry, including a gold necklace with a Leo zodiac pendant and two rings; one of which was gold and the other black. The victim was overweight for her height, weighing 167 pounds at her height of five feet two inches. Her teeth had been extensively cared for in life: dental work valued at approximately $10,000 was visible on her teeth, indicating she likely hailed from a higher socioeconomic class. Her hair was brown with highlights and her eyes were green. A man had been seen in the company of this woman prior to her death inside a store; he had worn the same pendant as her. This individual was never located. In 2011, the decedent's DNA was entered into national forensic databases, although no matches have been made with her remains. = Anderson County Jane Doe = On March 6, 2000, the decomposed and nude remains of a young white female were discovered by two fishermen floating in Melton Lake in Oakridge, Tennessee. She was found to have drowned, but investigators have not ruled out a homicide due to her being nude. She had died a few weeks before being found. She was estimated to be between 24 and 35 years old and was 5 feet 9 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. She had pierced ears and possible signs of scoliosis. Her teeth were also well cared for. The body of water in which the woman was found is a reservoir of the Clinch River, leading investigators to believe that her body may have flowed to where she was found, about a quarter mile downstream from Knox County. Investigators believe she may have been the victim of a kidnapping, and may have disappeared in February of 2000. = Blount County Jane Doe = On March 25, 2003, surveyors found the scattered skeletal remains of a young, African American female in a drainage creek in Alcoa, Tennessee, an area close to the Knox Airport. Later searches in December uncovered additional remains. Investigators believe that she may possibly be a victim of a truck driver serial killing. She is believed to have been deceased for anywhere between 8 months and 4 years. She was estimated to be between 17 and 25 years old, and between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 10 inches tall. She had black hair and synthetic braids possibly woven into her hair. She was found wearing a sleeveless tank top with the phrase \\"I don't need a great deal of love, just a steady supply\\", a blue fleece hoodie jacket, and a waistband. She may have possibly worked in the health care industry. = Chattanooga-Birchwood John Doe = On August 29, 2006, a group of hunters found the body of a middle aged white male near Chickamauga Lake in Birchwood, Tennessee. His body had been concealed in a black plastic bags, leading investigators to believe that he was killed through homicidal means. He had been dead for over two months. He was between 40 and 55 years old, was approximately 5 feet 11 inches tall, and weighed between 160 and 210 pounds. He had brown hair, a surgical scar on his right elbow, no upper teeth, and a compressed disc in his lower back which may have caused back issues. He was found wearing a Gray T-shirt with the Tom and Jerry characters on it, blue jeans, light colored cotton socks, white sneakers, and a light colored bandanna. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identifying the man in December, 2018. = Rutherford County Jane Doe = The skeleton of a woman of African heritage was discovered on November 14, 2007, in La Vergne, Rutherford County. She had been murdered approximately four months prior to her discovery, and her clothing had been removed. Although the actual cause of Rutherford County Jane Doe's death has not been conclusively determined, her hands and feet had been bound with yard trimmer cords. This decedent was approximately five feet six inches in height and aged between her mid 20s and mid 30s; her hair was short and brown. Her teeth also revealed she had undergone dental surgery in her lifetime. She wore two bracelets (one of which contained pictures) and a ring. Although this decedent is believed to have been of African heritage, investigators cannot exclude the possibility she may have been biracial. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identification in April, 2020.  Texas   Vermont  = Addison County victims = The skeletonized remains of three individuals: a female adult; a male child; and a teenager whose sex remains undetermined, were discovered in Middlebury, Vermont on May 15, 1935. Each victim had been shot in the head between one and three years prior to their discovery. The adult female's DNA showed she may have been the mother of the teenage victim, but testing of the youngest victim was inconclusive. The female was estimated to be aged between 35 and 45; the male child aged between nine and 11, and the teenager between 13 and 15 at the time of his or her death. At the crime scene, investigators recovered feathers from a pillow and pearl buttons presumed to belong to pajamas. Facial reconstructions of the oldest and youngest victims were created in 2015.  Virginia  = Fairfax County John Doe = On June 13, 1972, the nude body of a boy of African heritage aged between three and six years old was found in Massey Creek, Virginia. He was four feet tall, weighed just 50 pounds, and had been dead less than 24 hours. The cause of death was determined to be multiple blows to the head. FBI Reconstruction of Rockingham County Jane Doe = Rockingham County Jane Doe = On November 14, 1980, the skeletal remains of a young white female was found, partially buried in a shallow grave in the George Washington National Forest in Rockingham County, Virginia. Investigators believe foul play was involved, and that she may have been deceased for up to sixteen years, as a coin with the year 1964 was found with her remains. She was estimated to be between 20 and 30 years old and was between 5 feet and 5 feet 5 inches tall, and may have given birth at least once. Her weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. She was found wearing a silk slip, white stockings, garter straps and a heart shaped necklace. Some speculated in 2008 that she was missing woman Georgia Nolan, however this was later ruled out. FBI Reconstruction of Hanover County John Doe = Hanover County John Doe = On February 23, 1982, the decomposed remains of a young/middle aged white/Hispanic man were found in a thicket on the side of Interstate 95, north of Doswell, Virginia.

His time of death was estimated as approximately 24 hours prior to being found and his cause of death was determined to be homicide by ligature strangulation. His height was 5'2\\" to 5'3\\" and he weighed from 100 to 120 pounds. He was wearing a tan, long sleeve dress shirt with thin white stripes in boy's size 6, John Henry brand and boys size 12, Fruit of the Loom briefs. Tattoos on fingers of left hand; middle finger \\"9\\"; ring finger \\"6\\"; little finger possible \\"1\\". = Rockbridge County John Doe = The decomposing body of a white male was found on May 27, 1987, in Rockbridge County, Virginia. He was estimated to be between 20 and 40 years of age (most likely being aged in his early twenties). The decedent's hair was brown and he was approximately five feet four inches tall. He was presumed to have been nearsighted, as he wore plastic-framed glasses to treat the condition, issued by a Veterans Administration. The decedent's possessions included a switchblade along with a cross necklace, ten dollars and twelve cents, a cassette tape, memo pad, a lighter, and a pen. His clothing included a short- sleeved shirt, blue jeans, white socks with yellow and green stripes, a brown belt with paint-spattering, brown shoes, and a coat. The man had been killed by two gunshot wounds by a man named John Swartz, who has since been convicted of his murder. The victim had allegedly been picked up at a truck stop by Swartz and had informed Swartz his name was Chris. Swartz had paid the decedent to assist him with unloading cargo, which he then used to buy several items. After Swartz had picked up a second shipment, 'Chris' requested more money along with some of the items in the vehicle, threatening Swartz with the knife he had purchased with his initial payment. This physical threat was accompanied by a verbal threat of informing authorities he had an \\"unauthorized passenger\\" inside his vehicle. After he had taken contact information that was later discovered in his pockets, Swartz eventually killed the man and proceeded with his shipment. = Fairfax County Jane Doe = Reconstruction of Fairfax County Jane Doe Construction workers discovered the skeletal remains of a 26 to 31-year-old woman in a shallow grave in Centreville, Fairfax County on December 6, 1993. The woman had been stabbed to death, most likely in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Multiple articles of clothing were found with her body, as well as a clip-on button earring. In addition, she was wearing dark pink nail polish on her fingernails. Fairfax County Jane Doe was estimated to be between five feet and five feet three inches in height and had \\"dark blond to brown hair\\". The dental care she had received was relatively poor as many of her teeth were in an advanced state of decay. She is presumed to be white, although it is possible that she may have been Hispanic. = \\"Baby Hope\\" = On December 21, 1996, a custodian at the Lillian Vernon mail order warehouse in Virginia Beach, Virginia discovered the body of a newborn, Asian infant, hanging from a plastic bag inside of the woman's locker room. Investigators believe that the child was born inside of the facility, as the facility had substantial security. The newborn was 19 inches tall and weighed 5 to 6 pounds. She was found wrapped in a red golf shirt, with a crest on the shirt with the words \\"Sport, Athletic, Champion\\". Investigators found that 4000 employees were working at the warehouse when the body was found, and have tested multiple women's DNA, with no results. In 2017, Parabon Nanolabs determined that the child was of East Asian descent. Her parents may have been of Cambodian, Dai, Lahu, Thai, Vietnamese, or Filippino descent.  Washington  = Yakima County Jane Doe (1977) = On July 25, 1977, the decomposed body of a young white female was discovered in the back of an abandoned green van behind the old Yakima Hardware Company parking lot in Yakima, Washington. The van had not been driven for months by the owner, and the rear door was found to be latched, not locked. She had been struck with a blunt object in the face, strangled, sexually mutilated, and then dropped off in the abandoned van. She was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old, was between 5 feet 3 and 5 feet 9 inches tall, and weighed between 120 and 160 pounds. She had brown hair and brown eyes, as well as a small five pointed star tattooed on her inner-right thigh. She was only wearing a pair of socks, but a green sweater, a yellow handmade dress, a blue shirt, some blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of black boots were found on top of or near the body. A pair of white panties was found outside of the van. A tip came in to investigators stating that the woman was a West Valley resident who was seeking a divorce while living with her boyfriend. Another stated that they had seen the young woman at a cafe, and spent a lot of time with a members of a motorcycle gang. The woman was exhumed in 2004 for fingerprints and tissue samples to be sent to the FBI, which turned up no results. = Pierce County Jane Doe (1978) = On August 29, 1978, the skull of a teenage white female was found by a pair of fishermen near the Mashell River, southwest from Eatonville, Washington. Investigators believe she may have been a victim of a homicide. She was estimated to be between 15 and 20 years old and was 5 feet 7 inches tall. She had long brown hair with blonde highlights. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. She was most likely a smoker. She was found wearing a blue sweater with pink shoulders and a zipper, a multi-colored T-shirt with a button front, blue denim pants, a green windbreaker jacket with inside pockets, panties, and a pair of blue sneakers with white chevron. A Marlboro cigarette pack was also found. It has long been speculated that she may be Donna Gail Manson, a victim of Ted Bundy, who disappeared in 1974 from Olympia, Washington and wore similar clothing. Conclusive identification is implausible, if not impossible now though, due to her remains and clothing being destroyed in 1985 and the coroner records missing. = Spokane County Jane Doe = Rendering of the Spokane County Jane Doe On June 20, 1984, the nude remains of a woman were found in the Spokane River in Spokane County, Washington. Initially believed to be aged between 16 and 30, a further examination conducted in 1998 indicated that she was actually aged between 16 and 35 years old at the time of her death. The decedent was white, around five feet five inches in height and weighed approximately 130 pounds. She had two prominent moles on her neck, and is known to have suffered from a minor case of spina bifida. She also had a scar on both her left arm and on one of her knees. Her body was extensively dismembered, with her head, hands and feet being severed from her body. A separate hand was located around the time of the discovery of her torso, but was determined not to have belonged to the decedent. She is known to have borne at least one child during her life. Her head was not located until 1998, which was matched with the DNA of the victim. She had suffered a blow to the face, which had caused fractures to her skull. Additionally, sharp force trauma was found on the side of the head. Several reconstructions have been created of Spokane County Jane Doe's face. = Green River victims = On March 21, 1984, the body of a teenage female was found in Seattle, Washington. She had died at least ten months before her discovery and was aged between 12 and 18. She was most likely left-handed, and a healed fracture was also observed on her skull. Gary Ridgway described her as a white female in her early twenties who may have had brown hair. On January 2, 1986, the body of another female was found in Auburn, King County, Washington. She was aged between 14 and 19 and had lain undiscovered for between two and six years. A third Green River victim also remains unidentified. Her remains were discovered in August 2003. Due to the recovered remains being partial, no option exists to reconstruct her face, although she is believed to have been aged between 13 and 24. Ridgway described this victim as a white female in her mid-teens or early twenties with blond or brown hair and around 135 pounds in weight. These three victims remain known as Jane Doe B-10, Jane Doe B-17 and Jane Doe B-20, respectively. Most, though not all, of the Green River Killer's victims who have been identified were involved in prostitution. = Yakima County Jane Doe (1988) = On February 16, 1988, the skeletal remains of a young Native American female were found on a dirt road tribal land near the Parker Dam in Yakima County, Washington. Investigators do not believe she was part of the Yakima Nation. Investigators also suspect she may be a victim of John Bill Fletcher Jr., a serial rapist who had committed two murders in the area. She was estimated to be between 26 and 40 years old and was approximately 5 feet tall. She had black/dark brown hair which was bleached lighter, and high cheekbones. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained, but she was described as having a petite build. She was found wearing lavender pants, a long sleeved shirt with a Mexican label, and brown \\"Bowling type\\" shoes. It was announced in December, 2018, that her remains would be exhumed for DNA testing. = Spokane County John Doe = On July 3, 1989, a bulldozer working at a county dump unearthed the decomposing remains of a middle aged white male. Cause of death could not be ascertained, however homicide is suspected due to the circumstances. He was estimated to be between 40 and 65 years old and approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall. Weight, hair color, and eye color could not be ascertained. He was found to have 3 tattoos, one on the right bicep of a green, black, and white snake design, one on the right forearm of a snake and a tree branch with green leaves, and an animal head, possibly a panther, and one on his left forearm of an eagle, a portion of a tree top and a mountain. He was found wearing a pair of bluish-green slacks with an elastic waist band. Investigators believe the man may have been dumped by a dump truck at the landfill about two to three weeks prior. = Grays Harbor County Jane Doe = On October 24, 1988, a group of mushroom hunters discovered the skeletal remains of a young Native American/Asian American woman on a logging road in Elma, Washington.

She was estimated to be between 22 and 40 years old, was between 4 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 2 inches tall, and weighed 100 pounds. She had dark brown hair and a medium to stocky build. She was found wearing a blue shirt, black pants, a white multi-colored blouse with a floral pattern, dark blue slip on shoes, a gold earring with five sapphires, and a pearl with silver setting ring. Investigators believe she was of Southeast-Asian descent, as the county had a large population of transient Cambodian refugees during the times. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identifying the woman in March, 2020. = Pierce County John Doe (1989) = On March 18, 1989, a hiker discovered the skeletal remains of a young white male in a wooded area of Carbon River Canyon in rural Pierce County, Washington. He had been stabbed in the chest once and had been deceased for at least a year. He was estimated to be between 17 and 24 years old, was approximately 6 feet tall and weighed between 150 and 160 pounds. He had brown hair and a narrow jaw, as well as an extra vertebra and an extra right rib which may have caused back pain. He was found wearing a pair of Levi jeans, a T-shirt with a picture of a lion and the words \\"SINGHA\\", \\"lager beer\\" and \\"Boon Rawd Brewery Bangkok\\", blue and white sneakers with Velcro, Fruit of the Loom underwear, white socks with faded horizontal stripes, and a long sleeve button down shirt with purple buttons. The shirt was noted to have been popular with soldiers in the late 1980s. His body was exhumed in 2014 for DNA collection and to make a facial reconstruction. = Lewis County Jane Doe (2011) = On April 7, 2011, the partial skeletal remains of a young African American female were found along a logging trail by a passing motorist in Morton, Washington. She had been deceased for three months, and had possibly been moved from another burial site. She was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old. Hair color and eye color are not conclusively known, but are believed to be black and brown, respectively, based on DNA phenotyping by Parabon Nanolabs. She was initially believed to be Caucasian until this phenotyping proved she was of Somali or East African descent. She may possibly be a victim of serial killer, Israel Keyes.  West Virginia  = Morgan County Jane Doe = On May 10, 1950, the nude body of a white female was discovered in Morgan County, West Virginia. She had been strangled to death within 48 hours prior to her discovery, with her body being discarded in a wooded area close to the state border of Maryland. She was estimated to be between the ages of 35 and 50 at the time of her death. The victim had reddish hair in a perm, was approximately five feet five inches tall, and weighed between 125 and 135 pounds. The victim had several distinctive scars on her body; one shaped like the letter \\"w\\" on her forehead; and another shaped like the letter \\"y\\" on one of her wrists. A scar from a hysterectomy and an appendectomy were also present. Her hands were noticeably small, and she had freckles on the back of both hands and on her arms. Despite the fact the decedent was found shortly after her death, her eye color is unknown. In 2007, the body was exhumed to obtain DNA information in efforts to determine her identity. = Wetzel County Jane Doe = The naked body of a white female was found alongside Route 250 near Littleton, in Wetzel County, West Virginia in February 1983. A pair of senior citizens reported the body, which they originally had thought was a display mannequin. The body had been placed at the area recently, as snow was on the ground but not on the body. Police said that tire tracks and footprints nearby indicated that she was likely transported to this site after death from another location. Their examination concluded she had died about two days previously, and was not a victim of sexual assault.  Wisconsin  = \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\" = left A young boy, estimated to be between five and seven years old, whose body was found in a pond near the O'Laughlin Stone Company in Waukesha, Wisconsin on March 8th, 1921. He may have been in the water for several months, and had been struck on the head. He had blond hair, brown eyes and a missing tooth, and was dressed in a gray sweater, Munsing underwear, black stockings, a blouse and patent leather shoes; the clothing quality suggested the child was from an affluent family. = Jackson County John Doe (1978) = On August 15, 1978, a group of loggers found the bones of a middle aged man near Knapp Township, Wisconsin. His skull, lower mandible, and various vertebrae were found. Cause of death could not be ascertained, but was deemed a homicide based on the circumstances. He was estimated to be between 28 and 52 years old. Most other details could not be ascertained with what little bones were found, however it is believed that he may have had a pierced ear, due to a silver Medi-Stud earring being found close by. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identification of the remains in May 2019. = Columbia County Jane Doe = Columbia County Jane Doe The skeletal remains of a woman were found in Caledonia, Columbia County, Wisconsin on May 8, 1982. The body was found in a wooded area near Highway 78. It is believed that she had died elsewhere and was disposed of at that location. The victim and her murderer may not have been local to the area where the body was discovered as her body was found near a highway, indicating that her body may have been transported to the location from elsewhere in the United States. The victim, aged 45 to 65 and most likely white, had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the skull. She had likely borne at least one child before her death. There was evidence of arthritis in her neck and back, and this may have affected the way she walked. Because of the degree of decomposition of the body, the hair color, eye color, weight, and complexion of the victim are unknown. However, some details could be assessed. Her height is estimated to be 5 feet 5 to 5 feet 7 inches tall. The victim's dental characteristics were fairly unusual, as the partial denture and crowns in her mouth were said to have been out of the ordinary. No clothing was found at the body disposal site except for a multicolored blouse and size 12 brown pants. She was buried in Wyocena, Wisconsin, on September 1, 1987, after her case went cold, but her body was exhumed in April 2014. The remains were transported to Virginia for additional testing, including DNA profiling. Since the case was reopened and reintroduced to the public eye, tips as to her identity have been submitted to the authorities. The DNA Doe Project was asked to help assist with identifying her in March, 2020. = Vernon County Jane Doe = Facial reconstruction of Vernon County Jane Doe Vernon County Jane Doe is a woman aged between 50 and 65 years old who had been killed by blunt-force trauma to her head, forceful enough to break her dentures, approximately 24-48 hours before her body was discovered on the night of May 4th, 1984 near the town of Westby. Her hands had been severed from her arms to prevent identification by fingerprinting. =\\"Chimney Crossdresser\\"= The skeletal remains of a lightly-built Caucasian male between the ages of 22 and 27 were discovered in the now-defunct 'Good N Loud' music store on University Avenue in Madison on September 3, 1989, when the owner pulled a vent pipe from the brickwork in an attempt to find the source of a blockage that was causing water seepage. He was wearing a paisley dress, a black, long sleeved White Stag blouse, an Iron cross necklace, and a 'shag' sweater, and had brown hair and a slight overbite. He was carrying a butter knife, a spare pair of socks and a comb at the time of his death, and was not wearing underwear. His pelvis had been broken, possibly in the process of forcing him into the chimney, and he may have been there for two months to two years. He may have worked as a page in the state Legislature sometime between 1977 and 1985. = St. Croix County Jane Doe = The skull of a woman aged 35 to 60 years was found in an advanced stage of decomposition on October 21, 2002, near Houlton, St. Croix County, Wisconsin. She had been dead for approximately one year before her skull was found. The skull had been placed in a garbage bag, which was disposed of near Anderson Scout Camp Road, where it was later discovered by Boy Scouts. No other parts of her body have been found. The woman had dark brown hair, no teeth, and may have been of mixed race. Examination of the skull indicated that she may have had a mental disability. She may also have had \\"different looking\\" features, such as wide- set eyes and a flat nose. She may have been living in a group home, as her condition may have been severe. = Fond du Lac County Jane Doe = A teenage or young adult woman, believed to be between 15 and 21 years old when she died, who was found frozen in a creek on November 23, 2008. She had a distinctive overbite, may have been pigeon-toed or knock-kneed, and was not wearing shoes or socks. She had shoulder-length light brown hair, possibly with highlights, and weighed approximately 120 pounds. Isotope testing indicated she originated from New Mexico or Arizona and had lived in the Midwest for a year or less before her death.  Wyoming  = \\"Bitter Creek Betty\\" = Artist's impression of how Bitter Creek Betty may have appeared during life The nude body of a \\"white\\" female was discovered on March 1, 1992, in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The decedent's body is believed to have been discarded at the location of her discovery approximately one month prior, although due to the cold weather, her body was well preserved. She was between 24 and 32 years of age, and between five feet six and five feet eight inches in height. She had a scar from a Caesarean section on her abdomen as well as a tattoo of a rose beneath one of her breasts. At the crime scene, a golden- appearing necklace and ring, sweatpants and pink underwear were found. After images of the victim's tattoo were published throughout the United States, a man came forward claiming that he had performed the tattoo on the woman. This man claimed that she was Hispanic, lacking any discernible accent, and was likely a drifter who hitchhiked frequently around the country. Later genetic testing would also determine the woman was of possible Hispanic and European descent. This unidentified decedent is also known as \\"Rose Doe\\". The woman had died from being stabbed through one of the nostrils, having also been strangled and beaten, likely at another location. She had also been sexually assaulted both anally and vaginally prior to her murder. Multiple missing persons have been ruled out as possible identities of Bitter Creek Betty. Apart from this victim, two other decedents from the area also remain unidentified. DNA from the scene has also matched another murder, indicating she was murdered by a serial killer. In May 2020, a long-haul trucker from Iowa, Clark Perry Baldwin, was arrested and charged with her killing, as well as those of two other women in Wyoming and Tennessee. = Sheridan County Jane Doe = Reconstruction of the Sheridan County Jane Doe A female aged 16 to 21 was discovered murdered on April 13, 1992, in Sheridan County, Wyoming. DNA from the scene was eventually matched to that found at the site of Bitter Creek Betty's body. Unlike the previous victim, the body of this decedent was too decomposed to identify visually and her eye color could not be determined. The cause of her death was ruled as blunt force trauma to the head. She was white, five feet five to five feet six inches tall, 110 to 115 pounds and had brown hair with a wavy texture. It is believed that she was murdered at a different area than where her body was discovered. The victim's clothing consisted of a patterned white and light blue top that had ties underneath the bust, with pearl and jewel-like buttons. The female also wore a bra, blue jeans, pink underwear and brass earrings. In May 2020, a long-haul trucker from Iowa, Clark Perry Baldwin, was arrested and charged with her killing, as well as those of two other women in Wyoming and Tennessee.

Topera's headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California. The company uses 3D analysis and mapping to detect the sources of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia to identify targets for catheter ablation. History In 2010, Dr. Sanjiv Narayan and Dr. Ruchir Sehra founded Topera in San Diego, California . Narayan founded the company to commercialize the technology he developed which maps irregular heartbeats. Prior to founding the company, he had collected cardiac electrophysiological data from patients and wrote software to code and analyze collected data. He conducted clinical studies to prove that conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) plus targeting and ablating rotors and focal impulses would increase the success rate of single procedure atrial fibrillation ablations. His training includes a master's degree in software engineering, a clinical fellowship at Harvard Medical School, and a position as a faculty tutor for the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology program. In 2011, Topera opened an office in Lexington, Massachusetts. Edward Kerslake, former corporate vice president of Boston Scientific became the CEO of Topera in 2010. In 2011, the firm created a management advisory board. In 2012, the FDA cleared Topera's 3D mapping and analysis system, RhythmView. The system was presented at the Heart Rhythm Society's 2012 scientific sessions in Boston, Massachusetts. =Funding= The company raised $2.75 million in its seed funding round in 2012; A few months later, it received an additional $3.77 million in partial close funding. In May 2013, the company closed on $25 million in a C series of funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Products Topera developed a 3D mapping tool to assists physicians in identifying the electrical source of complex cardiac arrhythmias. The FIRMap catheter, used with the RhythmView workstation, received CE clearance and FDA clearance in 2013. The tip of the catheter has a spherical wire basket that has 64 evenly placed electrodes over the 8 splines that make up the basket. The basket expands, capturing the contours of the heart chambers and creating a panoramic map of the electrical heart activity. This information is sent to the workstation and creates a near real-time 3D reconstruction of the heart and its electrophysiological activity. The data from the workstation is used to help diagnose the source of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia. Prior to the company's FIRMap catheter being commercially available, the workstation was compatible with other multi-polar mapping catheters. The Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation procedure decreases procedure times and reduces re-ablation rates by targeting the source of arrhythmia. Clinical trials Narayan and six other independent clinical investigators performed clinical trials that followed post-ablation procedure patients for a year. Published as a comprehensive study in August 2012, the trials showed that 88 percent of the patients in the trial who received the FIRM (Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation) procedure had a successful termination or slowing of their atrial fibrillation. Long-term success was achieved in 82 percent of patients with a single FIRM procedure. Ten centers reported that Topera Medical's FIRM mapping system identifies patient specific sources of atrial fibrillation (rotors), and that ablation of the rotors improves treatment success with a single procedure. A second, broader clinical study at ten centers independently confirmed the findings of the first study with a success rate of 80.5% where FIRM was used. The first and second set of trials reported success after the patients were followed for one year. At the beginning of 2014, three-year results showed a success rate of 78% compared to the traditional PVI success rate of 39%. Other published studies have shown that rotors are located in both atria of the heart and in locations that are not targeted and ablated in traditional procedures. Eliminating rotors increases success rates, even in patients with whom traditional techniques are less successful because of pre-existing conditions such as persistent atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, or body mass index. Published studies reporting success rates with Topera's FIRM-guided ablations are based on single procedure results, while other published reports reflect the outcome of multiple ablation procedures. For this reason it is difficult to compare relative success rates. One study reported success rates after a single, as well as those after multiple, procedures. The cumulative long-term success after a mean of 2 procedures was 63% while long-term success after single-procedure was only 29%.

The 6,825-ton vessel sent a distress signal from about north of Byeongpungdo at 08:58 KST (23:58 UTC, 15 April 2014). Out of 476 passengers and crew, 304 died in the disaster, including around 250 students from Danwon High School (Ansan City). Of the approximately 172 survivors, more than half were rescued by fishing boats and other commercial vessels that arrived at the scene approximately 40 minutes before the Korea Coast Guard. The sinking of MV Sewol resulted in widespread social and political reaction within South Korea. Many criticized the actions of the captain and most of the crew. Also criticized were the ferry operator and the regulators who oversaw its operations, along with the administration of President Park Geun-hye for its disaster response (including the poor showing of the coast guard) and attempts to downplay government culpability. On 15 May 2014, the captain and three crew members were charged with murder, while the other eleven members of the crew were indicted for abandoning the ship. An arrest warrant was also issued for Yoo Byung-eun, the owner of Chonghaejin Marine, which operated Sewol, but he could not be found despite a nationwide manhunt. On 22 July 2014, police revealed that they had established that a dead man found in a field south of Seoul was Yoo. Background Sewol at a port in Incheon in March 2014, after modifications had been made At the time of its purchase by Chonghaejin Marine in 2012, the ship that would come to be known as MV Sewol was eighteen years old and dilapidated. She was originally named Ferry Naminoue and was operated from 1994 to 2012 as a transport ship for cargo and passengers by the Japanese company A-Line Ferry. According to A-Line Ferry, it did not experience any problems during its service in Japan. After it was purchased on 8 October 2012, it underwent modifications between 12 October 2012 and 12 February 2013, and was registered by Chonghaejin on 22 October 2012. The modifications were later found to have been based on an illegal redesign of the ship. After these modifications, which included the addition of two decks of passenger space and the expansion of the cargo space, Sewol had her gross tonnage increased by 239 tons to 6,825 tons and her passenger capacity increased by 116 people for a total of 956 people including the crew. The modifications resulted in its center of gravity being moved upward by as well as a left-right imbalance. After the modifications were completed, it underwent investigations by the Korean Register of Shipping including an inclining test, and received the ship inspection certification and the certification for the prevention of sea pollution on 12 February 2013. During the process of approving the modifications, the Register reduced the maximum amount of cargo that could be carried by 1,450 tons to 987 tons, and increased the amount of ballast needed by 1,333 tons, to 1,703 tons. The cargo limits were not known by the Korea Shipping Association, which has the responsibility to manage ferries, or the Korea Coast Guard, which were responsible for overseeing the Shipping Association. The South Korean government's Board of Audit and Inspection later revealed that the Register's licensing was based on falsified documents. After the inspections, 37 tons of marble were further added to the gallery room at the bridge deck located on the back of the ship. Sewol began operations on 15 March 2013. She made three round trips per week from Incheon to Jeju, each one-way voyage of taking 13.5 hours to complete. On 19 February 2014, she received an interim inspection and a periodic inspection from the Register. It had made the round trip a total of 241 times until the day of the incident. Route of Sewol during the last voyage from Incheon to Jeju, the capsizing location marked by the rectangular speech bubble On 15 April 2014, Sewol was scheduled to leave the port at Incheon at 6:30 p.m., KST. A fog which restricted the visible distance to less than led the Incheon vessel traffic service (VTS) to issue a low visibility warning around 5:30 p.m., leading the Shipping Association to hold Sewols departure. The VTS retracted the warning around 8:35 p.m., and the Shipping Association removed the restriction on Sewols departure after checking the weather conditions with the operator of the Palmido lighthouse and consulting with the Korean Coast Guard. She departed around 9 p.m., and was the only ship to leave port that evening. When Sewol departed, she was carrying 443 passengers, 33 crew members, and a total of 2,142.7 tons of cargo including 185 cars. 325 of the passengers were students on a field trip from Danwon High School and five passengers were of non-Korean nationality. The ship was commanded by 69-year- old Captain Lee Joon-seok, who had been brought in as a replacement for the regular captain. He had over 40 years of experience at sea, and had traveled the route before. He was hired on a one-year contract, with a monthly salary of (roughly US$2,500). Lee worked with thirty-three crew members for the journey, of which nineteen were irregular, part-time workers. Later investigations discovered problems concerning the state of Sewol at the time of departure. Despite the ship's maximum allowance for 987 tons of cargo, Sewol was carrying 2,142.7 tons of cargo which had been improperly secured. Only 761.2 tons of ballast were taken on board, the ballast tanks had not been properly maintained, and the previous voyage was made without making further adjustments to the ballast during the journey. The regular captain of Sewol, Captain Shin, had warned Chonghaejin about the decrease in stability and attributed it to the removal of the side ramp, later claiming that the company threatened to fire him if he continued his objections. Shin's warnings were also relayed through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from Chonghaejin responded to by stating that he would deal with anyone making the claims. Shin had also requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, but this was not done. The Register had noted in a stability test report dated 24 January 2014 that Sewol had become 'too heavy and less stable after modifications were made.' Chonghaejin's budget for the safety training of the crew was US$2, which was used to buy a paper certificate. 16 April 2014 = Entering the Maenggol Channel (07:30‚Äì08:46) = A photograph of passengers and crew on the ship on the morning of 16 April On 16 April at 7:30 a.m. (KST), third mate Park Han- kyul and helmsman Cho Joon-ki took over the watch from the previous team. At this time, Sewol was heading at a course of about 165 degrees at a speed of about 20 knots, and was operating two radar devices. Around 8:20 a.m. when the ship was about 2‚Äì3 miles from entering the Maenggol Channel, Park ordered Cho to change the steering system from autopilot to manual steering. When Sewol arrived at the channel at 8:27 a.m. at a course of around 137 degrees, the wind speed was between 4 and 7 meters per second, the wave height about 0.5 meters, and the visibility good. The Maenggol Channel has strong underwater currents, which necessitate extreme caution when steering a ship through it. At the time of the incident, conditions were calm and Sewol was following a route that was frequently used. While the wider areas of the channel contain rock hazards and shallow waters, they were not in the immediate vicinity of the ship's usual path. While prosecutors and some news organizations labeled Park as being 'inexperienced' based on her unfamiliarity with the channel, the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal's investigation report noted that she had on multiple occasions passed through the channel on another ship. As Sewol approached the fatal turn, breakfast was being served in the cafeteria. CCTV data taken at 8:40 a.m. showed students present and socializing on the deck. One surviving passenger, Choi Eun-seun, recalled having gone up to the deck to smoke right before the incident. =Multiple turns to the right (08:48)= Right before the incident, Park and Cho were standing side by side near the ship's wheel at the bridge. Captain Lee was absent from the bridge at the time. At 8:46 a.m., as Sewol was travelling at a speed of eighteen knots at a course of around 136 degrees, Park ordered Cho to change the course from 135 degrees to 140 degrees, which Cho consequently undertook. There are conflicting accounts of what happened next. According to Park's testimony, after she had used the radar to check that Sewols course was changed and the current course was set to 140 degrees, she ordered Cho to change the course of the ship further to 145 degrees. The order was given at 8:48 a.m. After realizing that the ship was heavily listing to starboard, which led the bow to turn to the right, she gave an order to turn the wheel to port. Immediately after giving the order, she heard Cho exclaim \\"The wheel isn't working\\" in a flustered voice, after which the ship started listing. Cho's testimony did not notably differ from that of Park. He testified that the listing began with the order to turn to 140 degrees. According to Cho, he only received the order to change the course to 140 degrees, and not the order to change the course to 145 degrees. Because the ship kept turning towards the right even as he was holding onto the wheel, he made two turns to the left amounting to a 5-degree turn. Because the ship did not stop its rightward turning, it was eventually facing a 145-degree course. Cho testified that Park gave an order to turn \\"in the opposite direction\\" at this point, which he followed by turning the ship further to the left by 10 degrees, so the total amount of the turn became 15 degrees to the left. The court came to the conclusion that Cho's steering led the ship to attempt a 15-degree turn for 40 seconds. The court concluded that Cho, who was flustered by the ship turning faster than expected when he was following Park's order to turn to 145 degrees, was attempting to turn to the left when he took Park's order to mean a turn in the opposite direction. This led him to make a turn to the right, causing the front of the ship to rapidly turn right.  Effects of the turn  Later analysis of Sewols track chart by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revealed that the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) had stopped collecting data from 8:48:37 to 8:49:13; consequently, the Ministry and the Jindo VTS lost 36 and 29 seconds of data, respectively. While earlier reports and investigations believed that there was a power outage, Huh Yong-bum, the head of the expert advisory panel on the police-prosecution joint investigation team, testified that the AIS failure was due to system limitations and that the failure did not affect the steering. According to the joint investigation team, the sharp turn was a combined result produced by the steering error and the lessened restoring force caused by overloading; investigations did not show any malfunctions with the generator or the battery. From 8:49:26, AIS data showed Sewols angular velocity accelerated from 0.29 radians per second to 0.83, 1.00, and 2.00 until 8:49:39; these readings were consistent with previous testing data gained from earlier tests conducted on an empty Sewol. Consequently, the ship herself listed 20 degrees into the water on 8:49:40, causing cargo to fall to one side of the ship. The impact caused the ship's gyroscope to erroneously record angular velocities of 15 radians per second on 8:49:40, 14 on the next second, and ‚àí11 on the consequent second, and tilt the ship 10 degrees further into the water. Passengers also reported hearing a loud \\"bang.\\" As Cho sharply turned the wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect was that the ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling to one side of the ship caused Sewol to lose all her restoring force and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo loading bay and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. Cho testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off- duty helmsman who was sleeping in his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50 a.m., Sewol was leaning 30 degrees to port. Captain Lee, who was in his private cabin at the time of the incident, immediately rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, Cho stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it was on his own volition or following an order from Lee. At 8:50, Cho ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she was taken aback by the sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06 a.m. With the engines off, Sewol became unable to change directions and began drifting sideways. A passenger later testified that lights went out after the ferry started listing. =Calls for rescue (8:52‚Äì9:30)= As Sewol began sinking, the ferry's intercom system started ordering the passengers to stay put, alleging that moving was dangerous. The announcements were made by a communication officer, Kang Hae-seong, who had not consulted the manual before the broadcast. The announcements began broadcasting by at least 8:52 a.m. and continued even when water began flooding passenger compartments. Other crew members corroborated this order, instructing passengers to stay put. Captain Lee also instructed passengers to stay put and did not change the order even as he was leaving the ship. The first emergency call was made by Choi Duk-ha, a Danwon High School student aboard the ferry. At 8:52 a.m., he called the national emergency service number and reported to the Jeollanam-do fire station that Sewol was capsizing. Choi was connected to the Mokpo Coast Guard at 8:54 a.m. and was asked to give the latitude and longitude of the ship's location. Three minutes later, the Mokpo Coast Guard station situation room ordered Patrol Vessel No. 123 to be dispatched to the scene; the vessel was launched at 8:58 a.m. Following the Coast Guard search and rescue manual, the boat was to be in charge of surveying the area and \\"swiftly\\" rescuing passengers. Choi did not survive the capsizing and was later found dead. At 8:55 a.m., Sewols crew made their first distress call to the Jeju VTS and asked them to notify the Coast Guard, as the ferry was rolling and in danger. At 8:56 a.m., the Jeju VTS called the Jeju Coast Guard. Three minutes later, the Jeju Coast Guard called the Mokpo Coast Guard and discovered that a patrol boat had already been dispatched. At 9:01 a.m., a crew member on Sewol called the Incheon branch of Chonghaejin to report the situation, and Chonghaejin's head office located in Jeju then called Captain Lee at 9:03 a.m. for a report of the situation. The Incheon branch then talked with the first mate in five telephone calls over the next 35 minutes. At 9:06 a.m., the Jindo VTS were informed of the capsizing incident by the Mokpo Coast Guard. Around this time, the crew began communicating with the Jindo VTS, which was closer to their location. For the next two minutes, Jindo VTS alerted two other ships that Sewol was sinking, with one confirming that it had visual contact with the ship. At 9:07 a.m., Sewols crew confirmed that the ferry was capsizing and requested the help of the Coast Guard. At 9:14 a.m., the crew stated that the ship's angle of heel made evacuation impossible. Around this time, the captain of Patrol Vessel No. 123 was appointed the commander of the scene. Four minutes afterwards, the crew of Sewol reported to the VTS that the ferry had heeled more than 50 degrees to port. * Translation by Wall Street Journal * Translation by CNN At 9:23 a.m., the VTS ordered the crew to inform the passengers to wear life jackets. When the crew replied that the broadcasting equipment was out of order, the VTS told them to personally order the passengers to wear life jackets and more clothing. At 9:25 a.m., the VTS asked Captain Lee to decide quickly whether to evacuate the ship, stating that they did not have enough information to make the decision. When Lee inquired about the rescue, the VTS replied that patrol boats were due to arrive in ten minutes and a helicopter in one minute. Lee then replied that there were too many passengers for the helicopter. During this time, Lee told passengers to stay in their cabins. The communications officer, using the ship's intercom, repeatedly ordered passengers not to move. Around 9:30 a.m., Lee gave orders to evacuate the ship, though the order may not have been relayed to all the passengers. At 9:33 a.m., after confirming that nearby ships had volunteered to help in the rescue operations, the VTS told all ships to drop lifeboats for the passengers. At 9:38 a.m., all communications were cut off between the VTS and Sewol. About three minutes after all communications were cut, about 150 to 160 passengers and crew jumped overboard. Sewol took two and a half hours to sink. By around 11:18 a.m., the stern was submerged, with a section of the hull about high and long showing above the water. At 12:00 noon on 16 April, only of the bulbous bow was above water; at 1:03 p.m., the ship was completely submerged. =Captain and crew= During the capsizing, some members of the crew drank beer. The crew also communicated by telephone with staff from Chonghaejin at seven different times. *Translation As passengers stayed in their cabins as instructed, Captain Lee and his crew abandoned the ship. Lee, Cho, and the first and second mates were the first people to be rescued. The captain was rescued around 9:46 a.m. =Passengers= As the ship capsized, some passengers followed the announcements to stay put, even as the water came in. Most of the student passengers obeyed the announcements. Some passengers who climbed to the top of the ship or jumped into the water were rescued. Videos recording passengers during the capsizing have been recovered. Some recorded the announcements telling passengers to stay in place and put on life jackets, while some showed passengers joking around, putting on life jackets, and sending farewells. Passengers made calls, sent text messages, or sent KakaoTalk mobile messages during the capsizing. The last message was sent at 10:17 a.m. Text messages and social media posts allegedly made by survivors still trapped after the capsizing circulated in the media, but an investigation by the Cyber Terror Response Center found that none of the trapped passengers used their phones between 12:00 p.m. on 16 April and 10:00 a.m. of 17 April and that all the reported survivors' messages were fake. Rescue operations During the capsizing and the subsequent reporting, the South Korean government's announcements, as well as those from the South Korean media, were inconsistent and inaccurate. An editorial in The Huffington Post stated that the governmental reports were like a rubber band, 'increasing at one moment and decreasing at another.' *Translation by The Huffington Post here South Korea outlets such as JoongAng Ilbo, MBN, and JTBC later made corrections and apologies concerning their earlier reports. Conspiracy theories were also present in the aftermath of the sinking. =First day= At 8:58 a.m. (KST) on 16 April 2014, the Mokpo Coast Guard dispatched Patrol Vessel No. 123 in response to the first report of the incident. After receiving the news of the capsizing from the Jeollanam Provincial Government, the Republic of Korea Navy 3rd Fleet sent a (PKG) to the accident site at 9:03 a.m.; the Navy dispatched another PKG at 9:09 a.m. At 9:04 a.m., the government created the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters (Ï§ëÏïôÏû¨ÎÇúÏïàÏ†ÑÎåÄÏ±ÖÎ≥∏Î∂Ä), an organization which would directly report to the government. The Korea Coast Guard set up a rescue operations headquarters at 9:10 a.m. Patrol Vessel No. 123 arrived at the scene near 9:30 a.m. as the first ship to reach the site after the incident. During the time between the dispatch and the operations, No. 123 failed to raise Sewol, and chose to call for other ships on the radio. Consequently, crewmembers on No. 123 had not directly communicated with Sewol, and were not aware of the content of the communication between Sewol and the Jindo VTS on arrival. At the time of arrival, Sewol had listed about 50 to 60 degrees to port. Rescuers made announcements for five minutes, calling people to abandon ship and jump into the water. No. 123 began rescue operations at 9:38 a.m., with the dispatching of a rubber boat. Passengers who had reached the deck or jumped into the water were rescued, including Captain Lee, but rescuers could not get inside the ship due to the list. People trapped inside the pilothouse were rescued by breaking through the windows. At 9:35 a.m., the Korean Ministry of National Defense started operating Counter-disaster Headquarters (Ïû¨ÎÇúÎåÄÏ±ÖÎ≥∏Î∂Ä). At 9:40 a.m., the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries declared the accident to be the highest state of emergency in terms of naval accidents; consequently, the Central Accident Response Headquarters (Ï§ëÏïôÏÇ¨Í≥†ÏàòÏäµÎ≥∏Î∂Ä) was established. At the same time, the Ministry of Health and Welfare sent emergency vehicles and the first squad of the Disaster Medical Support Team (Ïû¨ÎÇúÏùòÎ£åÏßÄÏõêÌåÄ) to Jindo. At 11:28 a.m., the Korea Navy's Ship Salvage Unit (SSU) was reported to have been deployed for the operations. At 2:42 p.m., 150 special forces personnel from the ROK Army Special Warfare Command, including 40 scuba divers, were sent for the operation. At this point, 196 personnel, including 82 in the SSU and 114 in the ROK Naval Special Warfare Flotilla were involved in the operations. At 3:07, the regional government of the Gyeonggi Province was reported to have started operating the Prevention and Countermeasures Headquarters (Ïû¨ÎÇúÏïàÏ†ÑÎåÄÏ±ÖÎ≥∏Î∂Ä). After 5 p.m., units from the SSU began undersea operations. At 5:13, the Gyeonggi-do Office of Education was reported to have started operating the Ansan Danwon High School Accident Countermeasures Report Compiling Headquarters (ÏïàÏÇ∞ Îã®ÏõêÍ≥† ÏÇ¨Í≥†ÎåÄÏ±Ö Ï¢ÖÌï©ÏÉÅÌô©Î≥∏Î∂Ä). At 8:00, operations investigating the ship's hull were ceased. As of 22:03, the following units were involved in rescue operations: Naval forces include sailors from the 3rd Fleet (Ï†ú3Ìï®ÎåÄ; Á¨¨‰∏âËâ¶Èöä), a , a , and an . The ROK Air Force sent support units such as the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk, and HH-47 variant of the Boeing CH-47 Chinook. The ROK Army sent units including 150 Special Warfare Command soldiers and eleven ambulances. =Second day= MH-60S Seahawk helicopter conducted search and rescue operations at the request of the South Korean navy near where Sewol sank, on 17 April 2014. Starting on 17 April, Undine Marine Industries, a privately held company, began to lead the search for missing passengers. At 12:30 a.m., hull investigations were started by the ROK Coast Guard with the help of flares. As of 6:00 a.m., 171 ships, twenty- nine aircraft and thirty divers were involved in the rescue effort. The Korea Coast Guard had assigned twenty divers in teams of two. The ROK Navy also assigned eight divers, but the coast guard prevented them from participating and waited for divers from Undine Industries. At 7:24 a.m., civilian groups of expert divers were reported to be helping out in the rescue operations. During the morning, the number of divers involved in the operations reached 555. The Navy also established a military control tower on a Dokdo-class amphibious assault ship. Starting around 2:00 p.m., rescue operations were practically stopped due to bad weather conditions. A marine crane arrived on the scene at night. =Subsequent operations= At 10:50 a.m. on 18 April, the coast guard began pumping in air to support possible air pockets. At the same time, divers entered the capsized ship's hull but only gained access to the cargo deck. The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters. On 19 April, a Navy petty officer who was injured during rescue operations died. On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began to be used for operations. On 24 April, the CR200 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site. An Undine Marine diver died on 6 May, followed by another diver's death on 30 May. On 17 July, a firefighting helicopter returning from rescue operations crashed near an apartment complex, killing all five officers aboard and injuring a high school student. The government announced on 22 April 2015 that it had approved plans to salvage the wreckage of Sewol in hopes of finding more information about the sinking and recovering the bodies of the nine victims still missing. The plan was initially put forward by President Park Geun-hye, and was endorsed by the Minister of Public Safety and Security, Park In-yong. The operation was expected to take as long as eighteen months and to cost between US$91‚Äì137 million. =Survivors and casualties= At 11:01 a.m., Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) began reporting that all students had been rescued; this news was re-reported by other news organizations, and continued until 11:26 a.m. Around 11 a.m. (KST), officers working for the educational departments for the Gyeonggi Province sent text messages to the students' parents stating that all students had been rescued. The officers' belief was apparently confirmed by a police officer in the Danwon Police Department. Initial reports stated that rescuers retrieved 368 people from cold waters as the passengers, mostly students, had jumped overboard when the vessel started sinking; the South Korean government later corrected this statement, saying 295 passengers remained missing. Twenty-two of the twenty-nine crew survived, including fifteen responsible for the navigation. In its 17 April morning edition, Chosun Ilbo reported that 174 people had been rescued, four had died, and 284 were missing. According to CNN and its affiliate YTN, six people died. News1 Korea reported that, as of 8:00 a.m., 179 people had been rescued, six had died and 290 were missing. Three more people were found dead at 11:00 a.m. and the confirmed death toll rose to nine. At 10 p.m., Yonhap confirmed that the death toll had risen to fourteen. Over the course of the following months, the death toll rose into the hundreds. The death toll stood at 294 as of 22 July 2014, with ten missing; the date marked the recovery of the last cabin crew member. The sinking of Sewol is the deadliest ferry disaster in South Korea since 14 December 1970, when the sinking of the ferry Namyoung killed 326 out of the 338 people aboard. =Foreign response= U.S. Marines assigned to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit responding to the scene of the Sewol sinking on 16 April 2014 * The United States warship was sent to assist in the air-sea rescue operation, but did not get the approval of the ROK Navy for its helicopters to participate in the rescue. was sent to South Korea to take part in the rescue operation. * The Japan Coast Guard offered support, as well as a message of sympathy and condolences from the Japanese government. The ROK Coast Guard declined the offer, saying that, while the offer was welcome, special assistance was not needed on this occasion. Investigation =Causes= Direct causes As of 17 April 2014, the ROK Coast Guard concluded that an \\"unreasonably sudden turn\\" to starboard, made between 8:48 and 8:49 a.m. (KST), caused the cargo to shift to port, which in turn caused the ship to list and to eventually become unmanageable for the crew. The existence of the sudden turn has been confirmed by the analysis of the ship's AIS data. The ship's crew agreed that the main cause was the sudden turn. Experts such as Lee Sang-yun, a professor and head of the environment/maritime technology institute of the Pukyong National University, also agreed. Overloading and improperly secured cargo were also seen as direct causes. Sewol was carrying 3,608 tons of cargo, more than three times the limit of 987 tons. It is estimated that the actual cargo on the day of the accident weighed 2,215 tons, including 920 tons of trucks, cars and heavy equipment, 131 tons of containers and 1,164 tons of general goods. The cargo included building materials destined for naval bases on the island of Jeju. The overloading was also previously noted by an off-duty captain and the first mate. Lee Sang-yun also proposed overloading as a cause. According to the off-duty captain of Sewol, the ship owners ignored his warning that the ship should not carry so much cargo because she would not be stable. Sewol was carrying only 580 tons of ballast water, much less than the recommended 2,030 tons; this would make the vessel more prone to list and capsize. South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo argued that the discharging of ballast water was a cause of the incident. The crew had reportedly pumped out hundreds of tons of ballast water from the bottom of the ship in order to accommodate the additional cargo. The combination of the lack of ballast water and excess cargo meant that the center of gravity on the Sewol was too high for safe operation and the amount of force needed to capsize the ship was reduced to a dangerously low level. Secondary causes Secondary causes also contributed to the capsizing of the ferry by decreasing the restoring force. Renovations which added extra passenger cabins have been proposed as a main secondary cause by Kim Gill-soo (), a professor in the maritime transport technological department at the Korea Maritime University. This possible cause has also been supported by the captain, as well as Lee Sang-yun. =Obsolete theories= Explosion Gong Gil-young (), a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that the sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident. He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause. Reef collision At the beginning of the investigation, the ROK Coast Guard thought that the cause was a collision with a reef, believing this likely because the area was foggy. The captain denied this was the cause of the accident, and a reef collision has been dismissed as a cause by consensus among experts. The theory is also not currently advocated by the Coast Guard. =Captain and crew= On 19 April, Captain Lee Jun-seok, the captain of the ferry was arrested on suspicion of negligence of duty, violation of maritime law and other infringements. He had abandoned the ship with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster. Two other crew members, a helmsman and the third mate, were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter. By 26 April, twelve further arrests had been made with the whole crew responsible for navigation in detention. On 15 May, Captain Lee, First Mate Kang Won-sik (who was responsible for managing the ship's ballast), Second Mate Kim Young-ho, and Chief Engineer Park Gi-ho were indicted on charges of homicide through gross negligence (also described as murder), which carry a potential death penalty. The other eleven crew members face lesser charges of abandoning the ship and ship safety offences. Three crew members, Park Ji-young, Jeong Hyun-seon, and Kim Ki-woong, are credited by survivors with staying aboard the ferry to help passengers escape. All three went down with the sinking vessel. =Operators= On 8 May, the chief executive of Chonghaejin Marine, Kim Han- sik, was arrested and faced charges including causing death by negligence. Four other company officials were also taken into custody. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revoked Chonghaejin Marine's license to operate ferries on the Incheon-Jeju Island route in May 2014. =Owners= Yoo Byung-eun, former chairman of Chonghaejin Marine, ignored Incheon District Prosecutors' Office summons, and went into hiding. On 22 May, the Incheon District Court issued an arrest warrant and Korean authorities offered a million () reward for information leading to the arrest of Yoo. On 25 May, the reward was raised tenfold to million (). On 21 July 2014, it was reported that a body found in a field in June was believed to be Yoo's. =Regulation= The disaster raised questions regarding governmental regulation of shipping in South Korea. Shipping is regulated by the Korean Shipping Association, which is also an industry trade group, which experts consider a likely conflict of interest. In addition, government regulators outside the Association frequently move to jobs as part of the association after their government service. Yun Jong-hwui, a professor at Korea Maritime and Ocean University, notes that while South Korean regulations are strong, they are often poorly enforced. Litigation On 3 June, the Gwangju District Court issued arrest warrants for a senior vessel safety operator of the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon unit and a vessel inspector of the Korean Register of Shipping's Mokpo unit. Amongst 15 crew accused of the sinking, prosecutors sought the death penalty for Captain Lee under the charge of homicide and the prosecution told the court that he failed to carry out his duty. Lead prosecutor Park Jae-eok said: \\"Lee supplied the cause of the sinking of the Sewol...he has the heaviest responsibility for the accident. We ask that the court sentence him to death.\\" While no formal pleas were made, Lee denied intent to kill. The others had lesser charges, including negligence. A three-judge panel would announce its verdicts in November. The Incheon District Court, on Wednesday, 5 November, sentenced the late ferry owner Yoo Byung-eun's eldest son Yoo Dae-kyoon to three years in prison for embezzlement and breach of trust. On 11 November 2014, the Gwangju District Court found Captain Lee Jun-seok guilty of negligence and sentenced him to 36 years' imprisonment. The judges said that he was clearly not the only person responsible for the tragedy and they accepted that his negligence did not amount to an intent to kill. The chief engineer of the ferry, Park Gi- ho, was found guilty of murder and jailed for 30 years. Thirteen other crew members were given jail sentences of up to 20 years on charges including abandonment and violating maritime law. Relatives of victims were distraught at the verdict, with some weeping. The AFP news agency reported that one woman screamed in the courtroom: \\"It's not fair. What about the lives of our children? They (the defendants) deserve worse than death.\\" In the cases against officials over the overloading of cargo, Kim Han-sik, Chonghaejin Marine's chief executive, was found guilty of negligence and received a ten- year prison term. Six other company employees and a Korean Shipping Association official also received prison sentences. Following appeals by prosecutors and the accused, on 28 April 2015 Captain Lee was found guilty of murder and his sentence increased to life imprisonment, while those for 14 other crew members were reduced to a maximum of 12 years, including 10 years for chief engineer Park Gi-ho, whose murder conviction was overturned. Judge Jeon Il-ho explained: \\"We drew a distinction between the Captain Lee Joon-seok who has a grave responsibility and crew members who took orders from the captain.\\" Kim Han-sik's sentence was also reduced to seven years on appeal.  Aftermath  =Government's report and concerns about public opinion= On 16 November 2016, a report about the Sewol disaster, compiled by the National Intelligence Service and intended for President Park, was publicized. The report referred to the sinking as \\"just a ferry accident ()\\" and said \\"we must control the protest in the name of ferry accident ()\\". The report makes no mention of investigating the sinking, salvaging the hull, or supporting the victims' families, instead devoted to determining ways to \\"control the protesting attempt by the opposition forces in the name of the ferry accident and suggest a method about public opinion manipulation using the government- organized demonstrations.\\" The sinking contributed to the political downfall of Park. As criticism of her handling of the disaster grew stronger, the Park administration established a commission to monitor and prosecute her critics. Tatsuya Kato, a Japanese journalist, was indicted on charges of defamation for reporting that Park had responded to the disaster by meeting with fringe religious leader Choi Soon-sil. In 2016, the full extent of Choi's ties to Park emerged in South Korean media, which caused a corruption scandal that ultimately resulted in Park's impeachment by the National Assembly on 9 December 2016. A unanimous Constitutional Court ruling on 10 March 2017 upheld the impeachment vote, ending her presidency. After Moon Jae-in removed Park from office, documents revealed that she had made a secret blacklist of artists to be barred from receiving any sort of government acknowledgement or sponsorship. It was further discovered that the initial purpose of this blacklist was to censor those who commemorated the Sewol victims in their artwork. In July 2017, members of the Park administration were imprisoned for up to three years for their role in creating the illegal blacklist.6 Ex- Officials in South Korea Are Sentenced for Blacklisting Artists NYT = Media representation = The aftermath of the sinking is documented in a film, created by two British filmmakers that were living in South Korea during the tragedy. The film uses interviews with survivors, emergency response workers, and family members of the victims along with news reports to create a study about the conflicting reports about disaster. A separate short documentary In the Absence was created to showcase the disaster in real time, with audio, visual and multi-media messages and video from the victims. The documentary was nominated for Best Documentary Short in the 2020 Oscars. The disaster is the subject of the 2014 documentary film Daibingbel: The Truth Shall Not Sink with Sewol. The director's cut of the film was made available for public viewing on YouTube on 31 August 2015. The disaster is also subject of another documentary in 2016, After the Sewol.Film points finger at South Korean government for Sewol disaster, BBC News, 23 April 2017. Reactions A memorial wall near the Danwon High School, where most of the victims were from A memorial ceremony in Hwarang Public Garden, a park near the Danwon High School Pope Francis wearing a yellow ribbon on his 2014 state visit to South Korea. Before his visit, he said that he \\"hoped the South Korean people take the Sewol tragedy as an occasion for moral and spiritual rebirth.\\" =Political= In addition to reaction against the actions of the captain and much of the crew of Sewol, there has been a much wider political reaction to the disaster. Criticism has ranged from anger at the lax regulatory environment which may have contributed to the safety violations that could have sunk Sewol, to anger about the rescue operations, to anger at Park Geun- hye, then President of South Korea, whose approval ratings fell from a high of 71 percent before the disaster to \\"the 40 percent range\\" weeks afterwards. Political reaction to the Sewol sinking has been intensified by a series of events. A prominent South Korean politician from the ruling Saenuri Party, Chung Mong-joon, was forced to apologize when his son wrote a controversial Facebook post criticizing the public for criticizing the government over the disaster. Many parents of the victims of the tragedy have been expressing deep anger at the government, ranging from reportedly berating Prime Minister Jung Hong-won to shouting at President Park Geun-hye, to parents staging protests at the presidential palace itself, partly inflamed by a reported remark by a senior news editor at the government-influenced Korean Broadcasting System that the number of dead in the ferry tragedy was \\"not many, compared with the number of people killed in traffic accidents each year\\". Barack Obama, then President of the United States, sent his condolences, stated that the United States would help in the search for survivors, and during a state visit to South Korea presented a magnolia tree from the White House to the high school. Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe offered sympathy to the victims. Truong Tan Sang, the President of Vietnam, as well as the deputy prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs, sent their condolences to Yun Byung-se, South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sent their condolences to the president of South Korea. Xi Jinping, the President of China, sent messages on condolences to Park. On 23 April, North Korea sent its condolences. On 27 April, Jung Hong-won, the prime minister of South Korea, accepted responsibility and announced his resignation. On 29 April, South Korean president Park Geun-hye indirectly apologized for the government's response to the ferry sinking. On 18 May 2014, the BBC reported that President Park Geun-hye announced South Korea \\"plans to break up its coastguard\\" after it had failed to respond well during the MV Sewol ferry disaster. According to Park, \\"investigation and information roles will be transferred to the Korean police while the rescue and salvage operation and ocean security roles will be transferred to the Department for National SafetyNot to be confused with the Korean Ministry of Security and Public Administration which will be newly established\\". =Civilian= Memorial place on Gwanghwamun Plaza Memorial booth on Gwanghwamun Plaza On 17 April, a representative of the Cheonghaejin Marine Company apologized for the incident. The chairman and CEO of Korean Register of Shipping, Chon Young-Kee, resigned on 28 April, following raids on KR offices by South Korean prosecutors. On 18 April 2014, the rescued vice principal of Danwon High School, Kang Min-kyu, 52, committed suicide by hanging himself. Kang had organized the field trip that had brought the high school party aboard the ship, and had written in his two-page suicide note, found in his wallet by police, that \\"Surviving alone is too painful when 200 lives are unaccounted for ... I take full responsibility.\\" The note ended with a request that his body be cremated and the ashes scattered over the site of the accident, \\"that I might be a teacher in heaven to those kids whose bodies have not been found.\\" On 22 April, a netizen made a post encouraging others to take part in a yellow ribbon campaign on KakaoTalk. The image accompanying the post had a caption stating, 'One small movement, big miracles'. Since then, the yellow ribbon has been used to symbolize mourning for the sinking victims. The ribbons are prominent in social media, sometimes as profile photos, and were used by celebrities such as Jo Kwon and Hye-rim Park. In 2017, the yellow ribbon campaign received renewed media coverage as various musicians wrote songs with references to the symbol or were seen wearing the ribbon during performances and celebrities posted images of the ribbon on their social media sites to commemorate the third year after the disaster. On 17 April 2015, a day after the first anniversary of the sinking, 4,475 participants holding electronic candles formed the shape of the Sewol ferry at the commemoration event titled 'The Saddest Challenge in the World' in Seoul Plaza in front of City Hall. The event continues to be memorialized by Korean students in school ceremonies. Salvage  On 22 March 2017, the salvage operation began to raise the wreck of sunken Sewol. A Chinese consortium, Shanghai Salvage Company, was contracted by the South Korean government to carry out the salvage operation. The ship was lying on its port side, nearly 40 metres below the surface. Diesel and oil were drained from the ship. All the cabins were sealed and a huge fence was erected on the seabed to prevent any wreckage from drifting away. A crane lifted the bow of the ship five degrees so that 33 lifting beams could be placed underneath. The salvage crew pumped water out of the ship's ballast tanks and attached air bags to increase the ship's buoyancy. Cables were attached to the lifting beams and strand jacks gradually lifted the ship to 13 metres above the surface, where it was then attached to a barge. The ship was then towed and loaded onto a semi-submersible vessel, Dockwise White Marlin. The ship was loaded onto self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) while on the vessel, which then transported it to shore. The vessel docked at Mokpo, where ALE were contracted to unload the ship using the SPMTs. Bones reportedly found within the ferry were analyzed and affirmed to be of animal origin. As of 5 June 2017, the remains of Danwon High School student Cho Eun- hwa and passenger Lee Young-sook have been discovered and positively identified. The remains of a third victim have been discovered relatively intact, although DNA testing is still ongoing to determine the identity of those remains.

The party was several blocks away from the University of Calgary campus, and held to mark the end of its school year. It was Calgary's deadliest massacre. Stabbing The attack occurred at 1:20 a.m. at a house at 11 Butler Crescent, where about thirty people were present at a party. The assailant, an invited guest, committed the attacks shortly after arriving at the party. He obtained a large knife at the house and stabbed the victims methodically. Each victim was stabbed multiple times. The suspected attacker fled on foot but was arrested by police 40 minutes later with the aid of the K-9 unit. Victims The victims were Joshua Hunter, Kaitlin Perras, Jordan Segura, Lawrence Hong and Zackariah Rathwell, who ranged from 21 to 27 years of age. Hunter lived in Priddis, Alberta, and the other four lived in Calgary. Hong, Segura and Rathwell were pronounced dead at the scene, and Perras and Hunter died in hospital. Perpetrator Matthew de Grood, aged 22, was identified as the suspect. He attended the University of Calgary and was planning on attending law school. Prior to the stabbings, he was an employee of Safeway. He is the son of a city police officer with the rank of Inspector. He was held at a secure psychiatric facility adjacent to the Calgary Remand Centre. According to authorities, de Grood personally knew at least one person that was present during the party. According to his parents and classmates, his behaviour had started to change in the weeks before the stabbings; he began posting more frequently on Facebook, submitting \\"bizarre\\" status updates. Hours before the killings, he posted the title of the Megadeth song \\"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\\" to his Facebook page. Prior to the stabbing, he sent text messages to his parents, claiming he was going to harm himself. De Grood was charged with five counts of first-degree murder and was ordered to stand trial on May 29, 2015. He had no previous run-ins with the police. On May 22, he was found mentally fit to stand trial after undergoing a psychiatric assessment. On May 29, 2015, his trial was set to begin on May 16, 2016, with jury selection set to begin four days earlier. On May 25, 2016, de Grood was found not criminally responsible for the homicides on the basis of a mental disorder (schizophrenia, per two of three expert witnesses) that caused a psychotic episode during the killings. According to his lawyer, Allan Fay, he intentionally killed the five victims, but believed they were werewolves and vampires who threatened his life. The NCR order means de Grood will be locked down in a psychiatric facility, and receive periodic reviews that could lead to his release under certain conditions. Matthew de Grood told the Alberta Review Board he wishes the ‚Äúterrible tragedy‚Äù had never happened. https://globalnews.ca/news/4433256/matthew-de-grood-stabbing-deaths-calgary/ In September 2019, Matthew de Grood was granted unsupervised outings by the Alberta Review Board, although they say that he \\"remains a significant risk to the safety of the public.\\" https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/killer- matthew-de-grood-granted-unsupervised-outings/ University response Although the stabbings occurred off-campus, the close relationship between the parties involved and the University of Calgary elicited a direct response from the school's community. University president M. Elizabeth Cannon described the event as a \\"senseless tragedy\\" in which the community \\"lost a part of its family.\\" On April 15, 2015, the university held the UCalgaryStrong Festival, meant both to celebrate the end of the school year and to commemorate the one- year anniversary of the stabbing. The festival was part of the broader UCalgaryStrong initiative, which aims to \\"reduce loneliness and isolation, and foster resiliency in the face of the stressors that are part of the post- secondary experience.\\" Victim Lawrence Hong was also granted a posthumous degree in 2015, and memorial scholarships have been established for him and two other victims, Joshua Hunter, and Jordan Segura, in their respective disciplines. Zackariah Rathwell was granted a posthumous degree in 2015 from the Alberta College of Art and Design.

The term was coined in the 1980s. For decades, industrially produced air pollutants (chiefly sulfur dioxide), water pollution, acid rain and other effects took an enormous toll on the health of local residents and the surrounding environment. After the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe, the three nations acted to cut emissions. This has resulted in significant environmental improvement.  Geography  In shape the \\"triangle\\" is more similar to a crescent, an industrial corridor roughly 60 kilometers wide, lying on either side of the northern Czech border extending from the German town of Bad Brambach on the west to the Polish town of Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka at the eastern end.based on the placement of Joint Air Monitoring Stations; page 11 The approximate center is the national tripoint at Zittau. Politically the \\"triangle\\" consists of:page 9 * Germany's two local administrative regions surrounding Dresden and Chemnitz, amounting to about 14,000 square kilometers, with a population of 3.36 million people (as of 2002) * the southwest portion of Poland's Lower Silesian Voivodeship, amounting to 8,500 square kilometers, with a population of 1.3 million * four regions of the Czech Republic (Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Karlovy Vary, Liberec and √öst√≠ nad Labem), amounting to 12,000 square kilometers and a population of 1.59 million The Polish portion includes the southernmost \\"panhandle\\" of the Gmina Bogatynia, where the vast Tur√≥w strip mine has extracted lignite resources since 1904. The entire area is framed by mountain ranges which form a local climate, trapping air and intensifying the effects of the air pollution.  Exploitation  The general area is historically known for its natural resources and mineral deposits, and had traditional glass, ceramics, and textiles industries. The Ore Mountains between Saxony and Bohemia have been the scene of multiple Berggeschrei (\\"silver rushes\\") over centuries, the first in 1168. From that discovery at Christiansdorf (part of the Freiberg Mining Field), mining was carried out uninterruptedly in the Ore Mountains until 1990. Amongst the raw materials mined over the course of centuries were ores of the metals silver, tin, zinc, cobalt, nickel, copper and lead; anthracite and uranium were also extracted into the 20th century and were engines for the economic development of Saxony. The pace of mineral exploitation rose dramatically in the 20th century. In late 1942, under wartime German control, the Czech town of Most began output of Ersatz fuel synthesized from brown coal at the \\"Sudetenl√§ndische Treibstoffwerke AG (STW) Maltheuren plant\\", operating with forced labor. The town was repeatedly bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. After the war, with Soviet domination of the area, Moscow ordered the industrial development of the North Bohemian Basin on a grand scale. The installation of chemical plants, steel factories and refineries required vast amounts of energy; the energy came from burning dirty and inexpensive lignite (brown coal) from local strip mines. As one example of the impact, in 1964 the Most Coal Company (Mosteck√° uheln√°/ MUS) began the demolition of the entire medieval Old Town of Most to make room for the expanding lignite mines. The inhabitants were given two options: move into the new housing projects, or leave town. SDAG Wismut uranium mining operations in Saxony and Thuringia Similar developments took place throughout the Black Triangle. Much of the energy produced was exported to western Europe in exchange for hard currency. The Czech town of J√°chymov was the site of an \\"infamous\\" uranium mine, while the largest concentration of uranium mines in all of Europe stood nearby in East Germany. They were operated as a military secret and \\"in the prevailing spirit of Soviet gigantism\\" by SDAG Wismut to feed the Soviet atomic bomb project. The net result of industrial activity in the Triangle were huge quantities of particulate emissions, heavy metals, sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides which largely destroyed adjacent forests of the Jizera Mountains with acid rain, and measurable impact on health and life expectancy.  Recovery  After the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe, in June 1991 the three nations signed a joint declaration of cooperation to address the Black Triangle's environmental issues. They later coordinated with the European Commission, which has funded small projects and measurement initiative through its Phare program. This has resulted in significant improvement in human health, the health of forests, and levels of pollutants. In 1991 after German reunification SDAG Wismut was transformed into the Wismut GmbH company, owned by the Federal Republic of Germany, which is now responsible for the restoration and environmental cleanup of the former mining and milling areas. the Tur√≥w Coal Mine, southern Poland The region remains an important industrial center with serious environmental challenges. The Tur√≥w Coal Mine, still operated by the Polska Grupa Energetyczna, produces about 30 million tons of lignite annually. The bowl-shaped open-pit mine is several kilometers in diameter, about 200 meters deep, and has completely transformed the original geographic character of the Turoszowska Basin. The mine and its extensive dumping grounds now cover more than half the basin. A documentary film about the Black Triangle won a Golden Gate Award at the 1991 San Francisco International Film Festival. Czech photographer Josef Koudelka also produced a book about the region, ƒåern√Ω Trojuheln√≠k - Podkru≈°nohor√≠ (The Black Triangle: The Foothills of the Ore Mountain) in 1994.

Between 1917 and 1920, the ALA raised $5 million from public donations, erected 36 camp libraries, distributed 7 to 10 million books and magazines, and provided library collections to more than 500 locations, including military hospitals. The Library War Service also provided books in Braille to soldiers that were blinded in battle. Library War Service librarians wore uniforms, similar to those worn by other volunteer groups like the American Red Cross, and the Library War Service provides some of the earliest examples of women participating in uniformed war service overseas. Millions of public libraries in the United States also participated in Library War Service activities, serving as collection points for books as well as places to organize and promote the War Service campaign. The efforts of the Library War Service eventually led to the creation of many modern library services, including the creation of library departments in the Army, Navy, Veterans' Association and Merchant Marine, as well as the establishment of the American Library in Paris, which remains the largest English-language lending library on the European continent today. Establishment In 1917, as America entered World War I, the American Library Association (ALA) established the Committee on Mobilization and War Service Plans. Shortly after its formation, the ALA's committee was invited by the Department of War's Commission on Training Camp Activities to provide library services to soldiers. Joining the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the Salvation Army, the Jewish Welfare Board, the Knights of Columbus and the War Camp Community Service, the American Library Association became one of the \\"Seven Sisters\\" providing social, health and welfare services to soldiers in camps under the auspices of the Commission on Training Camp Activities. Though the ALA had only 3,300 members and an annual budget of $25,000, the Library War Service eventually raised over five million dollars and collected over ten million books for distribution. At the height of the Library War Service, even this large collection was unable to meet all of the military's needs. Camp libraries Camp Sheridan. World War I camp libraries all had a similar design, varying only in length. Most libraries were equipped with a motor vehicle (pictured) to transport books. With the help of a $320,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation, the Library War Service established 36 \\"camp libraries\\" at military bases and training camps. The Carnegie Corporation and the Library War Service also funded 1,100 library workers to staff camp libraries and military hospitals. The 36 camp libraries were simple wooden buildings, similar to World War I canteens. The libraries were designed by architect Edward L. Tilton, and provided space for 10,000 volumes and around 200 readers, in buildings that were only between 90 and 120 feet long. Most camp libraries were also provisioned with a small car for the transportation of books. National campaigns provided books to the training camps, hospitals, Red Cross Houses, and small military encampments at home and abroad. The libraries were a place for soldiers to gather, relax and enjoy a touch of home and civilization. Libraries at Camp Upton and Camp Sherman received special permission to install fireplaces to encourage this environment. However, Library War Service books were not just used for entertainment and diversion. They also contained information required for effective military operations and they helped prepare soldiers socially and intellectually for life after the war. In 1918, a librarian at Camp Meade wrote the following to a reporter about his troops' need for books: > We are having repeated calls for technical handbooks and textbooks. We want > all kinds of engineering handbooks, mechanics handbooks, books on > engineering and books on all branches of the service. They cannot be too > technical for the men. You will be interested to know how quickly the newly > purchased books are snapped up. Of the six copies of Thompson's Electricity, > four are out now and were out within a week of when they were ready. At the height of the war, nearly every YMCA, Knights of Columbus, Young Men's Hebrew Association and base hospital at a barracks was used as distribution point for War Service books, and nearly every book was in constant use. Books and periodicals were minimally cataloged and camp librarians were either volunteers, or were paid a small annual salary of around $1,200. Uniforms Like other volunteers during the war, especially the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, Library War Service librarians wore uniforms while performing their duties. There were separate uniforms for camp librarians and hospital librarians, as well as separate uniforms for men and women. Camp librarians wore a forest green uniform, similar to a military uniform, with ALA pins and patches that marked the wearer as a War Service librarian. Female librarians working in hospital libraries had a unique uniform of naturally colored pongee. Most women who wore uniforms during World War I were members of civilian relief services like the Library War Service. While men could have their uniforms locally tailored, women librarians' uniforms were custom-made by Best & Company of New York City, reflecting the challenges of providing military uniforms for women in the early 20th century. Legacy The work of the Library War Service continued after the end of the war, hitting its peak in April 1919.Bertram, Cara. (November 14, 2013). \\"After the Eleventh Hour.\\" American Library Association Archives. After the war, the U.S. military assimilated most wartime library services, and ALA-managed libraries were transformed into military-managed libraries. Following the example set by the Library War Service, formal, professional library departments were created in the U.S. Army and Navy. Library service in military hospitals also continued, first under U.S. Public Health Service, then under the sponsorship of the Veteran's Bureau, and today under the Veterans' Administration (VA). In 1921, the Library War Service helped found the American Merchant Marine Library Association to benefit the Merchant Marine and the U.S. Coast Guard. The War Service also has a lasting civilian legacy. The American Library Association established the American Library in Paris to provide English books to American soldiers serving in France. The library continues to operate today as the largest English-language lending library in continental Europe. Many library services, such as the distribution of Braille books through the mail, were first implemented by the Library War Service during World War I.

He was so advanced academically that according to his son, Vincent James, he substitute-taught his high school physics class when the teacher was absent. While in high school he met his future wife, Ileana. Lamberti won a scholarship to Yale University, where he was thought of as such a \\"geek\\" that his dorm mates were known to lock him out of his room, forcing him to climb up a drain pipe to get back into his dormitory. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Sigma Xi society. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1947 and earned a doctorate in organic chemistry in 1951. Career Lamberti joined Lever Brothers in 1949 after interviewing with major drug and chemical companies. Lamberti spent 40 years with the company, mostly at its Edgewater, New Jersey research center, where as patent coordinator and manager of organic chemistry, he led a team to create new and improved products. In the 1950s, Lamberti developed an easier and relatively inexpensive process to manufacture a synthetic compound to replace the fatty acids in bar soap, which was considered a breakthrough in the development of synthetic bar soap. This led to the Dove beauty bar, which Lever Brothers marketed as being less irritating to the skin than traditional soaps. Other brands Lamberti helped develop or improve include Wisk and Aim toothpaste. Lamberti was an opponent of animal testing, and did not participate in that practice. Lamberti accumulated a total of 118 granted patents, in the U.S. and other countries, all of which were property of Lever Brothers. According to Stephen Madison, senior principal scientist with Unilever, of which Lever Brothers was part (and whom Lamberti hired), no one else at Unilever held as many patents. He also wrote over 2,000 patents for other inventors all over the world. Personal life Lamberti lived in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.

Curt Kosswig is known as the Father of Turkish Zoology. Early life Curt Kosswig was born in Berlin and graduated from Berlin's Sch√∂neberg Hohenzollern School (Hohenzollernschule),Curt Kosswig Biography at ege.edu.tr, written in honor of Kosswig's 100th birthday in 2003 (Turkish). graduating in 1922. Afterwards, he attended the University of Berlin studying Natural Sciences, Zoology, and Genetics, where he completed his PhD in 1927. In 1930, he married his wife Leonore (1904‚Äì1973) who was also a biologist. They would become acclaimed as a husband and wife research team in Turkey. They had two sons, the older of whom is named Kurt Kosswig (Kurt with a 'K' rather than his father's 'C') who became a chemist. Academic career Curt Kosswig was a lifetime academic and scholar, widely published and well-respected within a wide range of fields but primarily zoology. Among his important scientific publications were advances in the understanding of sex-determination systems, carcinogenesis, constructive and regressive evolution, genetics of house pets, zoological geography, and species classification. His research interests and fields of study widened considerably once he arrived in Turkey and was able to found an entire department from the ground up. =Early rise in academia: pre-1927= Completing his bachelor's degree at the University of Berlin, in the mid-1920s began to study for a PhD in genetics under Professor Erwin Bauer.Curt Kosswig Biography at ege.edu.tr, written in honor of Kosswig's 100th birthday in 2003 (Turkish).

He was only 21 years old upon publication of his first paper. Another of his papers was accepted for publication in 1926. Curt Kosswig was awarded a doctorate (PhD) in genetics on April 1, 1927, at age 23. In this year, he published his doctoral research work as The Gene in Foreign Genotypes (German: Das Gen in fremder Erbmasse). He had conducted experiments with cyprinodonts, which were groundbreaking in the field of genetics, which \\"anticipated the concept we now know as gene transfer in carcinogenesis.\\"Biologists Under Hitler by Ute Deichmann [1999] page 25 Additionally, Kosswig published eleven more academic papers as a young PhD, from 1927 to 1929, four a total fourteen published papers by his 26th birthday.List of Curt Kosswig Publications (German) =Early career in Germany, 1927‚Äì33= As Germany's situation deteriorated and the Depression deepened, Kosswig's academic career soared, with seventeen more papers published between 1930 and 1933 for a prolific total of 31 papers published before his 30th birthday in late 1933. (In total, he authored or coauthored 152 papers that were published in journals between 1925 and 1948 alone, with many more later.) In 1927, he got a job as an assistant professor at M√ºnster University in M√ºnster, Germany. Kosswig worker there for six years, starting the very semester that a Leopold von Ubisch (1886‚Äì1965) took over the Zoology Department. Kosswig would remain loyal to von Ubisch in the 1930s when Ubisch came under political persecution. On April 1, 1933, he left Munster to be installed as a professor at Braunschweig University of Technology. He retained this position until fall 1937, when he abruptly left for Turkey. The story of his emigration to Turkey belongs more in the realm of politics. =Involvement in politics and Rassenkunde, 1933‚Äì36= Curt Kosswig was not a member of any political party before 1933.Biologists Under Hitler By Ute Deichmann [1999], page 73 In November 1933, Kosswig joined the SS, an elite branch of the NSDAP (Nazi Party). His relations with the Nazi Party were never warm, though, as demonstrated by the events of 1935 in M√ºnster. He supported the principles of academic freedom and supported all academic non-conformists who came under political persecution by the state.Biologists Under Hitler by Ute Deichmann [1999] page 25 While at Braunschweig from 1933 onward, Kosswig came under the purview of the newly created Race and Settlement Office (RuSHA) under Walther Darre. Kosswig was asked to serve as an educator for this organization. Part of his duties included lecturing NSDAP party members and groups of interested citizens about genetics and racial anthropology (called Rassenkunde).... \\"Er [Kosswig] war nicht nur f√ºr die Lehrerausbildung zust√§ndig, sondern sollte Rassenkunde und Gesellschaftsbiologie auch f√ºr andere Studierende sowie f√ºr Parteimitglieder und die interessierte Bev√∂lkerung lehren\\" Dr. Kosswig preferred the academic world to the political, and had never registered with any political party in his 20s.Biologists Under Hitler By Ute Deichmann [1999], page 73 In November 1933, Kosswig joined the SSFrom chapter \\"Herausforderung\\" The Past, as Viewed by a Physicist: Hans Kopfermann, 1895‚Äì1963 (A study of science) by Klaus Schl√ºpmann (German: Vergangenheit im Blickfeld eines Physikers: Hans Kopfermann 1895‚Äì1963 (Eine Wissenschaftsstudie) (German); Note: In this book, the author speculates that Curt Kosswig, among many other academics of the time, joined the SS solely to \\"stabilize\\", or advance, his career. Ute Deichmann (Biologists Under Hitler) claims that Kosswig \\"was at first quite willing to work with the NDAP\\". (see note for possible reasons), an elite branch of the NSDAP (Nazi Party). His relations with the Nazi Party were never warm, though, as demonstrated by the events of 1935 in M√ºnster. =The Munster Zoology Department chairmanship crisis, 1934‚Äì36= From 1933, the new German government instituted a policy of encouraging Jewish professors to leave German universities, especially those seen to be in positions of political importance. The head of the Munster Zoology Department, Professor von Ubisch, was half-Jewish and seen as politically unreliable. After a long controversy, Ubisch was finally dismissed from his post as head of the Zoology Department at Munster University in 1935, after which he emigrated to Norway. Kosswig, who had worked with Ubisch for six years at Munster, maintained his support for Ubisch. Following the dismissal of his former superior, Dr. Kosswig was asked to take up the chair. He declined.Biologists Under Hitler By Ute Deichmann [1999], page 73 As the authorities looked for possible candidates to replace Ubisch, the entire local academic community became involved, some supporting Ubisch and some opposing him. Ubisch's two assistants were fired. Kosswig (then an assistant professor at Braunschweig University) secured jobs for both of the dismissed assistants. This, on top of refusing to take the seat itself in protest, lost him favor in the eyes of the party. These are factors which may have contributed to his own decision to leave Germany in 1937. =Emigration to Turkey, 1937= Following the \\"Ubisch succession crisis\\" in Munster, Curt Kosswig left the SS (in 1936).From chapter \\"Herausforderung\\" The Past, as Viewed by a Physicist: Hans Kopfermann, 1895‚Äì1963 (A study of science) by Klaus Schl√ºpmann (German: Vergangenheit im Blickfeld eines Physikers: Hans Kopfermann 1895‚Äì1963 (Eine Wissenschaftsstudie) (German); He also started thinking about leaving Germany itself, which he did in autumn 1937 at the invitation of the University of Istanbul and some German professors who were already there. In doing so, he became one of the 190 total German academics who emigrated to Turkey during the 1930s in Germany.Turkey‚Äôs Invitations to Nazi-Persecuted Intellectuals Circa 1933 Kosswig remained outside Germany during World War II (1939‚Äì1945) and the occupation and reconstruction (Wiederaufbau) periods, but retained active contact with his European colleagues, exchanging materials, information, and research. =Career in Turkey, 1937‚Äì55= His output was prolific in his Turkish years, with hundreds of articles published, and en entire major university department being built around him at Istanbul. The Zoology Department at the University of Istanbul, which still exists today, is considered to have been entirely founded by Curt Kosswig. Already in 1937, Kosswig was given directorship of the Istanbul Zoology Museum. He oversaw its expansion and \\"collected examples of mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, fish and various invertebrates, which he brought in the museum contributing to its enrichment.\\" In these years, Dr. Kosswig expanded his field of study to include mammals, comparative genetics, gender inheritance, tumor genetics, gene manifestation, Anatolian fauna, and even continental drift theory. He worked with and encouraged his doctoral students to study, among other things, hereditary tumors in animals, fish polygenic sex determination, freshwater and marine fish in Anatolia, animal species systematics, giant chromosome structure, fish intersexuality, DDT effects, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in bacteriaCurt Kosswig Biography at ege.edu.tr written in honor of Kosswig's 100th birthday (Turkish). Kosswig discovered, identified, and named many new species in this time, including the rare Saz Baligi and Aphanius splendens. In 1942, a colleague named a new genus of pupfishes as Kosswigichthys in his honor, which was renamed by Kosswig and that colleague (Dr. Soezer) in 1945 as Anatolichthys in honor of their place of origin in Anatolia. This genus is now called Aphanius. Dr. Kosswig continued publishing and research, and even took up the role of \\"adventurer\\" in search of new and lost species. In this context, in 1950 he became one of the first Europeans allowed by Turkey to cross the Euphrates into southeastern Turkey, on a voyage he organized and led \\"in pursuit of two ancient species‚Äîa saltwater fish in the hills above Lake Van and the fabled bald ibis of Birecik\\".Article: Beyond the Euphrates: The Photography of Cafer Turkmen published in Cornucopia Magazine, Volume 30. \\"The expeditions undertaken by Curt Kosswig and photographed by Cafer T√ºrkmen provide the first views of Turkey's eastern frontierland, which, for security reasons, had been hidden from outside view from 1914 until 1950. The moment that the curtain was lifted, this remote, dramatic country with a profoundly ancient culture immediately began to lure travellers, historians and scientists such as Kosswig, who undertook two small but ground-breaking expeditions, in 1952 and 1954. / An exile from pre-war Nazi Germany, Kosswig had become a doyen of the newly created department of zoology at Istanbul University, where he nurtured ambitions to create a Turkish natural history museum. / It was for this project that he recruited Cafer T√ºrkmen, a talented young photographer and pupil of the fledgling academic study of photography as art. Although Kosswig never realised his museum plan, by taking T√ºrkmen on his expeditions, he gave the young photographer the opportunity of compiling a unique body of work on Turkey's rich animal life. / Born in Berlin in 1903, Kosswig had left Germany in 1937 after a spate of Nazi-prompted sackings: his area of research, genetics, made his position particularly sensitive. With his wife, Leonore, a trained botanist, he made his home in Istanbul, becoming part of the substantial intellectual diaspora that did so much to drag Turkish academic life into the modern age in the early decades of the Republic. / Today the Kosswigs are best remembered in Turkey for founding the nature reserve at Manyas, near Bandƒ±rma on the Sea of Marmara. They set up the reserve soon after they arrived in the country, having observed its extraordinary and fragile habitat, which feeds and shelters migrating and nesting birds.\\" Kosswig is also remembered as the founder of the bird sanctuary at Lake Manyas (now called Lake Ku≈ü) in Turkey, which still exists todayCurt Kosswig Biography at ege.edu.tr written in honor of Kosswig's 100th birthday (Turkish). =Back in Germany, 1955‚Äì69= Curt Kosswig returned to Germany in 1955 at the invitation of the University of Hamburg. He worked there for fourteen years until being bestowed the title of Professor Emeritus in 1969. He served as the director of the Zoological Institute and the Zoological Museum at Hamburg University.

Meanwhile, ACP Dilip Sangodkar (Sharad Kelkar) from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the police force is after drug kingpin Mantoo (Uday Tikekar), who is supported by brothers Kevin Ferriera (Nishikant Kamat) and Luke Ferriera (Teddy Maurya), who not only deal drugs but also control a mass racket in organ harvesting with a professional assassin Attila (Kazu Patrick Tang) who cleans up after their mess. One night, Anna and her accomplice, who is also her boyfriend, steal drugs from Mantoo's henchman Bigshow. Anna hides the drugs in a camera which she pawns to Kabir. The consignment loss enrages Mantoo, and he insults Kevin by slapping at his bald head and gives Kevin three days to recover the stolen drugs, threatening that if he failed to do so, he would take the money back by selling all four of the brothers' kidneys. Luke and Attila reach Anna's place, where Luke tortures Anna for the camera. However, much to their surprise, Naomi becomes an eye witness to the brutal torments. Unwittingly, Anna reveals them the location of the drug, as a response to which Bigshow enters Kabir's house along with Viju, demanding the camera. Kabir is obliged to hand the camera to Luke when he tells him that both Naomi and Anna are his captives. Kabir gets a call from Kevin to make a delivery to Mantoo, and promises that in return, he will set Anna and Naomi free. Kabir goes to deliver the drugs to Mantoo, where he finds that police officers have already raided Mantoo's haven. Mantoo flees and Kabir chases him, but he is arrested by police. They are shocked to find Anna's naked body with all her organs harvested in Kabir's car. Kevin, infuriated by the insult he faced from Mantoo, decides to murder Mantoo and become the new drug lord, which he does with no hesitation. During interrogation, Kabir escapes from the police station. The officers are bewildered by his combat skills and find out he was a former decorated RAW Agent and Special Forces soldier who retired after his pregnant wife Rukshida (Shruti Haasan) was murdered. Kabir fights with Attila at a nightclub and is shot, but breaks into a medicine shop and performs an impromptu surgery. He then continues on his journey, and finds and frees several child slaves in a drug manufacturing plant, and in the process, kills Luke. He tracks down Kevin, who says he has had Naomi killed. He shows a container that has what he says are her eyes. Kabir kills all the gang members, including Attila and Kevin. As Kabir prepares to commit suicide out of utter grief, Naomi emerges. It is revealed she had been saved by Attila before her eye surgery; he took pity on her because she had been kind to him. The eyes in the container belonged to the gangsters' surgeon, who had been killed by Attila when the latter saved Naomi. Kabir is arrested, but the officers allow Naomi to ride with him. Kabir asks if they can stop at a convenience store, where he buys Naomi a backpack and school supplies. He asks her if she can manage until he returns, to which she nods. The film ends with him asking her for a hug, to which she agrees. Cast * John Abraham as Kabir Ahlawat a.k.a.

Born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, she conducted research in the fields of histology and marine biology, utilizing organisms such as silkworms, limpets, earthworms, and frogs. Hibbard dedicated most of her life to education as a professor at multiple institutions, including Bryn Mawr College, Elmira College, and Oberlin College. She received accolades for her research and academic merits, such as the Sarah Berliner Fellowship and the Adelia A. Field Johnston Professor of Zoology. Hibbard is not only remembered for her intellectual endeavors, but for her support of women in the scientific sphere and her involvement in associations that forwarded female roles in science and research, such as the American Association of University Women (AAUW).  Early life and education  Hibbard was born to parents Mary (n√© Scofield) Hibbard and Herbert Wade Hibbard in 1893. Her father worked as a mechanical engineering professor. Hibbard entered college at the University of Missouri, where she completed her undergraduate degree in zoology in 1916. She subsequently studied to earn her master's degree, also in zoology, from the University of Missouri in 1918. From there, she elected to complete her Ph. D in zoology from Bryn Mawr College while additionally serving as a demonstrator for Bryn Mawr's biology department until 1921. The doctoral research conducted her Ph.D. in zoology focused on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs. After accepting a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree, Hibbard began her occupational journey as a professor at Elmira College. She first served as an associate professor, remaining at Elmira for four years. In the year 1926, Hibbard was honored with the Sarah Berliner Fellowship, a one-year educational opportunity provided by the AAUW which allowed her to study and work as a labarotory preparateur at the University of Paris. During that time, Hibbard's laboratory position centered around comparative anatomy techniques, which allowed her to conduct research of her own. After her fellowship ended, Hibbard was able to extend her European education for one more year with the support of the International Education Board. Her two years of education and research concerning the oogenesis of frog eggs consummated a doctorate of science from the Sorbonne.  Academia  Upon her return to the United States in 1928, Hibbard accepted the position of assistant professor in the zoology department at Oberlin College in Ohio. She devoted the next 34 years of her life at the college, occupying several different positions and titles. For 33 of her 34 years at Oberlin, she was the only female faculty member of the zoology department. Hibbard was promoted to an associate professor after serving just three years at Oberlin, and in an additional three years, she rose to the rank of full professor. This series of advancements in her professorship was almost unheard of for women during Hibbard's time; the standard progression of women professors was a drawn-out process, and female professors were commonly made to either wait for the completion an installed interval of time determined by international guidelines before rising in rank or remain at their current rank. Her steady elevation in the zoology department was therefore unorthodox in her day and age. Hibbard's research conducted while at Oberlin concentrated on a variety of fields, including cytology, histology, and marine biology. Her histological studies pinpointed research concerning organs and tissues of several marine invertebrates, including limpets, earthworms, silkworms, and squid. Her cytological research was conducted on the Golgi apparatus. She additionally worked as a trustee at the Woods Holes Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts during her professorship at Oberlin. in 1952, Hibbard received the title of Adelia A. Field Johnston Professor of Zoology, an esteemed promotion her department. Two years later, after 24 years of teaching at Oberlin College, Hibbard mean her four-year term as department chair.  Advocacy for women in science  Hibbard is viewed as a crusader for women in the scientific sphere. She held strong opinions about the untapped abilities of women due to both perpetuated stereotypes initialized by men and additional self-deprecating tendencies, and she utilized her membership in several academic assemblies to express her viewpoints. Hibbard served as an avid member of the AAUW and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, among others, and wrote several discourses in which she urged women to integrate marriage and professional endeavors within science rather than abandoning one from the other. Examples of Hibbard's papers include \\"Vocations for Women and How College Can Prepare Them\\" (1935), \\"The Life of Oberlin Women Today\\" (1937), and \\"Women in Research.\\" In these multiple dialogues, Hibbard communicated her desire for women to overcome social boundaries concerning their position in science. She worked to encourage women to forge their paths independent of discouraging social views and to mold their own journey as both intellectuals and spouses, as opposed to exclusively one of the two. Hibbard additionally spearheaded the Oberlin chapter of League of Women Voters while a professor at the institution.  Death and legacy  Hibbard died at the age of 94 in 1988, one year after becoming an honorary life member of the AAUW. Oberlin College honored her memory by establishing the Hope Hibbard Memorial Award shortly following her death.

Some ampelographers speculate that grape may be related to Sangiovese due to morphological similarities. Barsaglina was near extinction until a Tuscan wine producer, Paolo Storchi, help revive the variety by making it a significant component of his red Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) Toscana blend. The grape is also permitted to be used in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines of Colli di Luni.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours, pgs 91, 1129-1130 Allen Lane 2012 History Ampelographers have noted the morphological similarities between Sangiovese (pictured) and Barsaglina which may suggest a close relationship between the two varieties. Ampelographers believe that the Ligurian synonym Massaretta could be derived from the province of Massa and Carrara in Tuscany that borders Liguria and hints at the potential birthplace of Barsaglina. Morphological similarities in the vine, leaves and cluster of the variety has also suggested to some ampelographers that there may be a potential relationship with the notable Tuscan wine grape Sangiovese. While Barsaglina has a had a long history of cultivation around Carrara and Massa, the grape was on the verge of extinction in the late 20th century until a Tuscan wine producer, Paolo Storchi, revived plantings of the variety at his Podere Scurtarola estate (much the same way Storchi help revived Vermentino nero). Viticulture Barsaglina is a mid- ripening grape variety that is often harvested near the end of September. The vine can be very vigorous and prone to producing a large canopy of foliage if not kept in check by pruning and canopy management techniques. Among the viticultural hazards that Barsaglina is most susceptible to is the fungal infection of powdery mildew. Wine regions Barsaglina is most widely planted in the province of Massa and Carrara in northwest Tuscany. In 2000, there were less than of Barsaglina planted in Italy, mostly in the province of Massa and Carrara in northwest Tuscany. Across the border in Liguria, some limited plantings of the grape are also found where it is known locally as Massaretta. The grape is currently permitted in several IGT wines, including the generic Toscana IGT and Val di Magra which runs through the province of Massa and Carrara. The grape is also permitted in the DOC wines of Colli di Luna in Tuscany. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Barsaglina tends to make deeply colored and tannic wines, due to the high anthocyanin and phenolic content of the grapes, with aromas of dark fruit and violets.

Written in the span of ten years, from 2002 to 2012, the play is a response to and polemic with the German playwright Heiner Mueller's Hamletmachine (in German, Die Hamletmaschine). Like Hamletmachine, Opheliamachine is loosely based on Hamlet, by William Shakespeare. The play originated in relation to Romanska's doctoral dissertation on representation of death and femininity. Some critics believe that in Hamletmachine, Mueller deconstructs the impossible position of an Eastern European intellectual at the peak of the Cold War as well as the seemingly disappearing agency of the author. Likewise, Opheliamachine captures the current historical moment with all its entrapments: the dissolution of national and gender identities, the loss of agency and the solipsism of contemporary lives in an increasingly fragmented‚Äîif connected‚Äîworld, the brutal, animal-like quality of modern relationships, the collapse of a social order and its distinction, the chaos and violence that follows.  Overview  Written in the tradition of such experimental texts as Pablo Picasso's The Four Little Girls (1946‚Äì47), Antoni Artaud's Jet of Blood (1925), or Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi (1896), Opheliamachine is a collage, pastiche, conglomeration of images that rule over our modern, global, virtual sexuality. The play doesn‚Äôt have a plot as such. It is a postmodern tale of love and sex in a fragmented world of questionable values. Hamlet and Ophelia are represented by multiple characters, each in conflict with him- or herself and the other. Opheliamachine captures the dissolution of the national (local, sexual, etc.) identities leading to the kind of physical and psychological displacement that used to be the traditional immigrant, diasporic condition and which now has become the new normalized global mode of being, a new human condition. The play was inspired by Witold Gombrowicz‚Äô concept of \\"filistria: the realm of displaced persons of uncertain gender and sexuality living in a postcolonial - and now postideological ‚Äì world.\\" In a modern global world of unstable national and sexual identities, Hamlet and Ophelia are both what Fouad Ajami calls \\"children of the fault lines,\\" \\"rootless residents\\" for whom \\"home is neither in the lands of their birth nor in the diaspora communities where people flee the fire and the failure of tormented places.\\" Hamlet from Opheliamachine is the postmodern \\"nowhere man,\\" who finds the comfort of belonging in the virtual reality of TV and the Internet, and \\"who [has] risen to war against the very messy world that forged [him].\\" Ophelia is split between contradictory drives and desires, turning to self-violence in a grotesque gesture of gender mockery.  Premiere  Opheliamachine premiered in June 2013, at City Garage Theatre Company in Santa Monica, CA. Founded in 1987, City Garage has since presented more than two dozen \\"Critic‚Äôs Choice\\" or \\"Pick of the Week\\" productions. Its production history includes groundbreaking experimental texts by Neil LaBute, Sarah Kane, Heiner Mueller and Charles Mee.  The Company  The cast consisted of Joss Glennie Smith (Hamlet), Leah Harf (Therapist/Talk Show Host), Kat Johnston (Ophelia-Writer), RJ Jones (Horatio), Megan Kim (Ophelia-Fighter), Cynthia Mance (Gertrude), Saffron Mazzia (Ophelia-Traveler). It was directed by Frederique Michel, and produced and designed by Charles A. Duncombe.  Critical reception  The City Garage production of Opheliamachine was critically acclaimed, receiving a slew of positive reviews from many LA-based media. Radio station KCRW (local NPR affiliate) picked Opheliamachine as \\"Thing to See\\" among \\"Five Things To Do\\" in LA over a 4 July weekend. In the podcast about the show, Anthony Byrnes said: > The play itself, written by Magda Romanska, is a series of scenes that > explore the themes of femininity, power, sex, rage, love, and madness > through a faceted portrayal of Ophelia. Our title character is split in > three: we have Ophelia the Brain‚Äîtyping away at a vintage typewriter > complete with bell; Ophelia the terrorist clad in black fatigues with a .45 > tucked into her bare midriff; and finally Ophelia the Mad confined to a > wedding dress and, at times, a wheelchair. [‚Ä¶] If you‚Äôre looking for a play > or a company that ties everything into neat little knots‚Äîthis probably isn‚Äôt > for you.

Hindus have been living in Canada for over a century, especially in Edmonton. Fijian Hindus began to settle in Edmonton in larger proportions starting in the 1960s and 1970s. They conducted prayers and meditated in individual households via groups they formed in the community. Talks of the need of a temple started in 1983 by four major Hindu Bhakti groups in Edmonton at the time, Shree Sanatan Dharam Ramayan Society, Edmonton Geeta Ramayan Congregation, Edmonton Vedic Congregation and later joined by Edmonton Prem Society, the group founded the Sanatan Board and raised funds to buy a property for the temple.http://www.vishnumandiredmonton.com/history/ It became the first Fijian Hindu cultural society in all of Canada, and till date is the largest. It started as a small place of worship in the Balwin residential area, constructed out of an old Church building. Since then it has been renovated 2 times, first adding a basement, then in 2006 expanded further making it the second largest Hindu temple in Edmonton.Temple Festivals Calendar Hindu Temple Collections Hindu Temples outside of India Hindu Temples in Canada Mandir and Daily Rituals While it is open every morning from 7:15AM-8:15AM, the Mandir is also open for prayers Monday for Shiva Pooja, Tuesdays for Hanuman Pooja, and primarily on Friday evenings for Maha Lakshmi Pooja, along with many festivals practised in the Hindu faith.

It is directed by Mahesh Kothare. The film is a remake of the Tamil movie Kaadhalikka Neramillai (1964),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/photofeatures/laxmikant- berde-superhit-comedy-films-of-the-actor-you-should-not- miss/zapatlela/photostory/63415234.cms which was also remade earlier in Telugu as Preminchi Choodu (1965), in Hindi as Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966) and in Kannada as Preethi Madu Thamashe Nodu (1979). Synopsis Dhanaji Wakade is an arrogant and greedy industrialist. Seema and Gauri are his daughters and Laxmikant is his son. Mahesh Javalkar is an employee in his company. Gauri and Mahesh decide to marry but Dhanaji does not approve of his daughter marrying someone below his social status. Dhanaji's son Laxmikant is an aspiring film maker and desires to marry the daughter of Mr. Rede, who also is not as rich as Dhanaji. To overcome Dhanaji's resistance, Mahesh decides to take help of his friend Ashok. They decide that Ashok would disguise himself as a very rich old man and introduce himself to Dhanaji as Mahesh's father. They know that Dhanaji would be impressed by his show of wealth and allow his daughter to marry Mahesh. When disguised Ashok reaches Dhanaji's house he notices that Dhanaji is father of Seema. Ashok and Seema already know each other and desire to marry each other. Ashok discloses his identity to Seema. Mahesh discloses Ashok's identity to Gauri. Laxmikant, too, accidentally discovers Ashok's truth. Disguised Ashok tells Dhanaji that he wants to marry his elder daughter Seema. Dhanaji is so impressed by the (claimed) wealth of disguised Ashok that he agrees to his proposal. Ashok's father is a friend of Dhanaji. He arrives at Dhanaji's town for some business purpose and halts at Dhanaji's house, but he does not recognize Ashok who is in disguise as an old bearded man. After some time Mahesh's father arrives at Dhanaji's house because he has not received any news from Mahesh for past few months. Now Dhanaji is confronted with two fathers of Mahesh. When Mahesh arrives at Dhanaji's house, he points at Ashok as his real father because he does not want to put his marriage plan in danger. Dhanaji hands over Mahesh's real father to police thinking him to be an imposter. Ashok guesses that the police would easily confirm the identity of Mahesh's father and then Ashok and Mahesh would be considered as frauds. So Mahesh, Ashok, Seema and Gauri elope in Mahesh's vehicle. They are joined by Laxmikant and Rede's daughter who also want to get married against their parents' wish. When Dhanaji notices their absence, he chases Mahesh's vehicle. He is accompanied by Ashok's father and Mahesh's father. Mahesh's vehicle takes a turn which Dhanaji does not notice and they start chasing another similar vehicle which is occupied by thieves. Chasing the thieves they reach the hiding place of the thieves. There the thieves attack them but Ashok, Mahesh and Laxmikant reach there on time and overpower the thieves. Police arrives and arrests the thieves. Dhanaji realises his folly and allows his three children to marry as per their choice. The story of this film is similar to that of the Hindi film Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966) which itself was based on the Tamil comedy Kaadhalikka Neramillai (1964) which was remade into a Telugu movie as Preminchi Choodu (1965).

Lupo has also conducted research on La Nina years and how they tend to be hotter than typical years, as occurred in the US Midwest in 1889 and 2012. Views on global warming Lupo is an outspoken global warming skeptic, acknowledging that human activity contributes to global warming but putting more faith in the view that it is a natural phenomenon. Lupo's skepticism and receipt of funding ($750 per month) from the Heartland Institute have generated controversy. Lupo says the work Heartland pays him to do does not directly relate to causes of global warming, but rather \\"interpret[ing] them [scientific studies] in a form that somebody can understand and digest.\\" He has also said that he is not violating any conflict-of-interest rules by receiving this money. Lupo spoke at the International Conference on Climate Change in July 2014. Weather predictions Lupo regularly makes predictions regarding the weather in Missouri, based on historical patterns and statistics (unlike the weatherman's forecast covering only next week). For example, shortly before Christmas in 2012 he predicted that ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much chance for a white Christmas this year.‚Äù In addition, in February 2013, he predicted that the summer of 2013 will not be as dry in Missouri as that of 2012, when the state, as well as much of the rest of the United States, suffered one of the most extreme droughts in its history.

It was part of the Bundelkhand Agency and later the Central India Agency. The princely state of Khaniadhana, was made of several small enclaves, bounded on the east by the British district of Jhansi but otherwise completely surrounded by the Narwar district of Gwalior State. Khaniadhana State was part of the Gwalior Residency. It was located to the west of Orchha State. It covered a total area of 101 sq m spread over 55 villages and the total population of the territory during the British rule was 20,124 as per census of 1941. History In 1724, Raja Udot Singh of Orchha State granted Khaniadhana and several other villages to his son Amar Singh. When the Marathas became the paramount power in Bundelkhand, the Peshwa granted Amar Singh a sanad in 1751 confirming him in his grant. After this time, suzerainty was always in dispute between Orchha and the Maratha state of Jhansi, the Peshwa‚Äôs eventual successor. When Jhansi State lapsed in 1854, the Khanadhiana jagirdar claimed absolute independence. The matter was only settled in 1862 when Khaniadhana was declared to be directly dependent from the British government as successor to the Jhansi darbar and the Peshwa. The State was one of the original constituent members of the Chamber of Princes, an institution established in 1920.David P. Henige, Princely states of India: a guide to chronology and rulers, Orchid Press, 2004 pp:104-5 In 1948, the Khaniadhana State acceded to the Union of India and about half of Khaniadhana (27 villages) was included in Shivpuri district of Madhya Bharat while the other half (28 villages) was included in Vindhya Pradesh., which all are now part of Madhya Pradesh. =Rulers= The ruling family of Khaniadhana were Bundela Rajputs. The ruler of the princely state of Khaniadhana held the hereditary title of Rao or Jagirdar, but from the year 1911, the ruler was granted the title and style of Raja. It was a non-salute state and the native ruler or the Raja of the princely state exercised the powers and authority of a ruling chief. Rajas *1724‚Äì17. .

Plot Cheung Ka-wah (Andy Lau) and his older brother, Ka-wai (David Lam) are entering Hong Kong illegally with their parents on a refugee ship. During the way, their sickly mother dies due to lack of oxygen in the deck before the Chinese coast guards approach the ship leading to a firefight between the guards and the refugees on ship and their father was killed in the gunfire. Ka-wah picks up a pistol and fires at the guards being getting shot and jumps into the sea, successfully sneaking into Hong Kong and was rescued by a boat girl, Kiu (Irene Wan), and her grandfather who nurse him back to health. On the other hand, Ka-wai was captured and deported back to mainland China and forced to work as a labour in a mine quarry. After arriving in for Hong Kong, Ka-wai is unable to sustain a long term job due to getting into fights with other workers who bully him for being from China, so he decides to set up a stall selling Red bean ice in Sai Wan, but triad thugs arrive to extort protection fee from him and he beats them up and his stall was destroyed during the process. Angered, Ka-wah confronts their boss, Tong Fai (Michael Chan) in Wan Lai Tea Room, where Fai was gambling against his rival in the same triad, Fat Hoi (Shum Wai), in a bird fight. Ka-wah storms in the tea room and destroys Fai's bird cage and beats up several of his henchmen before being outnumbered, but Fai recognizes Ka-wah's courage and fighting skills and takes him as his underling and treats him like a son. Meanwhile, Fat Hoi convinces his boss (Ku Feng) to traffick cocaine but Fai opposes it, which their boss agrees, so Fat Hoi retaliates by hiring outside thugs from a triad in Sheung Wan to start on fight in Ka-wah and Kiu's wedding. Their boss finds out about this and punishes Fat Hoi, who bites back by framing Fai for cocaine possession, which causes the latter to be sentenced to prison for seven years. Fai persuades Ka-wah to leave as far away as possible can to avoid any danger, so he moves to Keelung, Taiwan with Kiu and, changing his name to Cheung Tin-chau, and works in a shipping company owned by the latter's uncle. With Fai in prison, Fat Hoi was able to manipulate his boss into dealing with Thai drug lords and do big business. Seven years later, Ka-wah, who has a daughter, San-san, with Kiu, who is also pregnant with their second child, takes over the shipping company from Kiu's uncle due to the latter's ailing health. On the other hand, Fat Hoi has earned a fortune from drug trafficking becomes the main leader of Chung Sing Tong Gang and also owns a transportation company to traffick cocaine. However, Fat Hoi's advisor, So advises him to invest in some legitimate business since the British government is working on building an anti-corruption agency in Hong Kong and suggests him to hire mainland Chinese criminals to rob an armoured car to obtain funds, so Fat Hoi hires three thugs for the job, which one of them is Ka-wai. Afterward, Fat Hoi's Thai business partner offers to smuggle HK$10 million worth of cocaine to Taiwan with him and wants to collaborate with Ka-wah's company, but Ka-wah refuses, so Fat Hoi goes to Keelung to negotiate with Ka-wah, who beats up his henchmen after they start a fight in his company and warns Fat Hoi to leave Taiwan within 24 hours. Fat Hoi then sends Ka-wai to Keelung and kidnap San-san, but he accidentally suffocates her to death while evading the police, leaving him in shock and feels very remorseful. Ka-wah then returns to Hong Kong to seek revenge on Fat Hoi while Kiu is in the hospital, soon to be ready to deliver their second child. Back in Hong Kong, Ka-wah notices Fai working as a window washer for Fat Hoi and become addicted to cocaine because the latter's henchmen in prison forced him to take the drug, and Ka-wah is determined to help him kick his addiction. However, Fat Hoi sends Ka-wai and a Vietnamese henchman (Dick Wei) to kill Ka-wah at Fai's hideout, where Fai is killed by the Vietnamese henchman, and Ka-wai eventually notices Ka-wah during the scuffle and kills the Vietnamese henchman instead. Ka-wah brings his brother back to his hotel room and sees Kiu, who witnessed and remembers Ka- wai as her daughter's kidnapper and killer, leaving Ka-wai feeling extreme guilt knowing he killed his own niece. When Ka-wai goes out to shop, Kiu attempts to stab Ka-wai, who stops her before leaving to seek revenge on Fat Hoi at a banquet celebration, but Fat Hoi stabs him and holds him hostage. Ka- wah returns shortly and after Kiu tells him about their daughter's murder, he notices an announcement of Fat Hoi's banquet on the newspaper and goes there armed with a hand saw and slaughters most of Fat Hoi's henchmen before Ka-wai frees snd unties himself and Kiu (who arrived before her husband), and joins his brother in killing the rest of the henchmen. When the police arrive, Ka- wai pushes his brother away and stabs Fat Hoi to death, resulting in him being gunned down by the police.

Due to the geometry of the anode, X-rays emitted towards the cathode are in general more intense than those emitted perpendicular to the cathode‚Äìanode axis. The effect stems from the absorption of X-ray photons before they leave the anode in which they are produced. The probability of absorption depends on the distance the photons travel within the anode material, which in turn depends on the direction of emission. Factors =Source to Image Distance (SID)= The distance from the anode (source of X-rays) to the image receptor greatly influences the apparent magnitude of the anode heel effect. The shorter the distance, the less space the beam has to diverge. The effect is less noticeable at larger source-image distances (SID). =Beam and receptor size= Diagnostic X-ray beams can be collimated to large or small beams. A large beam will emit more intensities of the beam along the cathode-anode axis than a small beam. A large image receptor will also capture more of this beam than a small receptor. Both of these factors will greatly influence the visibility of the anode heel effect. A smaller field size results in a less pronounced heel effect. =Anode angle= When the angle of the anode is great, the usable X-ray photons will not have to travel through as much of the anode material to exit the tube. This results in a much less apparent anode heel effect, though the effective focal spot size is increased. Solutions Almost all modern diagnostic x-ray machines exhibit the heel effect to some degree. Its effect on images is mostly avoided through consideration of patient positioning. For example, when imaging a foot which is thicker at the ankle end than the toes, the toes should be positioned towards the anode and the ankle towards the cathode. There have also been some efforts to eliminate the heel effect through automatic software adjustment of pixel values.

Masters. Published in 1970, the book explores the sexual practices and rituals of various ethnic groups from India, Africa, and South-East Asia. Edwardes authored multiple novels that claimed to explore eroticism and sexuality outside of Western culture.Roland Boer, Orientalist Camp: The Case of Allen Edwardes (Australia: University of Newcastle Press, 2012), 133 Edwardes‚Äô Erotica Judaica investigates the sexual history of the Jews. Edwardes‚Äô also penned The Jewel in the Lotus: A historical survey of the sexual culture in the East, a novel that analyzes peculiar sexual behaviors of Asian ethnographies. R.E.L Masters is a close confidant of Edwardes. Masters's novels focused on human conscientious and potential.Robert Masters, husband of Jean Houston, has passed away. July 30, 2008 Together these two authors crafted The Cradle of Erotica to supposedly examine and access sexual activities of Afro-Asian cultures. Summary =Philosophy= Edwardes and Masters begin this chapter by explaining the importance of copulation in both the Muslim and Hindu faiths. The Turkish writer Khojeh ‚ÄôOmar Halebi Abbbu ‚ÄòOthman, author of the Book of the Secrets Laws of Love, details how Allah and Eros, Greek for intimate love, are one of the same divine law . This divine attraction between man and woman is mirrored in Hindu belief. Wang Shih-cheng explains how this attraction is as natural as the Earth and one cannot blame this attraction on evil.Allen Edwardes & R.E.L Masters, The Cradle of Erotica: A Study of Afro-Asian Sexual Expression and an Analysis of Erotic Freedom in Social Relationships (London: The Odyssey Press, 1970),1 Edwardes and Masters then address and explain the matriarchal dominance of sex in Afro-Asian sexual practices, especially those relationships seen in the Muslim faith. Conservative Muslims believe the liberation of women from their natural position of subservience in Muslim culture is a pathway to indulgencing in lustful sex without shame. Differing from the intimate love synonymous with Allah, lustful sex is strictly for physical enjoyment, while intimate sex is a connection in both spirit and body.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica. 11-14 This chapter then goes on to describe the allegedly lascivious natures of Hinduism and the Chinese. This supposedly endless thirst for sexual activity in Oriental ethos is compared to various animals.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica 9-12 This chapter introduces belief systems that widely differ from those of Western sexuality and this trend is carried throughout the other chapters of this book. =Genitalia= This chapter is almost exclusively dedicated to the various sizes and measurements of the genitals of Afro-Asian peoples. Comparisons between humans and animals are common throughout this chapter. Addressing the vagina, the authors claim that each ethnic and or religious group has their own opinion of the variations of the vagina.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,27-28 The morphology of the clitoris in certain ethnicities renders place names that distinguish them from their other Afro-Asian cousins.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 32-34 This variation is not seen with the descriptions and measurements of the various penises of Afro-Asian men. In fact, Edwardes and Masters cite Sir Richard Burton's and Dr. Jacobus observations and measurements as solid facts in regards to the penises of various ethnicities.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,29-31 This chapter also explores specific parts of the penis, such as the glans and its coloration, as further means of distinction between the ethnicities of Afro-Asian.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,43 =Genital intercourse= This chapter states how many Afro-Asian cultures refer to copulation as an art. The descriptions and analysis of various sexual techniques, practiced by men and or women, comprises the core material of this chapter. The authors claim that Coitus prolongatus, the process of delaying the ejaculation of a male in order to accelerate the female orgasm, is a sexual technique practiced by Muslim and Hindu men.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 47-48 Themes of sadomasochism and violence are examined in Islamic, Hindu, and Egyptian sexual folklore. In Egypt, the title of abu ÃÖ hhimla ÃÖt, which translates to father of assaults, is a label of pride, boasting of a man's voracious lovemaking.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,55-57 Aphrodisiacs are also mentioned in detail throughout this chapter. The authors claim that opium and marijuana, specifically hashish, are used by many Afro-Asian cultures in order to enhance their sexual experiences. Opium is used to excite the imagination and dull the senses, while hashish is used to desensitize and prolong the erection of a penis.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,61-63 The authors claim that a female under the influence of hashish had the purported ability to have consecutive vaginal and anal sex with over one hundred men . = Promiscuity = This chapter examines the institution of marriage in Afro-Asian culture. The authors describe men of ease as Arabian men who profit from the sexual exploitation of their wives, sisters, daughters, or any other female relative. Their female counterparts, loose women, are wives that participate in prostitution. Edwardes and Masters quote the French army surgeon Dr. Jacobus, who calculaste that over 80% of Arabian married couples are involved in adultery. North African Arabian women have reported that they have engaged in sex with more than one man at one time. This act not only conflicts with the Western belief of a monogamous sexual partner, but questions the Western philosophy of two men having sex with the same female as homosexual. This thought is cemented with evidence of Arabian and Egyptian dancers having gaping vaginal orifices. This lust for polyandry is also evident in Arabian women engaging in copulation with several males at once in erotic parlor games.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 88-89 =Anal intercourse= This chapter explores anal intercourse in Afro-Asian sexual culture. The chapter starts with the biological explanation of why a man would be drawn to the anus. The anal sphincter contains a greater contractile power than the vagina, and this allows the male greater pleasure through increased friction.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 104 The chapter continues to claim that anal intercourse is a routine practice among many Muslim women. The authors claim that Indonesian and Malayan people also routinely practice sodomy. Chinese Muslims and Buddhists are also notorious for using their servant boys as means of sexual release.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 114-115 =Masturbation= Edwardes and Masters attribute the prevalence of masturbation in Afro-Asian societies to the sleeping and living patterns of children. Two or more young boys often share a room, even a bed in some cases, which often leads to genital play. Patterns of behavior are then formed. In the East, young boys follow a regular pattern of manual and oral stimulation. Those boys who refuse this genital play are rejected and labeled as sexless hermaphrodites.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,119 Jewish and Muslim boys also engage in this social masturbation. Masturbation is not explicit to young boys. Allegedly, North African Jewish girls perform acts of masturbation with their male relatives. The male relative often reciprocates the act. Sadomasochist themes, which were mentioned in the Genital Intercourse chapter, are also evident in feminine masturbation. Female masturbation is seen as an outlet for girls‚Äô frustration and aggressiveness.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 138-139 =Oral intercourse= Edwardes and Masters label early Egyptians as the first peoples to commercialize fellatio. Egyptian women would apply lipstick to their lips in order to mimic the appearance of the vulva. Cleopatra, who wore lipstick herself, was said to have performed fellatio on over 1,000 men.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 153 The rest of the chapter investigates specific examples of fellatio in Afro-Asian cultures. Certain brothels in Northern and Eastern Africa are specialized in the art of qerdz, or sucking. Arabian, Indian, and African women have all supposedly been found to be employed at these brothels.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 155 When their husbands are away from work, Sa‚Äôudi Arabia women are mentioned as performing fellatio to random males. Men living in Mecca create concubines of women in order to fulfill their sexual hunger, specifically cunnilingus.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 156-158 Fellatio is also witnessed between men and their boy servants.Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 162-163 Critical reception =Orientalism= Allen Edwardes and R.E.L Masters have been accused of orientalism. Orientalism is the patronizing, and often racist, Western thought surrounding the beliefs and practices of cultures located in India, Eastern Asia, or the Middle East. Joseph Boone uses orientalism as his weapon of demystification against Edwardes and Masters fictional portrayal of Eastern sexuality.Joseph A. Boone, Vacation Cruises; Or, the Homoerotics of Orientalism (New York: Modern Language Association, 1995), 90 Boone states that homosexuality is recognized and glorified in Eastern sexuality in order to make Western, white, civilization more pure and civilized. He uses the obsession with the penis sizes of Egyptians and Arabian men in The Cradle of Erotica as his perfect example of the sublimation. Through a complicated method of execution, Edwardes and Masters use exotic Eastern sexuality as a platform of expressing Western homosexual thought, without sacrificing any supposed homologous sexual belief that is supposedly shared among all Western people.Boone, Vacation Cruises; Or, the Homoerotics of Orientalism, 94.

The city was taken back on 5 July 2014 after shelling from artillery and heavy fighting. The fighting in Sloviansk marked the first major military engagement between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces, in the first run of battles in 2014. On 12 April 2014, as unrest grew in eastern Ukraine following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, masked men in fatigues, armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles, captured the city administration building. These men, who claimed to be pro- Russian fighters under the banner of the Donetsk People's Republic, subsequently gained control of the rest of Sloviansk and began to fortify it. In response, the Ukrainian Yatsenyuk Government created the first Anti- Terrorist Operations zone (ATO) and launched a series of counter-offensives against the insurgents, resulting in a standoff and violent skirmishes. As tensions in the city increased, the insurgents began to take journalists and others captive, instigating a hostage crisis. The Security Service of Ukraine said on 18 April that \\"Sloviansk remains the hottest point in the region\\".

On 12 April, a group of masked militants, which was formed in Crimea and led by former officer of Russian security services Igor Girkin, captured the executive committee building, the police department, and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU, Sluzhba Bezpeky Ukrayiny) offices in Sloviansk, a city in the northern part of the Donetsk Oblast. According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry the militant supporters of the Donetsk Republic fired indiscriminately on the building. Raiding the police armoury, the militants seized at least 400 handguns and 20 automatic weapons. \\"The aim of the takeover was the guns,\\" a Ukrainian police statement said. \\"They are giving these guns to participants in the protest in Sloviansk.\\". After takeover of the city by militants, Sloviansk mayor Nelya Shtepa briefly appeared at an occupied police station and expressed support for the militants. Others gathered outside the building and similarly voiced their support for the militants. They told Ukrainian journalists who were reporting on the situation to \\"go back to Kiev\\". Nelya Shtepa was later arrested by the insurgents, and replaced by the self-proclaimed \\"people's mayor\\" Vyacheslav Ponomarev. =Government response= The following morning the Ukrainian government announced a counter-terrorism operation in the city. An ultimatum was given for the separatists to disarm and surrender to authorities within 48 hours. Police began the operation by clearing a highway checkpoint controlled by separatists. A group of insurgents exited their vehicle and opened fire on the Ukrainian police, killing two SBU officers and injuring several Ukrainian military personnel. One separatist was also killed in the shootout, while the remainder fled into the woods. The car the gunmen were in had a Poltava Oblast license plate, which was traced to the private security firm Yavir. In an unrelated shootout in the city itself, two people were shot dead by an assailant in plainclothes, and another was wounded. By the next day Sloviansk was reported to be under pro-Russian control, with more important government buildings and other areas taken by the militants. The Ukrainian army ground forces were deployed on the same day, after the separatists declined the ultimatum to lay down their arms. Two civilians were shot and killed at point blank range by pro-Russian militants in a car in Sloviansk; another one was wounded. Masked armed men walking around the city =First offensive= Ukrainian forces launched their first military offensive to regain control of the Kramatorsk regional air base, using transport helicopters and armoured vehicles. Militants attempted to regain control of the airport resulted in heavy fighting but were not successful. Russian media estimated that this clash resulted in between four and eleven deaths. The leader of the government military operation, General Vasyl Krutov, was attacked by pro-Russian sympathizers after addressing a crowd demonstrating in front of the air base. Ukrainian armoured units were reported to be encircling Sloviansk to blockade all approach routes. Armed militiamen occupying the council building on April 14. First Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Yarema claimed that elements of the 45th Russian airborne division were seen in the Sloviansk area on 16 April. Six Ukrainian armoured vehicles drove through Sloviansk bearing Russian flags, after their crews had apparently defected to the separatist cause. The 25th Airborne Brigade that had been blockading Sloviansk was then disbanded on orders of Ukraine's president. The government announced that the soldiers responsible would be court martialled. On 18 April, Sloviansk \\"people's mayor\\" Vyacheslav Ponomarev announced a \\"hunt\\" of the Ukrainian speakers in the Donetsk region, commanding the militants to report suspicious activity, especially if they heard that the Ukrainian language was used. Ukrainian media claimed that the Zhytomyr Armoured Brigade recaptured two of the six armoured vehicles near Kramatorsk late on 18 April. No fatalities were recorded while one separatist was wounded. Following negotiations, a compromise was reached to return the remaining four BMDs to the Ukrainian military, but an official from the Ministry of Defence announced that the vehicles were still in the hands of the rebels as of 23 April.–ú—ñ–Ω–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏: –£ —Å–µ–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç—ñ–≤ –∑–∞–ª–∏—à–∏–ª–∏—Å—è 4 –ë–ú–î.

Ukrinform, 26 April 2014 =Easter truce= Barricade in the city A truce for Easter was called by the Ukrainian government, which promised to temporarily halt military action in eastern Ukraine on 19 April. Pro-Russian members of the Donbass People's Militia began a pogrom targeting the Romani population of the town. According to the International Renaissance Foundation, a Ukrainian NGO, separatist militiamen entered houses inhabited by Romanis, beat the residents, including women and children, and stole their property. The militants claimed they were acting on orders from \\"people's mayor\\" and militant leader Vyacheslav Ponomarev. Reports of the attacks were confirmed by Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, as well as a heightened level of xenophobic rhetoric at separatist rallies. Prime Minister Yatsenyuk said that the government will not tolerate incitement of ethnic hatred and instructed law enforcement agencies to identify those involved in the attacks on Romani. According to Ponomarev, he held talks with Romani whom he alleged were involved in drug trafficking, and \\"removed them from the city.\\" Ponomarev said the incidents were not attacks on Romani, but rather \\"cleaning drugs out of the city.\\" Separatists kidnapped Euromaidan activist and journalist Irma Krat who had arrived in the city to cover the conflict. They later paraded her blindfolded in front of the press. On 20 April, 20 Right Sector members led by Dmytro Yarosh were covertly sent by acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov to destroy the transformer of the Slavyansk television station on Karachun mountain. When their four-car convoy attempted to pass an insurgent-controlled checkpoint, a gunfight broke out, leading to the first combat fatalities of the conflict. Subsequently, the insurgents' claimed that they were attacked by Right Sector, but this was denied by the Kyiv government until two years later, when Yarosh admitted that it was true (the two accounts continue to differ on which side shot first). Pro-Russian civilians in Sloviansk, 13 April 2014 The pro-Russian separatists in Sloviansk claimed to have confiscated firearms including a German World War II-era MG-42 machine gun, a night vision device, aerial photos of Sloviansk, military uniforms, camping tools, US cash, and an alleged Right Sector business card of presidential candidate Dmytro Yarosh. Right Sector symbols including a medallion were also claimed to have been found. Right Sector spokesman Artem Skoropadsky denied the group's involvement in the attack, and blamed Russian special forces for it. \\"We don't have ID cards with numbers. We only have ID cards with letters, where we mention the department where the person works,\\" said Boryslav Bereza, head of the information department for Right Sector. CNN called the phone number on the calling card and reached a woman who expressed surprise at the situation. She said that she was in Kyiv and had no relation to anyone in Right Sector. Viktoriya Siumar, deputy head of Ukraine's National Security Council, said the shooting was being investigated, but that there were indications that it was \\"an argument between local criminal groups\\". Sky News correspondent Katie Stallard said there were inconsistencies in the separatists' accounts and there was no coherent evidence to back up their claims. Daniel Sandford of the BBC described the evidence presented as \\"dubious\\". Barricades at entrance to a captured government building The video released by Russian TV which claimed to show the identifying badges of the Right Sector turned out to have been filmed ten hours before the actual attack took place, as evidenced by the time stamp which the Russian camera crew forgot to remove. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said at least three separatists were killed and three wounded in what it suspected might have been an incident set up by Russian agents. \\"Armed lawbreakers and saboteurs who are terrorizing the local population around Slaviansk ... have turned to cynical provocation,\\" the SBU security service said in a statement, describing the incident as a \\"staged attack\\". No group was present \\"other than the saboteurs and crime figures, supported and armed by officers of Russia's GRU\\" military intelligence, the SBU added. They also noted \\"One cannot but suspect the speed with which camera crews from Russian TV stations appeared at the scene of the shooting, and the obviously staged subject matter of news reports in the Russian media.\\" The alleged Dmytro Yarosh business card was widely mocked on Ukrainian and Russian social media. In 2016, on the two-year anniversary of the attack, Dmytro Yarosh talked to Censor.net, corroborating that he did in fact lead the attack (though the actual combat leader was an unnamed Afghan national), and gave a detailed account of it. Following the incident, \\"people's mayor\\" Ponomarov appealed to Russia to intervene militarily. Ponomarev then instituted a curfew in the city. It was later reported that the man killed at the checkpoint was Pavel Pavelko, a resident of the surrounding area. Civilians block Ukrainian military near Sloviansk, April 2014 Vehicle near Sloviansk with Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) markings OSCE monitors were barred from the city by the separatists on 21 April. An OSCE team \\"has been in Donetsk but has not yet made progress,\\" one diplomat said. \\"They are trying to get back into Slovyansk, but pro-Russian demonstrators have been blocking the way.\\" An OSCE assessment released Monday described the situation as \\"very tense\\" in Donetsk and as \\"deteriorating\\" in Sloviansk, where \\"the entire town is under the control of armed groups.\\" Ukrainian officials distributed photos to the U.N and U.S councils allegedly showing that pro-Russian militants were undercover Russian special forces. Other photos showed militants equipped and dressed the same as Russian soldiers in Crimea.Photos Link Masked Men in East Ukraine to Russia A Ukrainian military surveillance plane was damaged by small arms fire as it was on a reconnaissance flight over Sloviansk on 21 April, but safely made an emergency landing. None of the crew members were hurt. American journalist Simon Ostrovsky from Vice News was held captive by militants in the city. =Military operation resumes= On 23 April Ukraine's Interior Ministry said it had cleared separatist forces out of the nearby city of Sviatohirsk and that no one was injured. \\"During the anti-terrorism operation by special forces, the city was freed,\\" the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. \\"Currently Sviatohirsk and its surroundings are being patrolled by police.\\" Ponomarev promised to prevent presidential elections in Ukraine at any cost. He said, \\"We will take all necessary measures so that elections in the southeast do not take place\\". Asked how he would accomplish this, he responded, \\"We'll take somebody as hostage and hang him by the balls.\\" He also promised to destroy dissent, calling it \\"a harsh truth of life.\\" On 24 April, Ukrainian troops took control of three checkpoints surrounding the city, and according to the Interior Ministry, five separatists were killed and one police officer wounded in the attacks. The checkpoints were burned. Ukrainian forces distributed leaflets to residents of Sloviansk encouraging them to remain peaceful, and the Ministry reported that Ponomarev had announced that anyone seen with the leaflet would be \\"shot on the spot.\\" The leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic told Interfax-Ukraine that \\"a combined arms operation has been launched in Sloviansk. This means only one thing: a civil war.\\" Ukrainian officials said that the counter-insurgency operation intended to retake all of Sloviansk the same day, but an increased threat of a Russian invasion halted the operation ‚Äì Russian forces moved to within of the Ukrainian border. The government confirmed seven were killed during the operation. Ukrainian Forces surrounded Sloviansk supported by multiple armoured columns, and warned civilians to stay indoors ahead of a planned offensive on 25 April. The pro-Russian militant commander Ponomarev threatened to turn Sloviansk into a \\"Stalingrad\\" if Ukrainian troops were to enter the town. He also reported that only one checkpoint to the east of Sloviansk remained under separatist control, while the rest had been captured the previous day. =Government blockade= Ukrainian authorities said that the second phase of the military operation in Sloviansk would include blockading the city to prevent any reinforcements from entering. In the city, it was reported that pro-Russian militants had beaten children whom they caught photographing a separatist checkpoint. The news caused a backlash in residents' opinions of the militants. BBC journalist Natalia Antelava was threatened at gunpoint by members of the Donbass People's Militia while attempting to interview locals. Russian media, citing Russian Ministry of Defense analysis, reported that Ukrainian forces planned to wipe out the entire population of the city; this was denounced as propaganda in the Ukrainian press. On 26 April, the Ukrainian troops blockading the city began erecting checkpoints on roads leading to Sloviansk. On 28 April, self- proclaimed \\"deputy mayor\\" of Sloviansk, Igor Perepechayenko, was arrested by SBU officers. Officials claimed Perepechayenko had been establishing contact with the General staff of the Russian Armed Forces and the GRU, and was arrested at the Donetsk airport while returning from a flight from Moscow. Residents reported that gunmen from the Donbass militia began extorting shop owners in the local market for \\"rent\\" and had begun stealing expensive cars. =Second offensive= Locals look at a destroyed truck next to the Sloviansk sign During the early morning on 2 May, Ukrainian forces launched a large- scale operation to retake the city. There were reports of gunfire, explosions, and a military helicopter opening fire.

A police station was reportedly re-captured, while the city centre remained quiet. Several armoured vehicles were seen outside the city. Separatist authorities claim that three militants and two civilians were killed in the clashes. The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs reports that up to nine checkpoints around Sloviansk were seized.

Korrespondent.net, 2 May 2014 Ukrainian National Guard Commander Stepan Poltorak said that the town has been practically cleared of terrorists. After the helicopters were shot down, Ukrainian authorities stated that it was done with Russian man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS). Jane's Information Group editor and military analyst Nicholas de Larrinaga says that the use of \\"MANPADS outside of formal armed forces has historically been very rare\\" and that the type used was an Igla model, either the earlier 9K310 Igla-1 (SA-16 'Gimlet'), or the later 9K38 Igla (SA-18 'Grouse'), which are in service with both the Ukrainian and Russian armed forces. An independent Russian military journalist, Pavel Felgenhauer, said that the effective usage of MANPADS in Ukraine proved not only that the people who used it were specially trained, but that the weaponry was supplied by Russia. According to Felgenhauer, Soviet MANPADS would not be functioning right away, as they were equipped with a short-lived battery. On the other hand, MANPADS of the Ukrainian army (type Igla) would not hit a Ukrainian helicopter, because such systems have a friend-or-foe identification ability. During the fighting, about one hundred civilians gathered outside the city hall to appeal for Russian intervention. On 5 May, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that Ukrainian soldiers were killed in fighting with pro-Russian separatists on the outskirts of the city, and said the separatists, numbering as many as 800, fired \\"large-caliber weapons,\\" and \\"used mortars and other equipment.\\" Four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and twenty more were wounded in fighting. He claimed 30 \\"terrorists\\" were killed, and dozens wounded. Strelkov, Donbass Militia leader, told the Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti that \\"We lost around 10, including peaceful residents, and 20‚Äì25 were wounded.\\" According to a statement on the Interior Ministry's website, separatists used unarmed civilians as human shields as they attacked Ukrainian troops and set fire to nearby buildings, and fired at a minibus that was carrying wounded people from the battlefield, killing an officer in a special police unit who was escorting it. Pro-Russian insurgents also shot down a Ukrainian M-24 helicopter in Sloviansk using a heavy machine gun. =Post-referendum= Following the referendum of the status of Donetsk Oblast, on 12 May, Donbass People's Militia leader Igor Girkin declared himself \\"Supreme Commander\\" of the Donetsk People's Republic. In his decree, he demanded all military stationed in the region swear an oath of allegiance to him within 48 hours, and said that war would be waged upon those who did not. This was followed on 15 May by a deputy of Strelkov issuing a second ultimatum at a press conference, giving Ukraine 24 hours to withdraw its troops from Donetsk. On the 23rd, he urged all residents of the city to evacuate, saying that artillery would be used. Throughout this time, attacks by both sides continued. These included a separatist attack on a Ukrainian convoy near Kramatorsk on 13 May which killed seven Ukrainian paratroopers and a disputed number of separatists, and mortar attacks on Ukrainian positions at Mount Karachun, near Sloviansk, on 19 and 20 May leaving one Ukrainian soldier dead and seven wounded.–û–¥–∏–Ω —É–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –±–æ–µ—Ü –ø–æ–≥–∏–±, –µ—â–µ —Ç—Ä–æ–µ —Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω—ã –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ –º–∏–Ω–æ–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∞ –ø–æ–¥ –°–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º.

According to Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, he personally gave the order for the Ukrainian flag to be raised over the town. Separatists and Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov both said that a portion of the rebels, including Girkin, military commander of the DPR, were retreating from Sloviansk. Avakov claimed that the separatists were \\"suffering losses and surrendering\\", and had lost one tank and four armoured vehicles in the retreat. Associated Press quoted Andrei Purgin, a spokesman for the separatists' self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, as saying the rebels were evacuating. A rebel commander said that they were falling back to Kramatorsk. Captured hostages claimed to have freed themselves from Sloviansk's main police station, and confirmed the rebel retreat. According to Girkin, 80-90 percent of his men had escaped from Sloviansk.

The politician, Volodymyr Ivanovych Rybak, from the Batkivshchyna party, was found near Sloviansk. Both men had the same cause of death: \\"combined injuries due to torture and death by drowning while unconscious.\\" Rybak was kidnapped by four pro-Russian militants in camouflage after he took part in a \\"For a United Ukraine\\" demonstration near the Horlivka city council building ‚Äì he was found in the river with a backpack filled with sand around his back and gutted. A statement by Ukraine's SBU state security service implicated Igor Bezler and Igor Strelkov ‚Äì whom it describes as senior officers in Russia's GRU military intelligence services which is leading the pro-Russian separatist movement in eastern Ukraine ‚Äì in the murder of Horlivka city council member Volodymyr Rybak. Rybak's wife, Elena, claimed at a news conference that checkpoints into the city of Horlivka were manned by Chechen militants, and they would not allow her to enter the city to identify his body. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) released a YouTube video implicating Bezler with an alleged audio recording. In it, he allegedly orders a subordinate to abduct Rybak, tie his hands and blindfold him, and then drive him to a remote place so that he could rendezvous with the captors. In the second part of the recording, Russian Military Intelligence Colonel Strelkov calls Ponomarev to take care of (Rybak's) body because it \\"is lying here and beginning to smell.\\" In response, Ponomarev complies, and says he will come to take the body and \\"organize the burial of this rooster.\\" =Abduction of Simon Ostrovsky= On 22 April, Simon Ostrovsky of Vice News was detained by pro- Russian separatists. \\"We had been looking into whether there were actual Russians involved in what's going on here ‚Äì for the two days prior to me being captured,\\" Ostrovsky said. \\"I had been phoning them and requesting interviews with them on that subject so maybe that's why they decided it was time to stop me.\\" Recounting the experience, he claimed, \\"They beat me up as an introduction to the whole situation, blindfolded me, tied my hands behind my back,\\" Ostrovsky said. \\"Then they eventually untied them and I was just hanging out in the room with the other prisoners.\\" Ostrovsky says his captors accused him of working for the CIA and FBI, and that during his stay \\"a dozen other nameless detainees were ferried in and out of the cellar of the Ukraine state security (SBU) building by the pro-Russia militants\\" and that many had been there for up to two weeks. When asked of his whereabouts during a press conference, self-appointed \\"people's mayor\\" Ponomarev said \\"nobody abducted him, nobody is holding him hostage, he's with us now in at the SBU, preparing material and working.\\" Stella Khoraeva, a spokeswoman for pro-Russian insurgents told the Associated Press that Ostrovsky was \\"fine\\" and \\"suspected of bad activities,\\" but refused to explain. She added that the pro-Russian group was conducting an investigation into Ostrovsky's activities. Khoraeva then said Ostrovsky was initially captured for spying on behalf of Ukrainian ultra-nationalists. Ponomarev reciprocated this claim, saying \\"According to our information, he is an informer of Right Sector.\\" Later, she said that the insurgents had planned to take Ostrovsky, which was prompted from his \\"incorrect way\\" of reporting. \\"We knew where he was going and the men manning the checkpoint were told to look out for him,\\" she said. Ponomarev has said his arrest was \\"so he wouldn't put out a lot of provocative commentary, so he wouldn't conduct hostile activity on our territory. In the final analysis, he is an undesirable element in our area.\\" When asked when he would be released, he said he would be released \\"when we consider it necessary for him to get out, then we'll let him out.\\" He also reiterated that he is not a hostage, but that they were 'defining his place of stay, so to speak.' The self-styled mayor then said that Ostrovsky could be released in a trade: \\"We need captives. We need a bargaining chip. Many of our comrades are imprisoned. Those guys [Ukrainians] are grabbing them, then taking them to Kiev and torturing them. So then, we're doing the very same thing. That is, in the sense that we're taking captives,\\" said Ponomarev. Jen Psaki, the US State Department spokeswoman, said US authorities are \\"deeply concerned\\" about the situation and are working to resolve it. \\"We condemn any such actions, and all recent hostage-takings in eastern Ukraine\\". On 24 April, Ostrovsky was released. =International military observers detained= On 25 April near Sloviansk, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry lost contact with military inspectors from OSCE participating states. The group, on an inspection mission under the Vienna Document on military transparency, was made up of three German soldiers, a German translator, and military observers from Czech Republic, Poland, Sweden and Denmark, a ministry spokesman said. \\"In Donetsk region communication has been lost with members of the OSCE military verification mission ... According to preliminary reports, they could be captured by terrorists,\\" the director of the ministry's information policy department, Yevhen Perebyinis, said at a briefing. The Interior Ministry later confirmed that 13 people (seven members from OSCE countries, five Ukrainian military representatives, and the driver) had been taken hostage by pro- Russian militants and held in the SBU building.. Mvs.gov.ua. Retrieved 4 May 2014 Ponomarev says he believes the detained military observers have a Kyiv \\"spy\\" in their group. \\"People who come here as observers for the European community bringing with them a real spy ‚Äì that is inappropriate,\\" Ponomarev told reporters. He also claimed the detention was due to the bus having \\"banned ammunition on board,\\" and he along with Russian media accused the observers of being \\"NATO officers.\\" The separatists have said they refuse to release the hostages until they meet with \\"competent authorities in Russia\\". Igor Strelkov, commander of the separatist militia, accused the monitors of being \\"NATO spies,\\" and that they would only be exchanged for pro-Russian \\"activists\\" held in custody in Kyiv. On 3 May, following the second offensive on Sloviansk, the observers along with five Ukrainian observers were released. The SBU then released what they described as a tapped phone call implicating Russia in the abduction, naming specifically Vladimir Lukin and Igor Girkin. =OSCE special monitoring mission observers= On 29 May Ponomarev admitted that he and his men were holding four OSCE observers, promising that they would be freed soon, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. He said they were detained for being \\"most-zealous.\\" The OSCE said it had lost contact with one of its four-person monitoring teams in Donetsk on Monday evening. His men had previously kidnapped OSCE monitors in eastern Ukraine. Notable figures * Alexander Mozhaev (\\"Babay\\" or \\"Bogeyman\\", ), a Russian military veteran from Belorechensk.

He is celebrated on August 23.http://www.boston-catholic-journal.com/roman- martrylogy-in-english/roman-martyrology-august-in-english.htm#August_23rd Lupus lived in Novae, a Roman fortress in the Danube valley, today the Bulgarian town Svishtov. He was contemporary with Roman Christian martyrs Montanus and Anastasia from Sirmium Life St. Lupus lived at the end of the 3rd century and beginning of the 4th century, and was a faithful servant of the holy Great Martyr Demetrius of Thessaloniki (October 26). Lupus was present at the death of his master, and he soaked his own clothing with his blood and took a ring from his hand. With these objects St Lupus worked many miracles at Thessaloniki. He attacked pagan idols, for which he was subjected to persecution by the pagans, but he was preserved unharmed by the power of God. St Lupus voluntarily delivered himself into the hands of the torturers, and by order of the Emperor Galerius, he was beheaded by the sword on August 23, shortly after St. Demetrius death (probably in 307). Novae The old legion fortress of Novae turned into a Roman-Byzantine town in the 5th ‚Äì 6th century . The ruins of the Bishop‚Äôs complex date back to those times. The ruins consist of a large basilica, residential houses with impressive baths, and a large building, which was designated for receiving the pilgrims to the local martyr St. Lupus. A baptistery impressive with its architecture was found west from the basilica entrance. It was an extension to the church in which Christianization was performed. Peter, the brother of the Emperor Mauricius (582-602) passed with his army through Novae at the end of the 6th century during his campaign in Dacian territories.

While searching for long-lost Mayan treasure using explosives, underwater explorers accidentally awaken a prehistoric predator that can travel on the land and in the sea. The film was released September 22, 2013. Plot On a small island off the coast of Belize, diver Jackson Slate is forced by local crime kingpin Tariq to dive for lost Mayan gold in the Great Blue Hole. Jackson, and two other divers detonate explosives at the bottom of the hole to find the gold, although the ensuing explosion knocks Jackson unconscious, and releases a prehistoric, Tyrannosaurus rex-type creature into the water, which kills the other two divers, as well as Tariq's guard on the surface. Meanwhile, couple Rod, and Jane are on vacation on the island, and are taken to the hole by boater Henry to go snorkeling. However, they come across Jackson floating in the water, and Henry takes him, as well as Rod, and Jane, to his marine biologist friend Sarah's house to nurse him back to health. However, they find a gold coin that Jackson kept for later, and question him about it. Jackson reveals his trouble with Tariq, although invites the group to diving with him to find the rest of the gold. All go except Jane, who decides not to get caught up in the potential trouble Jackson is in, and she stays on the island. Two of Tariq's men are sent to search for Jackson's team, although are killed by the same reptilian creature. Jackson's group, as well as the local coast guard find the wreckage, as well as a severed arm, which Sarah concludes was bitten off by a giant creature. Nevertheless, Jackson, and Sarah go diving for the gold while Rod, and Henry remain at the surface, and find a series of eggs belonging to the creature, deciding to take one to Sarah's lab to study. Meanwhile, Jane is invited by two tourists to join her on a boat party. However, the boat is attacked by the creature; Jane is knocked off the boat, and drowns while everybody else is killed by the creature. Rod, and Henry rush to save her, although are too late, and she dies, devastating Rod. At the lab, the egg hatches, birthing a smaller, similar reptilian creature, which attacks Jackson, and Sarah, causing them to lock it in a refrigerator. Tariq, and his men soon arrive to confront Jackson, although he releases the baby creature on them, seemingly killing them as Jackson, and Sarah escape, and reunite with Rod, and Henry. Now aware there is a deadly creature in the water, the group heads out onto the sea with the coast guard to try to kill the creature. However, their attempts fail, and Henry is killed. The remaining group returns to shore, and the coast guard heads out to destroy the creature once more, although it quickly kills them before attacking, and killing people on land. Jackson, Sarah, and Rod attempt to steal a car, although Tariq arrives still demanding Jackson for the gold. The creature eats Tariq, allowing Jackson, Sarah, and Rod to escape. After picking up guns at Tariq's compound, they are chased into the forest by the creature before escaping to an abandoned military base, where they decide to spend the night. They attempt to radio for help, although to no avail. Jackson, and Sarah have sex that night before the group gets a response from the military the next morning, which states they're going to bomb the island in order to kill the creature, and they have to escape. Jackson decides to fly a plane over the ocean to distract the creature while Sarah, and Rod escape in a boat. However, the creature chases the boat instead, and Rod attempts to shoot it with a bazooka, although falls into the water, and is eaten.

Early life  T.N. Angami was born the son of V N Angami in Jotsoma village near Kohima in a wealthy Angami Naga family in 1913. He was schooled in Kohima, Jorhat and Shillong. He served as a Store Keeper in the Indian Army during the Second World War. From 1946, he worked in the office of the Deputy Commissioner of the Naga Hills District for five years.  Political career  Angami began his political life in 1951 when he resigned from his job as an office assistant to join the Naga National Council, an organisation that he went on to head as its president. Later, as the Council under Angami Zapu Phizo took to armed rebellion against the Government of India, Angami opposed Phizo and, in 1957, formed the Reforming Committee of the Naga National Council with the aims of opposing violence, winning over the rebels and restoring peace in Nagaland. In August 1957, the Reforming Committee convened an All Tribes Conference in Kohima that called for the constitution of the Naga Hills District and the Tuensang Division of the North East Frontier Agency into a single administrative division within the Union of India. The state of Nagaland was established in 1963 and P. Shilu Ao of the Naga Nationalist Organisation became its first Chief Minister. Following elections to the Nagaland Legislative Assembly in 1964, Angami was elected its first Speaker. Following a no confidence motion against the government, Ao resigned as Chief Minister and was succeeded by Angami who served from August, 1966 to February, 1969. As Chief Minister, he convened a Peace Mission and convinced the Government of India to take a more liberal view of the rebels and to grant them amnesty without preconditions. His efforts resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the Government of India and the Naga rebels. In the elections of 1969, the Naga Nationalist Organisation was voted back to power but Angami stepped down as Chief Minister and was succeeded by Hokishe Sema. Later, Angami shifted to the United Democratic Front and then joined the Congress(I).

She also served as the city mayor from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2013. Prior to her mayoral term, she has also served as vice mayor of Davao City from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2010. She is the daughter of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. Early life and education Sara Duterte was born in Davao City on May 31, 1978, the second child to lawyer Rodrigo Duterte and flight attendant Elizabeth Zimmerman. Since her youth, Duterte had a fierce and independent character, leading to a \\"love-hate relationship\\" with her father when she was a student due to her disapproval for his womanizing tendencies and late night activities. Despite this, Rodrigo considered Sara to be his favorite child, and placed high value on the education she and her brothers received. Sara Duterte attended San Pedro College, majoring in BS Respiratory Therapy, and graduated in 1999; in her inaugural speech as Mayor of Davao City, Duterte said she originally wanted to be a pediatrician instead of a politician. She later took up a law degree at the San Sebastian College ‚Äì Recoletos and graduated in May 2005. In 2006, Duterte passed the Philippine Bar Examination. She is a reserved full-fledged colonel in the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Political career Duterte being interviewed by the ABS-CBN News Crew on March 12, 2009 when she was still Vice Mayor. =City Mayor of Davao= Duterte-Carpio is Davao City's first woman mayor and the youngest to have been elected to the position in the political history of Davao City after she switched roles with her father Rodrigo Duterte from 2010-2013 as mayor and vice-mayor, respectively. Vowing to be ‚Äúuseful and to serve the country at all times,‚Äù Duterte, the vice-mayor in the three years prior, assumed the post that her father Rodrigo held for over 20 years. Sara won over House Speaker Prospero Nograles, her father's political rival, in a lead of 200,000 votes in the 2010 elections. Nograles earlier filed a protest at the Commission on Elections in Manila questioning the results, stating that there was a conspiracy of local poll officials. Duterte was also one of the nine elected governors of the Philippine Red Cross in 2014. In October 2015, she shaved her head to convince her father to run for President in the 2016 Philippine presidential elections, despite the latter's reticence due to lack of campaign funds and political machinery. She ran again for the mayoralty post for Davao City in the 2016 elections and won the position succeeding her father, now the current president, for the second time. Future plans and support for her father's administration Two years into his term, Sara Duterte's father, President Rodrigo Duterte, announced that he wants his daughter to succeed him. The Dutertes are known to support political dynasties in the Philippines, when they aggressively gathered support against the Anti-Political Dynasty Bill during 2015, stating that their nearly four decades of uncontested rule in Davao as a product of \\"democratic\\" process. They also accused and blame various politicians of being political dynasties. About two months after her father's proclamation of Sara Duterte as his \\"successor\\", Sara Duterte launched a movement that gathers support from Duterte's political allies, supporters, and friends and called it \\"Tapang at Malasakit\\" (). Sara Duterte denies that it has anything to do with any campaign or position, but pundits state that it was part of her plans to gain political traction for future campaigns and an attempt to rally political allies against Senator Antonio Trillanes' \\"Tindig Pilipinas\\" (Be Upright, Philippines), a movement which actively pushes for an investigation into Duterte's alleged corruption, hidden wealth, and involvement in extrajudicial killings and a stop to all of Duterte's lies. Such movement did not gain any traction since it was established. On October 18, 2018, after having alternated for two decades in the mayor's and vice-mayor office of Davao with her father (now the country's president) and her brother Paolo (former vice- mayor), she resubmitted her candidacy to the mayor's office of Davao and backs in his candidacy to vice-mayor to her younger brother Sebastian (without any previous political experience). Appears with them her older brother Paolo (who had resigned as Davao's vice-mayor in December 2017), and who now returns to political life by presenting his candidacy to Congress. Paolo's wife (January Duterte, who is the incumbent Barangay Captain in one of the districts of the city) is also running in the municipal elections. She said in interview that she does not intend to withdraw her COC as city mayor and request for a substitution to run for a national post, similar to what President Rodrigo Duterte did before in the 2016 presidential elections. However, many political commentators are talking about her preparations to run for the Senate and even see her as the future president of the Philippines. Personal life Duterte has been married since October 27, 2007 to her fellow lawyer Manases \\"Mans\\" R. Carpio, whom she met while she was attending San Beda University. They have two children: an adopted daughter, Mikhaila Mar√≠a, nicknamed \\"Sharky\\", and a son, Mateo Lucas, nicknamed \\"Stingray\\". Manases, a nephew of Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio,Manases Carpio's father, Lucas (Davao City Regional Trial Court), is the brother of Conchita. is a legal counsel for Lapanday Foods Corp.Sara Duterte slams NPA: You think the world is all about youPhilippine Peasants were Promised Land. Staking a Claim can be Deadly On April 18, 2016, in connection with the rape remark made by her father Rodrigo on one of his presidential candidacy campaigns, Duterte took to her Instagram account to admit that she was once a rape victim. However, Rodrigo Duterte dismissed his daughter's admission and referred to her as a \\"drama queen\\". In August 2018, her father remarked about the high statistics of rape cases in Davao, joking that there are \\"many beautiful women\\" in Davao, which explains the high rate. Sara responded by defending her father, asking the critics what good they have done for Davao, compared to her family's governance.

A private school was therefore established at Ako Adjei Area. At independence, the first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, realized that to achieve his ideals with respect to the rapid development of the country, educational facilities should be widespread and brought to the doorstep of each Ghanaian child. The Ghana Educational Trust was therefore instituted during the 1st republic and was charged with the construction of school buildings throughout the country, including Labone. The school was then relocated at the present site (opposite the Labone S.D.A Church).And well famous school in Ghana.By Ameyaw Solomon Chancellor  The crest of Labone senior high school - composition, meaning and symbolism  The crest was designed by Nii Amon Kotei a senior citizen and national award winner who also designed the Ghana coat of arms.

Spain was an important center of knowledge during the medieval era. While most of western and southern Europe suffered from the collapse of the Roman Empire, although declining, some regions of the former empire, Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula), southern Italy, and the remainder of the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire, did not to suffer from the full impact of the so-called Dark Ages when education collapsed with the collapse of the empire and most knowledge was lost. The Islamic conquests of places such as Egypt, which was a major part of the Byzantine Empire, and other places which were centers of knowledge in earlier times, gave the Muslims access to knowledge from many cultures which they translated into Arabic and recorded in books for the use of their own educated elites, who flourished in this period, and took with them to the Hispania after it fell under Muslim control. Much of this knowledge was later translated by Christian and Jewish scholars in the Christian kingdoms of the Reconquista from Arabic into Latin, and from there it spread through Europe.  Inventions and discoveries from the Golden Age of Al Andalus  Note: Although these inventions were created on the Iberian Peninsula, that does not mean they were not made by people of Spanish heritage due to the area being part of the Islamic Empire. * Alcohol distillation * Animal Testing, first recorded use of animals for medical testing was done by Ibn Zuhr, known as Avenzoar, (1094‚Äì1161). * Antiseptics were in used as early as the 10th century in hospitals in Islamic Spain. Special protocols, in Al Andalus, were used to keep hygiene before and after surgery. * Botany, Spanish botanist, like Ibn al-Baitar, created hundreds of works/catalogs on the various plants in not only Europe but the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In these works many processes for extracting essential oils, drugs as well as their uses can be found. * Brass type movable printer press/first printing device in Europe, first invented in Muslim Spain 100 years prior to the invention of printing press, by Johannes Gutenburg of Germany, in 1454. * Inheritance of traits first proposed by Abu Al-Zahrawi (936‚Äì1013 AD) more than 800 years before Austrian monk, Mendel. Al-Zahrawi was first to record and suggest that hemophilia was an inherited disease. * Inhalation anesthesia, invented by al- Zahrawi and Ibn Zuhr. Used a sponge soaked with narcotic drugs and placed it on patients face. * Ligatures, described in the work of al-Zarawi (936‚Äì1013 AD), Kitab al-Tasrif, one of the most influential books in early modern medicine.

Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (936‚Äì1013 AD), better known in the west as Albucasis, is regarded as the father of modern surgery and is the most quoted surgeon of all times. Albucasis invented over 200 tools for use in surgery - many still in use today. * Pathology - various Muslim physicians in Spain were crucial in the development of modern medicine. Pathology, obviously was an important development in medicine. The first correct proposal of the nature of disease was described by al-Zahrawi and Ibn Zuhr. * Pharmacopoeia (book of medicine). During the 14th century, the physician from Malaga, Ibn Baytar, wrote a pharmacopoeia naming over 1400 different drugs and their uses in medicine. This book was written 200 years before the supposed first pharmacopoeia was written by German scholar in 1542. * Speed of sound, was proposed by the Cordoba scholar Ibn Hazm (994‚Äì1064 AD). Ibn Hazm argued and calculated the speed of sound by echoes in the Mosque of Cordoba. He is also credited as being the first to propose that thunder was a production of lightning. * Spherical Earth Theory by Ibn Hazm (994‚Äì1064 AD). * Water and weight driven mechanical clocks, by Spanish Muslim engineers sometime between 900‚Äì1200 AD. According to historian Will Durant, a watch like device was invented by Ibn Firnas.  Architecture and construction  * Artificio de Juanelo by engineer Juanelo Turriano (1500‚Äì1585) in the 16th century, designed to supply the city with a source of readily available water by lifting it. At the time they were considered engineering wonders.

She was educated at the Sorbonne and Oxford. Together with her lawyer husband she worked for female suffrage from 1908 and during the First World War, and was willing to suffer arrest and incarceration for her beliefs. She travelled widely, giving lectures. She and her husband were also leading members of the Cyclists' Touring Club. After the war she was elected to the London County Council, where she campaigned for equal pay for men and women, better public housing, and the provision of nursery education. She later led the building of an archive of the suffrage campaign. Life and career Yates was born in Dalyell Road, Lambeth, London, to a language teacher, Elph√®ge Janau (b. 1847), and his wife, Marie Pauline (1841‚Äì1909), both French-born and naturalised British citizens. She was the youngest of their three children. She was educated at high schools in Clapham and Truro, and later at Kassel and the Sorbonne, Paris,Crawford, pp. 763‚Äì764 and then, from 1896, at Royal Holloway College where she studied modern languages and philology.

She joined the recently founded Wimbledon branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908. Her political activism had the full support of her husband, who became a member of the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement and also defended her at her 1909 trial, and acted for other WPSU prisoners, most notably Emily Davison's family at her inquest.

She was arrested, along with 28 other demonstrators, charged with obstruction and although defended by her husband Tom, she spoke about having the 'courage of her convictions' and said she agreed to \\"bear whatever punishment you may think me deserving of', and was sentenced to a month's imprisonment.\\"Woman Suffrage: The Disturbance at Westminster\\", The Times, 26 February 1909, p. 7 Her son was eight months old at the time, and she had to leave him with her husband. She justified this by considering how she would feel if he asked later, what she had done for the women's cause, if she had done nothing. Punch printed a set of verses criticising her for abandoning him.\\"A Mother's Sacrifice\\", Punch, 10 March 1909, p. 172 When she returned home she found her house was decorated in the colours of green, white, violet. In 1910 Yates became honorary secretary of the Wimbledon WSPU; under her leadership it became one of the most flourishing branches of the organisation. Among those who came to address the branch were Mary Gawthorpe, George Lansbury and an old college friend, Emily Davison, although her invitation to Constance Lytton in April 2011 was declined because of Lytton's poor health. Yates herself also travelled widely, giving lectures. Hunger striking Suffragettes resting in the garden of her house Dorset Hall c.1912 L to R: Edith Marian Begbie, three year old Paul (Roses's son), Gertrude Wilkinson and Florence Macfarlane She and her husband made their house in Merton a refuge where activists released from prison could recuperate. In 1911 Thomas Lamartine Yates was arrested during a demonstration against the government for blocking a bill to allow limited female suffrage. He was not charged, but the publicity damaged his law firm for a time. He made himself available as legal adviser to WSPU prisoners, and in June 1913 he represented the Davison family at the inquest into Emily Davison's death after throwing herself under the king's horse at the Derby. Together with Mary Leigh, Rose was at the dying Davison's bedside, and headed a guard of honour for the funeral procession.Crawford, pp. 340 and 764 Rose carefully kept some of Emily's last possessions for many years, and was sent a letter of thanks from Davison's mother, Margaret, for her 'kind sympathy and appreciation of (her) dear daughter's sacrifice. It was not made in vain. That I feel and take great comfort in the thought.'. She also mentions sharing with neighbours, Tom's touching letter about Emily, which was published in the Daily Sketch. At the beginning of the First World War the Wimbledon WSPU converted its meeting room and shop into a soup kitchen and opened another in nearby Merton. The war precipitated a split between Yates and the leading suffragette, Emmeline Pankhurst. Under the latter's leadership the WSPU suspended its militant campaign for female suffrage, instead backing the government in the fight against Germany. Yates and others disagreed with this policy. In 1914, together with Alice Green, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Lady Constance Lytton, Ada Wright, raised the fare for Kitty Marion to emigrate to the United States, to avoid the anti-German sentiment rising in the United Kingdom. Yates joined others who broke away to form a new body, the Suffragettes of the WSPU including Mary Leigh. This organisation intended to be militant and national but never achieved a large impact, and like the Independent WSPU it was created in 1916. The SWSPU passed a resolution to concentrate on women's suffrage and to not encourage debate about former WSPU leaders. In the general election of 1918, in which for the first time, limited female suffrage was granted, Yates was adopted as Labour candidate for the Wimbledon constituency, but both she and the Liberal candidate withdrew shortly before polling.\\"Last Candidates\\", The Times, 4 December 1918, p. 10 The following year she was elected to the London County Council, representing North Lambeth, and its only independent member. Seven other women candidates stood successfully in the same election.\\"L.C.C.

The building was bombed during the Second World War, but some of its records were saved and are now (2015) in the Suffragette Fellowship collection in the Museum of London. Yates died at her London home at the age of 79. Her 18th century house, Dorset Hall, was left to the local council and it is now converted to flats.

Moon has been wearing the sensor permanently since March 2013 and has used her seismic sense to create dance pieces. Waiting for Earthquakes is a solo dance performance where the dancer stands still until an earthquake is felt. The choreography depends on the earthquakes felt during the duration of the performance and the intensity of the dancer's movements depend on the magnitude of each earthquake (which can be felt from 1.0 in the Richter Scale). If there are no earthquakes during the time of performance the dancer will not dance.Davis, Sally. \\"Encounters with the Posthuman\\", Nautilus, 29 April 2013.

Armani was attested in the treaties of Sargon in a section that mentions regions located in Assyria and Babylonia or territories adjacent to the east, in contrast to the Syrian Ebla, located in the west. The later King Adad- Nirari I of Assyria also mentions Armani as being located east of the Tigris and on the border between Assyria and Babylon.

Life and career Alf Rattigan was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia on 16 November 1911. In 1925 he joined the Royal Australian Navy as a 13-year-old cadet Midshipman at Jervis Bay. Between July 1960 and May 1963 he was Comptroller General of Customs and Permanent Head of the Department of Customs and Excise. Alf Rattigan was appointed to chair the Tariff Board in 1963, and was subsequently the first chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission when it replaced the Tariff Board in 1974. His book Industry Assistance:The Inside Story, published in 1986, provided an account of the struggle against protectionism in Australia during the 1960s and early 1970s. It described the extent of entrenched opposition, by private interest groups and within government and bureaucracy, to policy transparency and to economic reform. His commitment to reform was not the product of economic rectitude. He believed that rational‚Äîthat is, nationally rewarding‚Äîeconomic policies are the means by which we can produce the additional wealth needed to achieve our social goals. He reasoned that the national wealth available to service those goals sets the limit on our ability to provide better education and improved health care, and argued that any compromise on economic reform lowers that limit. The Tariff Board, which preceded the Industries Assistance Commission, was established as an independent statutory body, charged with recommending assistance to ‚Äòeconomic and efficient‚Äô industries. It was required to hold public hearings on the matters referred to it by governments and to provide its advice to governments in public reports. Until the mid-sixties its recommendations reflected the established ‚Äòneeds-based‚Äô approach‚Äîthat is, the level of protection needed to enable each industry to compete against international competition. Although its statute required it to report on ‚Äòthe operation of the Tariff and the development of industries‚Äô, its annual reports offered little insight into the economic consequences of the protection it recommended, and were generally limited to a description of those recommendations. In the mid-sixties, following a wide-ranging review of economic policy commissioned by the then Australian government, the Board began to consider how the Board should respond to the quite limited policy guidance provided in its statute. Rattigan was aware of the adverse economic consequences of the established ‚Äòneeds-based‚Äô approach to protection. In 1967 he outlined a new approach, developed to ensure that the Board's recommendations were consistent with the settled goals of national economic policy. This included a systematic public review of the structure and levels of protection, focusing on industries with high levels of protection, rather than the past focus on particular industries or products. It nominated levels of protection that indicated low, medium and high cost production (using ‚Äòeffective rate‚Äô, a measure of the protection accorded a process or industry rather than their outputs, developed by Professor Max Corden). The Board foreshadowed its intention to use the effective rate concept (measuring the net protection accorded an industry as a result of the opposite effects of protection on its inputs and outputs) in deciding which industries were highly protected and thus most in need of review. It also identified improvements needed in the policy information system supporting its work. Rattigan introduced these improvements, important in reporting on the economy-wide effects of protection, in the early life of the Industries Assistance Commission. These changes were in stark contrast to the established approach to protection, an approach to which both the Department of Trade and its Minister were strongly committed. The tension that developed between the Minister and Rattigan, and within Cabinet between Trade Ministers on the one hand and Treasurers on the other, stimulated intense public interest and discussion about the roles of advice and decision-making on protection. The Minister and department regarded the changes proposed by Rattigan as a matter of policy, beyond the authority of the advisory body. Rattigan saw it as exercising his statutory responsibility for making transparent the criteria used in formulating recommendations. The resulting tension was inevitable, and became very public. Rattigan was at one point warned by the Minister against providing a public explanation of the proposed changes on the grounds that he would be in breach of his authority in expressing a view that may not be consistent with government policy. In a policy environment catering for special interest groups, the Commission's charter and procedures were designed to reflect the logic underlying market economics and democracy. The logic behind market economics assumes the existence of well-informed consumers, and the logic behind democracy assumes a well-informed community. That was the rationale for establishing the Commission, structured to operate outside government and independent of private interest groups. Rattigan's contribution to public policy was not limited to protection reform. As Professor Max Corden has pointed out, the Industries assistance Commission under Alf Rattigan sponsored the introduction of general equilibrium modelling in Australia. Early in the life of the Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics completed the integration of official data systems. This meant that it was possible to relate data on the structure of the economy to other official data collected. Rattigan sponsored the development, under Professor Alan Powel's leadership, of an analytical framework that equipped the Commission to assess the economy-wide effects of changes in protection. The resulting framework, or its offshoots, is now used routinely by federal and state governments as an aid in understanding the likely consequences of other policy changes under consideration. This has introduced greater discipline and public accountability into policy decision-making. Rattigan did not use his access to the corridors of power to secure preferment or directorships, of which he had none. His enduring legacy is that the wealth Australians now enjoy is, in no small part, the result of his struggle against protectionism. Rattigan died in Canberra on 29 February 2000 after a battle with prostate cancer. Awards and honours Rattigan was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in January 1960 when he was a Deputy Secretary at the Department of Trade. In January 1964, while Chairman of the Tariff Board, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In January 1992 Rattigan was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his contributions to public service. In 2012, a street in the Canberra suburb of Casey was named Rattigan Street in Alf Rattigan's honour.

A school-going son, a daughter still in cradle and Madevappa's aged mother are the others in the family. It is a hand-to-mouth existence; but they have got used to it, with their own small pleasures and distant dreams. The whole village is getting geared up for the Chief Minister (CM)'s visit on 1 December. CM's officially scheduled overnight stay in Madevappa's house naturally gives Madevappa & family extra attention from all quarters giving them the feeling of a higher status and a brighter future. They look forward to the event with all the zeal and enthusiasm. CM's visit goes on well with a grand welcome, dinner with Madevappa, Photo Shoots, Press Meets, discussions with local leaders etc. Madevappa & family are overwhelmed by the proceedings, but hardly get to interact with the CM. Instead, they face embarrassing moments feeling as though they are outsiders in their own house.

The organisation was founded by transgender activist and artist Kalki Subramaniam in July 2008 to provide opportunities for education, counseling services, education scholarships and supporting livelihood through creative skills training and development. The organisation is based in Tamil Nadu state in India. The organisation uses art, literature, films and theatre to advocate for social, economic, and political justice for transgender people and gender- nonconforming people. Origin During her postgraduate studies, Kalki started publishing a monthly magazine in Tamil for transgender women called Sahodari. At that time prejudice against the transgender people was high because media projected only stereotyped images of transgender people. She wanted to break it and bring forth the real issues and problems of the transgender community. In her magazine, she wrote on health, wellness, spirituality, employment and education. Mission The Foundation's main objective is to promote social, political, and economic equity and campaign for civil and legal rights of transgender people. Awards In 2010, Sahodari Foundation received the Kokilavani Memorial Award for its contribution towards transgender rights and activism. The foundation trained transgender people as community video journalists and encouraged them to speak up their stories on visual media through a project called ‚ÄòProject Kalki‚Äô. Many transgender women brought out their voices through video films and the organisation showcased those films in Youtube, blogs and other websites and also screened the films across the country. For this innovative effort, the organisation received an international award for innovation in activism using technology and internet.

Background The hang clean is not typically a competitive lift, but is often used in preparation for certain Olympic lifts such as the clean and jerk. It uses a series of quick movements to create momentum that allows weightlifters to lift more than with traditional isolation exercises. It requires the use of a weight bar and compatible weights. Many experts view this lift as potentially dangerous for inexperienced weightlifters and recommend using lower weights and obtaining proper supervision. When performed correctly, this compound exercise works several different muscle groups, including the quadriceps, back, shoulders, and arms, and can improve coordination. Movement =Starting position: Hanging= The first position when performing the hang clean is to assume the hang, or hinge, position. Rather than placing the barbell on the ground, the weightlifter starts with feet hip-width apart, bent at the hips with the barbell hanging just above the knees held in an overhand grip, close to the legs with the chest over the bar. The knees should be slightly bent and not locked. The weightlifter should maintain a flat back and keep the head up. =Second position: Extending= From the starting position, the weightlifter then should begin the movement by powerfully extending through the hips, knees, and ankles to create an upward momentum. At the same time, the weightlifter should shrug the shoulders toward the ears. As this motion starts to bring the barbell upward, the weightlifter flexes the arms to bend the elbows upward and outward. This creates a vertical trajectory. The weightlifter should focus on keeping most of the weight on the heels to manage this force while pushing the shoulders back. Some people even recommend performing a slight jump for added momentum. =Third position: Catching= As the bar is propelled upwards, the weightlifter shifts his or her body under the bar to catch the weight using his or her chest. The palms end up facing the ceiling and the weightlifter sinks into a squat position while catching the weight. This is also known as racking the weight. The end of the movement is when the weightlifter stands fully upright, then bends the knees slightly to lower the weight back into the starting position. Variants There are a few variations and alternative exercises to the hang clean, including the clean and the power clean. Many athletes use this exercise to prepare for the clean and jerk, which is a competitive weightlifting exercise seen in the Olympics.

It serves as means to monitor, steer, observe and optimize software development, software maintenance, and software re- engineering in the sense of a business intelligence approach specific to software systems. It is generally based on the automatic extraction, analysis, and visualization of corresponding information sources of the software system. It can also be manually done and not automatic.  Applications  Software diagnosis supports all branches of software engineering, in particular project management, quality management, risk management as well as implementation and test. Its main strength is to support all stakeholders of software projects (in particular during software maintenance and for software re-engineering tasks) and to provide effective communication means for software development projects. For example, software diagnosis facilitates \\"bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument\\". Software diagnosis includes assessment methods for \\"perfective maintenance\\" that, for example, apply \\"visual analysis techniques to combine multiple indicators for low maintainability, including code complexity and entanglement with other parts of the system, and recent changes applied to the code\\".  Characteristics  In contrast to manifold approaches and techniques in software engineering, software diagnosis does not depend on programming languages, modeling techniques, software development processes or the specific techniques used in the various stages of the software development process. Instead, software diagnosis aims at analyzing and evaluating the software system in its as-is state and based on system-generated information to bybass any subjective or potentially outdated information sources (e.g., initial software models). For it, software diagnosis combines and relates sources of information that are typically not directly linked. Examples: * Source-code metrics are related with software developer activity to gain insight into developer-specific effects on software code quality. * System structure and run-time execution traces are correlated to facilitate program comprehension through dynamic analysis in software maintenance tasks.  Principles  The core principle of software diagnosis is to automatically extract information from all available information sources of a given software projects such as source code base, project repository, code metrics, execution traces, test results, etc. To combine information, software-specific data mining, analysis, and visualization techniques are applied. Its strength results, among various reasons, from integrating decoupled information spaces in the scope of a typical software project, for example development and developer activities (recorded by the repository) and code and quality metrics (derived by analyzing source code) or key performance indicators (KPIs).  Examples  Examples of software diagnosis tools include software maps and software metrics.  Critics  Software diagnosis‚Äîin contrast to many approaches in software engineering‚Äîdoes not assume that developer capabilities, development methods, programming or modeling languages are right or wrong (or better or worse compared to each other): Software diagnosis aims at giving insight into a given software system and its status regardless of the methods, languages, or models used to create and maintain the system. =Related subjects= *Cost estimation in software engineering *Programming productivity *Rapid application development *Software design *Software development *Software documentation *Software map *Software release life cycle *Systems design *Systems Development Life Cycle References External links * A tool set based on software maps by Software Diagnostics, 2014 * Demo video interactive software maps for source-code analysis, 2013 Software maintenance Software engineering Software metrics Software development process Software development Software quality Quality ","title":"Software diagnosis"},{"id":"42505496","text":"Sukhbir Singh Jaunapuria is an Indian politician and owner of a Gurugram-based real estate group.

He is a retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of 1976 batch and former Director General of Police (DGP). He served as DGP of Rajasthan from March 2009 to December 2013 which is recorded to be IUI the longest tenure of a DGP in Rajasthan. He has also been awarded the 1996 Indian Police Medal and 2002 President Medal. Harish Chandra's Meena's main focus for constituency development is education. More than 70% of his local area development fund is spent on education. His key efforts include establishing 2 central schools, setting up India's only Rural Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra and launching his own flagship program for girl child development.  Early life  Harish Chandra Meena was born on 5 September 1954 in Bamanwas, Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan to Shri. Narayan Meena and Smt. Narayani Devi. He completed Bachelors of Political Science Honors in Rajasthan University. He went to Jawaharlal Nehru University (New Delhi) for his Masters in Political Science. During his final year of Masters he got through Indian Police Service.

Initiatives and Reforms  Harish Meena reformed the recruitment process of Police Constables in Rajasthan by making it more objective and transparent. In a bid to minimize corruption and biases, he completely removed written tests involving subjective answers, observation based physical examinations and personal interviews. Consequentially, Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) based written tests and objective physical examinations were introduced. The latter required each candidate to run 10 km in 60 minutes to qualify. To completely eradicate the scope of manipulation, a GPS chip was attached on the leg of the candidate. There was widespread criticism and skepticism towards this change. However to demonstrate the feasibility of the new physical tests, Mr. Meena himself started running in all recruitment centers. He completed the 10 km run within 48 minutes in Kota, 12 minutes ahead of the qualifying time. This recruitment pattern was also emulated by various states, Para Military and Armed Forces. As a break from the convention, police recruitment process during Harish Meena's tenure as DGP was never challenged in court. Harish Meena also focused on improving the track record of Rajasthan police in matters pertaining to human rights. He passed a standing order that stated that the whole police station would be liable to face a punishment posting if there was any death in the custody including suicide. A new post for Addl. Director General was created to overlook a cell that specially monitored crimes against the vulnerable sections of the society which included schedule tribes, schedule castes, women and children.

Elizabeth is not pleased with the purchase but says she wants Philip to be happy. Philip stands firm and presses Elizabeth about her enjoyment of American life, but she responds that she is here to do a job and life in America is easier, but not better. Martha implies that she no longer wants to spy on her coworkers. Philip plans to play a doctored recording of her coworkers making fun of her looks. But his surprise appearance at her apartment is enough to change her mind without using the recording. Lucia ambushes Larrick at his house with a tranquilizer gun, but her plan backfires when Larrick overpowers her and shoots her with her own tranquilizer. He calls Elizabeth over, revealing a tied-up Lucia. They negotiate Lucia's life for Larrick's release from the KGB's control. However, when Larrick unties Lucia, she attacks him with a corkscrew but is stopped by Larrick. As Lucia is slowly being strangled to death, Elizabeth points her gun at Larrick, who reminds her about the mission. Forced to choose between saving Lucia or saving the mission, she chooses the mission and lets Lucia die. She later expresses frustration to Philip that Lucia did not understand her role. Philip meets with their handler Kate. She instructs him to steal information on America‚Äôs stealth program. She also informs him that the propeller plan he had stolen earlier is faulty, causing a Soviet submarine to sink and all 160 men aboard to die. Philip and Elizabeth are distraught to learn the news. Henry is caught breaking in by the neighbors when he falls asleep on the sofa after playing a video game. The neighbors bring him back to Philip and Elizabeth without calling the police. When Philip and Elizabeth later talk to Henry, he breaks down admitting to his mistake and saying that he is a good person who 'knows the difference between right and wrong'. Stan gives Oleg the FBI surveillance log on him and fails to get Oleg to guarantee Nina‚Äôs safety. Nina later confronts Stan about Oleg wanting more, realizing that she has successfully turned Stan when he promises to keep her safe no matter what. Stan is frustrated when the FBI and DoJ refuse to grant him access to Anton‚Äôs research. He later meets with a DoD official trying to gain clearance. Arkady is concerned about his nephew in the navy due to the submarine sinking and is upset that the KGB has failed the country. Oleg surmises that the navy is also at fault for placing the propeller on a larger submarine and not testing it adequately. Philip and Elizabeth kidnap a driver who services the septic system of Martial Eagle base and questions him about his routine. The man is hesitant and extremely fearful. Though Elizabeth is direct and impatient, Philip eventually coaxes the man into answering, telling him everything will be okay. When Elizabeth starts to pull out a gun to kill the man to prevent being traced, Philip stops her, stating they can tie him up instead.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate), but in 1727 it was transferred to Moscow Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Rameshki was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed to Tver Governorate. It belonged to Bezhetsky Uyezd. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Rameshkovsky District, with the administrative center in Rameshki, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast.

In 1629, Alexander gave ¬£10,000(Scots) to the Provost and Bailles of Aberdeen for the maintenance of bursars at the Grammar School and at Marischal College, Aberdeen. During the early seventeenth century, the Irvings of Drum were supporters of Charles I. The family and the estate and castle were attacked by Covenanters. See Clan Irvine Drum Castle is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland. in 1633 was supplemented by a number of other benefactors.

In 1721, maiden daughters of Burgesses of Guild were also admitted. This house was demolished in 1798. The City of Aberdeen has a plaque adjacent to the spot where the ‚Äúhospital‚Äù was located on Upper Kirkgate. The Present The Aberdeen City Council has decided to wind up a number of these charities that have insufficient funds to operate efficiently. An interesting example relates to the house or hospital founded by Lady Drum in 1633. After discussions with OSCR the residual funds from the Lady Drum Hospital have been allocated to another local charity, the Instant Neighbour scheme.See Aberdeen Council Paper C/G/13/087 ‚Äì 21st August 2013. The Instant Neighbour Scheme (SC0022223) aims to: \\"‚Ä¶ to prevent or relieve poverty, ‚Ä¶the advancement of health the advancement of environmental protection or improvement ..(and) ..,any other purpose that may reasonably be regarded as analogous to any of the preceding purposes‚Ä¶..\\" OSCR have decided that historic charities should be amalgamated to maximize potential income to beneficiaries. OSCR's functions in Scotland, amongst others are to: Keep a public Register of charities; Encourage, facilitate and monitor compliance by charities with the provisions of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005. In general, the future of many ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù charities or trusts is in doubt. Many Pre- reformation hospital charities or trusts have been wound up in recent years due to the absence of beneficiaries and diminishing income from mortification and the old ‚ÄúFeu‚Äù system. Feuing was in practice abolished in Scotland in 2000. An example was the Bishop Gavin Dunbar's Hospital, SC003765 which no longer operates.

Formed in 1979, the band released two albums on Warner Bros. Records: Couchois in 1979, and Nasty Hardware in 1980. History The Couchois brothers began playing in bands together while in junior high school during the 1960s. In 1971, Chris and Pat joined Ratchell with bassist Howard Messer and former Steppenwolf guitarist Larry Byrom. The group released two albums for Decca Records before splitting up. A few years later, Mike Couchois joined his brothers and Messer and Chas Carlson to form the group Couchois. The band signed with Warner Bros. Records and released their self-titled debut album, which peaked at #170 on the Billboard 200 in 1979. The album featured a guest appearance by Chuck Findley. A review of the album in a 1979 issue of Billboard called Couchois a \\"solid debut LP\\" with a \\"very melodic rock sound\\" and \\"noteworthy\\" keyboard work. Pete Bishop of Pittsburgh Press said it was an \\"enjoyable and promising debut album\\" and compared the band's style to that of Creedence Clearwater Revival and Orleans. In 1980, Couchois released their second album, Nasty Hardware, which included their song \\"Roll The Dice\\", which was later covered by such bands as Rage and Charlie. Rolling Stone gave the album a one-star rating and characterized Couchois as an \\"aggravatingly lame soft-rock quintet that sports three brothers and zero talent.\\" After the band dissolved, Chris wrote and played drums on the Eric Burdon song \\"Heart Attack\\" for the 1981 film Comeback. The song later featured on many of Burdon's compilations, such as The Best of Eric Burdon, Soldier of Fortune, as well as on the original album Power Company, which also featured Snuffy Walden, Ronnie Barron and Terry Wilson.
