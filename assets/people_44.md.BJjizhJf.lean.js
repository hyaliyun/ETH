History An oratory was built at the site in the 11th century, and dedicated to St Michael Archangel, patron of the Camaldolese order and a saint favored by the Lombards. By the 14th century, the oratory had been renamed in memory of Sister Sperandia, a Camaldolese nun who died in Cingoli in 1276. Originally from Gubbio, she had dedicated years to eremitic life in a grotto in Monte Acuto for some years, then moved to a small monastic community here, which was increased by Benedictine nuns from a nearby monastery of San Marco fuori Porta Mentana.Turismo Marche, entry on monastery. The adjacent medieval monastery housed a large monastic community until it was demolished by the Malatesta overlords in 1355. It was rebuilt soon after, and the veneration of body of Santa Sperandia, led to reconsecration of this church in 1562. Documents from 1573, take note of a Camaldolese order, but later ones show dependency on the Monte Cassino Abbey. In 1734 there were 47 nuns, and in 1853, 36. Like many monasteries, it risked suppression during the 19th century, and in 1898, the Benedictine nuns of Osimo moved here. In 2016, it remains an active monastery.Monastero Santa Sperandia, official site. The church underwent refurbishments during the 16th and 17th centuries, leading to its present Baroque decoration. The brick facade is narrow, with a protruding center framed by Tuscan pilasters, and with a small central oculus. The narthex is octagonal, and leads to a single nave with a barrel vault. The main altarpiece is an oval depicting Santa Sperandia and the Miracle of the Cherries, wherein she was fed by an angel while residing in the cave of Monte Acuto. The canvas is painted by Pier Simone Fanelli. The \\"uncorrupted\\" corpse of the Saint is on display in an altar designed between 1633-1639 by Annibale Ricca of Cingoli. Another altarpiece in the church depicts Santa Francesca Romana in Adoration of Madonna and Child by Giuseppe Ghezzi. The counter- fa√ßade has a carved and gilded wood choir and organ loft, attributed to Cosmo Scoccianti.Tourism office of Macerata, by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Provincia di Macerata, entry on the church.

Meals occur primarily at homes, restaurants, and cafeterias, but may occur anywhere. Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. Special meals are usually held in conjunction with such occasions as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling than snacks. The type of meal served or eaten at any given time varies by custom and location. In most modern cultures, three main meals are eaten: in the morning, early afternoon, and evening. Further, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. Some serve dinner as the main meal at midday, with supper as the late afternoon/early evening meal; while others may call their midday meal lunch and their early evening meal supper or dinner. Except for \\"breakfast\\", these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.  Breakfast  Breakfast is the first meal of a day, most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day's work. Some believe it to be the most important meal of the day. The word breakfast literally refers to breaking the fasting period of the prior night.Anderson, Heather Arndt (2013). Breakfast: A History. AltaMira Press. Breakfast foods vary widely from place to place, but often include carbohydrates such as grains or cereals, fruit, vegetables, protein foods like eggs, meat or fish, and beverages such as tea, coffee, milk, or fruit juice, juices often taken first of all. Coffee, milk, tea, juice, breakfast cereals, pancakes, waffles, sausages, French toast, bacon, sweetened breads, fresh fruits, vegetables, eggs, baked beans, muffins, crumpets and toast with butter, margarine, jam or marmalade are common examples of Western breakfast foods, though a large range of preparations and ingredients are associated with breakfast globally. = Variations of breakfast =  Full breakfast  A full breakfast is a breakfast meal, usually including bacon, sausages, eggs, and a variety of other cooked foods, with hot beverages such as coffee or tea. It is especially popular in the UK and Ireland, to the extent that many caf√©s and pubs offer the meal at any time of day as an \\"all-day breakfast\\". It is also popular in other English-speaking countries. In England it is usually referred to as a 'full English breakfast' (often shortened to 'full English') or 'fry-up'. Other regional names and variants include the 'full Scottish', 'full Welsh', 'full Irish' and the 'Ulster fry'. The full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised British dishes, along with such staples as bangers & mash, shepherd's pie, fish and chips and the Christmas dinner. The full breakfast became popular in the British Isles during the Victorian era, and appeared as one among many suggested breakfasts in the home economist Isabella Beeton's The Book of Household Management (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a Continental breakfast, traditionally consisting of tea, milk or coffee and fruit juices with bread, croissants, or pastries.  Instant breakfast  \\"Instant breakfast\\" typically refers to breakfast food products that are manufactured in a powdered form, which are generally prepared with the addition of milk and then consumed as a beverage.Brand Positioning: Strategies for Competitive Advantage - Subroto Sengupta. pp. 5-6. Some instant breakfasts are produced and marketed in liquid form, being pre-mixed. The target market for instant breakfast products includes consumers who tend to be busy, such as working adults.Consumer Behavior in Action: Real-Life Applications for Marketing Managers - Geoffrey P. Lantos. p. 45.  Champagne breakfast  A champagne breakfast is a breakfast served with champagne or sparkling wine. It is a new concept in some countries and is not typical of the role of a breakfast. It may be part of any day or outing considered particularly luxurious or indulgent. The accompanying breakfast is sometimes of a similarly high standard and include rich foods such as salmon, caviar, chocolate or pastries, which would not ordinarily be eaten at breakfastMoscow News - Travel - Swiss—Ü‚ï¢tel Krasnye Holmy or more courses. Instead of as a formal meal the breakfast can be given to the recipient in a basket or hamper. Lunch Lunch, the abbreviation for luncheon, is a light meal typically eaten at midday. The origin of the words lunch and luncheon relate to a small snack originally eaten at any time of the day or night. During the 20th century the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal eaten at midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day after breakfast. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world. In some parts of the UK it can be called dinner or lunch, with the last meal called tea. = Variations of lunch = A packed lunch (also called pack lunch, sack lunch or bag lunch in North America, or packed lunch in the United Kingdom, as well as the regional variations: bagging in Lancashire, Merseyside and Yorkshire,) is a lunch prepared at home and carried to be eaten somewhere else, such as school, a workplace, or at an outing. The food is usually wrapped in plastic, aluminum foil, or paper and can be carried (\\"packed\\") in a lunch box, paper bag (a \\"sack\\"), or plastic bag. While packed lunches are usually taken from home by the people who are going to eat them, in Mumbai, India, tiffin boxes are most often picked up from the home and brought to workplaces later in the day by so-called dabbawallas. It is also possible to buy packed lunches from stores in several countries. Lunch boxes made out of metal, plastic or vinyl are now popular with today's youth. Lunch boxes provide a way to take heavier lunches in a sturdier box or bag. It is also environmentally friendly. = Meal deal = Another variation of lunch is the meal deal, this is a meal often bought from a store and contains the following: a sandwich or pastry, a bag of crisps, salad or fruit and a bottled drink. Meal deals are a staple of many Western high-street supermarkets and convenience stores; they are generally offered at a deal price and are highly convenient for the busy working person. Some stores are now adding premium meal deal items and salads to their meal deal inventory. Critics, however, criticise the meal deal for increasing the levels of single-use plastic waste in circulation and persuading people to buy more food than they originally intended or wanted - contributing to the growing obesity crisis.  Dinner  Dinner usually refers to a significant and important meal of the day, which can be the noon or the evening meal. However, the term dinner can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of the day. Historically, it referred to the first large meal of the day, eaten around noon, and is still sometimes used for a noon- time meal, particularly if it is a large or main meal. For example, Sunday dinner is the name used for a large meal served after the family returned home from the morning's church services, and often based on meat that roasted while the family was out. The evening meal, can be called tea when dinner, generally the largest of the day, is eaten in the middle of the day. = Variations of dinner=  Full course dinner A full-course dinner is a dinner consisting of multiple dishes, or courses. In its simplest, English-based form, it can consist of three to five courses, such as appetizers, fish course, entr√©e, main course and dessert. The traditional courses and their order vary by culture. In the Italian meal structure, there are traditionally four formal courses: antipasto (appetizers), primo (the \\"first\\" course, e.g., a pasta dish), secondo (the \\"second\\" course, e.g., fish or meat), usually accompanied by a contorno (a side dish), and dolce (\\"sweets\\", or dessert). Many traditions conclude a formal meal with coffee, often accompanied with spirits, either separate or mixed in the coffee.  Meals at other times of the day   Meal preparation  Meal preparation, sometimes called \\"meal prep,\\" is the process of planning and preparing meals. It generally involves food preparation, including cooking. = Food preparation = Preparing food for eating generally requires selection, measurement and combination of ingredients in an ordered procedure so as to achieve desired results. Food preparation includes but is not limited to cooking.  Cooking  Cooking or cookery is the art, technology and craft of preparing food for consumption with the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, most notably with ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice.  Eating the meal  Throughout history, meals were normally communal affairs. People got together, shared the food, and perhaps talked over the day. In the 21st century, an increasing number of adults in developed countries eat most or all of their meals alone. It is unclear whether people eating alone eat more, less, or the same amount of food compared to people eating in groups, partly because of differences in whether they are eating alone at home or eating alone in restaurants. Restaurants have responded to the increasing number of people eating alone by accepting reservations for solo diners and installing bar seating and large tables that solo diners can share with others.

It was rejected 59.3% to 40.7%.https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/washington-ballot- measure-732-create-carbon-emission-tax The measure appeared on the November 2016 ballot. The backers of I-732 submitted roughly 350,000 signatures in December 2015 to certify the initiative. The initiative was spearheaded by environmental economist Yoram Bauman, a strong advocate of carbon pricing. It was modeled after the British Columbia carbon tax, which was considered \\"popular across the political spectrum\\". The carbon tax in British Columbia caused the province's fuel consumption to decrease by 16% and its greenhouse gas emissions to decrease 3.5 times faster than the emissions of Canada as a whole, while maintaining steady economic growth. Ballot measure summary The ballot measure summary as written by the Secretary of State of Washington: \\"This measure would impose a carbon emission tax on the sale or use of certain fossil fuels and fossil-fuel-generated electricity, at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in 2017, and increasing gradually to $100 per metric ton (2016 dollars adjusted for inflation), with more gradual phase-in for some users. It would reduce the sales tax rate by one percentage point over two years, increase a low-income sales tax exemption, and reduce certain manufacturing taxes.\\"  Provisions  Initiative 732 contained four provisions: * Creates a new tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels initially set at $15 per ton, rising to $25 per ton after 6 months, and increasing annually to a cap of $100 per ton. * Reduces the Washington State Sales Tax 1% from 6.5% to 5.5% * Reduces the Business and Occupation Tax on Manufacturing Businesses in Washington State to .001% * Funds the Working Families Tax rebate program, a 25% match on the state's version of the earned income tax credit for 460,000 Washington households.  Supporting Organizations  The primary sponsor of Initiative 732 was CarbonWA, a group founded by environmental economist Yoram Bauman to promote carbon pricing. The Audubon Society was also a major proponent of Initiative 732, \\"Audubon Washington believes Initiative 732 provides swift and effective action to reduce carbon pollution\\". Other organizations that supported Initiative 732 included the Sightline Institute, and the Citizens' Climate Lobby. Other supporters include Washington State legislator Joe Fitzgibbon (D), Washington State Senator Steve Litzow (R), Washington State Senator Joe Fain (R), Washington State Senator Cyrus Habib (D), and the editorial board of The Olympian. Climate scientist James Hansen, who has been involved with the Citizens' Climate Lobby for many years, strongly supported the proposal. The backers of initiative 732 claimed that I-732 \\"taxes carbon to fight climate change, boost clean energy, & save the environment for future generations\\".  Non-Supporting Organizations  Several environmental organizations chose to make a recommendation to \\"not support\\" the measure, as opposed to \\"support\\" or \\"oppose\\", including the Sierra Club, 350.org Seattle (who originally supported the measure, and later rescinded their support), and Climate Solutions. Common points made in their statements included concerns that the initiative would result in a budget shortfall, and concerns over how the initiative would spend carbon fee receipts, e.g., Climate Solutions stated:  Opposing Organizations  Opponents to Initiative 732 included the Washington State Labor Council, stating: \\"I-732 would send Washington in the wrong direction and create more damaging austerity choices\\",, the Association of Washington Businesses, and Longview Daily News. Several organizations opposed the measure from an \\"environmental justice\\" perspective, or with a reference to the necessary breadth of the supporting coalition, including Front and Centered (formerly: Communities of Color for Climate Justice), and the Washington Environmental Council, stating:  Aftermath  Although I-732 failed to pass, Carbon Washington continued to work to put a price on carbon emissions in the State of Washington. They worked with others to support Washington Initiative 1631, a carbon tax measure that appeared on the ballots in 2018 but was also rejected.

He is best known for his 1412‚Äì13 mission to Poland‚ÄìLithuania to mediate their territorial dispute with the Teutonic Knights over Samogitia and Masovia in the aftermath of the Battle of Grunwald (1410). His mission did not resolve the dispute and only heightened the tensions. Early life and education Makrai was probably born in the second half of the 1360s. His birthplace is not known, but speculated to be in the Szatm√°r County now split between north-western Romania and north-eastern Hungary. He came from the Gacsalk√©r branch of the Szentem√°g√≥cs kindred as the son of Blaise. His brothers were Sebastian, who served as isp√°n of the chamber of salt (, mentioned in this capacity in 1397 and 1403), and Stephen, the vice-isp√°n of Baranya County under Nicholas Garai (around 1388). After receiving education in Hungary, he attended the Charles University in Prague where he earned master's degree in arts in 1387 and was an examiner in 1388. He soon moved to the University of Vienna where he taught astronomy, one of the arts of the classical quadrivium curriculum, based on Arabic scholar Alchabitius until 1391. He earned licentiate in canon law from the University of Paris by April 1398 and likely a doctorate soon after. He continued his studies and earned the doctorate in civil law from the University of Padua in 1401. Rebellion against Sigismund Upon his return to native Hungary, Makrai became a professor at the University of √ìbuda, founded in 1395. He also got involved in a succession conflict over the Kingdom of Hungary between Ladislaus of Naples and Sigismund of Luxemburg. Rebellious Hungarian nobles imprisoned Sigismund in April 1401 and crowned Ladislaus as King of Hungary in August 1403. However, Ladislaus' army was defeated at P√°poc in September 1403 and Makrai, who had supported Ladislaus, was imprisoned at the end of 1403. His university friends arranged his release in 1408 and, against the odds, he won the king's favor and become his trusted advisor. German chronicler noted that Makrai was sent to diplomatic missions to Catalonia, France, England. Mission to Poland‚ÄìLithuania Map of the Teutonic Order between 1260 and 1410: Samogitia separated the two crusader branches (Teutonic Order in Prussia and Livonian Order in Livonia) From October 1412 to June 1413, he was sent to the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as arbiter in their long territorial dispute with the Teutonic Order over Samogitia. Officially, his task was only to inspect and determine the southern and eastern borders of Samogitia which had never been defined. Makrai first arrived to Marienburg, capital of the Teutonic Order, and received a cold welcome. He then traveled via Ragnit to Trakai where Grand Duke Vytautas organized a feast, knighted Makrai, and showered him with expensive gifts, including golden belt and spurs. The arbitration took place in January 1413 in Kaunas. The Order presented many documents, reaching as far back as donations by King Mindaugas in the 1250s and early 1260s, showing the numerous times that Samogitia was transferred to them (most recently by the Peace of RaciƒÖ≈º of 1404). They also extracted from Vytautas and King Jogaila a confirmation that, as agreed by the Peace of Thorn (1411), Samogitia was ruled by Lithuania only temporarily, i.e. only for the lifetime of Vytautas and Jogaila. However, two days later, this confirmation was protested by representatives of their heirs ‚Äì Vytautas' married daughter Sophia and Jogaila's infant daughter Hedwig. They argued that Vytautas and Jogaila had no right to transfer Samogitia without the approval of their heirs. The protest was joined by 14 Samogitian nobles who argued that the transfer was invalid without the approval of Samogitian nobility which enjoyed greater privileges and had the right to select their ruler. When direct negotiations failed, Makrai returned to his primary goal of determining the border. Both sides presented numerous documents, brought witnesses for testimonies, and swore under oath in support of their position. Particular points of contention were Veliuona and Pie≈°tvƒó, Lithuanian fortresses destroyed during the Lithuanian Crusade and rebuilt by Vytautas, and Memel, Teutonic castle since 1252. Makrai departed Lithuania by the end of February and traveled to Poland to investigate various territorial claims in Mazovia. He was presented evidence that Pomerelia with Gda≈Ñsk was once Polish. He also collected proof that Teutonic Order was not following previous agreements, for example regarding release of prisoners, and sent a couple admonishing letters to Teutonic Grand Master Heinrich von Plauen. On 3 May 1413, Makrai delivered his final decision and recognized that Samogitia took up the entire right bank of the Neman River, including Memel (Klaipƒóda), and thus should belong to Lithuania. The Teutonic Order refused to recognize this ruling, accused Makrai of accepting bribes, and started a campaign to discredit both Makrai and Lithuanian dukes (they fabricated a story that Vytautas' grandfather Gediminas was a low-born hostler of Vytenis). Makrai completed his mission in June 1413 leaving growing tensions behind that spilled into the short but devastating Hunger War in summer 1414. The territorial dispute was settled only by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. Later career During the Council of Constance, Makrai was a member of a small group of special advisers to King Sigismund. Makrai also accompanied the King on his western European trip in high hopes of uniting Christian Europe by ending the Western Schism and brokering peace in the resumed Hundred Years' War between France and England. In a March 1421 letter King Sigismund addressed Makrai as the administrator of the Bishopric of Eger and in June 1421 Pope Martin V confirmed his honorary title of the Count of the Sacred Lateran Palace (comes sacri Lateranensis palatii). That is the last information available on Makrai.

Ailill was of a dynasty known as the D√°l Birn. Osraige was located in modern County Kilkenny, Ireland. Ailill was a \\"Reges Ossairge\\", a King of Osraige, his year of accession is unknown, however, it was after both the reign of C√∫ Cherca mac F√°el√°in, whom had died in 712, and Fland mac Congaile who is without a date. The end of his reign is also unknown, however, by 728 Cellach mac F√°elchair had been recorded King. Ailill is recorded in the Book of Leinster's king lists, and the synchronism's of Thurneysen, Boyle, as well as the Annals of Clonmacnoise. He is recorded as \\"Oillill\\" in the Annals of Clonmacnoise. Ailill does not appear in the MS Rawlinson B 502 genealogies, but it is presumed that this Ailill was the son of F√°el√°n mac Crundma√≠l (died 660), and the brother of C√∫ Cherca mac F√°el√°in (died 712), who were both King's of Osraige. Lineage The D√°l Birn (Old Irish: \\"the assembly\\" or \\"portion\\" of \\"Birn\\") is a tribal epithet found in Irish sources which refers to the descendants of Loegaire Birn Buadach, the hereditary ruling lineage of the kingdom of Osraige in Ireland. For a two-hundred year period beginning the late fifth century, the native D√°l Birn kings were temporarily displaced by an allied Corcu Lo√≠gde dynasty which ruled Osraige until finally being overthrown. A number of the Corcu Lo√≠gde kings are recorded as being periodically slain by the native inhabitants of Osraige until the re- establishment of the D√°l Birn. D√°l Birn descendants remained in control of parts of Osraige, even after the Norman Invasion of Ireland, with the continuation of the Mac Giolla Ph√°draig lordship in Upper Ossory. This senior D√°l Birn lineage historically remained the most visible and in possession of an original portion of Osraige through the death of Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown in 1937.

Incorporated in 1788, the city developed as a major industrial center, and served as a military center during the War of 1812. The district includes mainly 19th and early-20th century commercial, retail, residential and civic properties, as well as the former site of the Monkton Iron Works, once one of the nation's largest iron foundries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The city of Vergennes was first settled in the 1760s, but only began significant growth in the 1780s, when it became one of Vermont's early industrial centers. The city is located at a bend in Otter Creek where there is a falls that could be harnessed for water power, and it also benefited by its location as the crossing point of two major stagecoach routes. It was incorporated as a city in 1788. Sawmills, gristmills, and later other types of industry were all powered by the waters of the creek, and the city experienced growth through the 19th century. One of the major businesses, founded in 1807, was the Monkton Iron Works, which became one of the nation's largest early 19th-century iron foundries. It became a critical factor in the War of 1812, when Vergennes, with ready access to Lake Champlain via Otter Creek, served as a military base. The ironworks and the Macdonough Shipyard both played key roles in the eventual United States victory at the 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh. with The historic district extends primarily along Main Street (now Vermont Route 22A) between Mechanic Street and Monkton Road. It extends northward along both sides of Otter Creek, in order to include the now largely archaeological remnants of the iron works and shipyard. The blocks of Main Street just east of the creek are primarily commercial and civic in character, with 19th and early 20th-century commercial buildings, while it becomes more residential further east. Civic buildings include Vergennes City Hall and the public library.

Originally known as Neuroscience Solutions Corporation, the company was founded in 2002 by neuroscientists Michael Merzenich and Henry Mahncke, who originally intended to help people with schizophrenia. It was renamed Posit Science Corporation in January, 2005. Between 2002 and 2011, the company received about $36 million in funding from venture capitalists and others. During that time, its customers and funding sources included the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health, as well as insurance companies Group Health Cooperative, The Hartford, and Allstate. It grew to have 86 employees in 2007 and then cut staff to 11 by 2011, since revenue was not meeting their expectations. The field of brain training has been driven by advertising making strong claims. Starting in January 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued companies selling \\"brain training\\" programs or other products marketed as improving cognitive function, including WordSmart Corporation, the company that makes Lumosity, for deceptive advertising and later that year the FTC also sued LearningRx; Posit was not sued by the FTC. A 2016 review of studies in the field found that there was some evidence that some of brain training programs improved performance on tasks in which users were trained, less evidence that improvements in performance generalize to related tasks, and almost no evidence that brain training generalizes to everyday cognitive performance; in addition most clinical studies were flawed. In 2017, a group of Australian scientists undertook a systematic review of what studies have been published of commercially available brain training programs in an attempt to give consumers and doctors credible information on which brain training programs are actually scientifically proved to work. Unfortunately, after reviewing close to 8,000 studies about brain training programs marketed to healthy older adults that were studied, most programs had no peer reviewed published evidence of their efficacy and of the seven brain training programs that did, only two of those had multiple studies, including at least one study of high quality: BrainHQ (from Posit Science) and CogniFit. To this date, these 2 online brain training programs are the only programs that were scientifically proven efficient.

The cave is roughly wide, high and deep. It has a single entrance that faces southwest and is well-lit during the daytime. The cave holds alluvial deposits containing the remains of Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoths, ground sloths, and even-toed ungulates. Archaeological excavation of the site in 1983 and 1984 by paleontologists Larry Agenboard and Jim Mead unearthed animal bones, dung, hair, and teeth dating from 11,555 BCE to 9720 BCE, underneath \\"a few feet\\" of cave fill, consisting of ceiling spall and wind-blown sand, containing evidence of Holocene habitation from the Archaic period to the Basketmaker culture and possibly even by Navajo or Paiute. Among the items unearthed were large dung boluses, similar in size to the dung of the African elephant, containing the stems of graminoids and sedge (Carex). The cave is also one of at least seventeen sites on the Colorado Plateau where Archaic-era Southwestern sandals have been discovered. The cave's name derives from a Navajo word meaning \\"big dung\\" or \\"big feces\\". The well-preserved dung layer was deposited over approximately 1,000 years by multiple animal species during a period characterized by the proliferation of oak and the decline of blue spruce and water birch. The organic deposit consists primarily of Columbian mammoth (M. columbi) dung but also includes dung belonging to shrub-oxen (E. collinum), Shasta ground sloths (N. shastensis), Harrington's mountain goats (O. harringtoni), bighorn sheep (O. canadensis), cottontail rabbits, pack rats, and possibly equines. With a thickness ranging between , an area of more than , and a volume of , it is the largest coprolite deposit in North America. Other macrofossils discovered in Bechan Cave include teeth and a bone, a \\"metapodial condyle\\", belonging to E. collinum. The cave is located inside Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and, though it is rarely visited, is accessible on foot from Bowns Canyon. The round-trip hike between Bowns Canyon, which can be reached from Lake Powell by boat, and Bechan Cave is considered moderately difficult.

Brueske died in an attempt to break through the Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe border crossing in a truck, and was the first Berlin Wall victim to die from suffocation.  Life  Klaus Brueske was born on September 14, 1938, in Berlin, Nazi Germany, one of eight children raised in the Friedrichshain area of the city. By 1962, Brueske still lived in Friedrichshain, now in East Berlin, but was a Grenzg√§nger (cross- border commuter) who worked as a truck driver for AEG in West Berlin. Following the abrupt closing of the border and construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August, 1961, by East German authorities, Brueske remained in East Berlin and found a new job as a truck driver. Quickly becoming unhappy with the situation in the East Germany, Brueske started to plan his escape to West Berlin with friends, deciding to break through the border with a truck.Short portrait of Klaus Brueske at chronik-der-mauer.deShort Portrait of Klause Brueske at Gedenkst√§tte-Berliner-Mauer.de, which includes the only known photo of Klaus Brueske Death On April 17, 1962, Brueske borrowed a truck from his workplace then loaded it with sand, and that evening met with six friends who wanted to take part in the escape attempt, where they drank for courage. When Brueske and the men went to the truck to begin they saw Volkspolizei officers nearby, instead parting ways to not to attract any attention from the policemen. At the later meeting, only three of Brueske's friends were still willing to escape. Brueske sat down at the steering wheel to drive, Lothar M. sat in the passenger seat, and Peter G. laid down in the loading area of the truck. After midnight they drove at the Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe border crossing at about 70 km/h (44 mph), breaking through the first two boom barriers, and a soldier of the East German border guards fired a total of 14 shots at the vehicle. The truck came to a halt on the West Berlin side after hitting a wall, but Brueske had died and his friends were injured, and all three were taken to the hospital. Brueske was pronounced dead, and an autopsy of his corpse revealed that he had suffered two non-fatal gunshot injuries to the neck, instead Brueske had suffocated in the sand loaded on the back of the truck, which had poured into the cab due to the impact with the wall. Klaus Brueske's funeral, which his mother and siblings were prohibited from attending by the East German government, took place at the Friedhof L√ºbars cemetery in West Berlin. After Reunification After the German reunification, the Berlin public prosecutor at the Landgericht Berlin brought charges against the border guard who had fired the shots at Brueske's truck. The court sentenced him in 1998 to imprisonment of 14 months, which was converted to probation.

The novel describes the operations of the Young Guard, an anti-German resistance organization operating in 1942‚Äì1943 in and around the city of Krasnodon in the eastern Ukraine. Many of the Young Guard were executed by the Germans. Most of the main characters of the novel ‚Äì Oleg Koshevoy, Juliana Gromova, Lyubov Shevtsova, Ivan Zemnukhov, Sergei Tyulenin, etc. - were actually existing people, although aspects of their characters, actions, and dialogues were invented or creatively embellished by the novelist, and there are also fictional characters in the novel. The Young Guard was the second most popular work of children's literature in the Soviet Union for the period 1918-1986, with total sales over 276 editions of 26,143,000 copies. Historical background : Krasnodon was liberated from German occupation on 14 February 1943 (it had been occupied for less than a year, beginning in the summer of 1942). Immediately afterward, exhumation began of several dozen corpses of members of the Young Guard underground resistance organization from a pit at the Number Five Mine in Krasnodon, who had been tortured before execution by the Germans. Genesis of the novel On the advice of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin, the Central Committee of the Komsomol (Young Communist League) proposed to Fadeyev (an established writer who had already published several novels) that he write a book about the Young Guard. Fadeyev, after reviewing materials collected by the Commission of the Central Committee of the Komsomol Krasnodon, agreed to the project and immediately went to the scene. Fadeev spent most of September 1943 in Krasnodon, collecting materials and interviewing more than a hundred witnesses (although many parents of Young Guards were too heartsick to speak to him). A few months later, Fadeyev published the article \\"Immortality\\" in Pravda, then ‚Äì shocked and captivated by the Young Guards story ‚Äì set his pen to work for a year and a half to create a large multidisciplinary artistic novel. The first version was published in 1946. Prior to publication as a novel, the work was already widely know through publication in The Banner and in Komsomolskaya Pravda (8 April ‚Äì 27 December 1945 and 20 February 20 ‚Äì 1 March 1946); excerpts were published in the Literary Gazette, Soviet Aviation, Pioneer, Change, The Children's Friend, Bonfire, Leningrad Tonight, and Pioneer Pravda. A film version was made in 1948. Second version Fadeyev was strongly criticized because the novel did not vividly display the leading and guiding role of the Communist Party. Pieces offering serious ideological criticism of Fadeev appeared in Pravda, the mouthpiece of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and thus of Stalin himself. In Fadeyev's biography a legendary encounter between Stalin and Fadeyev is reported, in which the dictator is said to have berated Fadeyev with \\"You have written a book that is not just worthless but ideologically harmful. You have represented the Young Guards almost as Makhnovists. But how could they have dealt effectively with the enemy in the occupied territory without Party leadership? Judging by your book they could have.\\" Fadeyev sat down to rewrite the novel, adding new Communist characters, and in 1951 published the second version of the novel. The novel's impact The Young Guard was deemed appropriate for the patriotic education of the younger generation and was made a mandatory element of the school curriculum in 1947. Study of the novel began in the fifth grade; the literary curriculum for the second semester was built on literature as a call to action, beginning with Lermontov's Borodino through excerpts of War and Peace, Gorky's My Childhood and many others, with four lessons on The Young Guard included. The tenth grade curriculum included reading, study and discussion of major sections of the novel. This inclusion of the novel in the curriculum remained essentially unchanged throughout the life of the Soviet Union. (However, after the publication of the 1951 revised version, teachers had to explain the differences in the two versions as being due to the writer's desire to more closely adhere to historical fact rather than to Party intervention; this soon became unneeded as copies of the first version were withdrawn from circulation). By the end of the 1980s the novel was seen as part of the ideological mainstream, and the novel's non-fictitious characters were awarded with medals and streets named after them in various cities, and meetings were held demanding that the traitors who betrayed the Young Guards be found and severely punished (it is generally assumed that the Young Guard was broken with the aid of local informants, although who this was never been determined). Not all the events described by Fadeyev actually happened. The novel contained many errors and inaccuracies which seriously affected the later fate of some real people: several real people who were believed to be prototypes for characters in the novel who were presented as traitors were therefore accused of treason in real life. These persons insisted on their innocence, and were later exonerated. Fadeev explained this with \\"I was not writing a history of the Young Guard, but rather a novel, which allows, indeed requires, literary inventions\\". According to Georgi Arutyuniantz, a Young Guard survivor, Fadeyev told him: Investigation of the events described in the novel : After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the underground movement in Krasondon was further scrutinized. In 1993, a special commission which had been formed to study the history of the Young Guard gave a press conference in Luhansk (described in Isvestia 12 May 1993). After two years of work, the commission's assessment of the various versions of events attracted public interest, even after almost half a century had passed since the events. The conclusions of the commission were limited to a few main points. In July and August 1942, after the capture by the Germans of Luhansk Province, various clandestine youth groups arose spontaneously. These groups, according to the testimony of contemporaries, born names such as \\"Star\\", \\"Hammer\\", \\"Sickle\\", and so forth. What role (if any) the Party had in forming and leading these groups is uncertain. In October 1942, Viktor Tretyakevich united these groups in the Young Guard. It was he, not Oleg Koshevoy (according to the findings of the commission) who became leader of the underground organization. Participation in the Young Guards was almost double what had been thought. The Young Guards undertook risky activities and this led to losses and the eventual failure of the organization.

The film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Arbaaz Khan, and Amy Jackson in the lead roles. Based on the 1996 American comedy film, Happy Gilmore, Freaky Ali was released on 9 September 2016. Plot Ali, an orphaned poor Muslim man, gets fired from a clothing store after he insults a kid who turns out to be the owner's son. He worries that he won't be able to earn money anymore to take care of his Hindu mother, Sulbha but his friend Maqsood motivates him. They approach a rich and royal woman, Padmavati, for money, but manage to do it only after a fight with her. Maqsood, it is shown, works for a gangster, Danger Bhai. Ali is all set to be married but the alliance is broken when the clothing store owner recognizes him and turns out to be a close relative of the bride's family. Dejected, Ali visits a golf course to get some money from a businessman named Singhania. Unaware of what he is up to, Ali pokes fun at Singhania, who challenges him to hit an ace. Ali accepts his challenge and wins it, returning home after collecting the money. Ali's uncle, Kishan Lal, who is a caddy driver for Singhania, tells Ali that if he plays golf he can get rich and become a champion. Motivated by this, he begins training under Kishan's tutelage. Ali contests for a golf tournament, and in the process, falls for royal champion Vikram Rathore's manager Megha, who praises his performance, while Vikram chides him. Ali pays the entry fee and qualifies for the top 60 players. Vikram soon fires Megha and shows his arrogance to Ali, but he retaliates, telling him that golf could be a game for the poor too. He begins winning a number of matches and earns enough money to take care of Sulbha; Megha grows close to him and Sulbha in the process. Danger Bhai, upon the behest of his elder brother, Bade Bhai, tricks and blackmails Maqsood to hijack Ali's success, and a misled Maqsood cunningly substitutes himself for Kishan, misguiding Ali into losing matches. When Megha finds this out, Maqsood's cover is blown and Ali walks away in anger after slapping him. He tries to explain why was he doing this, but Sulbha lectures Maqsood on the importance of honesty. Maqsood regrets and decides to help Ali. Vikram injures Ali's hand on the pretext of congratulating him for getting to the finals; everyone feels worried and starts praying. Ali comes back to the final event with an injured hand which is recovering currently. Bade Bhai joins Danger Bhai, who in turn joins Vikram. Maqsood tells Vikram that he may have broken Ali's hand, but he can't break his courage, and Maqsood becomes the new caddy. Ali gets inspired by his mother, who hits back at Danger Bhai and Bade Bhai for trying to insult her son. Ali then during the match gains his confidence back, removes plaster-bandage and plays perfectly. When Maqsood asks Ali what he's going to do, Ali tells that he's going to \\"hit a six like in cricket\\". Ali executes a great shot flying above the tree and into the hole and Ali wins. Vikram accepts his defeat and lets him go. Bade Bhai praises Ali and declares that he will end all his illegal businesses, and Ali celebrates his victory with his friends and Megha.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The Clark Homestead is located on the west side of China Lake, a Y-shaped body of water that extends north-south across much of the rural community. The main feature of the property is the surviving farmhouse, a single-story wood frame structure. The house is set on a knoll above the lake, and is surrounded by overgrown vegetation. It was built in two parts: the main section is a four- bay Cape style structure facing west, to which a north-facing Cape was appended in the early 19th century. The main entrance features a Greek Revival surround, with sidelight windows and pilasters flanking the door, and a broad entablature above. The interior retains period woodwork, although the original large central chimney has been removed, and its space converted into a food storage area.Watkins, Douglas; Mitchell, Christi (2006). NRHP nomination for Edmund and Rachel Clark Homestead; redacted version available by request from the National Park Service The property on which the Clark Homestead stands was settled in 1774 by Edmund and Rachel Clark, Quakers who were among the early settlers of China along with other members of their family. Edmund Clark was prominent in community affairs, serving at times as tax collector, town constable, and selectman. The property was owned and farmed by generations of Clark descendants, with the house occupied until 2001. Its only modern amenity was a telephone.

The album debuted in the U.S at number 11 on the Billboard 200, with 22,000 copies sold.Chimes of Freedom Debuts at #11 on Billboard! Amnesty International. Retrieved February 2, 2011.  Lyrics  The song's lyrics have brought forth multiple interpretations‚Äîfrom the idea that they are confessional, to Dylan's claims that the album was inspired by literature, to the lyrics being called Dylan's most masterfully written love poem. Many believe the song describes Dylan's relationship issues with his wife during the time when they were separated. Additionally, Ellen Bernstein, a girlfriend of Dylan's in 1974 while he was separated from his wife, claims that the song was about their relationship. However, in interviews Dylan claimed the song was inspired by literature. Rolling Stone reported that in Dylan's memoir, Chronicles: Volume One, \\"Dylan was assumed to be referring to Blood on the Tracks when he wrote: ‚ÄúI would even record an entire album based on Chekhov short stories. Critics thought it was autobiographical ‚Äì that was fine.‚Äù In a Rolling Stone article, Jim James described the song as the \\"essence of love. He's describing everything so viscerally. I can almost smell the trees and different people I've known over the years, the flowers, the sunlight ‚Äì the way things look when you're falling in love and how that turns in on itself when you have to leave or move on or life changes you or changes the other person. He's reflecting on it in such a beautiful way, saying that person will always be a part of him. He'll see her everywhere.\\"  Covers and references  Miley Cyrus (with Johnzo West) covered the song for Amnesty International on Chimes of Freedom: Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International. According to Sean Curnyn's review of the cover version, there were \\"an explosion of amateur performers on YouTube who have been inspired by Miley and are clearly doing their versions of her version.\\" Elvis Costello covered the song on the bonus disk for his album Kojak Variety. The song has been covered by many other artists including Madeleine Peyroux, Shawn Colvin, Raul Malo, Mary Lou Lord, Mary Lee's Corvette, Maria Muldaur, Naked Eyes and Rhett Miller.

It does not include that southeastern part of the historic county which has since 1974 formed a part of the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear The geology of Northumberland in northeast England includes a mix of sedimentary, intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks from the Palaeozoic and Cenozoic eras. Devonian age volcanic rocks and a granite pluton form the Cheviot massif. The geology of the rest of the county is characterised largely by a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous age. These are intruded by both Permian and Palaeogene dykes and sills and the whole is overlain by unconsolidated sediments from the last ice age and the post-glacial period.British Geological Survey 1:625,000 scale geological map Bedrock Geology UK North 5th Edn. NERC 2007 The Whin Sill makes a significant impact on Northumberland's character and the former working of the Northumberland Coalfield significantly influenced the development of the county's economy. The county's geology contributes to a series of significant landscape features around which the Northumberland National Park was designated. Silurian Rocks of the Gala Group outcrop near Berwick. Greywackes originating during the Wenlock epoch of the Silurian Period are assigned to the Riccarton Group and occupy an area either side of the border to the north of Byrness. Devonian =Old Red Sandstone= The late Devonian Stratheden Group is characterised by sandstones with subordinate siltstones and mudstones. A small area of these rocks straddles the border to the southwest of The Cheviot. =Igneous rocks= Rocks assigned to the Cheviot Volcanic Formation, itself within the Reston Group, straddle the border with Scotland. This thick pile (over 1000m) of andesitic lavas was erupted during the early Devonian. The sequence includes rhyolites, agglomerates and tuff. The Cheviot Pluton is a mass of Devonian granite.  Carboniferous  =Yoredale Group= The Inverclyde Group extends from to the Scottish border near Byrness. Rocks of the Border Group extend in a broken and faulted belt south from Berwick towards Alnwick then southwest via Rothbury then onward to the county boundary west of Kielder Water. Within the Border Group the Fell Sandstone Formation reaches up to 370m thickness and is locally prominent around Rothbury Forest where it also forms the Simonside Hills which reach a height of 440m at Tosson Hill. The Yoredale Group comprises, in stratigraphic order i.e. lowermost/oldest first, the Tyne Limestone Formation, Alston Formation and Stainmore Formation. This succession is formed from mudstones, siltstones, sandstones and limestone. The Tyne Limestone forms a narrow and faulted belt of country south and southeast from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Alnwick. It also occupies a large area around Otterburn, Bellingham and Kielder Reservoir extending west to the Cumbrian border. The overlying Alston Formation extends south from the Scottish border along the coastal strip before turning inland through Alnwick towards Greenhead. It plays host to the intrusive Whin Sill. Besides a few inliers further north, the main outcrop of the Stainmore Formation stretches from the coast south of Craster towards Hexham and west along the valley of the South Tyne. =Coal Measures= The sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and coals of the Pennine Coal Measures Group overlie the Stainmore Formation and, from a line roughly between Amble and Derwent Reservoir via Morpeth, Ponteland and Stocksfield, extend eastwards to the coast with a gentle regional dip towards the North Sea basin. The upper Coal Measures are absent from Northumberland. Further small outliers of the lower Coal Measures extend westwards to the Cumbrian border southwest of Haltwhistle. The Northumberland Coalfield is contiguous with the Durham Coalfield to its south. the Tyne valley outliers gave rise to the very minor Stublick, Plenmeller and Midgeholme coalfields. Permian The tholeiitic basalt of the Whin Sill was emplaced during early Permian times. As much as 215 cubic kilometres of quartz-dolerite may have been emplaced within lower Carboniferous bedrock in a sheet which extends to more than 4500 square kilometres of Northumberland and county Durham and which is typically 30m thick. A series of dyke sub-swarms is associated with the sill. Those within Northumberland are referred to as the Holy Island, High Green and St. Oswald's subswarms. The sill provides for characterful topography at Dunstanburgh, Bamburgh, Lindisfarne and neighbouring districts including the Farne Islands, offering several good sites for the construction of castles. Further south it provides the extended north-facing scarp on which the Roman emperor Hadrian had his eponymous wall built. Palaeogene Numerous dykes of Palaeogene age cut the sedimentary rocks of the county. The most significant is the Acklington Dyke which running roughly east-southeastwards from the vicinity of the Scottish town of Hawick parallels the course of the Coquet, running just north of Rothbury and through the village of Acklington towards the coast. The dyke occasionally achieves a width of 30m. A Blyth subswarm and a Sunderland subswarm of broadly parallel dykes are recognised as likely emanating from the same source, the Mull igneous centre in the west of Scotland.Stone, P. et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edn) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey),pp184-5 Structure Northumberland sits above the Iapetus Suture, the line along which the former Iapetus Ocean closed during the Palaeozoic, thereby causing the Caledonian Orogeny. During Carboniferous times, the Northumberland basin occupied the ground between the Cheviot block to the north and the Alston Block to the south. Quaternary  = Glacial legacy = The larger part of the county is mantled by glacial till from the last i.e. Devensian glaciation. There are also a number of areas of glacio-fluvial sands and gravels representing glacially derived material re-worked by rivers. All of this material, till and glacio-fluvial deposits, is assigned to the Caledonia Glacigenic Group; within Northumberland, several different sub-groups are recognised according to the source of the material. North of the Cheviot massif, the till is assigned to the Borders Subgroup and to the south to the North Pennine Subgroup whilst that associated with the massif itself is classed as Cheviot Subgroup. Material originating from offshore (in terms of the present position of the coastline) is assigned to the North Sea Coast Subgroup, though the material along the coast from around Beadnell southwards is of mixed North Sea/Pennine provenance. The Pennine tills are generally dark grey reflecting the nature of the Carboniferous bedrock from which they largely originate.Stone, P. et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edn) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey), pp212-3British Geological Survey 1:625,000 scale geological map Quaternary Map of the United Kingdom South 1st Edn. 1977 =Blown sand= Much of the coast is backed by areas of blown sand, notably at Ross Links south of Lindisfarne, Druridge Bay, at Lynemouth and to the north and south of Blyth. =Raised beach= Raised beach deposits are recorded at Spittal, Berwick-upon-Tweed, at Lindisfarne and around Budle Bay and elsewhere.BGS 1:50,000 scale geological map sheets (England and Wales series) sheet 1&2 Berwick-upon-Tweed and Norham & sheet 4 Holy Island =Peat= Large parts of Northumberland's uplands are blanketed by peat. = Alluvium = The floors of the main river valleys are formed by alluvium, sand, silts and gravel laid down by rivers and streams. River terraces are evident along the Tyne valley and three terraces are developed along that of the River Tweed. Terraces are also developed along the course of the Till, Aln, Coquet, Font, Wansbeck and Breamish.

Photo management Microsoft Photos is a single-instance app. It can organize digital photo collection in its gallery into albums. The default view is Collection, which is sorted by date. Users can also view items by Album or Folder. The album view shows both auto-generated and user-generated albums. The folder view displays files based on their location in on the file system or on OneDrive. Users can choose what folders are displayed and which files are placed in albums. Photo editing Microsoft Photos provides the following basic raster graphics editor functions: * Correction of exposure or colors * Red-eye reduction * Blemish removal * Noise reduction Users can edit with a sidebar similar to the one in Google Photos, which allows them to adjust the photo's shadows, highlights, sharpness, and filters. Further, Photos also allows users to trim, slow down, and save photos from videos. Photo editing technologies developed by Microsoft Research, including Panoramic stitching, Photo Fuse, and AutoCollage are not currently included in Photos. Neither is the ability to batch resize photos, where multiple photos can be resized in a single action. Unlike Photo Gallery, which autosaves edits, Photos only saves when a user clicks the Save or Save As button. Additionally, Photos allows users to compare the original file to the file with unsaved changes and to save the photo with a different name and location. Video editing Main screen of Video Editor Video Editor (formerly Story Remix) is a 3D video editing software built into the Photos app. Intended to replace the older Windows Movie Maker, this feature was added to Microsoft Photos with the Fall Creators Update to Windows 10. Video Editor uses AI and 'deep learning to organize and transform your photos and videos into stories.' Video Editor allows users to create videos from pictures and songs from the Photos app, or by importing them. It also contains features to add, 3D effects, soundtracks, 3D animations and styles to the videos. The tool also includes an \\"Add narration\\" feature in Windows 10 Pro, this allows the user to add multiple audio clips to their video clips. Photo and video import Photos in light mode Photos' photo/video import tool provides the ability to view and select photos that are automatically grouped by date-taken and choose where the files are saved. Photos can show individual pictures, display all pictures in a folder as a slide show, reorient them in 90¬∞ increments or through a granular control, print them either directly or via an online print service, send them in e-mail or save them to a folder or disc. Windows Photo Viewer supports images in BMP, JPEG, JPEG XR (formerly HD Photo), PNG, ICO, GIF, RAW, PANO, and TIFF file formats.  Evolution  Photos is built from a separate code base from those of Photo Gallery and Windows Photo Viewer. It was first included in Windows 8.0 and had a customizable background and a Facebook photo viewer, both of which were removed in the Windows 8.1 update to the app. It also introduced the ability to view immersive PANO files and set a photo as the app's live tile or the Windows lock screen. Like most other apps designed for Windows 8, the controls are hidden until the user right-clicks on the screen. In Windows 10, Photos originally used a hamburger menu for the photo management interface, makes basic controls visible to users, and allows users to set a photo as their desktop background. Unlike most Microsoft apps designed specifically for Windows 10, Photos used round buttons like the ones on Windows 8 for editing. Control categories are listed as buttons on the left side of the app, and specific editing options are listed as buttons on the right side of the app. Folder view and the ability for users to edit albums were added to the app after the initial release on Windows 10 in response to user feedback. Photos includes all features from Windows Photo Viewer except the Burn to Disc feature and may gain more features from Photo Gallery in the future. The original view exclusively featured a dark theme. A major update released in October 2016 replaced the hamburger menu with a ribbon, replaced the radial editing tools with an editing sidebar, and added a fullscreen view, ink editing for photos and videos, and a light theme.

The flag was adopted following the passage of the Quebec Act 1774 whereby French Roman Catholics were granted emancipation and Roman Catholicism adopted as the state church of Quebec. Though it is not known exactly what the design of the flag was, the commonly accepted version consisted of either an altered Red Ensign or Blue Ensign with the words \\"George III Rex (Latin: King) and the Defender of the Liberties of America. No Popery\\".  Background  The Province of New York had the Church of England as the established church in the colony. Following the passage of the Quebec Act granting Catholic emancipation and freedom of religion to Catholics in Quebec at the start of the American Revolutionary War, New Yorkers were angry about it, as they feared it would spread Catholicism around British North America, particularly in the Anglican colonies. American Patriot organisations as a result designed the George Rex Flag as a symbol of protest against the act and Catholicism. They raised it on a liberty pole in the centre of New York at a meeting outside the New York Royal Exchange before spreading throughout the colony. A number of British Army officers and customs officers happened upon the meeting, but it continued peacefully after the meaning of the meeting and the George Rex Flag was explained to them. The flag was also flown from the Liberty Tree on Boston Common. The flag's design came from the New York colonists stating loyalty to King George III, who, as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, had expressed concern about Catholic Emancipation as a violation of his coronation oath. New York patriots viewed the monarchy as a symbol of unification initially until the Battle of Lexington, when people such as Isaac Low made claims that the King had violated his oath by allowing Catholicism in Quebec to try breaking the New York citizenry's loyalty to the crown. Despite this, the flag was then adopted as the unofficial flag of the Province of New York during the war on those grounds. This continued until 1777 when George Washington and the Continental Congress adopted the Grand Union Flag to use as a unified flag for all of the states involved.

The chronicles of the conquest hardly mention it, even though it is only 4 km away from the Conquest tower that stands in Gando's sandy bay (nowadays this tower is used as the museum of Military Aviation). = Four Doors cave (Cuatro Puertas) = The Four Doors cave, or Cuatro Puertas cave, in the northern part of MountBermeja and near the summit, Cuatro Puertas, archaeological site on grancanariapatrimonio.com. is a 17 X 7 metres man-made cave opening towards the north-east, dug in tuff and provided with four large doors, all opening onto the same large space. These doors may have been shut some coverings, made of skins or other materials. Outside, just beyond the porch thus formed, are a series of about 20 post- holes that show that the whole space was enclosed on the outside.(English) Beyond the Beaches of Gran Canaria - Cuatro Puertas and Nearby Sites, p. 1, October 29, 1999. On archaeology.org, published by the Archaeological Institute of America. Numerous deliberate changes / arrangements were made to the tuff walls and floors of the Four Doors cave with the aim of achieving a correct orientation to observe the summer solstice.  Use  The cave's use is not clear. But because of the type and position of the location, the cave's monumental aspect, the closeness of the almogar√©n, and the descriptions of other similar sites in the ethnohistoric chronicles of the conquest, most archaeologists believe that it may have been a sacred place where the worship and rituals were carried out directly by the fayc√°nThe fayc√°n was a religious leader in the pre-Hispanic guanche society, and likely an adviser to the mencey or local king. and the harimaguadas (virgin priestesses under the authority of the fayc√°n, daughters of the nobles). = Ritual place (almogar√©n) = Signs engraved in the tuff at the rituals place In the upper part of the mountain, above and not far east El almogaren y las cuevas artificiales de Cuatro Puertas on estodotuyo.com, site of the Unidad de Patrimonio Hist√≥rico del Cabildo de Gran Canaria (\\"Historical Heritage unit of the Grand from the Four Doors cave, is another cave with a sacred site or ritual space (cazoleta or almogar√©n) where libations and offerings to the gods (such as Alcorac, the Sun) were practised in an enclosed space.

On archaeology.org, published by the Archaeological Institute of America. = Papers' cave (Cueva de los Papeles) = Papers' cave (cueva de los Papeles) The cueva de los Papeles (\\"Papers' cave\\") is in the south part of the mount. It is reached by a path cut in the tuff in the south face of the mount, going east from the ritual place. Its floor plan is more or less circular. its walls bear various engraved triangles, a sign associated with fertility; this cave was probably used for rituals around that theme. = Pillars cave (Cueva de los Pilares) = Pilars cave (Cueva de los Pilares) The same path coming from the ritual place to the Papers' cave leads further to the Pillars cave (Cueva de los Pilares), which is accessed through ramps, stairs and small tunnels. The Pillars' cave (cueva de los Pilares) site is the heart and main part of the troglodyte village of MountBermeja. It is south-orientated, sheltered from the dominant winds and commands a noticeably wide panorama that includes the coast. It may have been surrounded with a thick dry stone wall. Most of the caves are more or less circular inside, many with lateral rooms. There are depressions in the ground for cooking fires, cavities in the walls that would have been used as storage places, seats, holes for beams or posts and grooves for window frames and door frames that would have been shut off with pelts or vegetal cloths. It included granaries and other recesses, the use of which is uncertain. From it, a path going east passes through a rock arch and by a narrow \\"chimney\\" towards the Audience cave and, further up on the eastern slope, at an interesting grindstone quarry - but of difficult access as the path, neglected, has disappeared under opuntia. = The Audience cave = The cave of the Audience (cueva de la Audiencia) has been used for various functions such as sleeping quarters, kitchens, silos, granary and others. It stands about 200 m away from the Four Doors cave, near a narrow and hard-to-locate \\"chimney\\". = The Mills' Quarry (cantera de Molinos) = ; Generalities on hand-grindstones These mills, made of stone, were essential to and even emblematic of house life in the Canaries. Every day the gofio was served - some roasted flour stirred into coffee - and barley was much used for this purpose; other flours were also much used, especially on Gran Canaria island where agriculture dominated the means of subsistence, contrary to the other islands of the archipelago where livestock farming bore the largest part in food production. The two types of stone used for them were either tuff, or vacuolated or vesicular basalt (basalt with many small holes in it, due to gas bubbles trapped in the cooling lava): both provide a rough surface, appropriate for abrasions and grinding; but tuff was 3 times more used than vesicular basalt, the latter for which there is no clear evidence of production centres on the isl. The use of tuff rather than basalt, had a notable wear-effect on the islanders' dentitions. Tuff is made of consolidation (aggregated and compacted) volcanic ash; it is technically an igneous rock but is more akin to a sedimentary rock because of its relatively loose inner structure; it has not been fired and its matter components have not melted together. Basalt on the other hand is an igneous rock made of cooled lava; its matter has been fired and thus has a much higher structural integrity than tuff. This is true also of vesicular or vacuolated basalt that present many small holes within their matter. Therefore tuff parts, more easily than basalt does, with minute pieces of its own material; these ended up in the flour, and wore out teeth noticeably more than a purer flour would. The grindstones were excavated so that the block of stone was in one piece and more or less already shaped underneath on the outside. Thus each of them left a round or oval hollow, or imprint, on the surface of rock it came from. These \\"negative imprints\\" are found all over the surface of the stone quarried, following the relief and remodelling it. Thus their disposition varies with said relief. These traces of extraction are the means by which grindstones quarries are identified. On Gran Canaria island, seven production sites were identified, in the municipalities of Agaete at La Calera site (La Suerte) and El Risco site (near Cuermeja); in Las Palmas at Los Canarios (El Confital) and Monta√±a Quemada sites, both on the Isleta, and at La Cardonera site (Riquianez); in Telde at Cuatro Puertas site; and in Santa Lucia de Tirajana at El Queso site (towards Aldea Blanca and Vecindario). ; Grindstones production in Cuatro Puertas There are two main production sites for hand grindstones in Cuatro Puertas: one dating back to prehistoric times and, immediately next to it on the east side, a more recent historic site. Both are located in the lower portion of the northern slope of MountBermeja, on the path that leads from the village to the cave, further than the Cuatro Puertas cave. Its altitude extends from 197 m to 210 m. It is close to a military zone (escuadrilla log√≠stica de Cuatro Puertas). The site is among a zone of dark-coloured pyroclasts of varying sizes, dating from the Pleistocene era, made of basanite and nephelinite. It is on a steep slope (sloping angle > 45¬∞ in some places). The extraction has created a south-orientated shelf with an irregular face, about 20 m wide and 10 to 14 m high. There is one main extraction place, and several other smaller ones scattered nearby on the same slope of the mountain. This site is in good state of conservation. Its south orientation has preserved it from humidity and from being colonized by lichens (contrary to other sites such as that of Riquianez for example).  Conservation issues  The site has suffered a notable deterioration due to the natural erosion from wind and water, but also to human actions since up to recently the majority of the caves were used and modified to stable goats and sheep. In the fifties of the 20th century this archaeological space was used as cinematographic stage for the filming of the film Tirma, led by Silvana Pampanini. For the filming of one of the scenes a large tuff maquette was realised of the Four Doors cave, generating great deteriorations to the original archaeological space. The Four Doors cave site is listed in Spanish Heritage as a Site of cultural interest in the category \\"Archaeological site\\" since May 25, 1972, by decree nr. 1435/1972. The decree was published in the B.O.E. (Bolet√≠n Oficial de Espa√±a, Spain official journal) nr. 136 on June 7, 1972.

At that time the government was negotiating to buy it and that of other nearby sites. It is currently opened to the public as Archaeological Park.

Biography He was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 28, 1924 to Oscar and Bertha Applebaum. He was the youngest son and second youngest child of nine. His parents immigrated to the United States from Russia on their honeymoon. Oscar Applebaum sold produce door-to-door in St. Paul, Minnesota from a horse-drawn wagon. Oscar opened a fruit stand on the corner of St. Peter and 7th streets in downtown St. Paul with a $65 loan from his eldest son. That fruit stand became the first Applebaum's Food Market. As a young boy, Sid Applebaum bundled soap, bagged rice, worked as a box boy and delivered fruit and produce for his father's fruit stand. Applebaum graduated from Humboldt Senior High School in west St. Paul and continued to grow the family business. By 1979, the family business included about 30 metro-area Applebaum's stores and one in Duluth. In 1979, the chain was sold to National Tea Co., and Applebaum continued on, working for them. The chain was subsequently sold to Gateway Foods. Sid Applebaum and Gateway Foods CEO, D. B. Reinhart, grew the Applebaum's supermarket chain to become the second-largest grocery chain in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area by embracing Applebaum's idea to launch Rainbow Foods by converting some of the old Applebaum stores to the new brand. The chain was founded October 1, 1983. Applebaum was president of Rainbow Foods through several ownership changes until 1996. In 1997, Applebaum bought four Holiday Foods stores in Bloomington, Fridley, Plymouth and Burnsville. Eighteen months later, the stores were sold to Supervalu and were converted to Cub Foods stores. In his final days, he became ill and used a walker. However, Sid Applebaum worked until less than a week before his death in Minnetonka on August 6, 2016 at the age of 92. Applebaum and his wife, Lorraine, would have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary on September 17, 2016. Besides his wife and son and daughter, survivors include another daughter, Nancy Rosenberg of Minnetonka, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Applebaum won many awards and was heavily involved in the Twin Cities community. His children said he helped run the St. Paul Winter Carnival and the Olympic Festival.

In addition to being an address book, it provides a list of recent mail conversations with a selected contact. It used to also be a social media hub, in which users could integrate their social networking accounts (e.g. Twitter), but API changes in both Windows and social media services caused this functionality to break.

Like many Microsoft apps introduced for Windows 8, many of the features and controls were hidden in the Charms Bar or a menu at the bottom of the screen that was triggered by right clicking and it relies on horizontal scrolling through sets of lists. When a user with a Microsoft account added an email account on one computer with Windows 8 People, the account would be automatically added to all other Windows 8 computers the user is logged into. During the initial development of Windows 10, Microsoft deprecated the functionality of the Windows 8 Mail, Calendar, and People apps. It rebuilt the apps with new Windows 10 APIs later in development. While Mail and Calendar were rebuilt as one underlying app, the new People is now a separate app that still interacts with Mail and Calendar. An early concept image for Windows 10's People app show the hamburger menu and history feature, neither of which were present in the initial release of Windows 10. It also shows three features that have not been released: a what's new panel, a link to a messaging app, and a section for managing group contacts. It is unknown if these features are still planned. Although People replicates much of the functionality of Windows Contacts, it is not a true replacement, as Contacts still exists and functions properly in the most recent release of Windows 10. Some apps, including Mail and Calendar, formerly used Windows Contacts to manage contacts but switched to using People to manage contacts.

Fenn, is a widely reprinted learners' dictionary that selected Chinese character entries on the basis of common usage. It was the first Chinese-English dictionary to indicate the neutral tone associated with weak syllables. History Courtenay Hughes Fenn, more commonly known as Courtenay H. Fenn or C. H. Fenn, (1886-1953) was a missionary under the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions in China from 1893 to 1925 (Shavit 1990: 162). Fenn's dictionary was originally intended to be an index of the 5,000 character flashcards used by the North China Union Language School, in the California College in China (later incorporated into Claremont Colleges), Beijing. After compiling the indexing information, Fenn decided to create a pocket dictionary for students of Chinese as a foreign language, and was assisted by Chin Hsien-Tseng. Courtenay H. Fenn's foreword expresses his satisfaction in giving the public a dictionary \\"the lack of which he has personally felt keenly for the more than thirty years of his sojourn in 'The Land of Sinim'\\" (1942: iv), using the Biblical name Sinim (Hebrew for \\"inhabitants of the land of sin\\") that some scholars associate with Greek Sinae \\"China\\". Limiting a Chinese learners' dictionary to 5,000 characters is linguistically sound. Statistical studies of Chinese character usage have shown that an average college-educated Chinese person who is not a specialist in classical literature or history has an active vocabulary of between 3,000 and 4,000 characters (Norman 1988: 73). Fenn's dictionary was preceded by William Edward Soothill's The Student's Four Thousand Tzu and General Pocket Dictionary (1900), and Fenn's colleague Hsien-Tseng Chin later compiled The Three Thousand Dictionary of the Chinese Script (1941). The title of Fenn's dictionary changed through reprinting (Dunn 1977: 79). *The Five Thousand Dictionary: A Chinese-English Dictionary and Index to the Character Cards of the College of Chinese Studies, California College in China (1926) *Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary (1942) *Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary (1944) *The Five Thousand Dictionary: Chinese-English (1973) The first edition of The Five Thousand Dictionary: A Chinese-English Dictionary and Index to the Character Cards of the College of Chinese Studies, California College in China was printed in 1926 by the Mission Book Company in Shanghai. Demand for this dictionary was ongoing and four subsequent editions were printed. The second (1928), third (1932, introduction by W. B. Pettus), and fourth editions (1936, J. D. Hayes) were unchanged reprints. The fifth edition (1940) was a revision by Chin Hsien-Tseng, who had assisted Fenn with the original edition, and George D. Wilder from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Their preface explains the addition of 150 new phrases, deletion of a few obsolete ones, correction of some errors, and inclusion of two tables: \\"Chinese Ordinals\\" and \\"Standard Methods of Showing Pronunciations, including tones\\" (Fenn 1942: vii). The first edition of Fenn's dictionary has 578 pages, and the fifth edition has 697 (Yang 1985: 288). The revised American edition Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary was published by Harvard University Press in 1942. At the beginning of World War II, the shortage of Chinese and Japanese dictionaries became an urgent matter for English-speaking Allies. The Harvard‚ÄìYenching Institute said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had \\"grown from chronic to acute\\", and selected Fenn's The Five Thousand Dictionary (fifth ed., 1940) and A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews (1931) as two \\"practical dictionaries\\" to revise and reprint‚Äîwithout the authors' permission‚Äîfor \\"the immediate demands of American students\\" (Mathews 1943: v). Both photolithographic reproductions were retitled: The Five Thousand Dictionary became Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary (1942) and A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews became Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary (1943). In response to the \\"urgent need\\" for publishing the revised Harvard edition, Fenn's dictionary was basically left unchanged (Fenn 1942: i). Aside from some minor corrections and additions, the Chinese-American linguist Yuen Ren Chao significantly revised the dictionary's introduction on standards of pronunciation, and marked the neutral tone with dots‚Äîthe first Chinese-English dictionary to make this phonological distinction. Harvard University Press changed the original title Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary (1942) to Chinese-English Pocket- Dictionary (1944) for the hardcover edition, and then to The Five Thousand Dictionary: Chinese-English (1973), also in paperback with a redesigned cover that added the characters Â≠óÂÖ∏ (zidian \\"character dictionary\\"). Harvard University Press continued reprinting Fenn's and Mathews' popular Chinese- English dictionaries after the war. By 1984, Fenn's dictionary had sold 34,500 hardcover copies and 18,300 paperback copies (Hall: 1986: 84). Content Fenn's Five Thousand Dictionary comprises 5,000 head characters and about 13,000 usage examples of words (Dunn 1997: 79). The overall collation is by Wade-Giles Romanization, which Fenn says is \\"not because it is ideal, but simply because its recognition is most nearly universal\\" (1942: iv). Each dictionary page has six columns (Fenn 1942: iv-v). The 1st column of each entry gives the head character, with any variant Chinese characters underneath linked by a line at the left, and the Standard Chinese tone indicated by a superscript 1-4 on the character for the 4 tonal categories and a dot before it for the unstressed neutral tone (for example, s.v. n√º3, \\"|‚ãÖÂÖí a girl\\" for n«ö'√©r (Â•≥ÂÖí \\"daughter; girl\\") (1942: 369)). Most Chinese characters are classified as radical-phonetic characters that combine a semantically indicative \\"radical\\" with a phonologically indicative \\"phonetic\\". The 2nd column gives the head character's radical with its number in the 214 Kangxi radicals, and the 3rd gives the phonetic with its number in Soothill's dictionary (1900). The 4th column gives English translation equivalents for the character, common words written with it (abbreviated as \\"|\\" vertical bar), and indicates whether the character pronunciation is colloquial (‰øó) or literary (Êñá), and whether it is used as a Classifier (C) or as a Surname (S). The 5th column gives alternate readings of the character, under which the user may find further information. The 6th column roughly indicates how frequently the character is used in Chinese, using the North China Union Language School's arrangement of the 5,000 character flashcards in ten groups of 500 each, lettered from A to K, with A for the 500 most commonly used characters and K for the 500 least commonly used. The Chinese character ÈÅì (composed of radical 162 Ëæµ or Ëæ∂ \\"walk\\" and a sh«íu È¶ñ \\"head\\" phonetic) for d√†o \\"way; path; say; the Dao\\" or d«éo \\"guide; lead; conduct; instruct; direct\\" makes a good sample entry for illustrating a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Fenn's dictionary enters this character under both Tao pronunciations (1942: 501, 502). The primary d√†o entry gives \\"ÈÅì4 Ëæµ radical 162 È¶ñ phonetic 855 Road, way, passage; zone; doctrine; officer; to say tao3 A\\"‚Äîindicating the 4th \\"high falling\\" tone pronunciation, radical, phonetic, translations, alternate d«éo pronunciation, and group A of 500 most commonly used characters‚Äîand 15 usage examples, including \\"|Êïô doctrine of Taoism\\" for D√†oji√†o (ÈÅìÊïô \\"Daoism (as a religion)\\") and \\"|ÁêÜ right principles, doctrine\\" for d√†oli (ÈÅìÁêÜ \\"reason; rationality; the right way; principle; truth\\"). The cross-referenced d«éo entry gives \\"ÈÅì3 Ëæµ radical 162 È¶ñ phonetic 855 ÈÅé|ÂÖí Narrow passage tao3 A\\"‚Äîindicating the 3rd \\"low dipping\\" tone, same radical and phonetic, a gu√≤d√†or or (Beijing pronunciation) gu√≤d«éor (ÈÅéÈÅìÂÖí \\"passageway; corridor\\") usage example, alternate d√†opronunciation, and same usage frequency group A.

Origins  Antonio Duverg√© Duval was born in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico to a French man, Joseph Duverger, and a French- Dominican, Maria Duval. His grandfather, Alexander Duverger was born in Maul√©on, France and fought for the French against Haitian General Toussaint Louverture. After the invasion of Santo Domingo by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, he was exiled to Puerto Rico with his son Joseph Duverger and his wife Maria Duval. In 1808, when Antonio Duverg√© was one year old, the family returned to Santo Domingo, settling in El Seibo and later in San Cristobal. At that time the Dominican Republic was occupied by Haiti, Jean-Pierre Boyer unified the Spanish island under his rule. The family changed their surname from Duverger to Duverg√© in order to sound more Spanish and not to be confused with Haitians who were the enemy at the time.  Private life  In 1831 Duverg√© married French-Dominican Rosa Montas, the daughter of the leader of the French residents in San Cristobal, with whom he had seven children. He devoted himself to the science of agriculture, livestock and woodwork, becoming well known in the region. He was well known for his friendship with the Puello brothers.  Military life  Duverg√© belonged to the separatist Dominican movement founded by Juan Pablo Duarte in 1838, known as La Trinitaria.

Duverg√© is also known as the Father of the Dominican offensive strategy. Although he had not attended school he was a gifted leader and capable military organizer.  Military trial and death  After the campaign of 1849, Duverg√©'s conflict between him and Pedro Santana increased. Duverg√© was accused of conspiracy against the government of Santana, and was executed in 1855. His remains rest in the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic located in Santo Domingo. Antonio Duverg√© Duval is still known as one of the most prominent leaders of the Dominican military and hero of Dominican national independence. General Duverg√© is the namesake of the city of Duverg√© in the Independencia Province, named in his honor. Likewise, a sector in the capital Santo Domingo was named after him.

She worked at the Oklahoma Historical Society museum for 24 years. She founded the first woman's club in Indian Territory and served as the chair of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Committee of the Oklahoma State Federation of Women's Clubs for 12 years. She was the first woman elected to serve on a school board in the state. Although the Attorney General of Oklahoma ruled she could not serve, she defied the order and completed a two-year term on the Lindsay School Board. In 1928, she was appointed by an assembly of 400-500 Choctaw and Chickasaw tribe members from throughout Oklahoma to chair their convention and then to represent their interests in Washington, D.C. on the pending coal and asphalt resources bill. It was the first time a woman had been sent from either tribe as a representative for their tribe in Washington. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1935. Early life Madeline Czarina Colbert was born on January 14, 1871 in Colbert, in the Chickasaw Nation of Indian Territory to Athenius (n√©e Folsom) and James Allen Colbert. Her father was Chickasaw and involved in tribal affairs of the Chickasaw Nation. Colbert's paternal grandfather, Martin Colbert, was involved in the negotiations for the Chickasaw removal from Mississippi to Indian Territory. He chose to remain in Mississippi and accepted state and US citizenship. Levi Colbert, a paternal great-grandfathere, served as Andrew Jackson's standard-bearer at the Battle of New Orleans. Colbert's mother was of Choctaw descent, the daughter of Rev. Israel Folsom. He was one of the first Native Americans to be ordained as a preacher and to work among the Choctaw. Her great-grandfather, Nathaniel Folsom, married Aiahnichih Ohoyoh, a cousin of noted leader Mushulatubbee. Colbert attended local Chickasaw schools for a few years before going to a convent school, St. Xavier Academy, in Denison, Texas. She studied at Baird College in Clinton, Missouri, and then did additional work at Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Virginia in 1889. She married Michael Conlan on November 6, 1894 in Atoka, in the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory. They had one child, a daughter Lottie. Career In 1896, Conlan organized the Pioneer Club of Atoka, the first women's club in Indian Territory. In 1898, when the women's clubs of Oklahoma decided to come together as the Federation of Women's Clubs for Oklahoma and Indian Territories, Conlan's group joined the federation. In 1899, she was the only delegate from Indian Territory to attend the convention of the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) in Los Angeles. At the time, the GFWC was deeply divided on the issue of race. They did not reach a resolution as to whether the organization would be for \\"whites only\\" until 1902. In 1903, when a group of ten Indian Territory women's clubs withdrew from the Oklahoma Federation to form the Federation of Women's Clubs of Indian Territory, Conlan was elected their first president and the group was admitted to GFWC in 1904. In 1908, a year after Oklahoma statehood, the Indian women's group re-merged with the Oklahoma Women's Club. Conlan served for twelve years as the chair of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Committee of the Oklahoma State Federation of Women's Clubs (OSFWC). The committee was primarily concerned with health issues for women: they conducted hygiene classes at Indian schools and consulted in maternity issues. In 1926, the organization, under Conlan's direction, prepared an index of Native American cultural contributions. In 1932, she was elected as the Director of the OSFWC, which placed her on the national board of the GFWC. Conlan was one of the leading suffragists in Oklahoma. She authored a resolution for the national convention of the GFWC held in Boston in 1908 for women to press state legislatures to allow women to serve on school boards if law did not prohibit it. Conlan was the first woman to serve on a school board in Oklahoma, having been elected to the post on the Lindsay School Board a decade before women's suffrage was granted. Though she was elected in 1909, the state Attorney General ruled that she could not serve. Conlan rallied other women and served in defiance of his order for two years. She later ran for the post of Commissioner of Charities and Corrections in 1914. In 1913, Conlan worked on a Century Chest Project for the Ladies Aid Society of the First English Lutheran Church of Oklahoma City. She was responsible for gathering items from various Oklahoma tribes, including books and documents in their native languages as well as cultural artifacts. The time capsule was opened in 2013 and displayed at the Historical Society Museum. In 1919, Conlan began working as the curator of the Native American collection of the museum run by the Oklahoma Historical Society. Because she was Choctaw, Conlan was often able to secure gifts and items from tribal members for the museum collection, that others might not have been able to acquire. She served as the main collector of Native American artifacts and documents for the museum until 1942. That year, she was dismissed from the post. In 1928, a convention of Choctaw and Chickasaw tribe members from throughout Oklahoma was held in Ardmore. Thy discussed both financial issues and the burdens being placed upon them due to passage and implementation of the Indian Citizenship Act and the Burke Act. Since their tribal governments had been abolished, the tribal members were concerned about the inability to secure funds that were due them for their coal and asphalt lands to provide for their tribe members. Those elected as committee representatives were men, except two women, Conlan for the Choctaw tribe and Estelle Ward for the Chickasaw tribe. Conlan was selected as chair of the convention. The committee met to prepare the recommendations and broke with precedent, sending Conlan and Estelle Chisholm Ward to Washington, D.C. to argue in favor of passage of a bill proposed by U.S. House Representative Wilburn Cartwright for sale of the coal and asphalt holdings, as well as continuing the restrictions of selling Indian lands. It was the first time that women had been sent to Washington as representatives of their tribes. In 1944, Congress finally passed a bill authorizing the sale of the coal and asphalt lands, but there were factions of Choctaw and Chickasaw who were discontented that it had taken so long for their leadership to distribute the funds from the long-promised sale. In the political battle which then ensued between Harry J. W. Belvin and Chief William A. Durant, Conlan threw her support behind Durant, who lost the election. Conlan died on 5 May 1958, in Oklahoma City following a brief illness and was buried at the Fairlawn Cemetery. The Western History Collections at the University of Oklahoma maintains a collection of memorabilia called the \\"Madeline Czarina Colbert Conlan Collection\\". which focuses on Choctaw and other Native American documents. Awards and recognition In 1933, Conlan was nominated to receive the inaugural Indian Achievement Medal of the Indian Council Fire, though she did not win the award, she was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1935.

Jason has decided to dump Rachel since they have both just graduated from high school and are going off to college. Rachel goes inside her house and is scolded by her father for coming home so late. Right before he leaves on his business trip, he informs Rachel that a new employee at his company is coming over to stay in their guest house for a few days. Amy, the new employee, arrives and Rachel shows her around the house and the guest house. Rachel plays a short original instrumental song on the piano and receives praise from Amy. Rachel tells Amy that the guest house used to be her mother‚Äôs art studio before she passed away from cancer. Later that day, as Amy prepares to take a bath, Rachel and she get to know each other, talking about travel and relationships. Rachel reveals that Jason recently dumped her and that she plans to go to college in New York. Later that night, Rachel opens up a bottle of wine for both her and Amy. They talk about love and relationships and Rachel asks Amy if she has ever been in love.

The two girls kiss and admit how much they have missed each other. They later walk by the water near Golden Gate Bridge, and Amy tells Rachel she loves her. Rachel tells Amy she loves her too. The two of them kiss and embrace. Cast *Ruth Reynolds as Rachel *Madeline Merritt as Amy *Tom McCafferty as Frank *Jake Parker as Jason *Jennifer Barlow as Rachel's Mom Production Madeline Merritt originally read for the role of Rachel before being cast as Amy. Neither she nor Reynolds had portrayed a lesbian character on screen prior to this film, though Merritt had previously starred in a stage production of Boston Marriage while at university. Reynolds found that their experience on-set mirrored that of their characters, saying, \\"It was a challenge because we are considered straight, so it was kind of cool to find out how comfortable it was to be with someone of the same gender...even though its something that‚Äôs completely new. So aside from our characters, we discovered it in real life as well\\". The two women became friends during filming. Merritt recalled, \\"When Ruth and I had callbacks, we read together and we just clicked. The chemistry and connection were just there: it wasn't something we had to work at, we really played well off of each other from the start.\\" Reynolds also relished the opportunity to play a musician. Critical response The Guest House received mixed reviews from critics. Writing for AfterEllen, Danielle Riendeau summed up her review by saying: \\"Guest House is largely a fun piece of fluff, with attractive leads and a fun premise, but the film is far, far too chatty for its own good. The writing is spotty, with a few clunky lines, and the final third dives far into melodramatic territory.\\" However, she also noted the \\"fantastic chemistry between Reynolds and Merritt\\" and found the love scenes \\"decidedly hot\\". Dora Mortimer gave the film a negative review for Diva magazine and found that it lacked authenticity, saying: \\"If you're looking for a lesbian film ‚Äì hunt elsewhere. This film's only claim to LGBT issues is having two very femmey members of the same sex feign interest in each other. It is written and directed by a man and it shows.\\" Lauren Shiro of Curve magazine was much more positive, saying: \\"The Guest House is a cute, fun, and highly enjoyable movie. This is a perfect light-hearted, feel good movie for fun weekend entertainment.\\" Ruth Reynolds won the Rising Star Award at the Melbourne Independent Film Festival for her role in the film.

He was one of the protesters who went to the scene after the police's clearance of the \\"civic square\\" occupied by the protesters on 27 September. Political activities Chan was dissatisfied with the student leaders in the protests and called for more radical and militant approaches. He blamed the leaders of the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) for the failure of the movement, and launched the disaffiliation campaign to separate the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Students' Union (HKPUSU) from the HKFS membership as the convenor of the HKPU Disaffiliation Concern Group. The HKPUSU eventually passed the threshold of 1,700 votes in the referendum, with approval for disaffiliation winning with 1,190 votes. After the disaffiliation campaign, Chan began to strive for Hong Kong independence. On 28 March 2016, Chan established the Hong Kong National Party. Chan's move drew attacks from the Chinese state media and Hong Kong government. An editorial piece in the Chinese government-owned Global Times slammed the Hong Kong National Party by stating that it is \\"impossible to achieve\\" independence for Hong Kong and calling it \\"a practical joke\\" and \\"proliferation of extremism in Hong Kong\\". The State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office issued a statement through the official Xinhua News Agency on 30 March 2016, following the declaration of the formation of Hong Kong National Party, condemning the party \\"has harmed the country's sovereignty, security, endangered the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and the core interests of Hong Kong...\\" The Hong Kong government issued a statement after the formation of the party, stating that \\"any suggestion that Hong Kong should be independent or any movement to advocate such 'independence' is against the Basic Law, and will undermine the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and impair the interest of the general public‚Ä¶\\" =2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council elections= In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, Chan's candidacy in the New Territories West was questioned by the returning officer of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC). The EAC required Chan and all other candidates to sign an additional confirm form to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Chan refused to sign the form and his candidacy was \\"invalidated\\" along with five other pro- independence activists after the end of the nomination period. The Hong Kong National Party launched a rally on 5 August which was dubbed the \\"first pro- independence rally in Hong Kong\\" against the EAC's disqualifications. =2018 Foreign Correspondents' Club speech= In a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club, Hong Kong on 14 August 2018, Chan called for Hong Kong's independence from China, calling the latter \\"a threat to all free peoples in the world\\" and \\"our colonial master\\". In response, the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region castigated the FCC for allowing Chan to speak, as did the Hong Kong government. The event gave rise to a controversy involving the de facto banning from Hong Kong of the journalist who presided over the talk. In the absence of an official explanation, Victor Mallet's visa rejection was widely seen to be retribution for his role in chairing the talk, which the FCC refused to cancel. =2019 Osaka G20 Summit and Anti-extradition bill protests= On 27 June 2019, Chan arrived in Osaka, Japan to join separatists from China for a demonstration against the CPC. Prior to his arrival in Osaka, Chan was detained at the airport by the local authorities for three hours. = 2019 arrests = On 2 August 2019, Chan, along with a group of seven others, were arrested during a police raid on a flat in an Industrial Building on Au Pui Wan Street in Sha Tin. The group were detained for offences including possession of explosives without licence, possession of offensive weapons, and selling poisons without licence. Police found two bows and six arrows inside the flat, as well as a suspected petrol bomb, materials for petrol bombs and oils containing cannabis-derived substances. Chan was arrested again on 30 August for rioting and assaulting a police officer at the 2019 Sheung Shui protest as he tried to make his way to Japan.

Family members  One of his sons is Gehad El-Haddad Senior Adviser and Media Spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood. Gehad had become the most recognized face of the Muslim Brotherhood in foreign media during the period following former President Mohamed Morsi's ouster. He held several interviews with international media from inside Rabaa Square where protesters made a sit- in for more than a month. He is now also in Al-Akrab prison in solitary confinement.  Morsi Administration  El-Haddad was appointed as Assistant to President Mohamed Morsi for Foreign Relations and International Cooperation in August 2012. He was leading the country‚Äôs efforts to join the BRICS, and engineered the Egyptian Initiative to end the Syrian Crisis. He also contributed to the cease-fire between Gaza and Israel in 2012. In the 30th of June 2013, after a year of Morsi presidency, millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the resignation of Mohamed Morsi. After 3 days, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi the chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces launched the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat overthrowing president Mohamed Morsi. Before General Sisi made his statement. El-Haddad took to the official Facebook account to post a frightening statement as described by media at that time. The following are parts of it. Dead bodies in RABIA Massacre > As I write these lines I am fully aware that these may be the last lines I > get to post on this page. For the sake of Egypt and for historical accuracy, > let‚Äôs call what is happening by its real name: Military coup. ... On January > 25 I stood in Tahrir square.

That may indeed be true. But what is definitely true is that > there is no democracy without the ballot box. Two months later, troops loyal to Sisi began a bloody crackdown against protestors and dissidents‚Äìlater to be dubbed the August 2013 Rabaa massacre‚Äìthat left 1,400 dead and 16,000 detained.  Under arrest  After Morsi and a number of his aides were taken to an unknown location by the country's armed forces. El-Haddad remained for months in this location without official charges until he was moved in 21 Dec 2013 to Al-Akrab prison. In September 2013 Gehad El-Haddad was arrested in a Nasr City apartment. He is now in the same prison with his father but in different wings where they can't see or contact each other as said by his family. Al-Aqrab (Scorpion) prison in Tora is a notorious maximum-security facility used for political prisoners, who include Muslim Brotherhood and April 6 Youth Movement leaders, as well as political activists. The inmates in this prison suffer from ill-treated, shortage of food and extremely bad conditions for family visits. Essam and his son Gehad are in solitary confinement where they are allowed only one hour of exercise each day inside a closed yard. Colonel Omar Afifi talking about Al- Aqrab stated: > Al-Aqrab prison was designed so that the sunlight never enters any of its > cells during the day. As a result inmates develop other diseases due to the > lack of vitamin D whose scarcity leads to weakness in the mind and in the > body. The prison also suffers from lack of ventilation. During summer > temperature within it rises to unbearable levels while in winter it turns > into a freezer. Essam is still on trial for more than 3 years without conviction till now. Human rights organization consider the political trials in Egypt to lack justice. The director of Amnesty International in Germany, Selmin √áalƒ±≈ükan, has said \\"Mass trial of opposition figures are grossly unfair and make justice more selective\\" She added \\"The Egyptian judiciary has become an instrument for the suppression of the opposition and the free press. At least 20 journalists are currently in prison because they have criticized the government in their coverage or uncovered human rights violations.\\"  Hunger strike  In February 2016, Essam El-Haddad objected when prison officials broke into his cell and insulted him. In response to his protests, officials deprived him from his right to get outside his solitary cell to the prison yard for a week. El-Haddad declared, \\"I am 63 and close to death but I will die with dignity.\\" He was threatened by prison officials that his health won‚Äôt bear such strike but he insisted and a day later prison officials retreated. In the meanwhile, Al-Akrab banned family visits to prisoners from January 24 to February 10, 2016. When visits were resumed, only 30 families were allowed to visit a day in a prison that hosts more than 1,000 detainees. As a result, families had to sleep in the street outside the prison gate the night before their visits to make sure they will be allowed to visit their detainees next day. On February 14, prison guards assaulted the families who refused to leave after being denied the right to see their relatives. Four women were beaten and briefly arrested, and many fell to the ground after being violently pushed by the guards. Several inmates including Gehad El-Haddad, went on strike against ill- treatment and the humiliating conditions of family visits. Under the slogan \\"I am human,\\" the prisoners have set forth four main demands: * Weekly hour-long family visits with no glass barrier * Improving the quality and quantity of food and water to \\"fit human consumption\\" * Allowing packages into the prison * Allowing inmates outside on a daily basis All of which are rights supposed to be guaranteed by the prisons law. Meanwhile, Families of Aqrab Detainees Association made a statement: \\"Major General Hassan Al-Sohagi, Assistant Minister of Interior for the prison sector, met with Aqrab Prison hunger- strikers and gave them a short message: he has \\"a Carte Blanche to deal with this strike\\" in whatever way he liked, from harassing detainees' families, through the prevention of visits, to state-sponsored executions, if this strike is not ended. Detainees rejected the junta regime's threat. It is not clear what was the result of this hunger strike, but inmates of Al-Aqrab still suffer from ill-conditions while their trials are closing to its end.

They closed the school in 1898, and though they tried to reopen with other management the following year, the plans did not come to fruition. In 1902 the school briefly opened as the Clinton College for Young Ladies, but closed after two years. From 1910-1925, the school was operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to train German- speaking ministers for immigrant congregations. The onset of World War I and the patriotism which ensued made the school obsolete, forcing its closure. Baird College Baird College was a women's educational facility founded in 1885, opening on September 29 by Priscilla Baird and Homer T. Baird in Clinton, Missouri. The school was a non-sectarian Christian school. Baird and her husband had previously run a school at Hardin College until the semester ended in June, 1885. The Bairds spent $75,000 to complete the four-story building with three-story wings. There were 55 bedrooms and a total of 110 rooms, not counting the hallways and two large staircases. The fa√ßade was brick on a dressed-stone foundation. Many modern conveniences, including bathrooms on every floor, fire escapes, gas lighting, speaking tubes and electric bells, were provided for the students' comfort. It was advertised as one of the strongest female colleges of the west and within 2 years of its opening boasted of having over 100 boarding students and 300 attendees, being taught elocution, languages, art and music. The school operated until 1897, under the direction of Baird and then was closed for the year of 1898. In 1899, one of the former teachers, was hired to act as president of the school. He claimed to have sole management of the school and solicited money from teachers under the guise of repaying them the advanced money for the lease. When it was discovered that he did not have a lease and had obtained the money under false pretenses, the school was closed. Clinton College for Young Ladies Between 1902 and 1904, the school reopened as the Clinton College for Young Ladies. Clinton Theological Seminary In 1910, the Seventh-day Adventist Church opened the Clinton German Seminary on the grounds and building of Baird College. The school had a grade school, secondary school and a junior college for the first four years of operation, but by 1915 was functioning as a senior college. Initially, the school directive was to teach German-speaking students to be ministers so that they could speak to German immigrant worshippers in their native tongue; however, with the advent of World War I a name change was deemed prudent by then president, Frank Isaac. The school name was changed in 1917 to the Clinton Theological Seminary. As the war continued, many congregations adopted English as their preferred worship language to show their patriotism and confirm that they had joined in their new society. As the need for German-speaking ministers declined, administrators questioned the need for the school, which competed for the same students as Union College in Lincoln, Nebraska. Two fires, one in 1924 and one the following year, sealed the decision for closure, as cost to repair the buildings could not be justified. The school was closed in 1925.

He defeated the incumbent Y≈´ichir≈ç It≈ç at an election held on 10 July 2016. Early life and education Mitazono was born in Ibusuki, Kagoshima in 1958. In 1980 he graduated from Waseda University with a bachelor's degree in education and was employed by TV Asahi as a political journalist. Pre-politics career During his career with TV Asahi, Mitazono was responsible for reporting on national politics. From 1990 he was the political reporter for News Station, Asahi's daily night-time news program. In 2004 he was employed as a part-time lecturer at Waseda University's Graduate School of Public Management. Political career On 31 December 2015 Mitazono announced his intention to run in the July 2016 Kagoshima gubernatorial election as an independent candidate. During a press conference in front of the prefectural government's building, he stated that the gap between regions was widening and that he wanted to revolutionise and bring life to Kagoshima, with ideas to expand the role of women. He also expressed hope that the incumbent governor Y≈´ichir≈ç It≈ç would \\"pass the baton\\", stating that 12 years in office was one chapter. However, It≈ç had already expressed his intention to seek a fourth four-year term in office at a prefectural assembly session earlier in the same month. Mitazono officially declared his candidacy in February 2016 and the pair were the only two candidates when the election was formally announced in June. Mitazono was considered a \\"conservative independent\\" candidate, and received official endorsement from the Democratic and Social Democratic parties. He also received support from conservative local assembly members and former prefectural assembly members, despite the conservative Liberal Democratic and Komeito parties officially endorsing It≈ç. During the campaign, the biggest issue was whether the 12-year governorship of It≈ç should continue, or whether it was time for change in Mitazono. Another point of difference was the candidates' position on nuclear power; in August 2015 the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Satsumasendai, Kagoshima was the first nuclear plant in Japan to restart following the March 2011 Fukushima disaster and the only one in operation at the time of the election. It≈ç accepted the national agency's position to allow the plant to operate for up to 60 years from the date the reactors were commissioned. Conversely, Mitazono called for the plant to be shut down and its safety further investigated. In the election held on 10 July 2016, Mitazono received 55.5% of the vote, defeating It≈ç by a margin of more than 84,000 votes. In Satsumasendai, the location of the operating nuclear plants, Miatzono received 23,176 votes, just seven more than It≈ç. Mitazono took office on 28 July 2016 and stated at a press conference on his first day that he would seek the suspension of operation at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant as early as the following month. He submitted a suspension request to Kyushu Electric Power on 26 August; the company rejected the request on 5 September on the grounds that the reactors are scheduled to undergo periodic inspection later in the year. Mitazono responded by visiting the company's headquarters in Fukuoka to submit a second request two days later.

Career Dennehy debuted for the Boston College Eagles in the fall of 1987, playing four years with the team that included three first place finishes, three NCAA tournament appearances and a Frozen Four appearance in 1990. After graduating, he played for the Ayr Raiders of the now-defunct British Hockey League in their final season of existence, finishing third in scoring for his team. Dennehy earned a tryout with the IHL's Fort Wayne Komets the following season but retired from playing soon thereafter. After nearly a year away from hockey, Dennehy returned to his home state and was brought on by his former BC assistant coach Joe Mallen to help out with team practices for Massachusetts. Dennehy then became a full time coach, joining the staff at Princeton under Don Cahoon. After five years with the Tigers, which saw the program's first ever NCAA tournament appearance in 1998, Dennehy became the head coach for Fairfield. Dennehy took over the program after it posted one of the worst records in NCAA history the year prior of 1‚Äì31. His first season was only slightly better with only three wins in the 1999‚Äì00 season. After the poor season, Dennehy resigned and rejoined Cahoon as an assistant, this time with the Massachusetts Minutemen. He remained as an assistant for an additional five seasons before starting his second stint as a head coach with Merrimack. Prior to Dennehy arriving at Merrimack, the Warriors had not had a winning season since they had joined Hockey East in 1989. His first two seasons saw little success, including a school-worst three-win campaign in his second year, but the college stuck with him and allowed Dennehy to slowly build the program. By year five, the Warriors had risen to 16-wins, their best record since 1994. Dennehy was honored as the 2010 Bob Kullen Coach of the Year, the first Merrimack coach to receive the award. The following season, the team posted 25 wins and recorded their first winning season in over 20 years. The team reached the Hockey East tournament final and made only their second NCAA tournament appearance. After another winning season in 2010‚Äì11, Merrimack returned to sub-.500 records. Dennehy was fired by Merrimack following the 2017‚Äì18 season. He was hired as the head coach of the Wheeling Nailers in the ECHL on May 29, 2018.

History  E3G was established in 2004, when it played a pivotal role in the successful diplomatic effort to get Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In 2006, E3G developed a political analysis called Europe in the World, looking at how the EU could best respond to the challenge of maintaining its prosperity and security in an interdependent world. E3G created the Transform UK coalition in 2009, serving as a cross-sector platform to drive green investment in the UK and spearhead the Green Investment Bank campaign. After much advocacy and analysis, the Green Investment Bank was finally created to support low carbon infrastructure. The bank was established in 2011 with ¬£3 billion in initial equity, taking on full legal status in 2013. In 2010, together with partners, E3G developed and piloted the concept of Low Carbon Zones in China. This led to the Chinese government to establish 12 zones covering 350 million people. The groundbreaking Degrees of Risk report on climate risk management was published in 2011. The report went on to influence the US Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Taskforce. The Energy Bill Revolution was launched the following year in 2012. The campaign set up a coalition of over 200 organisations calling on the UK government to recycle carbon taxes to make all UK fuel poor homes super energy efficient. In the same year, E3G helped to launch the Norstec coalition, an industrial alliance working together on offshore renewable energy in Europe's North Sea.

The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers (OCM) was a London-based company involved in the production of, and trade with, Oriental carpets. Established in 1907/8 in Istanbul, the company set up and controlled their own carpet manufactures in the central Anatolian region around the town of Konya, and from 1911 onwards, in the Hamadan Province in northwestern Iran. In 1968 it was sold, and merged with one of its former affiliates, the Eastern Kayyam Company. From 1924 until 1948, OCM was led by Arthur Cecil Edwards, who, after retiring, wrote a text book on Persian Carpets, which is still in print today. Reprint October 2016  Historical background  Rugs were traditionally woven in Anatolia. Surviving carpets in Anatolian mosques have been dated back to the 13th century Seljuk Sultanate of Rum. Their depiction in a large number of Renaissance paintings demonstrates that carpets and rugs were already exported to Western Europe from the 14th century onwards, where they were regarded as highly prestigious luxury goods. With the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the number of people increased in the Western world who could afford buying oriental rugs. The regions around the towns of Konya and U≈üak were the traditional centers of carpet manufacturing in the Ottoman Empire. Until 1870‚Äì1880, about 75% of all carpets exported to Western Europe were manufactured in these regions. The Ottoman government promoted the commercial production and export of rugs by setting up rug exhibitions, quality controls, and by establishing schools of arts and crafts in Konya and Kƒ±r≈üehir., see: p. 153 As the demand increased by around 1830, Ottoman as well as European and U.S. American trading corporations expanded their commercial activities. European trading companies in Istanbul and Smyrna established their own manufacturing facilities in competition to the traditional Ottoman rug trading organizations based in U≈üak. These companies provided the materials, such as pre-dyed yarns, and issued detailed instructions about the patterns to be woven according to the buyers' taste and market demand. Carpets were woven either by home workers, or in workshops. Working conditions and wages were poor even at that time. Workers in the OCM workshops were working at faster rates, and had lower wages compared to the U≈üak manufacturers. By around 1910, the export from the traditional carpet-producing regions was reduced to merely 10% of the total volume of trade., see: p. 154‚Äì5  History of the OCM  The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Company was established by a group of British merchants at the end of 1907/beginning of 1908 in Smyrna. Looms and other technical equipment were procured in Germany and Austria. The first company- owned production facilities were set up in the Western Anatolian Manisa Province. Already in 1912, OCM controlled the major part of all looms operating in the Konya Vilayet, where 15‚Äì20,000 weavers, mostly women, worked at circa 12,000 looms. In 1911, OCM expanded their activities to Iran. Arthur C. Edwards established a carpet factory in the town of Hamadan, where the production of traditional Persian carpets had totally ceased at that time. In 1924, Edwards moved to London and became OCM's managing director. He expanded the company's commercial activities in the United States. In order to lower the production costs, he set up factories in India, where wages were lower at that time. OCM shares were still listed at the London Stock Exchange in the 1960s, but came under increasing pressure from other companies which produced low-quality carpets and machine-made rugs at mass-market prices. In 1986, the company was finally dissolved, and sold to the Eastern Kayyam Company, one of its former associates.R. P. T. Davenport-Hines, Geoffrey Jones, British Business in Asia since 1860, accessed 9 August 2016  Technical characteristics and pattern designs  Symmetrical, or \\"Turkish\\" carpet knots in a double-wefted foundation (wefts shown in red) In his textbook on Persian carpets, still famous amongst carpet collectors today, A. C. Edwards has documented how he set up OCM's rug production in the western Iranian town of Hamadan. This region was characterized by a tradition of rural village rug weaving, no rugs were woven in the town itself by 1912. Edwards started with eight looms, set up in a small workshop. By 1948, when Edwards retired, more than 1,000 looms were active in the town, with the largest workshop operating 120 looms. He describes in detail the technical and quality criteria which OCM had defined for their production. Several factors were taken into account: The type of knot which was to be used (i.e., symmetrical or \\"turkish\\" vs. asymmetrical or \\"persian\\"), the knot density, twisting and thickness of the yarns used for warps, wefts, and pile, the section of appropriate colours, the patterns and motifs of the rug design, always considering the costs of goods and labour. Edwards opted for a woven foundation with double wefts, similar in structure to the rugs woven in the Kurdish town of Bijar, but with cotton warps and wefts instead of the woolen yarn used in Bijar rugs. The pile was to be knotted with the symmetrical knot, which was traditionally used in the region, and would provide a thicker and heavier pile as compared to asymmetrical knots. A series of prototypes were woven which. as a result, showed that a knot density of 10 x 11 knots per square inch was optimal for weaving a sufficiently dense pattern. High-quality wool was procured from kurdish nomads from the Kermanshah Province. Initially the wool was carded and spun by hand. Later on, carding was done by a machine, but the yarn was always spun by hand. The yarn was dyed with synthetic dyes, the dyeing process was supervised by an Armenian master who had been trained in Germany. However, the resulting colours were of inferior quality, so the company soon switched to traditional Persian natural dyes. The patterns of the design were derived from classical 16th century Safavid period Persian designs, later to be modified according to the U.S. American buyers' taste. To the resulting product, Edwards gave the trade name \\"AlvƒÅnd\\" (after the nearby Alvand mountains), in order to distinguish the OCM rug from the traditional rugs woven in the Hamadan province.

It is also known as or the Ministry of Interior ‚Äì RADA Special Deterrence Forces, or commonly, \\"RADA\\". Its focus is high-profile kidnappings, murders, drug and alcohol poisoning related deaths, illegal migrant smuggling, weapons smuggling, explosives smuggling, terrorist attacks and plots. A lack of political power and police presence in Tripoli provoked the founding of this special unit. The leader is Abdul Raouf Kara. Rada has been involved in tackling non-Islamic activities and dissidents within Tripoli, including fighting against Libyan National Army. History RADA was originally a fighting unit that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in the 17 February 2011 Civil War. After Gaddafi, Abdul Rauf Kara was a member of the police force formed by the Supreme Security Committee with a reported 700 men at his disposal. The Supreme Security Committee (SSC) was then dissolved into the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Libya where his forces were then relabeled as RADA Special Deterrence forces under the guidance of the Ministry of Interior. =Size and composition= The group has an estimated 1500 members. It is the third or fourth largest militia in Tripoli. 90% of their force are legitimate police officers, 70% of whom served in the Libyan police force prior to 2011. Their main areas of operations in Tripoli are the western areas of Soug Al Jouma and Ain Zara. Their headquarters are at Mitiga International Airport.  Operations  RADA operates as an independent department under the Ministry of Interior, and implements a focused anti-narcotics and police force mandate. RADA Special Forces are involved in police work, investigations, arrests, patrols, checkpoints, and other anti-crime activities. This organisation actively and publicly releases images and online footage displaying the seizure of explosives and components smuggled by terrorists, unregulated alcohol seizures, unregulated medical goods such as Tramadol, dollar-dinar black market arrests, arrests of terrorism and terrorist suspects, arrests of kidnappers and other criminals, seizing illegal contraband, etc. RADA operates primarily within Tripoli, but also outside the capital, in cities such as Sabratha, Zawiah, Benghazi, Sirte, Dernah and Zwarah. RADA operates under Islamic Sharia principles with \\"accordance to\\" post Gaddafi era Laws reformed under controversial circumstances by the Islamic Supreme court of Tripoli. Legal and political reforms were made during the Coup detat against House of representatives in the battle of Tripoli of 2013-14 by \\"Libya Dawn\\". As an example, in August 2017, one of Libya's most notorious human and fuel smugglers Fahmi Salim Bin Khalifa was captured as ordered by the Attorney General's Office and praised by the state owned National Oil Corporation. The move is notable due to Libya's 2013 ‚Äì 2017 security vacuum and governance crisis.  Controversy  = Raid on Comiccon Libya = On 3 November 2017, RADA and the Nawasi Brigade in charge of security shut down the officially registeredhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41871697 'Comiccon Libya' event, which hosted around 2000 ‚Äì 3000 people.

The alarm was raised when Facebook groups mistakenly labeled the Comiccon as a Halloween event, implying that the event was hosting pagan material. Commiccon was sponsored by the 'SIGMA' group, and hosted Comics from Marvel and other related material (Otaku) from anime and manga comics. Foam board images of Catwoman, Wonderwoman, and Hulk were torn down, Disney action figures were broken as they \\"represented false idols\\" that were deemed haram by hardline Islamists. The Al Nawasi brigade in charge of security demanded the immediate removal of Japanese art and language writing as some resembled Christian crosses. A Korean ‚Äì Japanese booth selling Japanese kimonos was closed and accused of spreading Buddhism. The organizers of Comiccon faced '\\"legal prosecution\\" for \\"violating public morals\\".https://africatimes.com/2017/11/10/after-libya-comic-con-arrests- still-no-official-word-on-detained-organizers/ References Law enforcement units Law enforcement in Libya Non-military counter-terrorist organizations Organizations established in 2011 2011 establishments in Libya ","title":"RADA Special Deterrence Forces"},{"id":"51270984","text":"Several dynasties named \\"Chalukya\\" ruled in present-day India at various times.

The name comes from the words ' (emu) and ' (referring to a place from which the ancestral being is believed to originate; ' is a waterhole). It is a major sacred site for the (Emu Dreaming), and has been used for ceremonies by the Pitjantjatjara since long before colonisation of Australia.

Ka·∏ªayapi·πØi served as their main home as they moved further north and northeast into the Tomkinson, Mann and Petermann Ranges. The rock hole here was very important during droughts, as there were few sources of water so reliable and permanent in the Great Victoria Desert to the south.

Minister D.S. Senanayake laid the foundation stone for the school on a site, near the Mirigama railway station. The venerable Weweldeniye Medhalankara Thero took the initiative to establish this school and provide higher education for the students in the area. The school was established with a two storey building and other facilities, with an enrolment of 600 students and 25 teachers. The first principal was F. D. Wijesinghe and the new school was called as \\"Mirigama College\\". In 1955 the school was further developed by the principal H. Welikanna. Under his guidance the school became all island volleyball champions and athletes, G.C.E A/L classes were commenced and the number of students increased gradually. In 1958 the first students from the school obtained their university entrance. In 1959 the name of the school was changed to \\"Mirigama Maha Vidyalaya\\" and Hubert Karunarathna was appointed as the principal. In 1964 Minister D. A. Jayathilaka assumed the position as the school's principal. A number of new buildings were constructed and A/L classes were commenced in science and commerce streams. In 1969 the school was expanded with an additional of playing fields, which were opened by then Prime Minister Hon.Dudley Senanayake. W. R. Karunarathna became the principal in 1978. The school was promoted to a central college in June 1979 and was renamed the \\"D.S Senanayaka Central College\\" as a tribute to the country's first Prime Minister, the Hon. D.S. Senanayake.

McMullin was an operations officer of the CIA from 2001‚Äì2010. He then worked for about a year and a half as an investment banker after receiving an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011. He was a senior adviser on national security issues for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2013‚Äì2015, and served as a chief policy director for the House Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives from January 2015 through July 2016. In August 2016, McMullin launched a presidential campaign in the 2016 election for President of the United States, as an independent candidate backed by the organization Better for America. Receiving support from some members of the \\"Never Trump\\" movement, polling taken late in the campaign showed him ahead of major party nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in his home state of Utah. In the end, McMullin received 21.5% in Utah,David Montero, In conservative Utah, Trump underperforms, but so does McMullin, Los Angeles Times (November 9, 2016). taking third place in that state behind Trump and Clinton. Nationally, he received 0.53% of the popular vote. Following his defeat, McMullin has emerged as a vocal critic of the Trump administration.Evan McMullin, Trump's Threat to the Constitution, New York Times (December 5, 2016). He endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.https://twitter.com/EvanMcMullin/status/1299202749947686920  Early life and education  McMullin was born in Provo, Utah, the oldest of four children of David McMullin and Lanie Bullard. At a young age, his family moved to a rural area outside Seattle, Washington, where his father worked as a computer scientist and his mother sold bulk foods to neighbors from the family's garage. After graduating in 1994 from Auburn Senior High School, McMullin spent two years in Brazil as an LDS missionary. Upon returning, he spent a summer working on an Alaskan fishing vessel. In 1997, McMullin began attending Brigham Young University; every year he was in college he did a summer internship with the CIA. He spent a year living in Israel and Jordan and volunteered as a refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2001, McMullin graduated with a Bachelor's degree in International Law and Diplomacy and began formal training with the CIA to become an operations officer. After working for the CIA, McMullin attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he received a Master of Business Administration degree in 2011.  Career  Soon after McMullin joined the CIA, the September 11 attacks occurred, leading to an accelerated training and deployment. He spent the next decade working overseas on counterterrorism and intelligence operations as an operations officer with the National Clandestine Service in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. He was first deployed in 2003 and left the agency in 2010. While the details of his missions remain classified, former CIA officers who worked with McMullin were complimentary of his work, noting his talent for recruiting members of extremist organizations through building trust and willingness to engage in human intelligence outside the confines of the embassy. Some of his missions included information-gathering for efforts against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and collaborating with British intelligence agencies. Near the end of his CIA career, he worked undercover in Iraq. He has stated that his work involved meeting with business and government leaders, as well as collecting information from terrorist operatives. After leaving the CIA and graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011, McMullin began working for the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs, and he remained at the company about a year and a half. In 2012, he volunteered for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, which indirectly led to him being recruited by Republicans on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs looking for an adviser with counter-terrorism experience. In 2013, McMullin was an International Advisory Board member for the Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University. In 2013, McMullin became a senior adviser on national security issues for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for the 113th Congress. In 2015, McMullin became the chief policy director of the House Republican Conference under Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.). It was from this position that he watched the 2016 Republican primaries, and when he began to speak out against Trump he was urged by some Republicans to stay out of the fray. McMullin resigned as chief policy director shortly before declaring his run for the presidency in August 2016. In August 2016, McMullin launched a presidential campaign in the 2016 election for President of the United States, as an independent candidate backed by the organization Better for America. McMullin described himself as a conservative alternative to the two major political parties' candidates, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. McMullin lost the election, receiving 734,737 votes nationwide (0.54%). His best performance came in his native Utah, where he received about 20% of the vote and came in third place behind Trump and Clinton. After the election, McMullin said that he would start a \\"new conservative movement\\" reaching out to \\"non-traditional conservative voters... who feel disaffected.\\" It might, he said, form a new political party.Danica Lawrence, Evan McMullin talks future of conservative movement under Trump presidency, Fox 13 (November 9, 2016). On January 25, 2017, McMullin announced the formation of Stand Up Republic, a nonpartisan watchdog organization meant to ensure that the Trump administration upholds democracy and tells the truth.  2016 presidential campaign  Provo. On August 8, 2016, McMullin announced that he would run as a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election as an independent.Twitter page (\\"Standing up to run for president because it‚Äôs never too late to do the right thing.\\") Retrieved August 8, 2016 McMullin decided to run due to his belief that Republican nominee Donald Trump was unfit for the office and his strong opposition to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's liberalism. He had personally lobbied several Congresspeople to run under the Better for America banner, but when none would run and it was suggested to him that he should run himself, he decided to do so. McMullin had the support of several anti-Trump Republican donors and his presidential bid was also backed by several former members of Better for America, a 501(c)(4) organization dedicated to getting nationwide ballot access for an independent candidate for President in the 2016 election. McMullin's campaign was supported by some members of the \\"Never Trump\\" movement. Trump repeatedly attacked McMullin, referring to him as \\"McMuffin\\" and stating that \\"I never even heard of this guy before. Nobody did.\\" McMullin's late entrance into the race caused him to miss several state ballot deadlines, and ultimately he was only able to appear on the ballot in eleven states, with write-in eligibility in many other states. As such he did not appear on enough ballots to win the necessary Electoral College majority of 270 electoral votes. Instead McMullin hoped to deny a majority of the electoral vote to either of the two major party candidates. In such a scenario, under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the House of Representatives would select the new president from the top-three electoral vote winners. The same day that McMullin launched his independent bid, it was announced that Kahlil Byrd and Chris Ashby, Republican strategists with expertise in third-party ballot access, would form a super PAC called Stand Up America to support McMullin's campaign. Byrd is a former adviser to Better for America. The PAC would be used for TV and digital ads, live events, and grass-roots organizing, but would not sue for ballot access. On October 6, McMullin named Mindy Finn as his running mate. Finn had previously worked for Twitter and as a digital strategist for the RNC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Because Finn's selection came after the ballot paperwork deadlines, Finn did not appear on any of the state ballots. Instead McMullin's friend's name, Nathan Johnson, was submitted as a placeholder. McMullin's support surged in Utah in October after the release of a 2005 audio recording in which Donald Trump was heard bragging in lewd terms about making sexual advances on women. On October 19, an Emerson College poll showed McMullin leading the race in Utah by 4 points over Donald Trump and 7 points over Hillary Clinton. McMullin's popularity in Utah ‚Äì and Trump's unpopularity ‚Äì appears owing to an unusual shift of Mormons away from the Republican candidate. Had McMullin won Utah, it would have been the first time since 1968 that a non-major-party candidate won a state. His strong polling in Utah led Benjamin Morris, writing for FiveThirtyEight, to call him the \\"third- most likely person to be the next president of the United States\\" as of October 13. Ultimately, McMullin came in third place in Utah, receiving 21.54% of the state's popular vote, behind both Donald Trump (who received 45.54% and the state's six electoral votes) and Hillary Clinton (who received 27.46%). McMullin also took third in Idaho with 6.7%. McMullin promised that, despite his defeat, the \\"fight would continue\\" for his new conservative movement. After the 2016 campaign After the 2016 campaign, McMullin has continued to be strongly critical of Trump and Putin. In a December 2016, op-ed, McMullin attacked Trump as a threat to American constitutional government, saying that the president-elect's actions were \\"consistent with the authoritarian playbook\\" and \\"undermined critical democratic norms including peaceful debate and transitions of power, commitment to truth, freedom from foreign interference and abstention from the use of executive power for political retribution.\\" In late January 2017, McMullin and his former running mate Finn announced the establishment of a 501(c)(4) organization, Stand Up Republic.Jennifer Rubin, Evan McMullin makes a splash by going after Trump and Putin, Washington Post (January 25, 2017). The group focuses on \\"defense of democratic (small 'd') norms, constitutionalism and civic involvement.\\" Speaking on so-called \\"alternative facts\\" McMullin said: \\"Undermining truth is a typical authoritarian tactic. It is incredibly dangerous ... We never thought we'd be talking about this in America.\\" In a February 2017 op-ed, McMullin wrote that \\"President Trump's disturbing Russian connections present an acute danger to American national security.\\" He called upon congressional Republicans to \\"recommit to patriotic prudence\\" and \\"demand that Attorney General Jeff Sessions appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Russia's assault on American democracy and Mr. Trump's possible collusion with the Kremlin.Evan McMullin, Republicans, Protect the Nation, New York Times (February 17, 2017). When asked if there was any possibility of him running for Jason Chaffetz's seat in 2018, he answered: \\"It is likely that I will seek public office again. That might be in 2018 or it might be sometime down the road, perhaps very far down the road. I genuinely just don't know yet. I'm very focused on things that I think need to be done ASAP and Mindy Finn and I, with our team at Stand Up Republic, advancing them now.

The prison is located in Chesapeake, Virginia, United States, approximately north of the North Carolina border. The facility was opened in 1994 and specializes in long-term treatment of incarcerated substance abusers. The medium security facility houses inmates in dormitory-style quarters, split into six housing units. In June 2008, the prison had an average daily population of 1,002 inmates. ICCC is adjacent to VADOC's St. Brides Correctional Center, which houses inmates not requiring specialized treatment for substance abuse. History In April 2014, reports of inmates being medically neglected were picked up by local media. One allegation described an inmate as being misdiagnosed with kidney stones by medical staff, who over the course of three months lost approximately , and was later discovered through delayed testing to have terminal pancreatic cancer. Another inmate was alleged to have reported heart attack symptoms to medical staff, and was treated with Advil and was given a suggestion to schedule a follow-up appointment. The inmate allegedly died that night of the heart attack. The American Civil Liberties Union has accused the for-profit companies contracted by the Virginia Department of Corrections of withholding medical care to reduce expenses. On November 8, 2014, inmate Dai‚Äôyaan Qamar Longmire, 19, committed suicide while in solitary confinement at Indian Creek Correctional Center. A lawsuit filed by Longmire's mother against the Virginia Department of Corrections and ICCC, states he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, ADHD and anxiety before his incarceration in May 2014. The lawsuit alleges VADOC did not provide Longmire with medication for his conditions, which he had been taking prior to imprisonment. The suit further alleges prison staff failed to take precautionary measures for an inmate with a history of mental illness, such as placing Longmire on suicide watch, or removing bedding and other objects he could use to injure himself. Longmire had been held in solitary confinement as a punitive measure for misconduct from October 5, 2014, until his death, 34 days later. In May 2016, nine inmates suspected of using scheduled narcotics were hospitalized with overdose symptoms. One of the inmates tested positive for opioids.

The site gained attention in 2015 when then candidate Donald Trump tweeted links to the site. Prntly was listed as being based in New Hampshire but no business registration could be found in 2016. Creator Prntly was founded in 2015 by Alexander M Portelli. Portelli dropped out of high school at age 14, and served time after being arrested at age 19 selling ecstasy. Portelli attempted a mayoral candidacy in Albany, New York, first as a libertarian, then as an independent after the local Libertarian Party disavowed him. Portelli was the only one of six candidates invited to a WAMC discussion. It wasn't clear if he could run for office in New York based on his criminal status, and he dropped out, endorsing his mother as a write-in candidate for the Green party. Portelli owned a overnight diner, \\"Portelli's Joe n‚Äô Dough Cafe\\", opened January 2013 and closed 16 months later. He also owned some ATMs under the trademark AMP Calypso. Portelli also created a left-leaning site, MarshallReport.com, which was less successful than Prntly. After moving to New Hampshire, Portelli created a sites called Porcuprint and Portelli ATM. Portelli launched a Wefunder crowdfunding campaign for Prntpage in 2019 and discussed commercial property in Colorado, managing renters and short-term (AirBnB) properties in Las Vegas in 2020. He also stated he was importing coronavirus antibody tests and masks, stating he has 100,000 masks on hand and 250,000 on their way, selling on eBay, Facebook, and OfferUp, then to restaurants, medical suppliers, and hospitals \\"across the country\\". He said US Customs was seizing half of an order of 40,000 masks in March, so he drove to Los Angeles to get them. He said he was also manufacturing masks in Costa Rica. Portelli lives in Aurora, Colorado. Website Portelli created the site with web developer Josh Barton. The website saw massive growth in readership in the first year of operation, jumping from an anonymous print site with a blog to being one of the top 2000 sites in the United States, with an average monthly visitor rate of a million people during the 2016 election cycle. The Washington Post and RedState reported that then-candidate Donald Trump read the website, and tweeted links to the site. The Post also noted some of its articles were plagiarized. Between 2017 and 2020, the site went defunct due to social media sites cracking down on fact checking. With the 2020 election coming up and the George Floyd Protests, Prntly started up again, claiming Bikers for Trump was planning to invade the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The story was picked up by Big League Politics (\\"pledging to retake Seattle's Capital[sic] Hill Autonomous Zone\\") and Gateway Pundit (\\"Initial Reports: Bikers for Trump and Other Groups Planning to Retake Seattle Occupation Zone on July 4th\\"). Mediaite factchecked with Bikers for Trump, who indicated neither outlet had contacted them. Portelli posted on Facebook that he recruited \\"12,000 patriots\\" for the event. In 2015, Snopes regarded the site as a \\"a disreputable outlet that has a penchant for publishing both fake news and spurious pro-Trump articles.\\" Snopes also documented a case of the site recycling a story from fellow fake/hoax news site Now8News and changing the details. The conservative political blog RedState stated \\"[they] cut and paste text from stories about Donald Trump or Ted Cruz and then give them made up headlines, right off the National Enquirer's editing room floor...[they also run] another site called Marshallreport.com. That site is a pro Bernie Sanders one, and it too cuts and paste stories together with sensational headlines.\\" References Conservative magazines published in the United States Conservatism ","title":"Prntly"},{"id":"51272289","text":"Palot is a village in Didwana Tehsil in Nagaur district of Rajasthan, India.

Within a year of their formation, the band gained a reputation as one of the loudest musical acts in Texas, soon receiving a string of gigs at Houston's Catacomb Club. In 1967, the Heard recorded the \\"Exit 9\\" single, an enduring piece in the musical genre of psychedelic rock. The band's blend of frantic melodies and studio techniques unique to most garage groups has brought praise to \\"Exit 9\\" and its B-side cover version of \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\". History In 1965, twin brothers, Andy (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Randy Clendenen (lead guitar) formed the group with three fellow students from Longview High School‚ÄîBilly Hazard (keyboards), Bill Lewis (bass guitar), and Jack Batman (drums). Although the prelude to the Heard's (they rejected the first proposal of performing under the moniker Johnny Apple and the Seeds) rise to popularity in East Texas are unknown, music historian Andy Brown notes the band made a major splash on the Texan garage band scene in mid-1966. After making appearances in rural and suburban regions, the band promoted to high- publicity gigs in Texas's metropolitan areas of Dallas, Austin, and Houston. Houston in particular brought the Heard the most visibility, as they enjoyed a residency at the Catacomb Club. Andy Clendenen recalled the stay, highlighted by a bill with the Five Americans began when the club's manager, Bob Cope, was impressed by the group's cover of the Kinks' song \\"You Really Got Me\\" at a local battle of the bands competition and the reaction from the audience that followed. Looking to capitalize on their following, the Heard booked studio time at Robin Hood Brian's Studio in Tyler, Texas, where other garage acts like the Basement Wall (the single \\"Never Existed\\") also went to commit songs to record. A state of the art recording studio equipped with an 8-track tape recorder, the only tape of its kind in Texas at the time, and homemade mixing board was at the group's disposal, but only for a one-day session. Much to the band's disapproval, Hood insisted the Heard use a new electronic apparatus called the Cooper Time Cube‚Äîa tape-delay echo device which succeeded in adding a unique effect to the Clendenen brothers' song, \\"Exit 9\\", but also made Andy Clendenen's vocals nearly incomprehensible. Nonetheless, with Clendenen's frantic vocal performance and Lewis's bass replicating the sound of an electric jug, the composition is arguably one of the top Elevators-inspired songs of the era. Despite the rise of flower power in the 1960s, \\"Exit 9\\" was defiantly anti-counterculture, telling listeners to \\"Take your hippies and leave me, child\\". The recording of \\"Exit 9\\" required all of the Heard's time in the studio, leaving the group with the problem of having no B-side for the single. Tight on time and finances, the band booked time at Steve Wright Studios for the following week. The band recorded a rendition of \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\", a popular cover at the Heard's live performances. In June 1967, 500 copies of \\"Exit 9\\" were pressed on One-Way Records, and distributed at the group's gigs. The single was a number one hit in East Texas thanks to a local deejay's high-powered radio station playing the record to a wider audience. Late in 1967, the Heard disbanded when the band members graduated from high school. Although public reaction to the group's single was indifferent at the time, \\"Exit 9\\" is now one of the most-revered recordings of Texas garage rock. The song appears on the compilation albums The Cicadelic Sixties and Texas Flashbacks, while the cover of \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\" is featured on Songs We Taught the Fuzztones. In 2003, Break-a-Way Records released the Heard's recordings on an EP along with another Texan band the Only Ones. In 2012, the compilation The Heard and the Music of The Clendenen Twins was released on CTR Records. The double disc release features all known Heard recordings on one disc and a collection of songs the Clendenen twins recorded in the 1970s on the other. The opening track on disc one is the original 1/2\\" master of \\"Exit 9\\", featuring an infamous toilet flush, which was left off of the original 1967 release. \\"Grinnin' In Your Face\\" an EP by Andrew Clendenen was released in 2018 on BCLLC Records. \\"Cowboydelic\\" an Album by Andrew Clendenen was released in 2019 on BCLLC Records Discography =Single= * \\"Exit 9\\" b/w \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\" - One-Way Records (0001), 1967 =EP= * The Heard Meet the Only Ones - Break-a-Way Records (BREAK007), 2003 =Album= * The Heard and the Music of The Clendenen Twins - CTR Records (CTR1001), 2012 =EP= * Grinnin' In Your Face - Andrew Clendenen - BCLLC Records (BCLLC100), 2018 =Album= * Cowboydelic - Andrew Clendenen - BWCLLC Records (BWCLLC101), 2019 References External links * The Heard web site * Andrew Clendenen web site * The World Of Texas Music with Andrew Clendenen web site Musical groups established in 1965 Psychedelic rock music groups from Texas Garage rock groups from Texas ","title":"The Heard"},{"id":"51272457","text":"Calocosmus dimidiatus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Wheat Veterinary Orthopedic Research Laboratory. One of the focuses of her wide- ranging research is musculoskeletal injuries in racehorses, particularly catastrophic breakdowns. Her identification of risk factors has resulted in improved early detection and changes to horse training and surgical repair methods. On July 30, 2016, Stover received the Lifetime Excellence in Research Award from the American Veterinary Medical Association. In August 2016, she was selected for induction into the University of Kentucky Equine Research Hall of Fame. Education and honors Stover earned her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Washington State University in 1976. She then completed an internship and residency in equine surgery at UC Davis. After working in private practice in Washington state, she returned to UC Davis where she became board certified by the American College of Veterinary Surgeons. In 1987, she earned her Ph.D. in comparative pathology, doing orthopedic research into dorsal metacarpal disease in Thoroughbred racehorses, colloquially known as \\"bucked shins\\". In 2010, Washington State University presented Stover with the Distinguished Veterinary Alumnus Award for Excellence in Teaching and Research after two students that she mentored received James Wilson Awards for the Best Equine Publication by a resident or graduate student, in addition to her own distinguished research. In 2013, UC Davis honored her with the 2013 Alumni Achievement Award \\"for her contributions to veterinary orthopedic research, particularly toward understanding musculoskeletal injuries of racing horses and improving racetrack safety.\\" In 2014, she received a Founders Award from the American College of Veterinary Surgeons (ACVS) in recognition of her wide-ranging orthopedic research, from studies of equine and small animal surgery, to basic bone biology, musculoskeletal diseases and human orthopedics. The ACVS also noted that she had provided clinical training to 26 ACVS residents, was a research advisor for 37 ACVS residents and was an orthopedic research supervisor of 79 graduate academic and 36 DVM students. Of her trainees, 29 went on to hold faculty positions. Colleagues stated: \\"I believe Dr. Sue Stover's contributions to the advancement of equine musculoskeletal health and injury prevention can only be described as monumental,\\" and \\"I would consider this level of advanced training to veterinarians and ACVS residents as unparalleled.\\" She was the first female surgeon and ninth overall to be so recognized. In 2016, Stover received the Lifetime Excellence in Research Award from the American Veterinary Medical Association. \\"Throughout her distinguished career, Dr. Stover has played a pivotal role in improving our understanding of performance-related injuries in racing horses,\\" said Dr. Joe Kinnarney, president of the AVMA. In August, the University of Kentucky announced that she had been selected for induction into their Equine Research Hall of Fame in Lexington. , Stover is a Professor at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, teaching musculoskeletal anatomy, biomechanics, and pathology to veterinary students. She is also the Director of the J. D. Wheat Orthopedic Research Laboratory, and has over 200 research publications. Catastrophic racing injuries Stover is known internationally for her research into equine bone development and its response to repetitive use. In 1994, she published a study on catastrophic breaks of the humerus in racehorses, showing they were most often preceded by stress fractures. She then systematically identified similar stress fractures underlying the development of most performance-related fractures in equine athletes. Another study showed that the risk of a thoroughbred suffering a catastrophic injury was increased by a factor of 16 if the horse was wearing high toe grabs (a cleat on the front of the horseshoe designed to improve traction) on the front feet. In 2008, the graded stakes committee of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association adopted a rule that limited the allowable height of toe grabs on racetracks that hold graded stakes races. In response to the breakdowns of Barbaro and Eight Belles in Triple Crown races, Stover was asked to testify before the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection on the topic \\"Breeding, Drugs and Breakdowns: The State of Thoroughbred Horseracing and the Welfare of the Thoroughbred\\" in June 2008. She stated that although the rise in breakdowns was \\"devastating\\", there were promising initial results from the switch in California to synthetic dirt surfaces. \\"Given time, I'm optimistic we can prevent many more injuries,\\" she said. Subsequent data from the Equine Injury Database showed that the synthetic surfaces were significantly safer to racehorses. For the period of January 1, 2009 through January 31, 2013: * For synthetic tracks, the rate was 1.22 breakdowns per 1,000 starts. * For turf courses, the rate was 1.63 per 1,000. * For dirt surfaces, the rate was 2.08 per 1000. Stover helped develop a \\"track in a box\\" to see how simulated hoof impacts are affected by different surfaces. Stover said, \\"In the laboratory, many new factors ‚Äî for example, new surfaces and horseshoes ‚Äî can be studied that optimize traction while reducing injury risk. Laboratory studies also control the environmental circumstances, thus avoiding the confounding of the results incurred by the multiple environmental variants in natural racetrack settings.\\" Roughly 50% of catastrophic breakdowns involve the fetlock joint, which connects the pastern and cannon bone. When a hoof strikes a racing surface, there is some slide, which helps reduce impact forces in excess of 10,000 Newtons but increases the risk of hyperextension of the joint. If the slide is too short, fractures of the first phalanx (P1) may result. This happens most frequently on turf and may be associated with studs on the horseshoe. On the other hand, Stover said that \\"the more hyperextension the fetlock undergoes, the higher the stresses that are put on the structures that are failing. If we can show that certain surfaces minimize hyperextension, they should minimize catastrophic injuries.\\" Despite the improved safety record, several tracks (including Santa Anita, Del Mar and Keeneland) that installed synthetic surfaces in the mid-2000s had switched back to natural dirt by 2015, a change that made Stover ask, \\"Are we making decisions based on scientific evidence, or things we don‚Äôt know much about?\\" She added, \\"From my perspective, synthetic tracks are still safer. If we modify a surface, it affects every horse that‚Äôs training or racing, and we have the opportunity to make a difference ‚Äì a big difference ‚Äì to those horses.\\" In addition to racing surface and horseshoeing, Stover helped identify other risk factors for the development of fractures, including: * sex ‚Äì intact males are more likely to breakdown than geldings or females * career length ‚Äì the risk of breakdown is higher for horses that have spent more time in active training and that have had a long gap since their last layup * exercise pattern ‚Äì higher exercise intensities over the course of a year also present a significant risk factor Her research has helped lead to better early detection, monitoring of at risk-horses and changes to training methods. These include: * shoeing the horse to make sure the angle of the heel is not too low * engaging in more frequent but shorter high speed works * avoiding too much high speed distance activity over short periods of time * recognizing horses with mild injuries and giving them time to recover Studies directed by her have also led to improvements in surgical repair methods in both large and small animals. She is also involved in research regarding the association between the development of osteoporosis in horses and the inhalation of cytotoxic silicate-laden soil.

Ito was denied a fourth term in office, as Mitazono received 55% of the vote following a campaign based primarily on change as well as opposition to the prefecture's operating nuclear power plant. The election was held on the same day as the national House of Councillors election, which helped increase voter turnout to 58.6%, compared to 43.8% at the previous election in 2012. Background Yuichiro Ito was first elected to the office of governor in a four-candidate race in July 2004, in which the 79-year-old incumbent did not seek re-election. He was re-elected with a large majority in the 2008 and 2012 elections. In 2013 Ito suffered a loss of popularity when he formulated a plan to send prefectural employees for training in Shanghai using public funds, in order to maintain the viability of China Eastern Airlines' failing Kagoshima-Shanghai route. This and concerns about other local issues, including construction of a large-scale sports arena and an industrial waste disposal plant, led to the launch of an official petition in October 2013 seeking Ito's recall. In response the prefecture set up a website explaining the government policy behind decisions made on each of the issues, and the petition ultimately did not receive the required number of signatures during the two-month collection period. In November 2014 Ito approved the restart of the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, which was shut down following the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. This paved the way for the restart of two of the plant's reactors in August and October 2015, the first in the country to be restarted and the only reactors in operation at the time of the election. Local consent to the restart was also given by the Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly and the Satsumasendai city assembly, where the plant is located. The decision was met with protests locally and on a national level, with disruption caused at the prefectural assembly at the time of the vote and former Prime Minister Naoto Kan rallying protestors outside the plant at the time the first reactor was restarted. A series of earthquakes in neighbouring Kumamoto Prefecture in April 2016 caused further concerns about the plant's safety. Election campaign Ito announced his intention to seek a fourth term during a prefectural assembly session on 2 December 2015, stressing his intention not to change his position on the planned construction of a third reactor at the Sendai plant. On 31 December 2015, Satoshi Mitazono, a veteran political journalist with TV Asahi, announced his intention to run in the election as an independent candidate. During a press conference in front of the prefectural government's building, he stated his hope that Ito would \\"pass the baton\\" after 12 years in office. Mitazono officially declared his candidacy in February 2016, stating at this time that, as the power plant had been restarted, the safety and peace of minds of residents was necessary, and that he would \\"aim for a society that did not rely upon nuclear power\\". It was reported that anti-nuclear protest groups were preparing to field an \\"anti-Ito\\" candidate in the election, but the groups eventually supported Mitazono when his position on nuclear power became clearer. Ito and Mitazono were the only two candidates to contest the election, and both ran as officially independent candidates. Ito received official endorsements from the conservative Liberal Democratic and Komeito parties. Mitazono was considered a \\"conservative independent\\" candidate, and received official endorsement from the Democratic and Social Democratic parties, as well as support from anti- nuclear groups and \\"anti-Ito\\" conservative local assembly members and former prefectural assembly members. The main theme of the election campaign was whether to allow Ito's 12-year governorship to continue or to adopt Mitazono's policy of change. The Sankei Shimbun reported that, when campaigning within Kagoshima city and other larger cities, Mitazono stressed his anti-nuclear position and the need for the prefecture to adopt natural and renewable energy sources. On the other hand, when campaigning in regions economically harmed by the nuclear plant shutdown, Mitazono did not speak on the issue of nuclear power at all. It was further reported that, at a private rally in Satsumasendai four days prior to the election, when Mitazono spoke of \\"converting Kagoshima to a natural energy prefecture\\" he received little reaction from the crowd. But his repeated claim that \\"if the governor changes Kagoshima will change\\" received repeated rounds of applause. Ito's campaign rarely addressed the issue of nuclear power, instead stressing his focus on supporting the forestry, agricultural, fishery and tourism industries, with the message that \\"continuity is power\\". At a meeting in Kagoshima city a few days prior to the election, Ito noted that due to the suspension of nuclear power, 3.6 trillion yen had flowed overseas for the purchase of fossil fuels. Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Sadakazu Tanigaki campaigned in Kagoshima city on behalf of Ito and took aim at Mitazono's policies, stating that \\"he can't run the prefecture while being influenced by the Communist Party\\". Results Difference of votes of rates obtained by Mitazono (blue) and Ito (yellow): Mitazono was more supported in mainland cities like Kagoshima and Ibusuki, while Ito was more supported in islands, such as ≈åsumi, Tokara, Amami, as well as Nagashima Mitazono won the two-candidate race, receiving 55.5% of the overall vote and 57.7% in the largely-populated cities of the prefecture. Ito received 59.1% in the smaller towns and villages. In Satsumasendai, the location of the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, Mitazono defeated Ito by just seven votes. Mitazono's victory was seen as a \\"strong anti-nuclear statement\\" and Mitazono confirmed he would seek the suspension of operations at Sendai and further assessment of the plant's safety. Ito, who saw his support drop to 44.5% from the 66.3% he received in the two-candidate 2012 election, avoided speculating on the reasons for his loss during a speech he made on the night of the election. He stated that he had left the prefecture in a \\"perfect condition\\" during his twelve years of office and had a strong conviction that only he could properly handle the next few years. He admitted that he \\"forthrightly accepted\\" the result, but added that victory or loss appeared to be a \\"matter of chance.\\" During the speech he repeated that he felt the electorate understood his policies, while he was \\"a bit worried\\" about the future governance of the prefecture and that he thought it was \\"something he should not have to say\\". Turnout at the election was 56.77%, an almost 13% increase on the previous election in 2012. This was due to an election for the national House of Councillors being conducted on the same day. The village of Toshima, which consists of the Tokara Islands located off the coast of Kyushu, conducted voting on 7 July so that the votes could be counted in Kagoshima city on the 10th. However, poor weather conditions meant that 439 ballots submitted on four of the islands could not be collected on time and were not counted until the 11th.

Gojek was first established in Indonesia in 2009 as a call center to connect consumers to courier delivery and two-wheeled ride-hailing services. Gojek launched its application in 2015 with only four services: GoRide, GoSend, GoShop, and GoFood. Valued at US$10 billion today, Gojek has transformed into a Super App, providing more than 20 services. Gojek operates in Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and Philippines (through the acquisition of Coins.ph). Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company, as well as the country's first \\"decacorn\\" company. It is the only company in Southeast Asia that is included in Fortune's 50 Companies That Changed the World in 2017 and 2019, ranked at 17 and 11, respectively. As of June 2020, it has about 170 million users throughout Southeast Asia. Gojek has won financial backing from investors including Astra International, blibli.com, Google, Facebook, PayPal, Mitsubishi, Sequoia, Northstar, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings, KKR, Warburg Pincus, Visa, Parallon, SCB, Chinese internet giant Tencent, JD.com, meituan.com, Capital Group, among others.  History  Gojek's first logo, used until 21 July 2019. The name Gojek comes from the term ‚ÄúOjek‚Äù or motorbike taxis commonly found throughout Indonesia. Founded in 2009 with 20 motorbike drivers, its fleet now exceeds 1 million drivers and offers 18 app-based on-demand services as of May 2018. Gojek app was launched in January 2015, and in less than two years, the app racked up nearly 30 million downloads. Gojek has partnered with Singapore's biggest bank DBS. Gojek was co-founded by Nadiem Makarim and Michaelangelo Moran. Nadiem, a native Indonesian, holds degrees from Brown University and Harvard Business School. He worked at McKinsey and Co. consulting for three years before starting Gojek from a tiny call centre with only 20 ojek drivers, who later became recruiters. As a loyal ojek user, Nadiem discovered that ojek drivers spend most of their time waiting for customers, while customers waste time walking around looking for an available ojek. Gojek was built to solve this problem, by providing a platform where drivers and riders can connect efficiently and allowing those drivers to improve their income. The other co- founder and long time high school friend, Michaelangelo Moran, aside from serving as the company's Brand Director, is also known for designing the company's first iconic logo and branding the whole company. As of May 2018, the app offers 18 services, with 2 upcoming new services in the online content business, which makes for a total of 20 on-demand services under one platform. Being an Indonesian-run startup played to Gojek's advantage in navigating the local regulatory environment, as well as understanding the local market. This enabled them to bundle features into its app that better suits both local drivers and local consumers. Gojek recruited 100 new graduates in engineering domain from India in 2017. On March 17, 2020, Gojek received $1.2 billion, bringing total funding for its F-Series round to almost $3 billion. = Financing = Gojek's journey in becoming a unicorn startup started in late-2014 when it secured its first financing round from NSI Ventures, the venture capital fund in the Northstar Group. Due to rapid growth in early 2015, Gojek attracted additional investments from Sequoia India and Northstar's private equity fund. After closing a round of funding in August 2016 that raised up to $550 million, two of Indonesia's biggest companies, Astra International, and Blibli.com, invested in Gojek. International investors include tech giants such as American firm Google and Chinese Tencent, along with the global investment company Temasek. A survey revealed Gojek as the most popular ride-hailing app in Indonesia. The company is valued at about $5 billion as of February 2018, which exceeds the total market cap of all transportation companies in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). In May 2018, it was announced that Gojek is investing $500 million towards its international expansion strategy. In January 2019, the startup closed another round of financing for $2 billion. The total valuation of the company reached $9.5 billion. In March 2020, Gojek announced it has received $1.2 Billion in funding for its Series F round. The valuation it was seeking for was U$10 Billion USD. In June 2020, Facebook's messaging platform WhatsApp and PayPal announced they had invested in Gojek as part of the ongoing fundraising round. Whilst not disclosing the size and nature of the investments, the investments were described as \\"meaningful\\". = Acquisitions = The company's rapid growth triggered a chain of acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016, Gojek announced acquisition of two engineering startups based in India, C42 Engineering and CodeIgnition, and established a development centre in Bangalore, India. They also acquired Leftshift, an Indian mobile application developer, and Pianta, an Indian home healthcare startup. In 2017, it acquired Loket.com, one of Indonesia's biggest online ticket booking and event management system company. In the same year, it acquired three large network fintech firm in Indonesia; Kartuku, Midtrans, and Mapan, in order to expand its payments business. In June 2019, it acquired AirCTO, an AI recruiting platform based in Bangalore, India. = Partnerships = In 2016, it announced a collaboration with Blue Bird, a major Indonesian taxi company. The same year it launched Go-Car, expanding ride-hailing from motorbike fleet to cars, and launched Go-Auto, providing on-demand mechanic services. By August 2016, it had become Indonesia's first online transportation system. In running their GPS, it partnered with Google Maps. Other partnerships include entertainment; Google Play and MNC Vision. Bill Payment; AEON Credit Service & Suzuki Finance Indonesia. And the national electricity provider PLN, as well as the national health insurance BPJS Kesehatan. In February 2019, Garuda Indonesia CEO Ari Ashkara told Reuters that Garuda is in advanced discussions with Gojek for the delivery of products sold on Gojek across 17,000 Indonesian Islands. In August 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Gojek had held \\"preliminary talks\\" with Amazon on a partnership that would involve the retail giant making a sizable investment in Gojek to tap into the company's delivery infrastructure in order to expand Amazon's market reach in Indonesia. = Impact = A research study reports that the average income of full-time driver partners (Rp 3.48 million per month) is 1.25 times higher than the average minimum wage in Indonesia (Rp 2.8 million per month).

The ban was lifted the very same day after President Joko Widodo criticized it, stating the government should not prohibit innovation and asserting the ban would adversely affect the lives of many Indonesians who rely on Gojek's services.

The case was significant in relation to the endorsement by the majority of the court of the reserved powers doctrine and as the first case to consider the scope of the power of the Commonwealth regarding trade marks. It also addressed who could challenge a law as unconstitutional. There was a strong division in the Court between the original members , Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ and the two newly appointed justices, Isaacs and Higgins JJ. Background The case concerned the use of union labels to indicate that goods were produced by members of a union. Isaac Isaacs, the then Attorney-General, supported the Trade Marks Bill in parliament, describing the union label as a guarantee of wholesomeness, in respect of the wages, hours of labour, and health requirements that applied to the manufacture of the goods. H.B. Higgins, then a member of the House of Representatives, similarly spoke in support of the union label. The Trade Marks Act 1905 provided that an employer could use the union label if there was a closed shop or if the union agreed.s 74(2) . The Brewery Employees Union of NSW registered a union label as a trade mark. The Attorney-General (NSW) commenced proceedings in the High Court on behalf of four brewing companies in NSW: Tooth & Co., Toohey and Co., the Maitland Brewing Company, and the Castlemaine Brewery and Wood Brothers Company. The brewing companies argued that some people would stop buying their beer if the union label was used and other people would stop buying their beer if the union label was not used and that union label would make it difficult for them to employ workmen who were not members of the union.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at pp. 473‚Äì4. The case considered three issues: * Who had standing to argue that an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament was invalid under the constitution; * Whether the Commonwealth power on Trade Marks was limited by an implication that the Constitution \\"reserved\\" power over intrastate commerce to the States; and * Whether a union label was a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution. Decision Each member of the Court held that the Court would not decide a constitutional question unless it was necessary to do so.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at pp. 491‚Äì492 per Griffith CJ, pp. 553‚Äì554 per Isaacs J pp. 590 per Higgins J. The majority, Griffiths CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ held that Attorney-General for a State had standing to commence proceedings in relation to the constitution and that part of the Trade Marks Act 1905 was invalid, both because of the reserved powers doctrine and because the union label was not a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution. Isaacs J agreed that the Attorney-General had standing to commence the proceedings, but dissented on the basis that the union label was a trade mark and that the trade marks power was not limited by the doctrine of reserved powers.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 589 per Isaacs J. Higgins J dissented on each ground, holding that the Attorney-General did not have standing, that the union label was a trade mark and that the trade marks power was not limited by the doctrine of reserved powers.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 610 per Higgins J. =Standing= The majority, Griffiths CJ, Barton, O'Connor and Isaacs JJ settled the question that the Attorney-General of a State can maintain an action against the Commonwealth to obtain a declaration and consequential relief against the Commonwealth's ultra vires activity. Griffiths CJ held that: > The first condition of any litigation in a Court of Justice is that there > should be a competent plaintiff, i.e., a person who has a direct material > interest in the determination of the question sought to be decided. The > Court will not decide abstract questions, nor will it decide any question > except when raised by some person entitled by reason of his interest to > claim a decision.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 501 per Grifiths > CJ. O'Connor J gave a wider consideration to the role of the several Attorneys- General of the States and of the Commonwealth, holding that the Attorney- General represented not just the State as a legal entity bu the people of that State generally : > \\"In a unitary form of government, as there is only one community and one > public which the Attorney-General represents, the question which has now > been raised cannot arise. It is impossible, therefore, that there can be any > decision either in England or in any of the Australian Colonies before > Federation exactly in point. But it seems to me that in the working out of > the federal system established by the Australian Constitution an extension > of the principle is essential.\\"Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at pp. > 552‚Äì3 per O'Connor J =Reserved powers= The majority, Griffiths CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ held that the power with respect to \\"trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States\\", does not extend to the internal trade and commerce of a State. The intention of the Constitution was that the power to legislate as to internal trade and commerce was reserved to the States, to the exclusion of the Commonwealth as if section 51(i) contained words prohibiting the exercise of such powers by the Commonwealth.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at pp. 502‚Äì3 per Grifiths CJ, pp. 529‚Äì30 per Barton J and p. 532 per O'Connor. = Meaning of trade mark = The majority held that a union label was not a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution in that the constitutional term should be of the technical meaning that it had held in 1900.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 518 per Grifiths CJ, p. 530 per Barton J and p. 540-1 per O'Connor. Griffith CJ said that in 1900 trade marks did not have a signification that embraced union labels in that the a union label did not distinguish the goods made by any particular person or persons from goods manufactured by other persons.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 514 per Griffith CJ. Barton J held that a trade mark was > A mark which is placed on goods (1) to distinguish them as the goods of the > person who uses the mark; (2) exercising dominion over the goods, whether he > has absolute ownership or only a contractual right to the possession; (3) in > the course of his trade; and (4) exercising a right to the exclusive use of > the mark.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 525 per Barton J. O'Connor J held that there were two essential elements of a trade mark, (1) that the proprietor of a trade mark must have some trade or business connection with the goods and (2) the mark must be capable of distinguishing the particular goods from other goods of a like character.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 540 per O'Connor J. The union had no business connection with the goods to which the union label was to be affixed and the mark made no distinction as to the manufacture of the goods.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 at p. 542-3 per O'Connor J. Higgins J held that \\"The usage in 1900 [of the term trade marks] gives us the central type [of legislative power conferred]; it does not give us the circumference of the power. To find the circumference of the power, we take as a centre the thing named‚Äîtrade marks‚Äîwith the meaning as in 1900; but it is a mistake to treat the centre as the radius.\\" Higgins J also held that > ... although we are to interpret the words of the Constitution on the same > principles of interpretation as we apply to any ordinary law, these very > principles of interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and > scope of the Act that we are interpreting ‚Äì to remember that it is a > Constitution, a mechanism under which laws are to be made, and not a mere > Act which declares what the law is to be.Union Label case (1908) 6 CLR 469 > at p. 611-2 per Higgins J.  Subsequent consideration  The decision as to the competence of the Attorney-General of a State to sue the Commonwealth to protect the public from the operation of an invalid federal law was the basis for the development of the modern constitutional doctrine of standing.Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd at [101] per Gummow J. The decision continues to be cited as authority for the long settled practice of the High Court to decline to answer unnecessary constitutional questions.see for example at [355] per Crennan J. The reserved powers doctrine did not have an enduring legacy. By 1920 each member of the majority had left the court. The reserved powers doctrine was rejected by the High Court in the landmark Engineers' case in 1920.. For over three-quarters of a century the Union Label case remained the only decision of the High Court which directly addressed the validity of a law said to have been made under section 51(xviii). However, the narrow approach adopted in that case to the concept of a trade mark was not reflected in decisions of the High Court in the latter part of the 20th century.See for example at [23].

The religious then returned to Certaldo due to the negative Florentine economic and political climate where she became best known for rescuing a child from a burning building. The 1819 confirmation of her local 'cultus' (or popular devotion) - which began almost right after she died - allowed for Pope Pius VII to approve her beatification.

Della Rena sought work outside of her hometown and became a maid to the Timolfi household in Florence. It was there that she became a professed member of the Order of Saint Augustine in its third order branch in 1338 at their church of the Holy Spirit while also receiving the habit. But the tumult in Florence caused her to return home to Certaldo where she rescued a child from a burning building in a move that brought her unwanted fame and attention. She then retired to live the remainder of her life as an anchoress in a small cell that was built to the church of Santi Jacopo e Filippo.

Note the colorful design associated with the label's records. Yorkville Records was a Canadian record label formed in 1966. The label, which itself was a subsidiary of the larger Arc Records, was founded by Arc Records president Phil Anderson originally under the name Yorktown Records. Initially, the record label almost exclusively distributed recordings by the garage rock band the Ugly Ducklings, which resulted in a string of national hits, including \\"Nothin'\\", \\"10:30 Train\\", and \\"She Ain't No Use to Me\\". When Yorktown migrated to Yorkville Records in late 1966, the company signed more musical artists, first earning a minor hit with the Stitch of Tyme's cover of \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\". Yorkville Records is considered the only record company established in Canada to dedicate its efforts specifically on material rooted in the musical genre of psychedelic rock, releasing additional records by the Quiet Jungle, the Sugar Shoppe, and Willapuss, among others. Additionally, Yorkville released several compilation albums such as Yorkville Evolution and After Four. The label remained active until 1971. Music historian Piers A. Hemmingsen attributed the collectibility of Yorkville's catalogue to \\"The bright colours of the label and the unique collection of artists make this a label that record collectors love\\".

It was the first commodities exchange established in Turkey and focuses on agricultural products. It functions in accordance with the Turkish Law No. 5174 regarding the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey and the Chambers and Commodity Exchanges. History The ƒ∞zmir Commodity Exchange was established in ƒ∞zmir, the 3rd largest province of Turkey, in 1891 as the first commodity exchange of Turkey. ƒ∞zmir has always been an important hub for agricultural production and one of the centers for domestic and foreign trade throughout the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey. In fact, ƒ∞zmir harbour was the most important export harbour of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, which made the city the host for the first efforts to systemize the agricultural markets and the first commodity exchange of Turkey. In the second half of the 19th century, the boost in the volume of the trade in ƒ∞zmir urged the merchants to seek for new methods and regulations in order to catch up with novelties. Although new warehouses had been built to store the goods, unbalanced price adjustments, lack of proper statistics to determine demand and supply, and uncertainty of the money markets used to negatively affect the commercial life of the city. These problems caused the tradesmen and producers to suffer great losses. The tradesmen of ƒ∞zmir commenced to make several attempts to overcome these problems. The Commercial Assembly and ƒ∞zmir Chamber of Commerce were established in 1850 and 1885, respectively. The English, French, Italians and the Dutch had their own chambers of commerce in ƒ∞zmir. However, these attempts had fallen behind in creating solutions to the problems of the market. Although the first legal arrangements in the Ottoman Empire were carried out in 1886, it is known that some attempts were made before this date to establish a commodity exchange in ƒ∞zmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Ni≈üli Hacƒ± Ali Efendi was used as ‚Äúthe grain exchange‚Äù just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern commodity exchange based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different commodity exchanges were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General Commodity Exchange regulations specified only one commodity exchange in each city. Therefore, upon the inspections by the Ministry of Public Works, Ni≈üli Hacƒ± Ali Efendi's Commodity Exchange was declared as the sole legal exchange in the city and it was inaugurated with a ceremony on Monday, 13 June 1892. The first elections were held at the end of that year and the first board of directors was formed. The regulations came into effect on 21 January 1895. The products traded at the Exchange in 1897 were barley, wheat, refined flour, semolina, bran, rye, flour, corn, maize, chickpea, dry beans, black-eyed pea, hemp seed, vetch, aniseed, dent corn, sesame, broad bean, poppy seed, olive oil, cotton, cotton seed and opium poppy. The public was informed daily of the transactions and prices through the local newspapers, which made monitoring supply and demand volume of the market possible. As the economic life was severely damaged and agricultural production decreased during the World War I and Turkish Independence War, ƒ∞zmir Commodity Exchange experienced rough times. Following the independence of Turkey and declaration of the republic, the present building of the ƒ∞zmir Commodity Exchange was built and opened with a ceremony on 11 June 1928. Since then, ƒ∞zmir Commodity Exchange has been serving its members and the society in general in the same building, the Exchange Palace, located at Gazi Boulevard No:2, Konak/ƒ∞zmir.

Ballachi served as a former soldier in Rimini before renouncing that path in favor of the religious life where he became a gardener noted for his strict adherence to the rule of Saint Dominic. Ballachi's local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - received approval from Pope Pius VII on 14 March 1820 which allowed for him to approve the late friar's beatification. Life Simone Ballachi was born in Rimini in 1240 to the nobleman Count Rodolfo Ballachi. His noble household had close connections to the Roman Catholic Church since his two paternal uncles would serve as the Bishops of Rimini while a little brother of Ballachi's would become a priest. The uncles served one after the other as bishop and were Lorenzo (d. 1302) who was a member of the Order of Preachers and Federico (d. 1321). Ballachi received training as a soldier and was expected to take over his father's estates though against the latter's wishes he renounced this and joined the Third Order of Saint Dominic in 1267. Ballachi served as the convent's gardener - despite having a limited knowledge of how best to care for a garden - but grew to love it almost as soon as he began working in the garden. He would sweep the convent each week. He became noted amongst the friars there for his simple life and for his strict adherence to the order's rule while becoming a renowned catechist for children. He also began to discipline himself with corporal penances for the conversion of sinners while for two decades wearing an iron chain as penance. For five entire Lenten seasons he fasted on bread and water alone and his fasting's weakened him to the point where his superiors had to intervene in order for him to sustain his health and not damage it. He experienced several visions from the Devil but also received visions from the Madonna. He also had visions of Dominic of Osma and Peter of Verona who would speak to him to console him in times of hardship. Some friars even reported seeing his cell glowing and heard angelic voices from his cell. One time a voice even said to him: \\"Fear not Simone for thou hast found favor before God\\". Ballachi also fostered a special devotion to Catherine of Alexandria and on one occasion she appeared to him and healed him when he was suffering from a severe headache. He became blind in 1297 and devoted the remainder of his life to solitude. Ballachi died on 5 November 1319. Beatification The confirmation of his local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - allowed for Pope Pius VII to approve Ballachi's beatification on 14 March 1820.

Plants are halophytes with fleshy, apparently articulated plant stems and reduced leaves and flowers. There are two species, occurring from Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region, to western tropical Africa and Macaronesia. An American species will have to be excluded.  Description  The species of Arthrocnemum are low shrubs up to , much branched from base, and often forming mats. Young stems are succulent, glaucous (sometimes yellowish), glabrous, and appear to be articulated. The opposite leaves are sessile, joined at base and forming a cup around the stem, fleshy, glabrous, their blades reduced to small, cuspidate scales up to 5 mm. The spike-like inflorescences stand terminal on lateral branches, they are not branched or with short lateral branches. Cymes of three flowers are sitting in the axils of fleshy, opposite bracts. The flowers are bisexual (sometimes the stamens of the lateral flowers mey be missing) and proterandric. The central flower is four-angled, the two lateral flowers are three-angled. The perianth consists of 3‚Äì4 joined tepals usually concrescent to the apex, these are directed upwards and protrude the length of the bracts by up to one-third to one-half. They consist of several layers of parenchymatous, thin-walled cells with some scattered lignified cells, but are never completely indurated. There are 1‚Äì2 stamens exserting the flower, 0.8‚Äì1.3 mm, and a conical ovary with two stigmas. The fruit wall (pericarp) is parenchymatous, thick and few-layered in the upper part and thinning in the lower part. The seed is reddish when unripe, becoming black. The seed coat is crustaceous, mostly with papillose, conic outgrowths along one side. The vertical embryo is curved (comma-shaped). The seed contains copious perisperm (feeding tissue).  Distribution and habitat  Arthrocnemum is widely distributed from the Saharo-Arabian Region of Southwest Asia, the Mediterranean region and northern Sahara, to Macaronesia and western tropical Africa at Cape Verde. (excluding the American Arthrocnemum subterminale, see below). As typical halophytes they grow in coastal salt marshes and on saline inland habitats.  Systematics  The genus Arthrocnemum was first published in 1840 by Alfred Moquin-Tandon. As a type is not yet given, the genus will be typified with a conserved name. Arthrocnemum formerly included several species that are now classified to other genera of the subfamily Salicornioideae (e.g., Sarcocornia, or Tecticornia). The genus proved to be clearly distinct, either via phylogenetic research or by the morphology of its species' fruit. Molecular genetic studies revealed that Arthrocnemum is closely related to the monotypic genus Microcnemum. According to Sukhorukov & Nilova (2016), Arthrocnemum comprises only two species: *Arthrocnemum franzii Sukhor., in western tropical Africa: Cape Verde on the islands Sal, Maio and Boa Vista. *Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moric.) C.Koch, widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, Macaronesia, northern Sahara, and Southwest Asia. *Arthrocnemum subterminale (Parish) Standl., North America: in California and Mexico. This species is morphologically distant from the Eurasian Arthrocnemum and should be excluded from this genus.  References  Peter W. Ball: 'eFloras 2008. Arthrocnemum in Flora of North America.

After his early death the art gallery he had established in central Berlin was taken on by his son, the dealer Wolfgang Gurlitt (1888-1965). Life Friedrich Louis Moritz Anton Gurlitt was born in Vienna. His father, Louis Gurlitt 1812‚Äì1897, was a well regarded landscape artist. The Gurlitts were among the leading families in the nineteenth century arts establishment in the German speaking world, which provided Friedrich with a relatively trouble free admission ticket to the arts community. Friedrich's mother, born Elisabeth Lewald, was of Jewish provenance, which became politically significant only many years later, after a government came to power in Germany that was keen to convert visceral racism into a defining underpinning of government policy. In 1880 he founded the \\"Fritz Gurlitt Gallery\\" in Berlin. The gallery was located at Behrenstra√üe 29 (29 Behren Street), and specialised in contemporary art. Differences have arisen over the correct name of the business, which is identified sometimes as a \\"gallery\\" (\\"Galerie\\"), sometimes as an \\"art dealership\\" (\\"Kunsthandlung\\") and sometimes as an \\"art salon\\" (\\"Kunst-Salon\\"). Artists whom he backed included Arnold B√∂cklin and Anselm Feuerbach. In 1886, he was mandated to take charge of the \\"Jubilee Exhibition\\", described as the \\"first international art exhibition in Berlin\\". The well-regarded novelist Theodor Fontane probably owed much of his knowledge of B√∂cklin to Fritz Gurlitt. Other artists who in large measure owed their reputations to the Gurlitt Gallery include Wilhelm Leibl, Hans Thoma, Max Liebermann, Lesser Ury, Franz Skarbina and Clara Siewert. Fritz Gurlitt died suddenly on 8 February 1893 as a result of the syphilis from which he suffered. In the immediate term, the Fritz Gurlitt Gallery was relocated to an address in the \\"Leipzigerstrasse\\" (\\"Leipzig Street\\"), but in other respects continued to operate as before, apparently under the direction of Carl Steinbart, an art collector and banker who had been a friend of Gurlitt's. In 1907, when Wolfgang Gurlitt, the elder son of Fritz, reached the age of 19, he took on the gallery which retained its focus on contemporary art: there are suggestions that Wolfgang was more commercially astute than his father had been. In the end the gallery closed down, during the Second World War, in 1942. Family Fritz Gurlitt married Annarella Imhoff (1858‚Äì1935) in 1881. Her father was the Swiss sculptor who had by this time lived in Rome, ostensibly on account of his health, for many years. Fritz and Annarella married in Rome. Contemporary sources indicate that the marriage resulted in four recorded children as follows: * Angelina (1882‚Äì1962) who married Sigmund von Weech * Margarete (1885‚Äì?) * Wolfgang (1888‚Äì1965) art dealer * Manfred (1890‚Äì1972) composer, especially of operas, and orchestral conductor After the Nazis took power people were persuaded to investigate their ancestry and \\"demonstrate\\" that none of their four grandparents were Jewish. This was particularly important for anyone with a job in public service and / or a high-profile public position. Manfred Gurlitt had a high profile as an opera conductor whose performances were frequently broadcast on national radio. He joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933. On 4 May 1937 his party membership was nullified on account of his Jewish provenance, presumably on account of his paternal grandmother, Elisabeth Leward/Gurlitt. Information on his Nazi Party connections during the intervening four year is incomplete, but a number of sources from the period indicate that his father was not Fritz Gurlitt but his mother's lover, Willi Waldecker. The idea was not totally preposterous, since Manfred was only 3 when his father died, and his mother did subsequently marry Willi Waldecker. Towards the end of the 1930s Manfred Gurlitt relocated to Japan where he enjoyed a career based in Tokyo as a conductor of western music.

Biography  After he finished his musical studies, first at the Conservatory of Nice then the Conservatoire de Paris, Roger Dumas was conductor during the 1920s and 1930s at the Casino de Toulon (a city where he also taught at the conservatory). It is in this entertainment venue and under his musical direction that his first operetta, Flouette, was created in 1924. The second was Le Danseur du casino, premiered at Orange in 1935. He became film score composer on two productions respectively released in 1930 (Cendrillon de Paris, with Alibert and Pauline Carton) and 1931 (Les Vagabonds magnifiques, with Nadia Sibirska√Øa and Georges Melchior). His third film was Les Bleus de la marine by Maurice Cammage (1934, music cowritten with Vincent Scotto), starring Fernandel and the screenwriter Jean Manse. In association with the latter (the actor's stepbrother) as librettist, he composed his third operetta, Ignace, created in Marseille in 1935, then revived at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin in Paris in 1936, with Fernandel in the leading role, Andrex, Edmond Castel, Alice Tissot and Henry Tr√©voux. This operetta was brought to the screen under the same title, under the direction of Pierre Colombier (1937), where Fernandel, Andrex and Alice Tissot resume their respective roles. There followed a collaboration with Fernandel for twelve other films (to which Jean Manse participated, mostly as lyricist), including Barnab√© by Alexander Esway (1938), Simplet (directed by the actor, 1942) and L'Aventure de Cabassou by Gilles Grangier (1946). Their last feature film together was Uniformes et grandes man≈ìuvres by Ren√© Le H√©naff, released in December 1950, some months before the composer's premature deaths at 53. Dumas also contributed to eight films without Fernandel, including his first two already mentioned, Pierre et Jean by Andr√© Cayatte (1943, with Ren√©e Saint-Cyr and No√´l Roquevert) as well as C√©cile est morte by Maurice Tourneur (1944, with Albert Pr√©jean featuring commissaire Maigret). Roger Dumas' fourth operetta was Un de la musique, created at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin in 1937, with Georges Milton, Louis Florencie and Alice Tissot. The fifth (in partnership with Georges Van Parys for music) was Les Chasseurs d'images, created at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris in 1946, with Fernandel and Ren√© Lestelly. The sixth and last one was La Chance d'Oscar (published in 1949), not represented but of which Fernandel recorded two songs on 78 rpm (published in 1951) - after others before, like Ignace and On m'appelle simplet, song- titles of the pre-mentioned movies - .

Biography Born on 30 June 1923 in Porto San Giorgio, Italy, in 1928 she migrated with her family to Australia because of the political situation in Italy; Nibbi grew up in Melbourne with an English education.Claude Vandersleyen, Alessandra Nibbi - Obituary from the Griffith Institute website In 1947, after the war and the fall of fascism, Nibbi and her family temporarily returned to Italy, and here she got married. In 1963 she came again to Italy and during the journey she joined an excursion in Egypt, where she became fascinated by ancient Egyptian civilization at the point that once in Italy she started to study archaeology at the University of Perugia and later graduated at the University of Florence. Shortly after, Nibbi left Italy for Oxford, England. In 1969 she published the Etruscans-themed The Tyrrhenians, but a certain notoriety only came in 1972 with the self-published The Sea‚ÄìPeoples: A Re-examination of the Egyptian Sources, in which she suggested that \\"the Great Green\\" mentioned in Egyptian records should not be identified with the Mediterranean Sea as usually done but rather with the verdant Nile Delta, and that ancient Egyptians were not as much a seafaring civilization as thought; at the time the book and the conclusions within were widely panned by mainstream academics. Since the journals started to refuse publishing her works, in 1985 Nibbi founded her own review, the still-running Discussions in Egyptology, on which she published her successive studies on ancient Egyptian geography centering on her reinterpretation of some narratives involving seafaring, such as the Story of Wenamun. In order to finding evidences for her claims, Nibbi excavated in various Egyptian coastal locations such as Mersa Matruh looking for anchors and other ancient naval technology. Alessandra Nibbi died on 15 January 2007 in Oxford, aged 83.

She is the third hybrid ferry commissioned and owned by Caledonian Maritime Assets, one of three such ferries in the world to incorporate a low-carbon hybrid system of diesel electric and lithium ion battery power. The ferries are sea-going and are nearly long, accommodating 150 passengers, 23 cars or two HGVs. History Catriona was launched on 11 December 2015 at Ferguson Marine Engineering in Port Glasgow by Mrs Anna √òstergaard, wife of CMAL chairman Erik √òstergaard. Catriona is the first ship to be built at the Ferguson yard following its purchase by Clyde Blowers Capital. The ships in the hybrid fleet are named after Scottish literature. The first, ', entered service on the Sconser to Raasay route in October 2013. The second, ' entered service on the Tarbert to Portavadie route in 2014. Catriona is a novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1893. Catriona was awarded ‚ÄòElectric & Hybrid Propulsion System of the Year‚Äô in 2016. Layout Catriona can accommodate 150 passengers, 23 cars or 2 HGVs. She has a service speed of and is powered by small diesel generator sets, feeding power to a 400-volt switchboard, which supplies power to electric propulsion motors that turn the propulsion units. In addition, two lithium-ion battery banks with a total of 700kWh are also available to supply power to the units. The battery banks will be charged overnight from the mains. It is anticipated that renewable energy sources will be used to charge the batteries in future, further reducing the carbon footprint. Experience has shown that hybrid vessels can reduce fuel consumption by up to 38% compared with a conventionally powered vessel of the same size. This will result in a decrease in CO2 emissions in excess of 5,500 tonnes per vessel over their lifetime, with a similar decrease in sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions. Service CalMac's hybrid ferries are designed to operate on many of the short crossing routes around the Clyde and Hebrides. Catriona displaced on the Claonaig- Lochranza crossing to meet increasing demand on this route in 2016. In June 2017, ' provided additional sailings on the Claonaig-Lochranza route alongside Catriona while ' was away at James Watt Dock for emergency repairs. In January 2018, Catriona was the relief vessel on the Largs-Cumbrae ferry crossing while ' went for overhaul. In March 2019, Catriona operated a shuttle service on the Claonaig-Lochranza crossing after ' sustained damage to her bow visor as a result of ramming the pier at Brodick.

On 6 December 2016, the mastermind of the attack, Jehangir Badini, was killed in Pishin during an operation by security forces. Incident Advocate Bilal Anwar Kasi 46, the president of Balochistan Bar Association, was attacked on the morning of 8 August near Mengal Chowk on Manno Jan Road while leaving his home for his office. His dead body was brought to the Government Hospital for autopsy and many advocates assembled there. A suspected suicide bombing took place inside the hospital, which was followed by gunfire resulting in fatalities and injuries. Police and Frontier Corps took over the area after the attack and an emergency was declared in hospitals of Quetta. Mobile phone jammers were activated in the hospital area. The Bomb Disposal Squad reported that 8 to 9 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack. Two journalists, one from Aaj News and the other from Dawn News, died in the Quetta Civil Hospital attack while working. =Perpetrators= Both the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) have claimed responsibility for the attack. Initially Islamic State claimed the responsibility for the attack stating that ‚ÄúA martyr from the Islamic State detonated his explosive belt at a gathering of justice ministry employees and Pakistani policemen in the city of Quetta.‚Äù. However, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a splinter group of Pakistani militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, also claimed credit for the attack on advocate Kasi and the hospital. The group threatened that more attacks would take place \\"until the imposition of an Islamic system in Pakistan\\". ISPR quoted Army Chief Raheel Sharif as saying that the attack was targeting China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).  Reactions  = Domestic = Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Mamnoon Hussain condemned the attack and expressed their grief over the loss.

Several politicians, including Balochistan Chief Minister Sanaullah Zehri, Interior Minister Minister Sarfraz Bugti, former president Pervez Musharraf, National Security adviser Sartaj Aziz and Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria accused the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Afghanistan's intelligence agency National Directorate of Security (NDS) of orchestrating the attack. The accusations reiterated past Pakistani claims of Indian involvement in Balochistan. Pakistan's military establishment said that the threat to internal security was morphing due to a nexus between hostile foreign intelligence agencies and local militant groups. However, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Muhammad Khan Sherani and Leader of opposition in Pakistani Senate, Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan alleged that the government was trying to save itself from any responsibility by blaming foreign agencies and contending that it was a failure of Pakistani Intelligence Agencies demanded sacking of officials if perpetrators are not caught. Provincial government announced compensation of Rs 10 million for deceased person's family and Rs 5 million for seriously injured. Medical expenses and associated charges of those admitted in Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Quetta and Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi will be compensated by Government. According to the victims Government is not doing enough for their care. Punjab chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, gave Rs 0.5 Million for the deceased and Rs 250,000 for injured. Education Fund was established by Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Sanaullah Zehri for the children of the victims. = International = United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, United States White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and French President Fran√ßois Hollande all condemned the attack.

The project utilizes the devices of Eco Wave Power Ltd, an Israel-based wave energy company. The wave farm was initially launched with an estimated peak capacity of 100 kW in April 2016 and plans for expansion to 5 MW within the next years. The project is operating through a 25-year PPA (power purchase agreement) between Eco Wave Power, the Government of Gibraltar, and the Gibraltar Electricity Authority. Upon completion, it is expected generate 15% of the total electricity consumption of Gibraltar. The project is funded, in part, by the 2014-2020 European Regional Development Fund, in order to put the country in line with the EU's renewable energy goal: 20% energy generated from renewable power by 2020. The project is also funded by private investment groups. As of February 2018, the Gibraltar Wave Farm accrued 15,000 grid connected hours (and counting), a new world record for wave energy plant. Opening ceremony Co-founders David Leb and Inna Braverman stand with Chief Minister Fabian Picardo and Minister for Health, the Environment, and Climate Change John Cortes. The opening ceremony took place on May 26, 2016. Chief Minister Fabian Picardo cut the ribbon, and stated to GBC press, \\"At last we are seeing the grid fed with renewable energy, something that was long overdue ...But it's even more exciting than that. This is the first time, in the whole of Europe, that a renewable wave energy system is linked into an electricity grid. The Gibraltarians are here pioneers in our partnership with Eco Wave Power...\\" Minister of Health, The Environment, and Climate Change Dr. John Cortes confirmed the technology, \\"This is clearly working. I think that the future is bright and the future, like the past all those 6 million years ago, is in the power of the sea all around us.\\" Gibraltar's Director of European Programmes, Charles Collinson, stated, \\"...And I hope that we are able to collaborate in future expansion of this project.\\" Technical description Converter consists of three main functional parts: mechanical, hydraulic and electric systems. Mechanical system serves for wave energy receipt on floaters and its transmission to hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulic system transforms mechanical energy from the sea to hydraulic fluid pressure and to force of hydraulic motor rotation, which transfers moment of rotation to generator. Generator is part of converter electrical system. It receives moment of rotation and transforms it to electrical power. \\" Gallery File:Gibraltar Ammunition Jetty Tunnels.jpg|The power station is located inside the prior World War II ammunition jetty tunnels.

In addition to covering local and national news stories by local reporters, the Mercury carried syndicated content from other papers. This included poetry and in 1840 published two to four poems in each weekly edition. Extensive coverage was also given to social issues of the time.

Stadium‚Äôs history  The stadium was built in 1929, after the municipality of Solingen assigned unemployed men to built the stadium. In 1933 VfR Ohligs moved to the stadium. During the 2nd World War the stadium was badly damaged and reconstruction took place in 1949 and 1950. In 1949 VfR Ohligs merged with other clubs to SC Union 06. The renovated stadium was opened in 1950, in front of a crowd of 10,000 spectators. In 1973 SC Union 06 merged with another club into SG Union Solingen. The new club promoted in 1975 to the 2.

In 1985 an estimated crowd of 18,000 to 20,000 people visited the DFB Pokal match against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. It appeared however, that the club couldn‚Äôt survive financially in the 2.

Due to safety reasons, the stadium‚Äôs capacity was reduced in 2005 to 5,000. In 2010 1. FC Union Solingen went bankrupt and since 2010 no tenant plays at the stadium anymore.

Born on 31 July 1926, and raised in Timaru, Donnithorne was the son of hotelkeepers. Following World War II he studied architecture by correspondence in the \\"Christchurch Atelier\\"', instead of travelling to the only architecture school in New Zealand at that time in Auckland. His student contemporaries included Miles Warren and Peter Beaven, and the three would go on to become the most significant figures in Christchurch architecture of the second half of the 20th century, producing works with clean, modernist lines. However, unlike Warren and Maurice Mahoney, who were strongly influenced by brutalism, Donnithorne followed Scandinavian cues in his work. One of Donnithorne's earliest designs was for the Evangelistic Temple, at the corner of Colombo Street and Moorhouse Avenue in Christchurch. His later works included the Wigram Air Force Museum, the Netball Centre in Hagley Park, and the Millbrook Apartments in Carlton Mill Road.
