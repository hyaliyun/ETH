Alfredson's paintings do not fall into a single category but instead cross over and combine Surrealism and Magic Realism as well as Symbolist and Fantastic art; a strong emphasis on classical painting technique is a major feature of the artist's work. Alfredson is a \\"Pansurrealist\\" according to Terrance Lindall in his essay What's New in the Surreal World? Lindall makes the point that contemporary artists whose works evolve out of the subconscious and the dream state form a type of new surrealism. According to Lindall, this new form of surrealism is more diversified when compared to the original Surrealist movement, but Pansurrealist artists such as Alfredson continue to depend on the subconscious as the foundation for artworks that are surreal and visionary. Early life and education Alfredson was born in √ñrebro, Sweden, to a Finnish mother and a Swedish father. Early in life, Alfredson's parents recognized their young son's talent and, after Alfredson announced at age seven that he would become an artist, his father taught the young boy the basics of oil painting.Andersson, Yngve, (29 March 2003),\\"A Magical Realist\\" translated from Blekinge L√§nsTidning Magazine. In his early teens, Alfredson was submitting caricatures and cartoons to Swedish newspapers and magazines; the Swedish edition of Mad Magazine was one of the first to publish Alfredson's images. Sixteen-year-old Alfredson first exhibited his work professionally in a group show in S√∂lvesborg at Nicolaig√•rden. The same year, he left home to attend Fetco's School of Fine Arts (now Konstskolan i Stockholm) and later took advanced classes in formal painting at Pernby's M√•larskola in Stockholm. Early career In 1980, Alfredson sold his first painting UFO Sverige Aktuellt to a Swedish magazine; it subsequently was shown at an exhibition of UFO artwork in the K√∂pings Museum; the commissioned work depicted a UFO in the sky with two aliens standing below. During the 1980s, Alfredson lived, worked, and exhibited in Stockholm, participating in several art shows including Stockholm's Fria Konstmassa (Stockholm's Free Art Fair), juried by radio producer Peter R. Meyer. His work was also exhibited at Svarta M√•nen (Black Moon), a bookstore and arts center that featured concerts and poetry readings that were broadcast from an in-house radio station. From 1985 to 1987, Alfredson organized and catalogued artworks for Liljevalchs Konsthall, one of Stockholm's contemporary art museums. = Arrival in New York = Alfredson arrived in New York City in 1995 with a solo exhibition at the Limner Gallery in SoHo. Within a few months, the artist had earned the title \\"The darling of the New York underground scene\\" with artwork in twenty shows during the first year after his arrival. Alfredson's art career was given a boost in 1998 when Thelma Golden of the Whitney Museum curated one of his pieces into the juried show \\"Art as Spectacle\\" at the Katonah Museum. The exhibition, labeled the year's \\"most prestigious\\" by the New York Times, was considered a tri-state event. During the same year, while exhibiting in a gallery in Brooklyn, Alfredson met photographer Mia Hanson who later became his wife. In 1998, the couple lived and worked first in California, then in Stockholm, and in 2001 returned to Manhattan to take up residence in the Hotel Chelsea. = Living and painting in the Hotel Chelsea = For the next decade, Alfredson and his wife lived in New York's Chelsea Hotel where Alfredson produced and displayed as many as fifty pieces at a time in the hotel's stairwell and hallways. While being interviewed by Abel Ferrara in the documentary \\"Chelsea on the Rocks,\\" Alfredson told of a hotel resident who had a psychotic break and slashed several of Hawk's paintings. Alfredson said he had no animosity toward the man, stating the documentary's memorable words, \\"We all have our scars . . .he gave my paintings a couple of scars.\\" Hawk and his wife appeared on part of the \\"Hotel Secrets\\" series that marked the restructuring of the Hotel Chelsea and removal of the artistic element. The couple left in 2010 along with other long-time residents. Artwork Since Alfredson's work often depicts images taken from \\"the strange visionary periods between sleeping and waking,\\" the artist is associated with the Pansurrealism movement. His use of many motifs imbued with mystical symbolism also places his work into several categories such as Magic Realism and Symbolist Art. Alfredson works almost exclusively with oil paints, using detailed brushwork, multiple layers of glazing, and a northern European palette‚Äîclassically rendering images with an emphasis on craftsmanship and composition. Dream-like environments and people form the basis of his representational work, with symbols and detailed patterns‚Äî\\"circlings\\" and complex Fibonacci spiral motifs‚Äîdominant in the non- objective paintings. Although Alfredson's artwork displays a variety of motifs and themes, many of the images can be loosely grouped into five major categories: frontal portraits such as those found in the Dream Ambassador series; solitary standing or floating figures often surrounded by mystical objects and symbols; large \\"swarm paintings\\" which show nightmarish, chaotic scenes; inorganic and organic objects with otherworldly, numinous qualities; and abstract paintings depicting spirals, circlings, and complex patterns. Representative samples of the five categories include: *Icon for an Unknown Religion (frontal portraits) *Stebuklingas Drugelis (the upright figure series) *Tight Antic II (the chaos series) *Nostradamus' Last Words I (the mystical objects series) *Blue World Circlings aka Blue World, (symbolic nonobjective category) During an interview in a New York gallery Hawk stated, \\"I want to transport the viewer into an altered state of consciousness. . . perceiving the images filtered through their own reality.\\"  Influences  When in art school in Stockholm, Hawk Alfredson was greatly influenced by the artwork of surrealists Salvador Dal√≠ and Ren√© Magritte; Alfredson considers some of Dali's work remains \\"fascinating on many levels\\" but has not remained a major influence. Old Masters who influenced Alfredson's early artistic development include Johannes Vermeer, Jan van Eyck, and Georges de La Tour. Alfredson's artwork also shows the influence of Swiss Symbolist painter Arnold B√∂cklin. Of contemporary artists, Alfredson identifies Odd Nerdrum as having had a deep and lasting impact: \\"I think he's one of the best living artists on this planet.\\" Alfredson readily acknowledges the early influence of historical figures such as Visionary artists Hieronymus Bosch and William Blake or Symbolist artists Karel V√≠tƒõzslav Ma≈°ek and Edvard Munch. When in his early 20s, Alfredson came upon a painting by Alberto Giacometti and \\"it truly mesmerized me and put me in a dreamlike, hypnotic state of mind where time and space disappeared. The films of Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Alain Resnais, and Carl Theodor Dreyer also helped strengthen the emerging artist's vision. Written works such as Gustav Meyrink's The Golem as well as hallucinatory stories of Carolos Castaneda, Zoran Zivkovic, and Hector Gramme have influenced Alfredson's artistic vision.

J. \\"Skid\\" Simon (190448), first published in 1945. It contains practical advice directed mainly towards rubber bridge players, and introduces to the world four stereotypical bad players: Mr Smug, the Unlucky Expert, Mrs Guggenheim, and Futile Willie. It has been much admired by duplicate bridge players as well as by rubber bridge players, and Simon's fictional characters have passed into legend. Cut for Partners, another book by Simon, recounts the further misadventures of his four fictional players. It was published posthumously in 1950.  Why You Lose at Bridge  = Introduction = Simon dedicated the book to the memory of Richard Lederer, his friend and fellow bridge expert. \\"Portrait\\" (Simon's title for his preface to his book) exemplifies his style of writing: According to Simon, the two primary reasons for losing at bridge are (a) lack of technical skill and (b) losing tactics. Simon claims to address the latter alone, but that is not entirely true: for example, Chapters II and III include sound technical advice on cardplay. = Summary of contents = The book consists of 12 chapters: I \\"The Points You Lose 'Ignoring the Odds'\\", II \\"The Points You Lose Playing the Dummy\\", III \\"The Points You Lose in Defence\\", IV \\"The Points You Lose 'Bidding'\\", V \\"The Points You Lose NOT Doubling\\", VI \\"Your Battlefield\\", VII \\"Don't Teach Your Partner\\", VIII \\"Half a Loaf\\", IX \\"They Can't Fool Me!\\", X \\"Fixed - By Palookas!\\", XI \\"The Logic of Luck\\", and XII \\"A Rubber at the Club\\". Chapters I-IV relate mainly to technical aspects of bidding and play. They include some of Simon's better-known aphorisms Chapter V discusses the penalty double; whose theory is, according to Simon, the least understood theory in Contract Bridge. In Chapters VI-VIII, Simon turns to the practicalities of cut-in rubber bridge played for money. The title of Chapter VIII alludes to the English proverb \\"Half a loaf is better than no bread\\". The professional rubber bridge player aims for: Chapters IX and X relate to how to counter preemptive and psychic bidding; and to when and to when not to use such tactics yourself. Chapter XI is concerned with the effect which good and bad runs of cards might have on a professional money bridge player's confidence and skill. In Chapter XII, Simon brings together, and completes, his quartet of fictional bridge players for: = A Rubber at the Club = In this, the concluding part of Why You Lose at Bridge, Simon describes and analyses a rubber played by his four fictional players: Mr Smug, the Unlucky Expert, Mrs Guggenheim, and Futile Willie. The rubber consists of nine deals, all from actual play. Each deal is shown in full; followed by the auction, with Simon's comments; a narrative description of the play; the players' post mortem, with interjections by Simon; and his calculation of the number of total points chucked away. Every hand exhibits various kinds and degrees of ineptitude; except that in the final one, the Unlucky Expert skilfully executes a dummy reversal and squeeze once played at the table by Jack Marx. The result is a washout: a trivial difference in score, with no winners and no losers. Simon then rapidly demonstrates how an \\"ordinary, sound, common-sense player\\" would have won a 9-, 12-, 14- or 20-point rubber.In England, rubber bridge is played for a fixed stake per hundred points difference between the total point scores of the two sides, rounding scores of 1040 down and of 5090 up to the nearest hundred. Each such hundred is a \\"point\\" for scoring purposes; for example, a score difference of 850940 total points would be a nine point, or nine hundred point,  Cut for Partners  Simon's book Cut for Partners is in effect a continuation of the chapter \\"A Rubber at the Club\\" in his book Why You Lose at Bridge. It has an Introduction by Terence Reese. The same four fictional characters play three more rubbers (34 deals). No-one ever wants to cut in at their table. Their bidding and play are both believable and ineffective; except that the Unlucky Expert does exhibit his card-playing skill, including one brilliancy. Two deals later, Futile Willie attempts the same brilliancy, on the wrong hand; and it backfires, badly. As before, each deal and auction is shown in full, with Simon's comments; followed by a narrative description of the play and its aftermath; and finally a brief analysis of the result.  Critical reception and legacy  Why You Lose at Bridge has rarely been out of print. Although it is primarily concerned with rubber bridge, it has been much admired by duplicate bridge players for its relevance to that form of the game also. * 1967The Bridge Players' Encyclopedia: a \\"classic\\", a book which made \\"a major contribution to the technical development of the game\\", and an \\"optional requirement for a modern technical bridge library\\". * 1977Terence Reese: \\"S.

Influenced by family members and Southern black gospel traditions, the ensemble recorded 18 singles during the peak of their popularity in the 1940s under the leadership of singer-songwriter Lander Coleman. In their heyday, the Coleman Brothers were a pioneering presence on music radio and received extended notice when their song \\"Milky White Way\\" was covered by the Trumpeteers to huge commercial success.  History  The nucleus of the Coleman Brothers came together, at least in rudimentary form, in 1932. All musicians in the group had a background rooted in spiritual and jubilee traditions, with each one singing, some independently of one another, in churches and concert programs. In addition, an earlier ensemble consisting of an older generation of Coleman family members performed throughout New Jersey under the same name between 1917 and 1925 but never recorded. The line- up was in a constant state of instability in the early years of its existence until brothers Lander (lead vocals), Russell (tenor), Wallace (baritone), Melvin (bass) and Everitte Coleman (guitar), as well as Danny Owens (second tenor), came together in 1935. Between 1935 and 1942, the Coleman Brothers were popular figures in package tours across the American south and west, appearing recurrently with the Soul Stirrers and the Dixie Hummingbirds. The group also spent time singing on radio programs WHBI, WPAT, and WABC before receiving a vocal staff contract with CBS in New York in 1943. There, the group sponsored major companies, becoming one of the first black ensembles to do so when they promoted the Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company on national television. As the Coleman Brothers broadcast an early morning programme for CBS, their manager Milt Lasnick arranged a one-off single deal with Decca Records. The record coupled cover versions of \\"Low Down Chariot\\" and \\"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\\". More recordings were released by Manor Records, including Coleman's \\"Milky White Way\\", a song that became an enormous hit for the Trumpeteers in 1948. The brothers became so popular that they established a business enterprise which included a record label (Coleman Records), a lodge, a hotel in Newark, and a collection of barbecue restaurants. Their label released six singles by the Coleman Brothers, among other acts, and had a national hit with the Ray-O-Vacs whose take on the song \\"I'll Always Be in Love with You\\" reached number eight on the Billboard R&B; Charts. To direct the rapidly expanding venture, Melvin Coleman left the group to become the business's full-time president, and was replaced by A.J. Eldridge. By 1946, the group moved to Cincinnati to work for WLW, the same station that launched the Mills Brothers' career. In 1951, the Coleman Brothers disbanded after recording three singles for Regal Records a year earlier. For a while, Lander Coleman managed a club in Newark before forming a new Coleman Brothers group in 1964 and recording a studio album, titled Milky White Way to capitalize on the rendition done by Elvis Presley. Coleman continued to perform with the quartet until two of its members were wounded in a robbery in 1978. The Coleman label, supervised by Melvin Coleman, was sold to Savoy Records after his death in 1959.

After World War II it remained in use aboard the patrol boats of the Guardia di Finanza. History The Breda Model 31 was a license built copy of the French Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun. Breda acquired a production license in 1929, but it did not enter production until 1931. The Model 31 was often mounted on single and twin mounts aboard surface ships and on a disappearing twin mount aboard submarines. The Model 31 was intended to provide close-range air defense, but like its counterparts in other nations, these small-caliber guns were found incapable of defending against low-level torpedo-bombers or high altitude level-bomber attacks because their bullets were too light and short ranged. Although a reliable gun with good performance, it was later replaced by the Breda 20/65 Mod. 1935. Construction The Model 31 was a gas-operated, air-cooled machine gun with a tilting bolt action.

She is known for work that depicts South Asian women openly displaying body hair. Biography Khan is a first-generation Pakistani-American who was born and raised in New York City. She identifies as Muslim. Raised in a predominantly white area, Khan felt pressure to fit in with her peers and described herself in a 2018 interview with Allure as \\"somebody who had to prepare two hours to wake up early to make sure I had no hair on my face.\\" She continued removing unwanted hair until college. Between 2016 and 2017 she stopped removing any body hair at all and struggled with the reactions of the general public and her family. After beginning to reject societal expectations about body hair for herself, she began painting artwork featuring women with facial and body hair. As of 2020, Khan is a student at Cooper Union, and was selected to participate in a study abroad program at Central Saint Martins. Career Khan's work features traditional South Asian motifs and symbols of American youth culture and focuses on brown women with visible body hair they have decided not to remove. The women are often seen in casual, personal or social settings because, as she explained in a 2016 interview, \\"body hair is a natural thing and so it makes sense for me to want to project it into my drawings of people.\\" Lia McGarrigle argued that the appeal of Khan's work is tied to how it challenges the inherent shame of traditional beauty standards toward body hair. Khan uses Tumblr and Instagram to connect and engage with her audience. In a 2016 profile, WNYC's Studio 360 explained her online presence has been well received by young women who identify with the imagery she creates and who have, in turn, confided their own stories of navigating two cultural experiences. Creators echoed that sentiment explaining that she has created spaces for people to discuss and share their own relationships and experiences with body hair. In 2017 Khan contributed art for one of a series of Mother's Day greeting cards created by the California nonprofit Forward Together that aimed to promote awareness about different types of motherhood. Her piece depicted a mother on a Pakistani rug next to a saucer of tea, embracing her gender ambiguous child. Khan is the founder of SouthAsia.Art, an online collective that promotes the work of South Asian artists.

Dyson has been publicly bullish on the technology, and has stated that it is ‚Äúcommitted to investing ¬£1bn in battery technology over the coming years, and Sakti3 is an essential and exciting part of that program.‚Äù  History  Sakti3 is a battery company co-founded by Dr. Ann Marie Sastry, Dr. Chia-Wei Wang and Dr. Fabio Albano, regarded as globally influential battery technology innovators, in 2007 as a spin-out from University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Publications by Sastry and her collaborators have been cited over 6,400 times. She and her two former students Dr. Chi-Wei Wand and Dr. Fabio Albano formed the company, hence the number \\"3\\" in the name; most have remained at the firm, according to a recently granted patent.United States Patent 9,627,709 Work by this group, including Dr. Chia-Wei Wang, Dr. Fabio Albano, Dr. Yen-Hung Chen, Dr. Xiangchun Zhang, Dr. Myoungdo Chung, and Dr. HyonCheol Kim, has been cited extensively (collectively over 4100 times). As reported in Scientific American, Sakti3 claimed to achieve 1143 Wh/L in volumetric energy density in its prototype solid-state lithium battery cells in 2014. In 2015, Sakti3 was invited to the first ever White House Demo Day by President Barack Obama to showcase its innovations. In 2015, Sakti3 was acquired by Dyson Ltd. They initially paid $15m for an undisclosed stake, this being Dyson's first outside investment. Later in the year, Dyson paid another $90m for the rest of Sakti3. Other investors had included Beringea, General Motors, Khosla Ventures and Itochu.  Technology  Sakti3 has described methods for producing scalable solid-state batteries, using thin film deposition guided by numerical simulations and optimization and apparently used multiple deposition techniques.United States Patents 9,127,344 and 9,240,584 Sakti3 has been recognized with several technical awards, including MIT Technology Review's Top 50 Most Disruptive Companies in 2012, and MIT Technology Review's 50 Smartest Companies in 2015. In 2014, Sakti3 is named by Crain‚Äôs Detroit Business as one of its Most Innovative Companies for its patents on ‚Äúmethods for manufacturing batteries, a solid-state propulsion system and automotive hybrid technology.‚Äù Sakti3 has grown its intellectual property portfolio to 94 patents and patents pending. In 2017, it abandoned its licenses of its early University of Michigan patents.  Workplace Culture  Sakti3 has been recognized multiple times for excellence in workplace culture. Sakti3 has won the AWE Workplace Excellence Seal of Approval Award for its for ‚Äúexemplary commitment to building excellent places to work‚Äù in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Sakti3 has been named 101 Best and Brightest Companies to Work For in 2015 and 2016 for its ‚Äúcommitment to excellence in their human resource practices and employee enrichment.‚Äù Sakti3 was also awarded Crain‚Äôs Detroit Cool Places to Work in Michigan in 2016.  Criticism  Sakti3 has been criticized for its secretive nature, a trait it apparently shares with its acquirer. Dyson takes great measures to protect its technology and is ‚Äúas secretive‚Äù as Apple. During a tour of Dyson‚Äôs facilities, a New York Times reporter observed that ‚Äúemployees remain tight-lipped, even among themselves, about their projects;‚Äù ‚Äúprototypes were covered in tarps while large areas of the open-plan offices were off limits;‚Äù and ‚Äúmachinery in some of the research labs was obscured with black trash bags.‚Äù Claims made by the company over technological advances as well as its secretive behavior regarding sharing data have been criticized by former employees and media following the acquisition by Dyson. The only independently verified data on Sakti3's prototypes by the United States Department of Energy show a capacity of 2.4 mAh, only capable of powering very small devices. Steve Buckingham, a former employee, has publicly expressed his disappointment with the small area (1 cm¬≤) of the best cell produced. Bob Kruse, formerly GM's most senior electric vehicle executive, stayed on as COO for less than 2 years. In November 2017 Ann Marie Sastry, Sakti3's founder, unexpected and quiet exit from the company stoked speculation that the company oversold their early successes.  Speculation  In an interview by Car and Driver in 2015, when asked the readiness of Sakti3‚Äôs batteries for automotive applications, Dr. Ann Marie Sastry responded that Sakti3 would first go to markets where their batteries can meet regulatory standards for the products and pointed out that durability standards for batteries in automotive applications are very different from phones or vacuums. The company has been praised for staying afloat and ultimately being acquired in a well-documented acquisition, amidst an intense period of bankruptcies in cleantech. It has been pointed out that it takes a decade to invent a new hardware technology, and more than another decade for the invention to reach the hands of consumers. It took James Dyson 15 years and 5,127 attempts to perfect his flagship vacuum.

Jumbo Comics was Fiction House's first comics title; the publisher had previously specialized in pulp magazines. The lead feature for Jumbo Comics' entire run was Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Notable creators who worked on Jumbo Comics include Jack Kirby (working under a variety of pseudonyms), Bob Kane, Matt Baker, Mort Meskin, Lou Fine, Bob Powell, Mort Leav, Art Saaf, Dick Briefer, Lily Ren√©e, and Ruth Roche. Jerry Iger was Jumbo Comics' art director for its entire run.  Publication history  By the late 1930s, Fiction House publisher Thurman T. Scott expanded the company from pulp magazines to comic books, an emerging medium that began to seem a viable adjunct to the fading pulps. Receptive to a sales call by Eisner & Iger, one of the prominent \\"packagers\\" of that time that produced complete comic books on demand for publishers looking to enter the field, Scott published Jumbo Comics #1 (Sept. 1938) under Fiction House's Real Adventures Publishing Company imprint.Real Adventures Publishing Co., Inc., Grand Comics Database. Accessed Mar. 10, 2017. Sheena, Queen of the Jungle appeared in that initial issue. The character had debuted in 1937 in the British magazine Wags.Sheena, Queen of the Jungle at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original November 10, 2011 Indeed, all the material Eisner & Iger prepared for Jumbo Comics #1 (and the subsequent seven issues) had originally appeared in Wags, which was a tabloid-sized publication. For this reason, Jumbo Comics #1-8 were oversize (10-1/2\\" x 14-1/2\\") and exclusively in black and white.

Bob Powell's first published comic-book art is tentatively identified as the uncredited three- page story \\"A Letter of Introduction,\\" featuring the famed ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, in Jumbo Comics #2 (Oct. 1938). Lou Fine's first published comics art was the strip \\"Wilton of the West\\" in Jumbo Comics #4 (Dec. 1938), signed with the house pen name \\"Fred Sande\\" (which strip originator Jack Kirby had used in previous issues). Ultimately, Fiction House published 167 issues of Jumbo Comics from September 1938‚ÄìMarch 1953.  Recurring features  Three features in Jumbo Comics #1 representing Jack Kirby's first comic-book work following his debut in Wild Boy Magazine:Per Kirby's recollection in interview, The Nostalgia Journal #30 (Nov. 1976), reprinted in The Comics Journal Library, Volume One: Jack Kirby (2002) , p. 3 * \\"The Diary of Dr. Hayward\\" ‚Äî science fiction strip under the pseudonym \\"Curt Davis\\"; the strip was later continued by other artists until issue #9 * \\"Wilton of the West\\" ‚Äî modern-West crimefighter strip as \\"Fred Sande\\"; the strip was later continued by other artists until c. issue #24 * Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo ‚Äî serialized adaptation as \\"Jack Curtiss\\" In addition, Dick Briefer produced a serialized adaptation (in five-page installments) of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame which ran in the first 8 issues.

History Mitford was born at St Pancras, London, the third of four sons of barrister John Mitford (1772‚Äì1851) of the celebrated Mitford family, and his wife Sarah Mitford n√©e Woodward (1784‚Äì1836); his grandparents were the historian William Mitford (1743‚Äì1827) and his first wife Frances \\"Fanny\\" Mitford n√©e Molloy ( ‚Äì1776). He joined the Royal Navy at an early age, and before long transferred to the Spanish service, and may have subsequently served in the British Army, but no details are available; it seems Mitford though voluble about much else, was reticent about his personal history. Mitford and his small family emigrated to South Australia, arriving aboard Katherine Stewart Forbes (Capt. Alfred Fell) in March 1839 after a long voyage of around 150 days. South Australia's future first Chief Justice, Charles Cooper, was a fellow passenger. Mitford purchased a farming property of Section 114, Marion Road near the site of the present Ascot Park school. John Crozier's \\"Oaklands\\" selection was nearby, as was Section 115 of Dr Handasyde Duncan, a fellow passenger on the Katherine Stewart Forbes. Sections 114 and 115 now comprise the suburb of Park Holme. Despite augmenting his farm income by driving a bullock team between Port Adelaide and Burra, the farming venture was not a success, and after fifteen years' toil he sold up and moved to a house on South Road, Edwardstown. He tried his hand as a miner, which turned out to be a mistake. The Tiparra and Bald Hills survey prospects in which he invested proved worthless. He claimed to have been cheated of his rights to the Moonta copper discoveries. He had been, under the nom de plume of \\"Pasquin\\", publishing forthright letters to the Telegraph advocating freedom of communication and removal of Government controls on business, and had built up a following, impressed with his liberal views and idiosyncratic writing. On 26 January 1867 the first issue of his Pasquin: Pastoral, Mineral & Agricultural Advocate appeared, price 4d. (four pence, perhaps $10 in today's values) or by subscription at 4s. (four shillings) per quarter, published by Mitford and Henry Hutchings. Mitford served as editor, lead writer and caricaturist. His vigorous, infuriating, cantankerous and aggressive but entertaining prose achieved immediate recognition and a degree of financial success. :\\"A new weekly newspaper is to be published in Adelaide on and after tomorrow morrow, the editorship of Pasquin, whose clever satirical writings in the Telegraph were very popular.\\" ‚Äî Kapunda Herald 25 January 1867 :\\"Pasquin is an amusing fellow, but his writing is only likely to be relished by the intellectual portion of the community, and we rather fear he will not find his literary bantlingbantling : derogatory term for a young boy; a brat, bastard. a paying speculation.\\" ‚Äî Wallaroo Times 30 January 1867 :\\"Whether people will care to pay for it at the rate of fourpence for eight quarto pages Pasquin will of course soon find out.\\" ‚Äî Southern Argus 2 February 1867 In June 1867 his printer, Samuel E.

It was short-lived however, as two years later while suffering from a cold, Mitford suffered a sudden relapse and died. The paper did not long outlive him; its last issue was published on the last day of 1870. > We regret to see the announcement in the daily papers that this weekly > journal of fun ceased to exist on the 31st ultimo.

Gurley said he was running for office so that a lifelong District resident would be in charge of the District's government. Gurley advocated for improvements to the District's prison system and housing department, and he said that Mayor Barry's leadership was \\"decaying\\". The District of Columbia Office of Business and Economic Development opened a neighborhood revitalization office in Anacostia, in order to give low-interest loans to small businesses for upgrades to the business' outside appearance.Jackson, Kirk. \\"Third Neighborhood Revitalization Office Opens\\". Washington Informer. May 21, 1986. p. 7. Gurley described the office as \\"a solution in search of a problem\\".

The Washington Post. August 20, 1986. p. C3. Gurley criticized Barry for sending his son to a private school. Gurley noted that public schooling was suitable for President Jimmy Carter's daughter but not for Barry's son. Gurley suggested that Barry would increase funding for public schools if his own son were attending them. Gurley said he would voluntarily take a drug test and challenged Barry to do the same. Gurley said the most serious problem facing the District was that federal authorities had taken control of certain functions of the government of the District of Columbia due to mismanagement, resulting in what Gurley called \\"the loss of home rule\\".\\"District of Columbia Voters' Guide\\". The Washington Post. September 4, 1986. p. VG2. Gurley said that the District had not improved at all during the previous four years, with the exception of downtown.

Gurley's campaign chairman, Doug McLellan, called the event a \\"staged event\\" and accused Barry's campaign of packing the meeting with his supporters. The president of the group said the straw vote was legitimate because it was publicized widely and that Gurley lost the straw vote because his campaign did not have much visibility around the ward. At meeting of the Ward 4 Democrats, the results of the straw vote were 95 percent for Barry, 4 percent for Taylor, and 1 percent for Gurley.

Bucklin (1828‚Äì1902, in other sources listed as \\"Sophronia Brecklin\\") was a nurse during the American Civil War. From Auburn, New York, Bucklin served for almost three years of the American Civil War. She worked with numerous hospitals and was present at many notable battles throughout the latter half of the war, until General Lee's surrender. Bucklin was devoted to the war effort, and though dependent on wages for her own living, felt the \\"same patriotism\\" as male volunteers.  Civil War service  At the outbreak of the war, Bucklin was in her late 20s to early 30s, living independently as a seamstress in Auburn, New York. She enlisted her services for the Union effort, and left for the front on September 17, 1862 unaccompanied. As one of the many women serving under Dorothea Dix, Bucklin's service began at the Judiciary Hospital. A mere three months later, she was transferred to a Baptist church to take care of a nurse who had become ill. Bucklin's most notable service, however, took place when she was moved to a point lookout at Chesapeake Bay for the winter. Here, she cared for men fighting at the battles of Antietam, Bull Run, and Fredericksburg. In March, Bucklin moved again to Alexandria, Virginia, and then went on to serve at Gettysburg as a field nurse. She recounts in a letter to Mary G. Holland that she was among the first to arrive at Gettysburg and one of the last to leave. Upon her arrival, Bucklin was faced with a line of soldiers awaiting surgery a mile and a half long. At the completion of Gettysburg, Bucklin spent the next seven or eight months nearby at Stoneman's Cavalry Hospital near Washington, D.C. In the winter of 1863, Bucklin came down with a fever. Her illness proved to be quite extensive, and in her aforementioned letter to Holland she writes that the other hospital staff left her for dead.

[2001] Federal Judicial Scholarship 11. Over time it took on more matters and its judges were allocated a wide range of judicial tasks until it was replaced in 1977 by the Federal Court of Australia which had a more general jurisdiction covering matters arising under Australian federal law. Background From 1904 until 1956 the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration had exercised both arbitration functions, hearing and settling interstate industrial disputes by making awards,Pursuant to the (xxxv). and judicial functions such as interpreting and enforcing those awards. In the Boilermaker's case,. Affirmed on appeal ; . the High Court held that a tribunal could not create new rights such as making an award, the arbitration function, and enforce those rights, the judicial function, due to the separation of powers in the Australian Constitution. The functions of the court were split, with the judicial functions being given to the newly created Commonwealth Industrial Court and the arbitration functions being given to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1956 (Cth) File:Icons-mini-file_acrobat.gif (PDF). The six remaining judges, Sir Raymond Kelly, the Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, died on 25 July 1956. were similarly split with two judges, Edward Dunphy and Sir Edward Morgan, being appointed to the Commonwealth Industrial Court and four, Sir Richard Kirby, Alfred Foster, Sydney Wright and Richard Ashburner being appointed to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Establishment and operation The Australian Government challenged the High Court's decision in the Boilermaker's case and obtained special leave to appeal to the Privy Council on 1 June 1956. The Australian parliament did not wait for the outcome of the appeal, passing the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which received assent on 30 June 1956. The court was formally established on 15 August 1956 and then Attorney-General John Spicer was appointed the first, and as it transpired, only, Chief Judge. Judges of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration had previously been appointed to act in various courts,George Dethridge and Lionel Lukin had been appointed to the Federal Court of Bankruptcy while Dethridge and Harold Piper had been appointed to the Supreme Court (ACT). This practice continued with appointments to the supreme courts of the Australian Capital Territory,All judges with the exception of Chief Judge Sir John Spicer. Christmas,Edward Dunphy. Cocos (Keeling), & Norfolk Islands.Sir Richard Eggleston, Sir Percy Joske, Edward Dunphy, Robert St John and Phillip Evatt. Sir John Spicer was appointed to the first Royal Commission into the collision between HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager, and inquiries into the aviation crashes of TAA Flight 538 (1960), Ansett-ANA Flight 325 (1961) and Ansett-ANA Flight 149 (1966). Judges were also appointed to committees to review legislation and report to parliament, such as the appointment of Sir John Spicer to the Copyright Law Review Committee, and John Kerr to the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee.. The Copyright Law Review Committee subsequently recommended the appointment of the Copyright Tribunal and Sir John Spicer was appointed as its president. When the Australian Parliament passed the Trade Practices Act in 1965, the Commonwealth Industrial Court was given power to enforce orders of the Trade Practices Tribunal, sections 4 and 68. (2007) 31(3) Melbourne University Law Review 1017. and Sir Richard Eggleston was appointed the first president of the Trade Practices Tribunal. In 1976 when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was established appeals were to the Australian Industrial Court, adding yet another non- industrial matter to the Court's jurisdiction, and Gerard Brennan was appointed as the first President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Replacement by Federal Court The establishment of a federal court was proposed at least as early as 1957, and was announced by Nigel Bowen, the Attorney-General, in 1967. Bowen said that a Commonwealth superior court was necessary because the burden of work in the High Court's original jurisdiction might limit its capacity to perform its primary roles of interpreting the Constitution and as the court of ultimate appeal.. It was however another 9 years until the Federal Court was established, absorbing the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Court, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy and some of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, including appeals from the supreme courts of the territories. It was initially announced that no judge would be appointed over the age of 65, When judges were appointed to the Federal Court on 1 February 1977, two judges over the age of 65 were appointed, Sir Reginald Smithers then aged 73 and Sir John Nimmo, then aged 68. Two judges of the Australian Industrial Court were not appointed to the Federal Court, Sir Percy Joske, then aged 81 and Edward Dunphy, then aged 69.

Elevation of Jehoiachin (2 Kings 25:27‚Äì30) The fall of Jerusalem and exile of Judah (25:1‚Äì21) King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon took the last of Solomon's accumulated masses of gold and silver () as he burned Solomon's Temple, palace and much of the city of Jerusalem (). The fall of Jerusalem parallels the fall of Samaria: #Both cities were besieged three times, from two different enemies. Samaria was twice besieged by the Arameans (; ) and once by the Assyrians (), whereas Jerusalem was besieged once by the Assyrians (2 Kings 18‚Äì19) and twice by the Babylonians (; ). Each city was ultimately destroyed in its third siege. # The attacks happened after the kings of Israel and Judah revolted against powerful neighbouring regional states. The last siege of Jerusalem lasted nineteen months (, 8), until 'the people of the land' being overcome by hunger (, ; , ). Zedekiah tried to escape the city, but was captured and heavily punished (). Thereafter, Jerusalem and its remaining inhabitants suffered destruction, burning, plundering, deportation and executions (). =Verse 7= :And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. KJV * Cross references: Jeremiah 39:7; Jeremiah 52:11 * Huey notes the fulfillment of two prophecies in this verse: *# Zedekiah would see the king of Babylon and then be taken to Babylon (the prophecy recorded in Jeremiah 32:4-5; Jeremiah 34:3) *# Zedekiah would die in Babylon without being able to see that country (the prophecy recorded in Ezekiel 12:13) =Verse 8= :And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: KJV * \\"The fifth month, on seventh day\\": or the 7th of Av, was the start of the destruction of Jerusalem. According to the Talmud,Ta'anit 29a the actual destruction of the First Temple built by King Solomon began on the Ninth of Av (Tisha B'Av), and it continued to burn throughout the Tenth of Av (Jeremiah 52:12). Gill interprets that Nebuzaradan departed from Riblah on the 7th and entered Jerusalem on the 10th. The Talmud reads: :: \\"On the seventh of Av, gentiles entered the Sanctuary, and on the seventh and the eighth they ate there and desecrated it, by engaging in acts of fornication. And on the ninth, adjacent to nightfall, they set fire to it, and it continuously burned the entire day, as it is stated: \\"Woe unto us, for the day has declined, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out\\" ().T.

Governorship of Gedaliah (25:22‚Äì26) The aftermath of Jerusalem's defeat seemed to start promisingly, but ended disastrously when the Babylon- appointed governor, Gedaliah ben Ahikam ben Safan was killed by Ishmael ben Nethaniah ben Elishama of the royal family, causing the remaining inhabitants to flee to Egypt in fear of Babylonian reprisal. This passage probably is a summary of a more detailed report in Jeremiah 40‚Äì41. =Verse 25= :But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. The assassination of Gedaliah was commemorated in Fast of Gedalia, one of the fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem ().Note on 2 Kings 25:25 in NET Bible. Jehoiachin pardoned (25:27‚Äì30) Shifting the view from the land of Judah and the community in Egypt to the situation in Babylonia, the books of Kings end with a sign of hope. King Jehoiachin who was in prison since his capture in 598 BCE (attested by clay tablets from 592 BCE reporting regular provisions he received from Babylonian administrators) was pardoned and received special honor from the king of Babylon. With this passage, the editors of the books wished to stress that the history of Davidic kingdom did not end with the fate of Zedekiah and his sons (verse 7), but continue in Jehoiachin as a symbol of hope for freedom, a return to the homeland, and the restoration of the kingdom. The book of Ezekiel, written during the exile in Babylon, dated its prophecies according to Jehoiachin's regnal years (Ezekiel 1:2; 29:17; 31:1). Among his sons and grandchildren (), Zerubbabel emerged as a hopeful political figure after Babylon's decline (Ezra 2:2; ). The conclusion of the book must have been written during the reign of Evil- Merodach (562-560 BCE), as it seems unaware of the Babylonian king's demise after only two year on throne. =Verse 27= :And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison KJV * \\"Seven and thirtieth year\\": This is 26 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. 2 Kings 25.

The eclipse was visible in North America (except for the Yukon, Alaska and the northernmost part of Greenland), Central America, the Caribbean South America including, the northern parts of Peru and Bolivia and most of Brazil, the westernmost parts of Africa and Europe (westernmost Spain and Portugal, Ireland and parts of Scotland). Areas that were in the edge of the eclipse included the Galapagos Islands. In North America, it occurred in the morning, in South America, midday and in Africa and Europe, near the evening hours. Areas that were inside the umbral portion included the United States such as parts of the north of the state Oregon, Washington Territory (now state), close to the 49th parallel and distant from the Pacific, Idaho, the Cheyenne and the Lakota areas, Nebraska Territory (now state), the states of Kansas, Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, western Kentucky, much of Tennessee, the northeast corner of Alabama, parts of the north of Georgia, the west of North Carolina and nearly all of South Carolina. Off the coast of Africa, it included the Cape Verdean Islands of Sotavento and Boa Vista Island, at the time a Portuguese colony. In Africa, it included most of Senegal, at the time a French colony, southern Agawedj (or Agaouedj, now Mauritania) and parts of Mali. Other In many parts of Brazil except for the south, it was the third consecutive solar eclipse that took place, all of it appeared as partial, the last two were on October 30, 1864 and April 25, 1865, both with an umbral portion in one part.

Life Richter was born in 1844. When she was in her fifties she was earning her living as a seamstress, when she reported to the police that someone had robbed her. In 1893, Richter was admitted to a Heidelberg psychiatric hospital, at the behest of her father and brothers, following what has been recorded as several acute delusional episodes. This led to her being diagnosed as paranoid and she was incarcerated for the rest of her life (26 years). Richter's legacy has survived primarily because of a small, personal jacket that she sewed during her lengthy institutionalization. Pieced together from brown wool and coarse institutional linen, the jacket is covered in messily embroidered deutsche schrift, a script which has largely fallen out of use. The lines of red, yellow, blue, orange, and white threaded text are difficult to read, overlapping and obscured through continual use. Fragments of text from Richter's jacket have been deciphered though their significance and meaning remains unclear (e.g., I am not big, I wish to read, I plunge headlong into disaster). Her case number, 583m, appears repeatedly, suggesting that the jacket may represent a biographical object. Life in German asylums at the fin- de-siecle was highly regimented. While male patients worked in the grounds or in workshops to manufacture shoes or furniture, female patients were expected to clean, sew, knit, and launder institutional uniforms and textiles. Embracing these technologies in a manner, Richter assembled both a and a in the jacket. It bears the marks of its use, including sweat stains and a darted back that may have been meant to accommodate a physical deformity or hunchback. The jacket was collected by Hans Prinzhornn in the early 20th century. Since its rediscovery in the collections in 1980, the jacket has become an iconic piece in the Prinzhorn Collection at Heidelberg. Similar examples of asylum artistry from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries include Lorina Bulwer's samplers and Myrellen's Coat.

Life Graves had two adult children and had owned a gallery and craft studio in Roxburghshire, having lived in Scotland for ten years. She had moved to Bracklesham Bay not long before the murder to look after her then 87-year- old mother Eileen. Christmas 2013 Graves, Eileen, Graves' sister, Janet, and Janet's partner, Nigel, were housesitting in Smugglers Lane, Bosham, for friends who were out of the country at the time. Several members of her family and friends visited the house over this time and enjoyed both the Christmas celebrations and Valerie‚Äôs birthday, which was on Christmas Day. =Murder= On the morning of 30 December, Janet found Graves' body in her bedroom, having suffered severe head and facial injuries. A patio door, leading directly from the bedroom outside to the back of the premises, was found to be unlocked. Investigation A few days after the murder, a hammer was found by police at the entrance to the driveway of Harts' Farm on Hoe Lane, some 600m from the murder scene. The hammer was confirmed to be the murder weapon. A local man was arrested on 14 January 2014 and questioned about the murder, but was bailed and released without further action. In November 2014, a partial DNA profile for the subject was obtained. In January 2015, Sussex Police began a voluntary mass DNA screening programme in Bosham, asking men aged 17 and over to give samples. At the time, officers had interviewed 9,500 people in relation to the case, a reward of ¬£20,000 had been offered and the murder had been featured on Crimewatch. In July 2019 Cristian Sabou was arrested in his home in Dej, Romania on a European Arrest Warrant. Sussex Police sought his extradition. He appeared in court in Cluj-Napoca. He was extradited to the UK and is scheduled to appear before Brighton Magistrates' court on 20 July 2019. He was remanded in custody with a further court appearance scheduled for 30 September. Conviction In November 2019 Sabou was convicted of her murder after pleading guilty. The prosecutor said that Sabou had entered the house with the intent to burgle it, expecting it to be empty. He had been told that a safe in the house contained a large amount of cash and ingots. He had previously done odd jobs for the owners. When he encountered Valerie Graves he attacked her with a hammer, leaving injuries that the prosecution compared to those sustained in traffic accidents. Judge Christine Laing jailed him for life with a minimum term of 23 years and 272 days.

She worked in water-color and black-and-white, as well as genre subjects and landscapes in oils. Since coming to the United States in 1884, Hirschberg contributed every year to the exhibitions of the American Watercolor Society in New York City. One of her most effective water-colors was Maggie Tulliver in the Red Deeps, from George Eliot's \\"Mill on the Floss,\\" which she sent to the Society in 1887. Her Trysting Place was published in an etching by William Langson Lathrop, and another of her drawings entitled How de Do was engraved by Frederick E. Girsch and also published. She also illustrated for magazines. Early years and education Alice Kerr-Nelson was born in England, 12 February 1856, daughter of George W. and Emily Kerr-Nelson. She belonged to an Old county family whose pedigree in Burke's Landed Gentry dates back to Richard Nelson, who flourished in 1377. She was educated without particular attention to her artistic talents. Like every English school-girl, she took drawing lessons as part of her regular studies; but it was not till she was 21 years old, after seeing some water-colors by David Cox and William Midler in the Print Room of the British Museum, that she made any serious effort to work in that medium. At the age of 22, she sent her first picture, a water-color, to the Royal Academy. It was rejected, but it found a purchaser. She obtained leave to copy at the Museum, and then worked at Heatherley School of Fine Art in Newman Street, London. There, she began to paint heads and costumed figures, which she sold in country exhibitions in England. In the school, she met Carl Hirschberg, and they married in 1882. Career After her marriage, she studied in one of the Paris ateliers for women, and exhibited a water- color in the Salon of 1884. Hirschberg said she owed more to her husband's teaching than to the slight criticisms of Raphael Collin, who visited the women's class once a week. Hirschberg exhibited some of her work in the Salon of 1884. In the same year, the Hirschbergs removed to the United States. She exhibited the next year in the collection of the American Watercolor Society, and was a regular contributor to its exhibitions.

With a growing student body, the Culinary Institute purchased a former Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park in 1970, which remains its central campus. The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971 and bachelor's degrees in 1993. The school opened its St. Helena campus in 1995, its Texas campus in 2008, its Singapore campus in 2010, and its Napa campus in 2016.  Beginnings: 1947‚Äì1969  The New Haven Restaurant Institute was founded by the New Haven Restaurant Association, with the assistance of culinary educator Frances Roth and Katharine Angell in New Haven, Connecticut. The vocational training school, intended for returning World War II veterans, held its first classes on May 22, 1946. Roth became the first Administrative Director, and Angell became the first President and Chairman of the Board, serving from 1946 to 1966. She built the school's relations with New Haven and especially close ties with Yale University. The first graduating class consisted of fifty students and three faculty: a dietitian, a baker, and a chef. Originally housed in a storefront in New Haven, the school moved in 1947. With assistance from Yale University, the school purchased the Davies mansion in New Haven's Prospect Hill neighborhood, spending $75,000. The building, known as Angell Hall after James Rowland Angell, had a private chapel, as Angell found important for cooking schools. The building was joined by the adjacent Taft Mansion, now demolished. In 1947 the school was renamed the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut to reflect its growing repute; the school's name was changed again to the Culinary Institute of America in 1951.  Relocation and early history  Enrollment grew to approximately 1,000 students by 1969, beyond the capacity of its original campus, so the school sold the New Haven property to Yale and purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. The 5-story, 150-room building was purchased along with 80 acres for $1 million. Following the purchase, the school began a $4 million renovation. On November 19, 1971, the New York State Board of Regents granted the college its absolute charter incorporating a board of trustees and associates. The following year, the Board of Regents granted a charter for the college to begin awarding associate degrees. It began operating at the Hyde Park location in 1972. In 1973, the school opened the Epicurean Room, later named the Escoffier Restaurant, which had a three-star New York Times rating and four stars on the Mobil Travel Guide. In 1974 the college built three residence halls, housing 880 students total. A fourth residence hall, Hudson Hall, was built in 1896 housing 350 students. Early in 1988, following a $1.5 million grant, the school built the General Foods Nutrition Center, housing the student-run St. Andrew's Cafe. That year the school also opened its Takaki School of Baking and Pastry building, holding three bakeshops, four pastry shops, four kitchens, and four lecture halls. In 1993, the school was granted approval from the Board of Regents to establish two bachelors of professional studies degrees, and the school also opened its library building and Danny Kaye Theater. It was granted a $1.5 million gift from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. In July 1998, the Student Recreation Center opened.  Recent history: 2000‚Äìpresent  The Colavita Center houses the Ristorante Caterina de' Medici Copia, now the CIA at Copia campus The Apple Pie Bakery Caf√© opened in 2000, and the Colavita Center opened the following year. More residence halls were built at the school's Hyde Park campus in 2004. In 2005, Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena. The school's third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio. Two years later, the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility on the campus of Temasek Polytechnic. In 2012, the CIA began offering a bachelor's degree program in culinary science, and in 2014 introduced a bachelor's degree in applied food studies. In 2015, the college expanded its recreation center and added a new dining facility for students, called The Egg. Both are housed in the CIA's Student Commons building. In the same year, the college acquired a portion of Copia, a museum in downtown Napa, California that operated from 2001 to 2008. In 2016, the college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The college, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, purchased the northern portion of the property for $12.5 million (it was recently assessed for $21.3 million). In September 2016, the college replaced its Bachelor of Professional Studies business management program with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree program in food business management. On April 23, 2008, amid complaints directed toward CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved a vote of no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9. The faculty described poor equipment, falling academic standards, and little support in the administration for complaints as causes. The largest complaints, laid out in a thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, substandard school-bland kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. As a result of the event and changes made, the board confirmed unanimously their confidence in him and extended his contract. Following the approval, students began organizing a protest, including creating several student groups on Facebook, and hanging \\"Fire Tim Ryan\\" signs in dorm rooms. The students described further complaints including the administration's close ties with the corporate food industry and less challenging kitchen tasks, such as frying frozen waffle fries. In May the school prevented the campus newspaper from writing about the issue, which prompted its editor to resign. The school later apologized and allowed a full report in the paper's next issue. Ryan held that he was trying to prevent students from being involved in a conflict between the faculty and administration. On April 23, 2013, About 90 students left classes to protest a recent trend of less enforcement of a school policy. The policy, requiring applicants to have professional kitchen experience, has varied from three months to a year, and is currently six months; a 2011 revision allowed front- of-house service to count for the requirement. The protesting students signed letters to teachers and the school administration, gave speeches, and donned name tags with their student loan debt written on them. In May 2017, the college announced it will be offering a Bachelor of Science degree in Hospitality Management starting September 2018. Demographics The number of enrolled women has been increasing since the school opened in 1946, with its first graduating class having one woman among 50 students. By 1980, 20% of students were female, which rose to 30% by 2000 and 40% by 2006. In 2017, women became the majority at the school, with 51.6% of students. Although it is often cited that women were not admitted to the school until 1970, there was one women in the first class held, four in the next, and more in almost every class since then. From 1966 to 1971, women were not admitted, with the stated reason of limited facilities on their New Haven campus.

It is bordered by Paris Road/Highway 47 to the East, Downman Road to the West, and Interstate 10 and Morrison Road to the South. The name in French, \\"La Petite Bois\\" or The Little Woods can be found on the 1883 Lafon-Alphonse Michoud Map drafted by civil-engineer George N. Grandjean. \\"Little Woods\\", as a place designation that continues in local use. Little Woods also directly relates to the treed hammocks that were high Ch√©nier ridges bordered by water and wetlands.  Geological formation  During the late Pleistocene or early Post-Pleistocene age, deltaic processes formed the beaches on the southshore of Lake Pontchartrain. Due to restricted flow resulting from the Pine Island trend, a series of 4600-year old barrier islands were formed. The discoveries of the Pine Island Beach Trend were compiled by Saucier (1963).http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/la/geology/Saucier-1963.pdf Previously, Rowett (1957) identified 87 species of mollusks here. He also established that there was a molluscan assemblage indicative of the conditions of deposition found on the shallow continental shelf described by Parker (1956).  Archaeological remains  Archaeological exploration of the Little Woods Middens led to discoveries of pot sherds and pumice, while burial sites uncovered quartz crystals and bones, no C14 data was collected. Cultural and geologic evidence collected from shell middens indicate this area was inhabited from 500 BCE to 1 CE during the Tchula period. The Tchefuncte Culture existed in the Early Woodland Period and were the first commonly making pottery from the native clay. Major excavations of shell deposits were directed by Maurice Weil in 1934 as part of a CWA project, followed by J. Richard Czajcowski as part of a large LSU New Deal Project. The sites at Little Woods are 16OR1-5, near to the site are two other sites Paris Road 16OR15 and Haughs Canal 16OR28. Of these sites only a few remain today. https://www.nolaenvironmental.gov/nola_public_data/projects/usace_levee/docs/original/draftier6.pdf  Early exploration and development  Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, or Robert de La Salle (1643 ‚Äì 1687) noted among his discoveries that the natives in Louisiana lived on pier like structures. Later, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, Sieur d'Iberville, or Sieur d'Iberville et d'Ardilli√®res (1661 ‚Äì1706) explored the area for trade, from this time, King Louis XIV of France had a trading agreement with the local natives. A road was planned by Pierre Denis de la Ronde (1762 - 1824), the planned road went from Little Woods to the town of Versailles in St. Bernard Parish he envisioned a canal linking Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River along what is now Paris Road. In 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte sold the Louisiana territories to the Spain.  Early development  By 1882, Little Woods was part of the Lafon-Alphonse Michaud Plantation and a railroad was being constructed to link New Orleans as part of New Orleans & Northeastern Railroad. The longest train trestle bridge in the world was constructed.https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/47th- congress/session-1/c47s1ch291.pdf Railroad workers built section houses along the track and switched the passing trains onto the single track trestle, therefore, Little Woods became a whistle stop where trains would wait to cross the bridge. The train route leaving New Orleans to Little Woods is described in a newspaper article from 1887. A large wooden dancing platform on piers is noted, also camps had thatched Palmetto roofs, people fished and sold their seafood in the city. In 1908 a train wreck occurred, one evening at the Little Woods Station two trains collided in the fog killing prominent figures of the community. One of the twelve victims was Jacob Salmen of The Salmen Brothers Brick and Lumber Company who later succumbed to his injuries.  The Roaring Twenties  Louis Armstrong recalled, on page 47 of his autobiography, Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans, in 1913 at 13 years old, he was made a band leader and was sent to play at Milneberg and Little Woods.https://archive.org/stream/satchmomylifeinn002187mbp/satchmomylifeinn002187mbp_djvu.txt By the 1920s hundreds of camps ranged from Milneberg at West End to Little Woods in the East. Little Woods had become a vacation resort, Ragtime and early Jazz, called Ragajazz, was the music of the day.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064020/1921-04-28/ed- 1/seq-1/ Heard in the area were bands like Kid Stevenson Jazz Hounds, Alcide yellow Nunez of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, and Froggy's Moonlight Serenaders. During the 1920s plans for construction at Milneberg led to a few of those camps at that location to be moved to Little Woods.

The game is a reboot of Sunsoft's Blaster Master for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and was released worldwide in March 2017, and was released of PS4 version on June 29, 2020. As in the NES original, the game's plot centers around Jason Frudnick, a young man who descends into a subterranean world to rescue a frog creature named Fred. Players control Jason behind the wheel of a tank vehicle called SOPHIA, exploring large environments and defeating various mutant enemies. Jason can also exit the tank to explore various areas into which the tank cannot venture. In addition to redone graphics and sound, Blaster Master Zero also adds various tweaks and features not seen in the NES game. Blaster Master Zero 2 was announced in March 2019. It was released on March 20, 2019 on Nintendo Switch and November 29, 2019 on Microsoft Windows., and was released for PS4 on June 29, 2020. Gameplay The game plays similarly to the NES original. Players control the SOPHIA vehicle in the side- scrolling levels, exploring environments and defeating enemies using the tank's various weapons. The player character Jason can also hop out of the tank to enter various passages and doors, where the view switches to an overhead perspective. Players can find various upgrades to the tank that may allow access to previously inaccessible areas. Throughout the game the player also encounters various boss characters that must be defeated to progress to later levels. A multiplayer mode allows a second player to take control of an aiming reticle to shoot at enemies. Plot and setting The game combines plot elements and character names from the original Blaster Master, its Worlds of Power novelization, as well as the Japanese version of the game, Metafight. In a distant future, earth falls into an ice age, after countless wars and environmental disasters. Due to the ice age, the human race was forced to live underground. When the ice age came to an end, humanity began making methods they learned while living underground to restore the planet and the environment. During that time, a large, mysterious comet fell to the earth, but that did not hinder their effort to restore the lost ecosystems, and humans were able to live on the earth's surface once again. Several hundred years later, Jason Frudnick, a young genius in the field of robotics, finds an unusual-looking and frog-like creature that he names Fred. His research is interrupted when Fred escapes into a wormhole that seemed to appear from nowhere, and Jason finds himself inside one of the underground environments from the past, where he encounters an armored tank named SOPHIA III, which he proceeds to use in order to fend off against the mutants that suddenly took over the underground and locate Fred. During his quest, Jason finds an unconscious girl named Eve, who has a strange connection to SOPHIA III. Together, they find and rescue Fred, whereupon Jason finds out that both Eve and Fred are actually aliens. Fred is a probe sent by the inhabitants of Eve's planet to locate the Mutants, who are alien invaders that once attempted to conquer her planet, whereas Eve is an android created to serve as pilot and support of SOPHIA III. Together, they defeat the Underworld Lord, who was the leader of the Mutants. In the basic ending, Eve thanks Jason and leaves Earth with the tank and, unbeknownst to Jason, somberly destroys herself along with it. If the player has collected all of SOPHIA III's weapon and upgrade chips, and all of the area maps, then an extended ending is unlocked. After the battle, Eve knocks Jason unconscious and leaves with SOPHIA III to defeat the true leader of the Mutants, the Mutant Core, alone. Fred uses his ability to create wormholes to take Jason to a base where he finds a new tank, the SOPHIA ZERO, a far more powerful version of the SOPHIA III. Eventually, Jason finds the Mutant Core, which has taken over and corrupted the SOPHIA III with Eve trapped inside of it. Jason fights and disables the corrupted SOPHIA III long enough to rescue Eve and destroys the SOPHIA III and the Mutant Core along with it. In the end, Eve finds out that SOPHIA ZERO was created for her by Kane and Jennifer Gardner, Eve's parents/creators. Eve is truly thankful for Jason that not only he saved the planet but also be there for her. The game ends with Jason watching the scenery, now filled with greenery, with Eve and Fred perched atop of SOPHIA ZERO.  Development  Two months after the game's release, Inti Creates released a patch for the game that added a new \\"Destroyer Mode\\", a harder difficulty setting available after players beat the game. They also announced the release of two DLC characters, Gunvolt from the company's Azure Striker Gunvolt and Ekoro from Gal*Gun, another Inti Creates title. Guest characters Shantae and Shovel Knight were subsequently announced in July. An update released in October 2017 added a boss rush game mode. Reception The game has received largely positive reviews. It received praise for its retro art style and being largely faithful to the original game, with Destructoid calling it \\"a loving recreation that serves as both a companion and in some ways a replacement for the original.\\" However, the game was also criticized for not improving enough over the original as well as being too easy. IGN's Tristan Ogilvie commented that the game \\"never offers an old-school level of adversity to match its charmingly chunky 8-bit aesthetic\\", while Game Informer called it \\"a blast from the past that feels like a bit of a relic.\\" By October 2017, Inti Creates reported over 110,000 sales for the game.

According to Jewish tradition, they were accepted by Moses as an integral part of the people. Their influence is said to have been involved in the golden calf and other incidents where the people questioned Moses and his laws. Etymology According to contemporary Jewish Orthodox commentary Da'at Miqra, the words roughly correspond to the \\"mixed many\\", while Targum Onkelos translates it as \\"many foreigners\\". The term appears in Exodus 12:38: \\"A mixed crowd also went up with them, and livestock in great numbers, both flocks and herds\\" (NRSV). The \\"mixed crowd\\" is an English rendering of Erev Rav. While Exodus 12:38 is the only mention of the complete term Erev Rav in the entire Tanakh, the term Erev by itself (which also means evening in Hebrew),In Hebrew spelling without niqqud (vowel-points) the erev for evening and the erev for \\"mixed\\" are spelled identically. However, the first vowel in the two words is written and pronounced differently: evening has a segol, while mixed has a tzere. also appears in Nehemiah 13:3, where it is used to refer to non-Jews.Bar, Shaul. \\"Who Were The Mixed Multitudes?\\" Hebrew Studies, vol. 49, 2008, pp. 27‚Äì39., (www.jstor.org/stable/27913875). Biblical scholar Shaul Bar has suggested that the term may have referred specifically to foreign mercenaries who intermarried with the Israelite people in Egypt. In modern Hebrew, it is used as an idiom for a mixture that exists outside of Judaism, especially in reference to non-Jews. Jewish tradition According to the Arizal, in every generation, the souls of the Erev Rav are reincarnated in numerous individuals. The Zohar, which is the foundational text for Kabbalistic thought, says the Erev Rav not only exists in each generation, but it continues to be the cause for most of the problems affecting the Jewish people.The initial letters of the words Rosh Bnei Yisrael (◊®◊ê◊© ◊ë◊†◊ô ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, the heads of the Jewish people) spell ReBY ( ◊®◊ë◊ô, teacher). This indicates that the Jews require a qualified teacher to transmit God‚Äôs message. The initial letters of the words Rasha'im Ba-choshekh Yidamu (◊®◊©◊¢◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ó◊©◊ö ◊ô◊ì◊û◊ï, the wicked are cut off in darkness) (I Samuel 2: 9) also spell ReBY (◊®◊ë◊ô) (Likutey Moharan I, 111). In this case, it is a reference to unworthy people who wrest the leadership of the Jews from genuine teachers. These false leaders, who are referred to as the ‚Äúmixed multitude,‚Äù will eventually be ‚Äúcut off.‚Äù And then, the Zohar (III, 297b) teaches: ‚ÄúWhen the mixed multitude leaves the presence of the Jews, the verse ‚ÄòCount the heads of the Jewish people‚Äô will be fulfilled‚Äù Currently, the term \\"Erev Rav\\" is used by Jews in a derogatory manner describing someone who is perceived as a traitor.

Together with Uuno Kailas, Sarkia was the most prominent Finnish poet of the 1930s. As Kailas, his poetry also had homosexual themes. Sarkia published four collections of poetry between 1929 and 1943. In addition to his own works, Sarkia was known as a translator of French and Italian poetry. Sarkia was also a contemporary member of the Finnish literary group Tulenkantajat. Sarkia never had a permanent home or regular job and he used to spend terms in sanatoriums. Sarkia died of tuberculosis at the age of 43.  Life  Sarkia was born in the municipality of Kiikka, Satakunta in southwest Finland as an illegitimate child of the maid Aleksandra Sulin. Sarkia's father was most likely the local carpenter Malakias Korkki. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1916 and Sarkia moved to live with his godmother Hilda Runni. With a help of his grandparents Sarkia was able to finish the secondary school in Tyrv√§√§. During his schoolyears, Sarkia got interested in poetry and also became aware of his homosexuality.

Sarkia graduated from the secondary school in 1923 and accomplished his military service in the Hennala Garrison in the spring of 1924. He worked for a year as a tutor in Rantasalmi and entered the University of Helsinki in 1925. In Helsinki Sarkia lived in cheap accommodation, suffered from poverty and was hospitalized several times for the tuberculosis he caught during the military service. In 1926 he received a scholarship and made a short trip to Germany. A year later he began studies at the University of Turku, joining the literary circle of V. A. Koskenniemi. His first collection, Kahlittu (‚Ä≥Chained‚Ä≥) was released in 1929. The second collection, Velka el√§m√§lle (‚Ä≥The Debt to Life‚Ä≥) in 1931, included the poem Antinous, which dealt with homoerotic love. Antinous was the lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian. The title poem was about love and desertion, dedicated to his mother. His two first collections did not cause much attention, but Sarkia became known for his translation of Arthur Rimbaud's Le Bateau ivre in 1932. In December 1933 Sarkia had a job at the university library in Turku, where the chief librarian was the writer Volter Kilpi. Just a month later, Sarkia tried to commit suicide with an oversdose of barbiturate. Sarkia's third book, Unen kaivo (‚Ä≥The Well of Dreams‚Ä≥, 1936), was a commercial and critical success. The collection included the poem Barcarola, which is influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's Die Sonne sinkt. It has been described as one of his most wonderful poems. In 1937, Sarkia traveled to Switzerland where he spent several months. He also visited Rome where Sarkia kept a speech against Hitler and was arrested. The grave of Kaarlo Sarkia in Helsinki. Sarkia never graduated from the universities of Helsinki or Turku. In the early 1943, Sarkia lived a couple of months in the small village of Sysm√§, but moved soon to Helsinki, as the state granted him a pension. Sarkia also received a monthly payment from his publisher WSOY. At this time, Sarkia was already seriously ill. His fourth book, Kohtalon vaaka (‚Ä≥The Scale of Fate‚Ä≥) came out the same year, in the middle of the World War II, when Finland was fighting as an ally of Nazi Germany. Sarkia did not join the writers who produced patriotic propaganda. Instead, the collection featured several pacifist and anti-war poems. As a result, Sarkia was criticized for being unpatriotic. In 1944 Sarkia edited his collections into a single volume Runot (‚Ä≥The Poems‚Ä≥). As the war ended, Sarkia travelled to Sweden for a period at a local sanatorium. Sarkia never made it to the hospital, but spent his time in a Stockholm hotel. When Sarkia returned Finland, he went to Sysm√§ to the care of two sisters with whom he had become acquainted. Sarkia died there of tuberculosis in November 1945 at the age of 43. He was buried to the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.  Importance  According to the Finnish writer Tuomas Anhava, Sarkia occupies same position in the history of Finnish poetry that John Keats has in English and Alfred de Musset in French poetry. Sarkia has been described as a ‚Ä≥composer of words‚Ä≥ as his poems are known of their euphony and rhythm. Many of Sarkia's poems have been set to music, by composers like Erik Bergman and Kaj Chydenius. His poetry has even influenced on the lyrics of the Finnish death metal group Insomnium. Among the poets he translated were Arthur Rimbaud, Fran√ßois Villon, Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire and Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio. Sarkia's translation of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal has been praised of its rich imagery and rhythmical experimentations. Another famous translation is the Finnish version of Rimbaud's Le Bateau ivre, which is considered ‚Ä≥brilliant‚Ä≥. Sarkia's poems have never been published as a separate book in English. In 2008, the literary magazine Poetry Salzburg Review published some English translations by Pentti M. Rautaharju, a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Minnesota.  Commemoration  The literary society Sarkia-Seura was established in 1952. The Sarkia museum was opened in 1959 in the house where Sarkia lived with his godmother after his mother had died. Sarkia's statue was erected to his birthplace Kiikka in 1960. It is a work of the Finnish sculptor Kauko R√§ike. In 2010, the artistic residence Villa Sarkia, run by the literary society Nuoren Voiman Liitto, was opened in Sysm√§. There is a street commemorating Kaarlo Sarkia in Vermonniitty (Espoo) named Kaarlo Sarkian katu. Streets commemorating other 1930s artists Uuno Kailas and Anna Sahlst√©n are also found nearby.

The prefix ‚ÄúMuthu‚Äù, literally means ‚Äúpearl‚Äù. \\"Mari\\" means rain and \\"Amman\\" means mother in Tamil language. The temple is dedicated to Mariamman, the goddess of rain and fertility.  History  The land was originally part of a paddy field and was gifted by the owner in 1852. The current temple was built in 1874, funded by the Nattukkottai Chettiar. This temple is used by both Hindus and Buddhists. The temple was originally a small statue under a tree prayed to by the Hindu people but has been developed by the people in Matale. The temple was severely damaged during the anti-Tamil riots in July 1983 but has been subsequently restored. One of the most visually dominant features of this temple is its high Gopuram ('Raja Koburum'), a large decorated tower located above the main northern gateway ('Vadakku Vaayil') to the temple. The Raja Koburum is one of the largest Gopurams in Sri Lanka. The 1008 statues of Hindu deities are the work of South Indian sculptor, Nagalingam and his son Ramanathan, with the help of about 100 designers, painters and architects from Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The Raja Koburum was completed in 2007 at the cost of approximately Rs 150M.  Special events  The main religious festivals including the chariot festival at the temple are celebrated during February or March. The temple has five ornate chariots, which are used to convey statues of Hindu deities around the city on 'Ther' or 'Vettai Thiruvizha', the chariot ceremony day, which is held the day before 'Medin Poya' (the Poya day in March).  Wedding hall  There is a large wedding hall for the Hindu people. This wedding hall has been in use from 1856 to the present.

Cannabis has served as an entheogen‚Äîa chemical substance used in religious or spiritual contexts‚Äîin the Indian subcontinent since the Vedic period dating back to approximately 1500 BCE, but perhaps as far back as 2000 BCE. Cannabis has been used by shamanic and pagan cultures to ponder deeply religious and philosophical subjects related to their tribe or society, to achieve a form of enlightenment, to unravel unknown facts and realms of the human mind and subconscious, and also as an aphrodisiac during rituals or orgies.Sayin, H. U. (2014). The Consumption of Psychoactive Plants in Ancient Global and Anatolian Cultures During Religious Rituals: The Roots of the Eruption of Mythological Figures and Common Symbols in Religions and Myths. NeuroQuantology, 12(2). There are several references in Greek mythology to a powerful drug that eliminated anguish and sorrow. Herodotus wrote about early ceremonial practices by the Scythians, thought to have occurred from the 5th to 2nd century BCE. Itinerant Hindu saints have used it in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Over the last few decades hundreds of archaeological and anthropological items of evidence have come out of Mexican, Mayan and Aztec cultures that suggest cannabis, along with magic mushrooms (psilocybin), peyote (mescaline) and other psychoactive plants were used in cultural shamanic and religious rituals. Mexican-Indian communities occasionally use cannabis in religious ceremonies by leaving bundles of it on church altars to be consumed by the attendees.Warf, B. (2014), High Points: An Historical Geography of Cannabis. Geogr Rev, 104: 414-438. doi:10.1111/j.1931-0846.2014.12038.x  Indian subcontinent  Bhang eaters from India c. 1790. Bhang is an edible preparation of cannabis native to the Indian subcontinent. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE by Hindus in ancient India. The earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the Indian subcontinent come from the Atharva Veda estimated to have been written sometime around 2000‚Äì1400 BCE, which mentions cannabis as one of the \\"five sacred plants... which release us from anxiety\\" and that a guardian angel resides in its leaves. The Vedas also refer to it as a \\"source of happiness,\\" \\"joy-giver\\" and \\"liberator,\\" and in the Raja Valabba, the gods send hemp to the human race so that they might attain delight, lose fear and have sexual desires. Many households in India own and grow a cannabis plant to be able to offer cannabis to a passing sadhu (ascetic holy men), and during some evening devotional services it is not uncommon for cannabis to be smoked by everyone present.Touw, M. (1981). The religious and medicinal uses of Cannabis in China, India and Tibet. Journal of psychoactive drugs, 13(1), 23-34. A sadhu, or holy person, smoking cannabis in Kolkata, India. Cannabis was often consumed in weddings or festivals honoring Shiva, who is said to have brought it down from the Himalayas. It is still offered to Shiva in temples on Shivaratri day, while devotional meetings called bhajans, although not necessarily associated with Shiva, are occasions for devotees to consume the drug liberally. Yogis or sadhus along with other Hindu mystics have been known to smoke a mixture of cannabis sativa and tobacco in order to enhance meditation. This is particularly common during the festival of Diwali and Kumbha Mela. There are three types of cannabis used in the Indian subcontinent. The first, bhang, a type of cannabis edible, consists of the leaves and plant tops of the marijuana plant. It is usually consumed as an infusion in beverage form, and varies in strength according to how much cannabis is used in the preparation. The second, ganja, consisting of the leaves and the plant tops, is smoked. The third, called charas or hashish, consists of the resinous buds and/or extracted resin from the leaves of the marijuana plant. Typically, bhang is the most commonly used form of cannabis in religious festivals. In Tantric Buddhism, which originated in the Tibeto- Himalayan region, cannabis serves as an important part of a traditional ritual (which may or may not also include sexual intercourse). Cannabis is taken to facilitate meditation and also heighten awareness of all aspects of the ceremony, with a large oral dosage being taken in time with the ceremony so that the climax of the \\"high\\" coincides with the climax of the ceremony. Ancient China The sinologist and historian Joseph Needham concluded \\"the hallucinogenic properties of hemp were common knowledge in Chinese medical and Taoist circles for two millennia or more\\",Joseph Needham and Gwei-djen Lu (1974). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality. Cambridge University Press, p. 152 and other scholars associated Chinese wu (shamans) with the entheogenic use of cannabis in Central Asian shamanism.\\"Before the Christian Era\\" from The oldest texts of Traditional Chinese Medicine listed herbal uses for cannabis and noted some psychodynamic effects. The (ca. 100 CE) Chinese pharmacopeia Shennong Ben Cao Jing (Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica) described the use of mafen È∫ªËï° \\"cannabis fruit/seeds\\": A Taoist priest in the fifth century A.D. wrote in the Ming-I Pieh Lu that: Later pharmacopia repeated this description, for instance the (ca. 1100 CE) Zhenglei bencao Ë≠âÈ°ûÊú¨Ëçâ (\\"Classified Materia Medica\\"): The (ca. 730) dietary therapy book Shiliao bencao È£üÁôÇÊú¨Ëçâ (\\"Nutritional Materia Medica\\") prescribes daily consumption of cannabis in the following case: \\"those who wish to see demons should take it (with certain other drugs) for up to a hundred days.\\" Yangshao culture (ca. 4800 BCE) amphora with hemp cord design Cannabis has been cultivated in China since Neolithic times, for instance, hemp cords were used to create the characteristic line designs on Yangshao culture pottery). Early Chinese classics have many references to using the plant for clothing, fiber, and food, but none to its psychotropic properties. Some researchers think Chinese associations of cannabis with \\"indigenous central Asian shamanistic practices\\" can explain this \\"peculiar silence\\".Touw, Mia (1981). \\"The Religious and Medicinal Uses of Cannabis in China, India, and Tibet\\" , Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 13.1:23-34, p 23. The botanist Li Hui- lin noted linguistic evidence that the \\"stupefying effect of the hemp plant was commonly known from extremely early times\\"; the word ma \\"cannabis; hemp\\" has connotations of \\"numbed; tingling; senseless\\" (e.g., mamu È∫ªÊú® \\"numb\\" and mazui È∫ªÈÜâ \\"anesthetic; narcotic\\"), which \\"apparently derived from the properties of the fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes.\\"Li (1973), p. 297-298. Li suggested shamans in Northeast Asia transmitted the medical and spiritual uses of cannabis to the ancient Chinese wu Â∑´ \\"shaman; spirit medium; doctor\\". Robert Clarke and Mark Merlin, the authors of Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany, suggest that: Ancient Central Asia The (ca. 440 BCE) Greek Histories of Herodotus record the early Scythians using cannabis steam baths. What Herodotus called the \\"hemp-seed\\" must have been the whole flowering tops of the plant, where the psychoactive resin is produced along with the fruit (\\"seeds\\"). Herodotus also noted that the Thracians, a people who had intimate contact with the Scythians, introduced the plant to the Dacians where it became popular among a shamanic cult named the Kapnobatai, or \\"Those Who Walk in the Clouds.\\" The shamans of the cult, also called Kapnobatai, were known to use hemp smoke to induce visions and trances. Burial tombs of the Phrygians and Scythians frequently contained cannabis sativa seeds. Several of the Tarim mummies excavated near Turpan in Xinjiang province of Northwestern China were buried with sacks of cannabis next to their heads. Based on additional grave goods, archaeologists concluded these individuals were shamans: \\"The marijuana must have been buried with the dead shamans who dreamed of continuing the profession in another world.\\" A team of scientists analyzed one shamanistic tomb that contained a leather basket with well-preserved cannabis (789 grams of leaves, shoots, and fruits; AMS dated 2475 ¬± 30 years BP) and a wooden bowl with cannabis traces. Lacking any \\"suitable evidence that the ancient, indigenous people utilized Cannabis for food, oil, or fiber\\", they concluded \\"the deceased was more concerned with the intoxicant and/or medicinal value of the Cannabis remains.\\" The Chinese archaeologist Hongen Jiang and his colleagues excavated a circa 2,400-2,800 BP tomb in northwest China's Turpan Basin and found the remains of an approximately 35-year-old man with Caucasian features who had been buried with thirteen 1-meter cannabis plants, placed diagonally across his chest. Jiang said this is the first archeological discovery of complete cannabis plants, as well as the first incidence of their use as a burial shroud.Hongen Jiang et al. (2016), \\"Ancient Cannabis Burial Shroud in a Central Eurasian Cemetery\\", Economic Botany 70.3: 213-221.Kristin Romey, Ancient Cannabis 'Burial Shroud' Discovered in Desert Oasis, National Geographic, 4 October 2016. Cannabis has been associated with Central Asian burial rituals around the 5th century BCE, as archaeological excavations in 1947 of a series of burial mounds at Pazyryk in the Altai Mountains of Siberia revealed 1.2 meter- high wooden frame tents in each of the mounds. Each frame surrounded a bronze vessel filled with the remains of hemp seeds and stones, and were presumably left smoking in the grave. In one of the mounds, a leather pouch containing hemp seeds, and scattered hemp, coriander, and melilotus seeds were also recovered.Merlin M. D. Archaeological evidence for the tradition of psychoactive plant use in the old world. Economic Botany, 2003; 57(3): 295‚Äì323. More recent excavations indicate the cannabis used in the most ancient burials were devoid of THC, while significantly stronger psychoactive cannabis was employed at least 2,500 years ago in the Pamir Mountains. Historical Africa According to Alfred Dunhill (1924), Africans have had a long tradition of smoking hemp in gourd pipes, asserting that by 1884 the King of the Baluka tribe of the Congo had established a \\"riamba\\" or hemp-smoking cult in place of fetish-worship. Enormous gourd pipes were used.[Dunhill, Alfred  \\"The Pipe Book\\"  London  A & C Black, 1924] Cannabis was used in Africa to restore appetite and relieve pain of hemorrhoids. It was also used as an antiseptic. In a number of countries, it was used to treat tetanus, hydrophobia, delirium tremens, infantile convulsions, neuralgia and other nervous disorders, cholera, menorrhagia, rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and protracted labor during childbirth. In Africa, there were a number of cults and sects of hemp worship. Pogge and Wissman, during their explorations of 1881, visited the Bashilenge, living on the northern borders of the Lundu, between Sankrua and Balua. They found large plots of land around the villages used for the cultivation of hemp. Originally there were small clubs of hemp smokers, bound by ties of friendship, but these eventually led to the formation of a religious cult. The Bashilenge called themselves Bena Riamba, \\"the sons of hemp\\", and their land Lubuku, meaning friendship. They greeted each other with the expression \\"moio\\", meaning both \\"hemp\\" and \\"life.\\" Each tribesman was required to participate in the cult of Riamba and show his devotion by smoking as frequently as possible. They attributed universal magical powers to hemp, which was thought to combat all kinds of evil and they took it when they went to war and when they traveled. There were initiation rites for new members which usually took place before a war or long journey. The hemp pipe assumed a symbolic meaning for the Bashilenge somewhat analogous to the significance which the peace pipe had for American Indians. No holiday, no trade agreement, no peace treaty was transacted without it. In the middle Sahara region, the Senusi sect also cultivated hemp on a large scale for use in religious ceremonies.Wissman et al. 1888 Germanic paganism In ancient Germanic paganism, cannabis was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya. The harvesting of the plant was connected with an erotic high festival. It was believed that Freya lived as a fertile force in the plant's feminine flowers and by ingesting them one became influenced by this divine force. Linguistics offers further evidence of prehistoric use of cannabis by Germanic peoples: The word hemp derives from Old English h√¶nep, from Proto-Germanic *hanapiz, from the same Scythian word that cannabis derives from. The etymology of this word follows Grimm's Law by which Proto-Indo-European initial *k- becomes *h- in Germanic. The shift of *k‚Üíh indicates it was a loanword into the Germanic parent language at a time depth no later than the separation of Common Germanic from Proto-Indo-European, about 500 BC. The Celts may have also used cannabis, as evidence of hashish traces were found in Hallstatt, birthplace of Celtic culture. Also, the Dacians and the Scythians had a tradition where a fire was made in an enclosed space and cannabis seeds were burnt and the resulting smoke ingested.  Middle East  There exist reports that cannabis was ritually consumed by a Sufi sect called Melamis, and also in the cult of Hassan Sabbah, or the Hashshashin. The Assyrians, Egyptians, and Hebrews, among other Semitic cultures of the Middle East, mostly acquired cannabis from Aryan cultures and have burned it as an incense as early as 1000 BC. In Egypt, cannabis pollen was recovered from the tomb of Ramses II, who governed for sixty‚Äêseven years during the 19th dynasty, and several mummies contain trace cannabinoids. Cannabis oil was likely used throughout the Middle East for centuries before and after the birth of Christ. It is mentioned in the original Hebrew Old Testament and in its Aramaic translations as both incense and as intoxicant. Cannabis, as an incense, was used in the temples of Assyria and Babylon because \\"its aroma was pleasing to the Gods.\\" In Exodus 30:23 of the Bible, God directed Moses to make a holy oil composed of ‚Äúmyrrh, sweet cinnamon, kaneh bosm and kassia‚Äù. The root kan has two meanings in many Ancient languages; hemp and reed. In numerous translations of the original Hebrew Bible, kaneh bosm has been erroneously translated as ‚Äúcalamus‚Äù or ‚Äúaromatic reed,‚Äù when the actual translation is closer to hemp. This error appears in translations as early as the third century B.C in Septuagint, the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and also appears in following translations such as Martin Luther's.

Career R/V HERO near Arctowski Research Base. Hero, named after the sloop that Nathaniel Palmer sailed when he sighted Antarctica, was launched in 1968 by the shipyard of Harvey F. Gamage in South Bristol, Maine. She arrived in Antarctica at Palmer Station for the first time in December, and for the next sixteen years transported scientists around the continent to perform research. She was the first vessel to be dedicated full time to scientists at Palmer Station, allowing them access to areas further afield they had been previously unable to access reliably. After the 1984 research season, Hero was acquired by the Port of Umpqua for $5,000 and the nonprofit International Oceanographic Hero Foundation was formed by local residents with the intention to restore Hero into a museum ship. The foundation ran short of money and members, and was unable to find funding to pay for either restoration or maintenance of the vessel, and was dissolved in 1997. After an unsuccessful effort by former Hero crewmember John Morrison to purchase and restore the vessel, she was sold at auction to local fisherman Bill Wechter in 2000, who was able to move Hero to drydock for some restoration, and later moved her to Newport, Oregon. In 2008 she was sold to another local named Sun Feather LightDancer, who moved her to Bay Center, Washington, and intended to restore her but was unable to obtain the required financing.

He served as the County Attorney for Liberty County, Montana, and later as the mayor of Chester, Montana. During his tenure as mayor, he founded the Montana Consumers Council. From 1970 to 1975, he served as the Director of the Montana Aeronautics Commission (which later became the Aeronautics Division of the Montana Department of Transportation). He was appointed the first Montana Workers' Compensation Court judge in July 1975, organizing the court and serving until August 1981. He won a nonpartisan election as an associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court in 1984, and served from January 2, 1985, until his retirement on December 31, 2000. Early life and military service William E. Hunt was born on February 28, 1923, in Tacoma, Washington, to William C. and Ann ( Nolan) Hunt, the second of eight children. His father was a dentist and his mother was a registered nurse, and the family was prosperous. During the Great Depression, William C. Hunt could no longer earn enough money as a dentist to provide for his family, so the Hunts moved to a farm owned by the Nolan family near Burlington, Iowa, where they were able to survive by growing their own food. William E. Hunt dropped out of high school at the age of 16. Declaring he was born February 29, 1920, he enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard in April 1939. He was assigned to the somewhat newly-organized 113th Cavalry, which at that time still exclusively used horses. The 113th Cavalry began conversion into a combined horse-armored unit in September 1940 and was mobilized into federal service on January 13, 1941. Hunt trained as a radio operator, and participated in the United States Army's landing in Algeria and Sicily before being among the first wave of soldiers going ashore at Utah Beach as part of the Normandy Landings on June 6, 1944. He later said about the war, \\"If it taught me anything, it taught me how lucky I was. The war taught me we're all the same. We all do our best, and we can't worry about our differences.\\" Another formative experience for Hunt was exposure to the racial segregation faced by African American soldiers during the war, which deeply troubled him. Hunt mustered out of the army in 1945, but reenlisted in 1946. He served in the United States Army Reserve and the Montana Army National Guard until 1950. He graduated from the Army Officer Candidate School, and rose to the rank of captain. Education and legal career =County offices and advocate= While in the military, Hunt obtained his GED. Hunt decided to enroll in college using the benefits due to him under the G.I. Bill, and had settled on the University of Washington. His mother suggested that, while traveling to Seattle, Hunt stop at the University of Montana to check out an alternative. Hunt met with a dean at the school, who convinced him to stay in Missoula. To support himself in college, Hunt worked as a \\"crew caller\\" for the Northern Pacific Railway, contacting off-duty train crews to tell them to report to work, bumping them from assignments, and sometimes laying them off. Hunt received his combined BA/JD degree in 1955. Hunt, by now married, moved to Walla Walla, Washington, to practice law, but a short time later moved his practice to Havre, Montana. Hunt then won a position in 1960 as the county attorney for nearby Liberty County, Montana. He and his family moved to Chester, the county seat. Hunt won election as mayor of the town of Chester, and served from May 1, 1967, to April 30, 1969. While serving as mayor of Chester, Hunt became concerned as the Montana Power Company raised rates more than six-fold in two years. Hunt subsequently formed the Montana Consumer Council in 1968 as a means of raising funds to investigate the rate increase as well as providing a voice for consumers in the state. Hunt was the organization's first executive director. The deficiencies in protecting consumer interests which were exposed by the Montana Consumer Council led to the creation of a state consumers' counsel office in the 1972 Constitution of Montana. In 1970, Hunt was named a trustee of Central Montana Legal Services, a nonprofit organization which provides legal services to the indigent and poor. He and his family moved to Helena that year. Later that year, Montana Governor Forrest H. Anderson appointed Hunt the Director of the Montana Aeronautics Commission. Montana voters adopted a new state constitution in 1972. The Aeronautics Commission became the Aeronautics Division of the Montana Department of Transportation, and Hunt oversaw the transition from independent agency to division within a larger department. =Montana Workers' Compensation Court judge= Hunt was named the first Montana Workers' Compensation Court judge in 1975. Initially, after adoption of the 1972 state constitution, the Montana Legislature established an Industrial Accident Board within the new Montana Department of Labor and Industry to both run the state workers' compensation insurance fund and to adjudicate the claims of injured workers. This conflict of interest led to denial and approval of injury awards which were not based on facts, lump-sum payments to workers, improper and inappropriate internal procedures, poor recordkeeping, and the increasing personal involvement of the board's administrator in disputes. Courts began overturning board decisions with increasing frequency, and began fining and punishing the agency. After a state audit of the board revealed the extent of these problems, the state legislature passed a bill in 1975 which established a quasi-judicial Workers' Compensation Court to separate the adjudication function of the agency from its administrative and fiduciary duties. Governor Thomas L. Judge nominated Hunt to be the first Workers' Compensation Court judge. Hunt was confirmed by the Montana Senate and served in that capacity from July 1975 to August 1981. Hunt became known statewide as \\"The Flying Judge\\" for his extensive travels around the state of Montana holding workers' compensation court hearings. After retiring as Workers' Compensation Court judge in 1981, Hunt returned to the private practice of law in Helena. =Montana Supreme Court= In 1984, Hunt ran for the position of Associate Justice of the Montana Supreme Court after Justice Daniel J. Shea declined to seek reelection. Article VII, Section 8 of the state constitution provides for the nonpartisan election, rather than appointment, of Montana Supreme Court justices. In 1935, the state legislature enacted legislation barring political parties from endorsing, making contributions to, or making expenditures on behalf of or against judicial candidates. Hunt ran in a crowded primary field, which included Doris Swords Poppler, a former Yellowstone County Attorney and one of the most prominent women lawyers in the state; Joe R. Roberts, Montana Assistant Attorney General; Donald D. McIntyre, Chief Legal Counsel for the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation; and Patricia M. Springer, an attorney. Poppler won the nonpartisan primary with 34.3 percent of the vote (46,659 votes). Hunt came in second place with 19.0 percent of the vote (25,906 votes), beating Joe R. Roberts by a razor-thin margin (18.8 percent of the votes; 25,555 votes). Per state law, the top two vote-getters advanced to the general election. In the general election campaign, Hunt asked voters to consider his experiences as an elected official and judge. \\"I think I have acquired some knowledge, a great deal of compassion and perhaps a little wisdom,\\" he said. In the general election, Hunt won 54.6 percent of the vote (184,935) to Poppler's 45.4 percent (153,602 votes). Hunt ran unopposed for a second term in 1992. Under Montana state law, judges in uncontested nonpartisan primary elections automatically advance to the general election. The general election then becomes a choice of \\"retain/do not retain\\". Hunt was retained by Montana voters with 68.2 percent of the vote (232,640 votes). Hunt was widely perceived as a liberal on a court with a strong conservative majority in his first term, when he was often in minority. Although he did not often write decisions, Justice Hunt was often assigned the task of writing decisions when he voted with the majority. In the 1990s, the court gained a liberal majority. Former law clerks said that Hunt used the gray areas of the law to protect individuals, the powerless, the poor, and minorities. Hunt described his judicial philosophy differently: \\"I'm a liberal and you guys call me a liberal. I think a liberal is a person who has had a lot of experience and is not bound by what happened in the past, but understands the past.\\" While Hunt said judges had to interpret the law as written, he also emphasized that laws are enforced in the real world. Total objectivity by judges was not possible, and the best judges were those with extensive experiences. Montana Supreme Court Associate Justice Terry N. Trieweiler noted that Hunt wrote several important decisions regarding employer accountability in worker injury cases, consumers' rights, environmental law, and civil liberties. Associate Justice Jim Regnier observed that Hunt was widely praised in the legal community for acting as a mentor to young attorneys while an associate justice. The 77-year-old Hunt declined to seek reelection in 2000, and retired from the Montana Supreme Court. He was succeeded by Patricia O'Brien Cotter. Awards and honors The Montana Trial Lawyers Association gave Hunt three awards. The first was two were its Public Service and Career Achievement awards, given in 2000, and the third was its Citizens Award, presented in 2007. Hunt received the Jeannette Rankin Public Service Award from the Montana chapter of the ACLU in 2009. In 2003, William E. Hunt was inducted into the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School Hall of Honor. Death and personal life =Personal life= William E. Hunt, Sr. was a lifelong Catholic. Hunt married Mary V. Fassler of Melrose, Montana, on August 25, 1952. She was a registered nurse who had recently graduated from the St. Patrick School of Nursing at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula. She died of natural causes on December 29, 2009. The Hunts had five children: Joseph, James, Katherine, Patricia, and William E. Jr. Joe Hunt died of cancer in 1998. =Death= William E. Hunt suffered from frail health in the last several years of his life, and lived at the Rocky Mountain Care Center nursing home in Helena after 2012. He died there of natural causes on February 16, 2016. His funeral was held at the Cathedral of Saint Helena in Helena, Montana, and he was interred at Resurrection Cemetery outside the city.

It is approximately long and flows through Lower Saucon Township and Bethlehem. The watershed of the creek has an area of . A reach of the creek is designated as an impaired waterbody. However, the upper reaches are relatively unimpacted by development and the wetlands at its headwaters are designated as Exceptional Value and are home to numerous amphibians. The creek is also inhabited by wild trout. Pioneers reached the area in the vicinity of East Branch Saucon Creek as early as the 1730s. More recently, Bethlehem Steel had a property in the watershed. A number of bridges have also been constructed over the creek, and it once had a dam, but it was removed for safety reasons. Course East Branch Saucon Creek begins in a pond in Lower Saucon Township near the Northampton/Bucks county line. It flows northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning north and passing through a pond. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek turns west for a few tenths of a mile before turning north, passing between Focht Hill and Granite Hill. It then turns north-northeast for several tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from the left and turning east-northeast. The creek then turns north for a short distance, receiving an unnamed tributary from the right before turning west-northwest and receiving another unnamed tributary from the right. It then heads in a westerly direction for several tenths of a mile before crossing Interstate 78 and entering Bethlehem, where it receives another unnamed tributary from the right. Here, the creek continues flowing west, entering a deep, very narrow valley and passing near several railroad lines. It then turns west-northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning north for several tenths of a mile. At this point it receives an unnamed tributary from the right and passes by the southwestern corner of Green Hill before turning west and reaching its confluence with Saucon Creek. East Branch Saucon Creek joins Saucon Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology A reach of East Branch Saucon Creek is designated as an impaired waterbody. The cause of impairment is unknown, and probable sources include industrial point source discharge and urban runoff/storm sewers. The sediment load in East Branch Saucon Creek has been found to be 3861 tons per year at the creek's mouth and 2289 tons per year further upstream, at the Northampton Sportsman's Club. Two sites in the upper reaches of the creek's watershed had sediment loads of 511 and 108 tons per year. East Branch Saucon Creek has relatively warm water. In June 2000, the water temperature was measured to be while the air temperature was only . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of East Branch Saucon Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is above sea level. There are extensive wetlands at the headwaters of East Branch Saucon Creek. This area contains a \\"mosaic\\" of sprigs, seeps, streamlets, forested wetlands, and upland forests. There are also vernal pools and several man-made ponds there. A natural area on Granite Hill is in the vicinity of the creek. There is a flat-bottomed valley at the headwaters of the creek. It has been suggested that during the Illinoisan glaciation, ice in the Saucon Valley pushed into this part of the valley, carrying with it a large amount of cobbles from the Silurian and Devonian periods. The headwaters of East Branch Saucon Creek are located in the Swabia Hills. There are a number of springs and seeps in the headwaters of the creek. Other features in the watershed of East Branch Saucon Creek include Saucon Pond, Campbell Pond and Martin Lake, and a volunteer fire company. When constructing Interstate 78, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation constructed a fish passage under a long culvert on East Branch Saucon Creek as well as installing riprap to create holding water. Watershed The watershed of East Branch Saucon Creek has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hellertown. The creek's mouth is located at Shimersville. Most of the watershed of East Branch Saucon Creek is in Lower Saucon Township, but substantial areas are also in the city of Bethlehem, as well as in Williams Township, Bucks County. A small corner of the watershed is also in Hellertown. East Branch Saucon Creek passes through former Bethlehem Steel property north of Interstate 78. In this area, the creek's greenway provides little protection for it. However, most of the land in the vicinity of the creek south of Interstate 78 is densely forested with some rural residential development. The creek is located near Pennsylvania Highlands scenic greenway. History and recreation East Branch Saucon Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1173769. The creek is also known as Laubachs Creek. This variant name appears in Place Names of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, by James and Linda Wright, created in 1988. In 1735, Hans Georg Hertzell, a pioneer in Lower Saucon Township, was granted a warrant for surveying near East Branch Saucon Creek. He and his family settled there and he named this tract of land \\"Partnership\\". However, the land was not officially surveyed until Nicholas Scull did so in 1737. In the vicinity of the creek, there is a historic barn dating to the 1830s with many unusual features. A sawmill was historically located on the creek. A concrete stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2001 was built over East Branch Saucon Creek in 1930. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying the same road over the creek was built in 1934. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2006 was built over the creek in 1956. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation made plans to paint a bridge carrying Raubsville Road over the creek in Lower Saucon Township. Around 2000, a number of vernal ponds on the south side of East Branch Saucon Creek were destroyed by site preparation for a new residential development. Historically, the Lower Saucon Sportsmens Association Dam was on the creek, but it was removed for safety reasons. East Branch Saucon Creek may be navigable by canoe, though the creek is not commonly used for this purpose. The creek was described in A. Joseph Armstrong's book Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams as a \\"nice-looking stream\\". An East Branch Saucon Creek County Park was proposed in the 1970s. Biology In 2000, A. Joseph Armstrong observed in that there were no trout in East Branch Saucon Creek, and he doubted there would ever be. However, as of 2016, wild trout naturally reproduce in Saucon Creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. In 2003, areas along East Branch Saucon Creek in Lower Saucon Township were identified to be in need of a riparian buffer. However, the headwaters are rich in biodiversity. There are habitats for numerous amphibians, including wood frogs and spring peepers. There are several types of wetland communities at the creek's headwaters, including \\"small sedge-dominated wetland openings\\" and wooded swamps with skunk cabbage on the ground. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection considers these wetlands to be Exceptional Value due to the presence of wild trout in the creek.

Government officials confirmed at least 49 people were killed in the hours-long assault, while 63 others were injured. By March 13 the unconfirmed death toll had surpassed 100, with an unknown number injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed to have carried out the attack, but officials suspected the Haqqani network instead. Attack At about 09:00 local time, a suicide bomber destroyed the back entrance to the hospital, located in Kabul's affluent Wazir Akbar Khan district, home to the Presidential Palace and Hamid Karzai International Airport. At least five attackers dressed as medical staff then entered the building and began going from floor to floor, paying particular attention to the VIP wing where an army general and a former minister's relative were reported to be. The militants appeared to fire indiscriminately, with a witness describing a gunman \\"wearing a white coat and holding a Kalashnikov [opened] fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors.\\" Subsequent reports spoke of a savage attack, with the militants stabbing bed-ridden patients, throwing grenades into crowded wards, and shooting people in the head from pointblank range, including women and children. The attackers occupied the hospital for about seven hours until military forces were deployed via the hospital's roof and were successful in neutralizing them. Norwegian Marinejegerkommandoen special forces stationed in Kabul supported the Afghan operation, though they did not take part in the fighting. Days after the assault reports emerged that suggested a simultaneous assault, with insiders involved as well. Surviving staff described two interns in their 20s who had worked in the hospital for months as participants in the attack, with one being the initial suicide bomber. Afghan sources later confirmed the reports, with Defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish saying that \\"the attack was carried out from both outside and inside [...] this could not have been possible without the help of people inside.\\" According to Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Dawlat Waziri in a statement made shortly after the hospital had been cleared of attackers, about thirty people had been killed and fifty injured. On 9 March, Salim Rassouli, director of the Kabul hospital network, said that the death toll has risen to 49, with 63 wounded. By March 13 numerous sources, including survivors and members of the Afghan security forces, were reporting that the overall death toll and the number of militants involved was significantly higher than initially thought, with over 100 killed and scores more injured. Aftermath The Amaq News Agency, affiliated with the Islamic State, distributed images of an attacker and victims, which the SITE Intelligence Group, a monitor of online activity from terrorist groups, said was the organization's way of taking responsibility for the attack. Government official, however, were quick to cast doubt on those claims, citing the complexity of the assault, as well as the fact that two floors containing Taliban patients were specifically not targeted. Survivors reported the attackers were in phone contact with someone named Mullah Sahib, and also shouted \\"Long live Taliban\\" in Pashto. Suspicion fell on the Haqqani network, which has staged similar elaborate attacks in the past. = Reactions = Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah both made statements condemning the attack, as did the United Nations. From the United States, Army General John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of the US Forces in Afghanistan, condemned the attack as an \\"unspeakable crime,\\" and praised security forces for their swift response, saying they deserved \\"our highest praise and respect.\\" The United States Embassy in Kabul said, \\"Targeting a medical facility providing care for the brave Afghans working to protect their fellow citizens has no possible justification in any religion or creed.\\"  See also  * 2008 bombing of Indian embassy in Kabul, organized by the Haqqani network * Camp Chapman attack, a 2009 insider incident which killed 9 people, including 7 CIA agents * September 2011 Kabul attack, which targeted the U.S. Embassy in Wazir Akbar Khan district  References  2017 murders in Afghanistan Suicide bombings in 2017 Attacks on hospitals Islamic terrorist incidents in 2017 Mass murder in Afghanistan Mass murder in Kabul Mass murder in 2017 March 2017 crimes in Asia Suicide bombings in Afghanistan Terrorist incidents in Kabul Terrorist incidents in Afghanistan in 2017 2017 in Kabul Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Attacks on buildings and structures in Afghanistan Building bombings in Afghanistan ","title":"March 2017 Kabul attack"},{"id":"53428845","text":"Jean-Fran√ßois Parenteau is a politician in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark. Description Redux is a small library with a simple, limited API designed to be a predictable container for application state. It operates in a similar fashion to a reducing function, a functional programming concept. It is influenced by the functional programming language Elm.  History  Redux was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark in 2015. Abramov began writing the first Redux implementation while preparing for a conference talk at React Europe on hot reloading. Abramov remarks, \\"I was trying to make a proof of concept of Flux where I could change the logic. And it would let me time travel. And it would let me reapply the future actions on the code change.\\" Abramov was struck by the similarity of the Flux pattern with a reducing function. \\"I was thinking about Flux as a reduce operation over time... your stores, they accumulate state in response to these actions. I was thinking of taking this further. What if your Flux store was not a store but a reducer function?\\" Abramov reached out to Andrew Clark (author of the Flux implementation Flummox) as a collaborator. Among other things, he credits Clark with making the Redux ecosystem of tools possible, helping to come up with a coherent API, implementing extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. In February 2019, useReducer was introduced as a React hook in the 16.8 release. It provides an API that is consistent with Redux, enabling developers to create Redux-like stores that are local to component states.React v16.8: The One with Hooks References External links GitHub JavaScript libraries Computer-related introductions in 2015 Free and open-source software ","title":"Redux (JavaScript library)"},{"id":"53428869","text":"Monument commemorating Long's flight in Torquay, Victoria, erected 1926.

The lake was used as a halting place for wagon travelers who were trekking the historic Mormon Emigrant trail during the Gold Rush. The lake has been used by many different groups of people including Native Americans, 49ers, and resort owners so it is known by a few different names. The variant names are clear lake, summit lake, and twin lakes. Currently, Caples lake is a reservoir being used for water and recreation. Woods creek and Emigrant creek both flow into Caples lake which drains into Caples creek. Caples creek meets up with the South Fork of the American River. Caples lake is owned by the El Dorado Irrigation District (EID) who is using it as part of the hydroelectric project 184 system.  EL Dorado Irrigation District Management  The EID obtained the license for project 184 (the Eldorado hydroelectric project) in 2006 and it had requirements that the EID monitor flows, recreation, and environmental conditions within their system. The EID also manages the recreational facilities at Caples lake such as the boat launch, day use areas, and bathrooms with the help of the Eldorado National Forest as part of the license agreement. The project 184 system has four reservoirs including Caples lake, a diversion dam along the South Fork of the American River, and a hydropower facility located at Forbay reservoir. The water that gets diverted goes through the El Dorado Canal which brings water to Forbay reservoir. That water is used to generate power at the El Dorado Powerhouse for Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;) and provides some consumptive water for the El Dorado Irrigation District.  History  The Washoe Indians occupied the area before the gold rush attracted many new settlers. The Washoe people referred to Caples lake as Twin lakes because the area was historically an open meadow with two shallow lakes that they were able to fish, hunt, and forage around. The next person to occupy the area was Dr. James Caples, who passed by the lake in 1849 on his trek to the gold country. He later returned and bought the area that is now Caples lake to raise cattle and to set up a trading post for travelers that was around for thirty years. The way-station could only be opened up during the summer months due to its high elevation but it still served as a very important stop for 49ers, which is why the lake was named after Dr. Caples. Caples dam was originally constructed in 1922 by damming up Caples creek. After the gold rush ended, the way-station transitioned into a resort for travelers. A man named Ray Koenig was the first to construct a resort in 1948, however, he owned it before highway 88 was built so he had to ski all the way from highway 50 to set up the resort each year. Since Koenig there have been several owners of the resort who made improvements to the lodging and dam and tried to keep it running during the winter. The opening of Kirkwood ski resort in 1972 allowed highway 88 to remain open as a winter travel route, making it easier for the resort to remain open year-round. The Caples lake resort is currently owned by the Voss family who keep it open during the winter months.  Recreation  Caples lake is found in the Eldorado National Forest so there are a variety of different recreational opportunities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing within close proximity. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has reports of stocking Caples lake with fish for recreational fishing dating back to 1930. Currently, the regulations for Caples lake state that fishermen are only allowed to take home five trout that are a minimum of ten inches each. Both the CDFW and the EID stock Caples lake with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Caples lake also supports a few non-stocked species such as the Lahontan redsides (Richardsonius egregius), the tui chub (Gila bicolor), and the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). There is year-round fishing at Caples lake, boat access in the summer and ice-fishing in the winter. There are also many trailheads located nearby Caples Lake that enter into the Mokelumne Wilderness. The names of the trailheads are lake margaret trailhead, meiss lake trailhead, thunder mountain trailhead, frog lake/roundtop trailhead, shealor lake trailhead. The access for these trailheads are along Highway 88 which is also how you access Caples lake.

The book is about Chast's parents in their final years. Her father, George, died at the age of 95 and her mother, Elizabeth, who worked as an assistant elementary school principal, died at the age of 97. The author derived the book's title from her parents' refusal to discuss their advancing years and infirmities. Chast's cartoons have appeared in The New Yorker magazine since 1978. The book was appreciated for showcasing Chast's talent as cartoonist and storyteller. It received several awards and was a number 1 New York Times Bestseller.  Plot  Author Roz Chast at the 2007 Texas Book Festival The book's storyline, spanning an eight-year period from 2001 to 2009, concerns Roz Chast's parents living in Brooklyn. The book describes various interactions between Chast and her parents. Chast, who lives in Connecticut, often used to visit her parents, calling their home \\"a hoarder's paradise\\".

Review and reception  Alex Witchelmay of The New York Times described the book as \\"beautiful, deeply felt\\" and \\"scorchingly honest\\". Rachel Cooke wrote in The Guardian that the book is \\"honest, plangent and thoroughly ghoulish. But it's also hysterical\\". The editorial cartoonist of The Boston Globe, Dan Wasserman, reviewed the book, calling it \\"a touching, unflinching, darkly hilarious account\\" which \\"serves as a strange sort of self-help guide for those stumbling through the last years of their parents' lives\\". Tahneer Oksman of the Jewish Book Council wrote that Chast \\"incorporates her familiarly whimsical humor alongside prose-heavy pages detailing the grief and guilt\\". Felice Aull, Adjunct Associate Professor at New York University School of Medicine, described \\"The Wheel of Doom\\" as \\"one of the most ambitious renderings\\". Paul Gravett of The Independent appreciated the book for tackling \\"a dark, tricky subject\\" and called it \\"a new direction for the graphic novel with a reflection on the sad, inevitable end\\".  Awards  In 2014, the book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in the Autobiography/Memoir section. The book also won the inaugural Kirkus Prize in non-fiction category presented by Kirkus Reviews in 2014 which has a cash remuneration of $50,000.

Overview A salumeria in Milan, Italy in 1930. Poultry products are hanging in front of the store. A salumeria is a food purveyor and retail store that produces and sells salumi, which are meat products of Italian origin that includes sausages, cold cuts and other foods predominantly made from pork. Some salumerias also produce some beef-based products, such as bresaola, a salted beef product, and purvey other food products such as pasta, cheese, preserved foods, anchovies, salt cod, wines, bread and cooked meats. Some modern salumerias only sell salumi and related products, while not producing products on-premises. Some salumerias also operate sit-down restaurants, such as Sorriso Italian Salumeria in Queens, New York City. Salumeria Biellese is another salumeria in New York City that is well-known, and was established in 1925. History The salumeria originated in Italy and dates to the Middle Ages. Historically, salumerias in Bologna, Italy did not produce their own meats. They selected meats and other products such as pasta, olives and cheeses from local purveyors. These purveyors worked in a guild system that was created by the signori in Bologna, the city's rulers, in a system that dates to the Middle Ages. Purveyors for salumeria products included the salaroli, which controlled the salt industry, who salted the pork, which was then shipped to the lardaioli, a guild that sold the pork. The lardaioli also produced soap and candles from the pork lard they would receive. This guild system was eliminated by Napol√©on Bonaparte around the time of the turn of the 19th century.

Background  Mary Kawennatakie Adams, a hereditary member of the Mohawk wolf clan, was born on Cornwall Island at Akwesasne on the Mohawk Nation, which straddles the New York/Canadian border. She was born in Ontario, Canada. Her Mohawk name Kawennatakie means \\"approaching voice.\\" She had no formal education after age 16 and did not learn English until well into adulthood.  Basket making  Adams' childhood was spent close to her mother and grandmother. At the age of 6, Adams learned from her mother how to process black ash splints and sweetgrass and weave baskets. When she was 10 years old, her mother died, and her father left the reserve to seek employment as an iron worker. Initially, Adams was locally trading her baskets for needed food and other items, but later learned that trading the baskets for cigarettes and then selling the cigarettes brought in more money. In this way she was able to support herself and her brother. Her brother helped by felling the ash so she could prepare the wood. Adams married at the age of 17. She had 12 children, she supported her family with her baskets. Her family was involved in each step (cutting, pounding, cleaning, shaving, braiding) of this endeavor. By the time she was in her early 50s, she was financially independent. She was then able to make baskets that were \\"imaginative and distinctive\\"rather than utilitarian. Later, she taught basket making on the Mohawk Reserve at Akwesasne. She traveled widely to give demonstrations of Mohawk basket making. Adams' duel cultural influences from being Mohawk and Roman Catholic is, in the words of scholar Olivia Thornburn, \\"interwoven with her splint ash and sweet grass baskets.\\" She was active in St. Regis Catholic Church. M√©tis scholar Sherry Farrell Racette noted Adam's \\"skilled execution\\" in a unique stitch known as the \\"bird-mouth\\" stitch, and her skill in \\"texture created by the innovative application of tiny, miniature baskets.\\" In 1980, Adams presented Pope John Paul II at the Vatican with a basket specially made to honor the beatification of now St. Kateri Tekakwitha, a noted 17th-century Mohawk-Algonquian woman. Thornburn described the design of this basket, known as the Pope Basket, as \\"highly architectural and almost baroque. . .\\"The design of the basket lid may reflect the papal zucchetto, or skullcap. Also, the shape of the basket is similar to Michelangelo's grand dome of St. Peter's Basilica.\\" The design for this basket came to Adam's in a dream. A replica of the basket, also made by Adams, is at the Smithsonian. During her life, she produced more than 25,000 baskets. In 1997, she received an award for excellence in Iroquois art from the Iroquois Indian Museum. Adams was included in the 1998 exhibition Crossing the Threshold, focusing on women artists, at the Bernice Steinbaum Gallery. Family Mary Adams was married in 1934. The couple had twelve children. Collections Adams's work is in the permanent collections of the Iroquois Indian Museum in New York, the Thunder Bay Art Gallery, the New York State Governor's Collection of Art in Albany and the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC. Exhibitions Her work was exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution; Museum at the University at Albany, SUNY; the Heard Museum; the National Museum of the American Indian; the Pitt Rivers Museum, The Minneapolis Institute of Art, among other venues. Death Adams continued to make baskets through out her life. At the time of her death, even with failing eyesight, she was braiding sweet grass for her daughter Trudy, who was also making baskets. In 1999, Mary Adams died peacefully at her home in Snye, Quebec surrounded by her loving family.

Its leader and mayoral candidate was Michel Br√ªl√©, a publisher, author, and singer familiar in Quebec media circles. A 2013 news article described him as the second largest publisher in Quebec in terms of sales; one of his companies, √âditions les Intouchables, focused on the publication of children's books.

Br√ªl√© published a book in 2009 entitled Anglaid which was focused on imperialism and ethnocentrism in English culture, and he was known for making controversial statements such as, \\"English is not a beautiful language.\\" He acknowledged that he was unlikely to win much support from Montreal's anglophone community.

The book contains letters written to the author's family and friends during 1971-1977. Introduction The book is considered among the group of Shariati‚Äôs books containing his strictly personal writings, and is not included among his lectures. The book is a collection of twenty-nine letters. The contents of the book were written to the author's father, wife, children, close friends and other acquaintances between the years 1971-1977. The book also contains a public lecture, a piece addressed to God, his two last wills and testaments and an incomplete note. Among these letters, approximately twelve are addressed to Ihsan, his son. Three letters are addressed to his father, three to his wife, two to 'Mr. Minach', two to an unknown woman, one letter to his daughters, one letter to Mr. HujjatI-i Kirmani, one letter to \\"the friends at Irshad,\\" one letter to a brother, one letter to a friend, and one letter to \\"an unknown\\". The book reveals the political and mystical compasses of Shariati in such a way that it is possible to observe his opinions on different social, political and mystical issues. In a letter to his son, he considers several concepts including love, justice and freedom. Shariati is shown to believe that these three elements are strongly linked. Attitude Indeed, Shariati tried to produce a new attitude and a commentary of Ijtihad and a symbolic interpretation of revelation)). Furthermore, he presented consensus or Ijma and reason as foundations of Ijtihad making use of this new attitude. He insisted on the impoTaghriirf the Taghriir and the method of Muhammad‚Äôs behavior compared to action and saying. He believed that the aspect of the prophet‚Äôs behavior is more sensible, immortal and general. However, he proposed to use ‚Äúscience and time‚Äù in place of ‚Äúreason and consensus‚Äù. He believed that science could help the jurisprudence. Part of text In a letter dated the last night of the year 1976, and written on the last pages of KullTyat-Shams Tabrizi, Shariati recounts how twice R√ºmI's Mathnaw√Ø had saved his life. The case of the first incident is particularly interesting since it shows a direct influence of Sufism on Shariati: And Mawlaw√Øi twice saved me from dying: the first was the years of adolescence [the years of] psychological crisis. Because I had started reading primarily with the works of (Maurice] Maeterlinck. And [considering] those dubious and aimless thoughts which maddened a genius like him, it is obvious what they would do to the mind of a twelve-year-old student of the sixth grade. This mental dispersion became stormier and more maddening in the world of Sufism that had strongly attracted me (in my state of] immaturity.(Ali Shariati, Ba Mukhatabh√¢-yi Ashna, p. 99) References Books by Ali Shariati Persian books Iranian books ","title":"Ba Mukhatabhaye Ashna"},{"id":"53429382","text":"115 South African Infantry Battalion was a motorised infantry unit of the South African Army.

It is also the administrative center of the village council of Shapkino. Geography The village of Shapkino is located in the southern part of the Tambov region, near the confluence of the Volochila river into the river Vorona. Population The population of the Shapkino is 1,791 people (2002). History The village was founded as a rural locality (stanitsa). Originally named Isapova, it has been known as Shapkino since the 1820s. The first historical mention of the village came in 1707. The Landratskoy Census of 1710 listed its population at 78 people. In 1816, the village contained 2,966 people. In 1911 it was listed as having a population of 7,220 people. In the years 1938-1956 Shapkino served as the administrative center of the Shapkino Center district. On December 27, 2011, the Shapkino village council unanimously approved the Shabkino village coat of arms. An idea for the coat of arms stems from the historical location of the Shakino village which is situated at the confluence of two rivers. As a result, a blue fork-shaped cross symbolizes the confluence of Vorona and Isap. Further, one can see images of a horse and willow branch on a yellow background. The horse symbolizes the power and strength of Shapkino people, while the willow branch represents the influence of Mordovian culture on Shapkino's history. The etymology of the word \\"Isap\\" comes two words: from the Mordovian \\"Isa\\" (willow) and the ending \\"ap\\" which meant \\"water, river\\" in many languages. Next, dressed in golden robe and armed with a fiery sword and shield, the Holy Archangel Michael represents the Russian army and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of evil. Finally, the red, blue, and yellow colors of the coat of arms symbolize the Kazak heritage of the region. The first residents of the village were serving Cossacks and boyar children. The black color represents the wealth of the Shapkino land. Places of interest Museum in Village Shapkino, Tambov region The Shapkino Local History Museum \\"Istoki\\" is located on the 180 sq.m. of the former Shapkino Volost Administration's building. This nineteenth-century house is the only surviving administrative wooden building in the Tambov region. One of the museum rooms is furnished in a rustic style to demonstrate peasant life. Visitors will see old household items, peasant arts and crafts exhibits, as well as nineteenth- and twentieth- century coins, photographs, furniture, and clothes. In addition, the museum has a section that relays the early days of the Shapkino village and its residents. A special place is devoted to the lacework of tablecloths and towels by local masters of the late nineteenth -and early twentieth centuries. Finally, the archaeological section includes exhibits collected during excavations in the village of Shapkino. Sport In early November of each year, the marathon Muchkap-Shapkino-Lubol passes through the streets of the village, over a total distance of 42 kilometers and 195 meters. The same day, a smaller race of 1,055 meters takes place over meters for children. Each year, marathon participants assist in the planting of trees on the avenue on which the race follows until a total of 42,195 trees are planted there. In recent years, local boxing has experienced a dynamic increase in popularity in the village of Shapkino. Young men from the Muchkapsky District regularly participate in tournaments in Russian National and Central Federal District. Shapkino is the venue for the All-Russia boxing tournament. The tournament occurs annually on the first Saturday and Sunday of February. A second boxing tournament is held in September. Historically, Shapkino was represented by a team participating in the first national tournament of Lapta, a type of Russian baseball. The tournament took place in September, 1957 in the village of Dinskaya, Krasnodar Krai district Plastunovskoy.

As a self-identified queer Tejana, Lim√≥n's writing focuses on the queer Latinx experience in the Southwestern United States. Life and career Though Lim√≥n has been writing since 1985, she has been employed in the fields of domestic violence and public health for over three decades. As a member of allgo, an Austin-based queer Latinx organization, she worked to assist other queer people of color overcome the oppression they encountered daily. With other members of allgo in 1989, Lim√≥n founded Informe-SIDA, a non-profit fighting HIV/AIDS in communities of color in the Austin area. Lim√≥n is currently employed as the Prevention Coordinator at the Texas Council on Family Violence. Literary themes Much of Lim√≥n's work is defined by her identity as a queer Tejana raised in a working-class household. Consequently, themes of navigating multiple cultural identities, intersecting layers of oppression, and the results of education and social mobility are recurring themes in her writing. Her short story \\"Santiago\\" focuses on a small moment in the relationship between a young Chicana and her Mexican father. Set in the desert near Alameda, California, the eponymous Santiago muses over his desire for a new car as he waits for his daughter to help him fix his blown out tire. As she pulls in, Lim√≥n notes her \\"outfit that was as far away from Mexican as she could afford,\\". As they drive to a nearby gas station, Dulce remembers the bits of paint that as a child she would pick off of Santiago's arms. The juxtaposition of Dulce's American clothing, implied to be a result of her college education, and Santiago's paint-flecked arms serve to highlight cultural and class divides between the two. Though she harbors resentment towards her father for leaving her mother and their family, she eventually recalls the selflessness that protected her from harm when they were together. Santiago jokes about being buried in his broken-down car, the nicest car he had ever owned, and Dulce asks him not to joke about such things. Dulce's words represent her respect for her father and his working- class roots, and the two come to a silent understanding before he drives away.

He was born in L∆∞u Gia village in Th√°i B√¨nh province.  History  = Assisting the L√Ω Prince = Not much is known about T√¥ Trung T·ª´'s past, other than that he is the brother- in-law of Tr·∫ßn L√Ω, who married his sister T√¥ Phu Nh√¢n, and that he was a relative of T√¥ Hi·∫øn Th√†nh, who was one of the most prominent mandarins at the time during the L√Ω dynasty. He was also the uncle of several prominent members of the Tr·∫ßn clan, such as the Marquis Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung who was the last empress of the L√Ω dynasty and Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a who was the head of the Tr·∫ßn clan and whose son, Tr·∫ßn C·∫£nh would later become the first emperor of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty. Prior to the incident of Qu√°ch B·ªëc's rebellion, where general Qu√°ch B·ªëc ousted the emperor L√Ω Cao T√¥ng in 1209, which marked the beginning of the downfall of the L√Ω dynasty, T√¥ Trung T·ª´ was a mandarin in the royal court and was acquainted with the emperor L√Ω Cao T√¥ng and his son L√Ω Hu·ªá T√¥ng, also known by his birth name L√Ω S·∫£m, the penultimate ruler of the L√Ω dynasty. The reign of Emperor L√Ω Cao T√¥ng was a time of chaos, confusion and discord, arousing much discontent from the general populace. Then, in 1209, Emperor Cao T√¥ng was suggested by Vietnamese official Ph·∫°m Du to kill Ph·∫°m B·ªânh Di, who was a rival official of Ph·∫°m Du. Emperor Cao T√¥ng toke Du's advice and ordered the killing of B·ªânh Di. Qu√°ch B·ªëc, who was a general under B·ªânh Di went to avenge his master as a result and thus attacked the capital, temporarily installing L√Ω Th·∫ßm as the emperor. As a result, Emperor Cao T√¥ng fled to Quy Ho√°, while prince L√Ω S·∫£m, his mother and his two younger sisters fled to H·∫£i ·∫§p in Th√°i B√¨nh province, which was under Tr·∫ßn L√Ω's governance. Listening to the advice of Ph·∫°m Ngu, Tr·∫ßn L√Ω and T√¥ Trung T·ª´ went to meet Prince S·∫£m to discuss the matter of making L√Ω Th·∫ßm the king. Prince S·∫£m then returned to the village of L∆∞u Gia, T√¥ Trung T·ª´'s native town, where he then met the daughter of Tr·∫ßn L√Ω, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung, and upon being mesmerized by her beauty, took her as his wife. Afterwards, Tr·∫ßn L√Ω was appointed to the title of \\"Minh T·ª±\\", Ph·∫°m Ngu was appointed as the minister of justice and T√¥ Trung T·ª´ as the Commander of Anterior Citadel. After hearing the news that Prince S·∫£m had established his own court with Tr·∫ßn L√Ω, T√¥ Trung T·ª´ and Ph·∫°m Ngu, Emperor L√Ω Cao T√¥ng, still residing in Quy Ho√°, decided to send Ph·∫°m Du as a messenger to contact S·∫£m and his court, alongside the ƒêo√†n brothers (ƒêo√†n Th∆∞·ª£ng, ƒêo√†n VƒÉn L√¥i). However, Ph·∫°m Du, who was in a relationship with the princess Thi√™n C·ª±c would miss the arranged meeting, leaving only the ƒêo√†n's to arrive. When Du went on the boat to meet the ƒêo√†n's, he was ambushed as he arrived towards Ma L√£ng and was captured and killed by Nguy·ªÖn N·∫≠u and Nguy·ªÖn N·∫£i, the leaders of B·∫Øc Giang, alongside their army. At around that time, Tr·∫ßn L√Ω and T√¥ Trung T·ª´ brought forth their army and crushed the rebellion of Qu√°ch B·ªëc in order to work with the L√Ω royalty. At the end of 1209, the rebellion of Qu√°ch B·ªëc was flattened, but Tr·∫ßn L√Ω was killed during the battle. T√¥ Trung T·ª´, having survived and successfully crushing the rebellion, was welcomed to Emperor Cao T√¥ng's palace for a meeting. Because Ph·∫°m Du was now dead, and due to Trung T·ª´'s increasing influence, Cao T√¥ng was now forced to increasingly rely on Trung T·ª´. = Seizing control over the L√Ω Dynasty =  Ascension within the Royal Court  T√¥ Trung T·ª´ escorted Emperor Cao T√¥ng to the capital city while Prince S·∫£m was still at H·∫£i ·∫§p along with Tr·∫ßn L√Ω's son's Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a and Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh, due to Qu√°ch B·ªëc's prior rebellion. At this point, Trung T·ª´ wanted to seize all the power to himself, so he first decided to separate Prince L√Ω S·∫£m away from the Tr·∫ßn sons. At the beginning of 1210, King Cao T√¥ng fell seriously ill, so the king wanted to welcome his son Prince S·∫£m to the throne. At this point, T√¥ Trung T·ª´ staged a fake attack using a pretentious army in order to quell the supposed rebels at Kho√°i Ch√¢u, only to come to H·∫£i ·∫§p to seize the prince. Not long afterwards, Cao T√¥ng sent his officer ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng to come and pick up Prince S·∫£m. At the end of 1210, Emperor L√Ω Cao T√¥ng finally succumbed and died from his illness, but before dying, he commissioned Master ƒê·ªó K√≠nh Tu to look after Prince S·∫£m. L√Ω S·∫£m then ascended to the throne after his father's death and took on the title of L√Ω Hu·ªá T√¥ng, but to much surprise, it was not ƒê·ªó K√≠nh Tu but T√¥ Trung T·ª´ instead who had become the ruler of the court and thus was the closest one to the now emperor Hu·ªá T√¥ng. After ascending to the throne, Hu·ªá T√¥ng asked that Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung be his wife, but her brother, Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh did not consent. By this time, T√¥ Trung T·ª´ had won over the emperor away from the Tr·∫ßn clan should any contradictions or disputes arise with T·ª± Kh√°nh.  Rise to Power in L√Ω Dynasty  At this point, Emperor Hu·ªá T√¥ng, now seeing that Trung T·ª´ had seized considerable power within the court, decided to send his officer ƒê·ªó K√≠nh Tu to seek out and battle him. In December 1210, the Empress along with ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng's group captured K√≠nh Tu and handed him over to Trung T·ª´. K√≠nh Tu was later drowned by Trung T·ª´ and was found dead near ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng. Afterwards, the ranking officers of the L√Ω dynasty continued to plot against the usurper T√¥ Trung T·ª´. Shortly thereafter, Trung T·ª´ heard of news from his officers that ƒê·ªó Th·∫ø Quy, Ph√≠ Li·ªát, and ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng were planning to dispatch their troops to fight against him, so he set out his forces to take down those people first. However, before he was about to launch his attack, Trung T·ª´ realized that his army was smaller than ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng's and Ph√≠ Li·ªát's, who had too many soldiers for his forces to handle. Trung T·ª´ thus changed his plans and tried to find a way to deceive the L√Ω generals in order to buy time to increase the size of his army. Trung T·ª´ then sent a messenger to generals ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng and Ph√≠ Li·ªát, saying that: \\"The king has now died, the people are still in grief, why not retreat your soldiers, and then return to the dynasty to consider the plan of joining forces to assist the seventh king, is that not good?\\" ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng and Ph√≠ Li·ªát agreed to the plan and to meet with Trung T·ª´. Since that day was an afternoon, they planned to meet the following morning instead. That night however, T√¥ Trung T·ª´ began to increase his troops more than the day before in preparation to attack and take out Qu·∫£ng and Li·ªát. The following day, ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng and Ph√≠ Li·ªát arrived and waited for the arrival of general Trung T·ª´. Unbeknownst to them however, Trung T·ª´ had secretly came first to T·ª© ƒê·∫°t and ordered his general ƒê√†o Ph√°n to maneuver his army to the right side and build a place for the soldiers to reside in at Sa Tr√¨ and Long Tr√¨, while general Nguy·ªÖn T·ª± and his son-in-law Nguy·ªÖn Ma La were stationed at the troops stronghold, Thi√™n Thu. At that time, while Qu·∫£ng and Li·ªát were eating, Li·ªát heard from Cao Kha that T√¥ Trung T·ª´ had been gathering his soldiers in preparation for an attack; Cao Kha had seen the soldiers throw chopsticks and threateningly raise their weapons as they arrived at Long m√¥n, and he saw ƒê√†o Ph√°n's troops beating their drums and yelling provokingly, signifying aggression. General Qu·∫£ng and Li·ªát were able to drive off ƒê√†o Ph√°n and his forces; ƒê√†o fled away after battle to Thi√™n Thu gate in order to escape Qu·∫£ng and Li·ªát. ƒê√†o Ph√°n then, along with his troops, attacked ƒê·ªó Th·∫ø Quy. Th·∫ø Quy then ran off and hid under the tomb of the now deceased Emperor Cao T√¥ng. T√¥ Trung T·ª´ then came to the scene and was able to capture Th·∫ø Quy, where he then proceeded to order the execution of Th·∫ø Quy at ch·ª£ ƒê√¥ng. Upon hearing the news of Emperor Cao T√¥ng's death, Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh brought forth his troops to T·∫ø Giang (M·ªπ VƒÉn, H∆∞ng Y√™n) and asked for T√¥ Trung T·ª´ to attend the Emperor's funeral, but Trung T·ª´ refused, fearing that Tr·∫ßn T·ª± would burn down the citadel. Tr·∫ßn T·ª± thus was forced to draw his forces back to Thu·∫≠n L∆∞u. In early 1211, Emperor Hu·ªá T√¥ng sent a person to pick up Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung. This time, T·ª± Kh√°nh agreed to send his sister to the court and ordered two military commanders Phan L√¢n and Nguy·ªÖn Ng·∫°nh to act as military escorts. When the troops escorted to ThƒÉng Long, it was time for Trung T·ª´ to clash with ƒê·ªó Qu·∫£ng's troops. Trung T·ª´ and his two generals Phan and Nguy·ªÖn were able to destroy Qu·∫£ng's army. The following month, Qu·∫£ng was captured and beaten by T·ª´'s forces.  Downfall and Death  Though Trung T·ª´ succeeded in disposing of the former royalties of the L√Ω dynasty, his internal insight was doubtful. His \\"B·ªô t∆∞·ªõng\\", or lower ranked general Nguy·ªÖn T·ª± wanted to dispose of his son-in-law, Nguy·ªÖn Ma La and tried to betray Trung T·ª´, which T√¥ Trung later found out when one of Nguy·ªÖn T·ª±'s lower generals reported this news to him. In response, T·ª´ stripped Nguy·ªÖn T·ª± of his military position. T·ª± later fled away to Qu·ªëc Oai where he later ruled as a feudal lord. Things continued to deteriorate for Trung T·ª´; he became fascinated by the beauty of the princess Thi√™n C·ª±c, who was the wife of the Minister V∆∞∆°ng Th∆∞·ª£ng and who had previously had a former relationship with the then deceased Ph·∫°m Du, who had been previously killed by an ambush in Ma L√£ng. One night, on June 6, 1211, T√¥ Trung T·ª´ went to Gia L√¢m alongside the princess Thi√™n C·ª±c, where he was then arrested in an ambush by V∆∞∆°ng Th∆∞·ª£ng and executed thereafter. According to the L√Ω dynasty law, if a man and woman were caught cheating, the husband could kill the rival without being found guilty of a crime. Soon after Trung T·ª´'s death, the city fell into chaos. His son-in-law, Nguy·ªÖn Ma La saw his father- in-law being murdered, so he started to plot with the Tr·∫ßn family; Ma La later asked T·ª± Kh√°nh to use his soldiers in order to quell the chaos within the city. Later, Ma La, along with his wife T√¥ th·ªã (the younger cousin of Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh) boarded a boat headed towards Thu·∫≠n L∆∞u to meet with one of T√¥ Trung T·ª´'s generals, Nguy·ªÖn Trinh, but Trinh then killed Nguy·ªÖn Ma La and had also toke T√¥ th·ªã. T√¥ th·ªã ordered somebody to accuse Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a of masterminding the plot. Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a thus ordered T√¥ th·ªã to seduce and kill Trinh, dealing a devastating blow to Trung T·ª´'s forces. Soon afterwards, T√¥ Trung T·ª´'s forces fell into complete disintegration as a result. While Ma La's body was being pulled out by the troops, and as the entire city vacated, T·ª± Kh√°nh returned the troops back to the capital and then later had a funeral for T√¥ Trung T·ª´ in Ho·∫°ch village. After that, the fighting and hostilities between the warlords grew fiercer until finally Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh was able to defeat the former L√Ω dynasty and toke control of the L√Ω dynasty afterwards.  Legacy  T√¥ Trung T·ª´'s rise to power and downfall in the L√Ω dynasty draws many parallels with and is often compared to the rise and fall of Dong Zhuo in Chinese history; both seized the opportunity of chaos and turmoil within their respective countries in order to seize power, such as the L√Ω dynasty in Trung T·ª´'s case and Dong Zhuo with the Eastern Han dynasty. Both managed to defeat a number of generals and officers who conspired against them, and in both cases, both of their downfalls can be attributed to a woman that they ended up losing their lives for; Princess Thi√™n C·ª±c in T√¥ Trung T·ª´'s case and Diaochan in the case of Dong Zhuo.

A Project Office located in Chatham County, North Carolina, colloquially known as \\"Big Hole\\", came online in the mid 1960s and was described by area residents and persons employed in the construction of the site as being \\"department-store sized\\" with walls \\"several feet thick\\" covered in copper, buried underground on large shock-absorbing springs, constructed with plumbing made out of rubber, and outfitted with tropospheric scatter antennas. The Big Hole Project Office was located on 191 acres of company-owned land surrounded with fencing, CCTV cameras, and steel crash barriers. According to observers of the Project Offices program, the physical description of Big Hole is consistent with the design of other known Project Offices. Big Hole may have been shuttered in 2008; media noted at the time that several convoys of trucks appeared to have moved large amounts of equipment out of the site over the course of several weeks and a company guard force had been withdrawn. =Peters Mountain= A Project Office is located at, or inside, Peters Mountain in Charlottesville, Virginia. According to Albemarle County building permits issued to AT&T;, the site underwent $61 million of updates in 2007. =Short Hill Mountain= A Project Office located on Short Hill Mountain in Virginia was originally constructed in the 1960s and involved excavation of a large section of the mountain.

Worblaufen mixed design elements of both cars: the front was a 22nd and 23rd series Packards (1948‚Äì1950) but the sides lacked the continuous indentation. Instead, the sides were inspired by the Clipper of the 19th and 20th series (1941‚Äì1947). In March 1950 Worblaufen introduced a convertible on a Bentley Mark VI chassis at the Geneva Motor Show. However, the disappearance of traditional automobile manufacturers producing cars in bare chassis form forced Worblaufen, like many other Coachbuilders at around the same time, to give up on the car body production in 1958.

It is currently superintended by the Head of Naval Historical Branch and Naval Historical Library he reports to the Assistant-Chief of the Naval Staff (Policy). History Prior to 1912 responsibility for the management of historical materials was the responsibility of the Admiralty Library later called the Naval Historical Library , its collection transferred to the Naval Historical Branch when it was implemented by First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill during the period he established the Admiralty War Staff before the First World War. He requested the War Staff include a historical section, explaining it should, ‚Äú‚Ä¶be the means of sifting, developing and applying the results of history and experience, and of preserving them as a general stock of reasoned opinion available as an aid and guide for all who are called upon to determine, in peace or war, the naval policy of the country,‚Äù This is still relevant today because the Naval Historical Branch (NHB) continues to function as part of the First Sea Lord‚Äôs Naval Staff, providing advice and support to defence policy and operations and fulfilling a wide range of tasks for both the Government and the public.30px This article contains text from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Development of the Branch The Historical Section was temporarily established before the First World War, but war was declared before it could be properly set up. Information was collected during the war and also after it had finished, the Historical Section comibined and organized materials. It also produced hundreds of classified studies and began a comprehensive history of the maritime war. Budget cuts meant this work was never completed, with negative consequences, but the work achieved despite this was more important, underwriting such measures as the immediate introduction of convoys in 1939. At the outbreak of war the Branch‚Äôs limited staff were assigned purely to collection. However, the first serious German threat to Britain proved to be mines laid in the sea off our coasts. The Vice Chief of the Naval Staff required historical analysis to effectively counter this. When presented with a mass of raw data and on one to interpret it, he immediately had the Branch reconstituted as both a collection and analytical organization.30px This article contains text from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. During the war, the NHB produced hundreds of reports, including immediate Battle Summaries, which allowed rapid improvements in the Royal Navy‚Äôs effectiveness. After the war, these were developed into authoritative histories which incorporated captured German materials and are used extensively with the defence community. They were a basis for the Official Histories and many subsequent works, and NHB is currently publishing them to make them more widely available.30px This article contains text from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Naval Historical Branch Today The Branch continues to provide information and advice across defence in order to improve policy decisions. It does so by supplying a historical perspective and by countering any misconceptions that may have arisen without evidence. Recent work includes papers concerning the debate on effects based warfare and the maritime contribution to dealing with terrorists. This work is complemented by the longer-term analysis of new classified staff histories. Histories in progress include an innovative Four-Nation study of maritime co-operation since the 1990-1991 Gulf War, initiated by the chiefs of Naval Staff in Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. The Branch also works with the fleet headquarters providing war diarist support and historically based training for naval and joint units. Recent examples include the naval war diaries for Operation Telic and a study of the Normandy landings for the Royal Navy‚Äôs Fleet Battle Staff. The Naval Historical Branch works in partnership with Fleet Headquarters in order to ensure records of the Royal Navy‚Äôs wide range of activities are produced, preserved and organized, so that their content is permanently accessible. This is vital for the Branch‚Äôs main business but is also central to legal and compensation issues. These are an increasing aspect of the Branch‚Äôs work and have considerable financial implications. While the Branch does not ‚Äòjudge‚Äô any cases, it does provide a vital expert input, which both assists the early resolution of legitimate claims and helps challenge any which may be more doubtful.

Life Born in Gloucester on 20 May 1830, he was son of Thomas Rougher Russell (1775‚Äì1851), a banker there, and grandson of William Russell of Birmingham; his mother was Mary Skey (1790‚Äì1877), fourth daughter of Col. James Skey. Educated at schools at Bristol and Birmingham, he entered University College, London, in 1847, studying chemistry under Thomas Graham and Alexander William Williamson. For two years a demonstrator at Owens College, Manchester under Edward Frankland (1851‚Äì3), Russell moved on to Heidelberg University, becoming a pupil of Robert Bunsen and graduating Ph.D. in 1855. In 1857 he became assistant to Williamson and carried out researches on the analysis of gases. From 1868 to 1870 he was lecturer in chemistry at the medical school of St. Mary's Hospital, London, and subsequently (1870‚Äì97) held a similar post at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He was (1860‚Äì70) professor of natural philosophy at Bedford College, London, and in later life was chairman of its council. A long-time member of the Chemical Society, Russell became its president 1889‚Äì91. Elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 6 June 1872, he was Bakerian lecturer in 1898.

Works The results of Russell's work on gases were communicated to the Chemical Society, and in Henry Watts's Dictionary of Chemistry he wrote the article on \\"Gas Analysis\\" (1868). He made an extended study of the formation of London's fog.

In these three conflicts, which took place between 1990 and 2015, 682 British soldiers lost their lives. A work by the sculptor Paul Day, the memorial is situated in Victoria Embankment Gardens, between the River Thames and the headquarters of the Ministry of Defence, in the vicinity of monuments commemorating the Second World War and the Korean War. Description The memorial was designed by Paul Day. It consists of two large Portland stone monoliths, weighing . On one side, one stone is inscribed \\"Afghanistan\\" and the other \\"Iraq\\", and on the other side one bears the word \\"duty\\" and the other \\"service\\". A side of each stone is left in a rough condition as a reference to the rocky terrain of Afghanistan and Iraq. The stones are separated by a narrow gap and support between them a thick bronze medallion or tondo sculpted with reliefs that echo the memorial's theme of \\"duty and service\\", depicting members of the armed forces on one side and civilian workers on the other. Unlike similar monuments the memorial carries no names, \\"to be inclusive of all those who contributed\\", and commemorates all who served, civilian and military, not only casualties.  Manufacture  The monument was manufactured by stoneCIRCLE, a stonemason based in Basingstoke. It consists of 10 Jordans Basebed Portland Stone blocks, the largest of which weighs 7000 kg each. The blocks were rough cut and then dry built round a stainless steel frame to allow the edges to be pitched by hand to match the artist's requirements. Once completed they were dismantled and taken to Victoria Embankment Gardens to be reassembled. Background and fundraising On Remembrance Sunday 2014, it was announced that Lord Stirrup, the former Chief of the Defence Staff, would lead the efforts to raise one million pounds to enable a national memorial to the British service personnel who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan to be erected in central London. By March 2015 Stirrup was confident that the full amount needed could be raised and by July 2016 work had begun on the memorial in the Victoria Embankment Gardens. The Sun on Sunday raised ¬£1m for the funding of the memorial, supporting trustees headed by Lord Stirrup.  Unveiling  The memorial was unveiled on 9 March 2017 by Queen Elizabeth II in the presence of the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry of Wales, the Prime Minister Theresa May and her predecessors John Major, Tony Blair and David Cameron, as well as the Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon. The unveiling ceremony was preceded by a drumhead service at Horse Guards Parade led by the Chaplain of the Fleet, the Venerable Ian Wheatley.Queen thanks military who helped bring 'peace' to Iraq and Afghanistan at national memorial service, The Telegraph, 9 March 2017 The ceremony was criticised by some relatives of those who died, because they were not invited, and for the presence of Blair, who led Britain into the Iraq War.

Between 1913 and 1918 she was married to Max Halbe who was killed in the war. Her second marriage, to Joseph Lang, took place in 1941. Therefore, sources covering her political and later activities may identify her as Erna Halbe or as Erna Lang.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Erna Louise Margaretha Demuth was born in Hamburg. Ernst Demuth, her father, was a member of the Furriers' Trades Union and a Social Democratic Party (SPD) official, but he died in 1912. Erna Demuth trained and qualified at the Hamburg Fr√∂bel College as a Kindergarten teacher, and it was in this profession that she worked for five years. Her two elder brothers, like her father, were active in the SPD, and in 1910, two years after the lifting of the constitutional ban on female participation in party politics, she too joined the party. = Marriage and war, imprisonment and bereavement = In 1913 she married the logistics worker and fellow SPD member Max Halbe. Three years later she was a housewife and the mother of a two-year-old daughter. This did not put an end to her political involvement, however. The decision in 1914 of the party leadership to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce for the duration of the war over the issue of Reichstag votes on war funding created internal party ructions from the outset. The intensity of opposition grew as the slaughter on the front lines and austerity on the home front intensified, leading to a party split, generally dated at 1917. By that time Erna Halbe's own campaigning against party support for war credits had become sufficiently forceful to trigger her expulsion from the party in 1916. For the rest of the war she is identified as an activist organiser of the radical left in Hamburg. Her activism included producing and distributing \\"revolutionary leaflets\\", as a result of which, on 27 March 1918, she was given a thirty-month prison sentence for alleged treason (\\"Landesverrat\\"). That same month her husband, who had also been expelled from the party in SPD, and had now been fatally wounded in the fighting, was placed in a battlefield hospital: here he died in June 1918. = Release and revolution = Like many who had been imprisoned for opposition to the war, Erna Halbe was soon released in the context of the revolutions that broke out across Germany in the aftermath of the war. She was a co-founder of the Hamburg branch of the newly emerging Communist Party, and she was the only female member of the 30 person leadership team of the city's Workers' Soviet/Council, which worked closely with the Soldiers' Soviet/Council to create a combined Hamburg Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet/Council under the leadership of a fellow member of the radical left, Heinrich Laufenberg. For a time the Works' and Soldiers' Soviet/Council rook over the functions of the normally powerful Hamburg Parliament (\\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft;\\"). Erna Halbe later recalled that they nevertheless found themselves obliged to continue with the daily administration of the city: \\"The pressing problem was food supplies ... Day and night we sat and debated what to do ... We had been hoping for a real revolution. Everything should be changed, more just ... My own principal speciality was the socio-political questions\\".\\"Das Hauptproblem war die Nahrungsmittelversorgung. (...) Wir haben Tag und Nacht gesessen und beraten, was machen wir (...). Wir hofften auf eine richtige Revolution. Alles sollte anders, gerechter werden. (...) Ich habe vor allem sozialpolitische Fragen beantwortet.\\" as quoted in Zit. nach: Karen Hagemann, Jan Kolossa: Gleiche Rechte, gleiche Pflichten. Hamburg 1990, p. 48. = Communist Party official = In the event, the authority and legitimacy of the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet/Council was never accepted by most Hamburgers, and the Hamburg Parliament (\\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft;\\") soon recovered a level of control of city administration. In 1920 Erna Halbe was appointed Women's Secretary for the party regional leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for the Wasserkante district, comprising Hamburg and a large surrounding area of Holstein to the north of the Elbe. During 1921 (if not before) this became a full-time position. In November 1921, almost certainly under instructions from the party, she relocated to Magdeburg where she took a party position as Policy Leader (\\"Polleiter\\") for the Magdeburg-Anhalt district. In 1923, as a delegate to the Eighth Party Conference, she was elected a member of the trades union commission. During this time she was seen as a member of the party's left wing. In 1924 she relocated again, this time to Berlin, where she took over the Women's Department at the Communist Party's national head office. Her promotion reflected a take-over of the party leadership by its left wing. However, the German party and the Soviet party were closely connected, and as Stalin consolidated his hold in Moscow, the left-wing party leadership in Berlin also became increasingly hardline, doctrinaire, and intolerant of dissent. Halbe became embroiled in the internal ructions, and during 1927 she resigned from her national leadership of the Women's Department. Nevertheless, at the Eleventh Party Conference in 1927 she was still re-elected to the Organisation Commission. Later that year she was sent to work for Red Aid (\\"Rote Hilfe Deutschlands\\"), the party sponsored worker's welfare organisation, running an orphanage in Elgersburg, some considerable distance to the south of Berlin. By now, not being an unquestioning backer of the Stalinist leadership, she had become part of the \\"right-wing\\" opposition to the party leadership that was beginning to coalesce around Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer. Those who questioned the Stalinist position were by now finding themselves demonised as Trotskyites, and in 1929 the Communist Party in Germany broke apart: Erna Halbe was one of those \\"Trotskyites\\" expelled from the party at the start of 1929. This also meant that she lost her job. She earned her living between 1930 and 1932 by selling vacuum cleaners. = Political realignments = Many of those expelled from the Communist Party in 1929 reacted by establishing an alternative communist party, identified as the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (\\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition)\\" / KPDO). Erna Halbe was a member of the national leadership. By this time, however, the apparently relentless electoral progress of the Nazi Party was driving many on the political left for a united front, combining SPD and Communist party members and confronting Hitler's populists. The outcome of the drive for a united left may have ended in further fragmentation. Nevertheless, in order to attract defections from the communist movement a number of SPD members, and others, established the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAPD). In 1932 March Halbe was one of those who moved across to the new party from the KPDO. = Nazi Germany and exile = The Nazis nevertheless took power in January 1933 and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was instantly blamed on \\"communists\\", and it was indeed those with any sort of history of communist activism who now found themselves targeted with particular intensity by the authorities. Many fled abroad: others were arrested. Erna Halbe continued with her (now illegal) political work in Berlin till 30 May 1933 when the Gestapo searched her house and arrested her. She was now held at the women's prison Berlin's Ballin Street in \\"protective custody\\" till 2 August 1933. Following her release, working with Walter Fabian and Joseph Lang she resumed her co-ordination work for the underground SAPD. During the early summer of 1934 a succession of her political comrades were arrested and disappeared. Aware that her own re-arrest was only a matter of time, in June 1934 she escaped to Prague. In Czechoslovakia she lived in exile with Joseph Lang, and worked in the border with Germany helping to organise the escapes into Czechoslovakia of other political exiles. Back in Berlin, in 1938 the Gestapo learned of her activities from her political friends who had failed to escape in time, and demanded that she be handed over by the Czechoslovak government. The government rejected the demand, but at the same time \\"requested\\" her to leave the country as quickly as possible. Travelling via Vienna and Z√ºrich she made her way to Paris which by this time - along with Moscow - had become home to several thousand German political exiles and the de facto headquarters of several exiled left wing German political parties. Although during the 1930s France was more welcoming than other western European countries to refugees from Nazi Germany, by 1940 the welcome was wearing thin, and for a couple of years the refugees had been required to report and confirm their details at the town halls each week. This meant that when, following the German invasion in May 1940, the authorities reacted by identifying the political and racially defined German refugees as enemy aliens, they had accurate up to date records on where the enemy aliens were all living. Erna Halbe and Joseph Lang were, with several hundred others, rounded up overnight and interned in May 1940. Shortly afterwards they were transported to the Gurs internment camp in the south of the country, in the hills to the west of Toulouse. At this stage, not withstanding the very basic level of the accommodation, Gurs was not set up for enforced detention and inmates were able to leave the camp in the day time. As political refugees under imminent threat they both obtained immigration visa for admission to the United States. Joseph Lang, (who was Jewish) made his way to Lisbon, but Halbe was unable to obtain an exit visa from the French authorities, who were also holding on to her identity papers. In the end she was able to catch up with Lang after a brief delay, but she achieved this only after crossing the Pyrenees on foot, carrying a forged birth certificate. On 14 December 1940 Halbe and Lang arrived together in New York City on a ship from Lisbon. Shortly after arriving in New York Erna Halbe and Joseph Lang married. They support themselves initially through casual work, later setting up a little textiles business. After 1945, with friends, they organised support for a number of persecuted socialists in Germany. At the end of 1950 Joseph and Erna Lang returned to Germany where till 1954 Erna Lang continued to work for the Frankfurt office of the International Rescue Committee. Back in Germany (after May 1949, West Germany) the Langs settled in Frankfurt am Main. In January 1951 Erna Lang rejoined the SPD, and she remained politically engaged. Joseph Lang, also a member of the party, played an important part in trades union and party affairs in the Frankfurt and South Hessen regions until his death in 1973. By 1981 it was reported that Erna was living in a retirement home in Frankfurt, the city in which she died on 18 May 1983.

Life The family name is derived from the French 'Laprivick' and the first of the Scottish branch had accompanied Mary Queen of Scots to Scotland and after her defeat at Langside he settled at Dalfram Farm. Lapraik was born at Laigh Dalquhram, about three miles west of Muirkirk, Ayrshire, in 1727. After attending the local school he succeeded his father, as the eldest son, to the family estate, which was of considerable extent. He also rented the lands and mill of Muirsmill, in the neighbourhood. In March 1754 he married Margaret Rankine, sister of Burns's friend John Rankine.John Lapraik lapraik.com, accessed 9 March 2017. She died about 1762 after the birth of her fifth child. In 1766 Lapraik married Janet Anderson of Lightshaw, from a neighbouring farm. They had nine children, and Janet survived her husband by fifteen years. Memorial to John Lapraik, by the River Ayr near Muirkirk, erected in 1914 by the Lapraik Burns Club of Muirkirk Ruined by the collapse of the Ayr Bank in 1772, Lapraik had first to let and then to sell his estate; for several years he struggled to retain his mill and farms, but after an interval had to relinquish them. He was imprisoned as a debtor in Ayr, and released in 1785. He leased lands and the mill at Muirsmill, and in 1798 he opened a public-house at Muirkirk, conducting the village post-office on the same premises. He died there, aged 80, on 7 May 1807. Lapraik and Robert Burns Early in 1785 Robert Burns heard the song \\"When I upon thy bosom lean\\" at a \\"rocking\\", or social gathering, in his house at Mossgiel Farm, Muirkirk. Learning that Lapraik was the author, he made his acquaintance, sending him a verse epistle, dated 1 April 1785. (Burns was not aware that the song was an adaptation of an anonymous lyric published in Walter Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine, 14 October 1773.) Lapraik replied in kind, and Burns sent a second epistle dated 21 April 1785. There were altogether three epistles to Lapraik; they were published by Burns in 1786.Lapraik, John The Burns Encyclopedia, accessed 9 March 2017. Encouraged by Burns's interest, Lapraik published in 1788 a book of poems, Poems on Several Occasions.

As a lieutenant colonel in the Haitian Army, he participated in a failed 1963 coup attempt against Haitian President Fran√ßois Duvalier. He thereafter found political asylum in the United States. Delince authored four books on Haitian politics and commented frequently on Haitian political developments.  Early life  Delince was born in 1923 in the southern seaside town of Jacmel, Haiti. He began a 20-year career with the Haitian Army in 1945. In 1953, Delince graduated from the University of Haiti in Port-au- Prince with degrees in law and economics. He was educated overseas from 1958 to 1961, spending one year studying psychology at the University of Mexico and two years at the University of Paris Institute of Psychology and Institute of Political Studies, receiving certificates in psychology and in political science, respectively.  Coup attempt and flight to America  Francois Duvalier became President of Haiti in 1957 and thereafter consolidated power, becoming the country's brutal dictator. He survived a 1958 coup attempt. In April 1963, Delince, then an army lieutenant colonel, joined other military plotters in a second coup attempt. The other officers included Col. Lionel Honorat, Second Lieutenant Roland Magloire, and former officer Fritz LaMothe. The coup failed, resulting in death sentences for the officers. Delince and the other conspirators fled under cover of night with their families to seek asylum at the Brazilian Embassy in Port-au-Prince. After several weeks, the government granted safe passage out of the country to the officers‚Äô wives and one child, but denied passage to the officers. After nearly 20 months of international pressure, the government yielded, allowing the officers to leave for Brazil. On November 30, 1964, the officers arrived in Rio de Janeiro under Brazilian government guard. The Brazilian authorities detained Delince and the others on Ilha das Flores, an island near Rio de Janeiro. Shortly thereafter, Delince made an early morning escape from the island by convincing a fisherman to take him ashore. He hid briefly in Rio before finding safe passage out of Brazil through a series of intermediaries. On January 27, 1965, Delince boarded a Pan American flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he rejoined his wife and son Patrick. Delince's other children stayed in Haiti with relatives until they could leave the country years later. Delince lived in New York City until the early 1990s, retired to Plantation, Florida, then returned to New York in 2013 for the remainder of his life.  Subsequent career and scholarly work  In 1967, Delince earned a master's degree in library science from Columbia University. He began work in 1968 as a professional librarian with the Brooklyn Public Library, retiring in 1989. Delince wrote four well-received and internationally reviewed books on Haitian politics, economics, and military history. Paul Laraque, a noted Haitian former military officer, poet, and activist known for his surrealist, political poetry, provided the preface to Delince's first book, published in 1979. Delince published his final text in 2000. Throughout his time in New York, Delince frequently commented on Haitian political developments for The New York Times.  Personal life  Delince died on December 30, 2016 at age 93 at his Rego Park, New York home, following several years of health issues including prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two green, yellow and red flowers. It flowers more profusely after fire and grows in swampy areas, sometimes flowering whilst in water.  Description  Caladenia radiata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. One or two green, yellow and red flowers long and wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals have thin, brown, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals have about the same dimensions as the dorsal sepal and turn stiffly downwards. The labellum is long and wide and green with a dark red tip that is curled downwards. The sides of the labellum have erect, linear up to long and there are four rows of dark red, densely crowded calli along the mid-line. Flowering occurs from October to early December.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia radiata was first described in 1948 by William Nicholls from a specimen collected near Yarloop and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (radiata) is derived from the Latin word radius meaning \\"ray\\", \\"rod\\" or \\"spoke\\", referring to the spreading teeth on the sides of the labellum.  Distribution and habitat  The ray spider orchid is found between the Yarloop and Albany in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions where it grows in swampy areas, often flowering in standing water.

The two cemeteries are distinguished according to when they were built: the new cemetery (') was built in 1854 and the old cemetery (') in 1822. They are situated in the La Guilloti√®re neighborhood of the city, in the 7th and 8th arrondissements, just south of Parc Sergent Blandan. They were built to address the shortage of burial spaces in the city. The old cemetery is just north of the new cemetery, and the two are separated by Avenue Berthelot and the railroad tracks connecting Perrache and Part-Dieu railway stations. The new cemetery is the largest in Lyon at .  History  Before the end of the 17th century only small church cemeteries existed in Lyon. In 1695 a cemetery named \\"Cimiti√®re de la Madeleine\\" was built to accommodate the dead from H√¥tel-Dieu de Lyon. In 1807 Cimeti√®re de Loyasse was built on Fourvi√®re hill. These new cemeteries still did not provide enough space for the rapidly growing city, and Guilloti√®re Cemetery was meant to alleviate the growing need for more burial spaces. The development of Guilloti√®re Cemetery had first been proposed on 1 March 1795 to be built at \\"Clos Macors\\", in the commune of La Guilloti√®re, but the cemetery didn't open until 1822. When La Guilloti√®re amalgamated with Lyon in 1852, it became the main cemetery in the city of Lyon. Despite the additional land, by 1854 the space again proved to be insufficient so the new cemetery was constructed to provide additional space for burials. The cemetery sustained significant damage when it was mistakenly bombed by the American military during the Second World War on 26 May 1944. There is still visible damage on some of the graves at the south end of the new cemetery near rue Pierre Delore.

Life Born at Mainz, Germany, on 6 September 1835, he was the second son of F. Dupr√©, merchant of Frankfurt, from a Huguenot background; his father moved to London in 1843, lived in Warrington, and moved back to Giessen in 1845. He was at school in Giessen and Darmstadt. Dupr√© entered the University of Giessen in 1852, aged 17, he, with his brother Friedrich Wilhelm (died 1908), where they studied chemistry under Justus Liebig and Heinrich Will. In 1854 the brothers went to Heidelberg University, where they continued their chemical studies with Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. August took a Heidelberg doctorate in 1855, and they both moved to London, where he acted as assistant to William Odling, then demonstrator of Practical Chemistry in the medical school of Guy's Hospital. Friedrich meanwhile became lecturer in chemistry and toxicology at Westminster Hospital medical school. In 1863 August succeeded Friedrich in the post, which he held till 1897. In 1866 he became a naturalised British subject. From 1874 to 1901 he was lecturer in toxicology at the London School of Medicine for Women, and from 1873 to 1901 he was public analyst to the city of Westminster. Dupr√© was elected a fellow of the Chemical Society in 1860, and served on its council (1871‚Äì5). He was president of the Society of Public Analysts (1877‚Äì8); was an original member of the Institute of Chemistry (1877), and a member of its first and four later councils. He was an original member of the Society of Chemical Industry, serving on the council (1894‚Äì7). He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 3 June 1875. Dupr√© died at his home, Mount Edgcumbe, Sutton, Surrey on 15 July 1907, and was buried at Benhilton, Sutton. Official work In 1871 Dupr√© was appointed chemical referee to the medical department of the Local Government Board. For the Board he undertook, in 1884‚Äì5 and 1887, inquiries on potable water and the contamination and self- purification of rivers. Subsequently with William Joseph Dibdin, Sir Frederick Abel and other chemists, he made a series of investigations, on behalf of the Metropolitan Board of Works, on the condition of the River Thames, and on sewage treatment and purification methods. In this work he made a significant contribution in connecting the bacterial theory with public health issues, and it was the background to Dibdin's work of the 1890s on the contact filter. Dupr√© was engaged officially in researches on explosives. From 1873 he was consulting chemist to the explosives department of the Home Office; in 1888 he was nominated a member of the War Office explosives committee, of which Abel was chairman; and in 1906 he became a member of the Ordnance Research Board. Over 36 years he examined new and imported explosives. At the time of the Fenian attacks in 1882‚Äì3 he investigated bombs, and especially Alfred Whitehead's manufacture of nitro-glycerine, in Ledsam Street, Birmingham. The Treasury sought Dupr√©'s opinion in matters of applied chemistry, and he was often a witness in medico-legal cases in the law courts. At the poisoning trial in 1881 of George Henry Lamson he gave evidence for the prosecution. Works In collaboration with William Odling, Dupr√© discovered the almost universal presence of copper in vegetable and animal tissues.On the Presence of Copper in the Tissues of Plants and Animals, Report Brit. Assoc. 1857; On the Existence of Copper in Organic Tissues, Reports Guy's' Hosp. 1858.

He is credited as the originator of Classical Pentecostalism in Ghana. His intense interest in a magazine called The Sword of the Spirit, published through correspondence, with its editor, Pastor A. Clark, founder of the Faith Tabernacle Church, Philadelphia led him into receiving healing from a chronic stomach disorder and guinea worm infestation miraculously through prayer, a new experience from his Presbyterian upbringing. He therefore embraced the teachings of divine healing, having tested their efficacy by obtaining healing himself, he sought to inculcate this in a prayer group he formed in Asamankese. This group eventually, would become the pioneers of Ghana Classical Pentecostalism. Early life Anim was the third of six children and he attended the Basel Mission school at Boso from Class 1 to Standard 3. He continued at Anum Basel Mission from Standard 4 to Standard 7, completing in 1908. He assisted his brother at Amonokrom (Akuapem) in a carpentry workshop in 1911. Later, he was employed at Pakro in the Basel Mission Factory as a weighing clerk. He was not successful with the job, due to ill health. After years of failing to find a befitting employment in Pakro, he finally returned his home town, in 1916 where he married Dora Sakyibea that same year in 1916. All the four daughters born to the young married couple died and eventually Dora herself also passed away in 1920. He married Esther Osimpo and out of that marriage was born a son, Moses Appiah Anim, the only surviving child of Anim. Madam Esther Anim also died in 1967 His Encounter with \\"Faith\\" Apostle Anim's continuous misfortunes encouraged him to seek for a deeper reflection of God. He found the teachings from the Sword of Spirit magazine \\"a real blessing\\" as he is quoted, \\"though I had intellectually believed the Bible before, I never had the truth presented in a more realistic way....\\" As a result, Anim started evangelistic activities throughout southern Ghana. He associated his ministry first, to Faith Tabernacle but later, due to immorality issues surrounding the leader of the Tabernacle Church he broke the connection with them and subscribed to the Apostolic Faith, Portland, Oregon. The outbreak of Pentecostal revival with the gift of speaking in tongues in Anim‚Äôs church was exceptional. This led Anim and two leaders of his church to travel to Lagos where the Apostolic Church Bradford was having an affiliation with the Apostolic Church Nigeria. Anim subsequently affiliated with the Apostolic Church in 1935, and negotiated for a residential missionaries to be sent to Ghana. The Birth of CACI Anim's request for a resident missionary to Ghana was answered in 1937. Rev. James McKeown, arrived on March 4, 1937 as the first Pentecostal missionary from UK to Asamankese. McKeown's diligence attracted the admiration of all. Anim and his African membership have believed and practiced absolute divine healing, it was their practice to trust God for miraculous healing whenever a member fell sick. James Mckeown the white missionary contracted malaria and the trekking Kyebi District Commissioner, seeing the seriousness of his condition, sent him to the nearest European Hospital now the Ridge Hospital. After McKeown's recovery he returned immediately to Asamankese to continue his work. However, an intense disagreement arose between the members. Some of members felt betrayed by McKeown. The amicable option was that the young movement be split. McKeown heading the Apostolic Church of Gold Coast moved to Akroso and eventually Winneba while Peter Anim led his group under the name THE CHRIST APOSTOLIC CHURCH INTERNATIONAL.

In 1775, Alejandro O'Reilly was sent to the head of an armada to take Algiers. Dey Mohamed Ben Othmane inflicts them a heavy defeat in the vicinity of El Harrach. In 1776, he appointed as Wakil al Kharadj (Minister for Foreign Affairs), Sidi Hassan who will open with his counterpart Floridablanca a period of rapprochement between the governments of Algiers and Madrid. However a peace with Spain is not to the advantage of the dey; piracy earns a lot of income and asking for the release of a captive may even be perceived in Algiers as a humiliation. With the diplomacy over, he finds the pretext of the lack of peace between the Ottoman Empire and Spain, and invites the latter to make peace with the Empire before negotiating with himself to save time and avoid asking for peace in Spain. In fact, even the Ottoman Sultan categorically refuses to interfere in the affairs of these regencies \\"considered as independent states\\". The Spaniards finally get a firman (a recommendation) to the Regencies of North Africa, that the dey Mohamed Ben Othmane had already planned to reject. Indeed, apart from the spiritual connection (the Ottoman sultan is considered caliph and possessor of the holy places of Islam), at the time of Mohamed Ben Othmane, the Regency pretended to manage its internal and external affairs independently. Then King Charles III of Spain decided to declare war again. He sent squads to bomb Algiers between 1783 and 1784 to impose peace. Having found that the Sublime Porte had no authority over Algiers, the Madrid cabinet sought a direct way to negotiate peace. The negotiations were difficult and on June 16, 1785 a peace agreement was concluded. Dey Mohamed Ben Othmane demanded in the peace talks a compensation of 1,000,000 pesos for the various expeditions. The members of the Diwan of Algiers (assembly) also obtained the attribution of the present diplomats.  Domestic policy  On a national level, his reign, the longest of all the deys, was marked by stability. In the management of the affairs he manifested a great sense of the state. He was busy recovering Oran and Mers el Kebir under Spanish tutelage. He appointed an energetic Bey in the west, Mohamed el Kebir, whom he instructs to take these two places. He also carried out successful campaigns to pacify the hinterland. He was also able to face the rise of Constantinois where he named another illustrious Bey Salah Bey ben Mostefa in 1771. He died on July 12, 1791 and was replaced by his Khaznadji (Prime Minister) and his adopted son Sidi Hassan.

His early claim of 1855 to have detected an exoplanet, in orbit around 70 Ophiuchi, is now thought to have been mistaken. Life The seventh child of Stephen Long Jacob (1764‚Äì1851), vicar of Woolavington, Somerset, he was born at his father's vicarage on 19 November 1813; John Jacob (1812‚Äì1858) was his brother, and Sir George le Grand Jacob a cousin. He entered Addiscombe College as an East India Company cadet in 1828, passed for the engineers, and completed his military education at Royal Engineer Establishment, Chatham. After Jacob's arrival at Bombay in 1831, he spent some years with the Great trigonometrical survey in the North-West Provinces, and established a private observatory at Pune in 1842. Bad health meant he took sick leave at the Cape of Good Hope. He became assistant to Andrew Scott Waugh, but again fell ill. In 1843 he went back to England on furlough, married in 1844, and returned in 1845 to India, but left the company's service on attaining the rank of captain in the Bombay engineers. Jacob concentrated on science, and was appointed in December 1848 director of the Madras Observatory. In poor health, he was sent home on sick leave in 1854‚Äì5, and again in 1858‚Äì9. A transit-circle by William Simms arrived from England in March 1858, a month before he finally left the observatory, resigning on 13 October 1859. For the solar eclipse of July 18, 1860, Jacob joined the official expedition to Spain aboard the steamer Himalaya. His project of erecting a mountain observatory at Pune was funded by parliament in 1862. He engaged to work there for three years with a 9-inch equatorial, his own purchase from No√´l Paymal Lerebours, and landed at Bombay on 8 August, but died on reaching Pune on 16 August 1862, aged 48. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1849. Works Jacob presented to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1848 a catalogue of 244 double stars, observed at Pune with a 5-foot Dollond's equatorial. He computed orbits for several noted binaries, and discovered in 1847 that Pi Scorpii is a triple star. In the Madras Observations for 1848‚Äì52 Jacob published a Subsidiary Catalogue of 1,440 Stars selected from the British Association Catalogue. His re-observation of 317 stars from the same collection in 1853‚Äì7 showed that large proper motions had been erroneously attributed to them; the instruments used were a 5-foot transit and a 4-foot mural circle, both by Dollond. The same volume contained 998 measures of 250 double stars made with an equatorial of 6.3 inches aperture constructed for Jacob by Lerebours in 1850. Attempted determinations of stellar parallax gave only the ostensible result of a parallax of 0‚Ä≥.06 for Alpha Herculis. From his measures of the Saturnian and Jovian systems, printed at the expense of the Indian government, Jacob deduced elements for the satellites of Saturn and a corrected mass for Jupiter; and he noticed in 1852, almost simultaneously with William Lassell, the transparency of Saturn's \\"dusky ring\\". His planetary observations were reduced by James Breen in 1861. His results of magnetic observations at Madras (1846‚Äì1850) were published by Jacob in 1854; those made under his superintendence (1851‚Äì1855) by N. R. Pogson in 1884. Jacob published in 1850 some Singapore meteorological observations (1841‚Äì5), and in 1857 those at Dodabetta (1851‚Äì5). While in England in 1855 Jacob wrote \\"A few more words on the Plurality of Worlds\\" in which he suggested life on other planets (\\"probably that some of the known planets are inhabited, not very improbable that all of them are\\"), and described his computation of stellar orbits for the Royal Astronomical Society. Jacob posited that apparent orbital anomalies in the binary star 70 Ophiuchi might be caused by an exoplanet.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 15, Issue 9, July 1855, Pages 228‚Äì230 While these anomalies are now thought to have other causes, this was the first serious claim by an astronomer to have detected an exoplanet using scientific methods: 100 years before the first exoplanet was conclusively detected and well before the science of exoplanets was even in its infancy. Professor David Kipping states that the ‚Äò‚Äúclaim is so remarkable because Jacob was making tiny measurements (80 milliarc seconds or 22 millionths of a degree) with the naked eye, at a time when he wasn‚Äôt even sure whether Newton‚Äôs law of gravity held sway in distant parts of the galaxy. While Jacob... was ultimately proved wrong, he had the audacity to try.‚ÄùProfessor David Kipping, Columbia University Dept of Astronomy, Cool Worlds video series Family Jacob married in 1844, Elizabeth, fourth daughter of Mathew Coates of Gainsborough, who survived him.

He was a member of the House of La Rochefoucauld (one of the oldest and most famous French noble families, originating in La Roche in the 10th-11th centuries) and a major lord under the Ancien R√©gime. He also played a political role in 1789 early on in the French Revolution before being executed in the September Massacres. He was a duke, initially with the title 'duc d'Enville' or 'duc d'Anville' and later with that of 6th duc de La Rochefoucauld. He was a cousin to Fran√ßois Alexandre Fr√©d√©ric de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt and Ambroise- Polycarpe de La Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville. Life He was a son of Jean- Baptiste de La Rochefoucauld de Roye (killed in the 1746 Duc d'Anville expedition) and Marie-Louise-Nicole de La Rochefoucauld. In 1762,he married Louise-Pauline de Gand de M√©rode, but they had no children. That same year he inherited the title of duc de La Rochefoucauld on the death of his grandfather Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld (29 September 1690 - 1762). His second marriage was in 1780 to his niece Alexandrine Charlotte de Rohan-Chabot - this marriage was also without issue. He was one of the keenest French defenders of the American Revolution, befriending and translating for Benjamin Franklin - in Paris in 1783 he and Franklin published Constitutions des Treize √âtats-Unis de l'Am√©rique (Constitutions of 13 United States of America). He was also passionate about natural sciences and travelled to England, Sweden (where he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences), Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Savoy. His friends also included Desmarest, Dolomieu, Saussure, Turgot, Condorcet. He served as president of the Soci√©t√© royale de m√©decine and the Acad√©mie royale des sciences. He was elected as a deputy to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the 47 deputies from the nobility who joined forces with the Third Estate on 25 June 1789. He proposed article XI of the 1789 Declaration - that article was adopted. Worried by the turn of events, he became a member of his department's directory after the Constituent Assembly split. He opposed P√©tion and after the events of 10th August 1792 he resigned and left Paris to escape the people's anger. He was arrested at Gisors whilst escorting his wife and mother from Forges to the ch√¢teau de La Roche-Guyon, accompanied by Dolomieu. He was killed on 4 September 1792 by volunteer troops from Sarthe and Orne who were hunting aristocrats whilst en route to fight the Prussians, who were aiming to capture Verdun.Fr√©d√©ric Bluche, Septembre 1792.

Its plot follows Jack (Dillon), a serial killer who, over a 12-year period from the late 1970s into 1980s, commits numerous murders in the U.S. state of Washington. Utilizing Dante's Inferno as a metatext, the film is structured as a series flashback vignettes relayed by Jack to the Roman poet Virgil, during which Jack attempts to make an argument for his crimes. Originally conceived as a television project by Von Trier, The House That Jack Built began production in Sweden in 2016. In preparing for his role, Dillon utilized serial killer Ted Bundy as inspiration for his character. The film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, marking von Trier's return to the festival after more than six years. It was given a single-day theatrical release on 28 November 2018 in the United States, and polarized critics. Plot Jack, a prolific serial killer and failed architect in 1980s Washington, recounts five of his crimes to Virgil‚Äîwhom he refers to as Verge‚Äîas Verge leads Jack through the nine circles of Hell. Each of Jack's crimes, depicted through flashback, feature commentary from both Jack and Verge, as Jack attempts to expound his worldview and a rationale for his murders as a grand artistic gesture. In the first incident, Jack encounters a woman on a rural road who needs to fix her broken jack to repair a flat tire. He takes her to the local blacksmith who repairs it, but when they return and attempt to lift the car, the jack breaks again. The woman requests that Jack return her to the blacksmith. Offended by her manner, Jack bludgeons her with the tire jack. He stores her body in an industrial freezer inside a factory building, which he previously purchased from a pizzeria. In the second incident, Jack cons his way into the home of a widow, Claire, and strangles her to death before stabbing her in the chest. At night, Jack drags Claire's body out of her house and puts it in the back of his car. His obsessive-compulsive disorder propels him to meticulously clean every surface of the house, nearly resulting in him being caught when a suspicious police officer stops in the area. Jack hides Claire's body in the bushes before the officer stops by Claire's home. Jack manages to outwit the guileless officer by pretending to be an acquaintance of Claire. Jack soon leaves, he grabs rope from the plastic that the body was wrapped up in and ties it to the van. Jack drives off towing Claire‚Äôs body behind the van creating a blood trail from the head dragging on the pavement. He arrives at the warehouse as it starts raining, washing away the blood trail and putting Claire's corpse in the freezer. After this incident, Jack declares himself \\"Mr. Sophistication,\\" and begins signing anonymous letters to the media with this moniker. He also develops a fetish for posing and photographing his victims' corpses. In the third incident, Jack brings his girlfriend and her two sons, Grumpy and George, on a hunting trip in a forest clearing. During the excursion, he kills both sons with a rifle from a hunting tower before forcing the woman to have a picnic with their corpses. He then hunts and ultimately kills her. As Jack recounts this incident‚Äîwhich he analogizes to hunting animals‚ÄîVerge comments with particular disgust for Jack's murdering of children. In the fourth incident, Jack is carrying on a dysfunctional relationship with Jacqueline (Riley Keough), whom he demeaningly refers to as \\"Simple\\" as he believes her to be stupid. When he drunkenly confesses to Jacqueline that he has killed 60 people, she does not believe him. After he marks red circles around her breasts with a marker, she becomes frightened and approaches a policeman, but he dismisses her and Jack as drunks. After being locked without escape in her apartment, Jack binds and gags her before cutting off her breasts with a knife. He pins one of the breasts to the policeman's car and fashions the other into a wallet. In the fifth incident, Jack has detained five men in his freezer and bound them with their heads positioned along a post, intending to kill all of them with a single bullet. Upon realizing his ammunition has been mislabeled, he leaves and angrily chastises the gun shop owner before visiting his best friend, SP, who has phoned a police officer after mistakenly believing Jack to be responsible for a recent robbery. Amused as to this being how he is to be caught, Jack stabs SP through the throat before killing the summoned officer after waiting for them to arrive. Jack steals the officer's car and returns to his freezer with the appropriate ammunition. Needing more space to gain focus through the scope, Jack manages to unseal a closed door inside the freezer, revealing a second chamber; inside, he meets Verge for the first time, who reveals he has been observing Jack throughout his life and reminds him that he has never built the literal home he intended to build; throughout the film, Jack has been attempting to build the perfect house in-between his murders. In the freezer, Jack arranges the numerous frozen corpses he has collected over the years into the shape of a house. As police descend on the freezer, drawn by the car siren Jack has left on outside, Jack enters his makeshift house, and follows Verge into a hole in the ground, entering Hell alive. After passing a window overlooking the Elisian Fields, the two eventually reach a pit leading to the ninth circle and centre of Hell. A broken bridge spans the pit. Jack notices a stairway on the other side of the bridge, which Verge says leads the way out of Hell. Jack attempts to scale a rock wall to access the staircase, against Verge's advice, and ultimately falls into the abyss below.  Cast  Production =Development= Von Trier originally developed the idea as a television series, but in February 2016, he announced that it would be a film. After extensively researching serial killers, von Trier had a completed script by May 2016. International sales rights for the film belong to TrustNordisk with von Trier's Zentropa producing. Film i V√§st partly financed the film, and the Copenhagen Film Fund provided ‚Ç¨1.08 million in production subsidies. The film is a co-production between France, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. The film's epilogue, in which Jack literally goes to Hell for his crimes, was suggested by Von Trier's co-writer, Jenle Hallund, and which Von Trier felt appropriate: \\"I thought that‚Äôs a good idea because it‚Äôs a long time since we‚Äôve really visited Hell in films. Particularly the journey to Hell. We put it together from different conceptions, or whatever the word is, of Hell. The Elysian Fields is something from the Roman mythology. I‚Äôm quite sure that Hell doesn‚Äôt look like what we have made for this film.\\" Von Trier also stated he was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock to give the film a \\"classical ending\\" in which Jack is punished: \\"Somehow I felt a little Hitchcock-like at the end of the film, with Jack hanging there above the abject depths. Never let the bad guy hang on his nails, as the audience won‚Äôt care... Psychopaths act out of an irrational certainty that they won‚Äôt be caught. That‚Äôs why the ending is like it is. It would be typical for me to let him live. But then I thought about good old Hitchcock and decided that this calls for a classical ending.\\" =Casting= On 2 November 2016, von Trier announced that Matt Dillon would play the film's lead role. Announcements soon followed in February 2017 that Riley Keough and Sofie Gr√•b√∏l would also be joining the production with Uma Thurman's participation being announced the following month. The same month, von Trier described the film as celebrating \\"the idea that life is evil and soulless\\". =Filming= Principal photography began in March 2017 outside Bengtsfors in Dalsland, Sweden and was shot in Copenhagen, Gribskov, Trollh√§ttan, Peak District and Montemerano. Dillon drew inspiration from American serial killer Ted Bundy when preparing for the role. Von Trier split the filming into two parts to allow the opportunity for editing in between, something he has never done before. The film spent nearly a year in post- production, which included complicated special effects. Release =Theatrical= In May 2017, IFC Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. As of March 2017, von Trier was negotiating to have the film premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, despite his being previously banned from the festival. On 19 April 2018, the film was selected to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival out of competition. After the announcement, a teaser trailer was released. The film had its world premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on 14 May 2018. It was reported that more than 100 audience members walked out during the premiere, though a 10-minute standing ovation followed the screening. In October 2018, it was reported that the director's cut, which is the uncensored version that played at Cannes, would play in U.S. theaters for one night in November, followed by an edited R-rated version release in selected theaters and on digital platforms beginning on 14 December. Immediately following the unrated director's cut screenings, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) issued a statement condemning the screening for not adhering to the board's guidelines. In the statement, it was noted that \\"the screening of an unrated version of the film in such close proximity to the release of the rated version‚Äîwithout obtaining a waiver‚Äîis in violation of the rating system‚Äôs rules... Failure to comply with the rules can create confusion among parents and undermine the rating system ‚Äî and may result in the imposition of sanctions against the film‚Äôs submitter.\\" By the 5 December, the MPAA had resolved the dispute with IFC Films by pushing the digital release of the director's cut back to 2019, as opposed to coinciding with the December 14 theatrical release of the R-rated cut. On 6 December 2018, the director's cut was released to purchase on YouTube for several hours. =Home media= The House That Jack Built was released on DVD and Blu- ray disc (uncensored cut) in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2019 by Artificial Eye. Extra features include an introduction by director, an in-depth interview with director, a twenty-minute making-of featurette and theatrical Trailer. On 4 February 2020, Scream Factory released the film in the United States as a 2-disc Blu-ray with both cuts (theatrical and director's), as well as a 26-minute interview with von Trier by professor Peter Schepelern, filmed shortly after von Trier's winning of the Sonning Prize. Also included is the US theatrical trailer, the Cannes Film Festival teaser trailer, a short introduction from von Trier, and von Trier's 2016 announcement of the film's production. Reception =Box office= The House That Jack Built has grossed $259,017 in the United States, and $5,307,759 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $5,566,776. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 131 reviews, and an average rating of 6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The House That Jack Built presents writer-director Lars von Trier at his most proudly uncompromising: hard to ignore, and for many viewers, just as difficult to digest.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". IndieWire critic Eric Kohn gave the film an \\"A-\\" and called the film a \\"wild masterpiece.\\" BBC.com's Nicolas Barber gave the film four stars out of five and said \\"Undoubtedly a bold and stimulating film which no one but Denmark's notorious provocateur-auteur could have made.\\" Owen Gleiberman from Variety gave the film a positive review, and stated \\"It's halfway between a subversive good movie and a stunt. It's designed to get under your skin, and does.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"The House That Jack Built is definitely something to see. But what's most surprising is that it's just as often inane as unsettling.\\" Armond White says the film satirizes \\"guilt-free violence\\" by \\"rubbing the audience‚Äôs face in the ugliness it enjoys.\\" The Guardians Peter Bradshaw referred to the film as \\"an ordeal of gruesomeness and tiresomeness\\", though he did praise its closing scene. The film's protagonist was also compared to Ted Bundy, a real life serial killer. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times criticized the film for reveling in \\"in grisly, in-your-face violence and wan philosophical digressions,\\" concluding: \\" Von Trier has managed to cobble together just enough of interest ‚Äî odd moments, pieces of performance, stray ideas and the simple audacity of putting this mess out into the world, that it feels like there may be something there worth considering, a maddening possibility. And that may be his cruelest prank of all.\\" Despite audience backlash toward a scene involving the main character's mutilation of a duckling when he was a child, PETA has defended the film in a statement praising its accurate portrayal of the link between adolescent animal abuse and psychopathy and for the realistic special effects. =Accolades= The film was nominated for Art Cinema Award and Hamburg Producers Award at the 26th Hamburg Film Festival. It won Best European Film and was nominated for Best International Feature Film at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival.

It policed the city from 1 January 1869 until 31 March 1968. It was established to succeed a \\"watch and ward\\" force that had been founded in 1835. On 1 April 1968 it and four other forces merged to form the Thames Valley Constabulary, which has since been renamed Thames Valley Police. Foundation The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 required each incorporated borough in England or Wales to form a watch committee, and for that committee to establish a force of constables to police their borough. But the Oxford University Police, which had been founded in 1829, already policed the city at night, so the new municipal \\"watch and ward\\" force policed the city only by day. In 1868 Parliament passed the Oxford Police Act, which empowered the Corporation of Oxford to supersede its \\"watch and ward\\" force with a modern one that would be modelled on London's Metropolitan Police Force and whose duties would including night policing of the city. The first Chief Officer was Charles Head, who had been an Inspector with \\"D\\" Division of the Metropolitan Police. Head served as the force's Chief Officer for 28 years. Toward the end of 1868 Head and six other Metropolitan Police officers moved to Oxford to form the nucleus of the new force. Two were made Inspectors of the new force: Malcolm Hunter and George Barratt. Other recruits included five men from the Oxford University Police and four from the preceding \\"watch and ward\\" force. The new force's initial complement was between 25 and 30 officers. The force's first police station was Kemp Hall, a Jacobean timber-framed house built in 1637 in a narrow yard south of the High Street. Necessary alterations to the building were not complete by 1 January 1869, so the new force was at first accommodated in a committee room in Oxford Town Hall. In October 1870 Kemp Hall was finally ready for the force to move in. As well as offices and cells, the station included lodgings upstairs for 14 or 15 unmarried officers. At first the force did not have uniforms for all its officers. On 4 February 1869 two constables named Gilkes and Wilkes, who lacked uniforms, were sent to patrol St. Ebbes, which then was a poor parish of the city. Little is known of Wilkes, but Joseph Gilkes was originally from Great Rollright and had served as a constable with the Metropolitan Police. Gilkes and Wilkes found a crowd of about 30 people outside a shop in Blackfriars Road, whom they tried to disperse. A man called John Cox assaulted Gilkes, and his wife Kegiah Cox threw a meat dish at him, striking him in the head. Gilkes was knocked to the ground and Wilkes fled back to the police station. Gilkes got to his feet and tried to escape, but was pursued by the crowd throwing plates and saucepans at him. Blackfriars Road ended at the River Thames. Gilkes tried to ford the river to escape, but it was in flood and he was swept away and drowned. Blue Boar Street police station In 1893 work began to build a new Oxford Town Hall, which was to include a new police station to succeed Kemp Hall. The Prince of Wales opened the new building in May 1897. University of Oxford undergraduates were expected to mount a large demonstration at the opening ceremony, so a detachment of the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch was deployed to reinforce the small Oxford force. The Metropolitan officers were unused to Oxford undergraduates, and considered the boisterous crowd to be a danger. The officers attacked the crowd with batons, causing several serious injuries. The crowd reciprocated, unhorsing one officer and trampling him. FE Smith was detained as the first prisoner in the cells of the police station in the newly built Oxford Town Hall. He later served as Solicitor General and Lord Chancellor. A young law don, FE Smith, who had taken no part in the violence, saw police mishandling his college servant. Smith went to rescue his servant but was arrested. He became the first prisoner in one of the cells of the new police station in the new Town Hall. But the new police station was not completely ready for use. The force continued to operate from Kemp Hall, and did not move to the town hall until nearer the end of the century. It was called Blue Boar Street police station, after the street down the side of the Town Hall in which it had its entrance. As at Kemp Hall, accommodation was provided for unmarried officers to live on the premises. The officers' new rooms were at the top of the Town Hall. A house called Ebor House was built in Blue Boar Street as accommodation for the Chief Officer. Charles Head retired on 12 March 1897, so its first occupant was probably his successor, Oswald Cole. Cole was born in Manchester and had spent his boyhood in York. He joined the Metropolitan Police in 1886, enjoyed rapid promotion and had transferred to the Oxford force in 1891. Upon Cole's appointment the title was changed from Chief Officer or Superintendent to Chief Constable. Cole was a keen cricketer. He did much to develop the force's sporting activities, including its tug of war team which became very successful. Other police stations By 1903 the force had stations in Cowley and Summertown. In October 1909 East Oxford police station opened at the junction of St Mary's Road and James Street. First World War When the First World War broke out, seven officers who were Army reservists were recalled to their regiments. In 1916 conscription was introduced in Great Britain. 36 Oxford officers were called up, leaving the force under strength. In 1917 the force recruited its first woman constable, Grace Costin. In August 1918 and June 1919 there were two national police strikes. Officers of the Oxford force did not take part. The Interbellum On 5 March 1924 Oswald Cole died at his desk in his office. He had been ill with pneumonia. Chief Inspector Osbourne took over as acting chief constable, but it was Charles Fox who was appointed as Cole's permanent successor. Fox was born in Hove in East Sussex. He had served with Portsmouth Borough Police in Hampshire, transferred to Oxford in 1914 and been promoted to Sergeant. In 1917 he joined the Royal Field Artillery, with whom he served in India. After the war he returned to Oxford and resumed his police career. Fox was only 28 when he was put in charge, making him one of the youngest Chief Constables in the country. The force continued to have a diverse sporting and cultural life. In 1925 it even had its own Morris dancing side. The force introduced its first police motorcycle, a Sunbeam, in 1928. Thereafter it used both solo machines and sidecar combinations. Soon afterward police cars were introduced, initially Morris cars built in Oxford and MG T-type sports cars built in nearby Abingdon. On 15 October 1931 the force suffered its second death of an in the line of duty. PC Alfred Needle, aged 23, was fatally injured by a motor car which failed to stop. In 1938 a serial blackmailer, Patrick Tuellman, tried to kidnap William Morris, the head of Morris Motors, for a ¬£100,000 ransom. Tuellman had an accomplice, who betrayed his plan to the police. On 28 May 1938 the Oxford police ambushed Tuellman in his car. Officers found him to be in possession of two automatic pistols, ammunition and items of disguise. Two months later Birmingham Assizes tried him and he served seven years' penal servitude. In 1936 Fox called for a new, larger police station. This was built lower down St Aldate's Street, opposite the junction with Speedwell Street, and completed in 1938. Second World War When the Second World War broke out, Charles Fox was made Air Raid Precautions controller in addition to his duties as Chief Constable. Some of his officers were trained as firefighters or ambulance drivers in addition to their police duties. As in the First World War, numerous officers were enlisted in the armed forces. 39 War Reserve constables were appointed to cover their absence. At the end of the war the force's strength was 134 officers and one woman sergeant. In 1946 a war memorial at St Aldate's police station was unveiled to commemorate those officers who were lost serving in the armed forces. Final decades After the war the force continued to modernise. Its vehicle fleet became somewhat mixed, including two 1945 MG TC Midget sports cars, a 1948 Riley RM saloon built in Abingdon, three Wolseley saloons built in Cowley, at least two other saloon cars, a large van and a BSA motorcycle. In 1956 Charles Fox retired as Chief Constable and the Watch Committee appointed Clement Burrows as his successor. Burrows was an outside appointment. He had joined the Somerset Constabulary in 1927, risen to Chief Inspector, and from 1953 he had been Assistant Commandant of the Police College. Burrows modernised and diversified the force, introducing a police dog section in July 1959 and asking for his foot patrol officers to be equipped with portable police radio. New motorcycles were introduced, including a 1957 single-cylinder Royal Enfield, two 1958 or 1959 Triumph twins and a 1959 or 1960 Triumph twin. New cars included a Morris Isis, a 1959 Wolseley 15/60 saloon and 1962 Morris 1100. Burrows introduced the city's first portable speed radar in 1961. With it his officers caught 508 offenders in the second half of that year. In 1964 Traffic Wardens were introduced, and a telex machine was installed in St Aldate's police station. The dog section used German Shepherds. Initially it had only two handlers and two dogs, \\"Kim\\" and \\"Danko\\". In 1961 \\"Kim\\" contracted an incurable eye infection, was put down and replaced with a new dog, \\"Kim II\\". In 1962 the section was doubled with two additional handlers and their dogs \\"Micky\\" and \\"Rex\\". \\"Danko\\" was the force's longest-serving dog. In his career he made 30 arrests. But in 1965 he suffered a leg injury and had to be put down. In 1966 \\"Micky\\" retired from the force with his handler. They were succeeded by a new handler with the Oxford force's final dog, \\"Kelly\\". In his Annual Report for 1957 Burrows had said he wanted beat officers to have portable radios \\"within five years\\". In fact they were not introduced until November 1965. Until then the force had a network of Police telephone pillars. These were soon removed except for one at Carfax, which survived until at least 1979. The force was growing and was restructured into three divisions. \\"A\\" Division was administrative, \\"B\\" Division policed central Oxford and \\"C\\" Division policed Cowley. The original Cowley police station was replaced by a new one in Oxford Road that was opened on 14 September 1966. Drug abuse was an increasing problem, notably among some of Oxford's students. In 1967 the Oxford force formed the country's first drug squad. Since the 1930s most of the Oxford force's police cars had been built by the Nuffield Organization: Morris, MG, Riley and Wolseley. In its final year the force changed its practice by acquiring from Hartwell, a local dealer, four of Ford's newly introduced Escort Mk I saloons. Dissolution From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century many incorporated boroughs in Great Britain had their own police forces. Separately, each county also had its own police force. By 1962 Great Britain had 158 civil police forces, and of these 97 had fewer than 350 officers. Many forces had standing arrangements to co-operate with neighbouring forces. Oxford City Police, for example, cooperated with Oxfordshire Constabulary and until 1961 the two forces had shared a joint scheme for police radio. But it was not clear that such small forces were the best way to police Great Britain. The question was compounded by corruption cases, notably involving Brighton borough police in 1958 and Nottingham City Police in 1959. There was no suggestion of such corruption involving the Oxford force. But in 1960 a Royal Commission, the Willink Commission, was established to review the governance of police forces in Great Britain and make recommendations. In 1962 the Wellink Commission submitted its report, which recommended that a police force should have more than 500 members and should police an area with a population of at least 250,000. It recommended exempting small forces of between 200 and 350 officers, but \\"justifiable only by special circumstances such as the distribution of the population and the geography of the area\\". Parliament accepted Wellink Commission's findings and passed the Police Act 1964, which provided inter alia for small forces to be merged. Oxford had too small a population and too few officers to remain independent, and no special circumstances that qualified for an exemption. Therefore, on 1 April 1968 the Oxford force merged with Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire County Constabularies and Reading Borough Police to form Thames Valley Constabulary. Clement Burrows was made Assistant Chief Constable (Administration) of the new force, and in 1970 was promoted to Deputy Chief Constable. Thames Valley Constabulary was later renamed Thames Valley Police. It remains the police force for Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. In popular culture ITV's fictional drama series Endeavour portrays Detective Constable Endeavour Morse as he investigates crime in Oxford as a member of Oxford CID, based in Cowley police station. The first series starts some time after the General Election in October 1964. Its fifth series starts in April 1968, just after the Oxford force's absorption into the new Thames Valley Constabulary. The series are a prequel to the Inspector Morse drama series, in which a much older Endeavour Morse, by then a Detective Chief Inspector, investigates murders in and around Oxford with Thames Valley Police.

Life From the Moscow branch of the House of Golitsyn, he was the son of Vladimir Borisovich Golitsyn and his wife Natalya Petrovna - she was the inspiration for the lead character in Pushkin's The Queen of Spades. His younger siblings were Sophie Vladimirovna Stroganov, countess Ekaterina Vladimirovna Apraksina and prince Dmitry Golitsyn. He joined up as a sergeant in the Semyonovsky Regiment of Russia's Imperial Guard in 1781 aged 12. Between 1782 and 1786 he studied at the Protestant faculty in Strasbourg to perfect his French and German language skills and his military knowledge. He also keenly studied music and dance, gaining him the nickname \\"Boris-Vestris\\" after the French dancer Auguste Vestris. He continued his education as a sub-lieutenant at the war school in Paris during the last years of the Ancien Regime and the early phases of the French Revolution, which he assisted, though he became very hostile to the turn of events and joined the Swedish army to fight against Revolutionary France. In 1794 he also fought in Poland (then on the eve of its Third Partition), receiving the Order of St George fourth class on 1 January 1795 for brave deeds in the attack on the fortress at Warsaw during the battle of Praga on 24 October 1794 (Old Style) - during that battle he had fought alongside his brother Dmitry. He was made a colonel in 1796 then major general in 1798 commanding the St Petersburg Grenadier Regiment. On 31 December 1799 he rose to his final rank of lieutenant general before resigning on 24 March the following year. He rejoined the army in 1801 and was put in command of the Pavlovsky Grenadier Regiment in the Guards on 20 May 1802. He was made inspector of Smolensk's infantry regiments on 11 October 1803 and fought in the battles of 1805. He was badly wounded at the battle of Austerlitz and resigned on health grounds on 7 September 1806. As well as being a skilled musician and dancer, he also tried writing in his youth, publishing 'Aurora' and 'Diogenes and Glyceria' in The Literary Almanac in 1788 when only twenty years old. He also made the first Russian translations of works by Oliver Goldsmith and Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld. He was a friend of Gavrila Derzhavin and with him founded a literary society in 1811 called La Causerie des amateurs des mots russes to study archaisms in Russian. That society was strongly criticized by backers of Nikolay Karamzin. He rejoined the army yet again during the French invasion of Russia in 1812, fighting at the battle of Smolensk and being wounded at the battle of Borodino. He refused to be evacuated and died at Vilnius on 6 January 1813. His body was later moved to his family estate at Viaziomy Castle near Moscow. In 1936 it was reburied in the family chapel of Moscow's Donskoy Monastery.

The historic building situated in Tacloban also served as the temporary national capitol in 1944 to 1945 during the World War II era. History The Leyte Provincial Capitol in Tacloban dates back to the American colonial administration. The construction of the building began on 1917 during the administration of then-Leyte Governor Salvador Demetrio and was completed and inaugurated in 1924 during the tenure of Leyte Governor Honorio L√≥pez. The building exhibits a neoclassical architectural design. The capitol complex hosts a main structure with a legislative building behind it. During the World War II era, the building sustained damage when the Imperial Japanese forces occupied the Philippines in the 1940s. The building also became the seat of the Philippine Commonwealth government from October 23, 1944 to February 27, 1945 as the Allied forces liberated the Philippine islands from Japanese control. Sergio Osme√±a was sworn in as President by American general Douglas MacArthur inside the building. The capitol underwent renovations in 1964 during the tenure of then-Leyte Governor Norberto Romualdez Jr. During the administration of Leyte Governor Leopoldo Petilla, there were plans to move to seat of government of Leyte to Palo after Tacloban was elevated into a highly urbanized city. In 2013, the building was hit by storm surges caused by Typhoon Haiyan, which was locally known as Super Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines. In 2015, Governor Petilla expressed plans to convert the building into a museum while still retaining the capitol as meeting place for dignitaries. In May 2019, the provincial government of Leyte under the administration of Governor Leopoldo Petilla abandoned the capitol after it sustained further damages due to the magnitude 6.4 Visayas earthquake of April 23, 2019. Even if retrofitting has been made on the building the Leyte government decided to pursue its plans to build a new capitol in Palo and convert the original capitol into a museum.

P. Dutton. The novel, set in five parts, tells the family history of succeeding generations of characters named George Mills. The story covers more than 1,000 years from the First Crusade in Europe to the Ottoman Empire to present-day America. Elkin won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. Elkin mentioned George Mills as one of his favorite novels. The novel is considered Elkin's \\"longest and most complexly organized work\\".  Plot  The first George Mills sets out on a journey with his lord on the First Crusade. But he eventually gets lost in the Netherlands and reaches a salt mine in Poland. His lord at the mines is Guillalume, who teaches him some life lessons. Mills becomes aware of what is written in his fate and this helps him understand the walks of life in this world in a better manner. Despite having the knowledge of what would happen in the future, his timidity and powerlessness does not bring out any situation-changing effects. The novel covers the history of succeeding family members named George Mills and all of them are aware of their fates and equally feeble and ineffective in changing their circumstances. The 43rd Mills encounters King George IV and is assigned on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople, where he first joins the Janissaries but later ends up in the Ottoman Sultan's harem doing household chores. He escapes from there and reaches America. The present-day Mills in America is a caretaker of an old woman named Judith Glazer in St. Louis, who is in the final stages of terminal cancer. Mills accompanies Glazer to Mexico and upon her death participates in her funeral together with her family.  Publication  Elkin worked for over seven years writing George Mills and by the end of its completion, he felt exhausted and insisted this would be his last fictional work. But after watching a British news report of how terminally ill children had a memorable experience at Disneyland, he wrote his next novel, The Magic Kingdom (1985), and dedicated it to his son who had died young from a medical ailment after lengthy treatments. George Mills was published on 25 October 1982. In 1989, Elkin mentioned that several sections of George Mills had been adapted from the 1936 novel Absalom, Absalom! by William Faulkner. He also mentioned that in writing the novel, he came to realise \\"that I was a novelist, that anything I say is a part of this novel is a part of this novel\\".  Review and reception  Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"a leaky collection of parts rather than one whole strong book\\" but said it was required reading for connoisseurs of comic fiction. The New York Times reviewer Leslie Epstein complimented \\"the novel's fine writing, flashes of humor and memorable heroine\\", but felt that the plot was \\"out of control\\". Brad Owens of The Christian Science Monitor praised the novel for its \\"energetic entertainment\\" and said that it \\"sometimes overpowers its more serious intentions\\".  Awards  Elkin won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award in the fiction category for the novel. The novel was nominated along with Levitation: Five Fictions (by Cynthia Ozick), Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant (by Anne Tyler), The Color Purple (by Alice Walker), and Shiloh and Other Stories (by Bobbie Ann Mason).

He was organist at Clifton Church, and subsequently of two Bristol churches, St James' Priory and St Nicholas. In 1825 he proceeded to the degree of Doctor of Music from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. At this period he was a proponent of the C-compass organ. The \\"long compass\\" or \\"GGG- compass\\" organ, with pitch range extending below its lowest C, had been the British and American standard since the 17th century, but by the 1840s it was being replaced by the continental standard that ran from C to C. Hodges was active as a designer in making these changes. In 1838 Hodges went with his family to America. He took up an appointment as organist to Toronto Cathedral. Then he became organist to St. John's Chapel in New York; and in 1846 to the third Trinity Church, opened on 21 May with an organ built to his own specifications. In bad health, Hodges resigned his appointments and returned in 1863 to England. He died at Clifton, Bristol, 1 September 1867. Works Hodges composed a morning and evening service and two anthems for the reopening of the organ, at St James' Priory, Bristol, 2 May 1824, and published them in 1825. A second edition of the evening service, in C, was published at New York in 1863. He also published: * An Apology for Church Music and Musical Festivals, in answer to the animadversions of the \\"Standard\\" and the \\"Record\\", Bristol, 1834. * Essay on the Cultivation of Church Music, 1841. * Canticles of the Church, compiled New York, 1864. * The Te Deum, with Kyrie Chant and Ter Sanctus, in D, published after the composer's death by his daughter, London, 1885.

Yekutieli is a prominent figure in Israeli street-art culture, more recently exhibiting in galleries and museums internationally using ready-made materials, mixed media pieces, photographs, videos and text. Yekutieli has undertaken community and long-term projects in the form of Social Practice art, that deal with ideas of re- contextualization and dialogue through public space.  Career  = Early work = Know Hope artwork in Vienna Know Hope artwork in Atlanta Yekutieli started exhibiting his work in the streets of Tel Aviv in early 2005. His pseudonym Know Hope began appearing next to his most common long-arms and long-legged unisex character. A couple of years after the INSIDE JOB, a street-art group show in the Helena Rubenstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art, Yekutieli began exhibiting in early 2013 in one of Israel's most prominent galleries Gordon Gallery. That same year, Yekutieli also started working with Steve Lazarides and his London-based gallery Lazarides Rathbone. In 2014 Yekutieli took part in a group exhibit in the Roskilde Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2014, parallel to his iconography work that by now has developed to include a repetitive use of white-flags, birds, wood, and fences, Yekutieli began working on long term ongoing projects. = Truth and Method (2014‚Äìpresent) = In late 2014 Yekutieli sent out an open call for participants in Tel Aviv and NYC to take part in his art and allow him to tattoo them. Yekutieli's websites describes the project as: > \\"Truth and Method is firmly based on real human situations, continuing a > process of extensive observations of context and appropriation whilst > providing greater insight into a reflective practice. > Images of site-specific street pieces form the basis of the exhibition, with > a series of poignant, text-based messages creating open-ended narratives > reinforced by their context. This initial starting point allows each urban > environment to take an active part in the dialogue and determine how the > audience may perceive them. > Following this, the same texts are tattooed on volunteer participants, > extending the work away from the ethereal nature of outdoor work and instead > taking on a more permanent quality. By translating the initial text-based > artwork onto active participants the work manifests itself in a new shape > with a far more intimate meaning.\\" The Truth and Method project was first exhibited in the Tel Aviv Gordon Gallery.

Funzing was founded in Israel in 2014 by Avigur Zmora, the former CEO of Playtech. Funzing is currently active in London, Manchester, Tel Aviv and Singapore. The online community marketplace promotes diversity in people's free time activities, experiences vary from supper clubs, tours, workshops to one-off lectures and classes.  History  Funzing was founded in Israel in 2014. It was the brainchild of Avigur Zmora, former CEO of Playtech, who went on to set up the company together with Eran Alon, Noa Moscati, and Yaron Saghiv. The startup raised an initial investment capital from venture capital firm Inimiti for its launch in the United Kingdom, specifically targeting the Greater London area. This amounted to $1.5 million. Currently, there are over 2,000 registered hosts on the Funzing system, and more than 35,000 individuals have attended events as of June 2016.  Concept  According to co-founder Yaron Saghiv, the idea about the online sharing economy came out of several friends‚Äô frustration at being bored by going to the same places every time they wanted to spend quality free time in a social setting. Thus, the platform allows anyone with creative potential to showcase their skills to the world while entertaining others and earning some money along the way. When Funzing was launched in Singapore, it first invited participants from different niche communities and forums to become hosts. Saghiv explained that ‚Äúsince the events are generated by individuals and owners of small medium enterprises, it is guaranteed the variety will be unique and different.‚Äù For this reason, Funzing is also being marketed as the \\"Airbnb of experiences\\". Funzing also partners with other establishments and communities.

The island The late Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner, bought the island in 1958 and created the idyllic destination of Mustique. In 1960 media attention rose when Lord Glenconner presented land to Princess Margaret as a wedding gift. David Bowie Britania Bay House, as it was originally named, was built for the British rock legend David Bowie in 1989 in collaboration with architect Arne Hasselqvist and New York designer Robert Litwiller. Bowie craved a property on the picturesque Caribbean island that was far away from the expected, in fact he stated ‚ÄúI wanted something as unlike the Caribbean as possible‚Äù. At the centre of the villa is a koi pond with waterfalls and an infinity pool, surrounded by a series of Balinese pavilions. Bowie was fond of the villa's layout saying ‚ÄúThe thing about Mandalay is that it is broken up into little areas that you can get lost in‚Äù. Bowie spent much time at his unique home on the island, attributing his lack of being able to work there to the outstanding views from the villa, explaining ‚ÄúThe house is such a tranquil place that I have absolutely no motivation to write things when I‚Äôm there‚Äù. Felix Dennis Bowie sold the estate for $5m dollars to business tycoon and poet Felix Dennis in 1994. Felix Dennis renamed the villa Mandalay. Dennis was keen to preserve the villa as Bowie had intended and through the years added numerous details reflecting his own style. Dennis began writing poetry in 1999 after a bout of illness and wrote \\"Island Dreams\\" ‚Äì 99 poems from Mustique with the Laughing Buddha being used on BBC Radio 4's Poetry Please in May 2015. Felix Dennis spent five months of the year on the island and wrote some of his most popular poetry whilst owning the Mandalay Estate. Inspired by the scene as the sun goes down from Mandalay, Dennis wrote: :\\"A ball of fire is spilling in the sea :The empty sky flamingo-pink and grey :Cicada songs creak out the end of day :A choir of tree-frogs whistle: 'Come to me!'\\" Dennis worked with the government of St Vincent and the Grenadines to give each of the 12,500 secondary school children a laptop in 2014. Present day After the death of Felix Dennis in June 2014, the Mandalay Estate was put up for sale and sold to entrepreneur Simon Dolan. There have been numerous press articles stating that the estate is now available to rent for the first time ever, for a reported $40,000 per week. The villa has five bedrooms including one in what was once David Bowie's recording studio and another in the Writers Cottage where Felix Dennis wrote his poetry.

These interactions can be observed through the stringency applied to foreign direct investment policy and the responsiveness of capital or labor incentive for investment inflows. The laws and regulations created by a country that focuses on environmental regimes can directly impact the levels of competition involving foreign direct investment they are exposed to. Fiscal and financial incentives stemming from ecological motivators, such as carbon taxation, are methods used based on the desired outcome within a country in order to attract foreign direct investment. External funding sources that come from foreign direct investment, stimulates the increase of innovative ideas surrounding technological advances while it also holds the potential to decrease unemployment. When financial and fiscal motives are combined with environmental consciousness, the promotion of green and sustainable innovations increases. Such environmental consciousness can result in the decrease of industrial pollutants, which contributes to infant mortality and other health issues. Policies created that attract innovative and environmentally conscious technological advancements have been stated as a great way to encourage increase in the abundance of environmentally friendly foreign direct investments. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development promotes policies that can have positive social and economic impacts. Foreign direct investment does have the potential in initiating negative effects on countries as well. Foreign direct investments allow for the chance of compromise and collaboration between policies of negotiating countries which brings the opportunity for new perspectives on green innovation. However, intensifying regulations around production costs, such as environmental effect, can decrease the attraction of foreign direct investment to that country. Businesses or governments may wish to negotiate with a country with less complicated policies therefore decreasing a country's competitive edge on the international market. Environmental Regulation and Foreign Direct Investment Incentives  A complete list of foreign direct investment incentives that can be applied in regards to international business can be found in Foreign direct investment. Some researchers find foreign direct investment leads to strict environmental policy. Environmental consciousness has been a pressing topic for discussion and concern in the global community as has been seen in the recent Paris Agreement. For a country to become more attractive to foreign investors, one may consider implementing incentives that simultaneously reduce cost while also enabling environmental initiatives. Incentives are policy or regulation measures that are implemented to serve both as a reason to increase foreign direct investment while also maintaining control over the impact investment may have. Fiscal incentives alone, such as taxation laws that aim to reduce the tax burden of a firm, do not largely contribute to attracting foreign direct investment in research and development. Financial incentives direct monetary contributions from a government to a firm; this could include direct capital subsidies or subsidized loans. Incentives that combine both fiscal and financial aspects, have the capacity to increase interest in investment.  Foreign Direct Investment and Environment in Different Countries  = Canada = Canada is part of the OECD, an amalgamation of countries dedicated to working in unison to increase environmental sustainability. Research shows that the total amounts of CO2 emissions have been increasing for Canada. One study shows that Canada is not prepared to avoid the effects of environmental issues that come with economic growth as it does not have a high level of per capita GDP to avoid these negative effects at this time. While another study shows that Quebec which is a major exporter of hydropower, decreased their green house gas emissions by 35%. Since the 1980s, Canada has developed more lenient foreign direct investment policies in order to attract investment. For example, recent Chinese investment in Canada's oil and gas industry has raised concerns that such investments may increase global emissions. Furthermore, Canada is involved in trade agreements over water with the United States such as NAFTA. Researchers argue trade agreements concerning water is affecting the sustainability of water management. It is stated that water governance and management is changing in Canada. There are many commodities that are produced with water, which may increase the competition for water resources and this may affect water security. Canada has been taking preliminary steps to become more environmentally conscious within their trade agreements and environmental regulation policies. In order to address air pollution and its effects on the environment such as acid rain, Canada has partnered with the United States through Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement. Canada and the United States work together to address acid rain issues. Moreover, chemicals and waste industries have economic benefits however also pollute the environment. Canada is part of multiple groups such as United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development and Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, to ensure waste management is effectively managed. In addition, Canada is part of multiple trade agreements to ensure economic growth as well as protection of the environment. Canada has made trade agreements that focus on both labor and the environment with countries such as Chile, which focus on promoting environmental transparency and strengthening the effectiveness of domestic environmental laws and regulations. = China = For the past 30 years China has experienced rapid economic growth. Many studies have been dedicated to documenting the impact foreign direct investment has on the environment in China. However, there have been varying conclusions as to whether or not such investment is environmentally beneficial for the country. Jiajia Zheng and Pengfei Sheng discovered that provinces in the East have higher evidence of market development and lower CO2 emissions while provinces in the West have lower evidence of market development and higher CO2 emissions. It has been documented by the scientific community that there is a correlation between foreign direct investment and increases in China‚Äôs CO2 emissions as energy consumption in the long term impacts CO2 emissions. Researchers found that a 1% increase in foreign direct investment stocks, increase industrial SO2 levels by 0.099%, which shows that increases in foreign direct investment impacts the level of emissions. When market development increases, so do the CO2 emissions. Moreover, sulfur dioxide emissions are said to be one of the main sources of pollution in the air. Some researchers conclude that foreign direct investment does not have negative effects on China‚Äôs natural environment. Studies have shown that the presence of foreign direct investment has the potential to reduce air pollution. Foreign direct investment can be beneficial to China‚Äôs environment as the foreign companies bring more efficient technology which could improve productivity and energy efficiency. China progressed in its market oriented economy as this market oriented reform improved electricity generation efficiency. In addition, cleaner technology helps China‚Äôs environment. Further, there is an openness of trade, which can impact the environment and has been studied. The results found that international trade would raise income, promote consumer spending on environmentally friendly goods and curb emissions as trade openness brings more technology through from developed countries which help the environment. China is taking some steps towards a cleaner environment through policy-making. Studies have shown that environmental regulations have the potential to encourage industrial relocations. China has energy saving and airborne emissions reduction policies which have been stated to help move air-polluting industries. China has accomplished reducing carbon emissions through far reaching efficiency programs as in 2004, the country adopted national fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. Although China is improving their environmental regulations, there is still more work to do such as increasing transparency of environmentally informed national accounts, and the need for greater enforcement. = India = Statistics have shown that although there is a long run, positive but marginal, impact of foreign direct investment in India, the long run growth of foreign direct investment impact on CO2 is even larger. It has been hypothesized that the impact on environment may be larger as CO2 emission is an air pollutant that is typically generated through economic activities. By the turn of this century, India had been named as the 4th highest in global ranking of CO2 emission. Many developing countries desire increased inflows of foreign direct investment as it brings the potential of technological innovation. However, studies have shown a host country must reach a certain level of development in education and infrastructure sectors in able to truly capture any potential benefits foreign direct investment might bring. If a country already has sufficient funds in terms of per capita income, as well as an established financial market, foreign direct investment has the potential to influence positive economic growth. Pre-determined financial efficiency combined with an educated labor force are the two main measures of whether or not foreign direct investment will have a positive impact on economic growth within a country. Since 1991, India has sought to increase foreign direct investment interest within their country by instilling liberal trade and investment policies. Since making these policy changes India has seen an increase in GDP growth rates at 7% annually. However, since the surge in foreign direct investment inflow, pollution emission and resource depletion has been increasing at alarming rates due to greater economic activity (such as the cement, transportation and paper industries). There is hope that as income growth increase, there would be a positive long run effect on the environment as consumer demand shifts towards relatively cleaner goods - this shift would cause pollution-intensive goods to fall, potentially reducing pollution emissions. India, as well as many developing countries, have been experiencing rapid economic development once adopting more liberal economic policies. There is potential for regulation of industrial pollution to increase with further economic development due to the creation of developed public institutions capable of regulating environment depletion. However, until then these public sectors and institutions can be implemented, India will continue to experience increased resource depletion and pollution emissions with increases of foreign direct investment. = Nigeria = Studies have demonstrated that there is a causal link between Carbon dioxide per capita, and foreign direct investment inflow in Nigeria. Foreign direct investment can be critical in promoting growth in the adoption of new technologies, stimulating knowledge transfers, and introducing alternative management practices as well as better institutional organization arrangements. In many Developing countries foreign direct investment is expected to improve the balance of payments. Therefore, in many African countries, foreign direct investment impacts constitutes a key outcome of globalization which can propel them to support and promote liberalization policies. When a country adopts policies focused on liberalization, it aids in the increase of free movement capital. Therefore, long term capital, such as foreign direct investment, could then have the potential to embody adverse environmental consequences. In many globalization discussions, it is argued that environmental quality can be viewed as a good, therefore increasing free trade and foreign direct investment would lead to a cleaner environment. In 1986, Nigeria saw foreign direct investment as a pathway to enhance growth that could span the entire economy and therefore adopted structural adjustment programs for foreign direct investment inflows. Due to the success of the structural adjustment programs, Nigeria has become the continent's second top foreign direct investment recipient, with their oil sector receiving 90% of foreign direct investment inflow. However, Nigeria has demonstrated an inverse relationship between Gross domestic product (GDP) and Carbon dioxide emissions, as GDP per capita increases, per capita emission falls. A decline in the manufacturing sector shares in the country explains the average carbon dioxide emission per capita drop of 0.84 tons from 1980-1989 to 0.41 tons from 2000-2009. It has been documented in numerous studies that developing countries tend to utilize lax environmental regulations as a method of instilling unethical industries from developed countries in hopes of increasing economic gains. Studies have concluded that within Nigeria, although there is a long-standing relationship between quality of the environment and foreign direct investment whereas the same can not be said for foreign direct investment and economic growth. However arguments have been made that although \\"extractive\\" foreign direct investment may not have a significant impact on a countries growth and development, manufacturing foreign direct investment may be more beneficial. There is constant growing evidence demonstrating that the increase of foreign direct investment within Nigeria, leads to further deterioration of their natural environment.

Looking for a fresh face to represent their company, Rajveer goes to a bar, where he is smitten by Tasha. He woos Tasha by promising her to make her a star and hires her for their company. In an attempt to lure her into bed, he pays some goons to attack her so he can swoop in as the hero. As he is paying the goons, someone takes a picture of the transaction. Aryan too is captivated by Tasha's beauty and is able to get her drunk at a party. That night, he sleeps with her, and she wakes up regretting the event.

Vikram is baffled by Rajveer's behaviour when he receives the compromising picture of Aryan and Tasha and the video of Aryan dumping a dead body. He gets a threatening call in which the blackmailer (Tasha) demands that his sons confess to the crime they committed two years ago in India. It is revealed that two years ago, Rajveer tried to force a girl Bhavna (Tia Bajpai) into his car. When a passersby Ashwin (Shaad Randhawa) came to help her, Aryan shot him. Overcome by rage, Rajveer shot him again and again, killing him. In the hospital, Ashwin is declared dead as his sister Natasha (Tasha) and his mother arrive.

Life Born at Carnden, Linlithgow, on 3 February 1782, Kinneir was the illegitimate son of John Macdonald, comptroller of customs at Borrowstounness, and Cecilia Maria Kinneir. In 1802 he was nominated to a cadetship by Sir William Bensley, under the surname Macdonald, which was used in Indian army lists for the rest of his life. By 1818 he himself was using Kinneir. On 21 September 1804 Kinneir was appointed ensign in the Madras infantry, but was not posted until the formation of the 24th Madras Native Infantry on 1 January 1807, when he joined the new corps as lieutenant. He became captain in his regiment on 14 April 1818, and was later brevet lieutenant-colonel. For some time he was secretary to the officer commanding in Malabar and Kanara. Kinneir was attached to Sir John Malcolm's mission in Persia in 1808‚Äì9, during part of which time he was supernumerary agent at Bushehr, and travelled widely. In 1810 he went from Baghdad, by way of Mosul and Diarbekr, to Constantinople, visited Manisa and Smyrna, and returned to England through Spain and Portugal. Then ordered to rejoin his regiment, he journeyed to Stockholm in January 1813 with Colonel Neil Campbell, intending to reach India through Russia and Persia; but after the retreat from Moscow left open a southerly route, he accompanied Campbell to Kilisch in Poland, and then went via Austria and Hungary to Constantinople. After visiting Asia Minor and Cyprus, he returned to Constantinople, and travelled through Armenia and Kurdistan to Bagdad and Bombay. From 1813 Kinneir was for some years town-major of Fort St George, Madras, and resident with the Nawab of the Carnatic. In 1824 he was appointed envoy to Fath-Ali Shah Qajar of Persia, for the East India Company. He arrived at the shah's camp at Ahar in September 1826, during the Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28). Persia was claiming the British subsidy to which by the treaty of Teheran it was entitled, if attacked by a European power; Kinneir would not support the subsidy, stating that the aggression had been on the side of Persia. Military operations followed, during which Kinneir was with the Persian army, until, on 19 October 1827, Erivan Fortress was stormed by Ivan Paskievich's troops. A Russian division pushed on to Tabriz, and the shah's chief minister, Ali Yar Khan, deserted him and fled to Ali Bengloo with Kinneir, who strove to bring about a peace. The Russians accepted Kinneir's mediation, and a treaty was signed at Turkmanchi on 23 February 1828, involving a loss of territory to Persia and the end of the influence previously enjoyed by the British mission. Kinneir received the Persian order Order of the Lion and the Sun and on 17 November 1829 was created a knight bachelor. He remained as envoy in Persia until his death at Tabriz on 11 June 1830, when a period of three months' mourning was observed by the shah. Works Kinneir published: * Gazetteer of Persia, with map (London, 1813) - A geographical memoir of the Persian Empire * Narrative of Travels in Asia Minor, Armenia, and Kurdistan in 1813‚Äì14, with Remarks on the Marches of Alexander the Great and of the Ten Thousand Greeks (London, 1818). Family Kinneir married Amelia Harriet, third daughter by his first wife of Sir Alexander Campbell, 1st Baronet; her elder sister married Sir John Malcolm. She survived her husband, and died at Boulogne in 1860.

The forests are in the transition between the Guiana and Amazon regions, and have highly diverse flora and fauna. They are relatively intact, although they are mostly unprotected and are threatened with deforestation to create cattle pastures.  Location  The Caquet√° moist forests, mainly in Colombia, are in the foothills of the Andes. They have an area of . They are in a region where many rivers flow from the Andes to the Amazon basin. Average annual temperatures range from depending on elevation and forest coverage. The region has some of the highest rainfall in the Amazon region, with an average of , and as much as in some years. On the northeast the forest is bounded by the Guain√≠a (Rio Negro), Guaviare, and Guayabero rivers. In the west it is bounded by the Andes. In the south it is bounded by the Cagu√°n River and then the Caquet√° (Japur√°) River. The forest is crossed by the Apaporis, Vaup√©s and Yar√≠ rivers. The ecoregion adjoins the Napo moist forests to the west, the Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests to the south, the Japur√°-Solim√µes-Negro moist forests to the east, the Negro Branco moist forests and the Llanos grasslands to the north, and the Cordillera Oriental montane forests to the northwest. Geologically the ecoregion lies in the ancient Guiana Shield, but because of its low elevation and long periods of sedimentation the flora are closer to the Amazon basin than the Guiana region. Most of the region is in elevation. The forest contains the Caquet√° River's alluvial plains, their upland terraces, a sedimentary plain from the Tertiary and sandstone table mountains from the Paleozoic that rise to elevations of over . Some soils are rich in nutrients and others are poor.  Flora  The Caquet√° moist forests are in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome of the neotropical realm. The ecoregion is in the transitional area between the Amazon Basin and Guayana forests, and has diverse flora. They are part of the R√≠o Negro-Juru√° Moist Forests, a global ecoregion, the other parts being the Negro-Branco, Solim√µes- Japur√° and Japur√°-Solimoes-Negro moist forests. The reasonably intact global ecoregion has high annual rainfall, diverse soils and varied terrain, resulting in a high level of biodiversity. It has not been studied in great depth by scientists. The forests contain large areas of seasonally flooded forests, including blackwater igap√≥ forests. The lower areas have high forest with a canopy on well-drained soils, low forest with a canopy on poorly drained soils and permanent swamp forests dominated by palms such as Mauritia flexuosa, with a height of . The high forest and low forest both have highly diverse flora. Basal areas of trees range from in the high forest to in the low forest and per hectare in the permanent swamps. In the forests on poor soils, including the igap√≥ forests which are seasonally flooded with blackwater, there is a sparser understory and fewer epiphytes on the trees. The main families of trees are the Leguminosae, Sapotaceae, Lauraceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Moraceae and Lecythidaceae. The Sierra de Chiribiquete is in the center of the region between the Apaporis and Yari rivers, with a maximum elevation of . It has areas of savanna, xeromorphic open vegetation up to high, low forest of and closed-canopy forest with a canopy of .  Fauna  There is diverse fauna, but relatively few endemic species. Some endemic species are Chiribiquete emerald (Chlorostilbon olivaresi), grey-legged tinamou (Crypturellus duidae) and mottle-faced tamarin (Saguinus inustus). There are 189 species of mammals including tapir (Tapirus terrestris), collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) and white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). There are 13 primate species including Spix's night monkey (Aotus vociferans) and white-faced saki (Pithecia monachus). Other species include the golden- mantled tamarin (Saguinus tripartitus), jaguar (Panthera onca) and spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum). Reptiles and amphibians include the yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulata), green iguana (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis species). The Caqueta moist forests are known for snakes such as emerald tree boa (Corallus caninus), fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm vipers (Bothriechis species), common green racer (Philodryas viridissima), coral snakes (Micrurus species), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) and bushmasters (Lachesis muta). 469 birds species have been recorded, including the endemic Chiribiquete emerald (Chlorostilbon olivaresi) and grey-legged tinamou (Crypturellus duidae). Other birds include the plain- winged antwren (Myrmotherula behni), dusky spinetail (Synallaxis moesta), lemon-throated barbet (Eubucco richardsoni) and zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus).  Threats  The forest is fairly intact and stable, although the Nukak National Natural Reserve is the only protected area in the region. There are small settlements of indigenous people in the interior of the forest, but they have little environmental impact. The greatest threat to the ecoregion comes from logging to create pastures for large-scale cattle grazing. Large areas have been cleared to create cattle pasture at the headwaters of the Vaup√©s River. Colonists are moving down the Rio Negro clearing forest for small-scale agriculture or cattle raising. Large areas of forest along the Vaup√©s and Apaporis rivers are being replaced by coca (Erythroxylum coca). During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.16%.

Early life  Fred Maynard was the third child of William Maynard, an English labourer, and Mary Maynard, an Aboriginal woman. Mary Maynard died during childbirth in 1884, after which Fred and his brother Arthur were taken by a Protestant minister, who forced them to work long days, beat them, and housed them in a stable. However, during this time Maynard learned to read and the minister gave them access to his library. In his early teens, Maynard and his brother escaped the minister and moved to their sister's home in Sydney. From this point, Maynard travelled extensively, working a number of different jobs: photographer, gardener, drover and bullock driver.  Political activism and the AAPA  In 1907, Maynard returned to Sydney, working as a wharf labourer in Woolloomooloo. Here, Maynard was exposed to unionist ideas, and came into contact with American and Caribbean Negroes who brought with them exciting new political ideas, in particular, those of Marcus Garvey, the leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association. In February 1925, Maynard and Tom Lacey founded the Australian Aboriginal Progress Association, which advocated for the right of Aborigines to determine their own lives. The decision to create this organisation was heavily influenced by Maynard's own experience of being torn from his land and family in his youth. The Association wrote letters to newspapers and the Aboriginal Protection Board, and in 1927 petitioned the NSW Premier, Jack Lang, for the return of Aboriginal land. During this period, Maynard traveled extensively around the NSW North Coast protesting the theft of Indigenous held land. The Association spread throughout NSW, with eleven active branches. Maynard participated in public debates with public figures in opposition to changes to the administration of Aboriginal reserves. Maynard's vocal and staunch opposition to the Aboriginal Protection Board led to a series of public statements by the Board in an attempt to discredit Maynard. These efforts eventually led to the dissolution of the AAPA. Maynard died from gangrene poisoning following an accident on the Sydney wharves.  Legacy  In addition to his contemporary impact on the efforts of the Aboriginal Protection Board to steal Aboriginal land, Maynard's vocal style of opposition has had a significant influence on successive generations of activists in NSW indigenous communities. Fred Maynard's grandson, Professor John Maynard is a notable Australian historian, specialising in Aboriginal history and the influence of early African-American politics on Aboriginal politics.

It is also known as New St Lawrence Church to distinguish it from the ruined Old St Lawrence Church. History The church was commissioned by Sir Lionel Lyde, a merchant who had a country estate at Ayot St Lawrence. According to Historic England, construction was financed with profits from the slave trade. The architect was Nicholas Revett, the co-author of The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece, a multi-volume publication which appeared from 1762. Revett had visited Greece to study its architectural heritage. One of the sources of inspiration for the church may have been a temple on the island of Delos. Architecture and conservation The style of the church has been described as Palladian, although this is something of a misnomer as, in contrast to Revett, Palladio never visited Greece. Palladio was an expert on Roman architecture, and the Palladian style was derived only indirectly from Greek architecture. There is some debate as to how Revett's neoclassicism should be categorised. Greek Revival is arguably not the ideal term, and some scholars prefer \\"Grecian revival\\". The front of the church with its portico and screens of columns is designed to be viewed from Sir Lionel's home, Ayot House, across a parkland setting. =Interior= The interior of the building has a Greek cross plan. Because of the orientation of the building to face Ayot House, liturgical east and west do not coincide with geography. The chancel and altar are at the west end of the church. Despite the eye-catching facade, the church's interior is relatively small, having a capacity of about 120, which reflects the population of the parish. =Conservation= The building has been Grade I listed since the 1960s. Mausolea On either side of the church is a mausoleum for Lionel Lyde and his wife Rachel. Lyde is alleged to have said of this arrangement that ‚Äòsince the Church united us in life, she can make amends by separating us in death‚Äô. The urns are raised on tall plinths and sheltered by aedicules.

Overview Shell middens have been found in many locations in Japan, and are usually associated with J≈çmon period settlements. The shell middens located on Cape Shiriyazaki are highly unusual in that they date from the Muromachi period, and consist almost exclusively of abalone shells, with an average diameter of around six centimeters. During the Muromachi period, trade been Japan and China flourished, and dried abalone was an important export product, mentioned frequently in contemporary documents. The site consists of a series of 14 shell middens dating from the early 14th to the mid-15th centuries AD. Also on the site were the remains of ovens and the foundation holes for several buildings and wells. Both Japanese and Chinese coins and fragments of both Japanese and Chinese ceramics have been found at the site. These finds led archaeologists to the conclusion that the site was an early factory for the production of dried abalone. It is uncertain of any trade took place directly from this site with China, although the presence of Chinese coins and ceramics raises the possibility.

Built in 1922, it is one of more than thirty architecturally distinguished houses built in Norfolk to designs by Alfredo S.G. Taylor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The John Shepard House is located in a residential area on the north side of Norfolk village. It is set on the south side of Shepard Park Road, roughly midway between Mills Lane and Maple Avenue. It is a sprawling 2-1/2 story structure, built mainly of rubblestone, with a central rectangular section flanked by wings set at an angle. The style roughly resembles that of a Swiss chateau, with heavy dark chestnut clapboards and a recessed porch with balcony above. The roof has a shallow pitch, and is pierced by truncated gable dormers. Windows are irregular in size and spacing, and are typically fitted with small panes. The interior is divided into public spaces in the center and north wing ground floors, bedrooms above those, and the service and servants wing to the south. The house was built in 1922, and was one of the later commissions in Norfolk of New York City architect Alfredo S.G. Taylor. Taylor spent many summers in Norfolk in the early 20th century, and is credited with more than thirty commissions. This house includes a number of his signature features, including the use of rustic stone and heavy woodwork, and the angled wings, all of which appear on a number of his works.

Whilst the taxonomy of the genus is disputed, the genus has been suggested as a biological control agent for Bryophyllum delagoense in Australia. Taxonomy The genus was first identified by the German entomologist in 1877 from species in Madagascar, Nyassa and Port Natal. By 1914, 18 different species had already been recorded from Madagascar. In 1965, Brian J. Selman reduced the size of the genus by 45 species, transferring them to other genera such as Paraivongius, Massartia and Sarum.

In this regard, Stephen served as isp√°n of Pilis County and castellan of Visegr√°d Castle, simultaneously from 1318 until his death. Origin His origin and family background remain unknown. According to a royal charter from 1338, his father was a certain Paul.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (S√°f√°r de Cs√©v family) As a document issued on 30 August 1326 noted, Stephen \\"arrived to the realm along with the king [Charles]\\", while another charter (dated 29 January 1327) suggested Stephen served Charles immediately after the king's arrival in late 1300. Thus it is possible that Stephen of foreign origin accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles from Naples to Hungary. This assumption is confirmed by the fact that Stephen served as envoy of Charles to foreign lands at least nine times by 1326, which assumed he was fluent in French and Italian. Based on land donations and inheritance contracts in the decades of the 14th century between Stephen and his familials, historian Krisztina T√≥th suggested he originated from a lesser noble family which gained their first lands and villages in Po≈æega County during the reign of Ladislaus IV. Following the end of the Mongol invasion of Hungary, B√©la IV donated the entire territory to his wife Maria Laskarina thus Po≈æega County became a permanent queenly estate. In 1281, Queen Dowager Elizabeth donated the villages Als√≥kamarica and Berzince to her courtly youths, brothers Ambrose and Leonard of Po≈æega, respectively. When Ladislaus IV was killed in 1290, his sister Mary, Queen of Naples announced her claim to Hungary. She transferred her claim to his firstborn son, Charles Martel in January 1292. Among others, several Slavonian noble families acknowledged his claim against Andrew III. Many of them left for Naples alongside Charles Martel after his failure. T√≥th assumed Paul, Stephen's father was one of them. As Stephen performed diplomatic duties already in the 1310s, it is presumable that he was born in the 1280s as a contemporary of Charles Martel's son, Charles, who raised as claimant to the Hungarian throne, surrounding himself with Hungarian tutors, pages and courtiers. Accordingly, Stephen learnt Italian and French languages in the Neapolitan royal court, which explains his high degree of language proficiency, despite his social status of lesser nobility. Career Stephen was a member of several diplomatic missions to Naples and the Roman Curia since the 1300s, for instance in 1301, 1303, 1304 and 1309. For his role, he was made castellan of Toppay near the confluence of rivers Tisza and Maros (Mure»ô) (\\"Toppay\\" possibly refers to T√°p√© Castle in Szeged). Stephen functioned as interpreter in that delegation, which was sent to Prague and Zbraslav led by Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi and Simon Kacsics on 18‚Äì23 January 1318 in order to find a bride for Charles, whose previous (first or second) wife Maria of Bytom, had died in 1317. According to the report, John of Bohemia called his two sisters to his court and the Bohemian king gave the envoys the opportunity to choose between them their future queen. Following that Beatrice parted with the Hungarian entourage to her new home. Stephen received his first land donation (the unidentified Hvh√≠z) for this role in that year. After defeating the Borsa clan in Transtisia, Charles I waged war against another oligarch Matthew Cs√°k and captured Kom√°rom (now Kom√°rno in Slovakia) and Visegr√°d in autumn 1317. In the next year the king expanded the estate with surrounding lands (e.g. Szentendre was received from Stephen K√©ki, the Bishop of Veszpr√©m in exchange for domains in Zala County). Although Stephen was first mentioned as castellan of Visegr√°d by a royal charter on 20 January 1321, he was already referred to as Stephen of Visegr√°d in contemporary records since 1318, proving that he held the office since that year, immediately after the reorganization of the castle into a royal estate. Beside that Stephen also served as isp√°n of Pilis County as both functions were connected together at least from 1258. In the first half of 1323, Charles decided to move his capital from Temesv√°r (today Timi»ôoara in Romania) to Visegr√°d, which laid in the centre of his kingdom. The Holy Crown and the coronation insignia were kept in Visegr√°d thereafter too. Since that Stephen became steward of the royal court affairs. His nickname \\"S√°f√°r\\" (lit. \\"steward\\"), which later became the surname of his family, appeared in documents from 1343 and indicated his role as castellan of the royal capital Visegr√°d. Also referred to as magister, Stephen belonged to the courtly knights. He owned a house in Visegr√°d from where his treasury was robbed in 1339. As a result, Charles compensated with land donations worth of 25 silver ducats. Stephen was also involved in the royal chancellery. In 1337, he participated in a Pecheneg land donation in Somogy County, boring the title relator. It is also possible that he served as Keeper of the Seals since the 1330s. As his ancient lands (mainly a part of Als√≥kamarica) laid in Po≈æega County, he gained donations primarily there, including the rest of Als√≥kamarica. In 1333, Charles confiscated the surrounding domain of Koprivnica from the disgraced Z√°h kindred and handed over to Stephen S√°f√°r. Following that Stephen purchased the land Fels≈ëkapronca as part of an endeavor to holding concentration in the Trans-Drava region. After the death of Charles, Queen Mother Elizabeth confirmed his received land donations and granted privilege of tax exemption, including marturina which was traditionally collected in the then highly valued marten skins in Slavonia. Stephen also acquired estates in B√°cs and Toront√°l Counties, as well as in the surrounding countryside of Visegr√°d (including Di√≥sd and Ny√≠rm√°l). On 15 September 1326, the childless Mik√≥csa Rosd, a former familiaris to Matthew Cs√°k, adopted Stephen as his son and made him as his heir. Accordingly, among others, Stephen inherited Cs√©v (today Piliscs√©v) in 1334 and used \\"cs√©vi\\" title of nobility since then. Stephen had real properties in Esztergom and Buda too. Family Stephen had four or five children from his unidentified spouse, who survived him. His eldest son Nicholas I who married into the powerful Aba clan, served as castellan of G√∂nc and Reg√©c forts from 1371 to 1375. Following that he simultaneously held the offices of isp√°n of Borsod and N√≥gr√°d Counties between 1376 and 1384. Beside that he also served as castellan of Di√≥sgy≈ër and D√©des Castles, both were part of the honour to the dignity of Borsod isp√°nate. His another son John I remained manager of the land property in B√°cs County, frequently referred to as \\"John of Szentendre\\" in 1367 and 1379 documents. One of his daughters Margaret married Thomas G√∂ny≈±i, who served as Voivode of Transylvania and Master of the doorkeepers in the 1350s. Anne married Stephen Ibr√°nyi, son of Gy√∂rk from Valk√≥ County. After his death (c. 1345) she became the wife of John Zs√°mboki, the brother of future Palatine Nicholas Zs√°mboki. It is possible that Helena who married √Åkos Mikcsfi, Ban of Slavonia was also Stephen's daughter. His grandsons, Nicholas II and John II rebelled against the rule of Sigismund of Luxemburg and were declared \\"treacherous\\" in 1405. As a result Sigismund confiscated their domains. Gaining pardon later, Nicholas and John was able to recover a portion of their property but gradually impoverished and forced to mortgage their inherited estates. After that the S√°f√°r family effectively lost all political influence and died out in 1455.

Grimsby was returned as Member of the Parliament of England for Great Grimsby in the Parliament of February 1449, and later was appointed to a series of court offices under Henry VI - Yeoman of the Crown (1454-57), Treasurer of the Chamber (1456-60), and Squire of the Body (1457-61). He was returned to Parliament for Lincolnshire in 1459 (the Parliament of Devils), and was awarded some of the lands it confiscated from Yorkist nobles. Grimsby may have fought at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460, and certainly fought at the Battle of Wakefield in December, a Lancastrian victory, and at the Battle of Towton the following March, a catastrophic defeat. He was attainted by the Yorkists, his lands were confiscated and awarded to John Ferriby, and Grimsby fled into obscurity. He was reported to have died in the Marshalsea of \\"black jaundice\\" in 1462, and his wife was allowed to take over her own inherited estates in August 1464. However, he was still alive; in 1462, he was with the exiled Margaret of Anjou in France. He had returned to England by the Readeption of Henry VI in 1470, and may have been returned to the 1470-71 Readeption Parliament. Following the Battle of Tewkesbury in May 1471, he was again reported dead, executed along with other Lancastrian prisoners, but again this was a false report, and he survived to be pardoned in December 1471. He was returned to Parliament a third or fourth time, for Grimsby, in the Parliament of 1472-75, where he successfully arranged for his attainder to be annulled. He rose again under the new regime, being made a justice of the peace in 1475 and securing sinecure posts overseeing the Port of London in 1477 and 1478.

A right-handed pitcher, he played in Japan for the Nishitetsu Lions and the Chunichi Dragons. Tanaka was a top pitcher in Nippon Professional Baseball shortly before scandals derailed his career. A 23-game winner in 1966, he also is one of the few NPB pitchers to ever throw a perfect game.  Biography  Tanaka attended Miike Kougyou High School. He made his NPB debut for the Nishitetsu Lions in 1961, becoming a mainstay by 1963, when he went 17-8 with a 2.66 ERA. That year he was eighth in the Pacific League in ERA, tying for the shutout lead with four. After his successful 1963 season, Tanaka was named the Lions' opening day starter for four consecutive years, from 1964 to 1967. In 1964 and 1965, Tanaka had problems with his control, allowing 102 walks and 84 walks, respectively, both of which were the most in his league. On May 12, 1966, Tanaka threw a perfect game against the Nankai Hawks, defeating them 2‚Äì0 in Heiwadai Stadium. He finished the 1966 season 23-12 with a 2.34 ERA (seventh in the league), a league-leading 217 strikeouts, and 13 complete games, winning a Best Nine Award. Tanaka only won 12 games in 1967 despite a 2.17 ERA (fourth-best in the league) and a league-leading six shutouts. He was traded to the Chunichi Dragons in 1968 (for first baseman-outfielder Isao Hirono), where Tanaka went 11-12 with a 3.41 ERA, and 8-6 with a 3.31 ERA in 1969. Tanaka retired following the 1969 season. = Black Mist scandal = Following the 1969 season, the Nishitetsu Lions front office discovered pitcher Masayuki Nagayasu taking bribes from an organized crime family to intentionally lose games. The team announced that Nagayasu would be released after the end of the season. Late in November 1969, the committee of commissioners presiding over the league at the time voted to ban Nagayasu from the league for life, the first time any player had been banned from Japanese baseball.McKenna, Brian. Early Exits: The Premature Endings of Baseball Careers (Scarecrow Press, 2007), p. 17. In April 1970, Nagayasu revealed that other players on his former team were also involved in game-fixing. The league summoned seven players to testify about their involvement, including team ace Masaaki Ikenaga. Ikenaga claimed to be uninvolved, despite having received 1 million Japanese yen from former Lions teammate Tanaka as an invitation to cheat. (Ikenaga and Tanaka had been teammates for three seasons on the Lions, from 1964-1967.) Later that same month, an auto racer under investigation for rule violations in a race revealed that baseball players were involved in a scheme to fix the results of races. Tanaka was one of a number of current and former players arrested under suspicion of participating in the scheme. As a result of his involvement in both game-fixing and race-fixing, and even though he had already retired, Tanaka was banned from NPB for life. In his later life, Tanaka operated a restaurant and went into health food sales.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

It refers to the practice of affecting reviews or scores on websites that feature crowdvoting, such as online stores or review websites, by calling on large numbers of people to submit reviews, thus boosting or decreasing ratings artificially. This may be done for political reasons, for example, to harm the commercial prospects and credibility of films dealing with controversial or sensitive subjects. Vote brigading is a form of participation bias, which can decrease the reliability of the aggregated score.  Prominent examples  * Free Republic, an Internet forum for conservative activists, is known for promoting vote brigading in online political polls, known as \\"FReeping\\". * The online community Reddit, which sorts its content visibility in a popular voting system, has dealt with censorship issues related to vote brigading.https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq * As part of a promotional campaign conducted in 2012 for a brand of energy strips, rapper Pitbull was to be sent to an arbitrary Walmart store at a location voted for by visitors of the brand's Facebook page.

She has written for Montlake Romance, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, Center Point Large Print, Hallmark Publishing, Waterbook (a division of Penguin Random House), and Crossroads Publishing House. A native of Virginia Beach, she now calls North Carolina home. She began her writing career while working as Senior Vice President for Bank of America. She has since retired from the financial industry and devotes her time to writing, antiquing, cooking, trail riding on her Palomino. Early life In grade school, Naigle wanted to be a zoologist in charge of creating habitats at the zoo in Washington, D.C. However, once graduating from Kempsville High school out of Virginia, she landed in the information technology field and eventually took a job with Bank of America which led to a successful career as a Senior Vice President. Beyond her love for animals and her success in the financial world, Naigle grew up in a creative environment. Her mother was a poet with a couple of songs recorded. Her creative roots surfaced once Naigle found herself in some of life‚Äôs rough patches. It was books by authors such as Jayne Ann Krentz that provided solace for her dark times. ‚ÄúThose books got me from bad to good. They inspired me to write something that could give another woman some strength, a break, or hope. I can‚Äôt solve world hunger, but maybe, just maybe, I can solve a bad day for someone else.‚Äù Career In 2003, Naigle made the firm decision to pursue writing balancing her writing with her position at the Bank of America. In 2011, she published her first novel, Sweet Tea and Secrets, a contemporary romance with a dash of suspense, which kicked off her popular Adams Grove series. Sweet Tea and Secrets hit the ‚ÄúAmazon Top 100‚Äù in Kindle Romantic Suspense, and Naigle went on to publish Out of Focus, book two in the series. Out of Focus, before being published, placed in numerous contests: first place, mainstream/literary category in the Maryland Writers‚Äô Association; first place, mainstream category in the CT The Write Stuff Contest; 2010 finalist, single title category in the Silicon Valley RWA Gotcha! Contest; 2010 finalist, novel with romantic elements category in the San Diego RWA Spring Into Romance Contest). Despite being book two in the Adams Grove series, Out of Focus was written before Sweet Tea and Secrets and is the novel that catapulted Naigle forward in her writing career driving her to continue pursuing writing. In 2012, Naigle signed a four-book deal for the Adams Grove series with Montlake Romance, an Amazon Publishing imprint. Sweet Tea and Secrets along with Out of Focus were re-published by Montlake and Naigle continued to publish four additional books to the series. In August 2013, Naigle‚Äôs box set, authored with nine other authors, became a USA Today Bestseller. A year later, she took an early retirement from Bank of America to write full time, and has since penned multiple series such as the Book Creek Novels and the G Team Mysteries. It was book one, In for a Penny, of the G Team series that landed Naigle back on the USA Today Bestsellers list in June 2016. In March 2017, Naigle‚Äôs Christmas Joy sold to Crown Media and Hallmark for their holiday season programming. This kickstarted a current flourishing relationship with Hallmark. Christmas Joy premiered on the Hallmark Channel, November 3, 2018. A second novel, Hope at Christmas, sold to Crown Media and Hallmark and premiered, November 20, 2018. Naigle has also signed deals for the novelization of two Hallmark movies, Christmas in Evergreen (July 10, 2018) and Christmas in Evergreen: Letters to Santa (July 16, 2019), as well as an original novel, The Secret Ingredient (February 12, 2019) which aired on Hallmark Channel as an original movie in February 2020. Nancy Naigle continues to write small-town romances and keeps her writing diverse by also penning single title novels, holiday-themed novels, short stories, and has co-authored a young adult novel. She is active in several writer organizations including American Christian Fiction Writers, Mystery Writers of America, and International Thriller Writers.

She died in Verbania in Italy. Life and work S√∏rensen's sculpture Pearl Anglais at Gr√∏nlandske Handels Plads in Copenhagen Born in Herning on 14 February 1940, S√∏rensen was the daughter of the manufacturer Niels S√∏rensen and his wife Magda Johanne Benedikte Thomasen. After matriculating from Herning Gymnasium in 1958, she moved to Copenhagen where she became an apprentice with the painter Mogens Andersen. Although she is now a recognized sculptor, she was initially interested in ceramics. Aware that she needed to pursue her studies abroad, in 1959 she went to Paris where she studied at the Acad√©mie du Feu under L√°szl√≥ Szab√≥. The following year she returned to Denmark where she became a student of the ceramist Christian Poulsen in Lyngby. Thereafter she studied in Faenza, Italy, at the Istituto statale d‚Äôarte per la ceramica where she focused on terracotta sculpture. On her return to Denmark in the early 1960s, she was employed as a ceramist by Herman A. K√§hler in N√¶stved. In 1962, she won first prize in the Festival della ceramica in Albisola and, in 1964, she received the Danish annual award for folk art for her new interpretation in ceramics. Designing increasingly abstract works, she began to use other materials such as wood and marble. During the 1970s, she settled in Pietrasanta, the Italian centre for sculpture, where she worked with green granite from Montorfano. In 1977, she moved close to the quarry, adapting her sculpture to the natural markings in the stone. Her talent for adapting her works to the surrounding landscape or architecture contributed to her reputation as one of Denmark's most successful women sculptors, especially in regard to large decorative creations. In 2014 the Municipality of Milan together with the non - profit organisation Cramum and the Danish Embassy in Rome promoted her last solo exhibition \\"1962-1982‚Äú. The exhibition was hold at the Studio Museo Francesco Messina and it was curated by Sabino Maria Frass√† and Andi Kacziba. One of the most notable pieces is her fibreglass and polyester work for the Danish Arts Foundation in 1971 which stands in the atrium of a Fakse nursing home. This was followed in 1974 by a marble sculpture for the residence for Danish students in Flensburg, Germany, and a wood and marble work in T√•rnby. Another of her large granite works is the sculpture over two metres tall in the entrance hall of the hospital in Frederikssund. In 1968, S√∏rensen became a member of the Gr√∏nningen artists' cooperative and in 1979 she was awarded the Eckersberg Medal. In 1982, she represented Denmark at the Venice biennale becoming the first woman to do so since 1948.

Professional Maxson is best known for co-creating Showco in his garage in 1970. Led by Maxson, Jack Calmes, and Rusty Brutsche, Showco would become one of the world's premier live sound providers. The company's client list included most major rock bands of the era, including the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Sir Paul McCartney, Three Dog Night, Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, and James Taylor. In 2000, Showco was purchased by and merged with a competitor, Lititz (now known as Clair Global). As described by Brutsche, Showco's success was predicated on the problem that rock concerts faced: \\"most public address systems were built for the amplification of a single announcer over crowd noise. The dynamics of live music and the power required to generate the sounds we hear at concerts today were almost unthinkable at that time.\\" Maxson later co-founded Vari*Lite, which was one of the first automated changeable color lighting systems for the stage. Through his co-ownership of that company, Maxson won Primetime Emmy Awards for technical achievement in 1991, 1994 and 2001. Prior to developing Showco, Maxson had been president of the Delta Recording Company and Spot Productions. Personal Maxson was the eldest child of John and Virginia DeGolyer Maxson.

Working clandestinely and outside the legal parameters of the French army and police, the 'Barbouzes' used violent terrorist tactics in an attempt to defeat the OAS, but were largely unsuccessful. Origins In the Summer of 1961, when Algiers was under regular terrorist attack from the anti-independence paramilitary organisation, the OAS, three supporters of General Charles de Gaulle met in Paris to discuss their plans for response.Jean Monneret, ‚ÄòLes ¬´ Barbouzes ¬ª Contre L‚ÄôOAS : Nouveau Regard‚Äô, Guerre Mondiale et Conflits Contemporains, 191, (1998), pp.89-116, p.90. Jacques Dauer, Louis Joxe, and Raymond Schmittlein, were the founders of the Mouvement Pour la Communaut√© established in 1959 (MPC, referred to as Mouvement pour la Coop√©ration in Alger) to offer support to General de Gaulle's political ambitions in Algeria.Monneret, p.90 It was agreed that the propaganda posters of the MPC were no longer sufficient and that more drastic action needed to be taken.Alistair Home, A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962, (Macmillan:2012) Lucien Bitterlin was chosen to be the director of the new agents. Bitterlin had been a member of the MPC since its foundation, and had been living in Alger since 1960.Monneret, p.90 Members were recruited from a wide array of French society; existing MPC supporters, former soldiers, and labourers made up the group of several hundred.Monneret, p.91Martha Crenshaw, The Consequences of Counter-Terrorism, (Russell Sage Foundation:2010), p.259 The ‚ÄòBarbouzes‚Äô coordinated with the Police Judiciaire under Michel Hacq, whose team were named ‚ÄòMission C‚Äô.Alexander Harrison, Challenging de Gaulle: The OAS and the Counterrevolution in Algeria, 1954-1962, (Praeger: 1989), p.97 The Barbouzes in Algeria In 1961 the French recruits started to arrive in Algeria. Bitterlin was approached by a French military colonel who supplied him with weapons, gave him permission to breach curfew, and requested he ‚Äúplastiquer several activist cafes in Algiers‚Äù.Home,np. (to plastiquer was to use a form of plastic-based bomb to destroy local buildings, for which the Barbouzes became notorious). Soon, news of the Barbouzes had reached the press. Their membership and political activities, however, were strictly secret, since the French government could not admit knowledge of and involvement in an illegal terrorist group. Since many OAS leaders had emerged from the French military, and therefore had connections with the military and French Secret Service Crenshaw, p.259 the French army and police in Algeria were largely ill-equipped to tackle their attacks. Covert operations were seen as a necessary, drastic means for de Gaulle; the 'Barbouzes' were tasked with \\"infiltrating the OAS, disrupting its operations, and sometimes assassinating its leaders\\".Crenshaw, p.259 Far from attempting to arrest OAS members and hand them over to the authorities, the agents were \\"mandated to kill\\".Harrison, p.98 The OAS claimed to have known about the presence of the 'Barbouzes', having become suspicious about the increasing numbers of MPC posters, the bombing of several OAS cafes, and the sudden arrival of large groups of foreign men into Algeria.Harrison, p.98 As a result, the attacks were by no means one-sided; the OAS orchestrated various attacks on 'Barbouzes' hideouts, including on New Years‚Äô eve of 1961.Harrison, p.99 By the end of 1961, fighting between the 'Barbouzes' and the FLN had escalated. French Prime Minister Michel Debr√© voiced disapproval of their tactics, claiming that Algeria had already seen enough bloodshed.Monneret, p.95 Fall of the Barbouzes In 1962, the 'Barbouzes' were no longer able to maintain their cover against the OAS.Geraint Hughes, ‚ÄòThe Use of Undercover Military Units in Counter-Terrorist Operations: A Historical Analysis With Reference to Contemporary Anti-Terrorism‚Äô, Small Wars and Insurgencies, 24:1, (2010), pp.561-590, p.569 They were eventually wiped out as a result of two major attacks; one on their residence in early 1962, and the second on the Hotel Rajah in February, where the OAS had learned that the remaining 'Barbouzes' were in hiding.Harrison, pp.100-101 Their defeat was not seen as a great symbolic victory for the OAS; after all, the 'Barbouzes' had succeeded in killing only around 100 OAS members, and public opinion largely saw them as no more than a gang of hit men hired and paid for by the French government.Harrison, p.101  References  1961 establishments in Algeria ","title":"Barbouzes"},{"id":"53433194","text":"Frederick Norley (born 23 February 1845) was an English professional cricketer who played for Kent County Cricket Club in seven first-class cricket matches between 1864 and 1865.

In 1733, he composed a comic opera, but his operatic career did not take off. Brunetti earned a living as a singer in Neapolitan churches until he was hired as the Chapel Master for the Duke of Monte Nero, who brought him to Sicily for 6 months, where he composed a serenata for the arrival of Charles of Bourbon in Messina (1735), as well as at least two comic operas on Pietro Trinchera's librettos. For six more months, he taught at the Filipino Oratorio of Genoa, after which he was hired at the Turchini Conservatory as assistant director from 1745 until 1754. At this time, he accepted to succeed Clari, as Chapel Master of the Duomo of Pisa. He stayed in Pisa for almost thirty years and became a priest after the death of his wife, Giuseppina, in 1763.

At least three of the five children of Giovan Gualberto were musicians (among them became famous Antonio and Giuseppe, himself father of another Antonio) and often Brunetti‚Äôs works were attributed to them in the past. Of his musical production, a great amount of sacred music is preserved, much of which is conserved as manuscript copies from the late 1700s. The Duomo Archive (Piccolomini Library and Metropolitan Opera) of Siena (which also preserves his assumed autograph) and the Palatina Library (Biblioteca Palatina) of Parma possess the greatest number of the aforementioned manuscripts.

History SR 325 west of Byrdstown was originally a part of SR 53 that served as a direct route from Byrdstown to Celina, in Clay County until sometime around 1942-43, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers impounded the Obey River to create Dale Hollow Lake. The dam was built just off the current SR 53. The lake‚Äôs formation disconnected the roadway between the two cities, and parts of SR 53 in that area is now under water. After the dam was built in Clay County, SR 53 was rerouted to the Kentucky state line to become a then-new alignment of KY 61, which also followed a path directly into the lake. As a result, the quickest way to get from Celina to Byrdstown is to drive a route from the two cities via Livingston, in Overton County using State Routes 52 and 111.

It is in the Amazon biome. The savanna covers an area of rolling upland plains on the Guiana Shield between the Amazon and Orinoco basins. It includes forested areas, but these are shrinking steadily due to the effect of frequent fires, either accidental or deliberate. The ecoregion includes the Gran Sabana region of Venezuela. Location Satellite picture of the main section. The ecoregion includes three large unconnected areas totaling . The main section is in southeast Venezuela, the Brazilian state of Roraima and western Guyana. To the southeast a smaller section is in the north of the Brazilian state of Par√° extending into the south of Suriname. The most eastern and smallest section is in the Brazilian state of Amap√°, stretching north from Macap√°. There are small isolated fragments to the north of the main section in the Pakarima foothills in Guyana. The main section includes the Gran Sabana region of Venezuela. All three sections adjoin the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests ecoregion to the south. The most eastern section adjoins the Maraj√≥ v√°rzea to the east, at the mouth of the Amazon River. The Guianan moist forests ecoregion lies to the east of the main section and to the north of the other two sections. The main section adjoins the Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests ecoregion to the west. The northern part of the main section adjoins areas of the Guianan Highlands moist forest and Pantepuis ecoregions. Physical The grasslands are between the basins of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. This ecoregion covers gently rolling upland plains of the Roraima formation, sediments that overlay the ancient Guiana Shield basement from the Precambrian era. Soils are typically highly weathered oxisols that are low in organic matter and nutrients and often high in toxic compounds of aluminum. The north part of the main section of the ecoregion is in the eastern Orinoco basin, and is drained by the upper Caron√≠ River, known as the Kuquen√°n, the Yuruan√≠ River and the Arabop√≥ River. The south and east parts of the main section are in the Branco River basin. The rivers are blackwater rivers, acidic and very low in nutrients. Ecology The Guianan savanna ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. Temperatures are relatively stable throughout the year, slightly cooler in July and slightly warmer in November. Average temperatures range from a minimum of to a maximum of with a mean temperature of . Annual rainfall averages about . Average monthly rainfall varies from in November to in June. There are NE and SE trade winds during most of the year. Relative air humidity is generally high, with mean annual levels of 75‚Äì85%. =Flora= The Guianan Savanna ecoregion contains relatively intact grasslands within an area of tropical rainforest and sandstone tepuis. The Guianan savanna contains the Gran Sabana mosaic of grasslands and tree patches. There are continuous forests at the base of the tepuis, and patches of forest or of shrubs in other places surrounded by broad areas of grassland that are usually free of shrubs or trees. Some areas have shrubby meadows. The streams that cross the region run through gallery forests. There is a low level of endemism compared to the Guianan Tepuis. However, the ecoregion is important as a plant refuge and center for plant dispersal. 204 species have been recorded in the Venezuelan Sierra de Lema and Cerro Venamo, including endemic species in swamps in the open savanna, on dry rocky land and in the forests at different levels. Yuruan√≠ River Common species in the scrublands are Euphorbia guianensis, Humiria balsamifera, Clusia species Calliandra species Chamaecrista species, Bonnetia sessilis, Myrcia species and Ternstroemia pungens. Common species in the open savannas are Axonopus pruinosus, Axonopus kaietukensis, Trachypogon plumosus, Echinolaena inflexa, Bulbostylis paradoxa, Rhynchospora globosa and Hypolytrum pulchrum. Common species in the palm savannas are Hypogynium virgatum, Andropogon species, Panicum species, Byttneria genistella, Miconia stephananthera, Mahurea exstiputata and Mauritia flexuosa. Common species in the meadows are Chalepophyllum guianense, Digomphia laurifolia, Tococa nitens and Poecilandra retusa. =Fauna= Most of the endemic birds of the Guianan highland or found on the Gran Sabana. These are mostly found in the humid forest on the foothills above . They include the tepui swift (Streptoprocne phelpsi), tepui goldenthroat (Polytmus milleri) and tepui wren (Troglodytes rufulus). Endangered birds include the sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis), Rio Branco antbird (Cercomacra carbonaria), yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis) and hoary-throated spinetail (Synallaxis kollari). Endangered mammals include the black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). There are relatively few endemic frogs when compared to the tepuis. Most endemic species are found in the La Escalera forest, and include Anomaloglossus parkerae, Stefania scalae, Scinax danae, Tepuihyla rodriguezi, and Pristimantis pulvinatus. Rodriguez's Amazon tree frog (Tepuihyla rodriguezi) is found in savannas and some tepuis. Scinax exiguus and Leptodactylus sabanensis are found only in savannas. Status The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status of \\"Vulnerable\\". The savanna is replacing the forests as a result of frequent fires and the poor soils. This is causing some of the small streams to become intermittent in the dry season, affecting the amphibians. The smoke from the fires may be creating a greenhouse effect, intensifying the heat and damage caused by the fires. Gold and diamond mining cause mercury pollution.

Life He was the eldest son of Henry Lorte of Stackpole Court in the parish of St Petrox, Pembrokeshire. On 3 November 1626 he matriculated Wadham College, Oxford; he had been in the college since 1624, joined in 1625 by his brother Sampson Lort. He graduated B.A. on 11 June 1627, and during the same year became a student of the Middle Temple. On the outbreak of the First English Civil War, Lort aided the Earl of Carbery in promoting the royalist cause in Pembrokeshire. On 19 April 1643 the House of Commons ordered that he be sent for as a delinquent. He eventually made submission, and after consenting to serve on the parliamentary committees for Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, and Cardiganshire, he was freed from all delinquency, and restored to his estate and goods. In March 1649 Lorte with his brother Sampson undertook to victual ships that arrived at Milford Haven or Tenby. Lort was active as a Justice of the Peace and committee man until 1656. When the English Restoration was imminent he declared himself royalist again. He was rewarded with a baronetcy on 31 January 1662. He died in 1664, and was buried in St Petrox church.

At their peak the company had over 39 locations across the United States. Headquartered in Lehi, Utah and founded in 2003, the company declared bankruptcy in 2019 amid accusations of fraud and under an order from Federal Judge Joel Marker closed all locations in February 2020.Carter Williams (Feb 10th, 2020) Utah-based event center company folds, creating havoc for customers nationwide, KSL.com, accessed 2020-02-11  History  The company was founded in Utah in 2003 by William \\"Bil\\" Bowser, the company's CEO as of 2019. The first NOAH'S Event Venue opened in January 2007 in Lindon, Utah. By the end of 2011 the company had a total of six sites. By late 2018, NOAH had over 30 sites nationwide. In February 2019, a manager of nine NOAH's venues wrote to investors, alleging that the company \\"hadn‚Äôt been paying property taxes or insurance on the properties as required under its contract\\". In March 2019, Bowser was quoted as advising investors that about 85 to 90 percent of money from one venue was used as \\"funds for work on other buildings and 10 percent for operations and expenses.\\" The company declared bankruptcy in May 2019 according to The Salt Lake Tribune and is accused of being a Ponzi scheme: investors say they were told their money would be used to buy a site in Carmel, Indiana but allege their money was instead used to pay off earlier investors. Federal Judge Tena Campbell subsequently ruled that plaintiffs were more likely than not to prevail in court, but as of June 2019 had not ruled on fraud allegations. In June 2019, Judge Campbell ordered a writ of attachment for over $800,000 against a property Bowser had sold in Park City, Utah.Bloomberg News (June 26, 2019). Wedding-venue chain founder must fork over cash amid fraud claim, IBJ.com, accessed 11 Feb 2020 On February 7, 2020, NOAH's abruptly closed all of their remaining venues without notice, leaving many wedding couples and other clients scrambling to find a new venue. Judge Marker believed NOAH's was unable to restructure its debt and operate effectively, adding: \\"This company is hurting people and I‚Äôm not going to allow that to continue.\\" The judge and US Trustee managing their restructuring case converted Noah's event venue from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.  Business model  NOAH's operated under a tenancy in common arrangement, allowing individuals to own discrete shares of real estate. Utah- based property broker Rockwell Debt-Free Properties Inc., or a subsidiary, also owned or managed by Bowser, generally acquires a property and leases it to Noah. Noah develops and builds the facilities through a construction arm, Gabriel Management Corp., again owned by Bowser, and then operates the venue. Rockwell sells interests in the property to small groups of investors. The investors collect rent from the sole tenant, Noah, through a property manager. Investors characterize these business practices a Ponzi scheme, which attorney's for Noah's have rejected. Many investors have sold other real estate, for a profit, and reinvested with NOAH's in order to defer capital gains taxes on their sale, in what NOAH's portrayed as a section 1031 exchange under IRS regulation.

The ship was commanded by Captain Balthazar Edison and vanished during a mission in the Gagarin Radiation Belt, an incident later taught to future Starfleet officers at Starfleet Academy. The Franklin is a 22nd-century United Earth starship and is a precursor to the NX series, with the NX-01 Enterprise being the first Starfleet vessel capable of Warp 5, and the Franklin a warp 4 capable ship. The Franklin was built about a century before Captain James T. Kirk's USS Enterprise and is equipped with earlier versions of the later ship's technologies. Captain Kirk remembers that the Franklin had been declared lost shortly after the creation of the Federation and since the ship is eventually discovered at such a vast distance from Earth, Commander Montgomery Scott theorizes that it arrived on the planet Altamid via a wormhole. A major in the United Earth Military Assault Command Operations (MACO) before being made captain of the Franklin, Edison became disillusioned with the Federation, rejecting its principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies. His disillusionment grew when no rescue mission came, believing that the Federation had deliberately abandoned them. Like the NX-01 Enterprise, the Franklin uses polarized hull plating instead of deflector shields, as well as pulsed phase cannons and conventional spatial torpedoes instead of the phasers and photon torpedoes of later starships. It also is equipped with 22nd century cargo transporters that were certified for transport of cargo only. Commander Scott is able to modify the transporter system so that the Franklin can then beam lifeforms safely. Initially, Commander Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy are transported separately to avoid a possible mixing before Scott's further modifications allow mass beaming which is then used to rescue the rest of the stranded Starfleet crew. The Enterprise crew members quickly patch various systems to repair the Franklin and get her flight-ready and then launch her back into space to battle her former captain and his drones at Starbase Yorktown. During the Battle of Yorktown, the Franklin is used to win the fight against the drones but becomes heavily damaged in doing so and eventually, towards the closing stages of the battle, the ship is beached inside the base whilst crushing the few remaining enemy drone ships at the same time. The Franklins dedication plaque lists her as a Starship class vessel. This was the original class of the Enterprise from the pilot of Star Trek, soon rewritten as Constitution class.IMDb Trivia for Star Trek: Beyond References External links Star Trek (film franchise) Star Trek spacecraft ","title":"USS Franklin (NX-326)"},{"id":"53433747","text":"Pool D of the First Round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic was held at Estadio Charros de Jalisco, Zapopan, Mexico, from March 9 to 13, 2017, between Italy, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.Pool D loaded with talent in 2017 WBC  MLB.com Pool D was a round-robin tournament.

The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2017-18 was estimated at recording an annual growth of 8.1%. Growth rate in 2014-15 was 9.2%.In 2017-18, the tertiary sector contributed 85% of Delhi's GSDP followed by the secondary and primary sectors at 12% and 3% respectively. The services sector recorded an annual growth of 7.3%. Delhi is the largest commercial centre in northern India. , recent estimates of the economy of the urban area of Delhi have ranged from $167 to $369 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India. Manufacturing Manufacturing grew considerably as consumer goods companies established manufacturing units and headquarters in the city. Delhi's large consumer market and the availability of skilled labour has also attracted foreign investment. Delhi contributes 4.94% to the total GDP of the country. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers and the city had 129,000 industrial units. Services Key service industries are information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism. Construction, power, health and community services and real estate are also important to the city's economy. =Retail= Delhi has one of India's largest and fastest growing retail industries. = Information Technology = As with other regions of India, the IT industry has been expanding in Delhi. Although not as robust as the IT industry in some of India's southern states, it still hosts significant IT companies such as Google India, Teleperformance India, HCL Technologies, SAP Labs India, Tata Consultancy Services and SAS Institute India. Its satellite cities that fall within the NCR, such as Noida in Uttar Pradesh or Gurgaon in Haryana, are also home to a strong IT sector. According to the Industrial Policy for Delhi 2010-21, the Delhi government hopes to increase investments into and further develop the state's IT and ITeS industries. Delhi's government institutions, well-developed infrastructure, increasing workforce and business-friendly culture makes it an ideal location for such an expansion of the IT sector. The Red Fort =Tourism= Due to its history, central position and status as the nation's capital, Delhi is a common destination for tourists. Some common tourist attractions include the Red Fort, Qutb Minar, India Gate, Jama Masjid, Humayun's Tomb, Lotus Temple, Akshardham and the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Delhi's tourism sector makes up 5.6% of its GDP and the Delhi government considers it to be \\"high growth industry.\\" 62% of tourists and NRIs visiting India come to Delhi. The World Travel & Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated US$3.2 billion or 3.6% of the city's GDP in 2016 and supported 460,300 jobs, 8.3% of its total employment. The sector is predicted to grow at an average annual rate of 10.8% to US$8.9 billion by 2026 (3.7% of GDP). Foreign tourists accounted for 35.5% of all tourism-related spending in Delhi in 2016. The largest source of foreign tourists visiting the city was the United States, which accounted for 11% of foreign tourist visits to the city. = Real Estate = The real estate sector has been another growing industry within the NCR. It boomed in the 2000s and many Indians, induced by the soaring property prices, decided to invest in real estate, especially in the growing satellite cities of Gurgaon, Noida and Greater Noida. At the real estate market's peak between 2001 and 2007, one could expect 20-30% annual returns or double their investment in about 3‚Äì5 years. By 2013 however, demand for real estate began to decline, reaching an all-time low in 2016. With sales plummeting and real estate firms ridden with debt, developers such as Unitech, Jaypee Infratech Ltd. and the Amrapali Group have slowed progress on their development projects since they lack the necessary working capital. Greater Noida, one of Delhi's satellite cities In response to the crisis, the Parliament of India passed the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 to protect home-buyers and the real estate industry. The act created the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) which is responsible for regulating the real estate industry and for addressing disputes for non-delivery. The act also makes it mandatory to register real projects with a clear deadline. This was followed by the Modi government's demonetization of ‚Çπ500 and ‚Çπ1000 banknotes. One of the stated aims of such an action was to curtail the widespread use of black money in real estate transactions. Greater compliance and transparency following the establishment of the RERA has had a stabilizing effect on the real estate market. Although the RERA has made it harder for new projects to launch, curtailing the supply-side of the real estate industry, demand has been increasing. For now, except for Gurgaon which is experiencing marginal real estate growth, home values in the Delhi-NCR region remain stable. = Transport = Another key sector of Delhi's economy is the transportation sector and the city has been investing in transport infrastructure projects. More than half of the population in Delhi is dependent on local transport for commuting purposes. Various methods of transportation thrive in Delhi, including the Delhi Metro, trains and buses. Delhi Metro The city's metro system in particular is a highly efficient public transport system that was initiated by the Delhi and Indian government in 1998. In 2017, the Metro brought in a revenue of ‚Çπ5,388 crore.\\"Annual Accounts And Directors Report 2016-17\\". Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Archived from the original on 3 December 2017. Retrieved 22 January 2018. That said, the Metro has been operating with a loss on an EBITDA basis for the past few years and, as of March 2016, its total debt stands at ‚Çπ291.5 billion. The state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) runs the world's largest fleet of CNG buses and one of India's largest bus transport systems. Buses are a very popular means of transportation in Delhi, accounting for about 60% of Delhi's total transport demand.\\"Chapter 12: Transport\\". Economic Survey of Delhi, 2005‚Äì2006. Planning Department, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. pp. 130-146. Archived from the original on 2007-01-16. Retrieved 2006-12-21. Delhi used to have a Bus Rapid Transit System as well that was a much-vaunted project of the previous Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government however, due to criticisms over poor planning, the Aam Aadmi Party government dismantled the system in 2016. Rickshaws and auto-rickshaws (commonly known as Auto) are also popular. Cheap, environment-friendly and easily available, these rickshaws are used both by Delhi residents going on short commutes and tourists yearning for a joyride. Indira Gandhi International Airport, the primary civilian aviation hub for the NCR, serves Delhi's domestic and international flights and is the busiest airport in India. The airport contributes about 34.5% of the total trade transacted through all major airports of India. It serves as a hub for Air India, GoAir, SpiceJet, IndiGo and AirAsia India.  Employment  As per the Economic survey of Delhi (2005‚Äì2006), Delhi's workforce constitutes 32.82% of the population, and increased by 52.52% between 1991 and 2001. Delhi's unemployment rate decreased from 12.57% in 1999‚Äì2000 to 4.63% in 2003. In December 2004, 636,000 people were registered with various employment exchange programmes in Delhi. In 2001 the total workforce in national and state governments and the quasi-government sector was 620,000, and the private sector employed 219,000. The workforce participation rate for Delhi residents aged above 15 years was 40.8% in 2015-16, lower than the 41.8% recorded in 2012-13.

Elections had previously been planned for early 2019, after having earlier been planned for 10 December 2018. The elections are intended to consist of presidential and parliamentary elections. The four people who agreed to the original deal in May 2018 were: Fayez al-Sarraj (head of the Government of National Accord), Khalifa Haftar (head of the Libyan National Army), Aguila Saleh Issa (head of the House of Representatives), and Khalid al-Mishri (head of the High Council of State). This was supported by the final report of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue for the preparatory phase of the Libyan National Conference, which stated that Libyans participating in the consultative process \\"expressed fatigue and frustration with the current political situation and called for an election or other major change to usher in a new system\\". The elections, to be organised by the High National Election Commission (HNEC), were delayed by the start of a military operation by Haftar's Libyan National Army to take control of the capital Tripoli from the GNA, in April 2019. The Libyan National Conference was also supposed to have been held that month to organise the framework for carrying out the elections. Municipal elections started in March and April 2019 and were organised by the Central Commission of Municipal Council Elections in close cooperation with HNEC.

During the French Revolution, he was involved in the committee that reformed the French educational system. He was one of the founder of the √âcole Polytechnique and its first librarian.  Biography  =Early life= Born in Velay (now Haute-Loire), he was a student at the Coll√®ge of Le Puy-en- Velay. Refusing to become priest, he first enrolled in the Gardes fran√ßaises in Paris. The notorious lack of discipline of this corps enables him to study \\"with the best teachers and well-known scientists\\" of Paris. He then started a career in 1786 as mathematics teacher. =1789-1794 : among the scientists of the French Revolution= He embraced immediately the ideas of the French Revolution. He was a member of the Jacobin Club (Club des Jacobins) and of the \\"council of Paris\\" in 1792. The \\"Biography\\" of Michaud mentions he was \\"an ardent revolutionary\\" linked with activists of atheism (Cloots, Marechal). 1793 was a key year for him. Condorcet in charge of reforming the French Education was banned then executed and the educational system was wrecking. He was the presenter of a project of reform to a commission of top-level scientists including Vandermonde, Berthollet, Fourcroy, Monge, Lagrange. This project was the start for the creation of several high-schools and institutes. He had an important role during the period of the Convention : in charge with Monge and Lagrange to select the mathematics teachers for the newly created high-schools (\\"Grandes Ecoles\\"), in charge to evaluate \\"war weapons\\" and to conduct experiments on \\"projectiles shapes\\". In 1794, he attended a \\"representative of the nation\\" in a survey of \\"coal mines and weapons manufactures\\". The general inspector Monnet (de) met him during this mission and left a description of him in a memoir : \\" an extremely exalted head...and a witty person that never lacks of presence of mind \\". =1795-1804 : creation of the library of the √âcole Polytechnique= Peyrard lived and worked at the H√¥tel de Lassay, where the √âcole polytechnique was hosted between 1795 and 1805 He is appointed in April 1795 librarian of the √âcole polytechnique (official name since September 1795). According to Albert de Rochas he made an excellent work, the library being the place to be in Paris for science research as from 1803. In less than 10 years, he had purchased as librarian approximately ten thousand books. He is also in charge of publishing the Journal of the school. And he starts (likely pushed by Monge) the work for which he will have an international recognition : the gathering and the \\"proper\\" translation of ancient Greek mathematical works. But his exalted, hot-tempered personality, his administrative indiscipline, his unusual way of life (he lives with his mistress), his permanent conflicts with the personnel are a problem for the direction. Guyton de Morveau drives him out from his apartment of the Hotel Lassay in 1803 for \\"lack of social propriety\\", claiming that he was \\"the scandal of the house\\" . In 1804, Napoleon imposes a military status to the school and the new governor, general Lacu√©e, determined to eliminate any trouble-maker, dismissed him in October 1804. He wrote a 54 pages memoir to disculp himself, that was analysed by Janis Langins, in a tribute from the √âcole polytechnique's Library Historical Society (SABIX). =1805 and after= Probably under the recommendation of Monge, he is appointed professor of Math√©matiques sp√©ciales in 1805 at the Lyc√©e Condorcet (Lyc√©e Bonaparte at that time), one of the four recently created lyc√©es of the French capital. Supported by the French Institute (\\"Institut de France\\") and many of the mathematicians he met, he continues his work on Greek geometry, which is now considered as one the major achievement in history of science during the Napoleonic period. His end of career is difficult. He writes in the foreword of the third party of the Euclid's Elements that the loss of his daughter and granddaughter prevent him to work. The Bourbon Restoration depressed the republican activist he was. He died in 1822 at H√¥pital Saint- Louis, a place reserved for destitute people. Work =Mathematical works= The manuscript Vaticanus Graecus 190, its discovery and translation by Peyrard enable to obtain the definitive version of the Euclid's Elements As mathematician, his main contributions are translations of Euclidean geometryp90 of Convolutions in French Mathematics, 1800‚Äì1840 ... Ivor Grattan- Guinness due to his great skills in Greek, Latin, and mathematics. His translations of Euclid's Elements are still considered as the best existing in French. Since 1798, he has published a revised and augmented version of B√©zout's lessons Cours de math√©matiques, √† l'usage de la marine et de l'artillerie. It was the reference and official textbook that \\"encompasses all the knowledge requested to apply for the √âcole polytechnique. It has been printed continuously till 1836. He provided a version of the Archimedes‚Äôs complete opus in 1807. But his masterpiece is the publications of editions of Euclid's Elements that he pretends to have made \\"during his leisure time at Polytechnique\\". He was the first to identify in 1808 a previously unknown manuscript of Euclid called Vaticanus graecus 190, a missing part of Euclid's works, that he dug out of Napol√©on‚Äôs booty from the Vatican. He released in 1814 a revised and definitive edition of the Elements, reviewed by Delambre, Lagrange and Legendre. He wrote in the foreword of the third volume of his translation of Euclid's Elements that he had achieved the translation of the Apollonius of Perga works, that were never published. =Other works= He wrote a philosophical essay (Of Nature and its laws, 1793), translated two books from Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (Female Preeminence.. and Of the Vanitie and Uncertaintie of Artes and Sciences) and the overall poetry of Horace. He is according to Michaud, a contributor to the Dictionnaire des Ath√©es anciens et modernes (\\"Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Atheists\\") of Sylvain Mar√©chal.

Oliver (born February 11, 1986) is an American attorney, non-profit administrator, educator, poet, and political activist. They were a candidate for Mayor of Seattle in the 2017 mayoral election, and finished a narrow third in the primary with 16.99% of the vote. They are widely considered a leader in the Black Lives Matter, civil rights, and criminal justice reform movements in Seattle. Early life and education Oliver was born in Indianapolis to a white mother and black father. As a youth, they witnessed their father serve multiple sentences for failing to pay child support. The experience was a motivating factor for their work countering the injustices of the American justice system. Oliver attended Seattle Pacific University and earned a degree in Sociology in 2008. At Seattle Pacific, Oliver became involved with student government and led a racial justice campaign called Catalyst. They also became involved with the local Black Lives Matter organization. Oliver earned their Juris Doctorate from the University of Washington School of Law in 2015 and Masters of Education from the University of Washington College of Education in 2016. Oliver worked as an intern for ACLU of Washington, intervention specialist, and chaplain at the Youth Detention Center.

Leadership and activism =2017 mayoral campaign= Oliver speaking during their 2017 mayoral campaign Oliver declared their candidacy for mayor of Seattle in March 2017, expecting to run against incumbent mayor Ed Murray, though he resigned due to multiple allegations of sexual assault before the election. Oliver announced they would be representing the \\"Peoples Party of Seattle\\" ‚Äî a collection of community and civic leaders, lawyers, artists, activists and teachers that started organizing after the 2016 presidential election. At the time, Oliver was a part-time teacher at Washington Middle School and Franklin Middle School and provided mostly pro-bono services as an attorney. They also worked for Creative Justice, an arts-based alternative to incarceration. Their campaign focused on a \\"radical rethinking of criminal justice investments; revisiting the city‚Äôs housing proposals to extract more from developers for affordable housing; slowing gentrification; and examining an even higher minimum wage than the recent landmark achievement of $15 an hour.\\" They also brought attention to issues like homelessness, institutional racism, and poverty. =Criminal justice reform efforts= Oliver has worked as an organizer for Seattle‚Äôs No Youth Jail and Black Lives Matter movements. They work as co- director of Creative Justice Northwest, a nonprofit organization that offers programs to youth most impacted by the school-to-prison pipeline. Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Oliver helped organize and spoke at numerous protests in Seattle. During a closed-door meeting with Mayor Jenny Durkan, Police Chief Carmen Best, and other community leaders, Oliver live-streamed the discussion. They have been an advocate for de-funding the police and civic investment in community-based public health and public safety strategies. Oliver has also spoken about outside spending on local political campaigns. In 2017, they were named one of Seattle's Most Influential Seattlelites by Seattle Magazine. They co-drafted a resolution for Seattle‚Äôs divestment from the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2017. In January 2020, Oliver was featured as the keynote speaker for the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration at Edmonds Community College.

It was first used by Mirek Topol√°nek, who designated Klausism as the ideology of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). This term was also used by former Prague mayor Jan Kasl. Klaus himself (a known narcissist) does not take issue with the term. The current usage of the term \\"Klausism\\" has become distanced from Klaus himself, leading to the phrase \\"Klausism without Klaus.\\" Though Klausism primarily refers to the political ideology, it is also frequently used as a label for the neologisms invented by Klaus. Klaus himself used the term \\"Mental Scheme of ODS\\", which he allegedly invented by chance. This term was also used by Jan Kasl. Political positions Klaus is known for his Euroscepticism, climate change denial, homophobia and immigration, and support of free market capitalism. Klaus's stances are often described as liberal conservative combined with national liberalism and Czech nationalism. Jan Pauer described Klaus's political ideology as a combination of \\"Friedmanite monetarism, Thatcherite economic libertarianism, Czech national conservatism and leadership pragmatism.\\" Klaus described himself as liberal, conservative, and pragmatic. Bohumil Dole≈æal believes that Klausism is about \\"fighting against isms,\\" including environmentalism, pro-Europeanism, NGOism or \\"homosexualism\\" (a phrase itself coined by Klaus). It is opposition to perceived trends in Western politics. Klausism is, according to Dole≈æal, a fight for \\"realistic policies that solve problems and do not serve dogmatic ideologies\\". Dole≈æal stated that Klausism itself became one of these Isms. In 2011, Ekonom Magazine likened Klausism to Gaullism, asserting that the two were very similar. Both ideologies support the strong position of the president, but in the case of Klaus it is informal and balancing at the edge of the Czech constitution. Klausism without Klaus Klausism without Klaus was a term coined by Mirek Topol√°nek following conflicts between V√°clav Klaus and ODS. Bohumil Dole≈æal likened it to \\"Socialism with a human face\\". It is often characterised as support for Klaus's ideas but not Klaus himself. Topol√°nek wanted to retain the positive elements of Klaus' legacy and leave out the negatives. Klausism without Klaus was represented by Petr Neƒças, Miroslava Nƒõmcov√° and Tom√°≈° Chalupa. Klausism without Klaus supports economic liberalism, political responsibility, a small state, opposition to other ideologies and the rule of common sense. Podƒõbrady Articles The term \\"Mental scheme of ODS\\" was formulated into the Podƒõbrady Articles in 1998, proclaiming the four principles that ODS supports, including protection of privacy, a small state, a future without debts, and solidarity of responsibilities. Parties linked with Klausism *Civic Democratic Party (ODS) - Klaus is the founder of ODS. Former leader of ODS Mirek Topol√°nek is the first person to use the term. *Tricolour Citizens' Movement (Tricolour; ) - Klaus' son is the founder of the Tricolour and Klaus is the movement's chief foreign policy adviser. *Czech Sovereignty (ƒåS) - The party is supportive of Klaus's views. *Freeholder Party of the Czech Republic (SsƒåR) - The party is close to Klaus's views. *Independence Party of the Czech Republic (SNƒåR) - Party founded by strong Eurosceptic Klausist wing of the Party of Free Citizens.http://institutvk.cz/files/newslettery/74.pdf?rand=33 *Party of Free Citizens (Svobodn√≠) - The party is supportive of many Klaus's views. *Civic Conservative Party (OKS) - The party was described by sociologist Pavel ≈†pl√≠chal as a dead-end branch of Klausism. Neologisms The term Klausism is also used for neologisms coined by V√°clav Klaus. Klaus is noted for his use of language and often invents new words to describe things he opposes. For example, Klaus invented the word \\"Havlism\\", which subsequently entered wider use. Klaus also expressed opposition to \\"homosexualism\\". Other widely used Klausisms are Opposition Agreement or Sarajevo assassination. Criticism Klausism has many critics. Ji≈ô√≠ Pehe called Klausism deviant, and its own worst enemy, noting Klausism's opposition to modern isms, a category to which Pehe believes it belongs. Pehe believes that Klausism is not what Klaus says but what he did when he was in power. He considers Klaus to be very politically flexible and ignorant of other opinions. Pehe suggested that Klausism would be doom for ODS. The leader of the Czech Green Party Ond≈ôej Li≈°ka described Klausism as dangerous for democracy. He called Klausism an \\"ideology of arbitrariness that threatens democracy\\", comparing it to communism due to its, in his opinion, lack of principles.

It sold Duguay-Trouin on 30 October 1783. She then became the West Indiaman Christopher, and later a slaver. She was lost at Charleston in September 1804. French privateer Duguay Trouin was a 150-tonne French privateer sloop of 168 men and 18 to 20 guns, under Pierre- Denis Ducasso. On 29 January 1780, captured Duguay Trouin off the Dodman. The High Court of Admiralty condemned her on 6 March, and the Royal Navy took her in, retaining her name. Royal Navy Commander George Stoney commissioned Duguay-Trouin in May. Then on 29 November she sailed for the Leeward Islands. Commander John Fish took command in February 1781 at Jamaica. Duguay Trouin then had a number of successes: *On 4 March and Duguay Trouin captured the schooner Experiment, of 60 tons and 10 men. She was carrying coffee, cotton, and rum from Jacmel to Curacoa. *Two days later, Diamond, , and Duguay Trouin captured a schooner off Bonnaire that was carrying coffee. *On 25 March she ran a sloop aground and destroyed her at a spot three miles west of Laguira. *On 3 April she captured the schooner De Jussrow Rachel off Bonaire. She was of 60 tons, carried eight guns, and had a crew of 28 men. Her master was Goodman Bon, and her owner Isaac de Mas Chinas, of Curacoa. She had been sailing from Curacoa to Demerara with dry goods. *On 6 June she captured the French government brig La Comte de Vermomiett, off the east end of Hispaniola. Comte, of 40 tons and 59 men, was sailing in ballast from to Cap Francois to Philadelphia. Duguay Trouin sent her into Kingston, Jamaica. *Five days later Duguay Trouin captured the sloop Briliant (or Brillant), of 82 men, at sea. Briliants master was Joseph Marsham, and her owner was \\"Castile\\", of Aux Cayes. The large crew indicates that she was a privateer. In August, Commander Benjamin Hulke replaced Fish. On 12 February 1783, a three-ship flotilla, headed by the 28-gun corvette La Coquette under the command of the Marquis de Grasse-Brian√ßon (nephew to Admiral Comte de Grasse) arrived at Grand Turk Island. The flotilla disembarked about 400 men, drawn from four regiments, under the command of M. de Coujolles, who took control of the island without resistance. On 2 March the 44-gun , under the command of Captain James King, while sailing in company with Duguay Trouin, discovered two of the French ships anchored in Turks Island passage. On being spotted the two ships cut their cables and stood to the southwest, upon which Resistance gave chase. The rearmost ship, carrying 20 guns, sprang her main topmast; she surrendered after Resistance came up and fired a broadside. Resistance then gave chase to the other, and after enduring fire from her stern chasers, came alongside; La Coquette promptly surrendered. On 15 March Deguay Trouin captured Ville de Trieste. =Disposal= After the American War of Independence and the war with France had ended, the Navy sold Duguay Trouin on 30 October 1783. Christopher One or more merchants purchased Duguay Trouin and registered her on 2 December 1784 under the name Christopher. The merchant may have been the Liverpool merchant John Bolton. Christopher enters Lloyd's Register in 1786 (there is no issue for 1785), with J. Bolton owner, T. Scott, master, changing to J. Smith, and trade Liverpool-St Vincent.Lloyd's Register (1786), Seq. ‚ÑñC264. Bolton was still Christophers owner in 1786 in the Liverpool Registry. Captain James Smith received a letter of marque for her on 19 September 1793.\\"Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793-1815\\"; p.56 Under his command she captured three French vessels with produce from the West Indies, and a privateer from Martinique of 12 guns and 44 men. Smith brought into St Vincent a vessel from Guadeloupe that was carrying 150 hogsheads of sugar.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2595. (Whether his was one of the three French vessels already alluded to or not is impossible to say.) Captain John Tomkinson replaced Smith on 23 October 1794, and Captain Henry Bond replaced Tomkinson on 20 July 1795 at Grenada. Robert Ramsey took command on 6 October 1797. He received a letter of marque on 10 October. Lloyd's Register for 1798 has J. Watson replacing \\"R.

He gathered slaves from somewhere other than the usual places that British slavers frequented, and then carried them too to British Guiana. In 1801 Christopher was almost rebuilt. In 1802 Christopher, John Hurd (or J. Hird), master, sailed to Sierra Leone. She delivered her slaves to Trinidad. Because this voyage and the next began during the Peace of Amiens, Hurd did not sail under a letter of marque. In 1803 Christopher, John Hurd (or J. Hird), master, gathered his slaves from somewhere other than the usual places that British slavers frequented. He carried his slaves to Tortola. Robert Woodward received a letter of marque on 15 February 1804. He then gathered slaves around West Central Africa and St. Helena, and carried them to South Carolina.

It lies on the watershed between the Orinoco and Rio Negro basins. It includes both blackwater and whitewater rivers, creating different types of seasonally flooded forest. The vegetation is more typical of the Guiana region than the Amazon.  Location  The ecoregion has an area of It overlays the Casiquiare Rift. The center of the ecoregion is in the extreme south of Venezuela, and covers part of the Parima Tapirapec√≥ National Park. It extends west into Colombia, where it includes the south of El Tuparro National Natural Park, and extends to the southeast into the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Roraima, including part of the Pico da Neblina National Park. It adjoins the Caqueta and Japur√°-Solim√µes- Negro moist forests to the south, the Llanos grasslands to the north, the Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests to the east and the Uatuma- Trombetas moist forests to the southeast. It also adjoins or contains areas of Rio Negro campinarana.  Hydrology  The Negro-Branco moist forests ecoregion is on the watershed between the Orinoco in Venezuela and the Rio Negro, which is known as the Guain√≠a River in Colombia and is a major tributary of the Amazon River. Rivers include nutrient-poor clearwater and blackwater rivers, the latter type stained dark by tannin, and nutrient-rich whitewater rivers. The blackwater Vichada River forms the northern border in Colombia, and the clearwater Ventuari River forms the northern border in Venezuela, both tributaries of the Orinoco. In Colombia the whitewater Guaviare and In√≠rida rivers are in the Orinoco Basin. The southern border in Colombia is defined by the middle Guaviare and by the upper reaches of the blackwater Guain√≠a / Rio Negro to the Venezuela-Colombia border. In Venezuela the blackwater Casiquiare canal, a distributary of the Orinoco, feeds the Guainia/Negro River. The Rio Negro defines the southern border in Brazil to the whitewater Rio Branco.  Environment  The ecoregion is on the ancient Guiana Shield, a craton formed in the Precambrian. Elevations range from in the west to over in the east in Venezuela. Terrain includes lowland plains, rolling hills and low sandstone plateaus. Until recently the lowland plains of the region were covered in lakes and seas, which deposited layers of sediment. Soil types are generally poor in nutrients, mainly podzols on the old alluvial terraces. The ecoregion is part of the R√≠o Negro-Juru√° Moist Forests, a global ecoregion, the other parts being the Caqueta, Solim√µes-Japur√° and Japur√°- Solimoes-Negro moist forests. The reasonably intact global ecoregion has high annual rainfall, diverse soils and varied terrain, resulting in a high level of biodiversity. It has not been studied in great depth by scientists. = Flora = The endemic piassava palm. 1874 illustration by Walter Hood Fitch. The Negro-Branco moist forests are in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome of the neotropical realm. Vegetation includes flooded and terrra firme lowland moist forest, tall or medium-tall campinarana lowland forest, patches of shrubs and herbaceous savanna-like meadows. Forests are typical of the Guiana region, with a different mix of plants from the classical Amazon rainforest. Humiriaceae, Rapateaceae, Tepuianthaceae, Theaceae and Xyridaceae are common families that do not belong to the Amazon flora. The forests hold relatively few epiphytes or lianas compared to other parts of the western Amazon region. The flat Casiquiare peneplain in Venezuela holds forests, savannas and other formations. It contains blackwater and whitewater rivers, which create igap√≥ and v√°rzea forest along their flooded banks. There are seasonally flooded and terra firme evergreen lowland forests reaching , and low evergreen flooded palm forests that reach . The dominant trees of the low palm forests are Mauritia flexuosa, Mauritiella aculeata and dense groups of Euterpe catinga, Iriartea setigera and Socratea exorrhiza. The terra firme forest holds Lecointea amazonica, Clathrotropis glaucophylla, Peltogyne venosa, and species in the Ocotea, Nectandra, Licania, Trichilia, Guarea, Toulicia, Erisma and Ruizterania genera. The tall canopy forests also hold trees of the Oenocarpus, Socratea, Leopoldinia and Bactris genera. There are patches of campinarana on white sands near the border of Venezuela and Colombia. There is a high level of endemism of flora including the genera Duckeanthus, Heteropetalum, Pseudephedranthus, Urospathella, Aquiaria, Angostylis, Astrococcus and Chonocentrum. The economically valuable palm Leopoldinia piassaba is endemic to the ecoregion. In the Rio Negro basin the many blackwater streams and small rivers flood a large area of igap√≥ forest for 5‚Äì6 months each year. The canopy is up to high. Common species are Virola elongata, Eschweilera longipes, Eschweilera pachysepala, Aldina latifolia and Pithecellobium amplissimum. = Fauna = The golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus) is endemic to the Negro-Branco moist forests. There are 194 species of mammals, including a few endemic species such as golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), Tschudi's slender opossum (Marmosops impavidus), least big-eared bat (Neonycteris pusilla), Guianan spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus latifolius), Eldorado broad-nosed bat (Platyrrhinus aurarius), Venezuelan fish-eating rat (Neusticomys venezuelae), MacConnell's climbing mouse (Rhipidomys macconnelli), the guinea pig Cavia guianae and Simon's spiny rat (Proechimys simonsi). Common species include South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis), bush dog (Speothos venaticus) and three species of small cats of the Leopardus genus. There are many reptiles and amphibians. Snakes include fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis species), coral snakes (Micrurus genus), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) and bushmasters (Lachesis muta). There are many green iguanas (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis genus). 486 species of birds have been recorded, a relatively low number for the Amazon region. They include the endemic grey-legged tinamou (Crypturellus duidae), crestless curassow (Mitu tomentosum), double-striped thick-knee (Burhinus bistriatus), oilbird (Steatornis caripensis), tawny- tufted toucanet (Selenidera nattereri), Orinoco piculet (Picumnus pumilus), Yapacana antbird (Myrmeciza disjuncta), gray-bellied antbird (Myrmeciza pelzelni), spot-tailed nightjar (Hydropsalis maculicaudus), azure-naped jay (Cyanocorax heilprini), and white-naped seedeater (Dolospingus fringilloides).  Threats  The ecoregion covers most of the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve. A small part of the ecoregion is in the Pico da Neblina National Park. There are few threats to the ecoregion, which is inaccessible and has no roads. The forest is largely intact. People in riverine communities engage in small-scale rotation agriculture. There is some low-level logging and in some areas the understory is routinely burned by Brazil nut collectors. Leaves of the Leopoldinia piassaba palm are harvested to make brooms for sale internationally, and this may be unsustainable.

It has been practiced in Africa (Mozambique, South Africa), Asia (Indonesia, Thailand), and Central America (among the Q'eqchi' people). Vaginal steaming is described in spas as an ancient Korean treatment for reproductive organ ailments and is claimed to have other benefits. No empirical evidence supports any of these claims. It has become a fad for women in the Western world. In a paper for Culture, Health & Sexuality, Vandenburg and Braun argue that the rhetoric of vaginal steaming mirrors includes sexist Western discourse about the supposed inherent dirtiness of the female body, and that its claims of improved fertility and sexual pleasure continue the view that the female body exists for male sexual pleasure and childbearing. There is no evidence that vaginal steaming has any benefits, while there is evidence to show it can be dangerous. Prevalence According to a study on vaginal practices by the World Health Organization published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by \\"Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke\\". For that study, over 4,000 women in Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, \\"which they associated with maintaining wellness and feminine identity\\", especially after having given birth (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, \\"mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)\\". In the two African locations, 37‚Äì38% of women said they practiced it to enhance \\"male sexual pleasure\\"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their \\"feminine identity\\" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women. Risks Side effects and potential dangers include: allergic reactions, second-degree burns if the steam is too close, and vaginal infections. Society and culture =Marketing= Vaginal steaming is marketed with pseudoscientific notions of \\"balancing\\" female hormones and \\"revitalizing\\" the uterus or vagina. It is also marketed as \\"cleaning\\" the vagina, which it does not do. In an article for Goop, actress Gwyneth Paltrow in reviewing a Santa Monica, California spa, described several of their treatments and said of one, \\"[y]ou sit on what is essentially a mini-throne, and a combination of infrared and mugwort steam cleanses your uterus, et al\\". A report in The Guardian responded by debunking the claim of the heat, steam, and mugwort having any benefit, and noted it could be harmful. A 2017 survey by Vandenburg and Braun (taking as its title one observer's characterization\\"Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina\\") analyzed \\"90 online items related to vaginal steaming\\", including from newspapers and magazines, blogs, and providers of the practice. They identified a general theme, that of the \\"self-improving woman\\", which they argue fits in perfectly with modern constructions of what scholarship has called the \\"neoliberal\\" woman, a woman who, free of outside influences, seeks to optimize herself and her health (see Healthism). Within that theme, they found four attitudes that promote healthist practices such as vaginal steaming: # The female body is inherently defective and dirty, and deteriorates with age: \\"the female body [is] situated within this biologically-determinist narrative of inevitable decline\\" which can be resisted. # Western medicine and bodily care (including tampon use, for instance) make the female genitalia unnaturally full of toxins, a process that can be reversed by the natural practice of vaginal steaming (the authors note that such accounts are themselves littered with language derived from Western medicine‚Äî\\"symptoms\\", \\"decline\\", \\"ailments\\"). # Health enhancement, and the optimization of the body, specifically fertility and sexual pleasure, with much of the language used by advertisers of spas focusing on \\"maintenance\\" and \\"restoration\\", reinforcing both healthism and the fetishization of youth; vaginal steaming, it is claimed, improves marriages and the male libido. According to the authors, \\"the sexual and reproductive enhancement focus mirrors the two modes through which Western societies have traditionally valued women: sexual availability for men (within marriage) and childbearing\\". # The pampering of the self-assured woman, a luxury as well as a right that they have earned, with advertising playing on the \\"reawakening\\" of the \\"inner goddess\\": \\"To awaken your inner goddess, please call us at...\\" The idea is that the practice allows a woman to reach her true potential, her true self. The authors conclude that vaginal steaming is one of many practices that fit \\"neoliberal, postfeminist and healthist ideologies, colliding with pervasive sociocultural understandings of the female reproductive body both as core of womanhood and as 'embodied pathology.

Early life and education Krein was raised in Eureka, South Dakota, the son of Gary and Nancy Krein. He has one sister. He graduated from Eureka High School in 2004. He is a 2008 graduate of Harvard College, where he studied political philosophy with Harvey Mansfield. Career Krein went into a career in finance, working for Bank of America and the Blackstone Group. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he was employed at a hedge fund based in Boston while also contributing as a writer and site administrator for a pro-Trump blog. The blog, known as the Journal for American Greatness, was created supposedly to support Trump on the basis that his beliefs were politically sound. The blog's owners eventually took it offline, claiming it had begun as an inside joke and they were not prepared for such large readership. Its popularity led to Krein deciding to leave his day job to launch an authentic publication, American Affairs, a quarterly journal intended to support Trump from an intellectual perspective, he described it as an effort \\"to give the Trump movement some intellectual heft.\\" Six months later, however, Krein publicly withdrew his support for Trump in a piece published in the New York Times, expressing regret over his prior support of Trump as president. The inaugural issue of American Affairs was released February 21, one month after Trump's inauguration, which Krein intended to be the first of four issues for 2017. In an interview before its release, Krein stated he planned to have several dozen contributors and for each issue to include about 10 essays. The first issue included features on \\"the failure of standard conservative ideology,\\" nationalism, fusionism, and academic free market theory. The issue received mixed reviews. Denunciation of Trump On August 17, 2017, following Trump's reaction to the events of the Charlottesville \\"Unite the Right\\" rally, Krein wrote an op-ed in The New York Times entitled \\"I Voted for Trump and I Sorely Regret It\\". Krein's public denunciation of Trump, in which he encouraged others to do the same, attracted significant media attention. In his op-ed, he lamented that he and his fellow Trump supporters were guilty of \\"deluding ourselves\\" during the 2016 election and that Trump's harshest critics had been proven right. In an interview with Slate, Krein further explained how he had rationalized his public support for Trump prior to the Charlottesville rally. Krein stated that he did not feel Trump was legitimately racist. He told Slate, \\"I didn‚Äôt think the racist stuff was real. I thought it was media provocation. And that the economic or other stuff‚Äîthat‚Äôs what he really cared about, and we are not electing a Pope, we are electing a president. If he gets even a couple things done, it‚Äôs good for the country, and by the way good for everybody.\\" Political beliefs Krein stated that he identifies himself as a conservative and a nationalist, but absolutely not a white nationalist. He also explained that he was very disillusioned with the Republican Party leadership, and that he felt Reaganomics had been a failure: > \\"To go back to nationalism, the biggest problem is the Republican mindset, > the Reaganite mindset that we are all just individuals and let everyone > loose to acquire wealth. That hasn't worked. Not only do we have rising > inequality, but the people who defend rising inequality say it will lead to > more productivity and the pie is going to be bigger blah blah.

Originally ordered by the Eyalet of Egypt but confiscated by the Ottoman Empire while under construction, the vessel was initially named Kahira. The ship was laid down at the French Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard in 1867, was launched in 1868, and was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet in March 1870. Asar-i ≈ûevket was armed with a battery of four Armstrong guns in a central casemate and one Armstrong gun in a revolving barbette. The ship saw action in the Russo-Turkish War in 1877-1878, where she supported Ottoman forces in the Caucasus, and later helped to defend the port of Sulina on the Danube. She was laid up for twenty years, until the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. Asar-i ≈ûevket was not included in the major reconstruction program that saw most of the other ironclads rebuilt after the war, and she was decommissioned in 1903 and broken up for scrap in 1909. Design Asar-i ≈ûevket was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The hull was constructed with iron, incorporated a ram bow and a partial double bottom. She displaced normally.

Asar-i ≈ûevket carried of coal. A supplementary brig rig was also fitted. Asar-i ≈ûevket was armed with a battery of one muzzle loading Armstrong gun and four Armstrong guns. The 178 mm guns were mounted in a central, armored battery, with the 229 mm gun on top in an open barbette mount. The ship's armored belt consisted of wrought iron that was thick and was reduced to toward the bow and stern. Above the main belt, a strake of armor 114 mm thick protected the central battery, and the same thickness was used for the barbette. Service history Asar-i ≈ûevket, meaning \\"Work of God\\", was originally ordered by the Eyalet of Egypt, a province of the Ottoman Empire, in 1866 from the French Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard in Bordeaux under the name Kahira. Her keel was laid down in 1867, and she was launched the following year. Egyptian efforts to assert their independence angered Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, who, on 5 June 1867, demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations the vessel was formally transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 29 August 1868. The ship was then renamed Asar-i ≈ûevket and commissioned into the Ottoman Navy on 3 March 1870. Upon completion, Asar-i ≈ûevket and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals. Asar-i ≈ûevket was assigned to the I Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. =Russo- Turkish War= Russian painting of the attack on Asar-i ≈ûevket, depicting her supposed sinking The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war. By this time, Asar-i ≈ûevket had been transferred to the I Division in the Mediterranean Fleet, but she was quickly transferred to the Black Sea squadron, with the bulk of the Ottoman ironclad fleet. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, was vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the eastern Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi. In May, Asar-i ≈ûevket, the steam frigate , and several transport ships steamed to Batumi. Over the course of the war, Russian torpedo boats made several attacks on the vessels stationed in Batumi, but Asar-i ≈ûevket was not damaged in any of them. By the end of June, Asar-i ≈ûevket was transferred to the port of Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, along with the ironclads and Hifz-ur Rahman. The ships were tasked with defending the seaward approach to the port, supporting three coastal fortifications. By August, the ship had been transferred to Sukhumi. There, on the night of 24 August, four Russian torpedo boats launched an attack on the ships in the harbor. One of the boats succeeded in detonating its spar torpedo under Asar-i ≈ûevkets hull and claimed to sink her, but the ironclad was undamaged in the attack. =Later career= After the end of the war in 1878, Asar-i ≈ûevket was laid up in Constantinople. This was in part due to chronically low budgets, and in part due to the fact that the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, who had come to power after a coup deposed Murad V that involved senior members of the Navy, distrusted the Navy. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Asar-i ≈ûevket was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . In 1890, the ship was taken to the Imperial Arsenal for refitting, and new boilers were installed. The ship also received a battery of light guns, including two Krupp guns, two Krupp guns, two Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and one Nordenfelt gun. The ship returned to service on 12 February 1892. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Asar-i ≈ûevket, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Many of the ships had rotted hulls and their crews are poorly trained. Through April and May, elements the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. During these operations, Asar-i ≈ûevket and the rest of the ironclad fleet ventured no further than Naga, the narrowest point of the Dardanelles. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, and Asar-i ≈ûevket was not included in the program. Instead, the ship was decommissioned in 1903 and was ultimately sold to ship breakers on 31 July 1909.

Necm-i ≈ûevket was assigned to the I Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. =Russo-Turkish War= The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war. Necm-i ≈ûevket spent the war in the Black Sea squadron, with the bulk of the Ottoman ironclad fleet. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, was vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the eastern Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi. On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Necm-i ≈ûevket and the ironclads , , , , and bombarded Russian positions around the Black Sea port of Sokhumi before landing infantry and arming the local populace to start an uprising against the Russians. The Ottomans captured Sokhumi two days later. Over the course of the war, Russian torpedo boats made several attacks on the vessels stationed in Batumi, but Necm-i ≈ûevket was not damaged in any of them. The Ottoman fleet continued to support the Ottoman garrison at Batumi, when held out against constant Russian attacks to the end of the war. =Later career= After the end of the war in 1878, Necm-i ≈ûevket was laid up in Constantinople. This was in part due to chronically low budgets, and in part due to the fact that the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, who had come to power after a coup deposed Murad V that involved senior members of the Navy, distrusted the Navy. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Necm-i ≈ûevket was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attach√© to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . In 1890, the ship was taken to the Imperial Arsenal for refitting, and new boilers were installed. The ship also received a battery of light guns, including two Krupp guns, two Krupp guns, two Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and one Nordenfelt gun. The ship returned to service on 12 February 1892. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Necm-i ≈ûevket was assigned to the II Squadron. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Necm-i ≈ûevket, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Many of the ships had rotted hulls and their crews were poorly trained. Necm-i ≈ûevket was one of two ironclads found to be in usable condition, the other being . In April and May, the ship escorted troopships transporting infantry from western Anatolia to Gelibolu, and while conducting these operations, she took part in gunnery exercises. On 15 May, Necm-i ≈ûevket and the ironclads Mesudiye, , , and , along with several other vessels conducted a major training exercise, where severe deficiencies in the level of training were revealed, particularly with the men's ability to operate the ships' guns. In September 1897, the war came to an end, and the Ottoman fleet returned to Constantinople. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau- Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, and Necm-i ≈ûevket was not included in the program. Instead, the ship was employed as a stationary ship based in Selanik from 1899 to 1909, at which point she was converted into a barracks ship in Constantinople. On 30 October 1912, during the First Balkan War, Necm-i ≈ûevket was reactivated to stop the Bulgarian advance against the Ottoman defenders at √áatalca. She was joined by the ironclad Iclaliye; both vessels had to be towed into place, and they remained in their firing positions for only a few days. The two ships, joined by the pre-dreadnought battleships and and the modernized Mesudiye and Asar-i Tevfik, were towed to B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece, where they remained from 15 to 20 November, though they made little contact with Bulgarian forces. The ship resumed her barracks ship duties after the war and was decommissioned in 1929 and was thereafter broken up.

Creation of Flutter  Flutter is the story of a teenage girl who shape-shifts into a boy to get her dream girl because her dream girl is straight. Series creator Jennie Wood said in a 2015 interview with The New York Times that the story came from her imagining that life would be better as a guy. In a 2013 interview with Mic, Wood said the story was based on her own experiences growing up in a small southern town. She worked in a movie theater while in high school where she would watch guys bring girls to the movies. Wishing she could bring a girl to the movies, Wood began daydreaming about what it would be like to be a boy. Those daydreams led to Flutter. In 2008, series creator Jennie Wood began developing Flutter. By 2010, she was working with artist Jeff McComsey. Together, the duo self-published the first issue in 2011. Soon after, 215 Ink offered to publish the comics as a full color graphic novel series. 215 Ink published Flutter, Volume One: Hell Can Wait in March 2013.

History The first member of the family was Stephen I, a well-trained diplomat of Charles I of Hungary since the 1300s, who was fluent in French and Italian, despite his commoner or lower noble status. A royal charter from 1326 writes Stephen \\"arrived to the realm along with the king [Charles]\\", while another charter dated 1327 suggested Stephen served Charles immediately after the king's arrival in late 1300. Based on certain land donations, historian Krisztina T√≥th considered Stephen originated from a lesser noble family which gained their first lands and villages in Po≈æega County during the reign of Ladislaus IV. Accordingly, Stephen's father Paul supported Charles Martel and acknowledged his claim to the Hungarian throne against Andrew III. After the failure, this Paul might be one of those lords who followed Charles Martel to Naples. According to this theory, Stephen raised in the Neapolitan court as Martel's son Charles surrounded himself with Hungarian tutors, pages and courtiers. Returning Hungary, Stephen was a member of several diplomatic missions to Naples and the Roman Curia. Following the recapture of Visegr√°d in autumn 1317, Stephen was appointed its castellan. In 1323, Charles selected Visegr√°d as the new capital of the kingdom. Since that Stephen became steward of the royal court affairs as castellan of Visegr√°d. His nickname \\"S√°f√°r\\" (lit. \\"steward\\"), which later became the surname of his family, first documented appearance from 1343. Stephen gained his first land donations in 1318, (re)promoting to the Hungarian nobility. Stephen had four or five children: his daughters married to influential barons who held national dignities during the rule of Louis I of Hungary. His elder son Nicholas I served as castellan of G√∂nc and Reg√©c forts from 1371 to 1375. Following that he simultaneously held the offices of isp√°n of Borsod and N√≥gr√°d Counties between 1376 and 1384. Beside that he also served as castellan of Di√≥sgy≈ër and D√©des Castles, both were part of the honour to the dignity of Borsod isp√°nate. The family lost its all political influence, when Nicholas I's two sons, Nicholas II and John II rebelled against the rule of Sigismund of Luxemburg and were declared \\"treacherous\\" in 1405. As a result Sigismund confiscated their domains. Gaining pardon later, Nicholas and John was able to recover a portion of their property but gradually impoverished and forced to mortgage their inherited estates. Nicholas I's only daughter Dorothea I married Paul Per√©nyi from the Rihn√≥ branch, who acquired most of the S√°f√°r estates from his brothers-in-law. After four generations, the S√°f√°r family became extinct, when Ladislaus II, the last male member of the family died without heirs in 1455.

Water levels varied through its history, and the chronology is further complicated by active tectonic processes that have modified the elevations of the various shorelines of Lake Manly; during the Blackwelder stage they reached above sea level. The lake received water mainly from the Amargosa River and at various points from the Mojave River and Owens River. The lake and its substantial catchment favoured the spread of a number of aquatic species, including some lizards, pupfish and springsnails. The lake probably supported a substantial ecosystem, and a number of diatoms developed there. In Death Valley, lakes existed during different times in the geological past. After some poorly defined lake stages during the Miocene, Pliocene and early Pleistocene, the first large lake stage occurred about 185,000‚Äì128,000 years ago during the Tahoe glacial stage and formed the Blackwelder shorelines. This lake was the largest known Lake Manly; theories that the lake merged with Lake Mojave farther south or even overflowed into the Colorado River close to Ludlow and across several other basins are, however, questionable. After the drying of this lake a later lake stage occurred 35,000‚Äì10,000 years ago during the Tioga/Wisconsin glaciation; this lake was smaller than the Blackwelder lake. During the Holocene, the lake disappeared; today only ephemeral lakes occur in Death Valley during strong floods. This lake is one among many major lakes that formed in the Great Basin, the best researched of which are Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville. Decreasing temperatures and thus decreased evaporation rates as well as increased precipitation rates during the ice ages were responsible for the formation of these lake systems. Lake Manly collected the overflow from a number of lakes including Lake Tecopa, Mono Lake, Owens Lake, Searles Lake, Lake Panamint, Lake Mojave, Lake Dumont and Lake Manix. Not all of them existed or drained into Lake Manly simultaneously.  Discovery and naming  The existence of large ancient lakes in the Great Basin of the United States was already proposed by the end of the 19th century, when the existence of Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville was first described. The possibility of a former lake in Death Valley was also considered during that time, though at first it was not universally accepted as a large lake. The first evidence for it was described in 1924 by geologist Levi F. Noble. Earlier in 1890 another geologist, Grove Karl Gilbert, already assumed a lake existed in Death Valley, although his lake was considerably larger than actual Lake Manly. Evidence for the lake's existence includes wavecut terraces observed by geologists in 1925, pebbles and tufa, layers of clay and salt on its former lake bed, and calcium carbonate deposits that were probably formed by algae in the lake. These clues are dispersed across Death Valley, especially within the more researched areas of Beatty Junction and Desolation Canyon. While the deposits were once attributed to a single lake stand, later evidence was found of various lake cycles going back to the Pliocene. The history of Lake Manly is not as well understood as that of Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville, the two largest pluvial lakes recorded in the Great Basin. More recently, renewed scientific interest has stemmed from the fact that Lake Manly formerly drained the area of Yucca Mountain, a proposed nuclear waste repository. The lake was named in honor of William Lewis Manly, who rescued white immigrants from Death Valley in 1849. The name \\"Lake Rogers\\" for a potential northern lake in Death Valley was derived from a compatriot of Manly, John Rogers. The name \\"Lake Manly\\" was coined in 1932, and is sometimes spelled as \\"Manley\\", which is a misspelling. Other names for the lakes in Death Valley are \\"Death Valley Pleistocene lakes\\" and \\"Death Valley Lake\\", a name first used in a publication of 1902. The name is used for the lakes that occupied Death Valley in the past, but occasionally the name \\"Lake Manly\\" is used only for the most recent, the middle Pleistocene lake stage or general late Pleistocene lake stages.  Geography  The drainage system of Lake Manly; present-day roads are shown for reference. Lake Manly formed in Death Valley, a tectonic depression framed by the Cottonwood Mountains and Panamint Range to the west, Owlshead Mountains to the south and Black Mountains, Funeral Mountains and Grapevine Mountains to the east. Death Valley is about long and wide and consists of three basins: Badwater Basin which reaches a depth of beneath sea level, Cottonball Basin and Middle Basin. The Badwater Basin is the deepest point in North America. Death Valley began forming about 14 million years ago, and by the Pliocene it was well developed. The valley remains deep due to vertical faulting, which occurs faster there than anywhere else in the US. Various types of rocks form the surface areas of Death Valley, some going back as far as the Precambrian. The Death Valley is tectonically active, with faults including the Black Mountains fault, Furnace Creek Fault, Grandview Fault, Northern Death Valley Fault, Southern Death Valley fault and Towne Pass Fault. Thus, shorelines from the same lake stands are often not at the same elevation in various parts of the basin. Faulting has caused a progressive drop in elevation of the floor of Death Valley, keeping pace with sedimentation, though the exact rates are not known. This deformation causes the southwestern shores of Lake Manly to sag with respect to the northeastern ones, and together with sedimentation renders estimating the depth of Lake Manly unreliable. This is compounded by the fact that many lake deposits are located close to the active faults of the Death Valley fault zone. Over the last 60,000‚Äì70,000 years, the Northern Death Valley fault zone has slipped by about . Lack of earthquakes and dates makes it difficult to estimate the activity of these faults, though an earthquake occurred in 1908, and Death Valley is actively subsiding. Volcanism has also affected Death Valley, including Ubehebe Crater in the valley and the distant Mono-Inyo Craters, all within the last 2,000 years. = The lake = Lake Manly was a long, narrow lake with a southern sub-basin named \\"Confidence Flats\\". It was about deep at highstand, and about above sea level. The lake reached a width of and length of . The shores of the lake were long. The most prominent shoreline at about elevation is known as \\"Blackwelder shoreline\\"; even higher shorelines have been identified at Shoreline Butte. At this stand, the lake had a surface area of about using present-day topography; at that point the volume would have been about . The absolute highest surface area Lake Manly could have had (at overflow height) was or . Some landforms indicative of lacustrine deposition have been found at altitudes of (the overflow height) above sea level around Death Valley but they could also be the consequences of non-lacustrine processes. Southern California and southern Nevada contain deserts with valleys similar to Death Valley that are also not formed by rivers. Many of them held water in the past; some lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Mono Lake, Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake still exist. These ancient lakes were ultimately generated by Basin and Range province tectonic phenomena which caused runoff to collect in closed basins. Various weather changes associated with the last glacial maximum favored their infilling, including southward shifts of storm tracks accompanying analogous shifts of the jet stream, which were probably forced by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Currently a salt pan fills Death Valley, with an average surface altitude of . One island existed close to Beatty Junction, with two more at Shoreline Butte in the southernmost point of the lake; the northern foot of the Avawatz Mountains may have formed a peninsula on the southern shore. No river deltas or other embankments have been found at Lake Manly's shorelines; their formation was likely hampered by unstable water levels. Only vague remnants of a delta are found where the Amargosa River probably entered Lake Manly, and the alluvial fan of Warm Springs Canyon is cut by shorelines of Lake Manly. Chevrons and pisolites have been found in lake sediments. A number of alluvial fans decorate the former shores of Lake Manly. = Shorelines = Shoreline Butte, close with shorelines visible Landforms associated with Lake Manly have been identified at a number of points in Death Valley. At Beatty Junction, winds on the lake formed several spits and barrier bars. Shorelines at Desolation Canyon also included spits and a tombolo. Just south of Desolation Canyon, the so-called Manly Terraces are a group of and terraces. At least 12 different terraces have been found at Shoreline Butte. A number of bars and spits formed on the shores of Lake Manly and are preserved to this day. Some rocks in shoreline deposits left by the lake display evidence of honeycomb weathering. The southern shore of Lake Manly was formed by alluvial fans that had coalesced at the foot of the Avawatz Mountains; these fans are still growing and displacing the Amargosa River eastwards. Some sand and gravel deposits at Salt Spring Hills with elevations of about may have been formed by either Lake Manly or another paleolake south of Death Valley, Lake Dumont. The shores of Lake Manly were influenced by wave action. These waves probably came predominantly from the north-northwest, causing near shore material to be transported to the south. This also explains why most of the shore features are found on the eastern shores of the lake as these were the most exposed to wave action. It is not always clear whether a strandline is actually a strand line or a surface expression of fault activity; some supposed lower strandlines at Mormon Point were later reinterpreted as fault scarps.  Hydrology  Lacustrine system of the Mojave Desert The size of pluvial lakes, such as Lake Manly, is governed by the balance between inflow by precipitation or rivers or streams and evaporation, if one assumes that seepage and overflow are not important. This can make the surface of such lakes a useful gauge for paleoclimatic conditions. The principal water supplies to Lake Manly were the Amargosa River, the Mojave River and the Owens River, which yielded a large integrated drainage system over the southwestern Great Basin. The total surface area of Lake Manly's catchment was about . Contrary to what early researchers first speculated it is however likely, that the three rivers never reached Lake Manly simultaneously. The Owens River-Lake Manly system = Inflow = The principal river flowing into Lake Manly was the Amargosa River. It originally ended in Lake Tecopa; only more recently than 600,000 years ago did it arrive at Death Valley, possibly as recently as 140,000 to 18,000 years ago. Even earlier, the Amargosa River may have flowed towards the Colorado River. The Mojave River may have reached the Amargosa and thus drained into Lake Manly, but probably only during wet periods, and only since the most recent Pleistocene; the breaching of the intermediary lakes Lake Manix, Lake Mojave, and Lake Dumont occurred later than 18,000 years before present, and earlier overflow is uncertain. Before the time where it flowed into these lakes, the Mojave River drained westward. Overflow from Lake Mojave may have continued until 8,000 years ago. The Mojave River reached the Amargosa through Silurian Valley and Salt Creek; on its way it crossed Dry Lake, Silurian Lake and another pond at the foot of the Salt Spring Hills. Currently, the integration of the Mojave River into Death Valley is nearly complete; once the basin of Lake Mojave has been filled completely with sediment to the altitude of its own spillway, even under current conditions its waters will reach Death Valley. At least during the Tahoe glaciation, the Owens River drained into Lake Manly after filling Owens Lake, China Lake, Searles Lake and the Panamint Valley. This river system formed 3.2 million years ago when lava flows blocked a channel that had previously drained the Owens River across the Sierra Nevada. Sediment data indicate that 900,000‚Äì800,000 and 700,000‚Äì600,000 years ago waters from Panamint Valley reached Lake Manly, as chloride was being removed from the valley at that time. Increased precipitation and the formation of glaciers on the eastern Sierra Nevada increased the amount of water in the Owens River, and decreased temperatures reduced evaporation at each of these lakes, thus allowing water to get from lake to lake. When Panamint Lake reached a water depth of , it spilled over Wingate Pass into Lake Manly. Little evidence of such spillover remains, such as delta-like deposits at Anvil Spring Canyon, the distribution of fish fossils in the various waterbodies, ostracod data and the presence of northupite; strontium isotope data suggest that the Owens River system was a minor contributor to Lake Manly. Sediments in Panamint Valley suggest that the last time that Panamint Valley overflowed into Death Valley was 95,000‚Äì55,000 years ago although the dates display a lot of scatter; during the Tioga glaciation, the Owens River stopped in Lake Searles, considering that lower shorelines at Lake Searles do not appear to correspond to any shoreline in Panamint Valley and Death Valley, and no evidence has been found at Wingate Pass for overflow after 30,000 years ago. Runoff from the region that the Owens River originates from may have contributed to Lake Manly during the Pliocene, most likely through different paths however. Whether Owens River water reached Lake Manly between 1.2 and 0.6‚Äì0.51 million years ago is unclear. These rivers in turn received inflow from other paleolakes, such as Lake Pahrump which drained into the Amargosa River and shares fish with the latter, Lake Dumont/Lake Manix/Lake Mojave which were passed through by the Mojave River, and after 1.6 million years ago Lake Russell (present day Mono Lake) through the Owens River. This later connection is biologically significant as Mono Lake was variously connected with the San Joaquin River and Lake Lahontan; thus it could have been a pathway for life to propagate between these water systems, a notion supported by fish fossil data such as the minnows and suckerfish of the Death Valley system which appear to originate in Lake Lahontan. Lake Lahontan might have drained into Lake Manly; one potential pathway would be from the Walker Lake basin over Soda Springs Valley, Fish Lake Valley and Eureka Valley where it may have been joined by overflow from Deep Springs Valley. All these valleys are at successively lower elevations. Connections to the Colorado River also existed: There is evidence that the Amargosa River captured a tributary of the latter in the Indian Springs Valley area; such an event may have transferred fish along with the about large catchment from the Colorado River to the Lake Manly system. Before integrating with Lake Manly, the Mojave River may have exited Lake Manix towards Ludlow, California and from then into the Colorado, before diverting to Lake Mojave and then into Lake Manly. Overall, this formed a large system of interconnected lakes, the largest of the Great Basin and also the basin's largest catchment. In total, runoff at the time of Lake Manly was at least 3.5 times larger than today. A southward shift of the polar front may have aided the formation of Lake Manly. Further water reached the lake from streams in the Amargosa Mountains and the Panamint Mountains, where water originates from snowmelt. Presently, the main inflows are from Salt Creek from the north and the Amargosa River, with springs around the basin contributing a large proportion of the present day water budget in the valley. Other such streams include Furnace Creek, Hanaupah Canyon, Point Canyon, Six Springs Canyon and Willow Springs Canyon. Springs also contributed water to Lake Manly, especially during the early lake stage. These springs would have helped stabilize the water levels. In turn, Lake Manly would have affected the local water table. The brines and evaporites indicate that spring water contributed to the hydrology of Lake Manly. Present day groundwater originates primarily from Spring Mountain. = Outlet = According to early researchers, Lake Manly had no outlet and its water level would have been governed exclusively by the balance of inflow and evaporation. Biological evidence, however, such as fossil pupfish, indicates that connections to the Colorado River existed, then ceased about 3-2 million years ago. More generally, evidence for Miocene drainage of Death Valley to the Pacific Ocean exists. A major research issue remains as to whether Lake Manly ever drained into the Colorado River. Such a drainage may have occurred through Broadwell Lake across the high pass close to Ludlow, and entered the Colorado close to present-day Parker, Arizona, after passing through Bristol Lake, Cadiz Lake and Lake Danby. Potentially such an overflow, if it existed, would have reached rates of . Overall though scientific consensus tends to view any connection between Lake Manly and the Colorado more recent than 3 million years ago as unlikely. There is no evidence that Lake Manly reached such an elevation, though shorelines may have been obscured by later alluvial fans. A prominent channel, deep and , over Ash Hill (the pass in question) may have been the overflow channel, but it could also be the product of local runoff. Further, there is no indication that Bristol Lake, the lake that water from an overflow would have entered into, was ever filled with freshwater in the last four million years; though foraminifera correlated with the Colorado River have been found, and some sedimentary and fish evolutionary data likewise support it. Salts left behind by Lake Manly, in Badwater Basin = Water composition = As an endorheic lake, Lake Manly was naturally a saltwater lake. The waters would have had less saline at highstand than during growth and regression stages. Further, given that most water inflow occurred from the south, waters probably were less saline there. During the dry period before the last lake stage, salt accumulated at a rate of . Salinity did not exceed 10,000 ppm and sometimes did not even reach 3,000 ppm, considering data taken from ostracods. The composition of lake deposits suggests that calcium-rich springs associated with a crustal magma chamber in the southern Death Valley contributed sizable quantities of water to the lake; this magma chamber is also correlated to a 700,000 years old cinder cone in southern Death Valley. 140,000 and 135,000 years before present, Panamint Valley drained relatively alkaline waters into Lake Manly. This composition is also supported by the presence of alkali-liking ostracods in lake deposits, and by patterns of erosion on lake deposits.  Climate  The mean annual temperature of Death Valley is about , due in part to its relatively low elevation; July temperatures exceed on average. Based on plant data, summer temperatures at Lake Manly during the Pleistocene were about 6‚Äì8 ¬∞C (11‚Äì14 ¬∞F) lower than present day; Yucca whipplei was found at altitudes too cold for its development, suggesting that middle altitudes winters were milder 12,000‚Äì10,000 years ago. Winter water temperatures may have dropped below however, occasionally falling below with a maxima of during the latest lake stage. The \\"Blackwelder\\" stage had higher maximum temperatures. Maximum temperatures were depressed by 4‚Äì15 ¬∞C (7‚Äì27 ¬∞F) during summers in the last highstand; Blackwelder highstand temperatures reached , however. Death Valley has a dry climate, owing to the rain shadow formed by the Panamint Range and the Sierra Nevada, which is enhanced by the relative depth of the valley. Thus less than precipitation fall every year, and large year-to-year variations are observed. Much of this rainfall is transported by winter storms, although summer thunderstorms and tropical storms also contribute. The depression of the forest line in Death Valley suggests that during the Pleistocene, rainfall was three or four times what it is today. Based on hydrological modelling, a temperature drop of about and 2.5 times today's precipitation would be needed to recreate the last highstand of Lake Manly. Lake Manly was probably windier than present-day Death Valley, as present day winds would not be strong enough to push some of the rocks that were moved along Lake Manly's shores; wind speeds of over would be needed. Later research reduced this requirement to about , which is consistent with estimated present day wind speeds in Death Valley. The topography of the valley would have generated northerly winds over Lake Manly, but strong southwesterly winds also contributed to the formation of beach deposits. Wave heights have been estimated at about with heights of about needed to transport beach material, enough to form backwash and swash. Wave activity was most pronounced in the southern and northern parts of Lake Manly.  Biology  Some inferences on the biota of Lake Manly can be made on the basis of analogous lakes such as Mono Lake and Great Salt Lake and on the streams that drain into Death Valley. Shared species are considered evidence not only for the integration of regional river systems, but also for connections with more remote water systems such as the Colorado River. Such a connection to the Colorado River may have occurred through the White River and Las Vegas Valley, through the Amargosa River or an earlier course of the Mojave River into Bristol Lake. Alternatively, migratory birds might have dispersed animals between the watersheds. Species dwelling in groundwater also existed in the lake. Some tufa deposits were formed by blue-green algae, including charophytes and a foraminiferan, Elphidium. Ostracod species which existed in Lake Manly include Candona caudata, Candona rawsoni, Cyprideis beaconensis, Limnocythere ceriotuberosa, Limnocythere sappaensis and Limnocythere staplini. Stromatolites were active in ponds behind the beaches of Lake Manly. Species that inhabited the lake probably included the brine fly larvae, brine shrimp and molluscs like Anodonta and Carinifex. Present day endemic aquatic fauna includes amphipods, hemipterans and springtails. The integrated river system may have aided the spread of the spider Saltonia incerta. Nineteen different species of Tyronia springsnails occur within the Lake Manly system, more specifically in the Owens River and Amargosa River valleys. An early connection between the Amargosa River and the Colorado River may have propagated these animals between the two river systems. Much research has been done on Death Valley fish, of which about 24 species have been described. Minnows like Agosia and Siphateles as well as the desert pupfish inhabit streams and probably lived in Lake Manly as well. The Lake Manly drainage system facilitated the spread of species of the genera Cyprinodon and Empetrichthys in the region, and of pupfish more generally. After 10,000 years before present this drainage system disappeared and distinct pupfish species evolved. Pupfish may have entered Death Valley through the Owens River, or through an earlier Pliocene river system, probably forming an unified breeding population. The speciation of Cyprinodon nevadensis and Cyprinodon salinus may have occurred in just a few thousand years after the drying of Lake Manly. It is likely that the propagation of pupfish across the whole system took longer than this, as Lake Manly was never simultaneously connected to all three of its source drainages and pupfish would have had to enter the Death Valley system from the Gulf of Mexico over large distances. Cyprinodon has been present in Death Valley since the late Miocene-early Pliocene. Now-extinct Fundulus species existed during the Miocene in Death Valley. The shores of the lake supported bird populations. Vegetation including sagebrush probably covered mountain slopes, with higher slopes containing juniper, pine, and Utah juniper forests. Forests during the Pleistocene extended down from altitude; presently only land above is forested. At even lower altitudes shadscale and yucca fossils have been found. The occurrence of lizards of the genus Uma is associated with paleoriver-paleolake systems, which tend to favor their propagation. One clade of Uma scoparia is associated with the Lake Manly system. The California vole was likewise propagated between the Mojave River and Amargosa River systems by the Lake Manly drainage. Freshwater lakes would also be suitable habitats for the establishment of humans. Various potentially man-made tools were found on Manly Terrace. These include scrapers, gravers and lesser numbers of drills and blades. This human activity probably occurred at the time of the last highstand of Lake Manly, during the Wisconsin glaciation. The human origin of these artifacts has been contested however, because they appear to resemble natural rocks from the area.  Chronology  Lake Manly existed during the late Pleistocene, and was at first considered to be an early Wisconsin glaciation (Tahoe stage) phenomenon. Originally, it was believed that Lake Manly did not exist during the Tioga glaciation, and it was assumed that Lake Manly existed in only one stage. Later evidence, such as drilling core data, indicates two distinct lake stages, one 185,000‚Äì128,000 years ago and another 35,000‚Äì10,000 years ago. This corresponds to oxygen isotope stage 6 and 2 respectively. Between 120,000 and 60,000 years ago there was no lake in Death Valley, and separate saline lakes existed between 60,000 and 35,000 years ago. Lake levels in Lake Manly appear to track the size of the Laurentide Ice Sheet but only very roughly so. Further, last glacial maximum highstands of Lake Manly appear to precede highstands of Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville, probably due to a northward shift of the jet stream. = Earliest highstands = According to sedimentation patterns, a southeastward flowing river occupied northern Death Valley during the late Miocene, and was gone by 3.35 million years ago. This river system started in the Cottonwood Mountains ‚Äì possibly as far as Last Chance Range and Owens Valley ‚Äì and passed through northern Death Valley into the Amargosa Valley, possibly into the Colorado River. A Pliocene stage is documented in southern Death Valley, and a lake in the Furnace Creek basin of northern Death Valley reached a highstand 3.35 million years ago; a number of tephra layers provide controls on the ages of this lake. Thus, a very early lake existed in northern Death Valley between 3.5 and 1.7 million years ago, or between 3.4 and <3 million years ago, probably coinciding with the beginning development of a glacial climate in North America at that time. Such a lake was connected with the Owens Valley because Coso volcanic field tuffs have been found in Death Valley. The basins occupied by early lakes were probably not the same as those of Lake Manly; tectonic deformation has lifted the Nova basin above the current floor of Death Valley. This lake was most likely of limited extent. The 1.7‚Äì1.9-million-year-old Glass Mountain tuffs formed deposits in such early lakes. In the early and middle Pleistocene, the Amargosa River and Mojave River ended in terminal lakes before reaching Death Valley, and it is not clear that the Owens River could overflow from Panamint Valley into Death Valley. Tephra interbedded with lake deposits indicates that a pre-Lake Manly existed between 1.2‚Äì0.8 million and 665,000 years before present. Simultaneous highstands in other Great Basin lakes such as Lake Bonneville may be correlated with this lake stage, which occurred during marine isotope stage 16. It is not clear whether this was one lake or several disconnected lakes. Other old lake stands may have occurred 510,000 years ago and 216,000‚Äì194,000 years before present; shorelines from the latter stand are presently at altitudes of . The existence of Lake Manly 1,000,000‚Äì600,000 years ago is possible but questionable; yet older lake formations have been variously dated between 3.7 and 0.77 million years ago. These formations are known as \\"Lake Manly phase 1\\" or \\"Lake Zabriskie\\". = Blackwelder highstand = The highest shoreline at elevations of has been named Blackwelder stand, after a researcher who first examined the fossil shorelines. It appears to belong to the first (Illinoian) stage of the lake, but was originally thought to belong to the second (Wisconsinian) stage, during oxygen isotope stage 6. Additional shorelines associated with this highstand are found at elevations of . Uranium-thorium dating has linked this shoreline to the older highstand, about 186,000‚Äì120,000 years before present; an alternative proposal linking the Blackwelder stand with a wet period in Lake Searles 1.3‚Äì1 million years ago conflicts with other dates. The uranium-thorium dates and others of the Blackwelder stand are not beyond all doubts, however. A brief dry period may have occurred 148,000 years ago, possibly caused by a temporary damming of the Amargosa River. Ostracod data indicates two separate highstands 154,500‚Äì149,000 and 122,000‚Äì120,000 years ago. Depending on the rate of tectonic sinking, the lake at the early stage was and up to deep. The Sperry terrace in Amargosa Canyon appears to be of the same general age as the Blackwelder highstand. During this time the Amargosa River and Owens River reached Lake Manly. Ostracod fossils from this lake stage suggest that the lake's conditions varied during this timespan. This shoreline is found at Mormon Point, Shoreline Butte and elsewhere in the northern Death Valley but not in the south; one theory states that shorelines at elevations of (Salt Spring and Saddle Springs) and (Mesquite Spring at Soda Lake) are Blackwelder shorelines that were offset by tectonic deformation at a geologically reasonable rate of . Such would imply that Soda Lake and Silver Lake during the Blackwelder stand were connected with Lake Manly; this theory is known as \\"mega Lake Manly\\". Such an expansion would have occurred whenever the lake levels rose above above sea level and thus could flow south across Salt Spring Hills; the enlargement of the lake surface that resulted would have increased evaporation and stabilized lake levels. There is no clear cut evidence that these shorelines are of the same age as the Blackwelder shoreline, although they are of similar appearance. The spread of pupfish between the Mojave River and Death Valley drainages would also be more likely with such a lake configuration. There is no indication that Soda Lake playa had a lake during oxygen isotope stage 6, although water currents in a previous lake may have transported sands that are usually only found in ephemeral lakes through a deeper lake. Further, based on dating, shorelines at Salt Spring appear to belong to the later lake stage, and the tectonic deformation required to link the two southern shorelines to the Blackwelder has been deemed implausible, and has not been supported by analysis of the shorelines themselves. A final explanation assumes that during that stage, Lake Manly did not extend into southern Death Valley. The Blackwelder highstand was probably not stabilized by overflow seeing as the only spillway close to Ludlow is about high above sea level ‚Äì considerably higher than the Blackwelder highstand could plausibly be ‚Äì and the highest shorelines at Shoreline Butte and Lake Mojave are considerably lower. Additionally, the development of stable shorelines does not by default require an overflow, as demonstrated by the Dead Sea and its precursor Lake Lisan. = Later lake stages = By 130,000‚Äì120,000 years ago, Lake Manly had retreated from the Blackwelder highstand. A further lake stage may have occurred during oxygen isotope stage 4, but evidence is equivocal. Ostracod fossils dated between 129,000 and 123,000 years ago indicate that Death Valley was wetter than today and supported several hydrological environments. Between 54,000 and 50,000 years ago various shallow phases of Lake Manly occurred. The later lake stage which occurred during the Wisconsin glaciation/Weichselian glaciation was not as large as the Blackwelder lake stage; at first it was suggested that only small lakes occupied Death Valley during that time. The later lake was shallower, with tufas dated at 25,000 and 18,000 years before present having formed at elevations of . That lake was probably shallow, with estimated depths of . Later research indicated that late Lake Manly was even shallower, probably because regional climate conditions favorable to its growth were rarer during the later lake stage than at Blackwelder times, and might have even been split into two separate waterbodies. Further, it may have been dominated more by groundwater discharge. In general, the chronology of this recent lake stage is not very clear. The last glacial maximum lake had a surface area of about . This lake stage had highstands approximately 26,000, 18,000 and 12,000 years before present, which have been named \\"DVLP-1\\" (\\"Death Valley Late Pleistocene lake high-stand\\"), \\"DVLP-2\\" and \\"DVLP-3\\" respectively. Some radiocarbon dates have been obtained on this lake, including 12,980 ¬± 700 and 11,900 ¬± 200. The recession commenced before 12,970 ¬± 185 years ago. = Present day = A reformed lake in 2005 By 12,000 years before present, Lake Manly had shrunk to the Badwater basin and was probably only deep. This drying event separated various Cyprinodon populations from each other, triggering the evolution of individual species with restricted distribution. Based on the state of preservation of shoreline deposits (e.g., at Hanaupah Fan), the retreat of the lake was probably much faster than its growth. The lake had vanished by 10,000 years ago, although some evidence for a Holocene lake has been found. A minor lacustrine period occurred between 5,000 and 2,000 years ago; this lake was larger than Lake Mead and probably existed for less than 100 years. Its shorelines have been found at elevations of . Since then, only a pond in Badwater basin remains, and the valley is hot and dry. The rest of the valley floor is filled with mudflats and salt pans. Salt Creek and some springs are the only freshwater present. Floods of the Mojave River are lost before reaching Death Valley. Current evaporation rates and climate conditions do not allow the existence of perennial lakes in Death Valley. The bulk of present- day water in Death Valley is supplied by groundwater discharge. The Amargosa River is mostly underground, but occasionally it can flood and reach Death Valley. Parts of Death Valley are sometimes flooded during wet weather, causing parts of Lake Manly to reform. Legend has it that such happens only every hundred years. Severe flooding in March 2005 resulted in parts of Death Valley becoming submerged. This precipitation event broke records dating back to 1911 and was followed by a major desert bloom. Such lake refillings are usually associated with El Ni√±o events.

The intent of the catalog was to \\"present Indian art in an aesthetic context, as art, and to help the public see it in a new way.\\" First Lady of the United States, Eleanore Roosevelt, wrote the introduction to the catalogue: \\"At this time, when America is reviewing its cultural resources, this book and the exhibit on which it is based open up to us age-old sources of ideas and forms that have never been fully appreciated. In appraising the Indian's past and present achievements, we realize not only that his heritage constitutes part of the artistic and spiritual wealth of this country, but also that the Indian people of today have a contribution to make towards the America of the future.\\" \\"In dealing with Indian art of the United States, we find that its sources reach far beyond our borders, both to the north and to the south. Hemispheric inter-change of ideas is as old as man on this continent. Long before Columbus, tribes now settled in Arizona brought traditions to this country that were formed in Alaska and Canada; Indian traders from the foot of the Rocky Mountains exchanged goods and ideas with the great civilizations two thousand miles south of the Rio Grande. Related thoughts and forms that are truly of America are found from the Andes to the Mississippi Valley.\\" \\"We acknowledge here a cultural debt not only to the Indians of the United States but to the Indians of both Americas.\\" Lenders to the Exhibition *Mr. William Henry Claflin, Jr., Belmont, Mass. *Mr. Miguel Covarrubias *Mrs. William Denman, San Francisco, Calif. *Mr. Rene d'Harnoncourt, Washington, DC *Mrs. Charles Dietrich, Santa Fe, New Mexico *Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth B.

This townhouse is considered a magnificent example of the introduction of the Renaissance in Toulouse and a symbol of the city's affluence.Explanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche. History Portrait of Jean de Bernuy The facade of H√¥tel de Bernuy was built between 1503 to 1504, so was the gothic brick courtyard and its tower. The Renaissance stone courtyard was constructed from 1530 to 1536. The owner was a rich woad merchant, Jean de Bernuy, a Spanish Jew who had fled the inquisition and was credit-worthy enough to be the main guarantor of the ransomed King Francis I of France after his capture at the Battle of Pavia by Charles V of Spain. It is an original example of Renaissance palaces architecture of Toulouse, with a stone decoration of the cour d'honneur (courtyard) influenced by Spanish Plateresque. The use of brick in the gothic courtyard is typical of Toulouse, while the use of stone in the Renaissance courtyard is rare and indicates the wealth of the owner. The gothic courtyard and its staircase tower The attention of Bernuy first focused on the back of his plot where his shops stood, and on a small gothic courtyard where he had built in 1504 a great staircase tower. Bernuy wanted his tower to be as high as his father-in-law's, the prosecutor Arnaud du Faur. Raising a tower towards the heavens was prestigious; decorating it with stone and bestowing upon it the marks of a mediaeval feudal lord, even more so. The windows of the tower have been 'bent', that indicates the skill of the stonemason Merigo Cayla.

Crowned with an ogee arch decorated with cabbage leaf and bordered with pinnacles, the gate conforms to the fashion of the period: flamboyant gothic. When Bernuy started to undertake his grand Renaissance courtyard, he instructed the architect Louis Privat to move this gate to rue Gambetta and to bring it up. Privat duly inserted into the brick wall several sculpted ornaments typical of the Renaissance: putti bearing the owner's motto and arms, and portraits medallions. The coexistance of the two styles (gothic and Renaissance) was frequent at that time. It had the advantage of combining prestigious ornaments, both traditional and innovative.

From 1530 to 1536 he built a new courtyard on rue Gambetta in which he gave free rein to the vocabulary of the Renaissance. The portrait medallions of the owners, shown holding philacteries (scrolls), seem to welcome the visitors. Tall and powerful candelabra columns punctuating the arcades confer a great sense of monumentality to the courtyard. The upper gallery, supported by the great surbased arch, has windows that feature Corinthian columns, a first in Toulouse. Their design came from a treatise on architecture. The abundant use of stone, unheard of at the time in Toulouse, demonstrated the wealth of the owner. Considering its ambitious design and extravagant dimensions, the great arch must be the most extraordinary feature of this courtyard. Its unique character also comes from the bespoke treatment of each of the coffers. Their partitions, along with the hanging roses between them, ignore the curve of the arch and are instead perfectly vertical, an effect that must have made the stonemason's work considerably more difficult.

Army career After leaving Harrow, Dickins was commissioned into the British Army in 1842, initially as an ensign in the 98th Regiment of Foot. He transferred to the Royal Scots Fusiliers almost immediately and served until 1848 in the East Indies, being promoted to lieutenant in 1846. On returning to Britain in 1848 he served in Scotland, the north of England and in Ireland, transferring to the 46th Foot as a captain. He resigned his commission in 1854 and the following year joined a contingent of British ex-servicemen to fight in the Crimean War with the rank of major. He left the unit shortly before it was disbanded in 1858. Cricket Although he did not play for the school First XI, Dickins was a keen club cricketer. He played some of his cricket whilst serving in Scotland, the north of England and Ireland. He made his first-class debut for the Gentlemen of Kent during 1848 at Canterbury, shortly after returning from service in the East Indies.George Dickins, CricketArchive. Retrieved 17 June 2020.

The car competed in various sportscar racing events during the 1969 and 1970 seasons. Background Guy Ligier was a French former athlete and successful businessman who began to pursue a career as a professional racing driver at 34 years of age. Ligier enjoyed many successes when partnered with fellow countryman Jo Schlesser driving Ford GT40s. The two men became friends and eventually went into business together, launching their own team, Ecurie InterSport. Ongoing mechanical problems with the various cars they drove moved Schlesser to ask Ligier \\"What if we did our own cars?\\" The question would not be answered before Schlesser's untimely death in practice at what was to have been his Formula 1 debut at the French Grand Prix in 1968. Following Schlesser's sudden demise, Ligier retired from racing to pursue the production of his own sports-racing cars. Ligier founded Automobiles Ligier in 1968, and in 1969 hired engineer/designer Michel T√™tu, who had previously worked for Renault and for Charles Deutsch, to design the cars. The JS1 was the first product of the new company, and was named in honour of Jo Schlesser. Technical details The JS1 was officially unveiled in September 1969 at the Salon de l'Auto in Paris. The car was a two-door fixed-head mid-engined coup√©. The body was designed by Pietro Frua and executed in fibreglass, but Ligier had considerable input into the character of his first car. His requirements that the car be light and compact but with good forward visibility from the cabin resulted in the JS1 having a large cockpit and big sloping windshield. T√™tu's chassis was similar in principle to the contemporary Lotus Europa and Alpine A110, being a central backbone with additional structures front and rear to accommodate suspension and engine. Steel had been considered for use in the chassis but in the end T√™tu employed a unique construction method using a polyurethane Klegecell core sandwiched between aluminum panels. The suspension used wishbones with coilover-damper units on all corners. The brakes were disks on all four wheels. Steering was by rack-and-pinion. The first engine used in the car was a 1598cc Cosworth FVA producing 220 bhp. Power went to the wheels through a 5-speed Hewland transaxle. Racing Guy Ligier drove the JS1 in its 1969 debut race at the Tour de France, but retired due to a failed engine mount. The next year the FVA motor was replaced by a 1790cc Cosworth FVC engine that developed approximately 240 hp. 1970 brought wins at Albi and Montlh√©ry. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans Ligier's driving partner was Jean-Claude Andruet. The car ran in the Prototype class. The pair qualified in 13th place and were among the first ten in the overall ranking when they were forced to retire after eight hours with a distributor problem. For the Tour Auto Ligier entered a two-car team with both cars having different versions of the Ford Cologne V6. One car received a 2637cc 2.6 RS engine from the Ford Capri RS2600, while the second car received a 2397cc V6 with Weslake alloy cylinder heads. Extensive changes were made to the chassis to fit the new engines, and the Hewland transaxle used with the Cosworth engines also gave way to a new 5-speed unit from the Citro√´n SM. Both cars retired. Only three JS1s were ever built. Work began on its successor, the JS2, as early as 1970. The only known surviving JS1, chassis 002, has been fully restored and has appeared at various historical racing events since 2004.

In which case some species are particularly good at colonizing and others have well-established survival abilities. The concept of the competition-colonization trade-off was originally proposed by Levins and Culver, the model indicated that two species could coexist if one had impeccable competition skill and the other was excellent at colonizing. The model indicates that there is typically a trade- off, in which a species is typically better at either competing or colonizing. A later model, labelled The Lottery Model was also proposed, in which interspecific competition is accounted for within the population. Mathematical Models: Levins and Culver Model: : frac{text{d} p_1}{text{d} t} = c_1 p_1 (1 - p_1) - m_1 p_1 : frac{text{d} p_2}{text{d} t} = c_2 p_2 (1 - p_1 - p_2) - m_2 p_2 - c_1 p_1 p_2 Where: p_i = fraction of patches that are occupied by species i ; c_i = colonization rate of species i ; m_i = mortality rate of species i (independent of patch density). Species 1 = competitor, can colonize in area that is uninhabited or inhabited by species 2 (1 - p_1) . Species 2 = colonizer, can only colonize in uninhabited areas (1 - p_1 - p_2) . Species 2 is subject to displacement by its competitor (- c_1 p_1 p_2) . If species 2 has a higher colonization rate it can coexist with species 1: c_2 > frac{c_1(c_1+m_2-m_1)}{m_1} . This model is described as the displacement competition model, it has been observed in marine mollusks and fungi. This model makes two large assumptions: 1. \\"a propagule of a superior competitor takes over a patch from an adult of the inferior competitor\\". 2. The adult must be displaced fast enough to ensure that it does not reproduce while it is being displaced. Lottery Model: : frac{text{d} p_1}{text{d} t} = c_1 frac{f}{f + p_2} p_1 (h - p_1 - p_2) m_1 p_1 : frac{text{d} p_2}{text{d} t} = c_2 frac{g}{g + p_1} p_2 (h - p_1 - p_2) m_2 p_2 Colonization rate is now described by interspecific competition. frac{f}{f + p_2} and frac{g}{g + p_1} . Both f and g > 0. An increase in p1 is related to a decrease in the colonization rate of species 2. g < f implies a competitive advantage of species 1 and c2 > c1 implies a colonization advantage for species 2. In Plants: The competition-colonization trade-off theory has primarily been used to examine and describe the dispersal-linked traits of a plant's seeds. Seed size is a primary feature that relates to a species ability to colonize or compete within a given population, the effect of seed size was displayed in dicotyledonous annual plants. Turnbull and colleagues indicated that the competition/colonization trade-off has a stabilizing effect on the population of plants. In Algae: For example, in a classic study on an intertidal zone in Southern California, it was shown that when a boulder was overturned, it would quickly be colonized by green algae and barnacles (which were better colonizers). However, if left undisturbed, the boulders would eventually be overtaken by red algae (which was the stronger competitor in the long term).

The H√¥tel du Vieux Raisin in Toulouse, France is a Renaissance h√¥tel particulier (palace) of the 16th century. This townhouse is surely one of the most beautiful private mansions of the time. It was built for Berenger Maynier, professor of law, lord of Canac and Gallice and capitoul in 1515‚Äì1516; The style chosen was that of this period, strongly influenced by Italian Renaissance architecture. History H√¥tel du Vieux Raisin is based on a fifteenth-century building, which stood on the huge plot of the neighbouring H√¥tel Dahus and was later partially demolished to make way for Rue Ozenne. Dating from this period are the embrasures and gargoyles in the upper part of the fa√ßade that looks over Rue Jos√© F√©lix.Explanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche. In 1515, lawyer B√©ringuier Maynier purchased the house and undertook building restoration. A new house was added to the original building, to separate the courtyard from the garden, and given a staircase tower on either side. The house was extended with two short wings. In the courtyard, on the side adjoining the garden and Rue Jos√© F√©lix, many richly decorated windows were installed. Busts medallions were placed between the openings on the great tower in the courtyard. From 1547 to 1577 the house was owned by magistrate Jean Burnet. The main courtyard took on an idealized form (square) with the extensions of the wings. The entrance was closed off with a portico inspired by the loggia of the H√¥tel d'Ass√©zat (Doric columns, mixture of brick and stone). The coffers continue to show Burnet's arms and those of his wife. Next, Pierre de Lancrau, a bishop who owned the property between 1580 and 1591, heightened the great staircase tower and installed in the main courtyard several windows featuring telamons. Street windows Due to the absence of nearby stone quarries, the predominant building material in Toulouse was brick, so adding a stone window to a house was an effective way of displaying success and social rank, such features attracting the eyes of passers-by. The various owners of the h√¥tel were consistent in the care they took over the decoration of the windows. On rue Ozenne, the windows commissioned by B√©ringuier Maynier feature magnificent pilasters, candelabra and rinceaux. On rue du Languedoc, a sculpted window commissioned by Jean Burnet between 1547 and 1555 took inspiration from an engraving by the architect Jacques Androuet du Cerceau. It retains the general composition of the engraving but simplifies the upper section and adds sculpted human and hybrid figures. This window had its admirers because in 1555 the parliementarian Pierre de Nos copied it for the castle on his estate. Courtyard ornaments In the courtyard, some of the telamon windows can be attributed to Nicolas Bachelier. Those of the ground floor belong to another hand and date from the late sixteenth century. On the first floor, the figures supporting the entablatures of the windows seem to be straining under the weight. On the ground floor, the hybrid figures with lion feet or on pilasters show exceptional diversity as well as great anatomical and psychological realism. Imprisoned in the stone, they bear their burden with dignity and solemnity. Other sculpted motifs abound in the frames and reference royal buildings, such as the Francis I Gallery at the Palace of Fontainebleau, and sometimes even draw inspiration from the famous works of Benvenuto Cellini and Michelangelo. The fireplace Focal point for pomp, a sumptuous fireplace displays a classical vocabulary, and thus demonstrates the humanist knowledge of B√©ringuier Maynier. At the center of the frieze, two kneeling putti present the owner's arms in a floral wreath (called 'triumphal garland'). Medallions framed with triumphal garlands or supported by hybrid beings, chubby cherubs playing with an imposing garland of fruits and vegetables on the pediment: the iconographic work constitutes a panegyric of fortune, abundance and fertility.

Marcel had an active participation in all demonstrations in favor of Dilma Rousseff's impeachment, including those in April, August, and December 2015. He followed closely the votes in the Brazilian House of Representatives and the Brazilian Senate. The assemblyman also made a fierce campaign against the political support given by his political party (Partido Progressista), at the national level, for Dilma Rousseff's government. Due to the state's fiscal crisis, Marcel decided that he could not morally accept the salary increase for the assemblymen, approved shortly before he took oath in 2014. The salary increase (R$3.827,93) is returned every month to the state treasury. This value is automatically deducted from his paycheck. In May 2015, the bill ‚ÄúEscola sem Partido‚Äù (literally, ‚Äúschool without political party‚Äù) is protocoled, which aims to end a perceived ideological indoctrination in schools. In August 2015, a bill to give better transparency of public spending on advertising by public agencies is protocoled. Systemically, Marcel positions himself and votes against the increase of taxes and of public expenses. Marcel also has great interest in foreign activities and events related to the promotion of democracy in universities, entities, think tanks, and political parties. He followed the Argentinian (22 November) and Venezuelan elections (6 December) in 2015 as an international observer and in 2016 he went on a mission to the Netherlands, in order to analyze the possibilities of using the unexplored river potential for transportation in cooperation with the Dutch government.
