They include Laiholh (Hakha-Chin) spoken around the Haka (Hakha/Halkha) capital of Chin State in Burma (Myanmar) and in the Lawngtlai district of Mizoram, India. In Bangladesh, a related language is spoken by the Bawm people. Likewise, Lai Mizo-Kuki-Chin includes Falam Lai (Laizo {Tlaisun-Hlawncheu}, Zahau {Tlauhmun-Khuangcheu} and Sim {Hauhulh-Thanhrang}, better known as Laitong. Other Lai languages are Mi-E (including Khuaksim), and the Zokhua dialect of Hakha spoken in Zokhua village.Ethnologue: Chin, Hakha (Lai Chin). SIL International, 2019. Lai languages are used mainly in central townships of Chin State which include Hakha, Falam, Matupi and Thantlang. Although Hakha Lai dialect is not a tonal language, it shares majority of the vocabularies with Falam Lai]. Therefore, it is intelligible between Falam Lai and Hakha Lai. Falam Lai language is very close to its sibling Mizo language, chiefly used in Mizoram state India. Due to its closeness to the Mizo language, Falam Lai language vocabularies have been seen quite common in Mizo language. It is probably due to history that some of Mizo have been living in the west part of Chin State before they migrated to the current Mizoram. History also said that the Mizo language is derived from the Zahau (Lai) language.But actually Mizo is a mixture of Zo Hmar, Paite, Lai/Pawi, Mara/Lakher, Bawm, Thadou, Ralte, etc etc and many more. In fact, it was earliar known as Duhlian »õawng  History  According to Thomas Han Tai, British soldier Lieutenant R. Steward Hudson developed the first writing system of Chin dialects in 1857 AD. Lai language is written with the Roman alphabet. D.J.C. MacNabb, B.Sc., political officer in Haka, wrote the first Lai language writing handbook, \\"The Handbook of Haka or Baungshe Dialect of Chin Language,\\" printed by Superintendent, Government Printing Press, Rangoon, in 1891. In 1894 Surgeon Major A.G.E Newland (IMS) redeveloped the Lai writing system and published a book called \\"A Practical Hand Book of the Lais as spoken by the Hakas and other allied tribes of the Chin Hills (Commonly the Baungshe dialect),\\" printed by the Superintendent, Government Printing, Burma, 1897. Later, the first Chin Hill missionaries Rev. Arthur E. Carson and Laura Carson arrived in Haka on 15 March 1899. With the arrival of Rev. Dr. Tilbe in 1900 in Haka, he and Rev. Arthur Carson researched the Lai writing system developed by Major A.G.E Newland. Still, the latest version of the Lai writing system is far from perfection. Examples of Lai writing system developed by Rev. Arthur Carson and Rev. Dr. Tilbe: * Lai Relnak Tsa Ok * A zhul Tu An Twa Hser Nak * Hla Tsa Ok In modern writing: * Lai Relnak Cauk * A Zultu An Tuahsernak In 1908, Rev. Joseph Herbert Cope and his wife arrived in Haka city and revamped the Lai writing system. After Rev. Dr. Chester U Strait and his wife arrived in Haka in 1925, they upgraded the Hakha Lai writing system to almost perfection. Thus, when the last American Baptist Missionary Rev. Dr. Robert G. Johnson and his wife arrived in Haka in 1947, there were not many errors to fix and redevelop. Therefore, they translated the Holy Bible into Hakha Lai language in accordance with the Lai grammar finalized by Dr. Cope and Dr. Strait.  Falam Lai or Laizo or Lai≈£ong or Zopau or Zotawng  The language used in Falam township is called \\"Lai≈£ong\\" and is used as common media by the peoples of Lai tribes around Falam. It is currently used as the Chin official language in Myanmar indigenous radio broadcasting program. Falam Lai is regarded as the easiest dialect to learn in Chin State. The local peoples from Falam called it \\"Lai≈£ong\\" where '≈£ong' means 'language'. The current official Chin language is Falam Lai dialect since the early 20th century. Though there are numerous dialects among the ethnic Chin, they all have links and similarities, which make them easy to understand each other. After studying several years on all the dialects among the Chins, the research concluded that the Falam Lai dialect has the commonest and the most understood language over all chin tribes including Mizos. It is recognized as the Chin official language with the British scholars and is learned throughout Falam areas until the junta disallowed to continue in the late 20th century. The common understanding of Falam Lai throughout Chin state could be partially be attributed to Falam's former reputation as capital and its important historical events such as the first public school in the entire Chin State was the No. 1 Basic Education High School in Falam. Before schools in other towns were established, residents from nearby towns would attend school here and adapt to Falam community, and subsequently learn the language. Still now, Falam Lai dialect is being practiced as official Chin language in Myanmar as in radio broadcasting.  Hakha Lai or Baungshe Language  The emergence of terminology of Hakha Lai is one of the reason where Lai language is more diversified than as known. CACC calls it Hakha station language. Unlike other dialects, Baungshe is not a tonal language. That's the reason why the accent or tone of Baungshe dialect speakers differs from township to township and village to village. Therefore, the orthography, phonology and some the vocabularies used in one township may not be used in other townships. However, there is almost no discrepancy of vocabularies between Hakha Lai used in capital Haka / Hakha, Matupi and Thantlang townships. Matupi town has its own dialect known Matuholh or Matu Lai. It is the next kin of Hakha Lai. The Bible in Matu language has been successfully translated by Rev. Chan Thleng from Matupi. He is both expert in Matu and Hakha Lai. However, due to a very poor transportation and communication between Hakha and Matupi, the Hakha Lai influence and progress in Matupi is weak.  Academic Perspective of Lai  From an academic perspective, Falam Lai and Haka Lai are both Lai languages. Even with their linguistic variations, the languages should be studied together, because they are closely interrelated. Lai languages are probably the richest among dialects in the Chin State. Due to the research of Lai experts in the Chin State, a very interesting flow of adjectives and adverbs has been discovered, paving the way for a better understanding of Lai grammar. Despite this, much of the structure of these languages is still unknown, and they are still under debate by linguistic experts. References *Stephen Ni Kio, Lai Nunphung. *Hakha Lai - By David A.

Medea was Italian-born (her original surname was Mei) but she became completely Russianized after marrying Nikolay. They had separate careers before their wedding, and again after their divorce in 1904, but during the 15 years of their marriage they almost always sang in the same performances. They created the main tenor and soprano roles in two operas by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ‚Äì The Queen of Spades and Iolanta ‚Äì and appeared in a number of other important Russian musical premieres. Nikolay Figner Nikolay Nikolayevich Figner was born in Nikiforovka, near Kazan, on 9/21 February 1857.Tchaikovsky Research He was a brother of the famous \\"People's Will\\" revolutionary, Vera Figner (1852‚Äì1942). He joined the Russian Navy as a midshipman, and rose to the rank of lieutenant, retiring in 1881 to study voice with Vassily Samus, I. P. Pryanishnikova and Camille Everardi at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Figner then travelled to Italy, where he made his debut at Naples in Gounod's Phil√©mon et Baucis in 1882. He sang at the San Carlo Theatre and appeared at other Italian venues for a number of years. While in Italy, Figner took the opportunity to study with the prominent singing teacher Francesco Lamperti and also received instruction from E. de Roxas. Figner performed, too, in Madrid, Bucharest and London (at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden).Michael Scott. The Record of Singing: To 1914. 1977: p. 215 He travelled to South America as well during this period. On 4 November 1886, in Turin, he sang the principal tenor role in the world premiere of the revised version of Alfredo Catalani's Edmea; this was also the occasion of Arturo Toscanini's first appearance as a conductor in Italy after his initial triumph in South America.David Mason Greene. Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers: p. 819Mortimer H. Frank. Arturo Toscanini: The NBC Years: p. 149 During his travels, he sang roles such as Arnold in Rossini's William Tell, the Duke in Verdi's Rigoletto, and Carlo in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix. He also happened to appear on stage with Medea Mei in a production of Donizetti's La favorite; they formed a liaison, and he brought her back to Russia in 1887. Two years later, they wed. Figner soon established himself as the leading tenor at the Mariinsky Theatre, retaining this status until 1903. Other Russian composers whose operas he sang were Alexander Borodin (Vladimir in Prince Igor), Alexander Dargomyzhsky (the Prince in Rusalka), and Anton Rubinstein (Sinodal in The Demon). A good-looking man, he projected a memorable stage presence and sang with sensitivity and style. Medea Mei- Figner Medea Mei was born in Florence, Italy, on 4 March 1859. She studied there with Bianchi, Carozzi-Zucchi and Panofka. She sang the mezzo-soprano role in Verdi's Requiem at the young age of 16, and made her operatic debut soon afterwards, as Azucena in Il trovatore, at Sinalunga. She became well known throughout Italy, and also toured Spain, South America and Russia and visited London. Her repertoire then included Ulrica in Un ballo in maschera, Amneris in Aida, Gertrude in Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet, Leonora in Donizetti's La favorite, and the title role in Bizet's Carmen. She latter added soprano roles such as Charlotte in Massenet's Werther, and Margherita in Boito's Mefistofele. Medea Mei-Figner Medea went to Russia with Nikolay Figner in 1887, making her debut there on 8 May at the St Petersburg Imperial Opera (the Mariinsky Theatre) as Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. The soprano knew no Russian at that time, and sang in Italian during the first two St Petersburg seasons. Subsequently, she was received into the Russian Orthodox Church, and married Figner on 20 February 1889. Thereafter, Nikolay made it his practice to sing only in operas in which Medea was also singing. She was referred to after marriage as either Medea Mei-Figner (the form of her name used in most Western reference books) or simply Medea Figner. Furthermore, she was given the patronymic of Ivanovna, and is sometimes designated as Medea (or Medeya) Ivanovna (Mei-)Figner. She eventually mastered Russian to such an extent that native speakers could not tell she had learned it only from the age of 30. Notably, Medea appeared as Mimi in the first performance of Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me in Russia; she was coached by Puccini himself. Medea Mei- Figner is the great-great-grandmother of the Italian soprano Amarilli Nizza.MTG LiricaL'Unit√† The Figners perform as a team Both the Figners were considered to be outstanding actors: their first appearance together in Bizet's Carmen, as Carmen and Don Jos√©, produced an ovation said to be unprecedented in the history of Russian opera. They were highly regarded by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who wrote the roles of Hermann and Liza in The Queen of Spades for them. They created the roles in the world premiere of this opera, on 19 December 1890, after rehearsing under Tchaikovsky's personal supervision. Medea was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time. In 1891, when she was unable to continue to appear in The Queen of Spades due to her condition, Nikolay refused to sing with a substitute soprano, and so the opera was removed from the program until Medea was able to return.Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man, p. 524 The Figners also created the title soprano role and that of the tenor part of Count Vaud√©mont in Tchaikovsky's opera Iolanta in 1892. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Six Romances, Op. 73 (1893) to Nikolay Figner.Tchaikovsky Research Nikolay spent time with Tchaikovsky in the days following the premiere of his Symphony No. 6 Pathetique.Poznansky, p. 578 Later, he visited Modest Tchaikovsky's apartment during the composer's final illness. He returned there immediately after Tchaikovsky's death, helping Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov to lay out the body. By no means, however, did the Figners confine their joint operatic activities to the compositions of Tchaikovsky. For example, they created the main roles in Eduard N√°pravn√≠k's Dubrovsky and Francesca da Rimini.Michael Scott: p. 143 Other operas in which the Figners performed as a team included: Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin (Nikolay's Lensky was said to have been surpassed only by Leonid Sobinov's interpretation) and The Oprichnik; Verdi's Aida, La traviata and Otello (singing in the latter work's 1889 Russian premiere);Opera Today Gounod's Faust and Rom√©o et Juliette; Auber's Fra Diavolo; and the Russian premieres of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Puccini's Tosca and Leoncavallo's Pagliacci.Tick now.com Oddly, they never appeared in works written by Rimsky-Korsakov, who was the most prolific operatic composer in Tsarist Russia. It has been suggested that the reason for this gap in their repertoire was personal: they had asked Rimsky-Korsakov to write an opera for them, or to make some changes to his existing work May Night, but the composer apparently refused to oblige and this may have offended the Figners. Divorce, later lives and recorded legacy The Figners divorced in 1904. Medea made a tour of South America and returned to continue a solo career at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. From 1910 to 1915 Nikolay directed and sang with the Narodny Dom opera company in Saint Petersburg. Medea's farewell performance was in the title role in Carmen in 1912. In 1917 Nikolay moved to the Ukraine, where he taught at the Kiev Conservatory. He lost most of his possessions during the Russian Revolution of 1917, and died in poverty in Kiev on 13 December 1918, aged 61. Medea left Soviet Russia in 1930 and settled in Paris, where she died on 8 July 1952, at the age of 93.Cantabile- subito Both of their voices can be heard on the LP anthology The Record of Singing, while a comprehensive selection of their recordings was released on compact disc by the Symposium label in 2000. This double set of CDs bears the catalogue numbers 1255/1256. Importantly, Medea Mei-Figner recorded \\"Lisa's aria\\" from The Queen of Spades with the alternative low ending sanctioned by the composer. She also made discs of \\"Vissi d'arte\\" from Tosca and arias from Werther and Carmen, as well as recording a number of songs, including \\"Penso\\" by Paolo Tosti. Her voice was considered by contemporary critics to be more beautiful and more impressive than that of her husband. He was already past his vocal prime when he and his wife cut their first series of 78-rpm records in St Petersburg in 1901‚Äì02 for EMI's predecessor, the Gramophone & Typewriter Company. The Danish journalist Knut de Hageman-Lindenkrone conducted a long recorded interview with Medea Mei at her Parisian apartment in 1949, when the singer was 90 years old. The interview is in French, although Medea Mei may be heard to speak as well in Italian and Russian with her daughter, who was also present. She even sings a few bars of music here and there, including both the first phrase and the last from Liza's aria, 'Midnight is Approaching', from Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, which she had created 59 years before. This fascinating hour-long interview, with unique memories of Tchaikovsky and other fabled events of Mme Mei's Saint-Petersburg career, was included in a Rubini Records set of two long-playing records, c. 1975, that also featured Medea Mei-Figner's complete commercially recorded output from the beginning of the 20th century.

Any prenol with more than 4 isoprene units is a polyprenol. Polyprenols play an important function acting as natural bioregulators and are found in small quantities in various plant tissues. Dolichols, which are found in all living creatures, including humans, are their 2,3-dihydro derivatives. Sources Live trees are known to contain polyprenols. The needles of conifer trees are one of the richest sources of polyprenols. They are also present in shiitake mushrooms in trace amounts. Research Polyprenols have been studied for more than 30 years. Interest has been strongest in Russia, Europe, Japan, India, and the United States. In the early 1930s, a scientific team at the Forest Technical Academy in St Petersburg, Russia led by Fyodor Solodky, the founder of Forest Biochemistry, and Asney Agranet, began research into the composition of conifer tree needles. They were intrigued by the trees' ability to remain disease free in extremes of temperature ¬± 40 ¬∞C. Development of Solodky's research led Russian scientists to isolate a completely different class of organic substance from the needles, including polyprenols. Functions Polyprenols are low molecular natural bioregulators (physiologically active), playing a significant modulating role in the cellular process in plants referred to as biosynthesis. What polyprenols are to plants, dolichols are to all living creatures, including man. They are in fact of a very similar chemical composition. Dolichols are a derivative of polyprenols with a saturated isoprene unit. Through dolichols, the dolichol phosphate cycle occurs. The dolichol phosphate cycle plays a major role in the synthesis of glycoproteins. All proteins from secretions, membranes and intracellular glycoproteins form the basis for the building of membrane receptors which are used in the production of insulin, adrenaline, estrogen, testosterone and other hormones and enzymes. Seemingly, dolichols have an important role in maintenance of the correct lipid composition of membranes. Decreased levels of dolichols are registered with acute rheumatism and other immunodeficient conditions. The dolichol phosphate cycle facilitates the process of cellular membrane glycosylation, that is, the synthesis of glycoproteins that control the interactions of cells, support the immune system and the stabilization of protein molecules. Out of all these glycoproteins, polyglycoprotein has the capacity to kill cancerous cells during chemotherapy whilst protecting healthy cells within the body. The pharmacological activity of polyprenols takes place in the liver where they are metabolized into dolichols.  Potential medical applications  The interest in polyprenols and dolichols is associated with their wide range of demonstrated biological activity and extremely low toxicity. Polyprenols stimulate the immune system, cellular reparation and spermatogenesis, and have antistress, adaptogenic, antiulcerogenic and wound- healing activity.Roschin V.I.

Edited by V.G. Bespalov and V.B. Nekrasova, SPb. Eskulap, 2000, pp.114-116 Dolichols have antioxidant activity and protect cell membranes from peroxidation. Experiments on mice have demonstrated that polyprenols have antiviral activity, in particular against influenza viruses. It has been established that the dolichol level in liver tumor cells are reduced in comparison with healthy hepatic cells. The Australian pharmaceutical company Solagran Limited has been investigating the medical significance of polyprenols.

Early Life and Education  Salian was born in Mangalore and initially studied art, before moving to Mumbai in 1982 and studying law.  Career   Chief Public Prosecutor for Sessions Court, Mumbai  Salian was a public prosecutor for the State of Maharashtra, and served as the Chief Public Prosecutor for the State of Maharashtra in the Sessions Court, Mumbai, from 2001 to 2007. Salian is a leading Indian public prosecutor in the sessions court. Salian has handled several important cases such as the Borivali double murders,case, the J J shootout case, the Sara Sahara shopping complex case and the Ghatkopar and Mulund blast cases.  Special Prosecutor - TADA, MCOCA, and POTA  In 1994, Salian was appointed as a special prosecutor for cases filed under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act. Later, she was also appointed to prosecute cases under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002.  Notable Cases under TADA, MCOCA and POTA  = JJ Hospital Shootings = In 1992, Salian prosecuted Subhash Thakur, Brijesh Singh, Pappu Kalani, and others associated with mob leader Dawood Ibrahim for a shooting that took place in J.J. Hospital in Mumbai. Salian on behalf of the State of Maharashtra argued that the accused had entered the hospital and shot and killed Shailash Haldankar, who was associated with a rival gang lead by Arun Gawli, as an act of revenge for the murder of a member of Ibrahim's family. They were also charged with the deaths of two police constables, who were killed while on duty at the hospital. They were charged under the provisions of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). A special court constituted under TADA convicted nine people for the shootings, and acquitted three. The case is still ongoing, with appeals being heard. = March 2003 Mumbai Bombing = Salian acted as a special prosecutor in the case concerning a bomb explosion on a train that was at Mulund Railway Station in Mumbai, which resulted in the deaths of twelve people. Fifteen people were charged in a special court for offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Two of the accused died during the course of the trial, and the remaining thirteen were convicted in 2016.  Malegaon Blast Case and Criticism of Government  In 2015, Salian publicly criticised the National Investigation Agency, stating that officials within the organisation had attempted to prevent her from prosecuting the accused in the 2006 Malegaon bombings incident. Salian stated that the policy concerning the prosecution of the case had changed since the NDA government lead by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had come to power in 2014, and that she had been asked to 'go soft' on the accused as they were linked to Hindu extremists. In response to her allegations, a criminal contempt case was filed against Salian by a resident of Mumbai, Sanjay Lakhe Patil. In an affidavit filed in the case concerning this contempt case, Salian named the NIA officers who had sought to interfere with her prosecution of the Malegaon bombings incident. Her allegations were denied by the NIA, which subsequently dropped charges against the accused in the case. Salian was discharged as Special Public Prosecutor from the case, following her allegations. Following this, in September 2015, activist Harsh Mander filed a Public Interest Litigation petition at the Supreme Court of India, seeking their intervention to ensure a fair trial in the Malegaon case and accusing the NDA government of interfering with the prosecutor's ability to prosecute the case. The case was initially placed before a bench consisting of Justice U.U. Lalit and Justice F. M. I. Khalifulla; however, Justice Lalit recused himself on the grounds that he had previously appeared for some of the accused.  Private Practice  After retiring from public office, Salian returned to private practice and has been working as a defence lawyer in criminal matters, in Mumbai.

IMDb. Retrieved August 23, 2009. It follows an arrogant prince and his brother on a quest to kill the sorcerer and save the bride and their father's kingdom. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $28 million worldwide against a $50 million budget. Plot Thadeous and Fabious are sons of King Tallious in the Kingdom of Mourne. Fabious is dashing and skilled and Thadeous is lazy and ineffectual. While celebrating his latest victory over the evil sorcerer, Leezar, who has been ravaging Tallious's kingdom, Fabious introduces the virgin Belladonna whom he has freed from a tower and wishes to marry. Though his brother makes him the best man, Thadeous skips the wedding after overhearing Fabious' Knights Elite, led by Boremont, talk about him negatively. The wedding is then crashed by Leezar, who reveals himself to be the one who placed Belladonna in the tower. Leezar re-kidnaps her and flees. Returning to the castle with his servant and best friend Courtney, Thadeous is given an ultimatum: join Fabious on his quest to rescue Belladonna or be banished from Mourne. Visiting the Great Wize Wizard, Thadeous and Fabious learn that Leezar is attempting to fulfill a prophecy of a warlock having sex with a maiden when the two moons converge, impregnating her with a dragon that will allow him to take over King Tallious' kingdom. To destroy Leezar, they are given a magic compass that will lead them to the Blade of Unicorn, located within a labyrinth. On the way there, they learn Fabious's eunuch slave, Julie, has been reporting to Leezar of their progress and that the Knights Elite are serving the warlock. Fabious sends his mechanical bird Simon to tell the king of the betrayal by the Knights Elite and request reinforcements. Thadeous, Fabious and Courtney are captured by nymphs led by Marteetee, who imprisons them at an arena, where Fabious kills off Marteetee's finest warrior. In retaliation, Marteetee summons a hydra-like monster to kill them. The brothers are rescued by Isabel, a warrior seeking revenge for her father's murder at Marteetee's hands. Isabel is later seen going for a swim by Thadeous and Fabious. Later that night, Thadeous learns that Isabel is also after Leezar for the slaughter of her brothers. The next day, the party learns too late that Isabel stole the compass from Thadeous. Fabious, finally angered by his brother's selfishness, decides to find the Blade of Unicorn alone as Thadeous and Courtney go to a tavern, where they find Isabel and retrieve the compass. But finding that his brother has been captured by Leezar's men, Thadeous wins Isabel over as they join forces, entering the labyrinth where they encounter a Minotaur. After becoming separated from the others, Thadeous retrieves the Blade of Unicorn and slays the Minotaur. Thadeous and his group make their way to Leezar's castle and free Fabious, giving him the Sword of Unicorn. As the others kill off Julie, Boremont and his men and Leezar's three witches, Fabious impales Leezar with the Blade of Unicorn, to prevent him from raping Belladonna. After their victory, Isabel leaves for another quest and the heroes return home. Some time later, Fabious and Belladonna marry, while Thadeous is approached by a returning Isabel, who reveals that she has fallen in love with him. However, for them to have sex, he must first slay the witch who has cast a spell on her, locking her in a chastity belt. Though not in the mood to go out, Isabel's suggestion convinces him to go on a new adventure.

Instead he hoped to, with star Danny McBride, \\"put our stamp on it and bring our sensibility to it, but work within the genre.\\" Early on, according to Green, Universal was nervous about the prospects of the film, believing it to be a parody. However, their minds were eased when discussing the casting, \\"and that we weren't filling it with comedian cameos.\\" Filming began in the summer of 2009 in Northern Ireland, at historic locations such as Dunluce Castle, Cairncastle and Shane's Castle, and it concluded in October 2009.How Danny McBride will tweak fantasy in Your Highness, with Natalie Portman. Blastr. Retrieved August 23, 2009. Although Green wanted to make the film epic in scale, they were hampered by a limited budget. Ad libbing and improv were encouraged on set, although Green has implied that the extent of this has been exaggerated, adding, \\"There was definitely more of a script here than anything I‚Äôve ever worked on\\". Still, at least one notable part of the backstory was improvised, which was the idea that the Wizard molested James Franco's character as a youth. McBride has said that he was certain that the scene where this was revealed would be cut, and he was shocked when it appeared in the final film. Marketing A red-band trailer was released on IGN and Funny or Die. On December 21, 2010, a green- band trailer was released online, and shown before screenings of Little Fockers and The Dilemma. On March 23, 2011, a second red-band trailer was released.

Critical reception Your Highness received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 27%, based on 179 reviews, with an average rating of 4.27/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Big budgets and costumes in service of scatalogical jokes may seem funny on paper, but in execution this is a highly monotonous romp that registers only occasional laughs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 31 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four, calling it \\"juvenile excrescence that feels like the work of 11-year-old boys in love with dungeons, dragons, warrior women, pot, boobs and four-letter words.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave it a C+, with Natalie Portman favorably reviewed as \\"fierce and funny as a babe warrior...good with dirty words\\". The L.A. Times noted the \\"even but fun sword-and-sandals sendup...is at its best when it's at its silliest\\", while the lowbrow humor is \\"sometimes witless and sometimes winning comedy...begins with grade-school-level graffiti being scrawled across storybook pages and goes up and down from there. Still, the fun can be infectious...a farce within a farce...tawdry tale of the bothered and bewildered Kingdom of Mourne\\". David Edelstein of the New York magazine gave a favorable review, describing the film as \\"a cunning weave of low and high\\". Yahoo! described the \\"Raunchy Sex Comedy Wrapped Up in a Noble Quest\\" as \\"overall, sets and scenery were fantastic and photography was incredible...a awesome, piece of foolishness wrapped up as a Period Piece...more in common with American Pie than it did to Lord of the Rings. Richard Corliss, who admired McBride's and Green's earlier work, said he felt a \\"kind of head-swiveling awe in Your Highness‚Äòs concentration of aimless inanity, in the purity of its devotion to its own louche principles. Like members of some post-Dadaist collective, the filmmakers have dedicated themselves to memorializing every first, wrong impulse that popped into their heads, while ruthlessly excising any vestige of wit or narrative niceties as being too linear, dude.\\" James Franco received a Razzie nomination for Worst Supporting Actor for the film, but lost to Al Pacino in Jack and Jill.] James Franco would later poke fun at the film's poor reception during his Comedy Central Roast, saying ‚ÄúI agreed to do this roast because I wanted to do something I‚Äôve never done before ‚Äî something that has zero artistic value, something nobody will remember three months from now, something that‚Äôs offensive, homophobic, and stars horrifically untalented people and something that‚Äôs only a big deal to a handful of teenage stoners on Twitter. You might say, ‚ÄòJames, didn‚Äôt you just describe Your Highness?' I wouldn‚Äôt know, I didn‚Äôt see Your Highness.‚Äù On his first-ever interview on The Howard Stern Show to promote the film Spring Breakers, Franco was surprised to hear Stern compliment Your Highness, asking incredulously, \\"you liked that?\\" He attributed the film's lackluster performance to its \\"tricky\\" blend of lowbrow humor and medieval swords and sorcerers, a combination that hadn't worked well since Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

A pan-Somalist, he was the Vice President of the Government Council of French Somaliland from 1957 to December 1958, during Djibouti's pre-independence period.Djibouti - Worldstatesmen.com Biography Harbi was born in Ali Sabieh, Djibouti in 1921 to a Somali family from the Fourlaba sub-clan of the Issa clan.Touval, p.125 He learned to read the Koran and linguistics Arab from a young age, and when he was seventeen his father died in 1938. He was forced to work and headed towards the capital Djibouti and worked there as a waiter in one of the restaurants and while he became aware of visitors to the restaurant, most of whom were foreign tourists and benefited from cultural differences. He volunteer, sailor in the French Navy with the brother of the Sultan of Tadjoura, Ibrahim Mohamed in the Second World War. He nearly lost his life when the French warship crashed, which was being served where the Germans in the Mediterranean Sea, but he went to France. He later joined the colonial army, and was awarded the French Croix de guerre in World War II.Hempstone, p.158 Political career When he returned to Djibouti in 1946, and began his career working in the port of Djibouti, and then became president of the Union of Somali workers, and in 1947 founded the Democratic Union Party, which branched off from the union, he was able in his youth that dominates the political scene for a decade. He increased his circle of friends in the Middle East through gifts such as the lions he gave to the Imam of Yemen and the King of Saudi Arabia who in return (as is customary) backed him with funds. Harbi's main political rival was Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who in the mid-1950s allegedly expressed a desire to see all foreigners expelled from Djibouti. Harbi capitalized on the blunder by coming to the defense of the foreign communities. As a consequence, he gained the material support of the resident Arabs in general and of Ali Coubeche in particular, son of one of the territory's wealthier merchants.Virginia Thompson, Richard Adloff, Djibouti and the Horn of Africa, (Stanford University Press: 1968), pp.65-66. Harbi would later appoint Coubeche as Finance Minister in his Cabinet.Virginia Thompson, Richard Adloff, Djibouti and the Horn of Africa, (Stanford University Press: 1968), p.68. Through the Sultan of Tadjoura, a former comrade in the French army during the World War II campaign, Harbi was introduced to Ali Aref Bourhan, a young Afar politician whom Harbi would eventually take under his wing. Bourhan subsequently served in the territory's representative council as a Harbist politician, strongly supporting Harbi's independence-oriented platform.Jacques Foccart et Ali Aref In 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a referendum was held in French Somaliland to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The plebiscite turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans.Barrington, Lowell, After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States, (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115 There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p.360. The majority of those who had voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as Harbi had proposed. After the launch of French President Charles de Gaulle, which states that France be with the republics that accept this Constitution, Mahmoud who campaign against the constitution and demanded the right to decide the fate of the French colony in the Horn of Africa, and he led a demonstration against the Constitution of de Gaulle, Vobad for presidency government, and dismissed as well as all the ministers who supported his position. On September 29, 1960, he and his comrades Djama Mahamoud Boreh and Mohamed Gahanlo disappeared on a flight from Geneva to Cairo. Officially, they were killed in a plane crash, but a possible role of the organization de l'arm√©e secr√®te is speculated. He went to African and European capitals in order to reach the goal of liberation before he died.United States Joint Publications Research Service, Translations on Sub-Saharan Africa, Issues 464-492, (1966), p.24. Later years Harbi would eventually settle in Mogadishu, where he frequently joined Somali radio programs and preached Pan-Somalism to the Somalis of the Horn of Africa. In 29 September 1960, he and several of his associates died in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances in Italy on a return trip from China to Somalia.

It is commonly called Waling-waling in the Philippines and is also called Sander's Vanda, after Henry Frederick Conrad Sander, a noted orchidologist. The orchid is considered to be the \\"Queen of Philippine flowers\\" and is worshiped as a diwata by the indigenous Bagobo people. Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach named as Vanda sanderiana. It has two forms, pink and white, also referred to as alba. M. Roebelin discovered the original pink variety in the Philippines in 1881 or 1882. Rudolf Schlechter separated Euanthe from Vanda in 1914 due to structural differences in the flowers.( lack of spur ) For breeding purposes and registration by the Royal Horticultural Society, however, it is still treated as a Vanda. Vanda sanderiana is endemic to Mindanao in the provinces of Davao, Cotabato, and Zamboanga where it is found on the trunks of dipterocarp trees at elevations below 500 meters. Over-collected, the plant is considered rare in nature. It is often used in hybridization. Studies have shown that when raised at high altitude, the plant bears flowers early. In 2004, there had been a motion in the House of Representatives of the Philippines to declare the \\"Waling-waling\\" as the country's national flower, replacing the Sampaguita. In 2013, a bill was passed by the Philippine Senate declaring the Waling-waling as a national flower alongside the Sampaguita. However, the House Bill 5655 was vetoed by President Aquino citing that there are other means to promote the protection and preservation of the Waling Waling Orchid without declaring it a second national flower.  Varieties  The Philippine Orchid Society, which incorporates an image of the flower in its logo, states that the species has three varieties: * Vanda sanderiana var. albata Reichb. f. in Gard. Chron. ser. 3.2 (1887) 9. Esmeralda sanderiana var. albata Will :Described by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1887, the plant's flower size is smaller than that of the species. Its lateral sepals are yellowish-green with white margins. Its dorsal sepal and petals are white with purple spots at the base. The labellum has purple dots. This plant was reported from Davao del Sur and South Cotabato on Mindanao Island where it grows as an epiphyte at elevations to 500 meters. This variety is now extremely rare in its natural habitat. * Vanda sanderiana var. froebeliana Cogn. in Dict. Icon. des. Orch.Vanda t. 12 a (1903) :This variety has bright rose flower stalks and has very large flowers compared to the species. The lateral sepals are bright yellow, with rose coloration towards the margins and densely covered with large purple reticulated veins. The dorsal sepal and petals are rose-colored on the upper half, while the lower half has brownish- purple spots. * Vanda sanderiana var. labello-viridi Linden & Rodigas in Lindenia 1:85, t (1885) 40. Esmeralda sanderiana var. labello-viridi Will :This variety is similar to the species, with the exception that the lip or labellum is green with crimson stripes.

It shows a major shift in his musical focus, and demonstrates Yusuf Islam's journey from that of a pop star to a Muslim performer, who began a slow return to recording music, beginning with a song written for his daughter Hasannah, \\"A is for Allah\\", after finding that few children's songs were available not just to entertain, but to acquaint young people with Islamic teachings. During this period, Yusuf employed only the use of voice and drums in recording these songs, due to a lack of consensus among the Islamic community regarding whether the use of musical instruments were permitted. Other than the songs written, Yusuf recorded nasheeds, spoken word, and Muslim prayers, as with the traditional call to prayer, the A·∏èhƒÅn. Yusuf added his own touches to a very old Middle Eastern folk song, Tala'al Badru Alayna, adding a Western folk sound with melody and harmonics, and translating some of the verses into English from the original Arabic, so that the song might be understood in more than one language. In addition to the newer songs, Yusuf Islam added some of his popular hits from the 1970s, when he was a singer-songwriter in the folk rock genre. The songs from that time are \\"Peace Train\\", \\"Wild World\\", and \\"The Wind\\". The album includes a 24-page song booklet of lyrics along with comments from Yusuf about each track.

The passage of laws that discriminate against LGBT people have been shown to have significant negative impacts on the physical and mental health and well-being of LGBT youth; for example, depression and drug use among LGBT people have been shown to increase significantly after the passage of discriminatory laws. By contrast, the passage of laws that recognize LGBT people as equal with regard to civil rights may have significant positive impacts on the physical and mental health and well-being of LGBT youth; for example, a study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation (LGBT youth), resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. Bullying of LGBT youth has been shown to be a contributing factor in many suicides, even if not all of the attacks have been specifically regarding sexuality or gender. Since a series of suicides in the early 2000s, more attention has been focused on the issues and underlying causes in an effort to reduce suicides among LGBT youth. Research by the Family Acceptance Project has demonstrated that \\"parental acceptance, and even neutrality, with regard to a child's sexual orientation\\" can bring down the attempted suicide rate.Study: Tolerance Can Lower Gay Kids' Suicide Risk, Joseph Shapiro, All Things Considered, National Public Radio, December 29, 2008.

Reports and studies Clinical social worker Caitlin Ryan's Family Acceptance Project (San Francisco State University) conducted the first study of the effect of family acceptance and rejection on the health, mental health and well-being of LGBT youth, including suicide, HIV/AIDS and homelessness.Helping LGBT youth, others learn to cope, April 27, 2012, Visalia Times-Delta. Their research shows that LGBT youths \\"who experience high levels of rejection from their families during adolescence (when compared with those young people who experienced little or no rejection from parents and caregivers) were more than eight times likely to have attempted suicide, more than six times likely to report high levels of depression, more than three times likely to use illegal drugs and more than three times likely to be at high risk for HIV or other STDs\\" by the time they reach their early 20s. Numerous studies have shown that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth have a higher rate of suicide attempts than do heterosexual youth. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center synthesized these studies and estimated that between 5 and 10% of LGBT youth, depending on age and sex groups, have attempted suicide, a rate 1.5-3 times higher than heterosexual youth. A U.S. government study, titled Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, published in 1989, found that LGBT youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people. This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to minority stress. \\"More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year,\\" making it \\"the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers.\\" It is impossible to know the exact suicide rate of LGBT youth because sexuality and gender minorities are often hidden and even unknown, particularly in this age group. Further research is currently being done to explain the prevalence of suicide among LGBT youths.\\"Sexual Orientation and Youth Suicide\\" by Dr. Gary Remafedi, October 6, 1999, retrieved 2 May 2006.\\"Youth suicide risk and sexual orientation - Statistical Data Included\\" by Rutter, Philip A & Soucar, Emil, Summer 2002, retrieved 2 May 2006.Articles Relating to Suicide by GLB Youth, retrieved 3 May 2006. In terms of school climate, \\"approximately 25 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students and university employees have been harassed due to their sexual orientation, as well as a third of those who identify as transgender, according to the study and reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education.\\" Research has found the presence of gay-straight alliances (GSAs) in schools is associated with decreased suicide attempts; in a study of LGBT youth, ages 13‚Äì22, 16.9% of youth who attended schools with GSAs attempted suicide versus 33.1% of students who attended schools without GSAs. \\"LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say that they do not feel safe at school (22% vs. 7%) and 90% of LGBT students (vs. 62% of non-LGBT teens) have been harassed or assaulted during the past year.\\" In addition, \\"LGBTQ students were more likely than heterosexual students to have seriously considered leaving their institution as a result of harassment and discrimination.\\" Susan Rankin, a contributing author to the report in Miami, found that \\"Unequivocally, The 2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People demonstrates that LGBT students, faculty and staff experience a ‚Äòchilly‚Äô campus climate of harassment and far less than welcoming campus communities.\\" The internet is also an important factor for LGBT. An international study found that suicidal LGBT showed important differences with suicidal heterosexuals, in a matched-pairs study. That study found suicidal LGBT were more likely to communicate suicidal intentions, more likely to search for new friends online, and found more support online than did suicidal heterosexuals. The black transgender and gender non-conforming community has been found to face discrimination to a higher degree than the rest of the transgender community, which is due to the intersection of racism and transphobia. Research has found that this community experiences a higher level of poverty, suicide attempts, and harassment, while the effects of HIV and being refused health care due to transphobia and/or racism are greater as well. The National LGBTQ task force conducted a survey to discern these trends among the black transgender non-conforming community in with the overall transgender community. The survey found that amongst the black respondents 49% reported having attempted suicide. Additional findings were that this group reported that 26% are unemployed and 34% reported an annual income of less than $10,000 per year. 42% of respondents reported homelessness which is five times the rate of the US homelessness rate. Also, the report revealed that the black transgender or gender non-conforming community reported 20.23% were living with HIV. 27% of black transgender youth reported being physically assaulted, 15% were sexually assaulted and 21% left school due to these instances of harassment. Impact of same-sex marriage The establishment of the legal right of same-sex marriage in the United States is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation (LGB youth). In Denmark and Sweden, same-sex married couples have a higher suicide rate than opposite-sex married couples, though the discrepancy is trending toward disappearing.  United States  A study of nationwide data from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed an association between states that established same-sex marriage and reduced rates of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9‚Äì12, with a rate reduction in all schoolchildren (LGB and non-LGB youth) in grades 9‚Äì12 declining by 7% and a rate reduction among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation (LGB youth) in grades 9‚Äì12 of 14%, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from 1 state in 2004 to all 50 states in 2015) allowed the researchers to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that \\"laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future\\". Other research shows that while this nationwide study has shown an association between states that established same-sex marriage and reduced rates of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9‚Äì12, it does not show causation.  Denmark and Sweden  In Denmark and Sweden, adults in same-sex marriages are still more likely to commit suicide than those in opposite-sex marriages; however, the suicide rate for all married people (for both same-sex and opposite-sex marriages) has been decreasing and equalizing. Those who entered same-sex marriages in the past (between 1989‚Äì2002) were 2.8 times more likely to commit suicide than those who entered opposite-sex marriages, while those who entered same-sex marriages more recently (between 2003‚Äì2016) were only 1.5 times more likely than opposite-sex married people to kill themselves. Those who entered opposite-sex marriages in the more recent time bracket had a suicide rate 28% lower than for those who entered marriages in the earlier time bracket. Developmental psychology perspectives The diathesis-stress model suggests that biological vulnerabilities predispose individuals to different conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and mental health conditions like major depression, a risk factor for suicide. Varying amounts of environmental stress increase the probability that these individuals will develop that condition. Minority stress theory suggests that minority status leads to increased discrimination from the social environment which leads to greater stress and health problems. In the presence of poor emotion regulation skills this can lead to poor mental health. Also, the differential susceptibility hypothesis suggests that for some individuals their physical and mental development is highly dependent on their environment in a \\"for- better-and-for-worse\\" fashion. That is, individuals who are highly susceptible will have better than average health in highly supportive environments and significantly worse than average health in hostile, violent environments. The model can help explain the unique health problems affecting LGBT populations including increased suicide attempts. For adolescents, the most relevant environments are the family, neighborhood, and school. Adolescent bullying - which is highly prevalent among sexual minority youths - is a chronic stressor that can increase risk for suicide via the diathesis-stress model. In a study of American lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents, Mark Hatzenbuehler examined the effect of the county-level social environment. This was indexed by the proportion of same-sex couples and Democrats living in the counties. Also included were the proportions of schools with gay-straight alliances as well as anti-bullying and antidiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation. He found that a more conservative social environment elevated risk in suicidal behavior among all youth and that this effect was stronger for LGB youth. Furthermore, he found that the social environment partially mediated the relation between LGB status and suicidal behaviour. Hatzenbuehler found that even after such social as well as individual factors were controlled for, however, that \\"LGB status remained a significant predictor of suicide attempts.\\" Institutionalized and internalized homophobia Institutionalized and internalized homophobia may also lead LGBT youth to not accept themselves and have deep internal conflicts about their sexual orientation.Gibson, P. (1989), \\"Gay and Lesbian Youth Suicide\\", in Fenleib, Marcia R. (ed.), Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, United States Government Printing Office, Parents may abandon or force children out of home after the child's coming out. Homophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to bullying which can take many forms. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other verbal abuse. Cyber bullying involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media networks. Sexual bullying is inappropriate touching, lewd gestures or jokes. Bullying may be considered a \\"rite of passage\\", but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. \\"Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals\\", and \\"almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)\\") according to Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network's Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation‚Äôs Schools. Projects The Trevor Project The Trevor Project is an American non-profit organization founded in 1998 focused on suicide prevention efforts among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. Through a toll-free telephone number, it operates The Trevor Lifeline, a confidential service that offers trained counselors. The stated goals of the project are to provide crisis intervention and suicide prevention services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25, as well as to offer guidance and resources to parents and educators.About Trevor It Gets Better Project It Gets Better Project is an Internet-based campaign founded in the US by Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller in September 2010, in response to the suicides of teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or because their peers suspected that they were gay. The videos that were posted emphasized the idea that hope is possible despite the bullying that LGBT individuals may face. Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message through social media videos that these teens' lives will improve. The project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the It Gets Better Project, and includes more than 30,000 entries with more than 40 million views from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities. A book of essays from the project, It Gets Better: Coming Out, Overcoming Bullying, and Creating a Life Worth Living, was released in March 2011. President Barack Obama posted an \\"It Gets Better\\" video on The White House website as part of the It Gets Better Project. Policy responses A number of policy options have been repeatedly proposed to address this issue. Some advocate intervention at the stage in which youth are already suicidal (such as crisis hotlines), while others advocate programs directed at increasing LGBT youth access to factors found to be \\"protective\\" against suicide (such as social support networks or mentors). One proposed option is to provide LGBT-sensitivity and anti-bullying training to current middle and high school counselors and teachers. Citing a study by Jordan et al., school psychologist Anastasia Hansen notes that hearing teachers make homophobic remarks or fail to intervene when students make such remarks are both positively correlated with negative feelings about an LGBT identity Conversely, a number of researchers have found the presence of LGBT-supportive school staff to be related to \\"positive outcomes for LGBT youth\\". Citing a 2006 Psychology in the Schools report, The Trevor Project notes that \\"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) youth who believe they have just one school staff member with whom they can talk about problems are only 1/3 as likely as those without that support to... report making multiple suicide attempts in the past year.\\" Another frequently proposed policy option involves providing grant incentives for schools to create and/or support Gay-Straight Alliances, student groups dedicated to providing a social support network for LGBT students. Kosciw and Diaz, researchers for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, found in a nationwide survey that \\"students in schools with a GSA were less likely to feel unsafe, less likely to miss school, and more likely to feel that they belonged at their school than students in schools with no such clubs.\\" Studies have shown that social isolation and marginalization at school are psychologically damaging to LGBT students, and that GSAs and other similar peer-support group can be effective providers of this \\"psychosocial support\\". Early interventions for LGBT youth Be proactive and understanding Educators can be proactive in helping adolescents with gender identity and the questions/issues that sometimes come with them. Nornalising education about sexualities and genders can help prevent adolescents from resorting to suicide, drug abuse, homelessness, and many more psychological problems. Van Wormer & McKinney (2003) relate that understanding LGBT students is the first step to suicide prevention. They use a harm reduction approach, which meets students where they are to reduce any continued harm linked with their behaviors. They relate that creating a supportive and culturally diverse environment is crucial to social acceptance in an educational setting. LGBT role models/resources It is beneficial to hire LGBT teachers to serve as role models and support LGBT students. Many of the resources in the U.S. are crisis-driven- not prevention-driven. In order to prevent suicide for LGBT adolescents, it needs to be the other way around. Furthermore, studies show that counselors and teachers need to be trained in self-awareness, sexuality and sexual diversity with themselves and with students. Researchers also suggest inviting gay/lesbian and bisexual panels from colleges or universities to conduct classroom discussions. Education and resources is key to helping LGBT students and families. According to researcher Rob Cover, role models and resources benefit LGBT youth only if they avoid replicating stereotypes and provide diverse visual and narrative representations to allow broad identification.Cover, Rob. (2012). Queer Youth Suicide, Culture and Identity: Unliveable Lives? Ashgate, Having a PFLAG (Parents Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) and GSA Club are possible resources to promote discussions and leadership roles to LGBT students. These resources extend outside of school and in the community. (Greytak, E. A., Kosciw, J. G., & Boesen, M. J. 2013) report that when schools have a GSA or Gay Straight Alliance club or a club promoting social awareness and camaraderie of sorts, supportive educators, inclusive curricula, and comprehensive policies that LGBT students were victimized less and had more positive school experiences. Students will feel positive and want to be in school. Teach tolerance and examine a school's climate Examine a school's climate and teach tolerance ‚Äì Teaching Tolerance is a movement, magazine and website which gives many tools and ideas to help people be tolerant of one another. It demonstrates that the classroom is a reflection of the world around us. Educators can use Teach Tolerance's website and book to download resources and look up creative ways to learn more about LGBT students and teaching tolerance to their students in the classroom. It helps schools get started with anti-bullying training and professional development and resource suggestions. It even relates common roadblocks and tips to starting a GSA club. Research shows that a collaborative effort must be made in order to prevent LGBT students from being bullied and/or committing suicide. Teachers, administrators, students, families, and communities need to come together to help LGBT students be confident. Each school has its own individuality, its own sense of \\"self\\", whether it be the teachers, administrators, students, or the surrounding community. In order to tackle the issue of bullying for LGBT students it needs to start with understanding the student population and demographic where the school lies. Educating students, faculty, staff, and school boards on LGBT issues and eliminating homophobia and trans phobia in schools, training staff on diversity acceptance and bullying prevention, and implementing Gay-Straight Alliances is key to suicide prevention for LGBT students (Bacon, Laura Ann 2011).Bacon, Laura Ann, \\"A Study of Effective Strategies, Programs, and Policies for School Leaders in Protecting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth from Peer Victimization\\" (2011). Electronic Theses & Dissertations. Paper 380. Adolescents grow and are shaped by many factors including internal and external features (Swearer, Espelage, Vaillancourt, & Hymel, 2010). The school climate must foster respect. Thus, setting the tone for administration, teachers, professionals who enter the building, parents and most importantly the students. People, in general, need to understand their own misconceptions and stereotypes of what being LGBT is. Unless students and adults are educated on the LGBT community, than stereotypes and negative attitudes will continue to exist (Knotts, G., & Gregorio, D. 2011). The GMCLA (Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles) use music and singing as a vehicle for changing the attitudes and hearts of people in schools nationwide. Their goal is to bring music to standards-driven curriculum to youth with the purpose of teaching content in innovative and meaningful ways. They instill in students and staff techniques to foster positive meaning of the social and personal issues dealt with in school and society. Gay, L. (2009) has generated a guide to helping school safety/climate and fostering positive interpersonal relationships through \\"The Safe Space Kit\\".Gay, L. (2009). The Safe Space Kit: Guide to Being an Ally to LGBT Students. Gay, Lesbian And Straight Education Network (GLSEN) This tool helps teachers create a safe space for LGBT students. One of the most effective ways for an educator to create a safe space is to be a supportive ally to LGBT students. This kit has numerous tools for teachers and schools to utilize, including: a hard copy of \\"The Safe Space Kit\\" includes the \\"Guide to Being an Ally\\", stickers and two Safe Space posters. Even utilizing something just to promote awareness, such as using \\"The Safe Space Kit\\" could be a good first step for schools to promote responsiveness to LGBT students. Providing some supports rather than none at all can benefit LGBT youth tremendously now and in the future (Greytak, et al. 2013). OBPP (Olweus Bullying Prevention Program) OBPP is an anti-bullying program designed by psychologist Dan Olweus utilized in schools in Europe, Canada and the U.S. Reductions in bullying were due to parent training, playground supervision, home-school communication, classroom rules, and training videos. Furthermore, Swearer, et al. (2010) discuss a \\"dosage effect\\" in which the more positive and consistent elements included in a program, the more the likelihood that bullying would decrease. Success in one school does not guarantee success in another because each school has its own social climate. The OBPP is effective but still needs to be analyzed further, since there are many things to consider when implementing this technique within a large school. Steps To Respect Steps To Respect is an anti-bullying campaign which can be beneficial in schools as well ‚Äì it is a comprehensive guide for teachers, administrators, and students utilizing in class lessons and training helping schools foster positive social-emotional skills and conflict resolution. If schools are able to change peer conduct and norms, increase student communication skills, and maintain adult prevention and intervention efforts, the positive effects of their work will strengthen over time (Frey, Edstrom & Hirschstein 2005)Steps to Respect (Frey, Edstrom and Hirschstein 2005; Frey et al. 2005; Hirschtein et al. 20070; category 6 and continue to grow as each class progresses through the school system. Make curriculum changes According to Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., Laub, C., & Manke, E. (2006),Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., Laub, C., & Manke, E. (2006). LGBT Student Safety: Steps Schools Can Take.(California Safe Schools Coalition Research Brief No. 3) San Francisco, CA: California Safe Schools Coalition it is imperative for educators to make subject and age appropriate lessons with LGBT issues incorporated into the curriculum on a consistent basis utilizing current events, history, literature, or social sciences. Teachers should be trained each year on new practices to employ in their classrooms and in school in general. They should be taught how to handle situations they may face with LGBT students, so that if a problem should arise, they will be confident in their own understandings of the LGBT community and know how to handle any question or situation professionally and empathetically. Russell, et al. (2006) report that state policy and government officials need to be mindful of the ever-changing culture we live in by enforcing and including material appropriate in schools to educate educators on LGBT people in the world. Burdge, H., Sinclair, K., Laub, C., Russell, S. T. (2012)Burdge, H., Sinclair, K., Laub, C., Russell, S. T. (2012). Lessons That Matter: LGBTQ Inclusivity and School Safety. (GayStraight Alliance Network and California Safe Schools Coalition Research Brief No. 14). San Francisco, CA: Gay-Straight Alliance Network. relate numerous lessons, which each subject area teacher can teach to enforce LGBT inclusivity and school safety. They report that lessons, which promote LGBT inclusivity, can have the greatest impact on school safety. Physical education, health, history, and social studies teachers can educate all students to have more social awareness and create a positive school climate. They continue to note that inviting parents, teachers, administrators and other key stakeholders to identify and/or participate in the development of age-appropriate LGBT-inclusive lessons that teachers can use in their classrooms is most beneficial. Educators must continue to try new trends, constantly assessing the environment of their school. The best policies and interventions are those, which show positive growth across grade levels. Research should continue to see which programs suit the needs of different schools over a period of time. Since each school varies in many ways, it may be hard to report positive trends. One technique that works in one school may or may not work for another. Therefore, taking pieces of one technique and making it into something that molds best to each school and environment is key.

The band released a pair of top 20 U.S. hit singles in 1965, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" and \\"Just a Little.\\" He later fronted another band, Stoneground, which produced three albums in the early 1970s. After reuniting on numerous occasions with the Beau Brummels, Valentino began a solo career, releasing his latest album, Every Now and Then, in 2008. Career Valentino grew up in the North Beach section of San Francisco. In 1964, he received an offer to play a regular gig at a local club. Needing a band, he called childhood friend and songwriter/guitarist Ron Elliott, who recruited drummer John Petersen, rhythm guitarist/singer Declan Mulligan, and bassist Ron Meagher. They called themselves \\"The Stepping Stones\\", and played the Longshoreman's Hall in S.F., which led to a more lucrative deal at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby San Mateo, California. There, the Beau Brummels were discovered by prominent San Francisco deejay Tom Donahue, who quickly signed the band to his label, Autumn Records. The band released \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" in December 1964 as their debut single. The song peaked at number fifteen in February 1965. \\"Just a Little\\", the follow-up single, fared even better on the charts, peaking at number eight. Valentino appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Valentino also appeared with the band as The Beau Brummelstones on the animated TV sitcom The Flintstones in the season six episode \\"Shinrock A Go- Go,\\" which originally aired on December 3, 1965. Although the Beau Brummels' subsequent releases were not as commercially successful as their debut album and its first two singles, the band earned underground credibility with 1967's Triangle and 1968's Bradley's Barn. Critics noted the works as early contributions to the country rock genre. The band, which by 1968 consisted of only Valentino and Elliott, split up, and following a stint recording singles for Warner Bros. Records, Valentino assembled a new band, Stoneground. After the group released three albums in the early 1970s, Valentino left the group in 1973. Disenchanted, he left the music business. For many years, he worked normal jobs, including forklift driver and warehouse stockman, finally ending up working as an agent in the Race Form at Northern California race tracks. In 1993, he herniated his back and was forced to go on disability. This was the first time in 15 years he thought of returning to music and singing again. He later participated in numerous Beau Brummels revivals over the next two decades. After a hiatus from music, Valentino contributed to a 2003 Bob Dylan tribute album, Positively 12th and K, with musician Jackie Greene. In 2006, Valentino released Dreamin' Man, the first solo album of his 45-year career. Another album, Come Out Tonight, followed later that year, and his third solo album, Every Now and Then, was released in 2008.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Set in \\"Hope, New Britannia\\", an overwrought nineteenth century New Zealand community seemingly on the edge of destruction, Dorothea Brooke (Ward-Lealand) is a shopkeeper and dress designer with a troubled past. She strives in vain to keep her feckless, opium-addicted sister Rose out of the clutches of her former lover, Fraser (Curtis). Dorothea is in a lesbian relationship with Anne Cooper (Chappell) but tempted by newcomer and former radical Lawrence Hayes (Smith). MP and war profiteer William Poyser (Hurst) wants her business and property to shore up his tottering career, through marriage. Dorothea, Anne and Lawrence become enmeshed in a tortured triangle, resolved when Lawrence agrees to marry Rose for convenience and to get her away from Fraser. Rose dies ravaged from her opium addiction, although Lawrence and Fraser have fought a battle on board a vessel as passengers and both are missing, presumed dead. Dorothea has been coerced into accepting Poyser in marriage. Two years pass and Fraser returns, as does Lawrence. At an opera, a mise-en-abyme version of Fraser's sudden death is replayed - but the veiled female assailant turns out to be Anne, not Dorothea. Realising that Anne is her true love, Dorothea leaves Poyser to his fate, given the exposure of his financial mismanagement and gambling debts. Lawrence sees them off at the dock as they depart Hope, and Dorothea and Anne are last seen together at the vessel's helm, embracing and arm in arm. Cast * Jennifer Ward-Lealand as Dorothea Brook * Kevin Smith as Lawrence Hayes * Lisa Chappell as Anne Cooper * Cliff Curtis as Fraser * Michael Hurst as Willam Poyser * Kiri Mills as Rose * Bridget Armstrong as Mary Anne * Timothy Raby as Mr. Weedle * Helen Steemson as Gnits * Geeling Ng as Su Lim (as Geeling Ching) Production The film was shot on a relatively modest budget of $2 million. As a money saving device it was mostly shot in a shed on the Auckland harbour. To further save on costs the cast members each played multiple roles. By utilising Fuji stock for its excessive colour the film was able to make the most of it costuming and art direction to create visuals that far exceeded what was to be expected from its budget. Release and reception Desperate Remedies premiered at the Miami Film Festival to wide acclaim. It appeared at many festivals including Cannes Film Festival, Kiev International Film Festival and the Turin Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. The film picked up many awards including Best Design and Best Film at Kiev and the Audience Prize in Turin. It was also well received in New Zealand, winning awards for Best Cinematography, Best Design and Best Costume Design at the 1994 New Zealand Film and Television Awards. The film also garnered critical acclaim in the US and United Kingdom with many high-profile publications giving it positive reviews. In the US The New York Times described the film as \\"gorgeous but silly\\" while the Los Angeles Times noted that \\"Wells and Main never stumble, and their film emerges as a glittery triumph\\". In the UK the film received glowing reviews from NME who described it as \\"gloriously overblown, shamelessly camp and utterly wonderful\\" while The Sunday Times reviewed it as \\"Deliciously Dotty\\".

Zero Hedge, per its motto, is bearish in its investment outlook and analysis, often deriving from its adherence to the Austrian School of economics and credit cycles. While often labeled as a financial permabear, Zero Hedge has also been described as a source of \\"cutting-edge news, rumors and gossip in the financial industry\\". Over time, Zero Hedge expanded into non-financial analysis, such as conspiracy theories and fringe rhetoric that has been associated with the US radical right and a pro-Russian bias. Zero Hedge's non-financial commentary has led to a number of by various global social media platforms, although its 2019 Facebook ban and 2020 Twitter ban were later reversed. Zero Hedge in-house content is posted under the pseudonym \\"Tyler Durden\\"; the founder and main editor was identified as Daniel Ivandjiiski.  History and authorship  Zero Hedge's first post appeared on 9 January 2009 at 4pm, and the domain was registered on 11 January 2009. According to the Boston Business Journal, the website \\"publishes financial news and opinion, aggregated and original\\" from a number of writers \\"who purportedly hail from within the financial industry.\\" Almost all in-house articles are signed under the collective pseudonym, \\"Tyler Durden\\", a character in the Chuck Palahniuk book and movie Fight Club. In September 2009, news reports identified Daniel Ivandjiiski, a Bulgarian-born, U.S.-educated, former hedge-fund trader, who was barred from the securities industry in September 2008 for earning US$780 from an insider trade by FINRA, as the founder of the site, and reported that \\"Tyler Durden\\" was a pseudonym for Ivandjiiski.Whitehouse, Kaja (2 September 2009). \\"Blogger May Have a Past\\", New York Post. Retrieved 12 May 2011 FINRA rulings show Ivandjiiski worked for 3 years at New York investment bank, Jefferies & Co., as well a number of hedge funds, the last of which was Wexford Capital LLC, a fund led by former Goldman Sachs traders. One female site contributor, who spoke to New York magazine in an interview arranged by Ivandjiiski, said \\"up to 40\\" people could post under the \\"Tyler Durden\\" pseudonym. The same New York magazine article, published on 27 September 2009, stated that Ivandjiiski's father was Krassimir Ivandjiiski, a Bulgarian publisher and editor of the website Strogo Sekretno (\\"Top Secret\\"), and monthly publication Bulgarian Confidential, since 1994. In a 29 April 2016 Bloomberg article \\"unmasking\\" Zero Hedge, the authors writing as \\"Tyler Durden\\" were revealed as Ivandjiiski, then age 37, Tim Backshall, age 45 (a credit derivatives strategist), and Colin Lokey, age 32 (a Seeking Alpha staff writer). Lokey, the newest member, who joined in 2015, publicly revealed himself and the other two, when he left the site in April 2016. Ivandjiiski confirmed the three men \\"had been the only Tyler Durdens on the payroll\\" since Lokey joined in 2015. Lokey said he was paid $6,000 per month, and received a bonus of $50,000, earning over $100,000 in 2015. According to Ivandjiiski, the blog generates revenue from online advertising (there is no subscription service). In March 2020, Bulgarian litigation between Krassimir Ivandjiiski and U.S. journalist Seth Hettena revealed further details about the Ivandjiiski family and the site's ownership. Site bans On 12 March 2019, Bloomberg reported that Facebook had banned users from sharing Zero Hedge posts three days earlier. MarketWatch, noting that Zero Hedge is a \\"frequent critic of Facebook\\", reported that the ban was lifted later that day with Facebook saying that the ban was a \\"mistake with our automation to detect spam\\". Business Insider, describing Zero Hedge as \\"a favorite of City and Wall Street traders, known for its anti-establishment and bearish slant on financial topics\\", noted that Donald Trump Jr. and Nigel Farage raised objections to Facebook's censure of Zero Hedge. Australian telecom company Telstra temporarily denied access to Zero Hedge and other websites on 20 March 2019 as a result of the Christchurch mosque shootings. On 20 January 2020, Zero Hedge's Twitter account, which then had 670,000 followers, was \\"permanently suspended\\" from Twitter for violating their platform manipulation policy. Bloomberg reported that Zero Hedge had been informed by Twitter that the suspension was as a result of an article titled: \\"Is This The Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?\\", in which they doxed a Chinese virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On 12 June 2020, Twitter reinstated the account after an appeal from Zero Hedge and stated that the suspension was an error. Zero Hedge was banned from the Google Ads platform on 17 June 2020. An email from Google to NBC said that Zero Hedge violated Google's content policy that \\"explicitly prohibit[s] derogatory content that promotes hatred, intolerance, violence or discrimination based on race from monetizing.\\" The violating comments were found on stories related to George Floyd protests. Google lifted the ban in July 2020, after the management of Zero Hedge began moderating comments. Zero Hedge revealed on June 17, 2020 that PayPal had, like Google, deplatformed the site, and they would only be able to accept cryptocurrency payments in the future. Manifesto and views At its creation in January 2009, Zero Hedge published a manifesto on the objectives of the site. Financial views Recreation of a typical Zero Hedge chart from BIS data of G3 central bank balance sheets: FEB, ECB and BOJ Recreation of a typical Zero Hedge chart from BIS and Bloomberg, showing the G3 central bank balance sheets: FEB, ECB and the BOJ versus the share price of Amazon (AMZN) Recreation of a typical Zero Hedge chart from BIS and Bloomberg, showing the G3 central bank balance sheets: FEB, ECB and the BOJ versus the MSCI U.S. Stock Market The most strongly held belief by Zero Hedge is in Austrian economics, and that economic cycles are really credit cycles, and that the quantitative easing (\\"QE\\") by global central banks is a temporary and artificial asset-price support scheme, that makes the credit cycle even more extreme; and hence the site's strongly bearish views. As a result of this view, Zero Hedge supports assets that are outside of the central banking system, including precious metals and gold, and even cryptocurrencies. The site is strongly against Keynesian economics, and sees quantitative easing as a Keynesian \\"money printing trick\\", and vilifies advocates of this approach, such as Paul Krugman in particular. The site praises writers with similar views, such Albert Edwards and John Hussman. Critics of Zero Hedge label the site a \\"permabear\\", whose views missed the global recovery since 2013. Zero Hedge responds that the since 2013, global central banks have undertaken a continuous program of quantitative easing (\\"QE\\") (e.g. aggregate monthly easing has rarely dropped below the level of QE1 or QE2, see graphic opposite), and when QE1 and QE2 ended, markets collapsed. The site references Japan, whose market set new lows after each round of QE, from 1994‚Äì2013, and where the latest round of QE, started in 2013, has seen the BOJ become a dominant owner of the Nikkei 225. Zero Hedge maintains a number of financial views/theories which are considered conspiratorial, and/or hard-to-prove or unprovable; notable views include: A connected theme from the above views is that central banks have nationalized capital markets, that prices are artificial and do not reflect economic theory, that U.S. financial institutions have profited from this, and that the manipulation of asset prices has driven wealth inequality in society and built up financial risks (due to the leverage against these prices). Zero Hedge often shows the chart of G3 balance sheets versus Amazon's share price (see graphic), concluding that U.S. taxpayer's money has been used by the U.S. FED to make U.S. taxpayers unemployed. Bearish macroeconomic views and conspiracy theories aside, Zero Hedge is noted as a source of detailed, but proprietary, research from Wall Street investment banks and institutions, on securities, which can be picked up by the financial media. Sometimes, the research is about other investment banks. It has also been a source of breaking news in the general capital markets industry. In Zero Hedge's early years, it was associated with exposing the unknown world of High-frequency trading (\\"HFT\\"), and the HFT techniques that Zero Hedge claimed amounted to market manipulation. Zero Hedge is known for personalized attacks on specific finance professionals, examples being newsletter writer and commodity analyst Dennis Gartman (over 758 articles), Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman (over 703 articles), and fund manager Whitney Tilson (over 325 articles), amongst others. Non- financial views While Zero Hedge's financial content is often referred to/quoted in the mainstream financial media (see above), its non-financial content has not been relied on by mainstream media. The 29 April 2016 unmasking article by Bloomberg, quoted former website staffer Colin Lokey as saying: \\"I can't be a 24-hour cheerleader for Hezbollah, Moscow, Tehran, Beijing, and Trump anymore. It's wrong. Period. I know it gets you views now, but it will kill your brand over the long run. This isn't a revolution. It's a joke.\\" Lokey told Bloomberg that he was pressured to frame issues in a way he felt was \\"disingenuous,\\" summarizing its political stances as \\"Russia=good. Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry=dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft.\\" Lokey provided chat transcripts in which Ivandjiiski refers to America‚Äôs \\"silent majority\\" as \\"beastly\\", while Backshall acknowledges life in the U.S. is bad \\"outside of my bubble\\". Wallace-Wells noted that the site demonstrated a pro-Russian bias, stating the site had a \\"pointed\\" Russophilia. In a series of articles in June‚ÄìJuly 2017, the Financial Times, covering an event organised by one of the site's bloggers, said that, \\"It probably didn't help that ZeroHedge was also used as a lead-in for a 2016 New Yorker piece about the alt-right, despite its financial focus and a political bent that is more Drudge than Richard Spencer.\\" In January 2020, when the site was removed from Twitter, BuzzFeed News described Zero Hedge as \\"pro-Trump\\" and \\"far-right\\", while reporting on the removal, The Washington Post said that Zero Hedge \\"In recent years, the blog has amplified right-wing conspiracy theories on a range of topics\\". In March 2020, American journalist Seth Hettena wrote an opinion-piece in The New Republic titled \\"Is Zero Hedge a Russian Trojan Horse?\\", and provided details on the links between Krassimir Ivandjiiski (the site publisher's Bulgarian father), and Soviet-era activities in propaganda, revealed during litigation initiated by the father against Hettena in the Bulgarian courts. Hettena commented that Zero Hedge has become \\"a forum for the hateful, conspiracy- driven voices of the angry white men of the alt-right. Racists, anti-Semites, extreme right-wingers, and conspiracy nuts were an underserved audience, and, as it turns out, a profitable one.\\" Critical reception Launch to 2014 In August 2009, under the pseudonym Tyler Durden, Ivandjiiski was interviewed on Bloomberg Radio on HFT.Tim Fox, Interview with \\"Tyler Durden\\" on Taking Stock (MP3) Bloomberg Radio. (20 August 2009). Retrieved 4 December 2011 By September 2009, Zero Hedge had begun drawing more traffic than some established financial blogs, and Quantcast reported that the blog was getting 333,000 unique visitors a month (by 2018, it would be 40 million per month). In September 2009, journalist Joe Hagan wrote that Zero Hedge's founder was \\"a zealous believer in a sweeping conspiracy that casts the alumni of Goldman Sachs as a powerful cabal at the helm of U.S. policy.\\" In September and October 2009, Financial journalists Felix Salmon and Justin Fox characterized the site as conspiratorial. However, Justin Fox, went on to describe Ivandjiiski as \\"a wonderfully persistent investigative reporter\\" and credited him for successfully turning high-frequency trading \\"into a big political issue,\\" but also termed most of the writing on the website as \\"half-baked hooey,\\" albeit with some \\"truth to be gleaned from it.\\" In his book, Griftopia (2010), Matt Taibbi cited Zero Hedge as having accurately assessed the level of corruption in the banking industry.Taibbi, Matt, Griftopia, New York: Spiegel & Grau (2010), p. 208 In January 2011, Zero Hedge was quoted in the Columbia Journalism Review regarding a JPMorgan-Ambac lawsuit: \\"JPM committed fraud through misrepresentation, then wilfully and maliciously traded against the entities it had sold misrepresented securities to.\\"Ryan Chittum, Insurer Alleges Fraud by Bear Stearns and JPMorgan, Columbia Journalism Review (25 January 2011). In March 2011, Time magazine ranked Zero Hedge as 9th, in its 25 Best Financial Blogs, with nominator, Bloombergs Paul Kedrosky, stating that \\"So while I don't read Zero Hedge regularly‚Äîit's too bearish, too conspiratorial and too much of an intellectual monoculture‚ÄîI like knowing that it exists. Any time I'm feeling like things might just turn out O.K. on planet Economic Earth, I know where to turn to be disabused of that stupid idea.\\" Susanne Craig of The New York Times described Zero Hedge in October 2011 as \\"a well-read and controversial financial blog.\\"Craig, Susanne (4 October 2011). \\"Morgan Tries to Quell Rumors About Its Holdings\\", The New York Times. In December 2012, Bank of America, which had been criticized by the site in the past, blocked its employees' access to Zero Hedge from BOA servers. 2014 to 2018 In September 2014, the site was described by CNN Money as offering a \\"deeply conspiratorial, anti-establishment and pessimistic view of the world.\\" In November 2014, Dr. Craig Pirrong, Professor of Finance at the University of Houston, stated: \\"I have frequently written that Zero Hedge has the MO of a Soviet agitprop operation, that it reliably peddles Russian propaganda: my first post on this, almost exactly three years ago, noted the parallels between Zero Hedge and Russia Today.\\"Pirrong, Craig. How Do You Know That Zero Hedge is a Russian Information Operation? Here‚Äôs How, Streetwise Professor (20 November 2014)Pirrong, Craig. Peas in a Pod: Occupy, RT, and Zero Hedge, Streetwise Professor (7 November 2011) In December 2013, Zero Hedge accused Dr. Pirrong of being a \\"paid-for-Professor\\", who had \\"made a living of collecting \\"expert academic\\" fees by simply signing off on [wall street] memoranda\\", quoting a New York Times expose by David Kocieniewski into Dr. Pirrong. In September 2015, Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman described Zero Hedge as a scaremongering outlet that promotes fears of hyperinflation and an \\"obviously ridiculous\\" form of \\"monetary permahawkery.\\"Krugman, Paul (21 September 2015). \\"Nutcases and Knut Cases\\", The New York Times. In November 2012, Krugman had noted that Bill McBride of Calculated Risk, an economics blog, has treated Zero Hedge with \\"appropriate contempt\\".Krugman, Paul (21 November 2012). \\"All Hail Calculated Risk\\", The New York Times. Krugman has been one of the most vilified individuals on Zero Hedge, and the subject of over 703 articles (almost all negative) since inception, due to Krugman's advocacy of Keynesian economics. In April 2016, as part of its expose from the Colin Lokey interview, Unmasking the Men Behind Zero Hedge, Wall Street's Renegade Blog, Bloomberg Markets stated that since its founding in the middle of the financial crisis, \\"Zero Hedge has grown from a blog to an Internet powerhouse. Often distrustful of the 'establishment' and almost always bearish, it's known for a pessimistic worldview. Posts entitled 'Stocks Are In a Far More Precarious State Than Was Ever Truly Believed Possible' and 'America's Entitled (And Doomed) Upper Middle Class' are not uncommon.\\" In a May 2016 follow-up Bloomberg opinion piece, Noah Smith said: \\"Zero Hedge has become known as a source of cutting- edge news, rumors and gossip about the financial industry, as well as a haven for gold bugs, foes of the Federal Reserve and critics of high-frequency trading\\"; and also that: \\"But I've realized that the website is also something else‚Äîa kind of support group for financial industry workers who are worried about their own economic future in the face of sweeping changes in technology, regulation and demand\\". Post‚Äì2018 On 20 November 2019, NBC News reported Zero Hedge as the initial source of a \\"misleading claim about the head of the Ukrainian energy company at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry\\", which went viral during the impeachment hearings. NBC said that \\"ZeroHedge apparently misconstrued the original Russian article from the Interfax-Ukraine News Agency, which did not mention an indictment. The Interfax-Ukraine News Agency operates as part of Interfax, a Russian news outlet\\". In January 2020, after Zero Hedge had been removed from Twitter, Business Insider reported that \\"In the years after the financial crash, the site had a bonafide social presence and a solidified place among financial insiders\\", and that \\"Since its rise to popularity among Wall Street insiders, Zero Hedge has since become known for sensationalist headlines and gruff take on the world's news\\". Reporting on the affair, the Washington Post said that, \\"Zero Hedge launched in 2009, mostly featuring news and commentary about financial markets from a libertarian perspective. In recent years, the blog has amplified right-wing conspiracy theories on a range of topics\\". Litigation GEROVA Financial On 27 March 2012, Daniel Ivandjiiski was named as a co- conspirator in a civil complaint regarding a \\"complaint for damages and equitable relief\\". The complainant, Noble Investments, who described themselves as a seed-investor in GEROVA Financial Group (NYSE: GFC), alleged that Dalrymple Finance had, with Zero Hedge and others, engaged in a short and distort stock manipulation scheme, by publishing negative reports on GEROVA in January 2011. The complaint stated that, amongst other charges, the defendants made damaging accusations that major shareholders, the Galanis family, and GEROVA senior executives, were involved in a \\"pump and dump\\" scheme; it also made ad hominem attacks on both Daniel Ivandjiiski, and his then alleged father, Krassimir Ivandjiiski. Dalrymple replied: \\"Writing research on quoted companies and distributing that research to financial media outlets, is neither illegal and is a daily legitimate activity on Wall Street\\". The complaint did not progress and there was no SEC investigation. GEROVA Financial's share collapsed in 2011, and never recovered. On 24 September 2015, the SEC charged a number of senior GEROVA executives and a few major investors in GEROVA with a \\"stock fraud scheme\\", for which several, including the former company Chairman and President, Gary Hirst, received jail sentences in 2017.

Multiculturalism is a particular subject of debate in certain European nations that are associated with the idea of a nation state. Critics of multiculturalism may argue against cultural integration of different ethnic and cultural groups to the existing laws and values of the country. Alternatively critics may argue for assimilation of different ethnic and cultural groups to a single national identity. Australia Rifts within Australian society, right through history, whether between the continent's Indigenous people and the European settler population or, in recent times, inter-ethnic tension manifest in the form of riots, street violence and ethnic gangs pose major challenges to multiculturalism in the country. The response to multiculturalism in Australia has been varied. A nationalist, anti-mass immigration party, the One Nation Party, was formed by Pauline Hanson in the late 1990s. The party enjoyed brief electoral success, most notably in its home state of Queensland, but became electorally marginalized until its resurgence in 2016. In the late 1990s, One Nation called for the abolition of multiculturalism alleging that it represented \\"a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values\\", arguing that there was \\"no reason why migrant cultures should be maintained at the expense of our shared, national culture.\\" An Australian Federal Government proposal in 2006 to introduce a compulsory citizenship test, which would assess English skills and knowledge of Australian values, sparked renewed debate over the future of multiculturalism in Australia. Andrew Robb, then Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, told a conference in November 2006 that some Australians worried the term \\"multicultural\\" had been transformed by interest groups into a philosophy that put \\"allegiances to original culture ahead of national loyalty, a philosophy which fosters separate development, a federation of ethnic cultures, not one community\\". He added: \\"A community of separate cultures fosters a rights mentality, rather than a responsibilities mentality. It is divisive. It works against quick and effective integration.\\"The Courier Mail: National identity in spotlight, 28 November 2006 . The Australian citizenship test commenced in October 2007 for all new citizens between the ages of 18 and 60. In January 2007 the Howard Government removed the word \\"multicultural\\" from the name of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, changing its name to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Intellectual critique The earliest academic critics of multiculturalism in Australia were the philosophers Lachlan ChipmanLachlan Chipman (1980), 'The Menace of Multiculturalism,' in Quadrant, Vol. 24, No. 10, October, pp. 3‚Äì6 and Frank Knopfelmacher,Frank Knopfelmacher (1982), 'The case against multi- culturalism,' in Robert Manne (ed.), The New Conservatism in Australia, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 40‚Äì66 sociologist Tanya BirrellTanya Birrell (1978), 'Migration and the Dilemmas of Multiculturalism,' in Robert Birrell and Colin Hay (eds.), The Immigration Issue in Australia, A Sociological Symposium, Department of Sociology, School of Social Sciences, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, pp. 132‚Äì46 and the political scientist Raymond Sestito.Raymond Sestito (1982), The Politics of Multiculturalism, The Centre for Independent Studies, Sydney, New South Wales () Chipman and Knopfelmacher were concerned with threats to social cohesion, while Birrell's concern was that multiculturalism obscures the social costs associated with large scale immigration that fall most heavily on the most recently arrived and unskilled immigrants. Sestito's arguments were based on the role of political parties. He argued that political parties were instrumental in pursuing multicultural policies, and that these policies would put strain on the political system and would not promote better understanding in the Australian community.Sestito (1982), pp. 30‚Äì36Lyle Allan (1983), 'A Selective Annotated Bibliography of Multiculturalism', in Social Alternatives (University of Queensland), Vol.3, No.3, July, p. 68 It was the high-profile historian Geoffrey Blainey, however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \\"cluster of tribes\\". In his 1984 book All for Australia, Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \\"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\\" and also for tending to be \\"anti-British\\", even though \\"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\\" According to Blainey, such a policy, with its \\"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \\"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\\" and warned that \\"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\\"Blainey, G. (1984). All For Australia, North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes () In one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote: > For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, > multiculturalism is almost an insult.

Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \\"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\\". The late historian John Hirst was another intellectual critic of multiculturalism.John Hirst, Sense and Nonsense in Australian History, Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne () He has argued that while multiculturalism might serve the needs of ethnic politics and the demands of certain ethnic groups for government funding for the promotion of their separate ethnic identity, it was a perilous concept on which to base national policy.John Hirst, Sense and Nonsense in Australian History, Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne (), p. 22 Critics associated with the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University have argued that both Right and Left factions in the Australian Labor Party have adopted a multicultural stance for the purposes of increasing their support within the party.Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches ‚Äì The Balkanisation of Labor,' in People and Place. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp 37‚Äì43 A manifestation of this embrace of multiculturalism has been the creation of ethnic branches within the Labor Party and ethnic branch stacking.Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches ‚Äì The Balkanisation of Labor,' in People and Place. Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 37 Following the upsurge of support for the One Nation Party in 1996, Lebanese-born Australian anthropologist Ghassan Hage published a critique in 1997 of Australian multiculturalism in the book White Nation.\\"Hage, G. (1997) White Nation: Fantasies of White Supremacy in a Multicultural Society, Annandale, NSW: Pluto Press ()\\" Canada Chinatown is an ethnic enclave located in the city centre Many Qu√©b√©cois, despite an official national bilingualism policy, insist that multiculturalism threatens to reduce them to just another ethnic group. Quebec's policy seeks to promote interculturalism, welcoming people of all origins while insisting that they integrate into Quebec's majority French-speaking society. In 2008, a Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences, headed by sociologist Gerard Bouchard and philosopher Charles Taylor, recognized that Quebec is a de facto pluralist society, but that the Canadian multiculturalism model \\"does not appear well suited to conditions in Quebec\\". According to a study conducted by The University of Victoria, many Canadians do not feel a strong sense of belonging in Canada, or cannot integrate themselves into society as a result of ethnic enclaves. Many immigrants to Canada choose to live in ethnic enclaves because it can be much easier than fitting in with mainstream Canadian culture. Foreign born Canadian, Neil Bissoondath in his book Selling Illusions: The Cult of Multiculturalism in Canada, argues that official multiculturalism limits the freedom of minority members, by confining them to cultural and geographic ethnic enclaves. He also argues that cultures are very complex, and must be transmitted through close family and kin relations. To him, the government view of cultures as being about festivals and cuisine is a crude oversimplification that leads to easy stereotyping. Canadian Daniel Stoffman's book Who Gets In questions the policy of Canadian multiculturalism. Stoffman points out that many cultural practices, such as allowing dog meat to be served in restaurants and street cockfighting, are simply incompatible with Canadian and Western culture. He also raises concern about the number of recent immigrants who are not being linguistically integrated into Canada (i.e., not learning either English or French). He stresses that multiculturalism works better in theory than in practice and Canadians need to be far more assertive about valuing the \\"national identity of English-speaking Canada\\". Germany Criticisms of parallel societies established by some immigrant communities increasingly came to the fore in the German public discourse during the 1990s, giving rise to the concept of the Leitkultur (\\"lead culture\\"). In October 2010, amid a nationwide controversy about Thilo Sarrazin's bestselling book Deutschland schafft sich ab (\\"Germany is abolishing Itself\\"), chancellor Angela Merkel of the conservative Christian Democratic Union judged attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany to have \\"failed, utterly failed\\".Matthew Weaver, Angela Merkel: German multiculturalism has 'utterly failed', The Guardian 17 October 2010, retrieved 19 September 2012 She added: \\"The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work\\". She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on the country and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society. According to one poll around the time, one-third of Germans believed the country was \\"overrun by foreigners\\". Italy Italy has recently seen a substantial rise in immigration and an influx of African immigrants. Many intellectuals have opposed multiculturalism among those: Ida Magli, professor emeritus of cultural anthropology at the University of Rome. She was a contributor to the weekly L'Espresso and was a columnist for the daily La Repubblica. She expressed criticism of multicultural societies. Oriana Fallaci was an Italian journalist, author, and political interviewer. A partisan during World War II, she had a long and successful journalistic career. Fallaci became famous worldwide for her coverage of war and revolution, and her interviews with many world leaders during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. After retirement, she returned to the spotlight after writing a series of controversial articles and books critical of Islam and immigration. Japan Japanese society, with its homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the Ainu and Ryukyuans. Former Japanese Prime Minister (Deputy Prime Minister as of 26 December 2012) Taro Aso has called Japan a \\"one race\\" nation. Malaysia Malaysia is a multicultural society with a Muslim Malay majority and substantial Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian minorities. Criticisms of multiculturalism have been periodically sparked by the entrenched constitutional position the Malay ethnicity enjoys through, inter alia, the Malaysian social contract. Contrary to other countries, in Malaysia affirmative action are often tailored to the needs of the Malay majority population.Multiculturalism at Risk. The Indian Minority in Malaysia, Economic and Political Weekly, September 2006, retrieved 24 September 2012 In 2006, the forced removal of Hindu temples across the country has led to accusations of \\"an unofficial policy of Hindu temple-cleansing in Malaysia\\". Netherlands Legal philosopher Paul Cliteur attacked multiculturalism in his book The Philosophy of Human Rights.Paul Cliteur. De filosofie van mensenrechten. Nijmegen 1999. Cliteur rejects all political correctness on the issue: Western culture, the Rechtsstaat (rule of law), and human rights are superior to non- Western culture and values. They are the product of the Enlightenment. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of cultural relativism, which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists infanticide, torture, slavery, oppression of women, homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, gangs, female genital cutting, discrimination by immigrants, suttee, and the death penalty. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of Auschwitz, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot and the Ku Klux Klan. In 2000, Paul Scheffer‚Äîa member of the Labour Party and subsequently a professor of urban studies‚Äîpublished his essay \\"The multicultural tragedy\\",Online at NRC, see . An English translation is available at an essay critical of both immigration and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the nation-state, assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite \\"absorptive capacity\\" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. He specifically cites failure to assimilate, spontaneous ethnic segregation, adaptation problems such as school drop-out, unemployment, and high crime rates (see immigration and crime), and opposition to secularism among Muslim immigrants as the main problems resulting from immigration. United Kingdom With considerable immigration after the Second World War making the UK an increasingly ethnically and racially diverse state, race relations policies have been developed that broadly reflect the principles of multiculturalism, although there is no official national commitment to the concept. This model has faced criticism on the grounds that it has failed to sufficiently promote social integration, although some commentators have questioned the dichotomy between diversity and integration that this critique presumes. It has been argued that the UK government has since 2001, moved away from policy characterised by multiculturalism and towards the assimilation of minority communities. Opposition has grown to state sponsored multicultural policies, with some believing that it has been a costly failure. Critics of the policy come from many parts of British society. There is now a debate in the UK over whether explicit multiculturalism and \\"social cohesion and inclusion\\" are in fact mutually exclusive. In the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings David Davis, the opposition Conservative shadow home secretary, called on the government to scrap its \\"outdated\\" policy of multiculturalism. The British columnist Leo McKinstry has persistently criticized multiculturalism, stating that \\"Britain is now governed by a suicide cult bent on wiping out any last vestige of nationhood\\" and called multiculturalism a \\"profoundly disturbing social experiment\\". McKinstry also wrote: > We are paying a terrible price for the creed of Left-wing politicians. They > pose as champions of progress yet their fixation with multiculturalism is > dragging us into a new dark age. In many of our cities, social solidarity is > being replaced by divisive tribalism, democracy by identity politics. Real > integration is impossible when ethnic groups are encouraged to cling to > customs, practices, even languages from their homeland. Trevor Phillips, the head of the Commission for Racial Equality, who has called for an official end to multicultural policy, has criticised \\"politically correct liberals for their \\"misguided\\" pandering to the ethnic lobby\\". Journalist Ed West argued in his 2013 book, The Diversity Illusion, that the British political establishment had uncritically embraced multiculturalism without proper consideration of the downsides of ethnic diversity. He wrote: > Everyone in a position of power held the same opinion. Diversity was a good > in itself, so making Britain truly diverse would enrich it and bring > 'significant cultural contributions', reflecting a widespread belief among > the ruling classes that multiculturalism and cultural, racial and religious > diversity were morally positive things whatever the consequences. This is > the unthinking assumption held by almost the entire political, media and > education establishment. It is the diversity illusion.West, Ed (2013). The > Diversity Illusion: What We Got Wrong About Immigration & How to Set it > Right, Gibson Square Books Ltd () West has also argued: > Advocates of multiculturalism argue that immigrants prefer to stick together > because of racism and the fear of racial violence, as well as the bonds of > community. This is perfectly reasonable, but if this is the case, why not > the same for natives too?

If people categorised as \\"white Britons\\" are not afforded > that indulgence because they are a majority, do they attain it when they > become a minority? In the May 2004 edition of Prospect Magazine, the editor David Goodhart temporarily couched the debate on multiculturalism in terms of whether a modern welfare state and a \\"good society\\" is sustainable as its citizens become increasingly diverse. In November 2005 John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, stated, \\"Multiculturalism has seemed to imply, wrongly for me: let other cultures be allowed to express themselves but do not let the majority culture at all tell us its glories, its struggles, its joys, its pains.\\" The Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali was also critical, calling for the Church to regain a prominent position in public life and blaming the \\"newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism\\" for entrenching the segregation of communities.Michael Nazir-Ali \\"Breaking Faith With Britain\\" , Standpoint, June 2008. Whilst minority cultures are allowed to remain distinct, British culture and traditions are sometimes perceived as exclusive and adapted accordingly, often without the consent of the local population. For instance, Birmingham City Council was heavily criticised when it was alleged to have renamed Christmas as \\"Winterval\\" in 1998, although in truth it had done no such thing. In August 2006, the community and local government secretary Ruth Kelly made a speech perceived as signalling the end of multiculturalism as official policy.\\"Ruth Kelly's speech on integration and cohesion\\", Guardian, 24 August 2006. In November 2006, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that Britain has certain \\"essential values\\" and that these are a \\"duty\\". He did not reject multiculturalism outright, but he included British heritage among the essential values:\\"Conform to our society, says PM\\", BBC News, 8 December 2006. > When it comes to our essential values‚Äîbelief in democracy, the rule of law, > tolerance, equal treatment for all, respect for this country and its shared > heritage‚Äîthen that is where we come together, it is what we hold in common. United States The U.S. Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans, especially Italians and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. In the 1980s and 1990s many criticisms were expressed, from both the left and right. Criticisms come from a wide variety of perspectives, but predominantly from the perspective of liberal individualism, from American conservatives concerned about shared traditional values, and from a national unity perspective. A prominent criticism in the US, later echoed in Europe, Canada and Australia, was that multiculturalism undermined national unity, hindered social integration and cultural assimilation, and led to the fragmentation of society into several ethnic factions (Balkanization). In 1991, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a former advisor to the Kennedy and other US administrations and Pulitzer Prize winner, published a book critical of multiculturalism with the title The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society. In his 1991 work, Illiberal Education, Dinesh D'Souza argues that the entrenchment of multiculturalism in American universities undermined the universalist values that liberal education once attempted to foster. In particular, he was disturbed by the growth of ethnic studies programs (e.g., black studies). The late Samuel P. Huntington, political scientist and author, known for his Clash of Civilizations theory, described multiculturalism as \\"basically an anti-Western ideology.\\" According to Huntington, multiculturalism had \\"attacked the identification of the United States with Western civilization, denied the existence of a common American culture, and promoted racial, ethnic, and other subnational cultural identities and groupings.\\"Huntington, Samuel P., The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, New York, Simon & Schuster, 1996 Huntington outlined the risks he associated with multiculturalism in his 2004 book Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity. Diversity and social trust Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study on how diversity affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities \\"don't trust the local mayor, they don't trust the local paper, they don't trust other people and they don't trust institutions,\\" writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that > [W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than > had been imagined. And it's not just that we don't trust people who are not > like us. In diverse communities, we don't trust people who do look like us. Multiculturalism and Islam In an article in the Hudson Review, Bruce Bawer writes about what he sees as a developing distaste toward the idea and policies of multiculturalism in Europe, especially, as stated earlier, in the Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Austria and Germany. The belief behind this backlash on multiculturalism is that it creates friction within society.\\"Crisis in Europe \\" See also * Ethnic penalty * Immigrant criminality * Immigration reduction * National assimilation (a.k.a. cultural assimilation) * Divide and rule Assimilation * Race traitor * Criticism of Islam * Criticism of Islamism * Undercover Mosque * Stop Islamisation of Europe * English Defence League * Londonistan: How Britain is Creating a Terror State Within * Eurabia References Further reading * Allan, Lyle (1983), 'A Selective Annotated Bibliography of Multiculturalism', in Social Alternatives (University of Queensland), Vol.3, No.3, July, pp. 65‚Äì72. * Blainey, Geoffrey (1984), All For Australia, Methuen Haynes, North Ryde, New South Wales. * Clancy, Greg (2006), The Conspiracies of Multiculturalism, Sunda Publications, Gordon, New South Wales. * Hirst, John (2005), Sense and Nonsense in Australian History, Black Inc.

Described by only a few ancient sources, no archaeological remains of the citadel have been found and much about it remains a matter of conjecture.  Persian origins?  After the conquest of Babylon by the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return to their native land and rebuild Jerusalem, sacked by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC. While rebuilding the city's fortifications, the Persian administration also constructed a new citadel north of the Temple Mount enclosure, as part of a general Persian effort to bolster the empire's defences.Carter, C. E. 1999. The Emergence of Yehud in the Persian Period. Sheffield Academic Press. This citadel is the Biryah (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ô◊®◊î) referred to in , appearing as the Baris in Greek translations of the Septuagint. The origin of the word is not entirely clear, but may have been borrowed into Hebrew from Assyrian birtu or bistu meaning a citadel or castle within a city, or a fort located at a strategic position outside a city. It may also derive from the Old Persian baru, meaning 'fort'.Wightman G. J. 1991. Temple Fortresses in Jerusalem Part II: The Hasmonean Baris and Herodian Antonia. Bulletin of the Anglo-Israeli Archaeological Society 10, pp. 7‚Äì35. Jerusalem was taken by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, in between his siege of Tyre and the conquest of Egypt. Jerusalem, however, was taken without a fight, and no account mentions the Persian citadel at this time. It may have been dismantled in the two centuries since its construction, but may have also fallen into Macedonian hands intact.  Hellenistic rule  In the Wars of the Diadochi following Alexander's death, Coele-Syria initially came under the rule of Antigonus Monophthalmus. In 301 BC Ptolemy I Soter, who four years earlier had crowned himself King of Egypt, exploited events surrounding the Battle of Ipsus to take control of the region. Coele-Syria, however, had been allocated to Ptolemy's former ally Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Empire. Seleucus, who had been aided by Ptolemy during his ascent to power, did not take any military action to reclaim the region. Once both were dead, however, their successors became embroiled in the Syrian Wars. In 200 BC, during the Fifth Syrian War, Antiochus III defeated the Ptolemaic army at the Battle of Panium, bringing an end to Ptolemaic control of Judea. According to Josephus, the Egyptian garrison still held out at the city's citadel when the Seleucid army arrived at Jerusalem. Aided by the local Jewish population, Antiochus besieged the fort and brought about it capitulation. Grateful for their assistance, Antiochus published a decree granting the Jews religious freedoms. As this decree also mentions the city's citadel,Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XII: 133, 138.Grabbe, L. L. 2008. A History of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period. Volume 2 ‚Äì The Coming of the Greeks: The Early Hellenistic Period (335 ‚Äì 175 BCE). T & T Clark, London. it was apparently still standing after the Seleucid conquest of Jerusalem.  Letter of Aristeas  The most detailed account of the Ptolemaic citadel is to be found in the Letter of Aristeas, an account of the translation into Greek of the Septuagint. In one section, the author, supposedly an Alexandrian Jew in the service of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309 BC ‚Äì 246 BC), visits the Temple Mount and is then invited to visit the Baris as well: > But in order that we might gain complete information, we ascended to the > summit of the neighbouring citadel and looked around us. It is situated in a > very lofty spot, and is fortified with many towers, which have been built up > to the very top of immense stones, with the object, as we were informed, of > guarding the temple precincts, so that if there were an attack, or an > insurrection or an onslaught of the enemy, no one would be able to force an > entrance within the walls that surround the temple. On the towers of the > citadel engines of war were placed and different kinds of machines, and the > position was much higher than the circle of walls which I have mentioned. > The towers were guarded too by most trusty men who had given the utmost > proof of their loyalty to their country. These men were never allowed to > leave the citadel, except on feast days and then only in detachments. nor > did they permit any stranger to enter it. They were also very careful when > any command came from the chief officer to admit any visitors to inspect the > place, as our own experience taught us. They were very reluctant to admit us > - though we were but two unarmed men - to view the offering of the > sacrifices. And they asserted that they were bound by an oath when the trust > was committed to them, for they had all sworn and were bound to carry out > the oath sacredly to the letter, that though they were five hundred in > number they would not permit more than five men to enter at one time. The > citadel was the special protection of the temple and its founder had > fortified it so strongly that it might efficiently protect it.The Letter of > Aristeas, 100-104\\\\. Translation by R. H. Charles The exact location of the citadel is not specified in this account, but the mention of an ascent to the Baris, as well as its location in a \\"very lofty spot\\", suggests the citadel overlooked the temple enclosure. As the citadel is in close proximity to the Temple, not on one of the other hills surrounding Jerusalem, the topographical nature of the Temple Mount affords only one such location - a rocky outcrop north of the temple enclosure, a spot where Herod the Great later built the Antonia Fortress. This is the precise location where the Persian citadel is supposed to have stood, suggesting the two may indeed be identical.Avi-Yonah, M. The Walls of Nahemiah ‚Äì a Minimalist View. Israel Exploration Journal IV, pp. 239 ‚Äì 248. It is not entirely clear when the Letter of Aristeas was written, although it is certainly much younger than the time of its supposed creation, in the middle of the 3rd century BC. Opinions differ on the exact date, although current research suggests the middle of the 2nd century BC.Honigman S. 2003. The Septuagint and Homeric Scholarship in Alexandria, pp. 128 ‚Äì 130. Routledge, London. Such a date would rule out the Hasmonean Baris or Antonia Fortress as the inspiration for the account, though not the Seleucid Acra. Thus, although it is not certain, the Letter of Aristeas may indeed preserve a genuine account of the citadel which stood in Jerusalem during Ptolemaic rule.Wightman G. J. 1990. Temple Fortresses in Jerusalem Part I: The Ptolemaic and Seleucid Akras. Bulletin of the Anglo- Israeli Archaeological Society 9, pp. 29-40.  Ultimate fate  Direct Seleucid control of Jerusalem was short lived, and around 168 BC the Hasmonean Revolt broke out. Although 2 Maccabees contains a reference to a citadel a few years before the revolt, there is not a single mention of a Hellenistic citadel north of the Temple enclosure during or after the revolt. Its sudden disappearance have led some to postulate that the Ptolemaic Baris and Seleucid Acra were in fact one and the same.Bar-Kochva. 1989. Judas Maccabeus, pp. 445‚Äì465. Cambridge All accounts of the Seleucid citadel, however, place its construction on the eve of the revolt. Furthermore, it is also believed to have been in the vicinity of the City of David, south of the Temple. The ultimate fate of the Baris is therefore a mystery. It has been suggested that its destruction coincided with the construction of the Seleucid Acra in 168 BC. Once that citadel had been built in a location that would allow it to control and harass the Jewish population of Jerusalem, at the time occupying the City of David, the old and defunct Baris may have been taken apart.Dequeker L. 1985.

The Canadian federal government has been described as the instigator of multiculturalism as an ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. The 1960s Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism is often referred to as the origin of modern political awareness of multiculturalism. Canadians have used the term \\"multiculturalism\\" in different ways: descriptively (as a sociological fact), prescriptively (as ideology) or politically (as policy). In the first sense \\"multiculturalism\\" is a description of the many different religious traditions and cultural influences that in their unity and coexistence result in a unique Canadian cultural mosaic. The nation consists of people from a multitude of racial, religious and cultural backgrounds and is open to cultural pluralism. Canada has experienced different waves of immigration since the nineteenth century, and by the 1980s almost 40 percent of the population were of neither British nor French origins (the two largest groups, and among the oldest).Troper, H. (1980). Multiculturalism Multicultural Canada. Retrieved March 28, 2012 In the past, the relationship between the British and the French has been given a lot of importance in Canada's history. By the early twenty-first century, people from outside British and French heritage composed the majority of the population, with an increasing percentage of individuals who identify themselves as \\"visible minorities\\". Multiculturalism is reflected with the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act of 1988 and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and is administered by the Department of Canadian Heritage. The Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. Despite the official policies, a small segment of the Canadian population are critical of the concept(s) of a cultural mosaic and implementation(s) of multiculturalism legislation. Quebec's ideology differs from that of the other provinces in that its official policies focus on interculturalism. Historical context Slavic immigrant family from Germany - photographed by William James Topley at Quebec City in 1911. In the 21st century Canada is often characterised as being \\"very progressive, diverse, and multicultural\\". However, Canada until the 1940s saw itself in terms of English and French cultural, linguistic and political identities, and to some extent indigenous. European immigrants speaking other languages, such as Canadians of German ethnicity and Ukrainian Canadians, were suspect, especially during the First World War when thousands were put in camps because they were citizens of enemy nations. Jewish Canadians were also suspect, especially in Quebec where anti-semitism was a factor and the Catholic Church of Quebec associated Jews with modernism, liberalism, and other unacceptable values. Asians encountered legal obstacles limiting immigration during the 1800s and early 1900s. Additional, specific ethnic groups that did immigrate during this time faced barriers within Canada preventing full participation in political and social matters, including equal pay and the right to vote. While black ex-slave refugees from the United States had been tolerated, racial minorities of African or Asian origin were generally believed \\"beyond the pale\\" (not acceptable to most people). Although this mood started to shift dramatically during the Second World War, Japanese Canadians were interned during the overseas conflict and their property confiscated. Prior to the advent of the Canadian Bill of Rights in 1960 and its successor the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, the laws of Canada did not provide much in the way of civil rights and it was typically of limited concern to the courts. Since the 1960s, Canada has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all people. Immigration The head tax was introduced in 1885, as a means of controlling Chinese immigration. Immigration has played an integral part in the development of multiculturalism within Canada during the last half of the 20th century. Legislative restrictions on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act) that had favoured British, American and European immigrants were amended during the 1960s, resulting in an influx of diverse people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. The number of people who are becoming immigrants is steadily increasing as seen between 2001 and 2006, the number of foreign-born people increased by 13.6%. By 2006 Canada had grown to have thirty four ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each, of which eleven have over 1,000,000 people and numerous others are represented in smaller amounts. 16.2% of the population identify themselves as a visible minority. Canada currently has one of the highest per capita immigration rate in the world, driven by economic policy and family reunification. Canada also resettles over one in ten of the world's refugees. In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Approximately 41% of Canadians are of either the first or second-generation. One out of every five Canadians currently living in Canada was born out of the country. The Canadian public as well as the major political parties support immigration. Political parties are cautious about criticizing the high level of immigration, because, as noted by The Globe and Mail, \\"in the early 1990s, the Reform Party\\" was branded 'racist' for suggesting that immigration levels be lowered from 250,000 to 150,000.\\" The party was also noted for their opposition to government-sponsored multiculturalism.Manning, 1992. Pviii. Settlement The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in Vancouver's Chinatown is the first full-size Chinese or \\"scholars\\" garden built outside of China Culturally diverse areas or \\"ethnic enclaves\\" are another way in which multiculturalism has manifested. Newcomers have tended to settle in the major urban areas. These urban enclaves have served as a home away from home for immigrants to Canada, while providing a unique experience of different cultures for those of long Canadian descent. In Canada, there are several ethnocentric communities with many diverse backgrounds, including Chinese, Italian and Greek. Canadian Chinatowns are one of the most prolific type of ethnic enclave found in major cities. These areas seemingly recreate an authentic Chinese experience within an urban community. During the first half of the 20th century, Chinatowns were associated with filth, seediness, and the derelict. By the late 20th century, Chinatown(s) had become areas worth preserving, a tourist attraction. They are now generally valued for their cultural significance and have become a feature of most large Canadian cities. Professor John Zucchi of McGill University states: Evolution of federal legislation Political cartoon on Canada's bicultural identity showing a flag combining symbols of Britain, France and Canada, from 1911. The Quebec Act, implemented after the British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for accommodation. A century later the compromises made between the English and French speaking Fathers of Confederation set Canada on a path to bilingualism, and this in turn contributed to biculturalism and the acceptance of diversity. The American writer Victoria Hayward in the 1922 book about her travels through Canada, described the cultural changes of the Canadian Prairies as a \\"mosaic\\". Another early use of the term mosaic to refer to Canadian society was by John Murray Gibbon, in his 1938 book Canadian Mosaic. The mosaic theme envisioned Canada as a \\"cultural mosaic\\" rather than a \\"melting pot\\". Charles Hobart a sociologist from the University of Alberta, and Lord Tweedsmuir the 15th Governor General of Canada were early champions of the term multiculturalism. From his installation speech in 1935 onwards, Lord Tweedsmuir maintained in speeches and over the radio recited his ideas that ethnic groups \\"should retain their individuality and each make its contribution to the national character,\\" and \\"the strongest nations are those that are made up of different racial elements.\\" Ad√©lard Godbout, while Premier of Quebec in 1943, published an article entitled \\"Canada: Unity in Diversity\\" in the Council on Foreign Relations journal discussing the influence of the Francophone population as a whole. The phrase \\"Unity in diversity\\" would be used frequently during Canadian multiculturalism debates in the proceeding decades. The beginnings of the development of Canada's contemporary policy of multiculturalism can be traced to the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, which was established on July 19, 1963 by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in response to the grievances of Canada's French-speaking minority. The report of the Commission advocated that the Canadian government should recognize Canada as a bilingual and bicultural society and adopt policies to preserve this character. Monument to Multiculturalism by Francesco Pirelli in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Four identical sculptures are located in Buffalo City, South Africa; Changchun, China; Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Sydney, Australia. The recommendations of this report elicited a variety of responses. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, (who was now Leader of the Official Opposition after his government was succeeded by that of Pearson on April 22, 1963), viewed them as an attack on his \\"One Canada Policy\\" that was opposed to extending accommodation to minority groups. The proposals also failed to satisfy those Francophones in the Province of Quebec who gravitated toward Qu√©b√©cois nationalism. Additionally, Canadians of neither English nor French descent (so-called \\"Third Force\\" Canadians) advocated that a policy of \\"multiculturalism\\" would better reflect the diverse heritage of Canada's peoples. Paul Yuzyk, a Progressive Conservative Senator of Ukrainian descent, referred to Canada as \\"a multicultural nation\\" in his influential maiden speech in 1964, creating much national debate, and is remembered for his strong advocacy of the implementation of a multiculturalism policy and Social liberalism. On October 8, 1971, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau announced in the House of Commons that, after much deliberation, the policies of bilingualism and multiculturalism would be implemented in Canada. The next day, Prime Minister Trudeau reiterated the Canadian government's support for \\"cultivation and use of many languages\\" at the 10th Congress of the Ukrainian Canadian Committee in Winnipeg. Trudeau espoused participatory democracy as a means of making Canada a \\"Just Society\\". Trudeau stated: When the Canadian constitution was patriated by Prime Minister Trudeau in 1982, one of its constituent documents was the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and section 27 of the Charter stipulates that the rights laid out in the document are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the spirit of multiculturalism. The Canadian Multiculturalism Act was introduced during the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, and received Royal Assent on July 21, 1988. On a practical level, a result of the Multiculturalism Act was that federal funds began to be distributed to ethnic groups to help them preserve their cultures, leading to such projects as the construction of community centres. In June 2000 Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien stated: With this in mind on November 13, 2002, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien designated, by Royal Proclamation, June 27 of each year Canadian Multiculturalism Day. Charter of Rights and Freedoms Section Twenty-seven of the Charter states that: Section Fifteen of the Charter that covers equality states: Canadian Multiculturalism Act The 1988 Canadian Multiculturalism Act affirms the policy of the government to ensure that every Canadian receives equal treatment by the government which respects and celebrates diversity. The \\"Act\\" in general recognizes: *Canada's multicultural heritage and that that heritage must be protected. *The rights of indigenous peoples. *English and French remain the only official languages, however other languages may be used. *Social equality within society and under the law regardless of race, colour, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, creed or religion. *Minorities' rights to enjoy their cultures. Section 3 (1) of the act states: Broadcasting Act In the Multiculturalism Act, the federal government proclaimed the recognition of the diversity of Canadian culture. Similarly the Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. The CRTC is the governmental body which enforces the Broadcasting Act. The CRTC revised their Ethnic Broadcasting Policy in 1999 to go into the details on the conditions of the distribution of ethnic and multilingual programming. One of the conditions that this revision specified was the amount of ethnic programming needed in order to be awarded the ethnic broadcasting licence. According to the act, 60% of programming on a channel, whether on the radio or television, has to be considered ethnic in order to be approved for the licence under this policy. Provincial legislation and policies All ten of Canada's provinces have some form of multiculturalism policy. At present, six of the ten provinces ‚Äì British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, and Nova Scotia ‚Äì have enacted multiculturalism legislation. In eight provinces ‚Äì British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia ‚Äì a multiculturalism advisory council reports to the minister responsible for multiculturalism. In Alberta, the Alberta Human Rights Commission performs the role of multiculturalism advisory council. In Nova Scotia, the Act is implemented by both a Cabinet committee on multiculturalism and advisory councils. Ontario has an official multicultural policy and the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration is responsible for promoting social inclusion, civic and community engagement and recognition. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador launched the province's policy on multiculturalism in 2008 and the Minister of Advanced Education and Skills leads its implementation. While the territorial governments do not have multiculturalism policies per se, they have human rights acts that prohibit discrimination based on, among other things, race, colour, ancestry, ethnic origin, place of origin, creed or religion. In Whitehorse, the Multicultural Centre of the Yukon provides services to immigrants. British Columbia British Columbia legislated the Multiculturalism Act in 1993. The purposes of this act (s. 2) are: Alberta Alberta primarily legislated the Alberta Cultural Heritage Act in 1984 and refined it with the Alberta Multiculturalism Act in 1990. The current legislation pertaining to multiculturalism is The Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Act that passed in 1996. This current legislation deals with discrimination in race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, physical disability, age, marital status and sexual orientation, among other things. Alberta Human Rights chapter A‚Äë25.5 states: Saskatchewan Saskatchewan was the first Canadian province to adopt legislation on multiculturalism. This piece of legislation was called The Saskatchewan Multiculturalism Act of 1974, but has since been replaced by the new, revised Multiculturalism Act (1997). The purposes of this act (s. 3) are similar to those of British Columbia: The motto of the province of Saskatchewan, adopted in 1986, is Multis e gentibus vires (‚Äúfrom many peoples, strength‚Äù or ‚Äúout of many peoples, strength‚Äù). Manitoba Manitoba's first piece of legislation on multiculturalism was the Manitoba Intercultural Council Act in 1984. However, in the summer on 1992, the province developed a new provincial legislation called the Multiculturalism Act. The purposes of this act (s. 2) are to: Ontario Ontario had a policy in place in 1977 that promoted cultural activity, but formal legislation for a Ministry of Citizenship and Culture (now known as Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration) only came to fruition in 1982. The Ministry of Citizenship and Culture Act (1990) (s. 4) states its purpose: Quebec Quebec differs from the rest of the nine provinces in that its policy focuses on \\"interculturalism\\"- rather than multiculturalism, where diversity is strongly encouraged, but only under the notion that it is within the framework that establishes French as the public language. Immigrant children must attend French language schools; most signage in English-only is banned (but bilingual signage is common in many communities). In 1990, Quebec released a White paper called Lets Build Quebec Together: A Policy Statement on Integration and Immigration which reinforced three main points: In 2005, Quebec passed legislation to develop the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities, their functions were: In 2015, when the Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) took a nationalist turn, they advocated for \\"exempting Quebec from the requirements of multiculturalism.\\". One of the key priorities for the CAQ when elected in 2018 Quebec election was reducing the number of immigrants, to 40,000 annually; a 20 per cent reduction. New Brunswick New Brunswick first introduced their multicultural legislation in 1986. The policy is guided by four principles: equality, appreciation, preservation of cultural heritages and participation. In the 1980s the provincial government developed a Ministerial Advisory Committee to provide assistance to the minister of Business in New Brunswick, who is in turn responsible for settlement and multicultural communities. Nova Scotia Nova Scotia introduced their multicultural legislation, the Act to Promote and Preserve Multiculturalism, in 1989. The purpose of this Act is (s. 3): Prince Edward Island Prince Edward Island introduced their legislation on multiculturalism, the Provincial Multicultural Policy, in 1988. This policies objectives were (s. 4): Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador first legislated their Policy on Multiculturalism in 2008. Some of the policies are to: Domestic support and global influence Canadian multiculturalism is looked upon with admiration outside the country, resulting in the Canadian public dismissing most critics of the concept. Multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. Multiculturalism has been emphasized in recent decades. Emma Ambrose and Cas Mudde examining surveys of Western nations report: Ambrose and Mudde conclude that: \\"Canada's unique multiculturalism policy... is based on a combination of selective immigration, comprehensive integration, and strong state repression of dissent on these policies\\". This unique blend of policies has led to a relatively low level of opposition to multiculturalism. Canadian supporters of multiculturalism promote the idea because they believe that immigrants help society grow culturally, economically and politically. Supporters declare that multiculturalism policies help in bringing together immigrants and minorities in the country and pushes them towards being part of the Canadian society as a whole. Supporters also argue that cultural appreciation of ethnic and religious diversity promotes a greater willingness to tolerate political differences. Andrew Griffith argues that, \\"89 percent of Canadians believe that foreign-born Canadians are just as likely to be good citizens as those born in Canada....But Canadians clearly view multiculturalism in an integrative sense, with an expectation that new arrivals will adopt Canadian values and attitudes.\\" Griffith adds that, \\"There are virtually no differences between Canadian-born and foreign-born with respect to agreement to abide by Canadian values (70 and 68 percent, respectively).\\" Richard Gwyn has suggested that \\"tolerance\\" has replaced \\"loyalty\\" as the touchstone of Canadian identity. The Global Centre for Pluralism is located in Ottawa on Sussex Drive at the former location of the Canadian War Museum. Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, described Canada as: \\"the most successful pluralist society on the face of our globe, without any doubt in my mind.... That is something unique to Canada. It is an amazing global human asset. Aga Khan explained that the experience of Canadian governance ‚Äì its commitment to pluralism and its support for the rich multicultural diversity of its peoples ‚Äì is something that must be shared and would be of benefit to societies in other parts of the world. With this in mind, in 2006 the Global Centre for Pluralism was established in partnership with the Government of Canada. A 2008 survey by the Association for Canadian Studies of 600 immigrants showed that 81% agreed with the statement; ‚ÄúThe rest of the world could learn from Canada's multicultural policy‚Äù. The Economist ran a cover story in 2016 praising Canada as the most successful multicultural society in the West. The Economist argued that Canada's multiculturalism was a source of strength that united the diverse population and by attracting immigrants from around the world was also an engine of economic growth as well. Criticisms Critics of multiculturalism in Canada often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical or even desirable. In the introduction to an article which presents research showing that \\"the multiculturalism policy plays a positive role\\" in \\"the process of immigrant and minority integration,\\" Citizenship and immigration Canada sums up the critics' position by stating: Chinatown is an ethnic enclave located in the city centre Canadian Neil Bissoondath in his book Selling Illusions: The Cult of Multiculturalism in Canada, argues that official multiculturalism limits the freedom of minority members, by confining them to cultural and geographic ethnic enclaves (\\"social ghettos\\"). He also argues that cultures are very complex, and must be transmitted through close family and kin relations. To him, the government view of cultures as being about festivals and cuisine is a crude oversimplification that leads to easy stereotyping. Canadian Daniel Stoffman's book Who Gets In questions the policy of Canadian multiculturalism. Stoffman points out that many cultural practices (outlawed in Canada), such as allowing dog meat to be served in restaurants and street cockfighting, are simply incompatible with Canadian and Western culture. He also raises concern about the number of recent older immigrants who are not being linguistically integrated into Canada (i.e., not learning either English or French). He stresses that multiculturalism works better in theory than in practice and Canadians need to be far more assertive about valuing the \\"national identity of English-speaking Canada\\". Professor Joseph Garcea, the Department Head of Political Studies at the University of Saskatchewan, explores the validity of attacks on multiculturalism because it supposedly segregates the peoples of Canada. He argues that multiculturalism hurts the Canadian, Qu√©b√©cois, and indigenous cultures, identity, and nationalism projects. Furthermore, he argues, it perpetuates conflicts between and within groups. When Jason Kenney, was made parliamentary secretary and secretary of state for multiculturalism in 2008, then Prime Minister Stephen Harper raised concerns to Kenney that \\"multiculturalism cannot lead to the ghettoization of immigrants.\\" In 2003 when the Progressive Conservative party created a research dossier of remarks by Harper; they pointed out that a statement in 2001 where accused immigrants and recent migrants from eastern Canada in ridings that are \\"west of Winnipeg the ridings the Liberals\\" of living in a ghetto and do not integrate into Western Canada. A 2017 Poll found 37% of Canadians said too many refugees were coming to Canada, up from 30% in 2016. The 2017 poll also asked respondents about their comfort levels around people of different races and religions, a question that was also asked in 2005-06. This year, 89% said they were comfortable around people of a different race, down from 94% in 2005-2006. Quebec society Despite an official national bilingualism policy, many commentators from Quebec believe multiculturalism threatens to reduce them to just another ethnic group. Quebec's policy seeks to promote interculturalism, welcoming people of all origins while insisting that they integrate into Quebec's majority French-speaking society. In 2008, a Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences, headed by sociologist Gerard Bouchard and philosopher Charles Taylor, recognized that Quebec is a de facto pluralist society, but that the Canadian multiculturalism model \\"does not appear well suited to conditions in Quebec\\".

Max-Joseph-Platz serves as the western starting point of the royal avenue Maximilianstra√üe. Architecture The square was constructed with the erection of the National Theatre Munich at its east side, which was opened in 1818. Opposite to its Corinthian columns at the west side are middle-class houses. The north side is framed by the K√∂nigsbau of the Munich Residence. King Ludwig I of Bavaria instructed his architect Leo von Klenze to build the King's tract in the south of his palace in the style of the Florentine Palazzo Pitti. The facade of the Residenz Theatre is situated between the K√∂nigsbau and the National Theatre. The south of Max-Joseph-Platz is dominated by the Neo-Renaissance arcades of the former Palais Toerring-Jettenbach, a rococo mansion which originates from 1747. The Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence served as model for its columns. The monument Max-Joseph Denkmal before the K√∂nigsbau was created in the middle of the square as a memorial for King Maximilian Joseph by Christian Daniel Rauch and carried out by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier. It was only revealed in 1835 since the king had rejected to be eternalized in sitting position. After World War II a subterranean garage was constructed below the Max-Joseph-Platz, its gateway disturbs the neo-classical appearance of the square.

Sara Bj√∂rk has been part of Iceland's national team since 2007 and represented her country at the 2009, 2013 and 2017 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship. In December 2018, she was named the Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year. In August 2020, she became the first Icelander to win the UEFA Women's Champions League. Club career Sara Bj√∂rk joined local team Haukar at the age of six and remained until she was 18. After three subsequent seasons with Brei√∞ablik, she left Iceland in 2011, to sign a three- year professional contract with Swedish club LdB FC Malm√∂. She was an immediate success in Sweden, contributing 12 goals as Malm√∂ won the Damallsvenskan title. In August 2013 she announced the extension of her Malm√∂ contract for another two and a half seasons via Twitter. In May 2016, Sara Bj√∂rk announced that she would not extend her contract with Malm√∂ (now known as FC Roseng√•rd) and planned to leave Sweden after winning four Damallsvenskan titles in five years. At that stage she did not confirm speculation that she was heading for German club VfL Wolfsburg. Shortly afterwards the transfer to Wolfsburg was made official, ahead of their 2016‚Äì17 season. In her four seasons with Wolfsburg, the club won the Frauen-Bundesliga and the German Cup each year. On 1 July 2020, she joined Olympique Lyonnais. On 9 August, she won her first title with the club when it deafeated Paris Saint-Germain in the Coupe de France after penalties. On 30 August, she scored one goal in Olympique Lyonnais' 3‚Äì1 win against her former club, Wolfsburg, in the UEFA Women's Champions League final. International career Sara Bj√∂rk was included in Iceland's senior national squad in August 2007, aged 16. She had recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament injury after having to delay surgery because she was too young and her bones were not yet fused. Still a month short of her 17th birthday, she made her national team debut in a UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying match versus Slovenia in Dravograd. Sara Bj√∂rk substituted in for Katr√≠n √ìmarsd√≥ttir on 87 minutes. Sara Bj√∂rk's gossiping teammates started a false rumour that she was having an affair with the married national team coach, Siggi Eyj√≥lfsson. Sara Bj√∂rk playing an international friendly against Sweden at Myresj√∂hus Arena in V√§xj√∂, 6 April 2013 Sara Bj√∂rk scored twice in Iceland's 3‚Äì1 win over Norway at the 2009 Algarve Cup and was selected in the squad for the UEFA Women's Euro 2009 finals in Finland. She played in all three group matches as Iceland were eliminated in the first round. Eyj√≥lfsson selected Sara Bj√∂rk in the Iceland squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2013, where she played in all four matches including the 4‚Äì0 quarter-final defeat to hosts Sweden. With Margr√©t L√°ra Vi√∞arsd√≥ttir on maternity leave, incoming national coach Freyr Alexandersson appointed Sara Bj√∂rk as Iceland's new team captain in 2014. Sara Bj√∂rk limped out of the 2018 UEFA Women's Champions League Final with an injury.

It lies on the bank of the river Brahmaputra, approximately from the city of Guwahati. Once considered the cradle of black magic in India, Mayong is a tourist attraction because of its history. Etymology The origins of the name may be based on any of several sources including the Sanskrit word Maya (illusion), the Chutia/Tiwa/Deori word Ma-yong which means mother, the Dimasa word for an elephant (Miyong), or from maa for Mother Shakti and ongo meaning part. Some believe that Manipuris from the Moirang clan used to inhabit this area therefore; the name Moirang became Mayhong with time.http://www.newsgram.com/mayong-assam-the-land-of-myth-and-magic/ Mythology Mayong along with Pragjyotishpura (the ancient name of Assam) find place in many mythological epics, including the Mahabharata. Chief Ghatotkacha of Kachari Kingdom took part in The Great Battle of Mahabharata with his magical powers. It was also said about the Mayong that the saints of black magic and the witches take shelter in mayong forest till now. According to recently published article on \\"Mayong - Land of Black Magic and Witchcraft\\" - many tales of men disappearing into thin air, people being converted into animals, or beasts being magically tamed, have been associated with Mayong. Sorcery and magic were traditionally practiced and passed down over generations. This was shown on 6 April 2019 at 10:15pm on zee news and reporter Sohail hosted the show. Also they have shown some actual magic done by villagers. History Narabali or human sacrifices were carried out in connection with the worship of Shakti until the early modern period. Excavators had recently dug up swords and other sharp weapons that resembled tools used for human sacrifice in other parts of India, suggesting that human sacrifice may have occurred in the Ahom era in Mayong. In year 1337 Mohd. Shah want to usurp asaam with the help of their 1Lakh horsemans but the people of mayong village vanished all horseman soldires from land by their black magic powers. Tourism Mayong is a tourist and archaeological location because of its rich wildlife, archaeology pilgrimage, eco-tourism, adventure tourism, cultural tourism and river tourism. There are numerous archaeological relics and artefacts, including books on black magic and Ayurveda at the Mayong Central Museum and Emporium, which was opened in 2002.

Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that pelagic coastal fish are generally epipelagic fish, inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone.Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 585 Coastal fish can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which inhabit the deep seas beyond the continental shelves. Coastal fish are the most abundant in the world. They can be found in tidal pools, fjords and estuaries, near sandy shores and rocky coastlines, around coral reefs and on or above the continental shelf. Coastal fish include forage fish and the predator fish that feed on them. Forage fish thrive in inshore waters where high productivity results from upwelling and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycles in the zone.Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 572 Coastal habitats Coastal fish are found in the waters above the continental shelves that extend from the continental shorelines, and around the coral reefs that surround volcanic islands. The total world shoreline extends for World The World Factbook, CIA. Retrieved 26 February 2010. and the continental shelves occupy a total area of 24.286 million km2 (9 376 million sq mi).Continental shelf areas Earth trends. Retrieved 25 February 2010. This is about 4.8% of the world's total area of 510.072 million km2. Nearshore fish Nearshore fish, sometimes called littoral fish, live close to the shore. They are associated with the intertidal zone, or with estuaries, lagoons, coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, or rocky or sandy bottoms, usually in shallow waters less than about 10 m deep. Intertidal fish Intertidal fish are fish that move in and out with the tide in the intertidal zone of the seashore, or are found in rock pools or under rocks. The intertidal zone of rocky shores can contain indentations which trap pools of salty water, called rock pools. Living in these habitats are communities of hardy plant and animal species specially adapted for coping with the volatile environment around them. The plants and animals interact with each other and with the rock pool to form miniature ecosystems, easily accessible to students and a source of fascination for young children. Plants such as seaweeds, cnidarians such as sea anemones, arthropods like barnacles, and molluscs such as the common limpet and the common periwinkle can be permanent residents of rock pools. But most rock pool animals, such as crabs, shrimp and fish are just temporary residents, occupying a rock pool only until the next tide takes them to a new location. Some rock pool fish which are temporary residents include the long- spined sea scorpion, the pipefish worm, the rock goby and the common lumpsucker. However some other rock pool fish are territorial in nature, and will stay with the same pool for extended periods. Examples are the common blenny and its near relative the butterfish. * The common blenny, also known as the shanny, is found in northern temperate waters. They hide under rocks and in crannies in rock pools when the tide is out. They feed on green seaweed and invertebrates such as barnacles. They can crawl on dry land, using their paired fins. About 16 cm long, they have smooth skin, without scales, and are covered with soft slime. The slime prevents them drying if they are stranded on a shore between tides. So long as their skin stays moist, they can breathe out of water. They are sometimes called \\"sea frogs\\" because they bask in the sun on weeds outside the water, and like frogs, jump to safety when disturbed. They can change their colour to match their surroundings. The female lays eggs in crevices or under stones and the male guards them until they hatch. In the winter, when storms can be severe, they move out of their rock pools into the shallows. The common blenny is bold with strong teeth, and will bite humans if it feels threatened.Shanny (common blenny) BBC. Updated July 2005. * The rock goby is a small fish, about 12 cm long, found in northern temperate waters. It is coloured black with white blotches, and hides under stones and amongst seaweed. It is a temporary resident of rock pools when the tide is out. The female rock goby lays eggs on the underside of rocks and shells and then leaves them. The male guards the eggs until they hatch. First-year rock gobies often visit rock pools in winter when the older fish have left. File:Australian blenny.jpg|Australian blenny File:Gobius_paganellus.jpg|Rock goby File:Long_Spined_Scorpion_Fish.jpg|Long-spined sea scorpion File:smooth lumpsucker.jpg|Smooth lumpsucker inflated in a defensive response. * The long-spined sea scorpion, a small stout fish which grows about 29 cm long, is another temporary resident of rocky pools. They have large black eyes, a large mouth, and four long spines‚Äîtwo on each side on the gill cover‚Äîthat stick out when the fish is removed from the water. They also have an organ like a finger on each side of their mouths which helps them catch prey. Because of their broad heads, they are also called \\"bullheads\\". They have a variety of effective camouflaged colours ranging from shades of browns with cream blotches, to orange and red with white blotches. They can also change their body colour to match their surroundings. They are found around the coasts of Northern Europe in shallow rocky waters hiding amongst seaweed. They are also found in rock pools and sometimes in waters 30 m deep. Long-spined sea scorpions lay eggs amongst seaweed or attached to rock crevices. The young hatch after two or three weeks, and go through several development stages before maturing into adults. * Lumpsuckers are found in temperate northern waters. They live on the seafloor, and are temporary residents of rocky pools in late winter and early spring when they spawn. The body of the lumpsucker is scaleless and covered with small lumps. They have a large sucking disc on their underside which they use to cling to surfaces. They are normally a blue to slate-grey colour, and are effectively camouflaged to look like stones. They are portly, nearly spherical, poor swimmers, reaching lengths up to 50 cm. After the female lumpsucker lays eggs, the male takes over, clamping itself to a rock where it guards the eggs. When they hatch, lumpsuckers look like tiny tadpoles. They remain in shallow water and rock pools, hiding amongst seaweed and rocks, until they grow up. Estuarine fish This estuary of the Klamath River is a transition zone between a freshwater river environment and a saltwater marine environment. Due to land runoff, river mouths and estuary waters can be turbid and nutrient rich, sometimes to the point of eutrophication. Estuaries are partly enclosed coastal bodies of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into them, and with a free connection to the open sea.Pritchard, D. W. (1967) What is an estuary: physical viewpoint. p. 3‚Äì5 in: G. H. Lauf (ed.) Estuaries, A.A.A.S. Publ. No. 83, Washington, D.C. These brackish water habitats form a transition zone between river environments and ocean environments, and ecological successions can form along the way. Estuaries are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflow of both seawater and freshwater provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries productive natural habitats.McLusky, D.S. and Elliott, M. (2004) \\"The Estuarine Ecosystem: ecology, threats and management.\\" New York: Oxford University Press Inc. Fishes that spend time in estuaries (or river mouths) need to be euryhaline (tolerant to a range of salinities). Estuaries provide an unstable environment for fish, where the salinity changes and the waters are often muddy and turbulent. In warmer climates, estuaries have mangroves around their edges. At times there may be only a few different fish species present in an estuary, but seasonal migrants, including eels, salmonids, and some forage fish such as herrings and sprats increase the diversity in the estuary.Moyle and Cech, 2003, p. 50. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of anadromous and catadromus fish species, such as salmon and eels, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as \\"nursery grounds\\" for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. For example, herring and plaice are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose. Mangrove swamps are associated brackish water habitats. Many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. Among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are mudskippers, fish that forage for food on land, and archer fish, perch-like fish that \\"spit\\" at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as snappers, halfbeaks, and tarpon spawning or maturing among them. Coral reef fish Coral reefs support flourishing ecosystems, paradoxically in clear, low nutrient waters, along tropical continental coasts and around volcanic islands. Coral reef fish are numerous and diverse. In tropical waters, coral reef fish live amongst or in close relation to coral reefs. Coral reefs form complex ecosystems with tremendous biodiversity. Coral reef fish can be particularly colourful and interesting to watch. Hundreds of species can exist in a small area of a healthy reef, many of them hidden or well camouflaged. Reef fish have developed many ingenious specialisations adapted to survival on the reefs. Coral reefs occupy less than one percent of the surface area of the world oceans, yet they provide a home for 25 percent of all marine fish species. Coral reefs often depend on other habitats in the surrounding area for the supply of nutrients, such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests. Seagrass and mangroves supply dead plants and animals which are rich in nitrogen and also serve to feed fish and animals from the reef by supplying wood and vegetation. Reefs in turn protect mangroves and seagrass from waves and produce sediment for the mangroves and seagrass to root in.Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs The sea goldie is an anthias. They are hermaphrodite, and swim in \\"harems\\" Anthias are members of the family Serranidae and make up the subfamily Anthiinae. They are widespread in tropical waters. They have been called the \\"quintessential reef fish\\", and make up a sizeable portion of the colourful fishes seen swarming in coral reef photography. Anthias are mostly small, peaceful, beautiful and popular as ornamental fish. They are mainly zooplankton feeders. Anthias shoal and school in large numbers, operating more intimate \\"harems\\" within the schools. These harems contain a dominant and colourful male, between 2 and 12 females ‚Äî who operate a hierarchy among themselves ‚Äî and one or two \\"subdominant\\" males, often less brightly coloured and non-territorial. Within the swarm of females, territorial males perform acrobatic U-swim displays and vigorously defend an area of the reef and its associated harem. Anthias are protogynous hermaphrodites. All anthias are born female; if a dominant male perishes, the largest female of the group will often change into a male to take its place. This may lead to squabbling between the next largest male and the transforming female, whose hormones are now surging with testosterone. This can turn quite vicious in the limited confines of captivity. The foureye butterflyfish has a false eyespot on its sides, which can confuse prey and predators. Butterflyfish are group of about 120 species belonging to the family Chaetodontidaeof Perchiformes. They include bannerfish and coralfish. They are widespread on coral reefs. Butterflyfish are mostly between in length. The largest species, the lined butterflyfish and saddle butterflyfish, grow to . Many species are brightly coloured and strikingly patterned, though other species are dull in colour. Many have eyespots on their flanks and dark bands across their eyes, not unlike the patterns seen on butterfly wings. Their deep, laterally narrow bodies are easily noticed through the profusion of reef life. The conspicuous colouration of butterflyfish may be intended for interspecies communication. Butterflyfish have uninterrupted dorsal fins with tail fins that may be rounded or truncated, but are never forked. Generally diurnal and frequenting waters of less than (though some species descend to ), butterflyfish stick to particular home ranges. The corallivores are especially territorial, forming mated pairs and staking claim to a specific coral head. Contrastingly, the zooplankton feeders form large conspecific groups. By night butterflyfish hide in reef crevices and exhibit markedly different colouration. Their colouration also makes butterflyfish popular aquarium fish. However, most species feed on coral polyps and sea anemones, which can result in problems for the hobby aquarists. left Clownfish, anemonefish and damselfish are among about 360 species classified in the family Pomacentridae. Most Pomacentrids are associated with coral reefs in the Indo-West Pacific, with a few species occurring in temperate waters. Some species are native to freshwater or brackish estuarine environments. Most live in shallow water, from , although some species are found below . Most species are specialists, living in specific parts of the reef, such as sandy lagoons, steep reef slopes, or areas exposed to strong wave action. In general, the coral is used as shelter, and many species can only survive in its presence. The bottom-dwelling species are territorial, occupying and defending a portion of the reef, often centred around an area of shelter. By keeping away other species of fish, some pomacentrids encourage the growth of thick mats of algae within their territories, leading to the common name farmerfish. Different species display a wide range of colours, although some are relatively drab. Pomacentrids are omnivorous or herbivorous, feeding off algae, plankton, and small bottom- dwelling crustaceans. A small number eat coral. blue-striped snappers Goatfishes are a family Mullidae of about 55 species of perciform fishes, associated worldwide with tropical reefs. They are typically about 20 cm long, though the dash-and-dot goatfish, grows to 55 cm. Goatfish are tireless benthic feeders, possess a pair of long chemosensory barbels (\\"whiskers\\") protruding from their chins resembling a goat's beard. They use these to rifle through the sediments in search of a meal. Like goats, they seek anything edible; worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates are staples. Many species of goatfish are conspicuously coloured and have the ability to change their colouration depending on their current activity. By day, many form large inactive (non-feeding) schools: these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin goatfish school with blue-striped snappers. When they do that, the yellowfins changes its colouration to match that of the snapper. By night the schools disperse and individual goatfish head their separate ways to loot the sands. The diurnal goldsaddle goatfish changes from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream when feeding. Other nocturnal feeders will shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for overlooked morsels. Goatfish stay within the shallows, going no deeper than about 110 metres. Most species do not tolerate brackish water, so they do not enter estuaries or the mouths of rivers. Other nearshore fish Kelp forests can provide shelter and food for shallow water fish Other nearshore or shallow water fish live near the shore in depths of less than 10 metres. They occupy the areas over sandy or rocky bottoms, and can be associated with seagrass meadows and kelp forests. They can be divided into demersal fish and pelagic fish. Demersal fish live on or near the sea floor, while pelagic fish live in the water column away the sea floor. Examples of such shallow water demersal fish, found in both tropical and temperate waters around the world, are triplefins, seahorses, wrasse and flounder. As demersal fish, all these fish spend most of their time on or near the sea floor. * Flatfish are superbly adapted groundfish, found on muddy and sandy sea floors. In many species both eyes lie on one side of the head, one or the other migrating through and around the head during development. Some species face their \\"left\\" side upward, some face their \\"right\\" side upward, and others face either side upward. Some flatfish can camouflage themselves on the ocean floor. * Wrasse are a large family of mainly small fish, usually less than long. Most wrasse are loners that prefer habitats such as coral reefs and rocky shores. They live close to the substrate, eating small invertebrates and almost anything else that lurks on the bottom. Many are brightly coloured. They have thick lips and use their sharp teeth to pick small creatures off the rocks. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. * Triplefins are a family of fish. They are usually found around coral reefs and rocks, usually in shallow, clear sunlit waters such as lagoons and seaward reefs. Triplefins have three dorsal fins (hence the name). They are small fish, usually less than six cm long. Brightly coloured, often for reasons of camouflage, they are nervous and retreat to rock crevices at any perceived threat. * Seahorses are a genus of fish. They prefer sheltered harbours, estuaries and other shallow coastal waters, where they hunt tiny crustaceans. They bob around in sheltered areas such as coral reefs, mangrove stands and seagrass meadows and estuaries. They are camouflaged with murky patterns that blend into kelp and sea grass backgrounds. During social moments or in unusual surroundings, seahorses can turn on bright colours.

As pelagic fish, all these fish spend most of their time living in the water column away the sea floor. * The grey mullet are medium size fish, typically about long. They are often caught with seine nets. * The garfish is a long, slender fish, looking like a spear, which feeds on seagrass fragments, shrimps and crab larvae. In turn it is preyed on by larger fish and, since it is often near the surface, cormorants and gannets. File:Mucep u0.gif|Grey mullet File:Belone belone1.jpg|Garfish Plankton feeding pelagic fish World distribution of plankton Areas of upwelling in red. At the base of food chains are the primary producers. In the ocean these primary producers are mainly a type of plankton, microscopic phytoplankton which drift in the water column. Phytoplankton need sunlight for photosynthesis to power carbon fixation, so they are mainly located in sunlit surface waters. Phytoplankton also need and rapidly use nutrients in the water column.Anderson, G (2003) Coral Reef Formation Marine Science. The phytoplankton are eaten by zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by predatory zooplankton. Filter feeders then eat the plankton and larger predatory fish eat the filter feeders (see diagram at the right).Mann, K.H., Lazier, J.R.N. (2006) Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems: Biological-Physical Interactions in the Oceans. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. Most filter-feeding pelagic fish found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, shad, sardines and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate with each other in open coastal waters. Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Worldwide, there are five major coastal currents associated with upwelling areas: the Canary Current (off Northwest Africa), the Benguela Current (off southern Africa), the California Current (off California and Oregon), the Humboldt Current (off Peru and Chile), and the Somali Current (off Western India). All of these currents support major fisheries. Many forage fish are important commercial species, and the schools can be targeted by spotter planes. The fish are caught by purse seiners‚Äîfishing boats that use nets to enclose the fish‚Äîand can be overfished.

They tend to be larger fish, and are carnivorous, feeding on the smaller, silvery forage fish that eat plankton (see section above). Some species also feed on crabs and other invertebrates, foraged from the sea floor. *Mackerel scom Porgies sometimes called sea breams, are any of about 100 species belonging to the family Sparidae. Porgies usually have high backs and a single dorsal fin, like snapper or grunt fishes (grunts are named for the sound they make grinding their teeth). They are bottom feeding pelagic fishes, with small mouths equipped with strong teeth adapted for handling small fishes and invertebrates with hard shells. Most do not exceed a size of about , but some may grow to four times that length.Porgy Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved February 23, 2010. They often school, and will migrate between reefs. Larger fish enter estuaries and harbours. * Barracuda have long slender bodies typically about long. They have a wicked set of teeth and are ferocious predators. They feed on crustaceans, cephalopods and small fish like anchovy and pilchard. Barracouta often hunt in schools near the bottom or midwater, and sometimes even near the surface at night.

Its numbers are declining, and it is now listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. Giant trevally are great gamefish found in Indo-Pacific tropical waters. They are powerful apex predators in most of their habitats, hunting both individually and in schools. * Cutlassfishes are a group of about 40 species belonging to the family Trichiuridae. They are ocean fish which regularly stray into coastal waters around the world. Fish of this family are long, slender, and generally steely blue or silver in colour, giving rise to their name. They have reduced or absent pelvic and caudal fins, giving them an eel-like appearance, and large fang-like teeth. * Jacks, amberjacks, pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and trevally are fish of the family Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7 m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25‚Äì100 cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species. ** Amberjacks are a group of nine species belonging to the genus Seriola within the family Carangidae. Mainly open water fish, they can follow small forage fish into estuaries and enclosed waters, where they will also hunt for crustaceans. Amberjacks are fast swimming and aggressive predators that often hunt in schools around offshore reefs. the yellowtail amberjack can reach 1.8 metres in length and weigh 60 kilograms. Demersal fish Cod-like fishes, like this morid cod have a barbel (fleshy filament) on their lower jaw which they use to detect prey buried in the sand or mud. Fish that live on or in close association with the sea floor are called demersal fish. This section discusses the coastal demersal fish that live on the continental shelf, but are living further from the coast and in deeper water than the nearshore fish discussed above. Demersal fish are white fish. Unlike oily fish, white fish contain oils only in their liver, rather than in the gut, and can therefore be gutted as soon as they are caught, on board the ship. White fish has dry and white flesh. They can be divided into benthopelagic fish (mostly \\"round\\" fish) which live near the sea bed, such as cod, and benthic fish (flatfish) such as plaice which live on the sea bed. Benthic fish tend to be \\"flat\\", so they can lie on the bottom. * Cod-like fishes are a number of round benthopelagic species belonging to the order Gadiformes, such as Atlantic and Pacific cod, morid cod, haddock and pollock, including the highly commercial Alaska pollock. Cod-like fishes are often found in large schools over sandy or muddy bottoms. They have a barbel (fleshy filament) on their lower jaw which they use to detect prey buried in the sand or mud. Some migrate to warm water in winter to spawn. * John Dory are fishes of the genus Zeus. They have a widespread distribution and are typically found near the seabed in depths from . The John Dory grows to a maximum length of . Although it is a benthopelagic fish, its body is flat and it can hardly be seen from the front because it is so thin. It is a poor swimmer with long spines on the dorsal fin. It has a large dark eyespot on the side of its body which is used to confuse prey, which are scooped up in its big mouth. Large eyes at the front of the head provide it with bifocal vision and depth perception, which are important for predators. The John Dory usually gets its food by stalking it then shooting out a tube in its mouth to capture its prey. It eats forage fish, and occasionally squid and cuttlefish. In turn, they are preyed on by sharks, like the dusky shark, and other large bony fish. They are normally solitary. * Turbot and brill are benthic flatfish, resembling flounder and sole, but found in deeper offshore waters on the continental shelf. They are brownish-green, with dark blotches on the turbot and mottling on the brill. They are fished by coastal trawlers. File:Boreogadus saida.jpg|The polar cod is found further north than any other fish species. It frequents river mouths and feeds on plankton and krill.

Updated 2 March 2009. * Mail-cheeked fishes belong to a group of about 30 species in the order Scorpaeniformes. Mail- cheeked fishes are named after a plate of bone that runs across each cheek. They are widespread in all the oceans of the world. Mail-cheeked fishes are carnivorous, mostly feeding on crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimp, and on smaller fish. Most species live on the sea bottom in relatively shallow waters, although species are known from mid and deep water, from the mid- water, and even from fresh water. They typically have spiny heads, and rounded pectoral and caudal fins. Most species are less than in length, but the full size range of the order varies from the velvetfishes, which can be just long as adults, to the Lingcod, which can reach in length. ** Red gurnard are mail- cheeked fish. They use their large pectoral fins to rest on the bottom and to detect food. stargazer is an ambush predator which can deliver both venom and electric shocks. It has been called \\"the meanest thing in creation\\". Stargazers are about 50 species of fishes, belonging to the family Uranoscopidae, and found worldwide in shallow waters. Stargazers are venomous; they have two large poison spines situated behind the opercle and above the pectoral fins. They can also deliver electric shocks. They are ambush predators with eyes on top of their heads (thus the name). Stargazers also have a large upward-facing mouth in a large head. They bury themselves in sand with only their eyes showing, and leap upwards to ambush fish and invertebrates overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which they wiggle to attract prey's attention. Lengths range from 18 cm up to 90 cm, for the giant stargazer Kathetostoma giganteum. Stargazers are a delicacy in some cultures. The venom is destroyed when it is cooked, and stargazers are sold in some fish markets with their electric organ removed. They have been called \\"the meanest things in creation\\" and the \\"worst pet on earth\\".Grady, Denise Venom Runs Thick in Fish Families, Researchers Learn The New York Times 22 August 2006. * Sandperches are a family, Pinguipedidae, containing 63 species of fishes in the order Perciformes. They are benthic carnivores, feeding on small fish and invertebrates. Examples are the redbanded weever, yellow weaver and blue cod. They are often caught in pots like crayfish. * Medusa fishes are a family Centrolophidae of 31 species of perciform fishes. They are found in temperate and tropical waters throughout the world, usually feeding on fish, crustaceans and small squid near rough sea floors on continental shelf and slope. Examples are barrelfish, southern driftfish, imperial blackfish, the Japanese and pelagic butterfish, the New Zealand and Tasmanian ruffe, and the common, silver and white warehou. The young of some species associate with jellyfish, which provides them with protection from predators and opportunities to scavenge the remains of the jellyfish's meals. The young of other species associate with large masses of floating kelp.

It has been dated to the 1st or 2nd century BC. The fort covers , measuring from north to south and from east to west. It is surrounded by a wide earth rampart. To the north was a V-shaped ditch that was wide and deep, to the south one wide and deep. Faint traces of a second rampart or defensive terrace to the north were observed in 1959, and 19th century observers recorded the existence of a third line of ramparts and ditches, though no traces of these remain. The entrance to the fort was on the east side, though it is possible that there was originally a second entrance located on an axis with the first, as at the similar Sutton Walls Hill Fort. The site was excavated in 1959, with traces of timber revetments being found on the ramparts. The site has previously been known as \\"Danes camp field\\" and \\"Danes bury field\\" the term Berry or Bury comes from the old English \\"Burgh\\" meaning defensive position so was presumably known to the early English. There are local stories concerning King Alfred doing battle with the Danes who had been trapped in Berry Mound, excavations at the site showed signs of refortification at a later date which would fit in with this story. Nearby to the south west lies a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Berry Mound Pastures, comprising an area of 11.84 hectares (29.26 acres) of horse grazed pasture land and meadow. The site was first notified in 1994. The interest of the site lies in the diversity of the semi-natural grassland. In addition there is a stream and a small pond, and much rich flora and fauna can be found here.

According to the 2011 census, 26% of the population were born overseas and a further 20% had at least one parent born overseas. Aboriginal Australians make up approximately 2.5% of the population. Australia's diverse migrant communities have brought with them food, lifestyle and cultural practices, which have been absorbed into mainstream Australian culture. Historically, Australia adhered to the White Australia Policy. The policy was dismantled after World War II by various changes to immigration policy History Pre-Federation Prior to settlement by Europeans, the Australian continent was not a single nation, but hosted many different Aboriginal cultures and between 200 and 400 active languages at any one time. According to the 2006 census some 150 indigenous languages are still spoken. The present nation of Australia resulted from a process of immigration intended to fill the continent (also excluding poterivals to the British Empire). Settlers from the United Kingdom, after 1800 including Ireland, were the earliest people that were not native to the continent to live in Australia. Dutch colonisation and possible visits to Australia by explorers and/or traders from China, did not lead to permanent settlement. Until 1901, Australia existed as a group of independent British settler colonies.  White Australia policy: 1800s to 1972  The Immigration Restriction Act 1901, known informally as the White Australia policy, restricted non-European immigration to Australia from 1901 to 1973. The policy limited the ethnic and cultural diversity of the immigrant population. The policy was an attempt to preserve the British ethno-cultural identity of the Australian nation, promote European immigration, and to exclude persons who did not fit the European, predominately Anglo-Celtic, character of Australian society. As the twentieth century progressed and the number of migrants from the United Kingdom became insufficient to meet labour shortages, immigrants came increasingly from other parts of Europe, such as Italy, Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, and the former Yugoslavia. People whose parents were both born in Australia percentage of the population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census  Multiculturalism adopted: 1970s - Present  Following the initial moves of the Whitlam Labor government in 1973, further official national multicultural policies were implemented by Fraser's Conservative Coalition government in 1978.Mark Lopez (2000),The Origins of Multiculturalism in Australian Politics 1945‚Äì1975, Melbourne University Press, Carlton South, Victoria () The Labor Government of Bob Hawke continued with these policies during the 1980s and early 1990s, and were further supported by Paul Keating up to his electoral defeat 1996. CALD (or Culturally and Linguistually Diverse) policies continue to be implemented at all levels of government and public service, such as medical support systems which cater specifically to non-English speaking residents. The meaning of multiculturalism has been altered significantly since its formal introduction to Australia. Originally it was understood by the mainstream population as a need for acceptance that many members of the Australian community originally came from different cultures and still had ties to it.Lyle Allan (1983), 'A Selective Annotated Bibliography of Multiculturalism', in Social Alternatives (University of Queensland), Vol.3, No.3, July, page 65. However, it came to mean the rights of migrants within mainstream Australia to express their cultural identity. It is now often used to refer to the notion that people in Australia have multiple cultural or ethnic backgrounds. The overall level of immigration to Australia has grown during the last decades. Net overseas immigrants increased from 30,000 in 1993 to 118,000 in 2003‚Äì04, and 262,500 in 2016‚Äì17. According to the 2011 census, 26% of the population were born overseas, with a further 20% having at least one parent born overseas. Of the population born overseas, 82% lived in the capital cities. Aboriginal Australians make up approximately 2.5% of the population. As of 2008, Australia was ranked 18th in the world in terms of net migration per capita, ahead of Canada, the US and most of Europe. According to the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, the Australian government is concerned with three broad policy areas: cultural identity, social justice, and economic efficiency. The top ten religions in Australia account for less than 63% of the population. Terminology Members of a multicultural community who are not of Anglo-Australian background and/or not \\"assimilated\\", in that they are born elsewhere and speak another language at home, are sometimes referred to in policy discourse as culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD), particularly in Australia, where it was introduced in 1996 to replace non- English speaking background (NESB), as it goes beyond linguistic factors. The term is mostly used to \\"distinguish the mainstream community from those in which English is not the main language and/or cultural norms and values differ\\", but is not inclusive of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to whom a different set of attributes belong. Projects A number of projects by government and non-government entities have been established to facilitate multiculturalism in Australia. The capital, Canberra, has developed a tradition of holding the National Multicultural Festival, held over a week in February. There is also Harmony Day which seeks to promote a tolerant and culturally diverse society. Critique and debate Political positions In 1996, John Howard's Liberal-National Coalition was then elected to government. Howard had long been a critic of multiculturalism, releasing his One Australia policy in the late 1980s which called for a reduction in Asian immigration. He later retracted the policy, citing his then position as wrong. Shortly after the Howard government took office, a new independent member of Parliament, Pauline Hanson, made her maiden speech in which she was highly critical of multiculturalism, saying that a multicultural society could never be strong. Hanson went on to form her own political party, One Nation. One Nation campaigned strongly against official multiculturalism, arguing that it represented \\"a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values\\" and that there was \\"no reason why migrant cultures should be maintained at the expense of our shared, national culture.\\". Despite many calls for Howard to censure Hanson, his response was to state that her speech indicated a new freedom of expression in Australia on such issues, and that he believed strongly in freedom of speech. Rather than official multiculturalism, Howard advocated instead the idea of a \\"shared national identity\\", albeit one strongly grounded in certain recognisably Anglo-Celtic Australian themes, such as \\"mateship\\" and a \\"fair go\\". The name of the Department of Immigration, Multiculturalism and Indigenous Affairs was changed to the \\"Department of Immigration and Citizenship\\". However, Australia maintained a policy of multiculturalism, and government introduced expanded dual-citizenship rights.  Intellectual critique  The earliest academic critics of multiculturalism in Australia were the philosophers Lachlan ChipmanLachlan Chipman (1980), 'The Menace of Multiculturalism,' in Quadrant, Vol. 24, No. 10, October, pp. 3‚Äì6 and Frank Knopfelmacher,Frank Knopfelmacher (1982), 'The case against multi-culturalism,' in Robert Manne (ed.), The New Conservatism in Australia, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Victoria, pages 40‚Äì66 sociologist Tanya BirrellTanya Birrell (1978), 'Migration and the Dilemmas of Multiculturalism,' in Robert Birrell and Colin Hay (eds.), The Immigration Issue in Australia, A Sociological Symposium, Department of Sociology, School of Social Sciences, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, pages 132‚Äì146 and the political scientist Raymond Sestito.Raymond Sestito (1982), The Politics of Multiculturalism, The Centre for Independent Studies, Sydney, New South Wales () Chipman and Knopfelmacher were concerned with threats to social cohesion, while Birrell's concern was that multiculturalism obscures the social costs associated with large scale immigration that fall most heavily on the most recently arrived and unskilled immigrants. Sestito's arguments were based on the role of political parties. He argued that political parties were instrumental in pursuing multicultural policies, and that these policies would put strain on the political system and would not promote better understanding in the Australian community.Raymond Sestito (1982), The Politics of Multiculturalism, The Centre for Independent Studies, Sydney, New South Wales (), pages 30‚Äì36Lyle Allan (1983), 'A Selective Annotated Bibliography of Multiculturalism', in Social Alternatives (University of Queensland), Vol.3, No.3, July, page 68 Prime Minister John Curtin supported White Australia policy, saying, \\"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.\\" Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was a supporter of the White Australia Policy, and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election. > It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which > every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be > stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance > of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the > British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its > people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically > insoluble in many parts of the world. Labor leader H. V. Evatt said in 1945 at the United Nations Conference on International Organization: > You have always insisted on the right to determine the composition of your > own people. Australia wants that right now. What you are attempting to do > now, Japan attempted after the last war [the First World War] and was > prevented by Australia. Had we opened New Guinea and Australia to Japanese > immigration then the Pacific War by now might have ended disastrously and we > might have had another shambles like that experienced in Malaya. Another leader of the Labor Party, Arthur Calwell (1960-1967) supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, Be Just and Fear Not, in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote: > I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, > a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from > black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man > at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as > racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is > doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that > Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and > survive.Calwell, Be Just and Fear Not, 117 He was the last leader of ALP and Liberal parties to support it. Historian Geoffrey Blainey achieved mainstream recognition as a critic of multiculturalism when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \\"cluster of tribes\\". In his 1984 book All for Australia, Blainey criticized multiculturalism for tending to emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority population and for being \\"anti-British\\", despite the British being the largest group to have migrated to Australia. According to Blainey, such policies created divisions and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \\"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\\" and warned that \\"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\\"Blainey, Geoffrey (1984). All For Australia, North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes () In one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote: > For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, > multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social > cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military > security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their > own homelands for help. Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \\"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham.\\" Historian John Hirst argued that while multiculturalism might serve the needs of ethnic politics and the demands of certain ethnic groups for government funding for the promotion of their separate ethnic identity, it is a perilous concept on which to found national policy.John Hirst, Sense and Nonsense in Australian History, Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne (), page22 Hirst identified contradictory statements by political leaders that suggested the term was a nonsense concept. These included the policies of Prime Minister Bob Hawke, a proponent of multiculturalism while at the same time promoting a citizenship campaign and stressing the common elements of our culture,John Hirst, Sense and Nonsense in Australian History, Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne (), page23 and anti-multiculturalism statements by Prime Minister Howard, who aroused the ire of multiculturalists who thought that he was suggesting closing down Italian restaurants and prohibiting the speaking of the Italian language when he proposed no such thing. According to Hirst, multiculturalism denies the existence of a host Australian culture: > Insofar as multiculturalism makes what it calls 'Anglo-Celts' the equivalent > of Italians and Turks, it denies the very notion of a host. > [Multiculturalists assert] we are all immigrants of many cultures, > contributing to a multicultural society. This may serve the needs of ethnic > politics. As a serious historical or sociological analysis it is nonsense. > To found policy on it may be perilous. Critics have argued that multiculturalism was introduced as official policy in Australia without public support or consultation. According to academic Mark Lopez: \\"Multiculturalism was developed by a small number of academics, social workers and activists, initially located on the fringe of the political arena of immigration, settlement and welfare. The authors responsible for versions of the ideology were also principal actors in the struggle to advance their beliefs and make them government policy\\". Lopez asserts that through \\"core groups and activists' sympathisers and contacts ... multiculturalism became government policy ... because the multiculturalists and their supporters were able to influence the ideological content of the Minister's sources of policy ... Contemporary public opinion polls implied ... in the general population, a widespread resentment, or a lack of interest, of the kinds of ideas advanced by multiculturalists. ... The original constituency for multiculturalism was small; popular opinion was an obstacle, not an asset, for the multiculturalists.\\" Furthermore, according to Lopez: \\"Multiculturalism was not simply picked up and appreciated and implemented by policy makers, government and the major political parties ... [I]n every episode that resulted in the progress of multiculturalism, the effectiveness of the political lobbyists was a decisive factor. ... [Multiculturalism was] tirelessly promoted and manoeuvered forward\\". However, the above argument have been contested by others, who note that \\"Government sponsored conferences were in fact held at least once a year from 1950 to discuss immigration issues and to provide information for both government and the Australian public\\". Critics associated with the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University have argued that both Right and Left factions in the Australian Labor Party have adopted a multicultural stance for the purposes of increasing their support within the party.Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches - The Balkanisation of Labor,' in People and Place Vol.1, No.4, Pages 37‚Äì43 A manifestation of this embrace of multiculturalism has been the creation of ethnic branches within the Labor Party and ethnic branch stacking.Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches - The Balkanisation of Labor,' in People and Place Vol.1, No.4, Pages 37 Following the upsurge of support for the One Nation Party in 1996, Lebanese-born Australian anthropologist Ghassan Hage published a critique in 1997 of Australian multiculturalism in the book White Nation.\\"Hage, G. (1997) White Nation: Fantasies of White supremacy in a multicultural society, Annandale, NSW: Pluto Press ()\\" Drawing on theoretical frameworks from Whiteness studies, Jacques Lacan and Pierre Bourdieu, Hage examined a range of everyday discourses that implicated both anti-multiculturalists and pro- multiculturalists alike. In exploring the discourse of multiculturalism others have argued that the threat to social cohesion and national identity have been overstated. For instance, Ramakrishan (2013) argues that the \\"largely European\\" cultural traditions of the population have been maintained despite greater ethnic diversity. Others have asserted that the emphasis on notions such as 'Identity, citizenship, social cohesion and integration' serves more as a catchphrase rather than pragmatic attempts to address the given issues. Kerkyasharian (2008) argues: > Of course, most of the debate over multiculturalism has nothing to do with > actual government policies or laws on cultural diversity. Detractors have no > viable policy alternative, other than the imposition of a nebulous set of > 'Australian values'. When pressed to define these values, they will usually > cite some broad principles, such as fairness, equality and so on. All well > and good ‚Äì because multiculturalism stands for these same principles.

The formation of the cabinet was supervised by Vladimir Dekanozov, deputy of Vyacheslav Molotov and a close associate of Lavrentiy Beria, who selected Justas Paleckis as the Prime Minister and acting President. The government was formed on June 17 and, together with the People's Seimas (parliament), transitioned independent Lithuania to a socialist republic and the 14th republic of the Soviet Union thus legitimizing the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. The People's Government was replaced by the Council of People's Commissars of the Lithuanian SSR on August 25. Similar transitional People's Governments were formed in Latvia (Prime Minister Augusts Kirhen≈°teins supervised by Andrey Vyshinsky) and Estonia (Prime Minister Johannes Vares supervised by Andrei Zhdanov). Formation The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. The Baltic states became part of the Russian sphere. Instead of outright military invasion, the Soviet Union followed semi-legal procedures to legitimize its occupation of Lithuania. The plan of action was developed by the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in September‚ÄìOctober 1939 when the Soviet Union annexed territories of Poland.Senn (2007), p. 125 The first step was the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of October 1939: Lithuania agreed to station up to 20,000 Soviet troops in exchange for a portion of the Vilnius Region. Next was the Soviet ultimatum of June 14, 1940 that demanded the formation of a new government more capable of adhering to the Mutual Assistance Pact and to allow a \\"sufficiently large\\" number of Soviet troops to enter Lithuanian territory. The Lithuanian government debated the response to the ultimatum on the night of June 13-14 and decided to accept it unconditionally because effective military resistance against a much larger Red Army was virtually impossible. During the debate, Prime Minister Antanas Merkys resigned, making way for General Stasys Ra≈°tikis, who was previously given tacit approval by Vyacheslav Molotov. However, Ra≈°tikis was not approved by Molotov and Merkys continued as acting Prime Minister. Vladimir Dekanozov was dispatched from Moscow to oversee formation of an acceptable government. President Antanas Smetona, fearing Soviet persecutions, fled to Nazi Germany and later Switzerland. Before leaving, he transferred presidential duties to Merkys, as per the Constitution. A day later, however, Merkys announced on national radio that he had deposed Smetona and was now president in his own right. On the morning of June 16, the Lithuanian government decided that Smetona's departure was in effect a resignation and granted full presidential powers to Merkys, while Kazys Bizauskas became acting Prime Minister. At the same time, Minister of Defence Kazys Musteikis, who fled to Germany with Smetona, was replaced by Vincas Vitkauskas. It appears that the Lithuanians were acting on their own accord and that Dekanozov was not involved in making this transition.Senn (2007), pp. 108‚Äì109 On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis as the new Prime Minister and confirmed a new cabinet, which became known as the People's Government. Merkys then resigned. Paleckis ascended to the presidency, and appointed writer Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius as Prime Minister. Scholars continue to debate whether the successive changes in the government were constitutional. While care was given to observe constitutional formalities as much as possible, the changes were made under duress and under the influence of a foreign occupying power. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990, it took the line that since Smetona never resigned, Merkys and Paleckis had no claim to the presidency, and therefore all acts leading up to the Soviet takeover were void. Membership In the first days of occupation, Dekanozov focused the public's attention on the \\"cowardly\\" flight of Smetona and portrayed the changes in Lithuania as the destruction of his authoritarian regime. The public was told that the Soviets would protect and respect Lithuanian independence. Lithuanian activists, including Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius, claimed that they believed the Soviets and had hopes to restore democratic Lithuania as it existed prior to the 1926 coup. In the meantime, Dekanozov worked to recruit a sympathetic but non-communist government that could be easily manipulated into implementing various sovietization policies.Senn (2007), p. 127 Indeed, none of the first ministers of the People's Government were communists. The fact that the Soviets did not immediately install a communist government calmed people's nerves.Senn (2007), p. 128 In addition, the Communist Party of Lithuania, which had been outlawed and persecuted in independent Lithuania, was small, weak, and not yet ready for the job of running a government. Moscow also considered it unreliable due to suspected influence of Trotskyism among its ranks.Senn (2007), p. 137 For Prime Minister, Dekanozov selected a known leftist journalist and fellow traveler Justas Paleckis. Later, in his memoirs, Paleckis claimed that the offer came as a complete surprise. Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius, a writer, was selected for the second most important post. He gave the new government a desired public image.Senn (2007), p. 142 He became perhaps the most controversial figure of the People's Government. He was the first to voice his objections to incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. On July 1, after an in- person meeting with Molotov, Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius submitted his resignation, but Paleckis refused it. He then took an extended vacation and was replaced by communist Meƒçislovas Gedvilas. Ernestas Galvanauskas remained as Minister of Finance. Having served as Prime Minister twice, Galvanauskas was an established political leader and opponent of Smetona's regime. General Vincas Vitkauskas was a veteran of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and Klaipƒóda Revolt. The government thus appeared to be left-leaning but non-communist. Activities On June 17, six initial members of the new government were sworn in. Paleckis was unprepared for the role as Prime Minister and had little idea of what he should be doing. However, the very next day, he announced a government program, apparently handed to him by Dekanozov. The program denounced Smetona's regime and stressed friendly relationship with the Soviet Union. In internal matters, the program called for disbandment of the Fourth Seimas (the parliament), release of political prisoners (many of them communists), reforms in education and healthcare. The program made no mention of far-reaching social and economic reforms needed to convert Lithuania into a socialist republic.

It was opened in the mid-19th century and expanded since then. Graves from other, smaller burial grounds around Le Roy have been added. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, one of two cemeteries in Genesee County with that distinction. It was originally built and laid out as a rural cemetery, with a parklike setting on the banks of Oatka Creek. In the early 20th century its design philosophy changed, when a large mausoleum to local businessman Orator Francis Woodward, who in his last years made a fortune developing Jell-O into a bestselling dessert, was built in the southern section of the cemetery near his factory. The architect hired by the family to lay out the section was influenced by the City Beautiful movement, giving that area a more orderly cast. Note: This includes , Supplemental Documentation, and Accompanying five photographs Woodward's monument, visible from the cemetery's main entrance, is the most prominent of many notable graves in the cemetery. Other structures within include a memorial chapel built around the same time and a granite vault held together by its own weight. The markers exhibit a variety of materials, forms and styles of funerary art. Among the 5,500 dead buried here besides Woodward and his family are many people important to the history of Le Roy, including the daughters of its namesake, the inventor of Jell-O and Sarah Frances Whiting, an astronomer who was also one of the first to experiment with X-rays. Veterans of every American war lie at Machpelah as well. Buildings and grounds The cemetery is located on a parcel near the northern boundary of the village of Le Roy. Its western boundary is the irregular, curving Oatka Creek. On the south is the large, empty factory that once manufactured Jell-O when it was all produced in Le Roy. To the east, across North Street, are houses, and residential property continues to the north, into the Town of Le Roy. A wrought iron fence runs along the south and east sides. At the three main entrances, and the southeast and northeast corners, are two limestone pillars topped with stone orbs. The southern third of the cemetery is generally flat, with axial roads radiating outward from the Woodward mausoleum near the southeast entrance. In the northern and central portions, the landscape becomes hillier, with a gentle descent to the creek. The roads there curve with the landscape. Throughout, the cemetery is planted with mature trees and shrubs from a variety of species. There are three buildings on the cemetery grounds. The most prominent is the mausoleum of Orator Francis Woodward, the Le Roy resident who built a personal fortune from buying the patent for Jell-O. It is a small stone Classical Revival structure in the middle of a circle with large planted myrtles at the end of the short drive from the main entrance, serving as its focal point. The east (front) elevation has four Doric columns in front of bronze doors, and a similar colonnade on the west (rear) with a stained glass window. Its interior is paneled in marble. Interred there are Woodward, his wife Cora and their six children. To the south of the main drive is the smaller Lampson mausoleum. It is built of panels of New Hampshire granite locked together by their own weight. Scottish variegated granite columns are on the north (front) elevation. Between them are marble doors opening into a chamber with a marble mosaic floor. alt=A light brown stone chapel with a projecting front, red door and steep roof with a cross on top Downhill from the drive at the northern entrance, the former main entrance, is the Lathrop Chapel, at the end of a parkway with plantings and a veterans' memorial. It is a vernacular Gothic limestone building with a slate roof. On its front is a portico with two lancet windows framing the entrance. Above is a double pointed-arch window with a Celtic cross at the roof. All three are contributing resources to the cemetery's historic character. There is one other building, a modern cemetery office and garage just south of the main entrance. Due to its recent construction it is non- contributing. There are 5,500 decedents buried at 6,500 graves in the cemetery's ten sections. They date from the time of the cemetery's founding to the present, and include a variety of funerary art from the times they were erected. They take a variety of forms, from traditional gravestones to obelisks, and use a variety of stones from granite and marble to green serpentine. Among the notable markers are another one to the Woodwards. It is a large semicircle of pink Canadian granite, long and 10¬Ω feet () deep with a paved terrace. On either side are curved benches with a small flower garden in the center around a rectangular stone. Many members of the Olmsted family, prominent from Le Roy's early days, also have distinctive markers. The obelisk of John Randolph Olmsted is the tallest monument in the cemetery, and Chauncey Olmsted and his family also are memorialized with a large red granite obelisk atop a hill. John Barlow Olmsted's green serpentine stone, amid a grove of cedars, has a history of the family. Some markers have distinctive decoration. Artist Frank Eastman Jones' stone has a carved palette. On the south knoll of the cemetery's west side are the graves of the three Bang children, outlined with low marble stones that resemble cribs when seen at a distance. A fourth Bang child has a nearby grave with a detailed carved cross decorated with ivy and flowers. Another descendant of a prominent local family, Sheldon Francis Bartow, has a large marble urn embellished with garlands on his stone. The white marble angel praying at the Paul family plot is the largest statue in the cemetery. Other distinct funerary art include the Greek letters Alpha and Omega (A and Œ©) on the three Whiting graves and the Avilan crosses on the graves of Polly and Esther Barrows. History The cemetery went through two phases of development. From its establishment to the end of the 19th century, it remained true to its conception as a rural cemetery. After the construction of the Woodward Mausoleum in the early years of the 20th, subsequent development was influenced by the contemporary City Beautiful movement. 1801‚Äì1858: Conception and construction Le Roy's first burying ground had been established in 1801, within three years of its settlement. Gradually seven other small graveyards came into being around the community's churches as it grew due to settlement of the Holland Purchase lands in the surrounding area and its location at the junction of Oatka Creek and a major road (now New York State Route 5) through the area. All were small, meant mainly for the churches' congregants. The first rural cemetery, Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts, was established in 1831. The idea of burying the dead in a large, parklike tract with walking paths and plantings took some time to gain acceptance. Seven years later, in 1838, Rochester's Mount Hope Cemetery became the first rural cemetery in Western New York, and the first one to be operated by a municipality. George Blodgett, a veteran of the War of 1812 and local businessman, may have been similarly inspired by the idea. He proposed that an eight-acre () tract near the northwest corner of the village be acquired for a rural cemetery. At first he tried to finance the purchase through the sale of plots for $25 ($ in contemporary dollars), but grew discouraged after he had only sold 20 in several years. 1858‚Äì1906: Rural cemetery period Blodgett turned to another prominent Le Roy citizen, Chauncey Olmsted, who would later be buried in the cemetery. Olmsted gave him $200, which made it possible to purchase the land from a local wheat farmer. Under Blodgett's supervision, Olmsted built the original fences and walkways. The Rev. Samuel Cox, first chancellor of Ingham University, suggested the name Machpelah, from Jacob's exhortation at Genesis 49:30: \\"Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephrom the Hittite, the cave in the field of Machpelah ...\\" The first decedent, twelve-year-old Caro Frances Chamberlin, was buried on the last day of 1858. Her grave is extant, atop the southern knoll in section B, Lot 16. Blodgett built the public vault into the hill near what is now the parkway leading to the Lathrop Chapel. Its limestone facade was copied soon after for a nearby family vault. In 1870 the heirs of Miles Lampson, one of the wealthiest men in the village, built the granite mausoleum to him. Originally it was surrounded by a decorative iron fence. It was built by a Connecticut company for a reported cost of $10,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). Later in that decade the cemetery grew when one of Le Roy's original burying grounds were closed down and the bodies moved. After the original Episcopal church was demolished, the bodies in its graveyard were divided between two other cemeteries. Among those moved to Machpelah were Julia and Caroline Le Roy, daughters of the community's namesake, Jacob Le Roy. Ownership of the cemetery was formally transferred in 1873 from Blodgett to the Machpelah Cemetery Association. The following year Blodgett died, and the cemetery was formally consecrated. At the ceremony one speaker, Lucius Bangs, praised the cemetery's rural setting and its soothing effect: Similar praise found its way into print in subsequent years. \\"The grounds are upon an elevation and are beautifully laid out with an excellent taste displayed in adapting new ideas to the laying out and beautifying of burial plots, which is worthy of imitation.\\" wrote the Genesee County Gazetteer in 1890. Two decades later, in 1913, the Le Roy Gazette said: With the new century the cemetery acquired a fence. The initial was installed along the east side by a Detroit company for $36.60 ($ in contemporary dollars) in 1903. Later that decade, the cemetery association bought the property to the south and, in 1907, the Woodward Mausoleum was built. Afterwards, the southern boundary was fenced off and by late 1908 the limestone pillars at the gates and corners were in place. 1906‚Äìpresent: City Beautiful alt=A brown stone building with a pointed roof and four columns in front in the middle of a paved circle and shrubbery. Across the top it says \\"Woodward\\". Orator Francis Woodward's burial in the cemetery marked a change in design philosophies. He had made his Jell-O fortune in the last years of his life; his family put it to many philanthropic uses not only in Le Roy but in the greater Rochester area as well. His mausoleum was one of the first in the southern section, and the Woodward family retained landscape architect Alling Deforest, who had designed the gardens around the George Eastman House in Rochester, to design the surrounding landscape. The roads radiating from the circular drive around the mausoleum impart clean, clear visual lines and symmetry to the landscape, in contrast to the meandering, idiosyncratic rural atmosphere of the older sections. This reflects the ideals of the contemporary City Beautiful movement, with a preference for symmetry and order in public spaces, particularly since this section directly abuts the factory where Woodward had made his fortune. It is augmented by the Classical Revival style of the mausoleum at the center of the Deforest-designed portion, the architect of which is not known. Deforest was also able to make a smooth transition between the newer and older sections and their different styles. In 1910 the Union Free School in the village needed to expand and acquired the former Ingham University campus. Members of the Ingham family who had been buried there were moved to a small plot in Machpelah, along with the white marble obelisk memorializing Emily Ingham's husband Col. Phineas Staunton, who died on an expedition to South America and is buried in Ecuador. Also that year, the Lathrop Chapel, designed by Robert Fayfield of Buffalo, was erected. It is built into the hillside to allow its basement to be used as a vault. There have been no significant additions to the cemetery since then. The chapel underwent several renovations at mid-century. In 1950 Helen Woodward Rivas, Orator's youngest daughter, paid for the first. Three years later, the Rev. Raymond Calkins funded additional work in memory of his wife's family, the Lathrops, giving the chapel its name. Among those renovations were a stained glass rose window; however it was replaced with the current window, depicting the Resurrection of Jesus as described at Matthew 28:1-6, six years later when Calkins objected to the rose window. Notable burials A number of locally prominent people, some who also achieved national renown, are buried in Machpelah: *Frank Eastman Jones, an artist whose grave marker has a carved palette. *Janet DeMallie Boehme, She was the face of Eastman Kodak for decades, her husband Robert A \\"Bob\\" Boehme is next to her. *Calvin Keeney, a village resident who invented the stringless bean. *William Lampson, a local bank president who was the wealthiest man in the village when he died in 1897. His funeral vault is the only extant building of many he had constructed. *Joshua Lathrop, Le Roy's first mayor (the position was called village president at the time). *Jacob Le Roy's daughters Caroline and Julia, both of whom died in childhood, are the only members of the family buried in the village which bears their father's name. Their graves were among those moved into Machpelah later on. *Pearle Bixby Wait, the actual inventor of Jell-O. *Sarah Frances Whiting, an Ingham alumna who became an astronomer and was one of the first to experiment with X-rays. *Donald Woodward, Orator's youngest son. He was an aviation pioneer who built the local airport and owned the Friendship, the plane Amelia Earhart flew across the Atlantic. *Ernest Woodward, Orator's oldest son. He sold Jell-O to Postum for $66 million, the beginning of General Foods. With the money he supported local institutions, and even paid for some of the cost of the local post office. *Orator Francis Woodward, The owner of the Genesee Pure Food Company. He bought the Jell-O patent from Wait in 1899 and died a millionaire seven years later. *Nancy Van Doren, One of the founders of Washington State University, 1891. Almost 400 war veterans are buried at Machpelah. They represent all wars, starting with three from Revolutionary War moved to Machpelah later in the 19th century. In 2006 the Le Roy Historical Society began putting flags on their graves, a practice the local American Legion post had discontinued in the 1980s due to lack of funds. It is part of a society project to update the records of the veterans buried at the cemetery.

Two masked men opened fire into a coffee bar, killing six young Serb men, five of whom were teenagers, and wounding 15.Kosovo: the road to war On 14 December Serbian police ambushed KLA smuggling weapons and supplies from Albania. The Panda Bar attack appeared as a reprisal, and broke the brief cease-fire between the Albanian and Serbian forces during the Kosovo War. The KLA did not accept responsibility.  Timeline Within hours of the border ambush, the KLA vowed revenge. That evening, suspected KLA gunmen entered a Serb-owned caf√© in Peƒá and opened fire on the patrons, killing six Serb youths. The victims were a 14-year-old, a 16-year-old, three 17-year-olds and one 25-year-old. Western diplomats suspected that the attack was carried out by the KLA in retribution for the ambush. The KLA denied responsibility; the journalist Tim Judah suggests that the attack may have been carried out by a rogue unit. The shooting appalled foreign emissaries, and at a meeting with Milo≈°eviƒá the following day, Holbrooke condemned it as an act of terrorism and described the situation in Kosovo as \\"very grave\\". Milo≈°eviƒá issued a separate statement accusing the international community of failing to prevent attacks on Serb civilians, stating: \\"The terrorist gangs have not ceased attacking the army, the police, and inhabitants of Kosovo.\\" The attack led to an immediate crackdown on the Albanian-populated southern quarters of Peƒá ‚Äì Kape≈°nica and Zatra. The area was sealed off, and houses were searched systematically. Media reports stated that Serbian police killed two Kosovo Albanians during the operation. The OSCE later made a report on the event and its aftermath, calling it the Panda Bar incident. Several Albanians were arrested and found guilty of the crime. They were released one month after sentencing with the intermediation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Several of them were tortured in prison according to Albanian newspapers. The grave stones of the victims have been destroyed. An investigation was started in 2011. Lately, Serbian newspapers have reported claims of both foreign and Serbian special forces involvement, which has been denied.

Founded in 1870 it is Israel's oldest winery, as well as its fourth largest. History Originally called Efrat, the winery was founded in 1870 by Avraham Teperberg and his son, Zeev Zaid Teperberg. The name was based on the biblical \\"Efrata shehi Beit Lechem\\", the road by which the grapes were brought to the winery. It was first established in the Old City of Jerusalem. When Zeev Teperberg died in 1905, his son, Mordechai Shimon, took over the management. The Mandate government ruled that all \\"industries\\" had to leave the Old City of Jerusalem, so the winery moved outside the city walls to various locations. In 1950, Mordechai's sons Menachem and Yitzhak established another winery in Nahalat Yitzhak. When Yitzhak died in 1960, Menachem continued to manage the family winery on his own. In 1964, Menachem purchased land in Motza, just outside Jerusalem, to accommodate the growing business. A modern winery was established there in 1967. Starting in 2002 the winery began an effort to make more sophisticated wines, moved to kibbutz Tzora, and changed its name to Teperberg 1870.

It opened in 1823 and contains over 8,000 graves, mostly from the 19th century. In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first of two cemeteries in Genesee County to be so designated. The first graves were some of the city's early settlers, moved from another graveyard that had become too full. Originally it was run by nearby St. James Episcopal Church, but when the cemetery became too big an independent Batavia Cemetery Association was formed. It has operated the cemetery ever since. Joseph Ellicott, the agent for the Holland Land Company, who shaped Western New York in its early years and laid out the cities of Batavia and Buffalo, is buried under a large monument. Other notable markers commemorate Anti-Masonic activist William Morgan, American Fourierist Albert Brisbane and his son Arthur, a prominent newspaper editor in the yellow journalism era; Civil War General John H. Martindale and New York Central Railroad president Dean Richmond. Other notable burials include some local congressmen. Grounds The cemetery is located on the east side of Harvester, a block south of East Main Street (New York state routes 5 and 33). It is an irregularly shaped parcel bordered by an active rail spur on the south and an abandoned rail right-of-way on the north. The terrain is generally level with a small rise in the middle of the property. There are over 8,000 burials in 629 separate plots. On the north is a residential neighborhood dominated by two-story wood frame houses from the 20th century. The portion of the right-of-way on the northwest is used as an unpaved parking area. Across Harvester is a large four-story brick industrial building. South of the railroad tracks is an area of mixed commercial and industrial use, with another large industrial complex served by the rail spur on the southeast. A cast iron Italianate fence runs along the street side. It has simple spiked pickets between larger posts decorated with chamfered corners and floral rosettes. They are complemented by modern chainlink fences on the south and east; a row of Eastern Hemlock shrubs sets off the right-of-way at the northwest corner. All vehicular access to the cemetery is via the double-leaf gates in the fence along Harvester. The main gate is in the center, with the cemetery's main internal access road leading due east from it to the rear corner. Secondary roads, most in the process of growing over, branch out from it at intervals. alt=A one-story yellow wooden building with a pointed roof held up by columns at the front and a small addition on the left in a cemetery. In the front is a wooden door with \\"1823\\" on it. It is autumn, and the ground and roof are covered with yellow fallen leaves. A tree with yellow leaves and an American flag are visible in the background Along that road in the center of the cemetery is the only building, a small one-story one-bay maintenance shed, originally built as a bank and moved to the cemetery later. It is a Greek Revival structure with paired Doric columns and pilasters at the corners supporting a pedimented roof. The north (front) elevation is sided in clapboard; the others have flushboard. There is a small closet size wing on the east. A six-paneled wooden door in the middle of the front is the only entrance; there are no windows. It is considered a contributing property to the listing on the National Register. alt=A reddish- brown stone building with a pointy roof, a cross on the front and a round- arched front door with the word \\"RICHMOND\\" carved into the stone above it, seen on an autumn day with filtered sunshine coming from the right and yellow leaves falling in front. Richmond Mausoleum A gate near the south end of the fence is no longer in use; the road from it is overgrown. Two gates near the northwest corner lead to a short semicircular drive with a large cast iron urn in the middle of its lawn. At its east end is the only mausoleum in the cemetery, the final resting place of Dean Richmond, a Batavia native who rose to become president of the New York Central Railroad. There are no other monuments or markers in the surrounding area. It is a red granite High Victorian structure in the form of a high gableed nave with lower flanking shed-roofed catacombs topped by , granite slabs. The middle section of the roof is raised further; its sides and the gable apexes have large quatrefoils. A small set of steps on the west (front) end has a semicircular tympanum supported by four colonettes of smooth granite with carved cushioned capitals. Atop are voussoirs of alternating dark and light stone. A dentilled cornice runs around the perimeter above; on the west the name \\"Richmond\\" is carved just above it in the entablature. At the very top of the west facade is a stone cross. Other monuments and markers Two other decedents are commemorated with significant memorials, both in the form of tall pillars. Just southwest of the maintenance shed in the middle of the cemetery is a obelisk at the gravesite of Joseph Ellicott. An inscription recounts his accomplishments in developing the region as the agent for the Holland Land Company in the early decades of the 19th century. At the southwest corner of the cemetery is a granite pillar with a statue of William Morgan atop it. A four-part inscription on all sides praises Morgan for his heroism in attempting to expose the secrets of Freemasonry and explains how the monument was funded with donations from Canada and 26 U.S. states and territories. Morgan is actually not buried there; he disappeared in 1824. There are many other obelisks, many located in the south central portion near Ellicott's. Most are in a classical mode, with the Gothic cross on the grave of David Evans, Ellicott's nephew, a notable exception. The majority of the graves have markers typical of the 19th century, from simple marble headstones for the earlier graves to more Romantic markers later on with a wide variety of motifs in their funerary art. There are also polished granite markers from the early 20th century, and one of white zinc. alt=A general view of the Batavia Cemetery featuring a family plot surrounded by a decorative iron fence. The plot features a large obelisk grave marker. It is autumn, and the ground is covered with yellow fallen leaves. History Batavia's first graveyard, the West Main Street Cemetery, was established in 1806, in the first years of settlement. Since it was next to Tonawanda Creek, which frequently flooded, it soon became apparent that a better location was needed. The decedents were removed to the new Batavia Cemetery, established in 1823 on what was the eastern edge of the village. A former bank building was moved from Ebenezer, near Buffalo, to serve as the maintenance shed. The original 88 plots were laid out in a grid, with the feet of the dead intended to face east, toward the rising sun. Additional land was purchased in 1829 and 1841. Eight years later, in 1849, the cemetery got its first large monument. Joseph Ellicott, a resident who as agent for the Holland Land Company had overseen and planned the settlement of what is now Western New York, had taken his own life in New York City in 1826 and was buried there. Almost a quarter-century after his death his sister Rachel Evans arranged for his body to be reburied in the city he had founded, with a large monument inscribed with an account of his life and work. More land was added to the cemetery three years later, in 1852. The Ellicott monument was exceeded in scale after the Civil War by the mausoleum of Dean Richmond, who had parlayed his railroad holdings into the presidency of the New York Central Railroad from 1864 until his death two years later. His widow spent $28,000 ($ in contemporary funds) having it built in 1869. It faced the line then used by the Central's main competitor, the Erie. In the cemetery's early years, two churches, St. James Episcopal and the First Congregational Society (later the First Presbyterian Church) were the joint owners of the cemetery. Despite the land purchases and some other improvements, maintenance of the cemetery as a whole was unsatisfactory for the plot owners. They joined together in 1880 and incorporated as the Batavia Cemetery Association, which has owned and operated it ever since. alt=A tall stone monument behind a chainlink fence in a cemetery. A tall gray round column with a statue of a man atop sits on a darker pedestal Two years later, in 1882, an organization called the National Christian Association Opposed to Secret Societies called attention to William Morgan, a Batavia resident who, after a failed bid to join the local Masonic Lodge, began speaking and writing against the order and its alleged hidden influence on society and politics. His 1826 disappearance,In 1881, workers at a quarry in nearby Pembroke found remains with artifacts that indicated they might be Morgan's. supposedly after an abduction, helped catalyze the formation of an Anti-Masonic Party. The Association shared his sentiments, and proposed that a memorial be built to him. With $20,000 ($ in contemporary funds) raised from supporters all over the United States and Canada, the monument was built in 1882. It was placed near the street and the New York Central main line to maximize its public visibility. By that time, the Richmond mausoleum was beginning to show signs of structural failure. In 1886, Mrs. Richmond paid another $12,000 ($ in contemporary funds) to have it dismantled, rebuilt and expanded. A total of of granite were brought to Batavia from Westerly, Rhode Island, for the new mausoleum, including 10-inch-thick () floor blocks. The last significant land acquisition came in 1915, bringing the cemetery to its present shape and size. In the early 1950s the Central built a new main line south of the city, routing most rail traffic away from the Morgan monument. Both those tracks and the Erie's eventually became part of Conrail when the private railroads failed in the early 1970s; the former Erie tracks were removed. In 1998 one of the neighboring companies, which owns the right-of-way, transferred a stretch near the cemetery's northeast corner to it for future expansion. Notable burials alt=A stone obelisk and grave marker inside a low black fence in the middle of a cemetery. The obelisk is on an ornate square pedestal with a green metal plaque on it.
