It has well-spaced pseudobulbs each with a single grooved leaf and cluster of small, red or orange flowers with a hairy labellum. It grows on trees and rocks sometimes in rainforest but also on trees in cleared paddocks, and is endemic to eastern Australia. Description Bulbophyllum schillerianum is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with stems long hanging for most of their length and covered with greyish bracts. The pseudobulbs are long, about wide and spaced apart along the stems. Each pseudobulb has a thick, fleshy, narrow oblong to lance-shaped leaf long and wide with a channelled upper surface. Red or orange flowers long and wide are arranged in groups of up to ten on a flowering stem long. The sepals and petals are fleshy, the sepals long, wide and the petals about long and wide. The labellum is brown, about long and wide with hairy edges and a sharp bend near the middle. Flowering occurs from March to August. Taxonomy and naming Bulbophyllum schillerianum was first formally described in 1993 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach who published the description in Hamburg Garten- und Blumenzeitung. The type specimen was grown in \\"Herrn Consul Schiller's\\" garden, grown by \\"Herrn Stange\\". Distribution and habitat The red rope orchid grows on rainforest trees and mangroves, on boulders, near stream banks, on rocks and sometimes on trees remaining in cleared paddocks. It is found between the Cedar Bay National Park in Queensland and the Hunter River in New South Wales.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 20, 1974, due to its architectural significance. History The Gates‚ÄìDaves House stands on a portion of a Spanish land grant deeded to Antonio Espejo during Mobile's colonial period. In 1841 the property was purchased by Hezekiah Gates from Charles Dellinger for $3500, local tradition maintains that the house was constructed that same year. Gates's widow, Adele then sold the house to Camellia Bull in 1850 and she in turn sold to Thomas K. Daves in 1856. Architectural characteristics The house is a wood-frame structure on low brick piers. It originally comprised a main block measuring wide and deep, with projecting rear wings. The rear portion was remodeled in the 20th century. The unaltered front portion features a seven bay facade with French doors set into each bay, the central door is surrounded by sidelights and a transom window.

Playing career Toma≈°eviƒá was one of the best forwards in the Belgrade clubs in the period before the World War II, the star player of BASK, national team striker and an excellent manager. He started playing in 1925 in Jedinstvo Belgrade. In 1928 moved to SK Soko and a year later the club was renamed into BASK where he'll stay for eleven years, until 1940, when because of a serious lesion of the meniscus, had to stop playing. He is remembered as an excellent technician and a very effective striker. National team Beside 23 matches for the Belgrade City selection, and one match for the Yugoslav B team, Toma≈°eviƒá played 12 matches for the Yugoslavia national football team having scored 8 goals. He mostly played as a striker or left midfielder. His debut was in Belgrade on 15 March 1931 against Greece (4-1 win) having scored a hat-trick. There was a darker period in his national team career that happened after in a match for the Balkan Cup, in Sofia against Bulgaria (2-3 loss), he failed to materialize a penalty and was afterward absent from the national side for three years! His comeback was in a Balkan Cup realized in Athens in 1935 and was a perfect opportunity for him to demonstrate the unfairness of his absence, having shown great condition and scored three goals in two matches that much helped his side to win the tournament, whereas Toma≈°eviƒá himself was the best scorer (along with Tirnaniƒá with 3 goals each). His last match was on 22 May 1938 in a friendly match against Italy in Genoa (0-4 loss).

He was the main coach of Sarajevo's FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar, Ljubljana's clubs Krim and Odred, Vardar Skopje and Partizan Belgrade but his main achievements were the two national cups with Red Star Belgrade, one national championship with Hajduk Split and winning the promotion to the First League with Radniƒçki Beograd.

They also televise the regional championships, which precede the Little League World Series.  Broadcast history  The ABC television network began televising a tape-delayed Little League World Series Championship Game on an annual basis in 1963. From 1965 to 1985, the championship game was broadcast during the weekend, airing under ABC's Wide World of Sports umbrella. In 1982, Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) began expanding their cable television network through increased coverage of sports entertainment on a global scale. During this time, ESPN's brand and its family of networks, began covering the Little League World Series games in a greater capacity. A total of 12 games were televised by the network in 2000, resulting in nationwide popularity of the game, which provided opportunities to expand the total number of teams from eight to 16. In 2001, ESPN covered all eight U.S. regional championships. This was as a result of a second stadium, Volunteer Stadium, which allowed games to take place simultaneously. Also that year, ABC began televising the U.S. Championship Game. That year, ESPN aired a total of 25 games. In 2003, ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 carried a total of 35 games including regional championships. All games aired on any ESPN network are also available via Internet streaming on ESPN3. One of the most prominent announcers was Harold Reynolds. Former major league baseball player and color commentator Tony Gwynn referred to him as \\"the Pied Piper of Little League baseball.\\" Some of the game broadcasters and play-by-play commentators have included sportscasters Al Michaels and Brent Musburger, American sports journalist Jim McKay, and former major league baseball players Cy Young Award and World Series MVP Orel Hershiser, and Hall of Fame baseball players Johnny Bench, Mickey Mantle and Jim Palmer.  Programming successes  The Poynter Institute was hired by ESPN to write about their programming, from an outsider's perspective. This blog became known as The Poynter Review Project. The report concludes that the Little League World Series is a good thing for ESPN, fans, and the players. The Poynter Review Project stated that there was no reason for ESPN to shy away from the fact that the kids were crying. The project maintained that crying is actually a healthy emotion, and one that boys at this age should feel comfortable expressing. Adults should use those opportunities to reinforce that these emotions are normal and healthy responses to such a moment of either disappointment or achievement. Furthermore, the project asserted that not crying during such moments is actually an unhealthy response. The project also found no evidence that these boys develop mental health issues later on in life as a result of playing in this tournament, maintaining a variety of reasons to enjoy watching these young athletes compete at the highest level. ESPN has now gone away from trying to show kids crying due to the previous criticism they received from viewers.  Programming concerns  While there has been documented successes of the Little Leagues World Series, there have also been detractors of the sports program that believe that there is too much exposure for the Little League World Series, especially the effect it has on the participants. ESPN's Tim Scanlon defended the network's coverage, \\"We're not trying to hide or patronize the coverage... but you don't want to sensationalize those moments. It's about the experience and the competition. It's pure. It's almost innocent.\\" ;Exploitation of children Bill Plaschke is a Los Angeles Times sports writer who also contributes to ESPN from time to time. He has written an article about the exploitation witnessed during a televised game of the Little League World Series. He describes in detail situations, such as children pouting in an attempt to hold themselves together in tough situations, parents yelling at the players, all which is aired in what can be perceived as an exploitation of their situations, for which there are many examples of in television. Plaschke says the blame is not on the networks, but on the Little League itself because if ESPN or ABC did not show the games then some other network would. Plaschke also said we just don't need to see it, and they don't need us to see it. Cameras do not help already tense situations, arbitrarily deter from what matters, and unjustly exploit. The cameras change everything for kids who just aren't ready for it. He brings up the point that no other league exploits their kids at such an early age. Most of these kids are between the age of 11-12. The earliest you see football and basketball stars are High school, and you cannot see hockey stars till college. A lot of this may have to do with popularity, and money, but that is why Plaschke blames the League the most for this. The pressures of these kids mirror those of a major league baseball team on any given day. On most days these kids are playing in front of crowds of 45,000 people who are hanging onto their every pitch. This is more fans than some major league teams can only dream about having in their own stadiums. Most of the star pitchers are throwing about 200 pitches on short rest which is something that you will never even see anymore in the major leagues. The pressure is not limited to the fans at the park. According to Biz of Baseball the 2009 had 1.56 million viewers. This was a 60% increase from the year before.

Military service Gander, initially a family pet named Pal, accidentally scratched a child's face with his paw. Worried that he would be forced to have Pal put down, the original owner gave the large dog to The Royal Rifles of Canada, a regiment of the Canadian Army stationed at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland and Labrador. The soldiers quickly renamed him Gander and \\"promoted\\" him to sergeant. When the unit was shipped to Hong Kong in the fall of 1941, Gander went along. The Battle of Hong Kong began on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Gander helped fight the Japanese invaders on three occasions. The last time, Gander picked up a thrown Japanese hand grenade and rushed with it toward the enemy, dying in the ensuing explosion, but saving the lives of several wounded Canadian soldiers. After efforts by the Canadian War Museum, the Hong Kong Veterans Association, and the Hong Kong Veterans Commemorative Association, the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals awarded Gander the Dickin Medal on October 27, 2000, the first such award since 1949. The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the Victoria Cross. The citation reads: > For saving the lives of Canadian infantrymen during the Battle of Lye Mun on > Hong Kong Island in December 1941. On three documented occasions, Gander, > the Newfoundland mascot of The Royal Rifles of Canada, engaged the enemy as > his regiment joined The Winnipeg Grenadiers, members of Battalion > Headquarters \\"C\\" Force and other Commonwealth troops in their courageous > defence of the island.

In the nearby village of Antonowka, the number of Jewish inhabitants is estimated at 750-482. Vol V - p. 45-46). consecutively, the Jews were massacred in the woods, after being forced first to dig their own mass graves. There were two brothers, who escaped both pogroms, Szmuel and Josef Liderman.Rev.

They were shot at, and Szmuel was injured in the hand. Naked and exhausted, the two reached the house of Stanis≈Çaw Jasi≈Ñski, who was an acquaintance of their murdered father, from before the Invasion of Poland. Jasi≈Ñski family took in the two Jewish escapees. Emilia bandaged Szmuel's hand, and clothed them both. The brothers were put in the barn, where they slept on straw mattresses. They were housed and fed without recompense. After a few days, two more Jews showed up at Jasinski's house, Szaje Odler and Akiba Kremer. They had also escaped the massacres in local forests, and like the other two, were given shelter and assistance. 1939 map showing Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship (no longer in existence), with the town of Kostopol (now Ukraine) The hideout Once the four refugees rested enough, it was decided that a bunker would be dug beneath the cowshed, as a more permanent hideout for themselves, with the Nazi threat of the death penalty looming over everyone, including the Jasi≈Ñski children. However, the place became unsafe after just two months, as soon as the Jasinskis became widely known as sheltering Jews on their farm. The fugitives left and hid even deeper in the forest, where they remained until the arrival of the Red Army in July 1944. They were lucky enough to survive the massacres of Poles in Volhynia by Ukrainian nationalists which went on since 1943, however, they were caught by the Ukrainian assassins in August 1944 already behind the Russian front. Akiba Kremer, Szaje Odler and Josef Liderman were murdered. After the war ‚Äì once her father died ‚Äì Emilia Slodkowska emigrated to the United States. Szmuel Liderman, who was the only surviving fugitive hidden by her, learned about her address years later and the two began corresponding.

It is notable as the publisher of Drum magazine, one of the earliest gay publications in the United States and the one most widely circulated in the 1960s, and for its role in organizing many of the nation's earliest LGBT rights demonstrations.Loughery, p. 270 The Janus Society takes its name from the Roman two-faced God Janus of beginnings, endings, and doorways. The organization focused on a policy of militant respectability, a strategy demanding respect by showing the public gay individuals conforming to hetero-normative standards of dress at protests. The Janus Society grew out of lesbian and gay activists meeting regularly, beginning in 1961, in hopes of forming a Mattachine Society chapter. The group was not officially recognized as such a chapter, however, and so instead named itself the Janus Society of Delaware Valley. In 1964 they renamed themselves the Janus Society of America due to their increasing national visibility. Mae Polakoff was the group‚Äôs first president (from 1962 to 1964).https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3779r083/ In January 1962 East Coast Homophile Organizations (ECHO) was established, with its formative membership including the Janus Society, the Mattachine Society chapters in New York and Washington D.C., and the Daughters of Bilitis chapter in New York. ECHO was meant to facilitate cooperation between homophile organizations and outside administrations.ECHO Monthly, 26 Jan.-1 Sept., 1963 On Friday, February 21, 1964, president of the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., Dr. Franklin E. Kameny, gave a free lecture on homosexual discrimination at the New Century Club, sponsored by the Janus Society. He talked about the fight against employment, educational, and housing discrimination against the gay community. On April 25, 1965 over 150 people were denied service at Dewey's, a local coffee shop and diner in Philadelphia. Those denied service were variously described at the time as ‚Äúhomosexuals,‚Äù ‚Äúmasculine women,‚Äù ‚Äúfeminine men,‚Äù and ‚Äúpersons wearing non-conformist clothing.‚Äù Three teenagers (reported by the Janus Society and Drum to be two males and one female) staged a sit-in that day. After restaurant managers contacted police, the three were arrested. In the process of offering legal support for the teens, local activist and president of the Janus Society, Clark Polak, was also arrested. Demonstrations took place outside the establishment over the next five days with 1500 flyers being distributed by the Janus Society and its supporters. Three people staged a second sit-in on May 2, 1965. The police were again called, but refused to make arrests this time. The Janus Society said the protests were successful in preventing further arrests and the action was deemed ‚Äúthe first sit-in of its kind in the history of the United States‚Äù by Drum magazine. Due to its close ties with Drum and president Clark Polak's various sex businesses, the Janus Society faced increasing scrutiny and harassment from local, state, and federal authorities, eventually ceasing operations in 1969 weeks before the Stonewall Riots after Polak was arrested on federal obscenity charges.https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3779r083/ Records of the Janus Society are held by the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives, under collection number 2008-027.https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3779r083/https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3779r083/entire_text/ Drum Drum (usually written DRUM) was an American gay men‚Äôs culture and news magazine based out of Philadelphia.

It is a particular local development of the Chinese art of penzai, as was bonsai in Japan. The phrase H√≤n Non B·ªô comes from the Vietnamese language: H√≤n ‰∏∏ means Island, Non °Ω´ means Mountain, and B·ªô ÈÉ® means a combination of water, mountain range and forest, or it can also mean \\"imitating the way the scenery looks in miniature\\". H√≤n Non B·ªô may be quite large and elaborate or small and simple. It was used to grace the courtyard entrance of the traditional Vietnamese home. Throughout Vietnam history, H√≤n Non B·ªô have been built for emperors, generals, and other important people as monuments, decorations, personal vistas, and as cultural icons.  History  Miniature landscape art was first recorded after Vietnamese independence in the year 939. A version of this was the H√≤n Non B·ªô (lit., \\"island-mountain-panorama\\"), which is designed to be seen from all sides. People, even the poorest, placed rocks and plants surrounded by water in containers or basins originally carved from stone. (Later these were formed from stucco, and then from concrete.) Individual H√≤n Non B·ªô could be a foot or two in height. Sometimes these were also known as ti·ªÉu c·∫£nh, the art of mini-scenes, where the tree is the main subject and it is larger than the mountains portrayed. Members of royalty built larger versions up to 20 or 25 feet high (with mountains always larger than the backdrop trees). Almost always one or more of these landscapes were included in the grounds of their palaces and temples to form a part of the sacred enclosure. At some point, these were often accompanied by parallel verses in Chinese, stereotyped quotations that everyone knew thanks to popular collections of expressions for use on various occasions. Incense sticks and some miniature figurines might also be a part of their construction. This was done even after Ngo Quyen's death ushered in a period of civil strife. Temples were built with H√≤n Non B·ªô in order to commemorate the deeds of the kings who ruled between the years equivalent to 968 and 1005. From 1225 to 1400, the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty ruled Vietnam and repelled the invading Mongol forces of the Yuan Dynasty in 1258, 1285, and 1288. Most of the magnificent palaces were destroyed in the process. These were subsequently rebuilt, complete with H√≤n Non B·ªô, using the labor of enemy collaborators. In 1406, the Chinese Ming dynasty king ordered his army to invade Vietnam and confiscate all things related to that culture, such as books and art objects, and bring them back to China. The following year, the interim Vietnamese ruler was caught by invaders, carnage followed, and all works of art and architecture were destroyed‚Äîincluding H√≤n Non B√¥. Later, the L√™ Dynasty (1428-1788) rebuilt many of the devastated palaces and H√≤n Non B·ªô were very popular features in the renovations. Mini-scenes and miniature landscapes made during this period used Cycas revoluta (sago palms) on the birthdays of kings, lords, and elderly high-class people. The scholar Nguy·ªÖn B·ªânh Khi√™m (aka Trang Tr√¨nh, 1491‚Äì1585) was said to have used a H√≤n Non B·ªô to provide guidance while predicting the fate or destiny of others. H√≤n Non B·ªô, as well as miniature plants and rocks, are mentioned in ƒêo·∫°n Tr∆∞·ªùng T√¢n Thanh, a thousand-page book by Nguy·ªÖn Du (1766‚Äì1820). During the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty (1802‚Äì1945), the art of miniature plants without much additional landscaping, c√¢y ki·ªÉng, flourished. (It was called c√¢y c·∫£nh in the north.) Kings enjoyed planting pines and junipers; mandarins loved growing Thuja orientalis and Casuarina; intellectuals or other notable figures liked Ficus; and lay people devoted themselves to planting mallow (Malva), Tamarindus indica, and Melaleuca leucadendra. Except for those planted by kings, all trees planted for pleasure by mandarins or lay people had to have their tops bent downward because it was considered impertinent to superiors to have treetops growing upward. A H√≤n Non B·ªô was constructed by the Nguyen emperors in the pond of Di√™n Th·ªç Palace in the Imperial City of Hu·∫ø. An example of H√≤n Non B·ªô scenery is on display in the Botanical Building in San Diego, California.Maren Dougherty \\"Ocean, mountain, forest ‚Äî Vietnamese art of hon non bo combines these elements into miniature landscapes\\" North County Times Friday, August 24, 2007 See also * Bonsai ‚Äì the Japanese art of miniature tree cultivation * Penjing ‚Äì Chinese art of miniature tree cultivation * Saikei ‚Äì tray gardens using bonsai * Bonkei ‚Äì Japanese dry tray landscapes * Tree shaping ‚Äì shaping trees for art and structure Notes Category:Bonsai Category:Types of garden Category:Landscape design history Category:Vietnamese art ","title":"H√≤n non b·ªô"},{"id":"24000409","text":"WGVV-LP (92.5 FM, \\"Groove 92.5\\") is a low-power FM radio station licensed to serve the community of Rock Island, Illinois.

N. 83/13/L, Prot. N. 144/17 Significance The feast focuses firstly on Jesus‚Äô Priestly Office (Latin: Munus sacerdotale). He is considered the model for believers, and for the clergy in particular, with priests acting In persona Christi (‚ÄúIn the person of Christ‚Äù). The laity are thus urged to pray that priests would be more like Christ, the compassionate and trustworthy high priest (Hebrews 2:17), ever- living to intercede for humanity before The Father (Heb 7:25). The Second Vatican Council taught many things about the Priesthood of Christ, and sharing in that one Priesthood through the Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Orders. This development has been reflected in many subsequent documents. One effective way to build upon this teaching is to establish the Feast of Christ the Priest more widely. What Pope Pius XI wrote about the feast in honor of Christ‚Äôs Kingly Office can be said just as truly about this feast in honor of Our Lord‚Äôs Priesthood: Liturgical aspects The feast has its own proper texts for the Mass, as for the Votive Mass of the Blessed Eucharist B.

He was born in Montreal to Captain John Andrew McMaster and his wife Amelia and educated at Montreal High School, Montreal Collegiate Institute and at McGill University and the University of Edinburgh. Graduating with a law degree, he was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1901 and was made King's Counsel in 1910. McMaster practiced law in Montreal with the firm of Fleet, Falconer, Cook, Brodie, Magee, Papineau, Campbell, Couture, Kerry and Bruneau before becoming Crown Attorney for the district of Montreal. Entering politics, McMaster was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1917 federal election defeating Brigadier General Dennis Draper in the riding of Brome. The election was held as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and McMaster ran for the anti-conscription Laurier Liberals. He was re-elected in the 1921 federal election as a Liberal. He did not run for re-election in 1925. Moving to provincial politics, McMaster was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec as the Quebec Liberal Party MLA for Compton in a 1929 by-election shortly after he had been appointed Provincial Treasurer in the cabinet of Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. He succeeded Jacob Nicol as both Treasurer and as the MLA for Compton. McMaster presented one budget, in January 1930 before the Great Depression had made its impact. He resigned from cabinet in October 1930 and retired from politics at the 1931 provincial election. In the 1936 provincial election McMaster broke with the Liberals and endorsed his son-in-law, Jonathan Robinson who was a candidate for the rival Union Nationale in the provincial electoral district of Brome. Robinson was elected and was served as Minister of Mines in the government of Maurice Duplessis in the 1940s.

This is a group of fungi that substitute serine for leucine when the CUG codon is encountered. S. stipitis is distantly related to brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which uses the conventional codon system. Found, among other places, in the guts of passalid beetles, S. stipitis is capable of both aerobic and oxygen limited fermentation, and has the highest known natural ability of any yeast to directly ferment xylose, converting it to ethanol, a potentially economically valuable trait. Xylose is a hemicellulosic sugar found in all angiosperm plants. As such xylose constitutes the second most abundant carbohydrate moiety in nature. Xylose can be produced from wood or agricultural residues through auto- or acid hydrolysis. Ethanol production from such lignocellulosic residues does not compete with food production through the consumption of grain. Given the abundance of xylose and its potential for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials to renewable fuels, Pichia stipitis has been extensively studied. The complete sequencing of its genome was announced in 2007. Native strains of S. stipitis have been shown to produce ‚âà50 g/l ethanol in 48 h from pure xylose in defined minimal medium using urea as a nitrogen source. S. stipitis is a predominantly haploid yeast but strains can be induced to mate with themselves or with other strains of S. stipitis by cultivating cells on minimal medium containing limiting amounts of carbon sources and nitrogen. An extensive genetic toolbox has been developed for S. stipitis that includes synthetic drug resistance markers for nourseothricin acetyltransferase gene (nat1), hygromycin (hph) and a synthetic form of Cre that enables excision of the markers. Engineered strains of S. stipitis will produce 57 g/l ethanol from pure xylose in under 48 h and adapted strains will produce significant amounts of ethanol from acid hydrolysates of lignocellulose. This natural ability of S. stipitis to ferment xylose to ethanol, has inspired efforts to engineer this trait into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae is preferred for ethanol production from grain and sugar cane, because it ferments hexose sugars very rapidly and is very robust. However, it does not natively metabolize xylose. This limits the usefulness of S. cerevisiae in the production of fuels and chemicals from plant cell walls, which contain a large amount of xylose. In response, S. cerevisiae has been engineered to ferment xylose through the addition of the S. stiptis genes, XYL1 and XYL2, coding for xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase, respectively. The concerted action of these enzymes converts xylose to xylulose, which is naturally fermented by S. cerevisae. Additional modifications are necessary for rapid fermentation of xylose, however.

Smith was born in Manhattan, New York around 1887, and worked as a \\"boss stevedore\\" for much of his adult life. He was reportedly related to local ward district politicians and, in an editorial by the New York Tribune, \\"acquired his leadership of this gang because of petty political influences\\".\\"Priest Denounces Gangs; Militant Father Raywood Warns \\"Tanner Smith Terrors.\\"; Will Invoke Mayor's Aid, Says Anti-Clubbing Order Prevents Police From Stopping Violence\\". New-York Tribune. August 1, 1910 Tanner Smith and the Maginals, sometimes allied with the Pearl Buttons and later the Gopher Gang, battled the Hudson Dusters for control over the Hudson River waterfront and eventually took over when the Hudson Dusters disappeared from the district. Tanner eventually made the Pearl Buttons junior partners of the Marginals. Winona Club shootout Tanner and Owney Madden, then leader of the Gopher Gang, had been allies against the Hudson Dusters and eventually formed a close working relationship. Together they opened the Winona Club, a clubhouse intended to serve as a joint rendezvous and headquarters, located on West Forty-Seventh Street near Tenth Avenue. The gang's unruly behavior at the club soon disrupted life in the relatively well-to-do neighborhood as its members regularly \\"engaged in drunken revels and made the night hideous with the sound of their bickerings and brawlings\\". The owner of the building, Dennis J. Keating, was a blacksmith by trade and apparently had no knowledge of his tenants identities. Keating lived with his family on the ground floor and, when neighbors began complaining to him about the noise, he confronted the gang warning that he would have to evict them if they could not keep the noise down. Tanner and Smith, who had been \\"discussing affairs of state over a bottle of whiskey\\", were surrounded by a half dozen gang members from both sides \\"lounging about the room listening to the music of a piano thumbed by a gifted thug\\". Upon being confronted by their landlord, Madden turned around and replied \\"You'll put out of your house? Mister, did you ever hear of Owney Madden? Yes? Well, Mister, I am Owney Madden!\\" Keating retreated to his home downstairs and was afraid to report the gangsters to the police fearing for his family's safety. The Gophers were especially known for their violence against police informers. Instead, a tenant from a neighboring boarding house ended up making a noise complaint and a police officer, Patrolman Sindt, from a local precinct were dispatched. Sindt quickly returned to the precinct when he discovered the occupants. He requested reinforcements from the precinct captain and a reserve squad under Detective Sergeant John J. O'Connell was sent out. Madden's spies informed their leader of their approach and by the time of O'Connell's arrival, the gangsters had already barricaded themselves inside. O'Connell's demand that they allow the police to enter the clubhouse was \\"greeted by threats and curses\\". O'Connell then walked up to the front door and banged on the front door with his club to which one of the gangsters fired out a window \\"and grazed a policeman's skull\\". Madden then called out to police threatening \\"We'll shoot the gizzard out of any cop who tries to get in here!\\" O'Connell then ordered his men to withdraw around a corner and sent two patrolmen to gain entry to the building from the rear. The rest of the squad were then marched across the street, in full view of the gang, and O'Connell approached the club once again and started an argument with Madden and Tanner. While the rest of the gang crowded around the front windows to watch their leaders taunt the police, a rear window was left unguarded allowing the two patrolmen to sneak into the building. The two officers crept through the house until reaching the front room here the gang had gathered. They then rushed the gangsters in a surprise attack and the startled men were forced back momentarily. O'Connor immediately had his men break down the doors and within 15 minutes had placed all of the men under arrest and put them \\"handcuffed and bleeding\\" in a paddy wagon to a nearby precinct. Legal battle against the NYPD In court the next morning, both men were given light sentences. Madden, then still a minor, was \\"lectured by a benevolent judge\\" and placed under a $500 bond for six months. Tanner had also received minimal punishment and later gained an audience with then Mayor of New York William J. Gaynor where he showed his bruises to Gaynor and accused the arresting officers of police brutality. It was this meeting that resulted in the passage of \\"Order No. 7\\", a directive issued by Mayor Gaynor which prohibited the use of a billy club unless the officer could prove his life was in danger. In March 1910, Tanner made a formal complaint against Patrolmen William H. Noll, Charles G. Flaherty and Andrew Brown who were accused of violating \\"Order No. 7\\". He claimed that he had been celebrating New Year's Day at a dance hall on Forty- Second Street and Eighth Avenue when the three officers, all on the staff of Inspector George W. McClusky of the Third District, threw him down a stairway while being ejected from the building. All three officers denied the allegation and claimed Smith fell down the stairs himself.\\"Dismisses Two; Fines Three. Baker Makes Short Work of Policemen Involved in Assault on a Woman\\". New York Times. March 3, 1910 A number of people testified as character witnesses on the officers' behalf, several of them fellow police officers, however all three were fined on April 12, 1911. Noll and Flaherty were both fined 15 days pay while Brown was fined a full month. This case was part of a major grand jury investigation headed by First Assistant District Attorney Frank Moss. Smith was later tried and convicted for shooting a police officer.\\"Crime-Wave Inquiry Nearing An End; Prosecutor Moss Expects Much Good to Follow Even if Indictments Are Not Found\\". New York Times. April 13, 1911 War with the Gophers On June 19, 1914, Tanner was arrested by police during a running gunfight with a member of the Gopher Gang. A local officer, Patrolman Krozer, had heard four gunshots fired in West Twentieth Street, near Tenth Avenue, and went to investigate. When he reached West Twentieth Street, Krozer witnessed the gang leader, with a revolver in his hand, chasing after a rival Gopher. Krozer pursued Tanner to a vacant lot on Twentieth Street where Smith proceeded to fight with the officer. A second officer, Patrolman Derleph, arrived to help Krozer subdue Smith and place him under arrest. As they took him away, members of his gang showed up and threatened the officers but were kept at bay. Tanner, while being booked at the West Twentieth Street Precinct, challenged the desk lieutenant to fight and was later charged with felonious assault. It was believed by police that Tanner and his gang were at war with Madden and his Gophers for control of lower Westside Manhattan.\\"Gangster Fights Police.; Tanner Smith Is Arrested After Shooting in a Gang Feud\\". New York Times. June 19, 1914 Smith was sent to prison for carrying a revolver and served a year sentence. Retirement and murder While in jail, many of the Marginals were arrested and imprisoned in The Tombs. Much of this was due to the NYPD's campaign against the city's street gangs, but also for some members connection to the First Labor Slugger War involving labor racketeers Benjamin \\"Dopey Benny\\" Fein and Joseph \\"Joe the Greaser\\" Rosenzweig against a coalition of independent gangsters headed by Philip \\"Pinchy\\" Paul.\\"Unions Face Inquiry To Smash Gang Ring; District Attorney Opens Special Bureau to Investigate on New Lines\\". New York Times. January 24, 1915 Following his release in late 1914, Tanner decided to retire from crime after persuasion from his mother and sister. He spent the next five years as a boss stevedore and contractor. He became a successful businessman who gave back to his local neighborhood. He set up several boys clubs to keep the next generation out of trouble. In early 1919, he opened the Marginal Club above an Eighth Avenue saloon and apparently returned to his former criminal activities. On the night of July 26, 1919, Smith was playing poker at the Marginal Club when he was shot in the back and killed by an unknown assailant. It was speculated by police that Smith had been murdered in an underworld \\"gang feud\\". In the days following Smith's murder, Smith's followers went on a violent rampage in the underworld. George Lewis, a 21-year-old gang leader who had been feuding with Smith, was viciously attacked in Hoboken, New Jersey on July 31. Robert \\"Rubber\\" Shaw, an underworld rival and last leader of the Hudson Dusters, was killed shortly thereafter. On August 1, the District Attorney's office began rounding up members of Smith's organization and was prepared to charge at least two members with murder. Authorities in Hoboken followed suit taking several suspects in for questioning. Both the NYPD and the District Attorney's office believed that Shaw, Lewis and Link Mitchell, who had since fled the state, were responsible for Smith's murder and that friends of Smith had retaliated by going after Lewis and Shaw. Under the direction of District Attorney Edward Swann, Assistant District Attorney John F. Joyce stated that he intended to seek indictments and said \\"We have at least three persons who saw Shaw, Lewis, and a third man enter the Marginal Club, walk up behind Smith and begin shooting. Our records show that Lewis was released from Elmira Reformatory three months ago. He had been sent away for \\"sticking up\\" United Cigar Stores. In some respects, the case may be similar to the Baff murder in West Washington Market five years ago.\\"\\"Shot To Avenge Gangster. Police Believe 'Tanner' Smith's Friends Killed Shaw\\". New York Times. August 2, 1919 The next day, a joint search was organized by both New York and New Jersey police to apprehend Lefty Curry and Michael Costello, a suspect in the then recent murder of underworld figure Rubber Shaw. Curry, according to Joyce, was seen leaving the Marginal Club shortly after Smith had been shot and that he had been shot in the leg.\\"Seek Two In Smith And Shaw Murders; General Alarm Is Sent Out for Michael Costello and 'Lefty' Curry.

August 3, 1919 Tanner was worth about $25,000 (although other sources claim he had as much as $100,000) at the time of his death, or so his mother claimed, however he left no will and an application for letter of administration was made on her behalf on August 14.\\"Tanner Smith's Estate $25,000\\". New York Times. August 14, 1919 The following day in Surrogate's Court, his brother applied to become temporary administrator of Tanner Smith's estate until his widow could appear in court. His brother claimed that Smith's widow had previously left him to marry another man and was living in South Brooklyn under the name Mary O'Brien McGuire. Of the $25,000, about $15,000 had been deposited in Liberty Bonds and used as bail for Link Mitchell, then accused of robbery. Mitchell was later charged as an accessory to the murder of James Shore in Hoboken, New Jersey, a suspect in the murder of Smith.\\"Tanner Smith Left A Widow\\". New York Times.

However, Lewis protested the court's ruling and said \\"Your Honor, you can't do that. I've been in prison before. Only first offenders get the benefit of an indeterminate sentence.

He was a relative of Charles' first wife, Frederuna, and was originally from Lotharingia. Though Frederuna had died in 917, by 918 Hagano had become the king's favourite and his most trusted advisor. The aristocracy despised him, however, and the authority of Charles over the nobles was severely weakened by Hagano's presence at court.Jean Dunbabin, \\"West Francia: The Kingdom\\", The New Cambridge Medieval History, III: c. 900‚Äìc. 1024, ed. Timothy Reuter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 378‚Äì79. Charles' sin appears to be transferring grants in benefice, especially of monasteries, from his barons to Hagano. In 919 the West Frankish barons refused to assist the king in repelling a Magyar invasion. One of the leading Lotharingian barons, Gilbert, threw his support behind Henry the Fowler, the German king, and, according to Flodoard, was elected \\"prince\\" (princeps) by the Lotharingian aristocracy.Michel Parisse, \\"Lotharingia\\", The New Cambridge Medieval History, III: c. 900‚Äìc. 1024, ed. Timothy Reuter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 314. Flodoard also records that Robert of Neustria made a treaty with the Vikings without royal permission. When, in 922, Charles granted Hagano Chelles, at that time already held by Rothilde, a daughter of Charles the Bald, the barons of West Francia revolted and made Robert king in Charles' place. French historian Charles B√©mont edited a document (#5 in manuscript 9016 of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France) for the pi√®ces justificatives of his biography of Simon de Montfort in which a baron reminds Henry III of England of what happened to \\"Charles l'Assot√©\\" when he listened too closely to unpopular advisors.Simon de Montfort: comte de Leicester, sa vie (120?‚Äì1265) son r√¥le politique en France et en Angleterre (Paris: 1884), 341.

The red line shows where the Iapetus Suture extends through present-day Ireland and Great Britain. A related suture through Denmark, Poland and Ukraine is the Trans- European Suture Zone. The Iapetus Suture is one of several major geological faults caused by the collision of several ancient land masses forming a suture. It represents in part the remains of what was once the Iapetus Ocean. Iapetus was the father of Atlas in Greek mythology, making his an appropriate name for what used to be called the 'Proto-Atlantic Ocean'. When the Atlantic Ocean opened, in the Cretaceous period, it took a slightly different line from that of the Iapetus suture, with some originally Laurentian rocks being left behind in north-west Europe and other, Avalonian, rocks remaining as part of Newfoundland. Background The Iapetus Ocean was an ancient ocean which existed in the Southern Hemisphere approximately 600 million years ago and was bordered by several paleocontinents: Laurentia, Ganderia, Carolinia, Avalonia, and Baltica. During a series of geological events, the Salinic orogeny and Caledonian orogeny all three land masses began to converge upon each other slowly diminishing the ocean by subducting the oceanic crust. By the end of the Silurian period, approximately 420 million years ago, the ocean had disappeared. The geological fault zone resulting from the continental collision is known as the Iapetus Suture, named after the ocean it replaced. The closure of Iapetus involved a complex and protracted collisional history of numerous micro-continents, volcanic arcs and back-arc basins that were accreted to Laurentia and Avalonia between the Early Ordovician and Late Silurian. The notion of a single suture zone in a complex orogen such as the Appalachian/Caledonian is unrealistic as several temporal and spatial distinct suture zones are present. In Canada The Early Ordovician (Taconic) Baie Verte Line in Quebec and Newfoundland marks the boundary between the continental margin of Laurentia and Iapetan oceanic rocks, while the Early Ordovician (Penobscot) GRUB Line defines the contact between the vestiges of Iapetus and Ganderia. The Middle Ordovician Red Indian Line is considered the main Iapetan suture zone in that it separates peri-Laurentian and peri- Gondwanan oceanic elements. The Dog Bay Line is a younger feature in the Appalachians and delineates the terminal Iapetan suture in Newfoundland as it marks the Early Silurian (Salinic) collisional zone between Ganderia and Laurentia.J.

Morrissey U-Pb detrital zircon geochronological constraints on the Early Silurian collision of Ganderia and Laurentia along the Dog Bay Line: The terminal Iapetan suture in the Newfoundland Appalachians. Am J Sci, February 1, 2007; 307(2): 399‚Äì433 In the United States The suture runs through the north- eastern states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Rhode Island lies entirely to the east of the suture.https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Generalized-geologic-map-of-New- England-showing-the-terranes-of-the-northern-Appalachians_fig1_236833332 In Ireland The estuary of the River Shannon (Ireland's largest river) follows the line of the Iapetus suture on the west coast. The suture reaches the east coast at Clogherhead in County Louth. Ireland's crust (and sedimentary rocks) to the north-west of the suture originally derives from Laurentia (proto-North America), while the crust to the south-east is Avalonian (\\"European\\"). On the Isle of Man (Niarbyl Fault) The Niarbyl Fault marks the Iapetus Suture on the Isle of Man. The rocks at top and left formed in Laurentia but the rocks at lower right formed in Gondwana The Niarbyl Fault is an exposed section of the Iapetus Suture as it crosses through the Irish Sea. It is readily visible in present-day Niarbyl on the southwest coast of Isle of Man. The fault is manifested by two major rock groups which abut each other, both deposited by their respective, aforementioned continents ‚Äì the Manx Group to the south-east and the Dalby Group to the north-west. The Niarbyl fault is evidence of two paleocontinents colliding: Avalonia on which present-day England is located and Laurentia which contains both present-day North America and Scotland. The fault is visible close to the shoreline downhill from the Niarbyl Cafe and Visitor Centre in Niarbyl. In Great Britain The Caledonian orogeny united the northern and southern portions of present-day Great Britain. The Iapetus Suture runs from the Solway Firth to Lindisfarne.

It is known only from high altitude forest and grassland habitats in the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador. Seven other species of Thomasomys live in the same areas. First collected in 1903, T. ucucha was formally described as a new species in 2003 and most closely resembles T. hylophilus, which occurs further to the north. The species is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in the IUCN Red List as a result of habitat destruction. Medium-sized, dark-furred, and long-tailed, T. ucucha can be distinguished from all other species of Thomasomys by its large, broad, procumbent upper incisors. Head and body length is and body mass is . The tail is scarcely furred. The front part of the skull is flat, short, and broad. The incisive foramina, openings at the front of the palate, are short, and the palate itself is broad and smooth. The root of the lower incisor is contained in a prominent capsular process. Taxonomy The first three specimens of Thomasomys ucucha were collected in 1903 at Tabl√≥n in Pichincha Province, Ecuador, by L. S√∂derstr√∂m. It was not found again until Robert S. Voss of the American Museum of Natural History collected a total of forty- three specimens at nearby Papallacta, Napo Province, in 1978 and 1980 (the type locality is described as the valley of the Rio Papallacta). Papallacta is in a remote area that is difficult to access, and the mammal fauna of the region remains poorly known. In 2003, he formally described the animal as a new species, Thomasomys ucucha,Voss, 2003, p. 10 in a publication in American Museum Novitates in which he also reviewed the mammal fauna of Papallacta.Voss, 2003, p. 2 The generic name, Thomasomys, honors English zoologist Oldfield Thomas, who named about 2,900 taxa of mammals,Beolens et al., 2009, pp. 410‚Äì411 and the specific name, ucucha, is the local Quechua word for \\"mouse\\". T. ucucha most closely resembles T. hylophilus, which is found further north in Colombia and Venezuela.Voss, 2003, p. 12 A comparison of mitochondrial DNA found that T. ucucha was closest to specimens identified as T. caudivarius and T. silvestris, but T. hylophilus was not included in this study.Lee et al., 2015, fig. 2 All are members of Thomasomys, a diverse genus that occurs in the northern Andes, from Bolivia to Venezuela.Voss, 2003, p. 8 Together with Rhipidomys and a few other, smaller genera, Thomasomys forms the tribe Thomasomyini, which includes over fifty species found in South America and Panama. Thomasomyini in turn is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.Musser and Carleton, 2005 Description Thomasomys ucucha is a medium-sized Thomasomys with a relatively long tail. The dense, fine, and soft fur is dark brown on the upperparts, changing gradually into the grey underparts. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long and extend beyond the ears when laid back against the head. Sparse short, dark hairs are present on the ears. The digits and metapodials (bones of the centers of the hand and feet) of the hands and feet are covered with dark hairs, but the ungual tufts at the bases of the claws consist of longer, gray hairs. The fifth digit of the foot is long, with the tip of its claw almost reaching the base of the claw of the fourth digit. The tail is dark and hardly furred, except for a pencil of long hairs at the end; some animals have a white tail tip. Females have six mammae.Voss, 2003, p. 11 In thirty-six specimens, head and body length is , averaging ; tail length is , averaging ; hindfoot length is , averaging ; ear length is , averaging ; and weight is , averaging .Voss, 2003, table 1 The front (rostral) part of the skull is short --shorter and broader than in T. hylophilusVoss, 2003, p. 13--and flat and the notches in the zygomatic plates at the sides are poorly developed. The plates themselves are broad.Voss, 2003, table 2 The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust. The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the molars, are short and do not reach near the first molars; they are longer in T. hylophilus. They are widest where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple posterolateral palatal pits at the back of the palate, near the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid strut separates two foramina (openings) at the base of the skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of T. ucucha follows the primitive pattern. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, overlaps the suspensory process of the squamosal bone. At the back of the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process to receive the root of the lower incisor, which is absent in T. hylophilus. The large upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge at about a right angle to the upper molars, and heavily pigmented with orange. Those of T. hylophilus are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented. The orthodont upper incisors suffice to distinguish T. ucucha from all other members of the genus but T. australis and T. daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high- crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp at the front of the first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well- developed than in T. hylophilus. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in T. hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced. The glans penis is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough at the top and a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with penile spines, except for an area near the tip. Distribution and ecology Thomasomys ucucha occurs only in the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador in the provinces of Pichincha, Napo, and Carchi.Lee et al., 2015, p. 7 At Papallacta, Thomasomys ucucha was collected in a variety of habitats at altitude, including p√°ramo (high-mountain grassland with shrubs and forest patches) and subalpine rainforest.Voss, 2003, p. 14 Most were taken in runways (paths through vegetation made by animals) and a few alongside small streams or on a low tree.Voss, 2003, pp. 14-15 At Guandera Biological Reserve in Carchi, the species has been found at a slightly lower elevation, . Other muroid rodents found at the same places as T. ucucha include two akodontines (grass mice), Akodon latebricola and Akodon mollis; two ichthyomyines (water rats), Anotomys leander and Neusticomys monticolus; two oryzomyines (rice rats), Microryzomys altissimus and M. minutus; the thomasomyine Chilomys instans; and five other species of Thomasomys, T. aureus, T. baeops, T. cinnameus, T. erro, and T. paramorum.Voss, 2003, p. 15 Other species have been recorded nearby, and Voss wrote that T. ucucha may occur sympatrically with seven other species of Thomasomys. With Akodon latebricola and Thomasomys erro, T. ucucha is one of three species that are known only from the northeastern Andes of Ecuador.Voss, 2003, p. 37 Conservation status Thomasomys ucucha is locally common, but has a very limited known distribution. Its conservation status has been assessed as \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN because of its highly localized distribution; it may be threatened by the destruction of its habitat for agricultural purposes, but occurs near or in several protected areas.Tirira, 2007, p. 198 References Literature cited   * (partial PDF). * External sources * Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica del Ecuador, Bioweb data, maps and photographs Category:Mammals of Ecuador Category:Thomasomys Category:Mammals described in 2003 Category:P√°ramo fauna ","title":"Thomasomys ucucha"},{"id":"24001014","title":"Washington Street station (San Diego Trolley)"},{"id":"24001020","text":"Aristotelia fruticosa, the mountain wineberry or shrubby wineberry, is a tree- shrub from New Zealand, in the family Elaeocarpaceae.

Sri Duggirala Gopalakrishnayya, was a very captivating poet, speaker, songwriter, philosopher, singer and an extraordinary revolutionary with a philosophy of non-violence. Sri Nadimpalli Venkata Lakshmi Narasimha Rao worked in tandem with Sri Duggirala Gopalakrishnayya. For his exemplary work and sacrifices for freedom movement in Andhra, he was fondly conferred the name 'Andhra Ratna' (Jewel of state Andhra Pradesh state) Early life Sri Duggirala Goapalakrishna was British educated with the financial help of his friend nadimpalli narasimha rao who also studied Law at the University of Edinburgh. When he returned to India, he served for some time in the Government College at Rajahmundry and the National College at Machilipatnam, AP. He was, however, not satisfied with the kind of education that was imparted there. Moreover, after attending the Calcutta Congress session in 1920, he was attracted to principles of 'non-co-operation' and 'Satyagraha', and resolved to dedicate his life to the achievement of Swaraj (native rule). For this purpose, he trained a band of a thousand volunteers who were self-disciplined and brave warriors. He gave them the name \`Ramadandu' (Army of Lord Rama). He put them to work to test their patience at the All-India Congress Session in Vijayawada to maintain peace and order. All- India leaders were immensely pleased with the kind of work they did. National leaders like Nehru and Gandhi have been well convinced that such a disciplined force of volunteers was need at the time, and praised Sri Duggiralas' mobilising skills and inspirational living. Chirala ‚Äì Perala Movement Chirala and Perala were two contiguous villages in Prakasam (then part of Guntur) district with a population of 15,000. The British Government wanted to combine them into a municipality in 1920, to obtain more taxes from people who are already suffering due to misrule of British on one hand, and their repressive measures on the other. In January 1921, the residents refused to pay the municipal taxes. Several of them including a woman, Duvvuri Subbama were prosecuted, tried and sentenced to imprisonment. She was considered to be the first woman in the country to be imprisoned on political grounds and she was bestowed with the title Desabandhavi . After the All-India Congress session at Vijayawada, Gandhiji came to Chirala. Gopalakrishnayya sought his advice on the future course of action to be taken. Gandhiji suggested two alternatives, (1) to continue the No-Tax Campaign in a non-violent manner and (2) mass exodus of people to the vacant areas beyond the municipal limits. The second would automatically end the municipality. But he made it clear that whatever course they chose the Congress would bear no responsibility and that they must stand on their own legs. Gopalakrishnayya had enough confidence in himself and the people, and in spite of the warning, he persuaded the residents to move to the area outside the municipal limits and raise temporary tenements which he called \`Ramanagar'. It was an unprecedented step in the history of the country. For eleven months people lived there in thatched huts braving the severity of weather. Gopalakrishnayya and his Ramadandu kept up the morale of the people. Their aim was to establish a parallel government and demonstrate to the outside world what Swarajya, as conceived by him, would be like. He constituted an Assembly comprising members elected from each caste and established an arbitration court. Sankirtans and Bhajans kept up the morale of the people. He, however, faced financial difficulties and he went to Berhampore in 1921, when the Andhra Conference was in session to collect some money. There he was prohibited to address the public meetings but he defied the orders. He was arrested and sentenced to one year's imprisonment and sent to Trichinapally. There was no other person who could occupy his place. The Government also took repressive measures against those who built sheds on government lands. People returned to their homes in the municipality at the end of eleven months and reconciled themselves to its constitution. Though the movement succeeded partially, the qualities of courage and fearlessness they developed stood them in good stead in the subsequent stages of the freedom movement. Later, the British realised the anti-government sentiment in the people and reconciled to keep both Chirala and Perala separately, as earlier.

A widow, Tsune (O-Tsune) Nonomiya (Ch≈çko Iida), works hard at a silk production factory to provide for her only son, Ry≈çsuke. When Ry≈çsuke's teacher ≈åkubo (Chish≈´ Ry≈´) persuades her to let her son continue to study beyond elementary school, she decides to support her son's education even until college. Her son promises to become a great man. Thirteen years later, in 1936, O-Tsune, now in her sixties, visits Ry≈çsuke (Shin'ichi Himori), who is twenty-eight, in Tokyo. She learns that her son, now a night school teacher, has married and even has a one-year-old son. Her daughter-in-law Sugiko is nice and obliging, but Ry≈çsuke's job does not pay much. Ryosuke and O-Tsune visit ≈åkubo, who is now a father of four and running a tonkatsu restaurant. The couple keeps the mother entertained but their money is running out. On a trip to an industrial district one day, Ry≈çsuke confides in the mother that he wishes he had never come to Tokyo, and that he is a disappointment to his mother. He later states that Tokyo is not a place where one can succeed easily. O-Tsune chides her son for giving up, telling him she has nothing now left, neither land nor house, and she only wants him to succeed. Sugiko sells her kimono and raises enough money for the whole family to go out to enjoy themselves. However Tomibo (Tomio Aoki), a neighbor's son, gets injured by a horse and Ry≈çsuke rushes him to the hospital. There he gives their money to Tomibo's mother for her to foot the hospital bill. O-Tsune sees all this, and later tells Ry≈çsuke he has done her proud for his selfless act. O-Tsune eventually returns to Shinshu, but not before giving the couple some money for her grandson. Ry≈çsuke promises his wife he will obtain a teaching certificate. Back at Shinsh≈´, O-Tsune tells her friend at the factory her son has become a \\"great man\\".

Football career Gill was born in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire before moving to south-west England where he played as an amateur for White Star (Poole), Bridgwater Town and Bristol City (without making any first-team appearances). His performances earned him a call-up to represent the Somerset County Football Association. After playing for Grimsby Town reserves, he was offered a trial by Southern League champions, Southampton. He made his solitary appearance for the \\"Saints\\" on 17 March 1900, when he took the place of Peter Meechan at right-back against Sheppey United. Although the match was won 5‚Äì0 (with two goals each from former England internationals Alf Milward and Harry Wood), Gill had a poor game. Nonetheless, the Southampton board offered him a position with the club, which Gill decided to decline. He subsequently turned out for local rivals, Freemantle, before moving back to his home county in 1901. He then signed for Leicester Fosse of the Football League Second Division, making one appearance at left-back, replacing George Swift.

It was founded and run by Keshav Shankar Pillai, a pioneering political cartoonist. The magazine has been compared to Punch. The magazine printed its first issue in 1948 after Pillai left the Hindustan Times after pressure from Times editor Devdas Gandhi to stop publishing critical cartoons of C. Rajagopalachari, a prominent Congress leader. The magazine was launched by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, with whom Pillai shared a close friendship, even though Pillai described the magazine as \\"fundamentally anti- establishment\\". Shankar's Weekly became a platform for aspiring cartoonists across the country. Prominent cartoonists who published in the weekly include R K Laxman, Rajinder Puri, Kevy, Kutty, Bal Thackeray and Yesudasan. The magazine invited contributions from readers in a designated space. Many cartoonists, such as E. P. Unny, published through the readers' column. According to Unny, Shankar's Weekly was the \\"homing ground for the second generation of Indian political cartoons\\". Shankar allowed a variety of styles to function together despite himself being a very powerful leader with certainty for the craft. There was no common house style ‚Äì a variety of personal styles were created by the cartoonists. However, Shankar was very particular on the tools used for drawing ‚Äì he insisted on the use of the brushes rather than pens. In 1975, two weeks into The Emergency, the magazine shut down after having run for 27 years. According to the founder, the Emergency was not the cause of the closure. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi wrote a letter to Pillai on hearing of the closure, stating she will \\"miss the journal\\".

In professional wrestling, Harrison is best known for his time in the short lived XWF promotion ran by Jimmy Hart. While in the XWF, Harrison held his first and only singles professional wrestling championship, the XWF Heavyweight Championship. Harrison was awarded the championship in preparation for a storyline \\"XWF Invasion\\" of Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council promotion. Working under the name \\"Awe\\" he was also awarded the XWF World Tag Team Titles with his partner Shock (Del Rios) in Memphis Wrestling but would vacate the title when he left the promotion. As a bodybuilder, Harrison competed in many competitions and picked up wins as Mr. Britain (Junior) and Mr. Universe (Junior) in 1988. He turned professional in 1989 (competing until 1998) and was known for his immense physical strength and his ability to do ten or more reps with a set of 200 pound dumbbells. Early life and Bodybuilding According to Harrison's official website, \\"Ian was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England in 1969. He began studying Judo when he was 8 years old and began weight training at the age of 15. He competed in the bodybuilding industry from the age of 16 when he won the U-17 Mr. Yorkshire and then at 19 he won Junior Mr. Universe in London, England. In 1989 Ian won the Heavyweight and Overall titles at the IFBB British Championship at the age of 20 therefore achieving Professional status. He was the youngest ever to do so. He then started his first gym, Body Balance, in Leeds and trained at that facility throughout his bodybuilding career, 1993-1998. Ian competed 3 years in the Arnold Classic, Mr. Olympia in ‚Äô95, and guest posed worldwide. 13 magazine covers, and a plethora of training articles Ian was ranked top 10 in the world for 5 years straight and became known as an authority in training and nutrition.\\" Professional wrestling career In a 1999 interview with Anabolic Extreme's Jason Mueller, Harrison revealed that in his time away from the bodybuilding scene he had been spending time traveling all over Wales and Scotland learning how to wrestle. Stating that he was still a bodybuilder at heart, he wasn't opposed to pursuing a career in wrestling if it really took off. In 2001 the American Professional Wrestling scene had witnessed the fall of two of the biggest and most influential promotions of the modern era as Extreme Championship Wrestling filed for bankruptcy, and World Championship Wrestling was acquired by the World Wrestling Entertainment. Looking to fill the void left with just one major promotion running the show, wrestling manager Jimmy Hart and a number of other famous wrestlers formed the XWF. Harrison was signed to the promotion with high hopes that his unique look and incredible physique would help make him become one of the company's homegrown stars. Since the XWF didn't have a television deal, all matches were taped in hopes of using the footage to secure a deal with a network. He debuted on XWF programming as a heel, professional wrestling terminology for a \\"bad guy,\\" or \\"villain\\" and sported trunks with Britain's Union Jack across the front and the back. In his debut, he made short work of Horace Hogan, dominating his opponent with a powerslam and mounted strikes before finishing him off with a leg scissors submission hold placed around the head and neck of Horace who was forced to submit at one minute and thirty five seconds into the contest. During his time with the promotion he also competed against Norman Smiley, and worked with Curt Hennig against Buff Bagwell and Vampiro. He was undefeated during his time with the promotion. Though the taped episodes never made the airwaves in the United States, they were aired in Puerto Rico where a storyline \\"XWF Invasion\\" was written to take place in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council in order for the company to receive some exposure. In preparation for this planned invasion, the XWF Heavyweight Championship was awarded to Harrison in August 2002. Harrison briefly wrestled for Memphis Wrestling on behalf of the XWF, who were running yet another invasion angle. In Memphis, he would compete under the name \\"Awe\\" and primarily wrestle in tag team matches with his partner Shock. \\"Shock & Awe\\" were announced as the XWF World Tag Team Champions on an edition of Memphis Wrestling's television show 31 May 2003 and would hold onto the titles until Harrison left the promotion.

It is located south of Palm Springs, west of the Salton Sea, and east of Temecula, in the County of Riverside, California. Part of the mountain is under the jurisdiction of the San Bernardino National Forest. Another portion, including the 8,717 ft summit and the United States Geological Survey marker on the summit (registered in 1939), is gated and controlled by the Santa Rosa Indian Reservation. A third portion of the mountain is administered by the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument. Location The mountain is accessible from California State Route 74 (also known as the Pines to Palms Highway) via a dirt road approximately 5 miles east of Route 74's junction with Route 371. The dirt road begins at an elevation of 4,700 feet and heads towards the summit for approximately 13 miles. A 4x4 or off-road vehicle is recommended because the road is steep and rocky. It comes to a locked gate around 8,200 ft and from there it is a 500-foot hike to the summit up a rough maintenance road that passes the former MCI (now owned by Verizon Communications) primary power generator that provides electricity to the summit. Top of the peak From Toro Peak's summit one can see the Santa Rosa Mountain Range to Palm Springs, and neighboring mountains such as San Jacinto Peak, Mount San Gorgonio, Palomar Mountain, and Hot Springs Mountain. To the east/southeast, the Salton Sea and Imperial Valley are visible. From the peak in good weather Charleston Peak in Nevada is also visible.  Vegetation  Mixed Conifers, White Firs, Incense Cedars and Jeffrey Pines Toro Peak and the Santa Rosa Mountains come under the category of sky island mountains. Vegetation on the mountain is a mixed variety of trees: Incense Cedar, White Fir, Jeffrey Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Sugar Pine and on the highest slopes Limber Pine, which is an ice age remnant species. Typical of mountains closest to the Pacific in California, these trees ignore the elevation separations of vegetation (known as life zones) that are found on many other mountains. For example, in the adjacent picture, trees such as White Fir and Incense Cedar, are seen growing on the lowest extent of the mountain beside dryer, weather-tolerant trees such as Jeffrey Pine and Ponderosa Pine.  Climate  In winter, the weather on Toro Peak and the Santa Rosa Mountains can be difficult. Snow falls on the mountain more than a few times during the winter and accounts for most of the annual precipitation, with a second percentage coming from monsoonal thunderstorms during the summer. Nighttime and daytime seasonal lows in the winter and seasonal summer highs are taken from the Long Valley Ranger Station on neighboring Mount San Jacinto. Toro Peak 1939 Geological Survey Marker This mountain is one of the many scattered sky islands in the southwest. Toro Peak's high elevation helps clear the smog emitted from Los Angeles and the Inland Empire. There is limited human activity beyond a few remote campsites on various parts of the mountain. The peak has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb).

He was most notable for authoring the Abortion Control Act of 1982, a law that includes, with some exceptions, \\"requirements that a married woman notify her husband, that there be a 24-hour wait before any abortion, and that doctors show patients a pamphlet with pictures of developing fetuses,\\" as well as another law to prevent suit against doctors for wrongful birth or wrongful life for not giving information about risk of fetal abnormalities. The Abortion Control Act was mostly upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States except for the spousal notification provision in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In 1988, Freind provoked controversy by claiming that it is 'almost impossible' for a woman to become pregnant through rape, as it causes her to 'secrete a certain secretion, which has a tendency to kill sperm'. In 1984, a bill drafted by Freind was enacted into law that changed the way adults who were adopted as children access their original birth certificates. This became Act 195 of 1984 or Adoption Act of 1984. This act is a lesser-known component of Freind's abortion agenda. Freind was convinced that denying adult adoptees access to their original birth certificates would lower abortion rates. As of 2012, 44 states allow adult adoptees equal access to their original birth certificates. Early life and education Freind was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and graduated from the Malvern Preparatory School in 1962. He received a B.A. from Villanova University in 1966 and a J.D. from Temple University Law School in 1969. Run for Senate In 1992 Freind gave up his state house seat to challenge Arlen Specter in the Republican U.S. Senate Primary. Freind ran well to the moderate Specter's right, accusing Specter of having more in common with Democrats than Republicans. Although Specter went on to win, he had to spend a considerable amount of money to do so. This left him in a weakened position for the general election, in which he just barely defeated Democratic challenger Lynn Yeakel.

He was a favorite of the Emperor Muhammad Shah but was appointed governor of Allahabad in 1739 against his wishes due to the Vizier Qamar ud-Din Khan and re-called to court in 1743 C.E. He was naturally of free speech and the emperor fond of his repartee had him more license in his conversation than was consistent with respect to his own dignity when he was on business with the emperor which by degrees disgusted Muhammad Shah and made him wish his removal from office. He was consequently with the consent of the emperor stabbed with a dagger by a person who had been discharged from his service and fell down dead on the spot. This circumstance took place on Friday the December 26, 1747. He was buried after four days in the mausoleum of Khalilullah Khan his grandfather which is close to the Sarai Ruhullah Khan at Delhi.

The village lies at the confluence of several drainage channels, where two pumping stations discharge water into Vernatt's Drain from land in Deeping Fen to the South and West. Water from Pinchbeck South Fen to the North is also lifted into Vernatt's Drain. The village arose to service the pumping stations. The village is largely a Ribbon development stretching from the Pumping stations and the Fishermans Arms public house along Bourne Road toward Spalding. The village post office and small shop is now also a bed and breakfast, and an outside catering service. No separate population statistic is available for Pode Hole. The best available report is for the whole Pinchbeck civil parish, which covers several settlements north and east of Spalding with a total of 5,153.Office for National Statistics web site, 2001 census At the 2011 census population details can be found under the civil parish of Pinchbeck. The name may well be a reference to a marshy location, possibly with a population of frogs and toads. Description of a field named Pode Hole in a nearby village Attributes Somerset village name Podimore to frogs, saying pode=frog Pode Hole farm, near Thorney probably derives its name the same way. Pode Hole has one of the earliest rain gauge records of precipitation, beginning in 1726. Pode Hole falls within the drainage area of the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board,Welland and Deepings IDB successors to the original Deeping Fen commissioners. Pumping stations Pumping stationsMost of this section taken from 'Machines, Mills & uncountable costly necessities', R L Hills, Goose & Co (Norwich), 1967 were installed because the cill at Vernatt's Sluice, where the drain discharges into the Welland above Spalding, was higher than the cill of the precursor sluices at Pode Hole. The fen drains could not naturally discharge into Vernatt's Drain. There was a history of windmill-driven pumps and later small steam engines across The Fens but the two engines at Pode Hole were the first of the large scale pumping efforts, and an encouragement to later schemes. John Rennie was consulted in 1818, and he proposed diverting the upper reaches of Vernatt's Drain from the Welland to the Witham to improve the fall. It is unclear if this would have worked, but the funds were not available and a later proposal for steam engines at Pode Hole was interrupted by his death. In the end an engineer called Benjamin Bevan appointed by the commissioners placed orders for two beam engines from separate engineers, Fenton and Murray of Leeds, and Butterley of Derby. The first was 60hp, the second 80 hp. Butterley supplied both scoop wheels. The engines started work early in 1825, and continued in use until 1925. A third steam engine was erected on the North bank of Vernatt's drain to lift water from Pinchbeck South Fen. This operated between the early 1830s until the end of the century. This was built as much because that fen was under separate control for those years as because the capacity was required. The water from the South drain is piped under Vernatt's drain to the Pode Hole station, much as it was tunnelled before the 1830 engine was built. (The idea of a tunnel under a river is not unique. Not far away at Bourne South Fen Gilbert Heathcote's tunnel was built under the River Glen, and might have been the inspiration for the system at Pode Hole.) The beam engines were maintained in storage until 1952, but then scrapped. Diesel engines were already in use across the fens when Pode Hole was modernised in 1925. The current Ruston diesel engines date from 1964 and vertical axis axial flow Foster Gwynnes pumps are driven by David Brown gear boxes. The second station alongside uses electric pumps and was built in the 1960s. The original pumping station building is a major feature in the village, and is still in use for workshops and a small museum. The by-laws of the original commissioners are prominently posted on the outside.

He was son of Ahmed Ali Khan and Fatima Bagum, a native of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. Life He was brought up in Salar Jung. He received his early education in his native land in Madrasa-i-Aliya which was affiliated with Hyderabad School (Noble School) to form Nizam College. He graduated from University of Bombay, followed by study at the University of Chicago in Education and Sociology at graduate level (1927‚Äì28) and mainly at Cornell University, where he received his Ph.D. in Rural Sociology (1929), his thesis was: \\"Social change in the Hyderabad state in India as affected by the influence of Western culture.\\" In 1938 Ali came under the influence of Mirza Abul Fazl, who aroused his interest in and reverence for the Qur'an. He was a scholar of wide erudition and clear vision, and was gifted with special insight into the Qur'an. He devoted more than thirty years in translating the Qur'an into poetic English to recapture its beauty and rhythm. He was aware of the significance of the chronological order of the Qur'anic revelation and arranged it according to chronological order. His translation came out in 1974 with the title, The Message of the Qur'an: Presented in Perspective. Ali was an educator and an active advocate of calendar reform for about ten years. He was a leading Muslim authority on calendar matters. He initiated in Hyderabad a movement to synchronize the dates of the Fasli months with the Gregorian calendar, and finally succeeded, in 1946, in persuading the Nizam to authorize the proposed reform. His success in this far-reaching revision emboldened him, as a liberal Muslem, to analyze the problem of introducing effectively The World Calendar in the realm of the Crescent. He returned to America in 1953 under a fellowship from the Fulbright and Ford Foundation. As regards calendar, Ali maintained that Hindu Calendars are by far the nearest approaches to the actual machinery of astronomical phenomena governing life on our planet. Ali led a varied and distinguished career in academia and government, including three years of association with Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. He was Director at Rural Institute, Jamia Millia Islamia (1960‚Äì65). He was Private Secretary to the Chief minister of Hyderabad, Rt. Hon'ble Sir Akbar Hydari, and he served as Trustee of some of H.E.H. the Nizam's Private and Religious Trusts (1967) established by the last hereditary ruler of Hyderabad. He was dean of agriculture at Osmania University, Hyderabad, Deccan, India. Between 1926 and 1969, he travelled U.S.A. Australia, Egypt, Tehran, Baghdad, Beirut, Istanbul and Japan. He wrote on sociological and Islamic subjects. Throughout his life he challenged many long-held false beliefs either concocted by medieval orthodoxy or which someway crept into the Islamic Faith. His wife Soghra Amir-Ali (b. 3 May 1911) strongly supported his activities. Hashim Amir-Ali died in 1987 at Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, survived by one daughter and two sons. His sons Hyder Amir- Ali and Asad Amir-Ali and daughter Naveed Jehan Reza are now residing in the U.S.A.

It has dark-coloured, deeply furrowed ironbark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven on a branched peduncle, white flowers and conical, hemispherical or cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus paniculata is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has grey to black or brownish, deeply furrowed ironbark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are a lighter shade of green on the lower side, long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green, a lighter shade on the lower side, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are mostly arranged in groups of seven on a branched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum, the floral cup more or less square in cross-section. Flowering occurs in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical, hemispherical or cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves close to rim level.  Taxonomy and naming  Eucalyptus paniculata was first formally described in 1797 by James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London from material collected by David Burton at Port Jackson. Smith obtained the specimens from the herbarium of Joseph Banks. The specific epithet (paniculata) is from the Latin word paniculatus meaning paniculate, referring to the arrangement of the flowers.  Distribution and habitat  Grey ironbark grows in high rainfall coastal areas from Bermagui to Bulahdelah. Previously a common tree in the inner western suburbs of Sydney. A remnant ironbark still grows in the inner city suburb of Glebe at St. Johns church.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 48  Uses  Grey ironbark is well regarded by foresters for the high quality of timber.

He served as a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1998 to 2016, representing Alabama House District 58 (Birmingham). In September 2017 Robinson pleaded guilty to federal charges of bribery, conspiracy, honest services fraud and tax evasion. FBI and IRS investigations determined that Robinson endeavored to thwart the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed efforts to prioritize and expand the 35th Avenue Superfund site in North Birmingham pursuant to a secret contract he had entered into with a lawyer with the Birmingham law firm Balch & Bingham on behalf of its client, coal miner and processor Drummond Company.  Early life  Robinson graduated from Woodlawn High School in Birmingham in 1978 and enrolled in the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). After a season with the San Antonio Spurs, a year in the Continental Basketball Association, and a year spent touring with Athletes in Action, he returned to UAB to graduate in 1987 with a B.S. in Urban Affairs and minors in political science, business and sociology. After graduation he worked as vice president of AmSouth Bank and manager of its Office of Community Affairs. In 1999, the year after he was elected to the House, he cofounded ABI Capital Management, an investment advisory firm and underwriter, with Willie Huff. With his wife Sakina, also a UAB graduate, he founded Robinson & Robinson Communications. The couple published the biannual Community Reinvestor magazine.  Basketball career  Robinson was a 6'4\\" guard born in Birmingham, Alabama who played collegiately at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He has the distinction of being the first player to ever sign a scholarship with the school.UAB Alumni Article At UAB, Robinson was a two-time first team All-Sun Belt Conference pick and was the conference Player of the Year in 1982.2008‚Äì09 UAB Men's Basketball Media Guide ‚Äì Record Book In his senior year, Robinson led UAB to their best season as the Blazers went 25‚Äì6 and upset No. 1 seed Virginia in the NCAA Tournament to reach the Mideast Regional Final, where he was named the Regional MVP. Robinson's number was later retired by the school. Following his collegiate career, Robinson was drafted by the San Antonio Spurs in the second round of the 1982 NBA Draft (24th pick overall). Robinson played in 35 games for the Spurs in the 1982‚Äì83 NBA season, averaging 2.9 points per game in limited minutes.NBA stats from basketball-reference.com He was elected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2008. Political career  Robinson represented the 58th District in the Alabama House of Representatives from 1998 to 2016. At the time of his resignation in 2016 he was the vice-chairman of the Jefferson County Legislative Delegation. He served on the Banking and Insurance, House Education Policy, Financial Services, Military and Veterans Affairs and Rules committees and had chaired the House Government Operations Committee. On November 30, 2016, in a press release, Robinson said he wanted to vacate his seat so that his daughter, Amanda Robinson, could keep a job to which she had been appointed as liaison between the Alabama legislature and Governor Robert Bentley's office, and thus avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. He pointed out that his daughter would be the first African-American and the first female in Alabama history to hold that position, and said, \\"This is why I am retiring now, to give my child every opportunity to succeed.\\" He intended to \\"focus on the children where I once lived, Gate City and Harris Homes.\\" Six months later in June of 2017, Robinson abruptly announced he was leaving his seat and permanently retiring from politics. Corruption charges In 2017 he was charged and entered into a plea agreement relating to allegations that business interests funneled money into his eponymous nonprofit in exchange for Robinson's opposition to polluted Birmingham neighborhoods being designated EPA Superfund sites. Oliver Robinson pleads guilty, must cooperate or face up to 100 years John Archibald September 07, updated September 07, 2017 Later in the month two Balch & Bingham partners working in its Environmental and Natural Resources section, Joel Gilbert, and section Chair, Steve McKinney, along with Drummond Company vice-president of government affairs David Roberson, were indicted on \\"one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, one count of bribery, three counts of honest services wire fraud, and one count of money laundering conspiracy,\\" with charges against McKinney later dismissed. On September 27, 2018, Robinson was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release. The following month, Gilbert was sentenced to five years and Roberson was sentenced to \\"two-and-a-half years in prison, followed by one year of supervised release\\", and each was also fined, pursuant to July 2018 convictions on \\"six criminal charges each relating to a scheme intended to stop expansion of a toxic cleanup site in Jefferson County by the Environmental Protection Agency\\", by bribing Robinson, using his nonprofit organization, The Oliver Robinson Foundation.Hrynkiw, Ivana \\"Former Drummond V.P. and Balch lawyer sentenced to federal prison\\", AL.com, Advance Local Media LLC., October 23, 2018.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976 listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and open to the public.  Description  Cabins at the Lodge complex The Keweenaw Mountain Lodge Complex covers , and consists of multiple buildings, including the main lodge and 23 cabins. A golf course, constructed at the same time as the lodge and cabins, covers much of the remaining land. Mountain bike trails and a disc golf course have been added in recent years. All structures within the district are unified by their rustic construction; the structures have low gable roofs and are made using rough-cut stone and dark painted logs.  History  During the early 1930s, the Great Depression hit Keweenaw County hard. The mining industry had fallen on hard times, and unemployment stood at over seventy percent. Ocha Potter, the head of the Keweenaw County Road Commission and superintendent of Ahmeek Mine, conceived of constructing a resort complex in the county. In 1933, he applied to the federal government for funding under the newly created Civil Works Administration. The county Board of Park Trustees had previously negotiated purchase of of land from the Keweenaw Copper Company, situated about south of Copper Harbor. Clearing of the forest cover began in the winter of 1933/34, and the stumps were cleared as the weather let up. The logs from the property were used construct the lodge. By the end of 1934, the lodge was nearly completed and the first nine holes of the golf course were cleared and seeded. (A second planned nine holes was never completed.) In 1935, another project to build 20 cabins was approved by the Works Progress Administration, which were completed during the next few years. Four additional cottages were built in 1947/48 using profits from the operation of the lodge. In July 2018, Keweenaw County will auction off the lodge.  Significance  The lodge complex was designed and built in 1934 and 1935, in the depths of the Great Depression, using crews of local workmen. The construction was overseen by Keweenaw County and used federal relief money. The site is an example of government-funded work projects designed to boost local economies, and is significant in its effort to protect and maintain the environment while offering recreational opportunity.

The two sides of adult leaves are very different shades of green.  Description  Eucalyptus acmenoides is a tree that grows to a height of or more, although only half that height in dry sites. It has thin stringy or fibrous, grey to reddish brown bark. Leaves on young trees are egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped glossy green, up to long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, glossy green but much paler on the lower side, long and wide. The flowers are arranged in groups of mostly between seven and eleven on an angular peduncle long, individual flowers on a cylindrical pedicel long. The buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide. The operculum is conical or beak-shaped, about as long and wide as the flower cup. The fruit is a globe-shaped to hemispherical capsule, long and wide. Taxonomy Eucalyptus acmenoides was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer from a specimen collected by Allan Cunningham in a forest in New South Wales in January 1817. The description was published in Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers' book Repertorium Botanices Systematicae (Volume 2). The specific epithet (acmenoides) refers to a similarity to plants in the genus Acmena. This tree is sometimes referred to as the yellow stringybark in parts of Queensland, however, despite the rough and somewhat stringy bark, this tree is considered to be in the mahogany group of eucalyptus. Eucalyptus acmenoides is part of the white mahogany group as recognised by Ken Hill. The others in the group are E. mediocris, E. apothalassica, E. carnea, E. helidonica, E. latisinensis, E. psammitica and E. umbra.  Distribution and habitat  White mahogany grows in wet forest and woodland, in deeper soils with reliable moisture and is found between areas near the Atherton Tableland in Queensland and south to Port Jackson. It is found from sea level to altitudes of . It is most common in warm humid to tropical climates where the annual average rainfall is between .  Timber  White mahogany is well regarded for the high quality of timber. The timber has various uses, including heavy engineering, poles, railway sleepers, bridge and wharf construction, framing, decking stumps, fence posts, joists, flooring, plates and weatherboarding. The sapwood is usually not attacked by the lyctus borer. Heartwood is light, of a pale yellowish brown. The texture is medium and even. Grain structure is uniform, however at times it can be interlocked. Timber somewhat similar to the tallowwood, but not quite as greasy. Wood resistant to termites. Timber is hard, heavy, strong, tough and durable. Around 1000 kilograms per cubic metre.

Inspired by the example of his glider flying brother Edgar, Dittmar took an apprenticeship at the German Institute for Gliding (DFS). In 1932, flying his self-built glider Kondor, he won a first prize at the Rh√∂n Glider Competition. Dittmar then became a research pilot.

Later the same year, he achieved a new world record for long-distance using a Fafnir II and was awarded the Hindenburg Cup. In 1936, he achieved the first crossing of the Alps in a glider. He then crowned his career as a glider pilot by becoming the first Gliding World Champion after his victory at the first Rh√∂n International Gliding Competition in 1937.

The album title refers to an ancient street in Hawley's native Sheffield, now thought to be the location of present-day Castle Street, which was allegedly named after 18th-century innkeeper Thomas Truelove, who used to charge local people to dump their rubbish in the gutter in the street that then flowed down to the River Don. Thematically, Truelove's Gutter is Richard's darkest album to date. Richard told the BBC that the album was inspired by particularly dark periods in his life and those of others. The album features some uncommon instrumentation, such as the waterphone, megabass, and cristal baschet. The first single, \\"For Your Lover Give Some Time,\\" was released as a three-track digital download on 10 August 2009. A second single, \\"Open Up Your Door\\", was released on 30 November 2009, also as a three-track digital download. \\"Remorse Code\\" was issued as the album's de facto third single on the EP False Lights from the Land on 7 June 2010. Critical reception The album was mostly well received by the critics. Allmusic said \\"The album is more sparse than anything he's released. Its eight songs have a decidedly late-night feel. The grand sweeping orchestral strings of his last two albums have been replaced by a chamber section and odd instrumentation... that add real intimacy to the proceedings... Truelove's Gutter is a singular moment in Hawley's catalog that displays the maturity of all his gifts. It is quietly passionate, graceful, elegant, utterly moving, and unequivocally beautiful in its honesty and sophistication.\\" BBC Music described the album as \\"a classic flawed masterpiece... Repeated plays reveal some truly sumptuous treasures... His strengths and weakness as a lyricist are laid bare by the sparse, moody atmospheres\\" but \\"aside from this, it's the sheer beauty and unity of feel that make this a more than worthy addition to the Hawley discography\\". The Daily Telegraph believed Hawley \\"has a strong claim to be the country's most accomplished songwriter\\" and described the tracks as \\"grown-up love songs ‚Äì elevated by hope but weighed down by experience ‚Äì and they sound all the more beautiful for it\\". Uncut said \\"Throughout, his mellowness of tone is the album‚Äôs defining feature... Miraculously, thanks to the minutiae of the arrangements, it‚Äôs a sound that never becomes one dimensional\\". Awarding the album eight out of ten, PopMatters called Truelove's Gutter \\"a beautiful and deceptively simple album\\" and said \\"this is a highly recommended album by an artist who seems to keep getting better. From what initially seemed like a limited palette, Richard Hawley has produced a masterpiece of tonal space that demands full concentration.\\" MusicOMH was similarly enthralled, saying \\"Just looking at the sleeve it's possible to deduce that within lies a much darker, more minimal sound relative to its predecessors... This minimal approach is matched by the sound of the album which rarely breaks its spell of intoxicating intimacy... Truelove's Gutter is yet another showcase for Hawley's subtle genius. Every sound on the album, from the notes to the vocals, is warming and rich with sensations. Six studio albums into his late- starting solo career and Hawley's light shows no signs of dwindling.\\" While generally positive about the album, The Guardian felt that \\"it's hard to escape a niggling feeling that Hawley is here polishing a formula, even falling back on cliche, in his continuing quest to make the local and homely sound lushly romantic\\". Spin was unimpressed, saying Truelove's Gutter \\"has moments of heartbreaking beauty. Too bad those moments are outnumbered by a reliance on secondhand lyrical conceits and drifting arrangements.\\" Pitchfork said \\"The gorgeous, backward-looking beauty of past releases like Coles Corner... has shifted toward something more dark, ambient, and withdrawn. It may be too slow for many, but it's more measured than it is mundane... Hawley can sound too stripped down this time out, and the two songs that hover near the 10-minute mark overplay the appeal of minimal compositions and Hawley's sweet croon\\" but ultimately \\"Hawley's mined a specific vein of emotion for years, and it's a testament to his skill that his hyper-local focus maintains such a broad appeal\\". Drowned in Sound noted the bleakness of the record, saying that Hawley \\"lends his uniquely melancholic voice to a uniquely melancholic album, even by his standards... Truelove's Gutter isn't all blackness, but even at its few hopeful moments there are those tinges of pessimism and cynicism that prevent it from ever being rose coloured. As a whole it's a musically and lyrically a beautiful reflection on the less than smooth course life can take.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Richard Hawley. # \\"As the Dawn Breaks\\" ‚Äì 4:35 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Atkin acoustic parlour guitar #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì mandola #* Thomas Bloch ‚Äì cristal baschet, glass harmonica #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì string organ # \\"Open Up Your Door\\" ‚Äì 4:42 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Gretsch Country Gentleman, Fender Musicmaster, Gibson ES-335, Danelectro baritone guitar, DeArmond \\"shadowtone\\" pedal #* Dean Beresford ‚Äì drums #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì Fender bass, glockenspiel #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì Spanish guitar, 12-string acoustic guitar, lap steel guitar, vibraphone #* Jon Trier ‚Äì piano #* The Red Skies ‚Äì string section # \\"Ashes on the Fire\\" ‚Äì 4:24 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Gretsch 6196, Atkin acoustic parlour guitar, Baldwin 12-string electric guitar #* Dean Beresford ‚Äì drums #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì Fender bass, piano, celeste #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì harmony vocals, Spanish guitar, Gretsch \\"48\\" synchromatic acoustic guitar, Tremolo mandolas, 12-string guitars # \\"Remorse Code\\" ‚Äì 9:51 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Atkin acoustic parlour guitar, Atkin jumbo guitar, Gretsch 6196, Burns Nu-Sonic, cymbals #* Dean Beresford ‚Äì drums #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì Fender bass, the enchanted lyre #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì tenor guitar, e-bow lap steel, feedback 12-string drones, dulcimer, Fisherman's lyre #* Jon Trier ‚Äì pipe organ # \\"Don't Get Hung Up in Your Soul\\" ‚Äì 4:16 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Atkin acoustic parlour guitar #* David Coulter ‚Äì musical saw #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì double bass #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì Alpine concert zither # \\"Soldier On\\" ‚Äì 6:50 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Atkin acoustic parlour guitar, Atkin jumbo guitar, Gretsch clipper, Gretsch 12-string, Fender Jaguar, Fender Telecaster, Danelectro baritone, Gibson 120T #* Dean Beresford ‚Äì drums #* Thomas Bloch ‚Äì Ondes Martenot #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì Fender bass, double bass feedback, wind chimes, vibes, gong #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì lap steel #* The Red Skies ‚Äì string section # \\"For Your Lover Give Some Time\\" ‚Äì 5:38 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì harpsichord, organ, celeste #* Donald Grant ‚Äì solo violin #* Liz Hanks ‚Äì solo cello #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì Spanish guitar, Fisherman's lyre #* The Red Skies ‚Äì string section # \\"Don't You Cry\\" ‚Äì 10:42 #* Richard Hawley ‚Äì vocals, Atkin acoustic parlour guitar, Gretsch 6120w, Gretsch G6118T-LTV 125th, snare drum #* Dean Beresford ‚Äì drums and cymbals #* Thomas Bloch ‚Äì cristal baschet, glass harmonica, waterphone #* David Coulter ‚Äì musical saw, waterphone #* Colin Elliot ‚Äì Fender bass, hi-hat, harpsichord, glockenspiel, organ, synthesizer, steel drum, sleigh bells, Tibetan singing bowls, backing vocals #* Shez Sheridan ‚Äì acoustic 12-string guitar, Fisherman's lyre, Gretsch electric 12-string guitar, Baldwin electric 12-string guitar, Selmer lap steel, backing vocals #* Jon Trier ‚Äì celeste Singles * \\"For Your Lover Give Some Time\\" (10 August 2009) ** Digital download * \\"Open Up Your Door\\" (30 November 2009) ** Digital download * False Lights from the Land EP (7 June 2010) ** 10\\" vinyl (also includes CD copy of EP) *# \\"Remorse Code\\" *# \\"Shallow Brown\\" *# \\"The Ellan Vannin Tragedy\\" *# \\"There's a Storm a-Comin'\\" Production credits * Produced by Richard Hawley and Colin Elliot at Yellow Arch Studios, Sheffield * Engineering and orchestral arrangements by Colin Elliot * Red Skies string section recorded in Axis Studios, Sheffield; engineered by Mike Timm * The Red Skies string section: ** Violins ‚Äì Donald Grant, Helena Smart, Catrin Morgan, Emma Wragg, Thea Spiers, Kirsty Mangan ** Violas ‚Äì Felix Tanner, Natalie Holt ** Cellos ‚Äì Lucy Payne, Liz Hanks ** Double bass on \\"For Your Lover, Give Some Time\\" ‚Äì Richard Pryce * Mastered by Duncan Cowell at Soundmastering, London * Sleeve design by Nick Phillips * Cover and cloud photography by Steve Gullick * Lyric photography by Julian Holtom References Category:2009 albums Category:Richard Hawley albums Category:Music in Sheffield Category:Mute Records albums ","title":"Truelove's Gutter"},{"id":"24001702","text":"Bulbophyllum stenochilum is a species of orchid in the genus Bulbophyllum.

The pai or grain measure used in these parganas was for a long time called Chintaman pai. Legend goes on to say that Dhalbhum was wrested from him by Jagannath Deb of Dholpur in Rajputana. After 32 generations Supur Raj, as it was locally called, was divided in consequence of a disputed succession. One of the successors continued at Supur and the other shifted to Ambikanagar. Both the families were related to the families of Bishnupur, Raipur, Shyamsundarpur and others. They ruled for about 700 years. A branch of the same family ruled in Chikligarh or Jamboni.

In January 2019 it celebrated 22 years of fierce independence. The agency is known creating some of for some of the world's most famous and best-loved campaigns; from the early Levi‚Äôs Odyssey spoof for Lilt,, to its celebrity-fronted \\"Goldspot\\" cinema adverts for Orange,, to \\"Here Come The Girls\\" for Boots and the PG Tips campaign featuring Al and Monkey.. Recent campaigns have included the story of 'Rang-Tan', first with Greenpeace, then Iceland ; waking the world up to the devastation caused by dirty palm oil, KFC's 2018 'FCK' apology or its much in demand 'Gravy Candle', and IKEA's enduring 'The Wonderful Everyday' campaign.

Notable campaigns Amnesty International Mother were the lead agency and co-executive producers for The Secret Policeman‚Äôs Ball for the fiftieth anniversary of Amnesty International. The show took place in the United States for the first time on March 4, 2012 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and featured a mix of prominent comedians from both Britain and the United States. After a taped introduction by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the live comedy lineup included Jon Stewart, Russell Brand, Eddie Izzard, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, David Walliams, Jimmy Carr, Noel Fielding, Matt Berry, Micky Flanagan, Jack Whitehall, Tim Roth, Bill Hader (as Julian Assange), Rex Lee (as Kim Jong-Un), and a cameo appearance by Richard Branson. Liam Neeson also introduced a set from formerly imprisoned Burmese comedian and political activist Zarganar. In between the comedic performances, the music lineup consisted of Mumford & Sons, Reggie Watts, and a concluding set by Coldplay. Additionally, Beavis and Butthead appeared in an animated sequence and former Monty Python members Michael Palin, Eric Idle, and Terry Jones appeared in pre-recorded video segments explaining comedically why they were not there. At several moments in the show, Statler and Waldorf from the Muppets commented on the event and spoke to the performers from one of the balconies.

It was described as a new species in 2003. Habitat B. trichorhachis was described from the discovery of a single plant, found growing as an epiphyte on a medium-sized tree within montane forests in the central part of Sulawesi, and at an altitude of . The holotype of this new species is lodged in the herbarium at Singapore Botanic Gardens (Herb. SING). Description The flowers of this species are entirely purple, each one only fully opening after anthesis of the previous one. The inflorescence itself is racemose, and its rachis spreads outwards and forwards in a zig-zag manner from the plant, and is not thickened. The inflorescence is between 30mm to 48mm in length, bearing from between one and 22 flowers, each on pedicels (flower stems) that are between 25mm to 29mm in length. The leaves are elliptic to (ob)ovate in shape, between 13mm to 19mm in length, and up to 5mm in width. Leaves are borne on extremely short petioles, approximately 0.2mm in length. The plant has creeping rhizomes, up to 1mm in diameter. The species is very similar to Bulbophyllum iterans, but differs from the latter in having smaller flowers in which there is no median ridge, plus a rachis that is unthickened. Unlike most other species within this genus, the inflorescence of B. trichorhachis is racemose, and at the time of its discovery it was only the second species within the Section Hybochilus to have this form of flower structure.

Erdnase is a pseudonym used by the author of The Expert at the Card Table, a book detailing sleight of hand, cheating and legerdemain using playing cards. Still considered essential reading for any card magician, the book (usually known as just Erdnase, EATCT, or sometimes the Bible) has been in publication since 1902. Erdnase's true identity is one of the enduring mysteries of the magic community.  Identity  S. W. Erdnase was most likely a way for the author to conceal his real identity so he wouldn't be arrested, since Federal laws at the time prohibited the publication and distribution of \\"obscene\\" material. In the late 19th and early 20th century, many judges considered books on gambling methods obscene (see Comstock laws). S. W. Erdnase spelled backwards is \\"E. S. Andrews\\" leading many investigators to search for people named Andrews as possible candidates.  Milton Franklin Andrews  Martin Gardner has proposed that a small-time con man named Milton Franklin Andrews was the author. Another proponent who researched this theory was Barton Whaley, in his book The Man Who Was Erdnase, which contains eyewitness interviews from the 1940s. Andrews was wanted by police for questioning in relation to a murder inquiry. When the police found Andrews he shot himself dead after fatally shooting his female companion. Andrews was only 33, as stated in The Man Who was Erdnase. Others argue against Andrews being Erdnase because the known examples of his writing are very much inferior to the exceptional writing of The Expert at the Card Table. There has been newer evidence since the year 2000 that puts to rest the assumption that Milton Franklin Andrews was Erdnase. It is obvious that Andrews was a card cheat but that is as far as his connection goes. Other historians have also found other men that could have indeed been S.W. Erdnase.  Wilbur Edgerton Sanders  Some argue that Erdnase was probably a well-educated, locally prominent individual, hiding behind an alias to protect his social standing. The late David Alexander, a magician and private detective, did quite a bit of work to find a better and more possible candidate than Milton Franklin Andrews, and he proposed that Erdnase was a prominent mining engineer named Wilbur Edgerton Sanders. (Note that \\"S. W. Erdnase\\" is an anagram of \\"W. E. Sanders\\".) Since Alexander's death, others have researched Wilbur Edgerton Sanders. Genii Magazine devoted a large portion of its September 2011 issue to an exploration of Alexander's theory, providing substantial circumstantial evidence that links Sanders to Erdnase.  E. S. Andrews  Todd Karr has identified a Midwestern-based con artist and business swindler named E. S. Andrews who was active around the turn of the century and whose biography and range of known locations seems to fit Erdnase's. Also, E.S. Andrews spelled backwards is S.W. Erdnase. L'Homme Masqu√© Juan Tamariz has advanced the theory that Erdnase was written by the Peruvian magician named \\"L'Homme Masqu√©\\" (The Masked Man), who lived in Europe. :Juan Tamariz tiene la hipotesis que el Erdnase fue escrito por el mago peruano del siglo XIX L'Homme Masqu√© que vivi√≥ en Europa y es considerado uno de las m√°s grandes magos de toda la historia, hasta el propio Dai Vernon lo considera entre los tres m√°s grandes. Durante el IX Congreso Latinoamericano de Magia FLASOMA 2009 realizado en Per√∫, explic√≥ las razones y el fundamento por el cual el autor del Erdnase fue L'Homme Masqu√©. Durante la explicaci√≥n de esta teoria estuvo presente Gaetan Bloom respaldando esta hipotesis. :Juan Tamariz has the hypothesis that Erdnase was written by the 19th century Peruvian magician \\"L'Homme Masqu√©\\" (The Masked Man), who lived in Europe and is considered one of the greatest magicians in history, even Dai Vernon himself considers him among the three greatest. During the 9th Congress of the Latin American Federation of Magic Societies (FLASOMA 2009) held in Peru, he explained the reasons and grounds for which the author of Erdnase has to be L'Homme Masqu√©. During the explanation of this theory Gaetan Bloom was present, supporting this hypothesis.  Others  Many other people have also been proposed, including James Andrews, James DeWitt Andrews, Robert Frederick Foster and Herbert Lee Andrews, which have been discussed and debated on the Erdnase topic on the Genii Forum since 2003http://forums.geniimagazine.com/viewtopic.php?t=1240  Bibliography    References  External Resources * Artifice, Ruse, and Subterfuge at the Card Table: a Treatise on the Science and Art of Manipulating Cards From the Harry Houdini Collection in the Rare Book and Special Collection Division at the Library of Congress Category:American gambling writers Category:American magicians Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Pseudonymous writers ","title":"S.

As stated in the book The Orchids of the Philippines, synonyms of Bulbophyllum weberi include Bulbophyllum baucoenese, Cirrhopetlumalum baucoense, and Cirrhopetalum weberi. It is endemic to the Philippines. The common name of Bulbophylum weberi is Weber's bulbophyllum because of its discovery by C.M. Weber, the man that took the type specimens. Ames named it Bulbophyllum weberi in The Philippine Journal of Sciences in 1912. Dr. Karl Senghas assigned it to the genus Cirrhopetalum in Schlecter's Orchidean in 1983.(Cootes, Banks,& Titmuss., 2001.,pg.56) This orchid is yellow in color and has dark red and brown spots. It grows upright and sympodial. It usually has around ten blooms. The petals are triangular and it grows on the base of tree trunks at elevations of about 1500 meters.(Cootes,J., Banks.P.D.,& Titmuss,D.2001.,pg.56) Dorsal sepal of B. weberi was entirely yellow with purplish blotches, also on long multicellular hair at apical part. In B. weberi, the both surfaces of dorsal sepal were smooth, with a few minute sunken unicellular (situated in pairs) or bicellular trichomes in small depressions. The apical part of the sepal abaxial (outer) surface bore stomata, placed also in the depressions. The residues of secretory material were detected on the outer (abaxial) slightly rugose surface, also on trichomes and stomata. Close to the hair, flat cells were transformed into conical papillae with striate wall pattern, also on apical hair. (Kowalkowska, A.K. Turzynski, S.

It was the second of three bouts between the pair. It gained its name from the moment at the end of the eighth round when Dur√°n turned away from Leonard towards the referee and quit by apparently saying, \\"No m√°s\\" (Spanish for \\"No more\\"). Pre-fight Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Dur√°n had first fought on June 20, 1980, in Montreal. Leonard was defending the World Boxing Council (WBC) Welterweight Championship for the second time. Dur√°n was the WBC No. 1 welterweight contender. Leonard abandoned his usual slick boxing style and stood flat-footed with Dur√°n. Dur√°n won by unanimous decision, with scores of 148‚Äì147, 145‚Äì144, and 146‚Äì144.  Fight The rematch took place November 25, 1980, at the Superdome in New Orleans. Leonard used his superior speed and movement to outbox and befuddle Dur√°n. \\"The whole fight, I was moving, I was moving\\", Leonard said. \\"And Voom! I snapped his head back with a jab. Voom! I snapped it back again. He tried to get me against the ropes, I'd pivot, spin off and Pow! Come under with a punch.\\" In round 7, Leonard started to taunt Dur√°n. Late in the round, winding up his right hand, as if to throw a bolo punch, Leonard snapped out a left jab and caught Dur√°n flush in the face. In the closing seconds of the eighth round, Dur√°n turned his back to Leonard and quit, waving his glove and apparently saying to referee Octavio Meyran, \\"No m√°s\\" (\\"No more\\" in Spanish). Leonard was the winner by a technical knockout (TKO) at 2:44 of round 8, regaining the WBC Welterweight Championship. Leonard led by a small margin of 68‚Äì66, 68‚Äì66, and 67‚Äì66 on the judges scorecards at the time of the TKO.Sports Illustrated December 8, 1980 Post-fight Dur√°n has said that he never said the words No mas to anyone following the bout. He blamed the broadcaster Howard Cosell for coming up with it and claiming he said it. He said he was only mumbling to himself \\"No sigo, no sigo, no sigo\\", meaning \\"I'm not carrying on\\". He has said that he quit because of stomach cramps, which started to bother him in the fifth round. He said the cramps occurred because he took off weight too quickly, then ate too much after the morning weigh-in, but his manager, Carlos Eleta, said Dur√°n always ate that way before a fight. \\"Dur√°n didn't quit because of stomach cramps\\", Eleta said. \\"He quit because he was embarrassed.\\" Leonard claimed credit for having forced Dur√°n to give up, and took great satisfaction in it. \\"I made him quit\\", Leonard said. \\"To make a man quit, to make Roberto Dur√°n quit, was better than knocking him out.\\" Dur√°n's stature in his home country, Panama, took a dramatic dive after the fight. The immediate reaction was shock, followed by anger. Within hours, commercials featuring Dur√°n (in both Panama and the United States) were ordered off the air.Roberto Dur√°n Speaks: The Untold Story Is Finally Revealed!, Bill Brubaker, New York Daily News 1981 On June 16, 1983, Dur√°n's 32nd birthday, he knocked out undefeated Davey Moore in the eighth round to win the WBA Junior Middleweight Championship.

She published her first novel, G√∂sta Berling's Saga, at the age of 33. She was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, which she was awarded in 1909. Additionally, she was the first woman to be granted a membership in The Swedish Academy in 1914.  Early life  Anna Ollson, Karlstad: Photograph of future writer Selma Lagerlof, taken in 1881 Born at M√•rbacka (now in Sunne Municipality), an estate in V√§rmland in western Sweden, Lagerl√∂f was the daughter of Erik Gustaf Lagerl√∂f, a lieutenant in the Royal V√§rmland Regiment, and Louise Lagerl√∂f (n√©e Wallroth), whose father was a well-to-do merchant and a foundry owner (brukspatron). Lagerl√∂f was the couple's fifth child out of six. She was born with a hip injury, which was caused by detachment in the hip joint. At the age of three and a half, a sickness left her lame in both legs, although she later recovered. She was a quiet child, more serious than others her age, with a deep love for reading. She was constantly writing poetry as a child, but did not publish anything officially until later in life. Her grandmother helped raise her, often telling stories of fairytales and fantasy. Growing up, she was plain and slightly lame, and an account stated that the cross-country wanderings of the majoress and Elisabet in The Saga of Gosta Berling could be the author's compensatory fantasies. As many other children of the upper class, the children of the family received their education at home, since the Volksschule system, compulsory education system, was not fully developed yet. Their teacher thus came to M√•rbacka and the children received education in English, as well as French. Selma finished reading her first novel at the age of seven. The novel was Osceola by Thomas Mayne Reid. After completing the novel, Selma is said to have decided on becoming an author when she grew up. In 1868, at the age of 10, Selma completed reading the Bible. At this time her father was very ill, and she hoped that God would heal her father if she read the Bible from cover to cover. Her father lived for another 17 years. In this manner, Selma Lagerl√∂f became accustomed to the language of Scripture from an early age. The sale of M√•rbacka following her father's illness in 1884 had a serious impact on her development. Selma's father is said to have been an alcoholic, something she rarely discussed. Her father did not want Selma to continue her education or remain involved with the women's movement. Later in life, she would buy back her father's estate with the money she received for her Nobel Prize. Lagerl√∂f lived there for the rest of her life. She also completed her studies at the Royal Seminary to become a teacher the same year as her father died.  Career  Lagerl√∂f was educated at the H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet in Stockholm from 1882 to 1885. She worked as a country schoolteacher at a high school for girls in Landskrona from 1885 to 1895, while honing her story-telling skills, with particular focus on the legends she had learned as a child. She liked the teaching profession and appreciated her students. She had a talent for capturing the children's attention through telling them stories about the different countries about which they were studying or stories about Jesus and his disciples. During this period of her life, Selma lived with her aunt Lovisa Lagerl√∂f. Through her studies at the Royal Women's Superior Training Academy in Stockholm, Lagerl√∂f reacted against the realism of contemporary Swedish-language writers such as August Strindberg. She began her first novel, G√∂sta Berling's Saga, while working as a teacher in Landskrona. Her first break as a writer came when she submitted the first chapters to a literary contest in the magazine Idun, and won a publishing contract for the whole book. At first, her writing only received mild reviews from critics. Once a popular male critic, Georg Brandes, gave her positive reviews of the Danish translation, her popularity soared. She received financial support of Fredrika Limnell, who wished to enable her to concentrate on her writing. Sophie Elkan (right) and Selma Lagerl√∂f (left) In 1894, she met the Swedish writer Sophie Elkan, who became her friend and companion. Over many years, Elkan and Lagerl√∂f critiqued each other's work. Lagerl√∂f wrote that Elkan strongly influenced her work and that she often disagreed sharply with the direction Lagerl√∂f wanted to take in her books. Selma's letters to Sophie were published in 1993, titled Du l√§r mig att bli fri (You Teach me to be Free). Selma Lagerl√∂f receives the Nobel Prize in Literature, illustration from Svenska Dagbladet, 11 December 1909. A visit in 1900 to the American Colony in Jerusalem became the inspiration for Lagerl√∂f's book by that name. The royal family and the Swedish Academy gave her substantial financial support to continue her passion. Jerusalem was also acclaimed by critics, who began comparing her to Homer and Shakespeare, so that she became a popular figure both in Sweden and abroad. By 1895, she gave up her teaching to devote herself to her writing. With the help of proceeds from G√∂sta Berlings Saga and a scholarship and grant, she made two journeys, which were largely instrumental in providing material for her next novel. With Elkan, she traveled to Italy, and she also traveled to Palestine and other parts of the East. In Italy, a legend of a Christ Child figure that had been replaced with a false version inspired Lagerl√∂f's novel Antikrists mirakler (The Miracles of the Antichrist). Set in Sicily, the novel explores the interplay between Christian and socialist moral systems. However, most of Lagerl√∂f's stories were set in V√§rmland. In 1902, Lagerl√∂f was asked by the National Teacher's Association to write a geography book for children. She wrote Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige (The Wonderful Adventures of Nils), a novel about a boy from the southernmost part of Sweden, who had been shrunk to the size of a thumb and who travelled on the back of a goose across the country. Lagerl√∂f mixed historical and geographical facts about the provinces of Sweden with the tale of the boy's adventures until he managed to return home and was restored to his normal size. The novel is one of Lagerl√∂f's most well-known books, and it has been translated into more than 30 languages. She moved in 1897 to Falun, and met Valborg Olander, who became her literary assistant and friend, but Elkan's jealousy of Olander was a complication in the relationship. Olander, a teacher, was also active in the growing women's suffrage movement in Sweden. Selma Lagerl√∂f herself was active as a speaker for the National Association for Women's Suffrage, which was beneficial for the organisation because of the great respect which surrounded Lagerl√∂f, and she spoke at the International Suffrage Congress in Stockholm in June 1911, where she gave the opening address, as well as at the victory party of the Swedish suffrage movement after women suffrage had been granted in May 1919.Hedwall, Barbro (2011).

(Swedish) Selma Lagerl√∂f was a friend of the German-Jewish writer Nelly Sachs. Shortly before her death in 1940, Lagerl√∂f intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure the release of Sachs and Sachs' aged mother from Nazi Germany, on the last flight from Germany to Sweden, and their lifelong asylum in Stockholm.  Literary adaptations  A street in Jerusalem, named for Lagerl√∂f In 1919, Lagerl√∂f sold all the movie rights to all of her as-yet unpublished works to Swedish Cinema Theatre (), so over the years, many movie versions of her works were made. During the era of Swedish silent cinema, her works were used in film by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m, Mauritz Stiller, and other Swedish film makers.Furhammar, Leif (2010), \\"Selma Lagerl√∂f and Literary Adaptations\\", Mariah Larsson and Anders Marklund (eds), \\"Swedish Film: An Introduction and Reader\\", Lund: Nordic Academic Press, pp. 86‚Äì91. Sj√∂str√∂m's retelling of Lagerl√∂f's tales about rural Swedish life, in which his camera recorded the detail of traditional village life and the Swedish landscape, provided the basis of some of the most poetic and memorable products of silent cinema. Jerusalem was adapted in 1996 into an internationally acclaimed film Jerusalem.  Awards and commemoration  Selma Lagerl√∂f on a 1959 postage stamp of the Soviet Union On 10 December 1909, Selma Lagerl√∂f won the Nobel Prize \\"in appreciation of the lofty idealism, vivid imagination, and spiritual perception that characterize her writings\\", but the decision was preceded by harsh internal power struggle within the Swedish Academy, the body that awards the Nobel Prize in literature. During her acceptance speech, she remained humble and told a fantastic story of her father, as she visited him in heaven. In the story, she asks her father for help with the debt she owes and her father explains the debt is from all the people who supported her throughout her career. In 1904, the Academy had awarded her its great gold medal, and in 1914, she also became a member of the academy. For both the academy membership and her Nobel literature prize, she was the first woman to be so honored. In 1991, she became the first woman to be depicted on a Swedish banknote, when the first 20-kronor note was released.20 Swedish Krona banknote 2008 Selma Lagerl√∂f. worldbanknotescoins.com (20 April 2015) In 1907, she received the degree of doctor of letters from Uppsala University. In 1928, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Greifswald's Faculty of Arts. At the start of World War II, she sent her Nobel Prize medal and gold medal from the Swedish Academy to the government of Finland to help raise money to fight the Soviet Union. The Finnish government was so touched that it raised the necessary money by other means and returned her medal to her. Two hotels are named after her in √ñstra √Ñmtervik in Sunne, and her home, M√•rbacka, is preserved as a museum. One of her stories, \\"The Rattrap\\", was included as a part of the Indian curriculum, for the students of class 12 CBSE in their Flamingo textbook.

Playing career Cox started his career in his native Scotland with Hibernian before joining Football League side Burnley midway through the 1888‚Äì89 season.Simpson, p. 485 He was signed to replace Robert Kay, who had just been released by the club. Cox made his Burnley debut on 10 November 1888 at Turf Moor, Burnley and he replaced Fred Poland as goalkeeper. The visitors were West Bromwich Albion. Cox played well and made some notable saves in the opening quarter-hour. Burnley took the lead after twenty minutes and only poor finishing prevented Burnley from having a larger lead at half-time. Burnley played well in the second half and got their second goal after 70 minutes. Burnley won 2‚Äì0 win and achieved their first clean sheet of the season.Simpson, p. 32 Cox kept his place in the team for the remainder of the season, and he kept clean sheets in wins against Notts County, Derby County and Aston Villa. Cox also played in both FA Cup ties played in February 1889. He played 13 League matches and Burnley finished 9th in the League conceding 62 goals in 22 games, the second worst defence that season. However, Cox did improve the defence. In the opening 9 games, before Cox was signed, Burnley conceded 38 goals from 9 games at a rate of 4.22 goals per game. From Cox making his debut until the end of the season Cox conceded 24 goals in 13 games at a rate of 1.84 goals per game.

He liberated Japanese free verse from the grip of traditional rules, and he is considered the \\"father of modern colloquial poetry in Japan\\". He published many volumes of essays, literary and cultural criticism, and aphorisms over his long career. His unique style of verse expressed his doubts about existence, and his fears, ennui, and anger through the use of dark images and unambiguous wording. Early life Hagiwara Sakutar≈ç was born in Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture as the son of a prosperous local physician. He was interested in poetry, especially in the tanka format, from an early age, and started to write poetry much against his parents' wishes, drawing on the works of Akiko Yosano for inspiration. From his early teens, he started to contribute poems to literary magazines and had his tanka verse published in the literary journals Bunk≈ç, Shinsei and My≈çj≈ç. His mother bought him his first mandolin in the summer of 1903. After spending a futile five semesters as a freshman at two national universities, he dropped out of school, living for a period in Okayama and Kumamoto. In 1911, when his father was still trying to get him to enter college again, he began studying the mandolin in Tokyo, with the thought of becoming a professional musician. He later established a mandolin orchestra in his hometown Maebashi. His bohemian lifestyle was criticized by his childhood colleagues, and some of his early poems include spiteful remarks about his native Maebashi. Literary career In 1913, Hagiwara published five of his verses in Zamboa (\\"Shaddock\\"), a magazine edited by Kitahara Hakush≈´, who became his mentor and friend. He also contributed verse to Maeda Yugure's Shiika (\\"Poetry\\") and Chij≈ç Junrei (\\"Earth Pilgrimage\\"), another journal created by Hakush≈´. The following year, he joined Mur≈ç Saisei and the Christian minister Yamamura Boch≈ç in creating the Ningyo Shisha (\\"Merman Poetry Group\\"), dedicated to the study of music, poetry, and religion. The three writers called their literary magazine, Takuj≈ç Funsui (\\"Tabletop Fountain\\"), and published the first edition in 1915. In 1915, Hagiwara attempted suicide because of his continued ill-health and alcoholism. However, in 1916, Hagiwara co-founded with Mur≈ç Saisei the literary magazine Kanj≈ç (\\"Sentiment\\"). The magazine was centered on the \\"new style\\" of modern Japanese poetry that Hagiwara was developing, in contrast to the highly intellectual and more traditionally structured poems in other contemporary literary magazines. In 1917, Hagiwara brought out his first free- verse collection, Tsuki ni Hoeru (\\"Howling at the Moon\\"), which had an introduction by Kitahara Hakush≈´. The work created a sensation in literary circles. Hagiwara rejected the symbolism and use of unusual words, with consequent vagueness of Hakush≈´ and other contemporary poets in favor of precise wording which appealed rhythmically or musically to the ears. The work met with much critical acclaim, especially for its bleak style, conveying an attitude of pessimism and despair based on modern Western psychological concept of existential angst influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche. Hagiwara's second anthology, Aoneko (\\"Blue Cat\\") was published in 1923 to even greater acclaim and Tsuki ni Hoeru. The poems in this anthology incorporated concepts from Buddhism with the nihilism of Arthur Schopenhauer. Hagiwara subsequently published a number of other volumes of cultural and literary criticism. He was also a scholar of classical verse and published Shi no Genri (\\"Principles of Poetry\\", 1928). His critical study Ren'ai meika shu (\\"A Collection of Best-Loved Love Poems\\", 1931), shows that he had a deep appreciation for classical Japanese poetry, and Ky≈çshu no shijin Yosa Buson (\\"Yosa Buson‚ÄîPoet of Nostalgia\\", 1936) reveals his respect for the haiku poet Buson, who advocated a return to the 17th century rules of Bash≈ç. Hy≈çt≈ç (\\"Icy Island\\") published in 1934 was Hagiwara's last major anthology of poetry. He abandoned the use of both free verse and colloquial Japanese, and returned to a more traditional structure with a realistic content. The poems are occasionally autobiographical, and exhibit a sense of despair and loneliness. The work received only mixed reviews. For most of his life, Hagiwara relied on his wealthy family for financial support. However, he taught at Meiji University from 1934 until his death in 1942.  Death  After more than six months of struggle with what appeared to be lung cancer but which doctors diagnosed as acute pneumonia, he died in May 1942‚Äînot quite six months short of his 56th birthday. His grave is at the temple of Jujun-ji, in his native Maebashi. Personal life Hagiwara married Ueda Ineko in 1919; they had two daughters, Y≈çko (1920‚Äì2005), also a writer, and Akirako (b. 1922). Ineko deserted her family for a younger man in June 1929 and ran off to Hokkaid≈ç and Sakutar≈ç formally divorced her in October. He married again in 1938 to Otani Mitsuko, but after only eighteen months Sakutar≈ç's mother‚Äîwho had never registered the marriage in the family register (koseki)‚Äîdrove her away.

Anthelmintics or antihelminthics are a group of antiparasitic drugs that expel parasitic worms (helminths) and other internal parasites from the body by either stunning or killing them and without causing significant damage to the host. They may also be called vermifuges (those that stun) or vermicides (those that kill). Anthelmintics are used to treat people who are infected by helminths, a condition called helminthiasis. These drugs are also used to treat infected animals. Pills containing anthelmintics are used in mass deworming campaigns of school-aged children in many developing countries. The drugs of choice for soil-transmitted helminths are mebendazole and albendazole; for schistosomiasis and tapeworms it is praziquantel. Types Antiparasitics that specifically target worms of the genus Ascaris are called ascaricides. * Benzimidazoles: ** Albendazole ‚Äì effective against threadworms, roundworms, whipworms, tapeworms, hookworms ** Mebendazole ‚Äì effective against various nematodes ** Thiabendazole ‚Äì effective against various nematodes ** Fenbendazole ‚Äì effective against various parasites ** Triclabendazole ‚Äì effective against liver flukes ** Flubendazole ‚Äì effective against most intestinal parasites * Abamectin (and by extension ivermectin) - effective against most common intestinal worms, except tapeworms, for which praziquantel is commonly used in conjunction for mass dewormings * Diethylcarbamazine ‚Äì effective against Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Loa loa. * Pyrantel pamoate ‚Äì effective against most nematode infections residing within the intestines * Levamisole * Salicylanilide ‚Äì mitochondrial un- couplers (used only for flatworm infections): **Niclosamide **Oxyclozanide * Nitazoxanide ‚Äì readily kills Ascaris lumbricoides, and also possess antiprotozoal effects * Praziquantel ‚Äì effective against flatworms (e.g., tapeworms and schistosoma) * Octadepsipeptides (e.g. Emodepside) ‚Äì effective against a variety of gastrointestinal helminths * Monepantel (aminoacetonitrile class) - effective against a variety of nematodes including those resistant to other anthelmintic classes * Spiroindoles (e.g. derquantel) - effective against a variety of nematodes including those resistant to other anthelmintic classes * Artemisinin ‚Äì shows anthelmintic activityVeterinary Parasitology Anthelmintic resistance The ability of parasites to survive treatments that are generally effective at the recommended doses is a major threat to the future control of worm parasites in small ruminants and horses. This is especially true of nematodes, and has helped spur development of aminoacetonitrile derivatives for treatment against drug-resistant nematodes, as well as exploration of doxycycline to kill their endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. The resistance is measured by the \\"fecal egg count reduction\\" value which varies for different types of helminths. Treatment with an antihelminthic drug kills worms whose phenotype renders them susceptible to the drug, but resistant parasites survive and pass on their \\"resistance\\" genes. Resistant varieties accumulate, and treatment failure finally occurs.

Presidential board During the Presidential board meeting of the GSCA (Grand Slam Chess Association) in Linares on 7 March 2009, the GSCA Presidential board was chosen: * Juan Fernandez (Linares) ‚Äì President * Silvio Danailov (Sofia) ‚Äì Executive Director * Jeroen van den Berg (Wijk aan Zee) ‚Äì Spokesman * Andoni Madallaga (Bilbao) ‚Äì General Secretary History Negotiations between the organisers of major tournaments M-Tel Masters, Tata Steel Chess Tournament (under the name Corus) and Linares began in March 2006, seeking to create a cycle of tournaments to raise the popularity of chess and attract increased sponsorship for major events. Several rounds of talks took place over the next 14 months. The GSCA was established on 17 January 2007, and the first edition of the series for 2008 announced in May, with Mexico City added to the list and Bilbao confirmed as Masters Final hosts. Due to problems raising funding for the tournament, it was announced on 16 May 2008 that Mexico City was cancelled. On 16 March 2009, the members of the GSCA Presidential Board was published, confirming the addition of Pearl Spring in Nanjing, China as Grand Slam hosts as well as interest from San Luis, Argentina and London. The M-Tel Masters was held for the last time during this series. During the 2010 series, marking the last edition of Linares due to financial problems and the cancellation of M-Tel Masters due to the World Chess Championship, held in Sofia that year, it was agreed that Kings Tournament held in Medias, Romania would join the 2011 edition. For the Bilbao Chess Masters Final 2010, the qualifiers were Magnus Carlsen (winner of the 2009 Pearl Spring, 2010 Corus and 2010 Bazna King tournaments) and Veselin Topalov (winner of 2010 Linares). Because the M-Tel Masters was cancelled in 2010 due to the World Chess Championship 2010, the winner of the World Chess Championship, Viswanathan Anand was named an automatic qualifier. After Topalov withdrew from the final, the remaining two places were decided during a preliminary tournament in China in early September involving Vladimir Kramnik, Levon Aronian (the highest two rated players not having already qualified for the final), Alexei Shirov (nominee of host nation Spain) and Wang Hao (nominee of host nation China). Shirov and Kramnik qualified for the final. The final was the strongest tournament (by rating) in chess history, and it was won by Kramnik, followed by Anand, Carlsen and Shirov. For the 2011 Grand Slam final, the qualifiers to date are Carlsen (winner of 2010 Pearl Spring), Hikaru Nakamura (winner of 2011 Tata Steel), Sergey Karjakin (second of 2011 Bazna Kings, Carlsen is winner), World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand and Levon Aronian (the highest rated player not having already qualified for the final). The remaining place has yet to be determined. Karjakin didn't participate. Ivanchuk replaced him. Vallejo Pons, host player, was the last. At the end of the 2012 edition of Tata Steel the rest of the 2012 series was confirmed and announced that the 2011 winners of Tal Memorial and London Chess Classic qualified for the 2012 Bilbao Final.

The fighting took place on a key position on the Jamestown Line known as The Hook and saw the defending UN troops, including the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) from the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade and the US 7th Marine Regiment, fight off numerous assaults by the PVA 137th Division during two concerted night attacks, inflicting numerous casualties on the PVA with heavy artillery and small arms fire.

With the peace talks in Panmunjom reaching a conclusion, the Chinese had been eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the battle was the last of the war before the official signing of the Korean Armistice. During the action the PVA had attempted to make a breakthrough to the Imjin River along the divisional boundary between the US 1st Marine Division and the 1st Commonwealth Division in order to turn the Marine division's flank. Yet with well-coordinated indirect fires from the divisional artillery, including 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, and support from British Centurion tanks of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, 2 RAR successfully thwarted both assaults, holding The Hook. It was estimated that PVA casualties numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 killed, with the majority of them inflicted by the New Zealand gunners. Meanwhile, on the left flank, US Marines had endured the brunt of the attack, repelling the PVA onslaught with infantry and artillery. Only a few hours later the Armistice Agreement was signed, ultimately ending the war. Both sides subsequently withdrew within 72 hours to create the Korean Demilitarised Zone. Background Military situation Following the Battle of Maryang San in early October 1951 the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade remained in defence for the rest of the month. Amid heavy fighting on the afternoon of 4 November the PVA recaptured Hill 317, which was by then held by the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, in an action for which Private Bill Speakman was later awarded the Victoria Cross. The hill remained in PVA hands until the end of the war. The Battle of Maryang San subsequently proved to be one of the last UN actions in the war of manoeuvre, and with peace talks ongoing the fighting was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences, trench lines, bunkers, patrols, wiring parties and minefields reminiscent of the Western Front in 1915‚Äì17. Construction of defensive localities sited in all-round defence with interlocking arcs of fire began almost immediately, although such operations were confined to the reverse slopes during the day due to artillery and mortar fire which made such operations hazardous. Patrolling and ambushing by both sides also began in order to prevent the other from gaining control of no man's land. The 1st Commonwealth Division, which included British, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and Indian troops, subsequently occupied part of the Jamestown Line‚Äîa UN defensive position which extended across central Korea‚Äîin the US I Corps sector on the US Eighth Army's left flank. The war was no less bloody though, and the division remained in the line for all but two of the remaining nineteen months of the war. alt=The snow covered ridgeline of a steep hill running away from the camera and sloping downwards from left to right.

From 19 January 1952, the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) was in defence on the Jamestown Line as part of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade before going into reserve on 18 April, where they remained until the end of June. Meanwhile, in early 1952 the Australian government had agreed to an American request to increase its forces in Korea, dispatching a second infantry battalion to join 3 RAR which had been fighting since September 1950. The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) arrived in Korea on 6 April 1952, with both battalions forming part of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade under the command of an Australian brigadier. The brigade re-entered the line on 30 June and 1 RAR spent the following fourteen weeks patrolling, ambushing and raiding, before the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade again went into reserve on 5 October. The brigade returned to the Jamestown Line in early November, with 1 RAR taking over the defences on Hill 355 from the Canadians. The Australians were subsequently forced to clean up large quantities of rubbish left by the Canadians as well as repairing and camouflaging the defences which had recently been attacked by the PVA. 1 RAR implemented an aggressive patrol program in an effort to regain control of no-man's land from the PVA, which had been allowed to establish hides close to the perimeter. Several PVA outposts were subsequently destroyed during raids of up to company-size. 3 RAR took over the defences on Hill 355 on 28 December 1952 and remained there until the 1st Commonwealth Division went into reserve at the end January 1953. On 21 March, 1 RAR was replaced in Korea by the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR), after nearly twelve months operational service. Heavy fighting occurred in March, with the PVA moving back over to a limited offensive in the US I Corps sector, in an attempt to regain the initiative following the winter. Heavy fighting occurred around The Hook, which was by then held by the US 2nd Infantry Division following the relief of the 1st Commonwealth Division, the Old Baldy and Pork Chop Hill features held by the US 7th Division and in the western sector held by the US 1st Marine Division around the Vegas and Nevada Complex. Peace talks finally resumed at Panmunjom on 6 April and an agreement was soon made to exchange sick and wounded prisoners. Consequently, 648 UN and 6,670 PVA and North Korean prisoners were subsequently repatriated as part of Operation Little Switch on 20 April, including five Australians For a while the tempo of operations slackened, returning to the small-scale raids and probes of the winter months. Yet during the final three months of the war the PVA launched a series of offensives prior to the signing of a ceasefire agreement. In early April 1953 the 1st Commonwealth Division returned to the Jamestown Line. By this time the division was commanded by Major General Michael West, a British officer who had taken over command in September the previous year. The 28th British Commonwealth Brigade subsequently occupied the north-eastern sector. 2 RAR occupied Hill 159 during 5 May to 16 June, while 3 RAR held Hill 355 during the period 7‚Äì27 May. 3 RAR then relieved 2 RAR on 16 June and remained on Hill 159 until 10 July. Meanwhile, The Hook was a key position on the left flank of the line held by the 1st Commonwealth Division and was the division's most threatened sector on the Jamestown Line. Held by the 29th British Infantry Brigade, the position consisted of a group of hills west of the Samichon River which dominated the Imjin River, to the south, and provided observation and fields of fire over a bend in the river as it turned towards Seoul. Loss of The Hook would force the UN troops to withdraw nearly to the next tenable defensive line on the high ground south of the Imjin River. As a result, the PVA had made repeated attacks against it, with the 1st Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry repulsing the first PVA attempt in late-March 1952. the 1st Marine Division defended the area in the First Battle of the Hook in October 1952. The 1st Battalion, The Black Watch did so again in November 1952, while the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment had fought the heaviest battle there in May 1953 during the Third Battle of the Hook. alt=A Caucasian soldier wearing a camouflage helmet and thick winter clothing lies on his side in a trench facing the right of the photo, holding a canteen in his left hand and using an entrenching tool with his right hand. The soldier is surrounded by rolls of communication line, jerries and boxes of equipment. Behind him, the skyline can be seen above the top of the earth works. In the western sector, American outposts such as Detroit, Berlin, East Berlin, Reno, Carson, Elko and Vegas had been bitterly contested over the previous months by the US 1st Marine Division and the Turkish Brigade but by June the Reno, Elko and Vegas positions were held by the PVA. The front subsequently returned to its usual defensive routine, but following a temporary break-down in negotiations after the unilateral release of 25,000 anti-communist Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war by President of South Korea Syngman Rhee, the PVA had renewed large-scale attacks on 24 June. Concentrating on the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) divisions in the eastern and central sectors, the PVA launched another offensive in June in an attempt to convince the South Korean leader to come to terms. The fighting continued until the end of the month as the PVA successively drove back elements of ROK 9th Division in the US IX Corps sector and the ROK 1st Division in the US I Corps sector. By early July the PVA launched a major offensive in the ROK II Corps and US X Corps sectors. The Americans and ROK subsequently responded with a series of counter-attacks to regain the ground lost, yet these met with only limited success. On 6 July the PVA attacked elements of the US 7th Division on Pork Chop Hill on the US I Corps' right flank, and succeeded in gaining the crest. The Americans were reinforced and counter-attacked over the following days, although again without success. Following another PVA assault on 9 July the Americans again counter-attacked, yet neither side gained a clear advantage. The following day the PVA launched a series of company and battalion-sized assaults, but were repulsed. Yet, with the Americans unprepared to accept further casualties for limited tactical gain, they evacuated Pork Chop Hill on 11 July. Prelude alt=Five young Caucasian men in uniform wearing helmets sit below ground in a trench, facing the camera. The trench is central to the photograph and runs away from it, with the edges of the earthworks on each side. In the background, the skyline can be seen to the rear of the men, framed by the edges of the trench which are covered in roots, grass and other vegetation. The peace talks resumed in early July as Rhee's position apparently softened, yet this proved the impetus for a final PVA offensive as they sought to further influence the talks and improve their defensive positions at the same time. On 14 July elements of five PVA armies struck six South Korean divisions around the Kumsong salient. By 20 July the ROK Capital Division and much of the ROK 3rd Division had been practically destroyed, exposing serious weaknesses despite two years of American training. The ROK fell back and the UN line was penetrated to a depth of . Only American intervention restored the situation and ultimately nine ROK and US divisions were required to stem the PVA offensive and regain some of the lost ground. Following a counter-attack by ROK II Corps a new defensive line was established south of the Kumsong River. Meanwhile, in conjunction with the main offensive at Kumsong, the PVA 19th Army Group had conducted a series of limited offensives against US I Corps, with the 46th Army conducting assaulting 1st Marine Division outposts from 7 to 27 July. PVA losses were heavy nonetheless, and they sustained more than 28,000 casualties for only temporary gain. During the second week of July, West had re-shuffled his brigades to allow the 29th British Infantry Brigade to recuperate in the 1st Commonwealth Division's central sector. The 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, under the command of an Australian officer, Brigadier John Wilton, subsequently took over the battered defences on The Hook on 9‚Äì10 July 1953, on the division's left. The brigade was the strongest in the division, consisting of the two Australian battalions‚Äî2 RAR and 3 RAR‚Äîand two British battalions‚Äîthe 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (1 DLI) and 1st Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (1 RF)‚Äîas well as supporting artillery and armour in direct support. Among the latter was the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery (16 RNZA) and C Squadron of the British 1st Royal Tank Regiment equipped with Centurion tanks. The 25th Canadian Brigade was subsequently handed the responsibility for the equally exposed positions on Hills 355 and 159 on the right. The ROK 1st Division held the line on the 1st Commonwealth Division's right flank, while the 1st Marine Division, under the overall command of Major General Randolph Pate, held the Nevada Complex on the left flank, having taken over the line on 7‚Äì8 July. On the American right, the 7th Marine Regiment under Colonel Glenn C. Funk occupied a linear defensive position, with two battalions forward and one back. The 5th Marine Regiment occupied the central sector, while the 1st Marine Regiment held the rear in divisional reserve. Indirect fire support was provided by the 11th Marine Regiment. Meanwhile, by May 1953 the PVA 1st, 46th, 63rd, 64th and 65th Armies of the 19th Army Group were operating against the US I Corps under the overall command of Huang Yongsheng. Wilton deployed the stronger Australian battalions forward, with 2 RAR occupying the left forward position on The Hook, while 3 RAR was deployed on the right, overlooking the Samichon River. 1 DLI was on the opposite side of the Samichon, while 1 RF was held in reserve as a brigade counter-penetration force. 2 RAR was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Larkin, while 3 RAR was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur MacDonald. Larkin deployed 2 RAR with three companies forward, and one back in reserve as a counter-attack force. In the centre, The Hook was held by B Company, while C Company held the left and A Company the right, with D Company in reserve. MacDonald deployed 3 RAR with two companies forward and two in depth. A Company occupied Hill 146, on the boundary with 2 RAR, B Company held the south-eastern tip of the ridge, and C and D Companies were held in reserve. British Centurion tanks were also deployed forward to support the Australians. Directly confronting the Australians on The Hook was the PVA 137th Division, 46th Army which had been in the line since February 1953, under the command of Cheng Dengzhi. alt=A deep trench line runs vertically from the top to the bottom of the photography, while on either side is a bare earth bund. Nine Caucasian soldiers carrying weapons, ammunition, and other equipment, many with their faces blacked and wearing camouflage on their heads, move in a straight line down the trench towards the bottom of the photo, below the camera. At the bottom right of the photo, a soldier stands level with the camera facing the right at the head of the patrol. The positions occupied by the Australians had been badly damaged by the PVA assaults and bombardments in May and June, and recent rain had also collapsed some trenches and weakened many of the wire obstacles. Yet the extensive tunnel system, dug by the Canadians the previous winter, remained intact and afforded some protection. Efforts to repair the defences and assert control in no-man's land began immediately, with an aggressive patrolling program by the Australians leading to numerous clashes with PVA patrols, while they also endured heavy shelling during this time. By day it was hot and humid making conditions in the bunkers uncomfortable, while by night the defenders worked hard digging, wiring and laying minefields. The PVA focused most of their attention on the 7th Marine Regiment, which was occupying positions south-west of 2 RAR after having relieved the Turkish Brigade there, and thereby allowed the Australians some time to prepare. Light mortaring hit 2 RAR on 11 July, while one 3 RAR soldier was killed instantly by a shell when he was observed walking along the crest-line by a PVA position less than from the Australian perimeter. The gun crew was subsequently silenced by Australian sniper fire. Patrolling by the Australians continued in order to prevent the PVA from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the PVA were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of PVA forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, while at the same time rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, PVA harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing a constant stream of casualties among the Australians. Intense PVA shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected PVA assault in the 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of PVA troops across the 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull. On 22 July B Company, 2 RAR was relieved on The Hook by D Company, and subsequently moved into reserve. The following day, with the ceasefire believed to be imminent, Wilton limited patrols to only those considered essential for the security of his forward positions. Rumours spread quickly among the troops that the truce was expected to be signed on 26 July. However, by 24 July the PVA shelling had once again grown in intensity, while large bodies of PVA infantry were increasingly seen on the forward slopes by the Australians. Meanwhile, similar concentrations of PVA were also reported by the Marines. With the PVA eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the tactical advantage offered to the side that held The Hook after the truce, simultaneous attacks were soon launched against 2 RAR and the 7th Marine Regiment on the left flank, in two major actions on the nights of 24/25 and 25/26 July. Battle First night, 24/25 July 1953 alt=A black and white map depicting UN outposts which are located in a line centrally on the left of the map, including Carson, Reno, Elko, Vegas, Berlin, East Berlin and Detroit and The Hook, which is depicted to their right in the middle of the map.

To the bottom right is the town of Choksong, which is depicted to the south of the river. On the evening of 24 July a 50-strong PVA force probed 2 RAR's forward outposts after dark, attacking C Company on Hill 121 and surrounding a bunker on the left flank, while the Marines had a similar contact on the left flank. A forward Australian standing patrol from D Company subsequently clashed heavily with the PVA probe, losing five wounded before directing tank and artillery fire which dispersed their attackers. These attacks had been preceded by heavy artillery and mortar fire, with the PVA subjecting C and D Companies, 2 RAR and the 2 RAR Mortar Platoon to a heavy bombardment. Waves of PVA attacked the Australians at 20:50, penetrating between C Company on Hill 121 and the nearest Marines on Hill 111, before being turned back amidst the driving rain. A further attack followed another barrage at 23:25, but was again repelled and faltered before reaching the wire during fierce fighting with grenades and small-arms, with the assault failing largely due to the weight of defensive artillery fire. More than 2,000 PVA mortar and artillery rounds fell on the Australian positions during the night. Two Australians were killed and 14 wounded during the night attack which was later estimated to have been made by a PVA regiment of up to 4,000 men. The defenders were soaking wet and exhausted, but had held their positions. Yet despite the weight of the PVA attack against the Australians their main objective had been Hill 119, another strong point in the American sector to the south-west of Hill 111, known as Boulder City, held by the 7th Marine Regiment. The PVA engaged the Marines on Boulder City with preparatory fire from mortars and artillery at 19:30. Ten minutes later PVA troops were observed massing for an assault north-west of the Berlin feature and were subsequently shelled by the Americans. At 20:30 the PVA probed the right flank held by the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, first striking Hill 111 and then at Boulder City. After infiltrating forward, the PVA had hid in the paddy fields immediately in front of the American positions during the barrage, and had then rapidly assaulted as soon as the artillery had lifted. The attack coincided with the ongoing relief in place of the defenders by the 1st Marine Regiment under the command of Colonel Wallace M. Nelson, and it subsequently succeeded in temporarily penetrating the American positions on Hill 111. Yet the PVA main effort fell on Boulder City, and two battalions subsequently succeeded in occupying a portion of the American trench line. From these positions the PVA threatened to cut-off Company G, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines on Hill 119, repeatedly assaulting the Berlin Gate feature on the company's left flank and the East Berlin Gate on its right in an effort to exploit their gains. Throughout the fighting the Marines were strongly supported by heavy mortar, artillery and tank fire; however, due to the prevailing weather conditions no spotter aircraft were able to fly during the night which limited the effectiveness of the indirect fire available to them. In support of the Marines on Hill 111 at 21:10 Wilton had ordered one company of the 1 DLI to occupy a reserve position on the left of 2 RAR, in the rear of the 1st Marine Division where they ultimately remained for the rest of the evening. A reserve company from 3 RAR was also embussed in order to be ready to respond to any emergency. The Americans eventually drove off the PVA probes after their artillery broke up the attack, but not before they were forced to abandon some of their forward positions. With the attack likely only a diversionary effort, by 21:20 the bulk of the PVA had begun to withdraw from Hill 111. Meanwhile, the fighting on Hill 119 continued. A heavy bombardment fell on the American positions at 21:00, followed by a second assault on Hill 119 by two PVA companies which succeeded in penetrating the Marine perimeter. Hand-to-hand combat developed across the forward trenches and in the ensuing fighting Company G was reduced to half-strength, while their ammunition began to run low. Under pressure, by midnight the Americans were forced back another to the reverse slope. 3 RAR was subsequently left exposed, with the forward PVA elements moving to within of the battalion's A Echelon area. Almost surrounded, the position was at risk of becoming untenable. At 00:15 Company I, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines was ordered to reinforce Boulder City; they lost heavily after the PVA intercepted a coded message and adjusted mortar and artillery fire onto the Marines as they approached the rear of Hill 119. In response the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment launched an intense counter-battery barrage. A U.S. Army M39 Armored Utility Vehicle assists U.S. Marines picking up casualties on 25 July 1953 during an attack against Hill 111, also known as \\"Boulder City.\\" The PVA also launched several assaults in the central sector against the 5th Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Harvey C. Tschirgi. Successively striking outposts on the regimental right flank from 21:15, a reinforced PVA company from the 408th Regiment then concentrated against outpost Esther, held by Marines from Company H. Amid heavy fighting both sides were reinforced. By early morning the PVA had seized parts of the forward trench-line and moved to isolate the position with indirect fire and patrols which penetrated between the outpost and the main defensive position to the rear; the Marines still controlled the rear trenches and, reorganising their defence, succeeded in checking the PVA assault. Defending strongly, the Marines used flamethrowers, machine-guns and mortars, supported by M46 Patton tanks and artillery fire and following several hours of fighting the PVA attack was finally broken up by indirect fire. An entire PVA battalion had been committed piecemeal to the attack, yet by 06:40 the following day the Marines reported Esther secure. More than 4,000 artillery and mortar rounds had fallen on the outpost during the night; Marine casualties included 12 killed and 35 wounded, while PVA loses included 85 dead which were counted around the position, 110 more believed killed and an estimated 250 wounded. In the 7th Marine Regiment's sector, heavy shelling, small arms fire and hand-to-hand fighting continued around Boulder City into the early morning on 25 July. PVA infantry had succeeded in breaking through and occupying a large part of the trench-line on the forward slopes, and for a while even temporarily occupied the crest. At 01:30 Companies G and I, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines launched a rapid counter- attack and by 03:30 the American perimeter had been re-established, and was subsequently reinforced. By 05:30 Hill 119 was secured by the Marines, although scattered groups of PVA remained on the forward slopes, while others attempted to reinforce the left flank. Sporadic fighting and heavy shelling also continued on Hill 111 in the early morning hours, and at 04:00 another fight developed; by 05:30 the position was also controlled by the Americans. Four M46 Patton tanks on Boulder City dispersed the PVA concentrations with high explosive and machine-gun fire, while Marine infantry assault teams with flamethrowers and 3.5-inch rocket launchers subsequently cleared the remaining PVA from their former bunkers. In total, more than 3,000 PVA troops had assaulted the front held by the 1st Marine Division during the night of 24/25 July. Throughout the night the 11th Marine Regiment had been heavily engaged, with the regiment and the 10 battalions under its operational control in the 1st Marine Division sector firing a total of 23,725 rounds, including those from batteries of the US 25th Infantry Division Artillery, the US I Corps Artillery and the 1st Commonwealth Divisional Artillery. The weight of indirect fire available to the defenders had been significant and the whole of the 1st Commonwealth Divisional Artillery (80 guns) had also been engaged during the fighting, firing in support of both the Australians on Hill 121 and the Marines on their left flank, defending Hill 111 and Boulder City. Unhindered by the restrictions on ammunition usage which had applied to the Marines during this period, the supporting fires of the British-Commonwealth 25-pounder field guns proved of considerable assistance. A liaison officer from 16 RNZA was sent subsequently over to the Marine artillery regiment during the night to establish communication. More than 13,000 rounds were fired by the British and New Zealand gunners that night, with the close defensive fire having a devastating effect on the assaulting PVA infantry. The artillery had also effectively halted the PVA assault against Hill 121, resulting in a fair degree of frustration among the Australian infantry, some of whom later expressed disappointment at being prevented from getting to grips with the PVA by the accurate New Zealand artillery fire. Before the battle, a section from the 2 RAR Medium Machine Gun Platoon had been stationed within the American perimeter near Hill 111 to provide covering fire across the area between the positions occupied by the Marines and the Australians. Commanded by Sergeant Brian Cooper they soon found themselves in the thick of the fighting, firing their Vickers machine guns in support of the Australian positions and to defend themselves from the weight of the PVA main attack which fell on the Marines. Three men were wounded during the night but the machine-gunners continued to fire in support, while the remainder of the section repelled PVA assaults from the left. Ultimately the PVA were unable to dislodge them, with the Australians calling-in artillery on to their own positions during repeated PVA attempts to overrun them as the Marines withdrew past their position, leaving them isolated. When dawn came dozens of Chinese bodies were found strewn in front of the Australian machine-gunners. As the Marines worked to clear the PVA stragglers from their position the Australians had endeavoured to coax a PVA soldier from a bunker, yet when he resisted they were forced to kill him with a grenade. Cooper was later awarded the Military Medal for his leadership, with the stubborn defence of the Australians contributing to the break-up of the PVA attack which at one stage had threatened to overrun the Marine position. Large groups of PVA remained though, occupying a number bunkers and trenches, and they were not finally dislodged by the Marines until the following afternoon.

To the bottom left, two bombs are falling away from the aircraft towards an unseen target in the fields below. At 08:20 on the morning of 25 July the PVA again assaulted the Marines on Hill 119 in company strength, but were soon halted by American artillery and mortar fire which inflicted heavy losses; skirmishing continued for the remainder of the day. While no major assaults against Hill 111 occurred, a heavy PVA barrage targeted the position at 11:00. F9F Panthers provided air support to the Marines throughout the day, while American tanks continued to engage PVA targets in support of the defenders on Hill 111 and Boulder City. Finally, at 13:35 the last of the PVA infantry were forced off the forward slopes of Boulder City by the Marines. PVA casualties were estimated by the Americans to have included another 75 killed and 425 wounded. The PVA continued to heavily shell the American positions, and by late afternoon 13,500 mortar and artillery rounds had fallen on the sector held by 7th Marine Regiment. The Americans fired many counter- battery missions in response, firing 36,794 rounds. The ongoing relief of the 7th Marine Regiment continued throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Australian positions on The Hook were also heavily shelled throughout the day, forcing many of the defenders underground into the network of tunnels then being extended by a team of New Zealand sappers. Realising that they had only faced a series of probes the previous night, rather than a major attack, and as these actions may have been in preparation for a heavier attack, a vigorous defence was subsequently prepared by the Australians with the reserve companies moved into blocking positions to strengthen the forward defences. The defenders endured steady shelling and harassing fire, while after dark The Hook was probed again, this time by a group of about 20 PVA. The force was subsequently engaged by an Australian standing patrol from D Company at 21:00 and forced to withdraw, leaving behind one dead at a cost of one Australian killed and one wounded. At 21:20 the PVA fire became more intense, and a heavy blow was launched by the PVA against the Marines on Hill 119 shortly after. Beginning at 21:30, elements of the 1st and 7th Marines were attacked by two PVA companies. A heavy concentration by the entire US I Corps artillery was fired in response, and the PVA were forced to withdraw. At 23:00 the PVA shelling intensified to thirty-rounds per minute, and was followed fifteen minutes later by another determined charge by PVA infantry against the Marines on the left flank on Hill 111 and Boulder City during a furious attack. The Australian positions were not directly attacked during the night, although C Company engaged the PVA in no-man's land sporadically at long range in support of the Americans. As on the previous night, 3 RAR was not attacked. In total more than 4,200 mortar and artillery rounds were fired by the PVA at 2 RAR during the night, and three Australians were killed and nine wounded. alt=A large group of soldiers, some standing and some sitting, in a clearing below a hill covered in low grass and a few trees which can be seen in the background.

Soldiers work around the vehicles, unloading stores. In contrast, the Marines were more heavily engaged, with the fighting occurring at close quarters for more than an hour before they repelled their attackers and counter-attacked. An Australian bunker between the Marines on Hill 111 and C Company, 2 RAR on Hill 121 was also the scene of heavy fighting, after the PVA penetrated the undefended space between the two positions. Manned by just six Australians under the command of Lance Corporal Kenneth Crockford, the position was attacked by the PVA simultaneously from several sides following a determined charge at 23:40. During bitter hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches around the bunker the under-strength Australian section ejected the PVA and prevented them from advancing any further. They then directed artillery fire onto their position to break up subsequent attacks. Further PVA probes were launched against Hills 111 and 119 in the early hours of 26 July, and they succeeded in temporarily seizing parts of the American trench line. Between 01:30 and 03:00 heavy fighting continued before the PVA were driven from the position by the Marines. Meanwhile, Wilton ordered D Company, 3 RAR to move across to occupy the position behind B Company, 2 RAR to support the Marines if required, while at 02:18 he placed A Company, 1 DLI on five minutes notice to move to another blocking position. American casualties were 19 killed and 125 wounded, while PVA losses included 30 men counted dead, and another 84 estimated to have been killed and 310 wounded. The 2 RAR Machine Gun Platoon on Hill 111 again found itself heavily engaged, suffering five badly wounded. The PVA had managed to establish an artillery forward observer on Hill 111 and Marine casualties were particularly heavy as a result. Eight critically injured Americans were subsequently evacuated through 2 RAR for urgent medical treatment. Small-arms fire continued to be exchanged between the Marines and the PVA for the next two hours, only subsiding by 03:00, with the Marines finally driving out the PVA. D Company, 3 RAR was subsequently released and it returned to battalion's main defensive position. The Australian outpost section also succeeded in holding through the night and the following morning they found 35 PVA dead around their positions. During the fighting Crockford had repeatedly exposed himself to PVA fire, and had even run across no-man's land to provide situation reports to the Marine command post on Hill 111. He was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. By dawn the only activity in front of The Hook were PVA stretcher bearers collecting their wounded, which were subsequently allowed to do so unmolested by the Australians. In the 1st Marine Division's sector the fighting had also ceased, while small groups of PVA moved to reinforce their positions and were engaged with rifle and machine-gun fire. alt=A black and white photo of damaged field defences in the daylight.

As with the first night, indirect fire had again played a crucial role in the defence, with the New Zealand gunners firing another 5,700 rounds (out of a divisional total of 9,500 rounds) in support of the Australians and the Marines. Dug-in to the east, 16 RNZA had been forced to fire with minimum crest clearance over the Australian lines in order to bring effective fire to bear on the assaulting PVA from their 25-pounders. Using both variable time proximity and time-set fuses, the New Zealand gunners used air bursts to break up the PVA assaults, causing heavy casualties. Despite the risk of causing casualties among their own soldiers no serious casualties were incurred by the Australians, although one suffered a broken shoulder after a brass nose cone from a faulty time-of-flight fused shell exploded over his position. High explosive was also provided by C Company's 60 mm mortar which operated against the PVA in no-man's land despite being exposed and unprotected from fire, while the mortars also provided battlefield illumination which had allowed the Australian riflemen and machine-gunners to bring accurate fire to bear on the PVA crossing 2 RAR's front to attack Hills 111 and 121. The PVA had suffered heavily during the fighting, with over 300 dead counted in front of Hill 111 alone. Throughout the following day the Australians observed a steady stream of PVA casualties evacuating Hill 111 and crossing the paddy fields on the left flank. Later, a group of 20 PVA had also attempted to withdraw but were engaged by the 2 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon, resulting in at least six casualties. In the area held by the 1st Marine Division, PVA shelling continued sporadically, while at 13:30 the 1st Marine Regiment assumed operational control of the right sector. Aftermath Casualties The battle illustrated the power of concentrated artillery fire and the wastefulness of massed attacks by infantry against modern firepower. Hundreds of PVA dead lay in front of the UN positions, with the valley floor \\"almost covered with dead Chinese\\". Wilton later recounted that on \\"the approaches to 2 RAR the bodies literally carpeted the ground sometimes two deep\\". Later, it was estimated that PVA casualties numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 killed, with the majority of them inflicted by the New Zealand gunners. At least nine PVA battalions were believed to have been involved in the attacks. The fighting between 24‚Äì26 July had cost the Australians five killed and 24 wounded, while during the previous two weeks on The Hook 2 RAR had lost a total of 17 men killed and 31 wounded. It had been a bitter struggle to the very end and as a testimony to the ferocity of the fighting, the Royal Australian Regiment was subsequently granted the battle honour \\"The Samichon\\". Many Australians were later awarded bravery decorations for their actions. The New Zealand gunners had played a crucial role in stemming the PVA assault and during these final actions the commander of 163 Battery, 16 RNZA‚ÄîMajor James Spence‚Äîhad positioned himself well-forward in order to effectively co-ordinate the indirect fires of his guns. Spence was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, while a member of his tactical party, Gunner Arthur Bolton, was later Mentioned in Despatches. In total over the three nights more than 23,000 rounds were fired by the Commonwealth Divisional Artillery. alt=Aerial photograph in black and white of a spur line running diagonally from the top of the photograph to the bottom right, pockmarked and devoid of vegetation. The low ground surrounding feature in the bottom left is heavily cratered, many of which appear to be filled with water. During the final month of the war heavy fighting had occurred across the central and eastern fronts. Yet in the Commonwealth sector itself the only PVA attacks had been made against 2 RAR holding The Hook on the nights of 24‚Äì25 and 25‚Äì26 July. The action was part of a larger attack against the 1st Marine Division, with only diversionary assaults mounted against the Australians. 1st Commonwealth Division intelligence staff believed that the PVA had been attempting to make a breakthrough to the Imjin River along the divisional boundary in order to turn the 1st Marine Division's flank, yet with well-coordinated indirect fires from the divisional artillery and support from the British tanks, 2 RAR had been able to successfully thwart both assaults. Meanwhile, the Marines had endured the brunt of a division-size attack, repelling the PVA onslaught for the loss of 43 killed and 316 wounded over the two nights; total Marine casualties for July included 181 killed and 1,430 wounded. Indeed, with the Chinese determined to gain local territorial advantage prior to signing the ceasefire, the UN Command had suffered 65,000 casualties during the final three months of the war, while the PVA lost at least 135,000. Subsequent operations On 26 July Wilton had ordered Lieutenant Colonel Peter Jeffreys to prepare a counter-attack by 1 DLI to recover some of the ground lost to the PVA the night before, but after preparatory fire failed to clear the PVA from the objective the assault was cancelled. The PVA subsequently made another attempt against the Marines on Hill 119 on the night of 26/27 July, but it lacked the weight of those of the previous nights and was easily repelled. In a final attempt to capture Boulder City at 21:30 a PVA platoon had advanced on the wire at Hill 119, defended by Company E, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. Just after midnight another platoon- sized PVA assault was also halted by the Marines. At 00:45 a PVA platoon probed the Marines on Hill 111, yet after an hour and twenty minutes it was also checked. Meanwhile, despite the clashes nearby on Hill 111 the Australians suffered no more casualties. The Armistice Agreement was subsequently signed at 10:00 on 27 July with a ceasefire coming into effect at 22:00. Sporadic fighting continued, and the New Zealand gunners fired several counter-battery tasks, engaging several PVA guns. The Commonwealth Divisional Artillery fired 1,300 rounds during the day; by evening the front was largely silent. In the last four hours of the war the PVA fired 44,000 artillery rounds into the US Eighth Army positions, although none against the 1st Commonwealth Division. There were no further attacks and the ceasefire came into effect at 22:00. The following day some soldiers from both sides moved forward into no-man's land to exchange greetings, although relatively few Australians did so and the Marines were under orders not to fraternise or communicate with the Chinese. alt=Six evenly spaced Caucasian soldiers wearing slouch hats with their rifles slung march along a dirt road in a straight line from right to left, carrying packs.

With the war over both sides were required to withdraw within 72 hours to create the Korean Demilitarised Zone, and preparations began to hastily evacuate the forward positions. During August and September sappers from the 1st Commonwealth Division were subsequently engaged clearing minefields and demolishing many of their former defended localities and field defences, while new battle positions were established to the rear. A similar process occurred across the entire front. Meanwhile, under the terms of the agreement all prisoners who wished to be repatriated were to be returned, and 12,773 UN and 75,000 Chinese and North Korean prisoners were subsequently exchanged during this period, including 21 Australians and one New Zealander. The period that followed proved uneventful, yet the UN forces were required to maintain combat readiness and the ability to react quickly in case the North Koreans violated the ceasefire. In April 1954, 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956. 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea and five years before that in Japan. British Commonwealth forces remained in Korea until they were finally withdrawn in August 1957. Meanwhile, the last PVA elements did not leave Korea until 1958.

Fred Lorenzen, driving a 1965 Ford, won the race from fourth position in a two- hour-and-23-minute time span by Darel Dieringer by a full lap. There were 3 cautions flags which slowed the race for 43 laps. The race ended on lap 133 due to persistent rain. This was Lorenzen's first victory of the season. Safety innovations NASCAR instituted new rules in October 1964 to enhance safety and decrease speeds for 1965 after the previous year's deaths of Joe Weatherly and Fireball Roberts. The Chrysler Hemi engine was dominated that year by 1964 NASCAR Champion Richard Petty. Ford Motor Company wanted a new engine with high-rise cylinder heads to compete with the Hemi and threatened to pull out if Bill France Sr. didn't allow it. NASCAR's new rules, however, banned both Hemi engines and high-rise cylinder heads. Speedweeks Darel Dieringer won the pole with a speed of 171.151 mph in Bud Moore's 1964 Mercury, then held off Ned Jarrett's move in the final turn to win the first 100-mile qualifying race. the second race became a duel between Fred Lorenzen and Junior Johnson. Lorenzen took the lead on lap 39. But when he roared under the white flag, he mistook it for the checkered flag. Lorenzen let off and Johnson passed him on the last lap to win. The second qualifying race featured a wild first lap crash as Ron Eulenfeld triggered a wild crash that also took out 12 other cars in the race. Eulenfeld walked away from that crash. Race Day On Race day, Junior Johnson grabbed the lead on the first lap from his second starting spot and led the first 27 laps. at that car 14 cars were out all because of mechanical problems. Johnson was racing in his usual go-for- broke style when a tire blew. Johnson's car hurled into the outside wall and spread debris over a wide area. Johnson suffered only a cut over his eye. After Johnson's abrupt departure, 1961 winner Marvin Panch led through lap 68 in the Wood Brothers Ford, with Lorenzen and Bobby Johns on his tail. Lorenzen led laps 69 through 78 before giving way to panch. At halfway, Panch was still in control, but clouds were darkening over the track. On lap 119, Lorenzen edged past panch and took the lead for only the second time. Rain was falling by Lap 129. As the yellow light came on, Panch made a run on Lorenzen coming off turn two. Panch went to the outside, Lorenzen moved up, the cars touched and Panch spun down the backstretch, ending his chances for a second 500 victory. Lorenzen remained in the lead, but the fender that had hit Panch's car was bent in on his tire. \\"Stay out\\" ordered crew chief Herb Nab, who was counting on the weather to shorten the race.

It is also sometimes used to differentiate adherents to the Latin Church and its Roman rite from other Catholics, i.e. adherents of the Eastern Catholic Churches of various Eastern rites. It is not the official name preferred by the Holy See or bishops in full communion with the Pope as a designation for their faith or institution. \\"Catholic\\" is one of the Four Marks of the Church set out in the Nicene Creed, a statement of belief widely accepted across Christian denominations. Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox consider the term to refer to a single institutional one true church, while Protestant ecclesiology considers it to refer to a church invisible referred to as the Christian Church. Following the pejorative term \\"papist\\", attested in English since 1534, the terms \\"Popish Catholic\\" and \\"Romish Catholic\\" came into use during the Protestant Reformation. From the 17th century, \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" has been used as a synonym for the Catholic Church by some Anglicans and other Protestants in English-speaking countries.\\"Everyone claimed to be 'catholic' and 'evangelical' and (eventually) 'reformed', but now each of these became a denominational label. The name 'Roman Catholic' conjoined the universality of the church 'over the entire world' with the specificity of 'only one single see'\\" () Jaroslav Pelikan, 1985, The Christian Tradition: Volume 4, Reformation of Church and Dogma (1300‚Äì1700) (Section on The Roman Catholic Particularity). University of Chicago Press pages 245‚Äì246 Formulations such as the \\"Holy Roman Church\\" or the \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" have occurred by officials of the Catholic Church before and after the Reformation. While it typically refers to the Diocese of Rome, such as in Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, it has also occurred in the context of ecumenical dialogue with dialogue partners preferring this usage. The first known occurrence of \\"Roman Catholic\\" as a synonym for \\"Catholic Church\\" was in communication with the Armenian Apostolic Church in 1208, after the East‚ÄìWest Schism. However, the last official magisterium document to use \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" was issued by Pope Pius XII in 1950. The use of \\"Catholic Church\\" is officially used by the Holy See. It is applied in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1990), the Code of Canon Law (1983), in the documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), the First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì1870) and the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), and numerous other official documents.The Vatican. Documents of the II Vatican Council . Retrieved 4 May 2009. Note: The pope's signature appears in the Latin version. \\"Catholic Church\\" and \\"Catholic(s)\\" is also broadly reflected in most English-language academia and media. History of the term 16th and 17th centuries Thomas Taylor; the National Gallery, London The terms \\"Romish Catholic\\" and \\"Roman Catholic\\", along with \\"Popish Catholic\\", were brought into use in the English language chiefly by adherents of the Church of England.\\"Roman Catholic\\" at Catholic Encyclopedia online. The reign of Elizabeth I of England at the end of the 16th century was marked by conflicts in Ireland. Those opposed to English rule forged alliances with those against the Protestant Reformation, making the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" almost synonymous with being Irish during that period, although that usage changed significantly over time.Charles Hefling, 2006 The Oxford Guide to the Book of Common Prayer Oxford University Press p. 202. Like the term \\"Anglican\\", the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" came into widespread use in the English language only in the 17th century.A.C. Hamilton, 1997 The Spenser Encyclopedia, University of Toronto Press, , p. 160. The terms \\"Romish Catholic\\" and \\"Roman Catholic\\" were both used in the 17th century and \\"Roman Catholic\\" was used in some official documents, such as those relating to the Spanish Match in the 1620s. There was, however, significant tension between Anglicans and Roman Catholics at the time (as reflected in the Test Act for public office). Even today, the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibits Roman Catholics from becoming English monarchs. 18th and 19th centuries Saint Mary's Roman Catholic Mission, built in 1866 in Stevensville, Montana The official and popular uses of the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" in the English language grew in the 18th century. Up to the reign of George III, Catholics in Britain who recognized the Pope as head of the Church had generally been designated in official documents as \\"Papists\\". In 1792, however, this phraseology was changed and, in the Speech from the Throne, the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" was used.William Lecky 2001, A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century, Adamant Media , p. 134. By the early 19th century, the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" had become well established in the English-speaking world. As the movement that led to Catholic Emancipation through the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829 grew, many Anglicans and Protestants generally began to accept that being a Roman Catholic was not synonymous with being disloyal to the British Crown. While believing that in the past the term Roman Catholic may have been synonymous with rebel, they held that it was by then as indicative of loyalty as membership in any other Christian denomination.The Critical Review, Series III, Volume XI (May 1807), published by Pickering & Chatto, London, p. 104. The situation had been very different two centuries before, when Pope Paul V forbade English members of his church from taking an oath of allegiance to King James I, a prohibition that not all of them observed.Lisa McClain, Lest we be damned: practical innovation and lived experience among Catholics in Protestant England (2003, ), pp. 257-268. Also in the 19th century, some prominent Anglican theologians, such as William Palmer and John Keble, supported the Branch Theory, which viewed the universal Church as having three principal branches: Anglican, Roman and Eastern.Paul Avis, Anglicanism and the Christian Church (T. & T. Clark Publishers, 2002, ) p. 221. The 1824 issue of The Christian Observer defined the term Roman Catholic as a member of the \\"Roman Branch of the Church\\".The Christian Observer, Volume 23, 1824, p. 133. By 1828, speeches in the British Parliament routinely used the term Roman Catholic and referred to the \\"Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church\\".Robert Inglis, 1828, On the Roman Catholic question, published by J. Hatchard, Piccadilly, London, 1828. In the United States, use of the term \\"Roman Catholic\\", as well as the number of Catholics, began to grow only in the early 19th century. In 1790 there were only 100 Catholics in New York and some 30,000 in the whole country, with only 29 priests.John Fletcher Hurst, Short History of the Church in the United States, A.D. 1492‚Äì1890, published by Bibliolife, 2008, , page 82 As the number of Catholics in the United States grew rapidly from 150,000 to 1.7 million between 1815 and 1850, mostly by way of immigration from Ireland and the German Confederation, many clergy followed to serve that population, and Roman Catholic parishes were established.Erwin Fahlbusch, The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4, Eardsman Publishing, 2005, , page 626 The terms \\"Roman Catholic\\" and \\"Holy Roman Catholic\\" thus gained widespread use in the United States in the 19th century, both in popular usage and in official documents.The United States Catholic magazine and monthly review, 1847, page 564Jos√© Baralt, 1999, The policy of the United States towards its territories, University of Puerto Rico Press, , page 119James Hitchcock, The Supreme Court and Religion in American Life Princeton Univ Press, 2004, , page 165 In 1866, US President Andrew Johnson attended a meeting of the Council of the Roman Catholic Church.James J. Hennesey, American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States, Oxford University Press, 1983, , p. 159. Branch theory The branch theory was popularized during the Anglican Oxford Movement, of which John Henry Newman was a member. Newman later dropped that conviction and converted to the Catholic Church. There is sometimes controversy about the name \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" when it is used by members of other churches to suggest that the church in full communion with Rome is only one part of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. That argument is linked especially with the branch theory upheld by many Anglicans that the church in communion with the Pope is only one branch of a divided Catholic Church, of which the Eastern Orthodox Church and Anglicanism are the other two principal branches. In 1864, the Holy Office rejected the branch theory and affirmed in a letter written to the English bishops that the Roman Church is not just a part of the Catholic Church and stating that \\"there is no other Catholic Church except that which is built on the one man, Peter\\". In 1870, English bishops attending the First Vatican Council raised objections to the expression Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia (\\"Holy Roman Catholic Church\\"), which appeared in the schema (the draft) of the council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith. The bishops proposed for the word \\"Roman\\" to be omitted or at least for commas to be inserted between the adjectives out of concern that use of the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" would lend support to proponents of the branch theory. While the council overwhelmingly rejected that proposal, the text was finally modified to read \\"Sancta Catholica Apostolica Romana Ecclesia\\"The acts of the council published in Acta Sanctae Sedis, volume V (1869‚Äì1870), p. 484 translated into English either as \\"the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church\\"English translation by Henry Edward Manning in Philip Schaff, Creeds of Christendom: Volume II. The History of Creeds or, by separating each adjective, as \\"the holy, catholic, apostolic and Roman Church\\". From 1937 to 1972, the Constitution of Ireland recognised the \\"special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church\\". The Anglican Archbishop of Dublin had objected to \\"Catholic Church\\" and quoted the Council of Trent for the longer title, which was approved by Eugenio Pacelli and Pope Pius XI. The same name is used in a 2009 Irish law.Charities Act 2009 ¬ß99(3) Irish Statute Book 20th century American Catholics, who by the year 1900 were 12 million people and had a predominantly Irish clergy,William D'Antonio, 2001 American Catholics AltaMira Press page 1 objected to what they considered the reproachful terms Popish and Romish and preferred the term Roman Catholic.Israel Rupp, 1861 Religious denominations in the United States of America, Desilver Publishers, Philadelphia, p. 137. In the early 20th century, the use of \\"Roman Catholic\\" continued to spread in the United States and Canada to refer to individuals, parishes, and their schools. For instance, the 1915 Report of the Commissioner of Education of the United States had a specific section for \\"Roman Catholic Parish Schools\\".Report of the Commissioner of Education United States Office of Education, 1915, page 560 By 1918, legal proceedings in state supreme courts (from Delaware to Minnesota) and laws passed in the State of New York used the term \\"Roman Catholic parish\\".Atlantic Reporter, Volume 98, 1917, West Publishing Co.

Mass being celebrated at the Vietnamese American \\"Roman Catholic Festival\\", Marian Days, 2007 \\"Roman Catholic\\" is generally used on its own to refer to individuals, and in compound forms to refer to worship, parishes, festivals, etc. Its usage has varied, depending on circumstances.Earle E. Cairns, 1996 Christianity through the centuries Zondervan Press p. 452. It is sometimes also identified with one or other of the terms \\"Catholic\\", \\"Western Catholic\\" (equivalent to \\"Latin Catholic\\"), and \\"Roman-Rite Catholic\\". Saint Ignatius of Antioch first used the term \\"Catholic Church\\" (literally meaning universal church) in his Letter to the Smyrnaeans around 107 AD.John Meyendorff, Catholicity and the Church, St Vladimirs Seminary Press, 1997, , page 7 The terms \\"Catholic Church\\" and \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" are names for the entire church that describes itself as \\"governed by the successor of Saint Peter and by the bishops in communion with him.\\" In its formal documents and pronouncements the church most often refers to itself as the \\"Catholic Church\\" or simply \\"the Church\\" (written in documents with a capital \\"C\\"). In its relations with other churches, it frequently uses the name \\"Roman Catholic Church\\", which it also uses internally, though less frequently. Some writers, such as Kenneth Whitehead and Patrick Madrid, argue that the only proper name for the church is \\"the Catholic Church\\".McClintock, p. 71, quote: \\"The name [Roman Catholic Church] may be found in a number of Roman Catholic writers, and is generally used in the constitution of those states in which the Roman Catholic Church is recognized as one of the recognized or tolerated State churches. It is, however, not the official name used by the authorities of the Church who rather dislike it, and substitute for it the name 'Catholic' or 'Holy Catholic' Church. The name 'Roman Church' is applied, in the language of the Church, to the Church or diocese of the Bishop of Rome.\\" Whitehead, for example, states that \\"The term Roman Catholic is not used by the Church herself; it is a relatively modern term, and one, moreover, that is confined largely to the English language. The English-speaking bishops at the First Vatican Council in 1870, in fact, conducted a vigorous and successful campaign to insure that the term Roman Catholic was nowhere included in any of the Council's official documents about the Church herself, and the term was not included.\\" The name \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" is occasionally used by popes, bishops, other clergy and laity, who do not see it as opprobrious or having the suggested overtone.References are given below to many cases in which authorities within the Church, from the Pope down, do use it in this way The use of \\"Roman\\", \\"Holy\\", and \\"Apostolic\\" are accepted by the Church as descriptive names. At the time of the 16th-century Reformation, the Church itself \\"claimed the word catholic as its title over Protestant or Reformed churches\\".John E. Booty, Academic American Encyclopedia, (1995) p 211, Volume 4 published by Grolier, Inc. It believes that it is the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. Throughout the years, in various instances, official church documents have used both the terms \\"Catholic Church\\" and \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" to refer to the worldwide church as a whole, including Eastern Catholics, as when Pope Pius XII taught in Humani generis that \\"the Mystical Body of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church are one and the same thing.\\"Encyclical Humani generis, 27 However, some Eastern Christians, though in communion with the Bishop of Rome, apply the adjective \\"Roman\\" to the Latin or Western Church alone. Representatives of the Catholic Church are at times required to use the term \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" in certain dialogues, especially in the ecumenical milieu, since some other Christians consider their own churches to also be authentically Catholic.Bud Heckman, Interactive Faith: The Essential Interreligious Community-Building Handbook, Skylight Path Press, 2008, , p. 235. In the 21st century, the three terms ‚Äì \\"Catholic Church\\", \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" and \\"Holy Roman Catholic Church\\" ‚Äì continue to appear in various books and other publications. Scholarly debate on the proper form of reference to the Catholic Church within specific contexts continues. For instance, the Catechism of the Catholic Church does not contain the term \\"Roman Catholic Church\\", referring to the church only by names such as \\"Catholic Church\\" (as in its title),The Catechism of the Catholic Church was issued by Pope John Paul II in 1992 on the basis of a French text (the English translation appeared only in 1994). The official Latin text, with a few revisions, appeared in 1997, and later editions in English and other languages are based on that text. The definitive English translation is available on the Holy See's website and has been printed under the auspices of various episcopal conferences. while the Advanced Catechism Of Catholic Faith And Practice states that the term Roman is used within the name of the church to emphasize that the center of unity is the Roman See.Thoms O'Brian, An Advanced Catechism Of Catholic Faith And Practice, Kessinger Publishers, 2005, , page 70 \\"Roman Catholic\\" and \\"Catholic\\" \\"In popular usage, 'Catholic' usually means 'Roman Catholic',\\" a usage opposed by some, including some Protestants.James Hastings Nichols, Primer for Protestants (Kessinger Publishing Company 2004 ), p. 9 \\"Catholic\\" usually refers to members of any of the 24 constituent Churches, the one Western and the 23 Eastern. The same meaning is attributed also to \\"Roman Catholic\\" in older documents of the Holy See, talks by Popes and in newspapers. Although K. D. Whitehead has claimed that \\"the term Roman Catholic is not used by the Church herself\\" and that \\"the proper name of the Church, then, is 'the Catholic Church', never 'the Christian Church',\\" Kenneth D. Whitehead, One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic: The Early Church was Catholic Church (Ignatius Press 2000 ), Appendix I, which also misnames the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church as the \\"Oxford Book of the Christian Church\\" and treats as synonymous the terms \\"Roman Rite\\" (a liturgical rite) and \\"Latin Rite\\" (a particular Church). official documents such as Divini Illius Magistri, Humani generis, a declaration of 23 November 2006 and another of 30 November 2006, while not calling the Church \\"the Christian Church\\", do use \\"Roman Catholic\\" to speak of it as a whole without distinguishing one part from the rest. But ecclesiologists normally seen to be as diverse as Joseph Ratzinger and Walter Kasper agree that one should never use the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" to denote the entire Catholic Church. When used in a broader sense, the term \\"Catholic\\" is distinguished from \\"Roman Catholic\\", which has connotations of allegiance to the Bishop of Rome, i.e. the Pope. When thus used, \\"Catholic\\" also refers to many other Christians, especially Eastern Orthodox and Anglicans, but also to others, including Old Catholics and members of various Independent Catholic denominations, who consider themselves to be within the \\"catholic\\" tradition.Thomas P. Rausch, Catherine E. Clifford, Catholicism in the Third Millennium (Glazier, Michael, Incorporated 2003 ), p. 248. See also the List of Christian denominations#Catholicism, in which the \\"Catholicism\\" section includes the Assyrian Church of the East, the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and other churches which call themselves Catholic. They describe themselves as \\"Catholic\\", but not \\"Roman Catholic\\" and not under the authority of the Pope. Similarly, Henry Mills Alden writes: According to this viewpoint, \\"For those who 'belong to the Church,' the term Methodist Catholic, or Presbyterian Catholic, or Baptist Catholic, is as proper as the term Roman Catholic. It simply means that body of Christian believers over the world who agree in their religious views, and accept the same ecclesiastical forms.\\" \\"Roman Catholic\\" and \\"Western\\" or \\"Latin Catholic\\" The Holy See has at times applied the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" to refer to the entirety of the church that is in full communion with it, encompassing both its Eastern and Western elements. For examples of statements by Popes that employ the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" in this way, see Papal references below. This is the only meaning given to the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" at that official level. However, some do use the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" to refer to Western (i.e. Latin) Catholics, excluding Eastern Catholics. An example is the statement in the book When other Christians become Catholic: \\"the individual becomes Eastern Catholic, not Roman Catholic\\".Paul Turner, 2007, When other Christians become Catholic. Liturgical Press. , p. 141. Similarly the Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth states that \\"not all Catholics are Roman Catholics and there are other Catholic Churches\\", using the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" to refer to Western Church members alone.Brian Singer-Towns, 2003, The Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth. Saint Mary's Press. , p. 105. The same distinction is made by some writers belonging to Eastern Catholic churches. That this view is not the only one, not alone at the level of the Holy See and in reference books such as John Hardon's Modern Catholic Dictionary,http://www.catholicreference.net/index.cfm?id=36128 but also at a popular level, is shown by the use of terms such as \\"Byzantine Roman Catholic\\" and \\"Maronite Roman Catholic\\" as self-identification by individuals or as the name of a church building.See examples given below in the discussion of names of parish churches. Additionally, in other languages, the usage varies significantly.E.g. Arabic-speaking Melkite Catholics, who use the Byzantine liturgical rite, occasionally identify themselves as Rum Katolique with reference to the \\"New Rome\\" of Constantinople, home of their Byzantine-rite heritage (Faulk, p. 7). On the other hand, the Maronites, who are also Arabic- speaking but not of Byzantine Rite, call themselves Roman Catholics with reference to the Rome of the Popes.\\"Surrounded by Mussulmans, schismatics, and heretics, they are proud to call themselves Roman Catholics\\" Many, even Catholics, are unaware or only dimly aware that the Catholic Church has Western and Eastern branches. This is partly because, outside the Middle East, Africa, and India, Eastern Catholics are a small fraction of the total number of Catholics.Joseph A. Varacalli, 2005 The Catholic experience in America Greenwood Press pages 125 The last known magisterial use of \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" was Pope Pius XII in Humani generis who taught that \\"the Mystical Body of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church are one and the same thing\\".Encyclical Humani generis, 27. The Second Vatican Council would take a more nuanced view of this issue (Lumen gentium, 7-8). Further, Adrian Fortescue noted in his article in the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia the distinction between \\"Roman Church\\" and \\"Church of Rome\\". He said that the expression \\"Church of Rome\\" commonly applied by non-Catholics to the Catholic Church but, according to him, it can only be used correctly to refer the Diocese of Rome; and the term \\"Roman Church\\", in case of the patriarchate, can be used as equivalent to \\"Latin Church\\": \\"A German Catholic is not, strictly speaking, a member of the Church of Rome but of the Church of Cologne, or Munich-Freising, or whatever it may be, in union with and under the obedience of the Roman Church (although, no doubt, by a further extension Roman Church may be used as equivalent to Latin Church for the patriarchate).\\"Adrian Fortescue, \\"Latin Church\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia, (New York 1910) \\"Roman Catholic\\" and \\"Roman Rite Catholic\\" Celebration of Solemn Mass When referring to worship, the term Roman Catholic is at times used to refer to the \\"Roman Rite\\", which is not a church but a form of liturgy. The Roman Rite is distinct from the liturgies of the Eastern Catholic Churches and also from other Western liturgical rites such as the Ambrosian Rite, which have a much smaller following than the Roman Rite. An example of this usage is provided in the book Roman Catholic Worship: Trent to today states:James White 2003, Roman Catholic Worship: Trent to Today, Liturgical Press, page xv > We use the term Roman Catholic Worship throughout to make it clear that we > are not covering all forms of Catholic worship. There are a number of > Eastern Rite churches that can justly claim the title Catholic, but many of > the statements we make do not apply to them at all. Compared to the Roman Rite, the other Western liturgical rites have little following. Hence, the Vatican department that deals with forms of worship (including music) in the Western Church often issues documents that deal only with the Roman Rite.E.g. see Musicam Sacram and Redemptionis Sacramentum Jan Michael Joncas, 1997 From Sacred Song to Ritual Music: Twentieth-Century Understandings of Roman Catholic Worship Music Liturgical Press page 6Donald Boccardi, 2001 The history of American Catholic hymnals: since Vatican II GIA Press page 115 Any involvement by the Holy See in questions of Eastern liturgies is handled by a different department. Some of the writers who draw a contrast between \\"Roman Catholics\\" and \\"Eastern Catholics\\" may perhaps be distinguishing Eastern Catholics not from Latin or Western Catholics in general, but only from those (the majority of Latin Catholics) who use the Roman liturgical rite. Adrian Fortescue explicitly made this distinction, saying that, just as \\"Armenian Catholic\\" is used to mean a Catholic who uses the Armenian rite, \\"Roman Catholic\\" could be used to mean a Catholic who uses the Roman Rite. In this sense, he said, an Ambrosian Catholic, though a member of the Latin or Western Church, is not a \\"Roman\\" Catholic. He admitted, however, that this usage is uncommon.Adrian Fortescue, 2001 The Uniate Eastern Churches Gorgias Press page 3 Parishes and dioceses St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Perryopolis, Pennsylvania When the term \\"Roman Catholic\\" is used as part of the name of a parish it usually indicates that it is a Western parish that follows the Roman Rite in its liturgy, rather than, for instance, the less common Ambrosian Rite, e.g. St. Dominic Roman Catholic Church, Oyster Bay, New York. The shorter term \\"Catholic\\" may also appear in parish names and \\"Roman Catholic\\" sometimes even appears in the compound name of Eastern Catholic parishes, e.g. St. Anthony Maronite Roman Catholic Church.Examples are St. Anthony Maronite Roman Catholic Church, Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Roman Catholic Church All Catholic parishes are part of an ecclesiastical jurisdiction, usually a diocese (called an eparchy in the canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches).For areas that are not part of a diocese or eparchy, the Church usually establishes another form of jurisdiction, e.g., apostolic vicariate, exarchate (for Eastern Catholic Churches), apostolic prefecture, territorial prelature, or mission sui juris. In special cases, the Holy See establishes an apostolic administration, as was the case when the Church began to re-establish itself in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. There are also military ordinariates with \\"parishes\\" on military bases. For further information, see Catholic Church hierarchy#Equivalents of diocesan bishops in law. See also List of Roman Catholic dioceses (alphabetical). These jurisdictions are usually grouped in ecclesiastical provinces, headed by a metropolitan archdiocese.Some dioceses are not part of an ecclesiastical province. See List of Roman Catholic dioceses (structured view)#Dioceses that are immediately subject to the Holy See. All dioceses and similar jurisdictions‚ÄîEastern and Western‚Äîcome under the authority of the Pope.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 43 and 45; Code of Canon Law, canons 331 and 333 The term \\"Roman Catholic archdiocese\\" is formally used to refer to both Western and Eastern Churches. As of January 2009, there were 630 Roman Catholic archdioceses, Western and Eastern.See List of Roman Catholic archdioceses. Second Vatican Council The Second Vatican Council did not use the term \\"Roman Catholic Church\\", and in one important passage of the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium replaced it with an equivalent phrase, \\"the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in union with that successor,\\" while also giving in a footnote a reference to two earlier documents in which the word \\"Roman\\" was used explicitly.Avery Dulles, The Catholicity of the Church, Oxford University Press, 1987, , page 132 But as the prominent theologian at the Council Karl Rahner pointed out, by the 1960s the Church had made its second major transition. The first had been from Jewish to Western-Gentile. And now this Western church had become a world church. With Vatican II's decision to allow the liturgy in the vernacular, not everything would be so \\"Roman\\" anymore., 36,63,101. Retrieved 12 May 2017. The word \\"Roman\\" would be used mainly to designate the liturgy in Latin with its Roman origins. And by fifty years after Vatican II, with only one third of the Catholic church's 1.2 billion members living in the Western world, the large contingent of the hierarchy from the non-Western world was making it truly a world church. The two earlier documents that the council stated had applied the phrase \\"Roman Church\\" to the Church itself, the church \\"governed by the successor of Saint Peter and by the bishops in communion with him,\\" were the Tridentine Profession of Faith and the First Vatican Council's dogmatic constitution on faith. As far back as 1208 the adjective \\"Roman\\" was applied to the Church \\"outside which we believe that no one is saved.\\"Denzinger 423 Considerable change in this doctrine on salvation is reflected by 1965 in the conciliar Declaration on Religious Freedom of the Second Vatican Council. In cases of dialogue with the churches and ecclesial communities of the west, however, who are in dialogue specifically with the Latin Church from which they derive, the term Roman Catholic is ambiguous whether it refers to the Latin Church specifically, or the entire Catholic communion, as in the dialogue with Archbishop of Canterbury Donald Coggan on 29 April 1977, Other examples include occasional, minor addresses or lectures, usually written by minor curial staff. Pope John Paul II referred to himself as \\"the Head of the Roman Catholic Church\\" (29 September 1979).http://www.catholiccommunications.ie/popejohnpaul-1stanniversary/popeirelandtexts.pdf He called the Church \\"Roman Catholic\\" when speaking to the Jewish community in Mainz on 17 November 1980, in a message to those celebrating the 450th anniversary of the Confessio Augustana on 25 June 1980, when speaking to the people of Mechelen, Belgium on 18 May 1985, when talking to representatives of Christian confessions in Copenhagen, Denmark on 7 June 1989, when addressing a delegation from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople on 29 June 1989, at a meeting of the Ukrainian Synod in Rome on 24 March 1980, at a prayer meeting in the Orthodox cathedral of Bialystok, Poland on 5 June 1991, when speaking to the Polish Ecumenical Council in Holy Trinity Church, Warsaw 9 June 1991, at an ecumenical meeting in the Aula Magna of the Col√©gio Catarinense, in Florian√≥polis, Brazil on 18 October 1991, and at the Angelus in S√£o Salvador da Bahia, Brazil on 20 October 1991. Pope Benedict XVI called the Church \\"the Roman Catholic Church\\" at a meeting in Warsaw on 25 May 2006 and in joint declarations that he signed with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams on 23 November 2006 and with Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople on 30 November 2006.http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/b16bart1decl.HTM These exceptions prove the rule, however. The total usage by popes of \\"Catholic Church\\" rather than \\"Roman Catholic\\" is a factor of 10:1, according to the Holy See's website, and there is zero usage as such in official documents of papal magisterium in the last 66 years. Catechism of the Catholic Church The Baltimore Catechism, the official catechism authorized by the Catholic bishops of the United States between 1885 and 1965, stated: \\"That is why we are called Roman Catholics; to show that we are united to the real successor of St. Peter\\" (Question 118), and refers to the Church as the \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" under Questions 114 and 131. There are efforts of conservative Catholics to keep alive teachings of this catechism that were not retained in the Post- Vatican II catechism published in 1992, like \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" that has not appeared in the Catechism of the Catholic Church since 1992. View of Eastern Catholics Some Eastern Catholics, while maintaining that they are in union with the Bishop of Rome, reject the description of themselves as being \\"Roman Catholics\\".\\"We are Non-Roman Catholics\\" ().\\"Roman or Melkite: What's the Difference\\" (). Others, however, do call themselves Roman Catholics\\"Surrounded by Mussulmans, schismatics, and heretics, they are proud to call themselves Roman Catholics\\" (Catholic Encyclopedia, article Maronites). and \\"Roman Catholic\\" sometimes appears in the compound name of Eastern Catholic parish churches, e.g. St. Anthony's Maronite Roman Catholic Church. Orthodox Christians sometimes use the term \\"Uniate\\" (occasionally spelled \\"Uniat\\") to describe the Eastern Catholic churches which were previously Eastern or Oriental Orthodox, although some consider this term derogatory. Official Catholic documents no longer use the term, due to its perceived negative overtones. In fact, according to John Erickson of Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, \\"The term 'uniate' itself, once used with pride in the Roman communion, had long since come to be considered as pejorative. 'Eastern Rite Catholic' also was no longer in vogue because it might suggest that the Catholics in question differed from Latins only in the externals of worship. The Second Vatican Council affirmed rather that Eastern Catholics constituted churches, whose vocation was to provide a bridge to the separated churches of the East.\\" Quoted in See also *Catholic Church  Notes  References Further reading Church statistics      * Arguably these [Eastern Catholic] Churches are Roman Catholic [...]; however, they are not referred to as such in common parlance [...] The Latin Church [...] is also correctly referred to as the Roman Catholic Church. * this relatively small community is now divided into three religious groups: Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Orthodox. * Note: Romanian, Greek, and Ukrainian statistics may be translations that reflect the usage of \\"Roman Catholic\\" in the original languages, and may not necessarily reflect the prevailing use of the term among native English speakers.

(December 1871 - 1931) was an English artist, member of the Birmingham Group, and leading illustrator of his day. Life and work New was born in Evesham Worcestershire, a cousin of Thomas New. He studied at the Birmingham Municipal School of Art under Edward R. Taylor (headmaster of the school) and A. J. Gaskin, becoming known in the 1890s as an illustrator in the black-and-white style of the Arts and Crafts movement. He specialised in pen and ink drawings of rural and urban landscapes, old buildings and their interiors, architectural features, and also designed bookplates. New provided illustrations for the English Illustrated Magazine and was commissioned by the Bodley Head publishing house (cofounded by John Lane) to work on critically acclaimed editions of books, such as The Compleat Angler by Izaak Walton and The Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White. In 1895, New was invited to meet William Morris at Kelmscott Manor, and went on to provide design work for the Kelmscott PressSee William Morris (Biog at the \\"website of Bob Speel\\") as well as illustrating Morris's two-volume biography by J. W. Mackail. Between 1896 and 1914, New provided hundreds of illustrations for over 50 books for various publishers (see booklist below). He also taught drawing to T E Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\").Geoffrey Syer. Morris was a Giant - the quest of T E Lawrence (Journal of the William Morris society, 10.4 (Spring 1994): 48-52. In 1905, New moved from Evesham, the place of his birth, to Oxford where he started work on a series of drawings of the University of Oxford colleges, a project which was to occupy him for the rest of his life and remained unfinished. The drawings were engraved by Emery Walker and sold as the \\"New Loggan Prints\\".\\"Loggan\\" was a reference to artist David Loggan (1635‚Äì1692) and his work \\"Oxonia illustrata\\". He also provided further illustrations for a series of books called the \\"College monographs\\" (see below). In 1921 New exhibited at the first exhibition of the Society of Graphic Art in London. New has been variously described as \\"deeply religious, scrupulous and patient in everything\\", \\"a life and a life's work of rare unity\\", \\"half artist and half saint\\", and \\"well read, especially in poetry and talked about art and literature with a sincerity that was very charming\\".See Jeremy Wilson's Lawrence of Arabia, the authorised biography, chapter 2 (1989).

History  In September 1893, four IHM Sisters (Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) opened a school called St. Patrick's, at Cathedral parish in Detroit. After several years as St. Patrick's Grade School, and Saints Peter and Paul Academy, the building was renamed Catholic Central High School for Girls and converted into a high school curriculum in the school year 1927-28. The first graduate was recorded on June 22, 1899. Thereafter, the school, under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Detroit, was administered by the IHM Sisters, Priests of the CICM order, and was accredited by the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation. The tuition-based academic program included strict entrance exams and admission requirements under which potential student applicants were carefully scrutinized. Many students traveled from considerable distances, not only from Detroit, Hamtramck and Highland Park but also suburbs including Ferndale, Grosse Pointe, and Livonia. Although the student body was predominantly white for many years, the social changes of the late 1950s and early 1960s began to bring about the enrollment of a small number of students of color. In an atmosphere of ethnic, cultural, and economic diversity, young women of all nationalities, some foreign-born from Eastern European countries, were assimilating comfortably and forming strong bonds of friendship. The interactions and developing camaraderie between the high-achieving students proved to be mutually beneficial and paved the way to academic success. Located on a quiet side-street in mid-town Detroit, the three-story school building's Gothic Revival structure is in keeping with the beautiful sounds wafting from nearby Orchestra Hall as the Detroit Symphony Orchestra rehearsed. Familiar symphonies and classical works by famous composers inadvertently provided accompaniment to afternoon classes.  Academics  The demanding college preparatory curriculum offered the required and elective courses at each grade level in Religion, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Foreign Language (Latin I, II, III), Business (Typing, Shorthand), and Physical Education. A low student-teacher ratio was maintained, ensuring a maximum student body of around 300. The faculty was strongly supported by families who shared the values and mission of Girls Catholic Central and the advantages of single-gender college preparatory education in the absence of demographic influences.  Religion  With the Patroness Mary Queen as inspiration, the principles of Christian life in the Roman Catholic tradition were stressed at all times. In addition to IHM Sisters faculty members, Diocesan priests of the CICM order also held regular religion classes. The academic program was accompanied by mandatory strict adherence to deeply religious values and devotion to the Catholic faith and Church rituals. Prior to the beginning of classes each morning, Mass was attended at the Chapel of St. Theresa-the Little Flower, which was adjacent to the school building, and the Sacrament of Confession was offered weekly.

Formerly a suburban village, Retkinia was incorporated into ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1946.Stƒôpniewski and Szambelan According to information provided by ≈Å√≥d≈∫ city council, the district has a population of around 60,000 people.Podzia≈Ç ≈õrodk√≥w z bud≈ºetu obywatelskiego miƒôdzy osiedla. The figure provided (37497+26767=64264) includes Karolew and Smulsko, so it is reasonable to assume the population of Retkinia proper to be around 60,000. Retkinia is one of 56 districts recognized by the Urban Information System in ≈Å√≥d≈∫,Map of Urban Information System areas in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ but in terms of municipal administration it is divided into Osiedle Karolew- Retkinia Wsch√≥d (Eastern Retkinia, including the district of Karolew) and Osiedle Retkinia Zach√≥d-Smulsko (Western Retkinia, including the district of Smulsko). The dominant type of housing in Retkinia is Panel√°k, built from the year 1972 on. Name The origin and meaning of the name Retkinia is uncertain. It has been suggested that the name originates from ret ki≈Ñ, an expression glossed as \\"cast the net.\\"Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 13. This could either refer to the act of throwing fishing nets (which would suggest that the area was rich in fish) or to casting away hunting nets and settling down, which would account for the origin of farming in the area. Neither \\"ret\\" nor \\"ki≈Ñ\\" are in use in contemporary Polish, and the etymology is a matter of guesswork.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska admit that \\"these are just our conjectures... and nothing more\\" (p. 13). Another theory suggests that the name of the district derives from the personal name Retko (or Retka). History The earliest archeological records in Retkinia date back to c. 800-250 B.C.E and are representative of Lusatian culture.SzlƒÖzak, p. 6. A major discovery in Retkinia was the excavation of a rich skeletal grave of a woman from the 3rd century C.E. in 1935.SzlƒÖzak, p. 6. 1398‚Äì1910 Before being incorporated into the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1946, Retkinia was for many centuries closely associated with the nearby town of Pabianice rather than the fledgling town of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. First mentioned in an ecclesiastical document in 1398, the village was administratively part of the Roman Catholic parish of St. Matthew in Pabianice from the late Middle Ages until 1910,Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 13. and together with Pabianice it belonged to the Cathedral Chapter of Krak√≥w until the Prussian invasion of 1793.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, pp. 11-22. After negotiations between the Chapter and the Prussian government following the second partition of Poland, the Chapter was compensated for the loss of lands, which became a property of the Prussian state,Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, pp. 22-23. later to be incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw (1807-1815) during the Napoleonic wars. After the Congress of Vienna, Retkinia, alongside ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Pabianice, became part of the newly created Congress Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire. In 1839 the State Treasury sold the forest in Retkinia to brothers Konstanty and Jan SiƒômiƒÖtkowski, and in 1841 the village was transferred into the ownership of Mateusz Lubowidzki, a member of the Council of State of the Kingdom of Poland.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, pp. 28-29. The latter sold the village to Wilhelm Nencki in 1854, whose family was compensated by the stateZa≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 29. following the abolition of serfdom in Congress Poland in 1864. Nencki tried to force the local peasants back into serfdom in 1864 but met with resistance and failed.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 62. In 1851 the eastern part of the village (later known as Zagrodniki) was struck by a devastating fire,SzlƒÖzak, p. 14. and in 1855 the area experienced a famine caused by protracted rains.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 57. Poor sanitation and poverty contributed to disease, including two outbreaks of cholera.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 59. The year 1875 saw a reparceling of land, which led to the creation of six areas of settlement (D≈Çuga Kolonia, Ma≈Ça Kolonia, Dzia≈Çy, Brz√≥zki, Piaski and Zagrodniki) that were to form the structure of Retkinia until the construction of the housing estate in the 1970s.SzlƒÖzak, pp. 14-15. According to official statistics from 1827, the village of Retkinia (then located in Kalisz Voivodeship, Sieradz obw√≥d, Szadek county) had 33 houses and a population of 300.Tabella, p. 137. By 1881, Retkinia had 50 houses and a population of 560.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 32. In 1902 the Warsaw-Kalisz railway line was opened, its tracks cutting the village in two. Folk culture Information about folk culture in Retkinia comes from a historical survey written by the local priest Pawe≈Ç Za≈Çuska and his brother Leonard. Writing in 1914, four years after the establishment of the local parish, they point to a high degree of superstition among the local population in the 19th century, possibly a result of the distance between the village of Retkinia and the parish church in Pabianice, which contributed to low levels of participation in religious services.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 72. Among local customs Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska mention throwing peas into the air at Christmas Eve dinner as a form of apotropaic magic directed against witchcraft, wrapping straw from the Christmas table around orchard trees to secure a good harvest, and dashing home from the church in carts to make the horses sweat, which was supposed to save them from sweating during labour in the fields.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, pp. 64-66. Local celebrations of Dyngus were particularly unrestrained, with incidents of young girls being thrown into troughs and poured with water sometimes leading to death of exposure.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, p. 66. The village had its own cunning man named Jan Chrzciciel Szer, a settler from Rheinland, who practised folk-medicine with the help of herbal remedies as well as charms and prayers.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, pp. 60-61. 1910‚Äì1946 A Catholic parish was established in Retkinia in 1910, and after three years of construction work (on 17 August 1913), the new church, built in the Neogothic style, was consecrated.SzlƒÖzak, p. 28. The village cemetery, surviving to this day, was also established in 1910. In 1914 Retkinia had a population of 1576, of which 63% were literate.Za≈Çuska and Za≈Çuska, pp.219-20 During World War I both the German and the Russian armies requisitioned food, horses, machinery and precious metals from the village.SzlƒÖzak, p. 17. In 1916 a hailstorm struck Retkinia, causing massive damage in the fields, and further worsening the difficult wartime economic situation of the population.SzlƒÖzak, p. 20. In the interwar period (1918-1939) the social structure of the village changed, accommodating many new craftsmen.SzlƒÖzak, p. 20. In 1934 Retkinia was electrified (though some households were electrified as late as in 1951).SzlƒÖzak, p. 39. World War II brought administrative change, as ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the surrounding area were incorporated in the Third Reich as Wartheland. On 1 January 1940 Retkinia was incorporated into the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ by the German administration under the name of Erzhausen.SzlƒÖzak, p. 20. The Polish population was evicted from their land in 1942-1943, and the total number of wartime casualties among the residents of Retkinia amounted to 144.SzlƒÖzak, pp. 20-21. The decision of the occupant regime to make Retkinia part of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was reversed after the end of World War II, but not for long, and in 1946 the Polish authorities reincorporated the village into the city.Dziennik Ustaw 1946 nr 4 poz. 35. 1946‚Äìpresent By 1956 Retkinia had a population of more than 5500,SzlƒÖzak, p. 77. retaining much of its rural character. A tram link to the city centre was established in 1955.≈Å√≥dzkie Tramwaje i Autobusy: Kalendarium. Tram no. 19 had its terminus by the fire station next to the church. The significance of the connection for the local community was commemorated by a monument erected in 2006, featuring tram wheels on a surviving section of the historical rails. The population reached 6000 by 1961.Odg≈Çosy 29/1961, p. 4. In the 1960s a decision was made to construct a large housing estate of concrete panel buildings in Retkinia. Construction work began in 1971.Ko≈Ço≈õ, p. 71. According to initial plans, it was to accommodate as many as 120,000 people, but the area south of the railway tracks was eventually designated for single-family houses that were to form a separate estate,Odg≈Çosy 29/1978, p. 6. bringing the total envisaged number of residents in Retkinia down to c. 70-80,000.Odg≈Çosy 44/1973, p. 6.Haase et al., p. 261. The estate was originally designed with an adequate number of green spaces, shops and other services, but public pressure and the demand for living quarters led to streamlining the construction effort to focus on blocks of flats only,Odg≈Çosy 21/1986, p. 4. resulting in a three- shift school system due to a shortage of school buildings coupled with a period of baby boom,Odg≈Çosy 51/1983, pp. 1, 7. and forcing many local residents to do their shopping in the city centre.Odg≈Çosy 21/1986, p. 4. The situation gradually improved in the 1980s.Odg≈Çosy 21/1986, p. 4. The quality of the blocks of flats also left much to be desired, with numerous complaints about flooded cellars and faulty heaters (which had to be replaced in more than 400 buildings) prompting the local authorities to undertake a massive program of repairs.Odg≈Çosy 21/1986, p. 4. Because of this situation the word ‚ÄòRetkinia‚Äô accreted negative associations and was sometimes used in the 1980s as a generic term for an unwelcoming and ugly block housing estate.Odg≈Çosy 7/1986, p. 7. (‚ÄòOlsztyn [...] obudowano takimi Retkiniami, ≈ºe a≈º ≈ºƒôby bolƒÖ‚Äô) High-pressure gas installation in Retkinia proved to be dangerous, and in 1982 there was a gas explosion that led to two deaths.Gronczewska 2016. In 1983 another gas explosion demolished one of the buildings, leading to 8 casualties.Sipowicz, Najbert and Pietras, pp. 121-22.Odg≈Çosy 51/1983, pp. 10-11. This led to a complete remodelling of the gas network in Retkinia.Odg≈Çosy 21/1986, p. 4. Following the construction of the housing district, the church, which by the late 1970s was too small for the growing congregation, was expanded. Construction work began in 1978 and continued well into the 1980s, although the main phase of construction finished by 1982.SzlƒÖzak, p. 79. The building lost its Neogothic elements, but elements of the old belfry are still recognizable within the new structure. Following the fall of communism in 1989, a number of new shopping centres, cafes and restaurants opened in Retkinia, and the district is now considered to be one of the most attractive places of residence in ≈Å√≥d≈∫.Szafra≈Ñska, p. 14. Transport Buses and trams Retkinia bus and tram terminus, located at the western end of the housing estate, serves as a major public transport hub for the south-western part of the city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Tram connections provide easy access to the city centre, and \\"[a] centrally laid tram line makes it one of the best served districts in the city for public transport.\\"Kronenberg and Bergier, p. 269. There are also direct bus connections to the Nowy J√≥zef√≥w industrial area, Port ≈Å√≥d≈∫ mall, as well as the nearby town of Konstantyn√≥w ≈Å√≥dzki. Another bus terminus (Kusoci≈Ñskiego) is located nearby, on the northwestern edge of the housing estate. Rail ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska railway station, one of the two main stations in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, is located only north-east of the housing estate‚Äôs eastern end and is served by a number of bus and tram routes that run between Retkinia and the city centre.

Air The city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ is served by ≈Å√≥d≈∫ W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont Airport, located about south of Retkinia. Despite the short distance, no direct tram or bus connections provide access to the airport from Retkinia, but route 65, which serves the airport, allows for an easy interchange with buses that reach the inner core of the district. Parks and recreation Rocky hillock in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Botanical Garden There are no municipal parks in Retkinia, but recreational green areas are to be found around the district, contiguous with its outer rim. * ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Botanical Garden is adjacent to Retkinia from the north-east. One of the largest botanical gardens in Poland, it has an area of 67 hectares. There are twelve artificial hillocks in the garden, covered with granite, limestone and sandstone blocks. The highest of these host an alpine garden, and the remainder can be found in the Japanese garden, arboretum and Polish flora section. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Zoo and Zdrowie Park (the largest in the city) are located on the far end of the Botanical Garden and together they comprise a vast green area serving the needs of not only Retkinia but the entire city.≈Å√≥d≈∫ Botanical Garden Home Page. * Las Lublinek, the city‚Äôs second largest municipal forest (with an area of 90,43 hectaresSpacery po zielonej ≈Åodzi: \\"Ziele≈Ñ w ≈Åodzi.\\"), is located south of Retkinia (on the south side of the Warsaw-Kalisz railway), and its woodland area and ponds attract many residents of the district. The area between the forest and Retkinia has been transformed into a woodland park in recent years, forming a continuous green area of more than 140 hectares,Gronczewska 2012. with a stretch of green land north of the railway also turned into a park, further extending the recreational area south of the district. * To the north-west of Retkinia, an open field and woodland area leads to the nearby district of Brus.

The piece was constructed in 1975. Its name refers not to apricots but to the surname of the French artist Francois Morellet, whose work Sph√®re-Trame inspired Popow.Romanowski. The sculpture is an example of geometrical abstract art. * Bociany (The Storks) is a sculpture by Micha≈Ç Ga≈Çkiewicz, professor at Strzemi≈Ñski Academy of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The piece presents five storks whose beaks face one another. The sculpture stands at the eastern end of the housing estate, at the point of entry to Retkinia from the city centre, and it is considered to be a symbol of the district. Ga≈Çkiewicz is also the author of another sculpture, Macierzy≈Ñstwo (Maternity), which presents a mother embracing her children.Kowalewska.Gronczewska 2017. * I believe in goats is a mural by the Chilean artist INTI, painted on one of the many blocks of flats in Retkinia.

Pasi refers tapping toddy, a traditional occupation of the Pasi community. The Pasi are divided into Gujjar, Kaithwas, and Boria. In the state of Andhra Pradesh,Telangana they have OBC status. They live in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Etymology The word Pashi, according to William Crooke, has been derived from the Sanskrit word Pashika, a noose used by Pasis to climb and tap toddy, a drink obtained from palm tree. The tapping of toddy is the original occupation of the Pasi community. However, just like other aspirational caste groups of India, Pasis have a myth of origin. They claim that they originate from the sweat of Parshuram, an incarnation of Vishnu. They claim support for this in the word sweat being derived from the Hindi word Pasina and it further paves the way for their claim of \\"Kshatriyatva\\". Population The Pasi live mainly in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, were their traditional occupation was that of rearing pigs. The Pasis of most of the north Indian states has been classified by the Government of India as Scheduled Caste (SC). As of the 2001 Census of India, the Pasi are the second-largest Dalit group in Uttar Pradesh, where they constituted 16 per cent of the Dalit population and were mostly recorded in the Awadh region. The 2011 Census of India for the state recorded their population as 6,522,166. That figure included the Tarmali.  History  Ramnarayan Rawat notes the role of the Pasi community (and other untouchable castes) in the Kisan Sabha Movement to have been understated by earlier historians, in that they documented a minimal and late-arriving Pasi involvement and additionally, one that was inclined to criminal behavior such as rioting, rather than political activism. From a reading of the archives, he notes that the involvement of Pasi and Chamars were significant from the outset and they being land-occupiers had the same concerns as of other savarna groups, rather than being the 'alienated' pig-rearers, hitherto assumed and portrayed. Chandra Bhan Prasad, a political commentator, has recalled about how those who continued pig-rearing were ill-treated by socio-political activists, who blamed the occupation in large part for their untouchable status rather than the Brahminism. The Pasi have in recent times engaged in invention of tradition. Badri Narayan, a social historian and cultural anthropologist, says that Of late, Hindu Nationalists (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and affiliates) have been trying to appropriate different folk-heroes of the Pasi caste, as Hindu icons to mobilize the electoral prospects of Bharatiya Janata Party. The Hindu nationalists have supported claims that there was a Pasi kingdom that ruled in what are now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during the 11th and 12th centuries. The rulers of this claimed state include Bijli Pasi.

It was released on August 18, 2009. The album debuted at #60 on the Billboard Top 200 selling roughly 8,000 copies in its first week. Felony is also the first album to feature new members Mike Mulholland on guitar and Mike Kaabe on drums, replacing founding members Ben and Joe Lionetti, respectively. Inspiration and musical style Inspiration The album is allegedly inspired by a real event in which vocalist Frankie Palmeri assaulted his best friend by \\"[hitting] him in the head with a bottle\\", which resulted in Palmeri being arrested. The lyrics for the album's title track also references this anecdote. Style Felony is the first album by Emmure to draw on more of a nu metal influence than their previous albums, evident of more frequent rapped vocals. The band, however, returned to more of their previous sound with the release of Speaker of the Dead, while still keeping elements of nu metal. AllMusic stated \\"...their streamlined brand of East Coast hardcore, death metal, and punk is as reliable as it is predictable.\\" Several songs on the album also reference several other popular culture media. Examples include the song title \\"I <3 EC2\\" (which is a reference to the film Planet Terror). The song \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" is the title to a fictional book from the film, Donnie Darko. The guitar riffs also sound similar to the melody of the song of the same title on the Donnie Darko score and the lyrics of the song also reference the movie heavily. The song \\"R2deepthroat\\" contains a verse of lyrics found in the 1995 hip hop song \\"Shook Ones (Part II)\\" by Mobb Deep, which was done as an homage to New York hip hop. The title of the second track, \\"I Thought You Met Telly and Turned Me Into Casper,\\" is a reference to two characters from the 1995 film Kids (film); Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and his friend Casper (Justin Pierce).

During his career he described 34 species of amphibians and reptiles.Author: Darevsky. The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org Darevskia, a genus of Caucasian rock lizards, is named after him. Early life and military career Darevsky was born on 18 December 1924 in Kiev. He was interested in amphibians and reptiles since his childhood, when he met Sergey A. Chernov, a herpetologist from Leningrad. During World War II, he was wounded twice and was decorated with the Order of the Red Star and Order of the Great Patriotic War of the 1st degree.Darevsky IS (2014) My Biography. Trudy Zoologicheskogo Instituta RAN. 318(4): 292‚Äì325. (in Russian, with an abstract in English). Scientific career After the war, Darevsky was recruited to join the Biology Faculty of the Moscow State University, from which he graduated in 1953. From 1954 to 1962, he worked in Armenia, first as a Ph. D. student, then as a Junior Researcher, Scientific Secretary and Head of the Department of Zoological Institute, Armenian SSR Academy of Sciences. In 1958, he defended his Kandidat thesis on reptiles of Armenia and their zoogeography (under the supervision of Dr. Sergey A. Chernov). Later on, studies of the Caucasian herpetofauna, and the rock lizards in particular, made him a recognized scientist. In 1962, Darevsky became Junior Researcher at the Zoological Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences; in 1967, he defended his Doktor of sciences thesis \\"The Rock Lizards of the Caucasus\\"; and in 1976, he became the Head of Laboratory of Ornithology and Herpetology, which he led for the next twenty years. Darevsky made many discoveries in evolutionary biology. He was the first to discover parthenogenesis and polyploidy in higher vertebrates and showed their importance for speciation. These discoveries inspired an explosion of similar investigations across many taxa and made Darevsky a world authority on the evolutionary importance of parthenogenesis and polyploidy in vertebrates. Darevsky authored more than three hundred scientific papers and several monographs about the systematics, ecology, paleontology, morphology, and conservation of amphibians and reptiles. He has also been part of many zoological expeditions to the Caucasus, Central Asia, Indonesia (Komodo), and Vietnam. He trained many scientists from the Commonwealth of Independent States, Mongolia, and Vietnam, and for many years he lectured on herpetology at Leningrad State University. For the training of next generation foreign scientists, he was awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples (1982) by the government of the Soviet Union and \\"Friendship\\" medal (2000) by the government of Vietnam. In 1985, he was given the honorary title of Honored Scientist of the RSFSR, and in 1987 he became a laureate of Mechnikov Prize. Darevsky was President of Russian Herpetological Society (1989‚Äì2006), honorary member of the Societas Europaea Herpetologia (since 1996) and American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (since 1973), and a member of many Russian and foreign scientific societies. Many species of amphibians and reptiles were named in honor of Darevsky. The Caucasian rock lizards, that Darevsky studied for his entire life, were named in his honor as a genus Darevskia, as well as the viper Vipera darevskii, and the lizard Eutropis darevskii.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Darevsky\\", p. 65). Being head of the Laboratory of Ornithology and Herpetology he brought a very democratic style of administration, that created a unique atmosphere of creative freedom. He was always friendly and eager in meeting young colleagues. Darevsky never refused anybody and always offered his assistance. During his last ten years, Darevsky was a leader of the St. Petersburg herpetological school. He became seriously ill over the last few years and was unable to visit the Zoological Institute. Nonetheless, he was continuously interested in the life of his colleagues and was upset that he could not work anymore. But as he said before his death: \\"I did a lot and now I should have some rest\\". He died on 8 August 2009 at age of 84. Selected publications *Orlov, Nikolai; Darevsky, Ilya S.

In 2009, nine members of Moses' extended family, all siblings of her mother or their spouses, were charged in relation to the event. One uncle and four aunts were subsequently found guilty of drowning Moses. The mƒÅkutu lifting and subsequent trial were notable for bringing makutu into the public consciousness in New Zealand; and the large number of independent people who stepped forward to distance mƒÅkutu lifting as they knew it from the events in this case. Unprecedented media attention was paid to mƒÅkutu, mƒÅkutu lifting and MƒÅori religion. MƒÅkutu MƒÅkutu is a MƒÅori language word which can be either a noun or a verb depending on context. It is translated into English by church missionaries as curse, witchcrafthttp://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BudAbor-t1-body-d1-d1-d7.html or sorcery.http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=makutu In modern orthography, mƒÅkutu is written with a macron where technically possible, but in historical sources and sometimes in modern sources (such as newspapers) with limited technical capabilities it is written without the macron. Historically, the tohunga involved in lifting mƒÅkutu were suppressed by the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907, which was repealed in 1962. MƒÅkutu and mƒÅkutu lifting In the period prior to the mƒÅkutu lifting, Janet Moses had suffered the loss of her grandmother and relationship problems with her partner and father of her two children; the trial would later hear expert testimony that she likely had an \\"underlying psychiatric or psychological disorder.\\" A concrete lion was stolen from a Greytown hotel by family members, and was to become associated by family members with Moses' behaviour; the family said she was acting like a lion. The family emblem was a lion, with at least one family member having a tattoo of a lion and the words 'Family united' over it. When they became concerned with her behaviour, Moses' family consulted kaumatua (elder) Timi Rahi, who prayed for her and blessed her, and advised the family to return the lion, which they did. Rahi instructed the family that it was their responsibility to carry out the healing. After Rahi left, a prolonged mƒÅkutu lifting was performed by her predominantly maternal family at the Wainuiomata flat of Moses' late grandmother. There was no evidence as to who suggested that Moses was possessed or suffering from a curse, or who suggested that a mƒÅkutu lifting was required. The ceremony was improvised, as none of those involved had any knowledge of the procedure for a mƒÅkutu lifting. During the ceremony, so much water was used that the carpet had become soaked, and so a small hole in the floor had to be made for drainage. The woman's eyes were injured as people picked at the demons they saw in them, and neighbours heard rhythmic stomping and thumping throughout the night. At or about 8:00 AM on 12 October 2007, Janet Moses died by drowning. Her father, who had travelled from Christchurch through the night to support his daughter, was not informed until his arrival at 4:30 PM. Nine hours after the death the police were called. Trial Much of the trial centred on the issue of consent, that is whether Moses was a willing participant in the ritual. The trial ran for 29 days and 101 witnesses, many of them giving testimony relating to cultural and religious practices. The jury deliberated for 20 hours before convicting five of the eight maternal family members facing charges (another family member was discharged by the judge mid-trial). None of the convicted family members were sentenced to custodial sentences, the judge instead handing down community-based sentences. At the trial, Charlie Moses (Janet's paternal grandfather) took a stance supporting the defendants: \\"We've made our peace with them. They didn't know what they were doing, even though I told them not to go down that road. They chose to do it anyway. For that mistake ... they're going to pay for the rest of their lives. I wish them well all the same.\\" As is common in New Zealand court cases, a number of those connected to the case have name suppression to prevent the identification of under-age victims. The eventual coroners inquest strongly recommended that the family consult tohunga (experts) or experienced kaumatua (elders) before taking action on suspected mƒÅkutu. Both Pou Temara, professor of MƒÅori language and traditions at Waikato University, and Rawiri Taonui, head of Canterbury University's School of Maori and Indigenous Studies, said that the advice was sensible and that MƒÅori would continue mƒÅkutu lifting practices.

Born in Shaftesbury, Dorsetshire, England, Bennett first worked for the British government in the Commissariat Department and moved to St. John's, Newfoundland, in the early 1820s to work in his brother Charles' mercantile business. Both brothers became important members of the business community and his brother later served as Premier of Newfoundland. In 1828, Bennett married Hannah Hutchings. He entered politics in 1832 running for House of Assembly for Twillingate and Fogo. He became Speaker of the House of Assembly in 1834 opposing William Carson as a conservative supporter and remained as speaker until 1837 when he did not run for election. Bennett also held a number of appointed positions in the government after he chose not to run for further office. He was chosen for these appointments because the governor, Sir John Harvey, wanted both brothers to be part of the newly formed government. Bennett remained active in politics until he was appointed as a stipendiary magistrate, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1870. In 1870, after his brother Charles became Premier of Newfoundland, Thomas returned to England. He died in Shaftesbury at the age of 83.

At the time of their detention by Iranian troops, the three Americans were on vacation from their jobs in the region in a relatively stable, autonomous region of Iraq known as Iraqi Kurdistan. On the recommendations of locals, they hiked to see a popular local Iraqi tourist destination near the Iraq-Iran border, the Ahmed Awa waterfall. Following the hikers' capture on the Iraqi-Iranian border, a wide range of outside voices, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, and the human rights group Amnesty International, had called for the hikers' unconditional release.American Hikers Leave Iran After Prison ReleaseBy J. David Goodman and Alan Cowell September 21, 2011 Iran subsequently claimed the three were spies but offered no evidence to support its contention. Sarah Shourd was released 14 months later on \\"humanitarian grounds\\". Fattal and Bauer were convicted of \\"illegal entry\\" and \\"espionage\\" two years after their arrest and each sentenced to eight years in prison,\\"Iran jails US 'hikers' for 8 years: report\\", AP Online. 21 aug 2011. Retrieved 22 aug 2011; Iran's state television website but were released on September 21, 2011. Each of the detainees was released after payment of 5 billion rial (about US$465,000) bail was arranged by the Sultan of Oman. Background Joshua \\"Josh\\" Fattal, who grew up in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, graduated from UC Berkeley, worked as co-director of an environmental education center at Aprovecho in Oregon and travelled to Switzerland, India, China, and South Africa from January to May 2009 on a fellowship with the International Honors Program (IHP)'s \\"Health and Community\\" study abroad program. Fattal and Bauer were friends from their days at the University of California at Berkeley. Shortly after the release of the hikers, it was revealed that Jacob Fattal, the father of Joshua Fattal, is an Israeli expatriate living in the United States. To avoid revealing the fact that Josh's father is an Israeli citizen, and that half his family are Israelis, Josh's mother and brother, Alex Fattal, spearheaded the campaign for his release and his father avoided the media. Fattal had been to Israel on a few family visits. The last time Fattal was in Israel was 2007 for two weeks for his cousin's wedding. Shane Bauer, who grew up both in Onamia, Minnesota and San Leandro, California, is a freelance photojournalist and journalist who has reported for Democracy Now!, Mother Jones, The Nation, The Christian Science Monitor, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Los Angeles Times and other media outlets, using his fluency in Arabic. Sarah Emily Shourd, who grew up in Los Angeles, worked in education and social justice in Damascus, Syria, where she provided educational opportunities to refugees from the war in Iraq and taught English. Shourd was Bauer's girlfriend at the time of the arrest, and the two became engaged to be married while imprisoned. They married on May 5, 2012, in Half Moon Bay, California, in a private ceremony with friends and family. Arrest On July 31, 2009, Fattal, Shourd, and Bauer were detained by Iranian border guards while hiking in Iraqi Kurdistan. Iran claims the three crossed into its territory. The three sometimes dispute and sometimes accept this claim. The three American detainees have stated they were simply hikers who did not realize that they were in Iran and that they actually have lengthy backgrounds as social justice activists. They had been living and active in the Middle East, and were on holiday in Iraqi Kurdistan, an autonomous region of Iraq free from the sectarian struggle that dominates much of Iraq. They had been advised of the suitability of the region for a holiday by friends who had been there and through Internet research; and were recommended the Ahmed Awa waterfall, a popular Kurdish tourist destination, by a number of local people whilst they were in Sulaymaniyah. After visiting the waterfall, they continued walking in Iraqi Kurdistan until they unknowingly walked along the unmarked Iraq-Iran borderline, at times stepping just feet into Iran. In June 2010, an article in The Nation indicated that two villagers said the hikers were accosted by Iranian authorities while they were on the Iraqi side of the border. Their companion, Shon Meckfessel, was not detained, as he stayed behind at the Hotel Miwan in Sulaymaniyah because of a cold.Meckfessel, Shon. \\"Statement on Missing US Hikers\\", The Nation, August 17, 2009. He had intended to join them the following day. Detention The exact circumstances of their detention are unknown, but is illustrated in the first person by each of the three in their book, A Sliver of Light, released March 18, 2014. They were held in Evin Prison, section 209. The three were in solitary confinement for the first four months. Bauer and Shourd could communicate during the first month, but Fattal was totally isolated. Shourd remained in solitary confinement after Fattal and Bauer were put in the same cell at which point the three spent time together each day for two 30-minute periods. Beside a five-minute phone call in March, 2010, the three detainees were not allowed to communicate with their families until May, 2010. Swiss consular officials were able to visit them on September 29 and October 29, 2009 and confirmed they did not appear to have been physically mistreated (Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran because the United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Iran). However, upon the release of Fattal and Bauer on September 25, 2011, Shourd stated, \\"Bauer was beaten and Fattal forced down a flight of stairs.\\"\\"Freed hikers: Iran held us because we're American\\", by Associated Press, September 26, 2010 In their memoir, Bauer reveals that he was not beaten but rather severely threatened. Mothers of the three applied for visas in January 2010 to visit their sons and daughter and left for Iran in May 2010 after the government granted the visas. \\"U.S. Detainees' Mothers Meet Them in Tehran, Appeal for Release\\", by Ladane Nasseri, Business Week, May 20, 2010 The three were united with their mothers for two days in May 2010 while remaining in detention. Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd, who were already in a relationship when they were detained, became engaged while incarcerated and married after their release. Release of Sarah Shourd On September 14, 2010, after more than a year in prison, Sarah Shourd was released on 5 billion rial (about US$465,000) bail, paid by the Sultan of Oman. Iran's judiciary also announced that the pre-trial detention of Fattal and Bauer would be extended for two more months, at that time. Shourd remained a defendant but was not required by Iran to return for trial along with Fattal and Bauer in 2011. Iran officials stated she was released on humanitarian grounds due to her declining health. She suffered mental health deterioration due to her solitary confinement for such an extended period of time. Shourd's bail did not require that she remain in Iran, but her case would still go to trial along with Fattal and Bauer. Shourd's mother has said she had been denied treatment for serious health problems, including a breast lump and precancerous cervical cells. In May 2011, Shourd announced that she would not return to Iran for trial, citing acute ill-health. Her lump turned out to be non-cancerous, however it offered a way out of returning. Trial On July 31, 2011, Fattal and Bauer were tried by the Revolutionary Court of the Islamic Republic of Iran. On August 20, 2011, they were convicted of \\"illegal entry\\" and \\"espionage\\" and sentenced to a total of eight years in prison, each. \\"According to an informed source with the judiciary, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, the two detained American citizens, have been each sentenced to three years in prison for illegal entry to the Islamic Republic of Iran,\\" the Iran's state television website reported. It also stated that the two have separately been \\"sentenced to five years in prison on charges of espionage for the American intelligence agency\\". Their Iranian attorney, Masoud Shafiee, thought \\"the sentence was not consistent with the charges.\\" Illegal entry rarely has such a harsh punishment and spying can carry a death sentence in Iran.\\"Iran jails US 'hikers' for 8 years: report\\", AP Online. 21 aug 2011.

Curry, Ann. Interview with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Today, MSNBC, reproduced on YouTube; September 18, 2009. In September 2009, Ahmadinejad promised that he would ask the judiciary to treat the case with maximum lenience and expeditiously, but despite many public statements that a judicial proceeding was imminent there was no hearing or movement on their case for nearly eight months. On November 9, 2009, it was announced they would be charged for espionage by Iranian authorities. The detainees were consistently denied access to their lawyer and Swiss officials were stonewalled. On February 15, 2009 [2010?] Mohammad Javad Larijani, the secretary general of Iran‚Äôs High Council for Human Rights, said it was \\"quite possible\\" the Americans had strayed into Iran by mistake. At the beginning of August 2010, the Iranian government reiterated its belief that the trio should stand trial for illegal entry, and announced it was considering other charges such as \\"intentionally acting against Iranian security\\". On July 31, 2011, the two had their final hearing of the trial. On August 20, 2011 the two hikers were sentenced to 3 years for illegal entry and 5 years for espionage, a total of 8 years.

(The judiciary answers to the country's supreme leader.) Fattal and Bauer were released on September 21 and taken by a diplomatic convoy to a plane that took them to Oman. Shafiei said the bail of 5 billion rial (about US$465,000) for each of the men was posted, and they would be released into the custody of either Swiss diplomats or an Omani delegation. Omani officials, who maintain good relations with both Iran and the U.S., reportedly played a key role in negotiations with Iran and may have paid the almost $1 million bail. The two men were released from prison and flown back to the United States via Oman on September 21, 2011, following a 10 billion rial (about US$930,000) bail-for-freedom deal posted by Oman. Once Fattal and Bauer were back on American soil, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Joshua Fattal's Iraqi-born Jewish father, Jacob, had emigrated to Israel as a child and later came to the United States, where he married Fattal's mother, Laura. In an effort not to draw attention to their ties with Israel after Josh's arrest, the family decided that rather than having his father involved in public efforts for Josh's release, the task would go to Josh's brother, Alex, a doctoral student at Harvard University, and to Josh's mother, Laura, who was born in the United States. Aftermath As early as 2009, according to WikiLeaks, Oman offered to arrange secret talks between the US and Iran, which hadn't had diplomatic relations for 30 years. But it was the detention of the American hikers by Iran that brought Oman into a mediating role between the two sides and helped win the release of the detainees. Ironically, efforts to win the release of the hikers turned out to be instrumental in making the clandestine diplomacy to reach an agreement on the nuclear program of Iran possible: after this successful mediation, Sultan Qaboos offered to facilitate a US‚ÄìIran rapprochement. In March, US and Iranian officials met in Oman, Secretary of State John Kerry followed up in May, and the talks took on a momentum of their own after Hassan Rouhani replaced Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran‚Äôs June elections.http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/Olive- Press/2013/1124/The-man-behind-secret-US-Iran-talks-Sultan-Qaboos The memoir A Sliver of Light is about the event.

Green (May 27, 1936 ‚Äì May 10, 1989) was the first black New York City Schools Chancellor. He served in this capacity from March 1988 to May 1989. Early life Green was born in Menifee, Arkansas in 1936. When he was two years old, Green and his three siblings traveled by train with their mother, who moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. He grew up in a Minneapolis housing project, and spent time in a reform school. He later rose to become a teacher, principal, and then the first black Superintendent of the Minneapolis Public Schools. Selection as Chancellor Green was selected over other black finalist Dr. Bernard Gifford to become the first black Chancellor of the New York City Public Schools. Green had the support of New York City Board of Education President Robert F. Wagner, Jr. over United Federation of Teachers President Sandra Feldman, who favored Dr. Gifford. On March 3, 1988, Green was installed as Chancellor at a ceremony at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. He inherited a school system plagued by low graduation rates, a high dropout rate, truancy, guns and other violence, and assembled a team of educators to work with him in addressing these issues and making a difference in academics and safety for the schoolchildren of New York City. In the fall of 1988, Green and UFT President Sandra Feldman made peace with each other by holding a human-sized yellow pencil together on a public school stage, as they welcomed the only group of new schoolteachers which he recruited into the system at a special ceremony. Death Green, 52, was a lifelong asthmatic. After arriving in New York City, the air quality due to pollution bothered him, and he had been taken to the hospital having trouble breathing after becoming chancellor. On the evening of May 10, 1989, Green suffered an asthma attack at his apartment in Manhattan. He told his wife \\"Gwen, I'm not going to make it this time,\\" and died before help arrived. The official cause of death was cardiac arrest due to inability to breathe. He was returned for burial in Minnesota. A memorial service was held at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York, with the eulogy given by New York City Mayor Edward Koch. Memorial Award, Playground and School The Council of the Great City Schools, the nation's voice for urban education, presents the nation's highest urban education award annually, the Richard Green and Edward Garner Award. (Garner was former school board president of Denver, Colorado). The award is presented to an urban school superintendent or school board member in alternative years. The winner receives a $10,000 college scholarship to present to a student. The City of New York Parks Department subsequently dedicated and opened the Dr. Richard Green Playground on Sutter Avenue in Brooklyn. The city also named two schools after him: the Richard R. Green High School of Teaching in Manhattan and the Richard R. Green Middle School #113 (formerly Olinville Junior High School) in the Bronx in his memory. Richard Green Central Park School in Minneapolis is also named for the chancellor.

In 2009-10 she was held as a political hostage in Iran's Evin Prison for 410 days under accusations of espionage. She subsequently coauthored a book about the experience with her fellow hostages Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer. On Sept 14, 2010, the Iranian government released Shourd to the care of the Omani government.  Iranian trial and imprisonment, and calls for release  In July, 2009, Shourd was on a weekend trip with her then-boyfriend Shane Bauer and their friend Josh Fattal‚Äîwho was visiting from USA. Shourd and Bauer lived in Damascus, Syria back then. On July 31, 2009, Shourd was captured by Iranian border police while hiking around a popular tourist destination, Ahmad Awa, in Iraqi Kurdistan, which was considered an American tourist-friendly destination. The soldiers accused them of illegally crossing into Iran and arrested them on the spot. They were then driven to Evin Prison, in Tehran, where Shourd spend 410 days in solitary confinement in the political ward resulting her in suffering from extreme depression and anxiety. The arrest of Shourd and her two friends led to a global efforts campaigning for their release. Amnesty International also called on the Iranian authorities and demanded for the release of Shourd along with Bauer and Fattal. In 2010, Iran said they would release Shourd owing to her poor health condition (she was diagnosed with a pre-cancerous condition) after holding her more than a year in jail after a payment of bail of $500,000. She was finally released in September 2010 after a deal was brokered by the Swiss embassy that represents the US interests in Iran owing to the absence of any diplomatic ties between USA and Iran since 1979. Post her release, She stated that she was released because she was a woman and in solitary confinement and that her health condition had nothing to do with it. Shourd and her family publicly thanked Oman for playing a crucial role in making arrangements for securing her bail. She also thanked Ayatollah Khomeini and President Ahmadinejad for her compassionate release from detention because she feared that an absence of such a statement, Bauer and Fattal would not be free. She was officially indicted of espionage and illegal entry by Iran. The then President of USA Barack Obama also issued a statement that he was pleased that she was released and was being reunited with her family.  Personal  Bauer proposed to Shourd while in the prison and the latter accepted. They got married on May 5, 2012 in California. They were subsequently divorced in 2019.  Education  Shourd did her Bachelors of Arts in 2001 from University of Berkeley. She was also a UC Berkeley Visiting Scholar in 2014.  Career  As a journalist, Shourd has published on a variety of platforms, such as the New York Times, Mother Jones, Reuters, Daily Beast, Salon, San Francisco Magazine, SF Chronicle, and many more. Shourd wrote, produced, and later directed a play on the subject of solitary confinement, The BOX, which premiered at Z Space in San Francisco in 2016, where it was directed by Cuban playwright Michael John Garc√©s. The play is based on the two-year investigation Shourd conducted while working with watchdog organization Solitary Watch and as a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley's Center for Law and Society, wherein she collected over 75 testimonies from prisoners kept in isolation in prisons across the U.S. In 2019, she was awarded the J S Knight fellowship at Stanford University.

Her distinctive alto voice brought her to popular attention immediately before World War II. Her popularity peaked in the 1950s, with recordings on the Pozna≈Ñ-based Mewa and then the Polskie Nagrania labels. Her best-known song was Pierwszy siwy w≈Ços (First Gray Hair), a nostalgic tango written by Kazimierz Winkler and Henryk Hubertus Jab≈Ço≈Ñski originally for singer Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg.Liner notes, Polskie Nagrania XL 0833, 1972 Career While still in Warsaw immediately before the outbreak of World War II, she became involved with the Ali Baba Theatre, established by the entertainer Kazimierz Krukowski. Wartime found her working as a courier in the underground Polish Armia Krajowa in the east of Poland. Under her cover name 'Marta', she entered and won a talent contest in Vilnius in 1940, after which she sang in the city at the popular nightclub Sztralla Artyst√≥w, as well as engagements in 1940-1941 with the orchestra of Ludwik Sempolinski and entertainer Janusz Minkiewicz's satirical cabaret \\"Ksantyp\\". After the war, she settled in L√≥d≈∫ and began a long collaboration with the Lopatowski Brothers Orchestra that resulted in a string of recordings including the hits Czy pamiƒôtasz tƒô noc w Zakopanem? (Do You Remember That Night In Zakopane?) and Wspominalam ten dzie≈Ñ (I Remembered That Day). As her popularity grew, in 1950 Mirska received an invitation from Warsaw to work with the well-known Polish Radio Dance Orchestra. She accepted the offer, which gave her access to material created by the most talented and popular composers and songwriters of the day. Her plaintive and heart-felt interpretation of Pierwszy siwy w≈Ços (First Gray Hair) became a great radio hit in 1956, and became the most requested song at her concerts for the rest of her career. It was re-recorded in 1972 for release in an album (Polskie Nagrania XL 0833) of 12 selections drawn from her extensive repertoire. The song was also recorded in the Czech language after gaining regional popularity in Bratislava. In addition to her radio work, Mirska recorded and performed through the remainder of the 1950s and in the early 1960s with numerous revues and variety shows, including the comedy revue Buffo. She sang with the Jan Cajmer Radio Orchestra and the Edward Czerny Dance Orchestra, and toured exhaustively throughout Poland. She also appeared in Warsaw with the German National Radio Orchestra (Kurt Henkels, conductor).Liner notes, Polskie Nagrania XL 0833, 1972Encyklopedia Internautica, GRUPA INTERIA.PL Sp. z o.o.

Warszawa (Warsaw): Wydawnictwo (Publisher) Iskry, 2010 Personal life In Vilnius in 1939 Mirska secretly married Jan Zielenewski, an officer in the Merchant Marine with whom she had corresponded since 1938, and with whom she described having fallen in love at first sight upon meeting him in Vilnius for the first time. The couple planned for a formal ceremony later, after his anticipated return from military exercises in Bydgoszcz to where he was posted. This never took place, as Zieleniewski died in the opening days of the September Campaign to repulse the Nazi aggression on Poland. After the war, Mirska married Zbigniew Reiniger, the percussionist of the Lopatowski Brothers Orchestra. She remained heartbroken, however, for the rest of her life, often signing letters and correspondence as Marta Mirska- Zieleniewska-Reinigier or Marta Zieleniewski-Reiniger. She wrote poetry, after the end of her musical career; the poem 'Wspomnienie' (Reminiscence) was dedicated to her lost love Zieleniewski. By the mid 1960s Mirska's popularity waned due to changing musical tastes to which she did not adapt. She stopped recording and performing in 1966, at the age of 48, as her drinking and health problems began to take a toll. In her later years she lived a recluse, in relative poverty and neglect, looking after her husband who was paralysed after a stroke. Mirska and Reiniger had no children; both died in 1991.

Life He was probably born about 1566, graduated B.A. at St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1587, and M.A. in 1590. In the interval he made a pilgrimage to Rome. On his return to England he was undermaster in a school, and studied the civil and canon law. In 1600 he purchased the registrarship of the diocese of Ely; in 1602 he was admitted a member of the College of Advocates. About the same time he was appointed co- registrar, and shortly afterwards chancellor of the diocese of Peterborough. Thomas Dove, bishop of Peterborough, made him his vicar, official, and commissary general, jointly with Henry Hickman, on 10 June 1615. In the following year he took the degree of LL.D. at Cambridge. In 1617 he was appointed by the dean and chapter of Lincoln commissary of their peculiars in the counties of Northampton, Rutland, Huntingdon, and Leicester. He had now established a reputation as an ecclesiastical lawyer, and in 1619 he was consulted by John Williams, dean of Salisbury, in reference to some delicate cases. A strong supporter of the royal prerogative, he carried matters with a high hand against the Puritans in Northamptonshire, compelling them to attend church regularly on the Sunday, to observe holy days, and to contribute to church funds, imposing penances on recusants, and commuting them for fines, and holding courts by preference at inconvenient times and places, fining those who failed to appear. In 1621 the mayor and corporation of Northampton presented a petition to parliament complaining of these grievances, and the speaker issued his warrant for the examination of witnesses. The king, however, intervened to stop the proceedings, and during his progress through Northamptonshire knighted Lambe on 26 July at Castle Ashby. In 1623 Lambe was selected by Williams, now bishop of Lincoln, to be his commissary; but Williams in 1626 refused to sanction some proceedings proposed by Lambe against some Leicestershire conventiclers. Lambe secretly informed the privy council against him. No immediate steps were taken against the bishop, but Lambe's information and the evidence were preserved for possible future use. Lambe was a member of the high commission court from 1629 until its abolition by the Long Parliament, and was one of Laud's most active supporters throughout that period. In the autumn of 1633 he succeeded Sir Henry Marten as dean of the arches in the court of Canterbury. On 25 February 1635 he was appointed commissary of the archdeaconries of Leicestershire and Buckinghamshire. In 1637 he was commissioned to exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the county of Leicester during the suspension of Bishop Williams. On 26 January 1640 he was appointed chancellor and keeper of the great seal to Queen Henrietta Maria. As the Long Parliament met, the parishioners of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, whom he had compelled to maintain two organs and an organist, petitioned for redress, and on 1 February 1641 Lambe was summoned to appear before a committee of the House of Commons to answer the charge. He made default, was sent for 'as a delinquent,' and on 22 February was produced at the bar in a poor state. He made formal submission on 6 March, and was released on bail. At the same time he was harassed by proceedings in the House of Lords by the widow of one of the churchwardens of Colchester, whom he had excommunicated in 1635 for refusing to rail in the altar, and by a certain Walter Walker, whom he had unlawfully deprived of the office of commissary of Leicester. The house found both charges proved, and awarded ¬£100 to the widow and ¬£1,250 to Walker; and it was contemplated to impeach Lambe along with Laud. He fled to Oxford, where he was incorporated on 9 December 1643. His property was sequestrated. He died according to Anthony Wood in early 1647. Family Lambe had two daughters, both considered beauties, one of whom married Robert Sibthorpe; the other, Barbara, was second wife of Basil Feilding, afterwards Earl of Denbigh.

He was a Romanian and Israeli avant-garde poet and visual artist, who wrote in Romanian and French and produced surrealist and abstract drawings. He was also a medical doctor and surgeon. His work is registered with the ADAGP (Soci√©t√© des Auteurs dans les Arts Graphiques et Plastiques) and the SGDL (Soci√©t√© des Gens de Lettres). Inspired in his youth by the poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Sergei Yesenin and by the Romanian avant-garde magazine unu, he was a co-founder in the early 1930sof the magazines Alge and Via»õa ImediatƒÉ. PƒÉun set himself the goal of making poetry a living experience. He experimented briefly with licentious, ludic themes (and was thus prosecuted for pornography) before turning to Marxism and proletkult aesthetics. Like other avant-garde writers, including his friends Gherasim Luca and Dolfi Trost, he adhered to the then-illegal Romanian Communist Party. PƒÉun soon developed an interest in surrealism, and became a member of the surrealist group formed at the very start of World War II (alongside Gherasim Luca, Gellu Naum, Trost, and Virgil Teodorescu). This small community survived clandestinely during the war years, when PƒÉun himself was marginalized due to his Jewish ethnicity. It reemerged as a short-lived but very active group after the war, with many of their collective works written in French. PƒÉun also had at the time a noted debut as a surrealist painter and illustrator. Like other artists and intellectuals in Romania and elsewhere, he found himself disenchanted with Stalinism already in the late 1930s, and subsequently with the post-war Romanian communist regime.See Monique Yaari, ed., ‚ÄúInfra-noir‚Äù, un et multiple: un groupe surr√©aliste entre Bucarest et Paris, 1945-1947, Oxford: Peter Lang, 2014, pp. 22-23 Exposed to communist censorship, he stopped publishing or exhibiting his work.

In 1932, Banu»ô described him as: \\"The solitary, tormented, poseur, rebellious, ironic boy of 17, with his mouth demanding like that of a little girl (Nini's mouth), a large nose, round eyes with overgrown eyelashes, bohemian hair, [and] open-necked shirts\\". She noted that his family was well educated and spoke French at home, where they maintained a \\"beautiful atmosphere\\", and that PƒÉun himself was a good mandolin player. While still a high school student, at around age 15, PƒÉun, together with Aurel Baranga, Sesto Pals, and Gherasim Luca, approached the more senior avant-garde writers at unu. As unu editor Sa»ôa PanƒÉ recalled: \\"Because we didn't want them to look like an epigone annex of ours, for they were indeed talented, daring and nonconformist, we advised them to put out a magazine of their own and, once they established their reputation, we were to invite them over at unu.\\" Mich√§el Finkenthal, \\"Ce s-a √Ænt√Æmplat cu 'algi»ôtii' √Æn 1933?\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 1/2007 This led the youth to inaugurate, in September 1930, the magazine Alge (\\"Algae\\"), together with painter S. Perahim, who gave it its visual dimension. According to Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist, the Alge group was already receiving its cultural inspiration from surrealism and Dada, \\"favoring more or less absurd puns and provocative, violent gestures\\".Sandqvist, p. 375 Scholar Giovanni Magliocco summarizes Alge-ist philosophy as \\"a still- embryonic kind of 'surrealism', incendiary and iconoclastic, [...] a literary extremism, verbally violent and delirious, but still confused as far as programs go\\".Magliocco, p. 84 PƒÉun was probably the last to actually publish in Alge (starting with its 6th issue), which hosted some of his earliest work: a selection of strange, often erotic poetry. It includes \\"Poem cu pƒÉrul meu sƒÉlbatic\\" (Poem with My Wild Hair), \\"Poem de diminea≈£ƒÉ\\" (Morning Poem), \\"Voi oameni picaturi de otravƒÉ\\" (You Poison-Drop Men). As argued in 2001 by literary historian Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, these works, which also embrace social critique, \\"no longer shock, and their value, such as it is, transcends aesthetics.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 159‚Äì160 In October 1931, PƒÉun was also a contributor to the Alge supplement provocatively titled PulƒÉ (\\"Cock\\"), with a poem that referred to the ruling class as \\"shit\\".Sandqvist, pp. 376‚Äì377 The establishment was clamping down on the literary avant-garde, accusing it of pornography: PƒÉun was in the audience as a court tried and acquitted the pioneer surrealist Geo Bogza (November 28, 1932), whom PƒÉun had befriended in October 1931. PƒÉun was enthusiastic about Bogza's search for an anti-art, prosaic poetry, as he explained in a letter to Banu»ô: \\"what do [the Alge writers] want, after all? They are sick to their stomachs, to their tongues, after all the sweets they have been fed by the poets. By those who go for things of beauty, not things of experience [PƒÉun's emphasis]. [...] We write because life leaves us hopeless\\". In his search for an \\"original\\" format, PƒÉun even rejected being labeled a \\"modernist\\", \\"because a modernist can be allowed not to be a modernist\\". Some tensions between the unu and Alge groups were already evident: the latter for a while boycotted unu, because it had refused to publish one of Luca's texts in extenso.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 148‚Äì149 PanƒÉ referred to the other Alge supplement, titled Muci (Snot), as \\"pornography ... but not devoid of a certain humor.\\" 1933 imprisonment and Via»õa ImediatƒÉ proletkult Alge interrupted publication at some point in 1931, but was briefly revived, under Pals' direction, in March 1933. A copy of one of its issues was sent by the editors themselves to a leading conservative culture critic, former Premier Nicolae Iorga, who ordered a criminal investigation of Alge contributors, on charges of pornography.Chioaru, p. 33; CrohmƒÉlniceanu (1994), p. 162; (2001), pp. 149‚Äì150; Morar, p. 5; Sandqvist, p. 376 PƒÉun's contributions to PulƒÉ were discovered during a search of Pals' attic, when the supplement was confiscated as evidence. Together with Alge editors and contributors Baranga, Luca, Pals, and Jules Perahim, he was detained for 9 days at the VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison.Sandqvist, p. 376 Despite becoming the objects of an antisemitic campaign in newspapers such as Cuv√¢ntul and Universul, the Alge contributors only received suspended sentences.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 149‚Äì150 Pals, the non-naturalized son of Ukrainian Jews, was threatened with deportation. PƒÉun was eventually welcomed at unu, where he published in 1932 one of the most representative among his early poems, titled ‚ÄúEpitaf pentru omul-bou‚Äù (Epitaph for the Man- Ox),Magliocco, p.1 but continued to publish more conventional verse in left- wing reviews: Facla, Cuv√¢ntul Liber, Azi,Macovei & Popescu, p. 17 Geo »òerban, \\"Ascensiunea lui Dolfi Trost. Scene din via»õa avangardei la Bucure»ôti\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 576, May 2011 and even the more aesthetically traditionalist Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 161 Like the other unu writers, he clamored his belief in anti-capitalism and social justice, as well as in proletkult-style literature, and expressed alarm at the rise of fascism.Morar, pp. 4, 5; Sandqvist, p. 375 With Perahim, Luca and Miron Radu Paraschivescu, PƒÉun took directives from the illegal Communist Party, but not uncritically: on Labor Day (1 May) 1933, the party ordered them to show up for a demonstration carrying the red flag, which PƒÉun and two others refused, noting that such a parade exposed them to useless risks. Cristian Livescu, \\"Centenar Gherasim Luca, poetul mistuit de 'iubirea mereu reinventatƒÉ' (II)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, August 2013 More principled cases of distancing from the Party and outright disobedience during the period 1938 to 1940 are also documented. In December 1933, PƒÉun, Perahim and Luca co-signed with Bogza the opening manifesto of Bogza's avant-garde magazine, Via»õa ImediatƒÉ (\\"The Life Immediate\\").CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 160‚Äì161 This was a communist-inspired \\"proletarian magazine\\", partly modeled on Alexandru Sahia's Bluze Albastre. According to CrohmƒÉlniceanu, it put out four issues in all but according to other sources, only one number of this magazine actually saw the light. Ion Pop, ed., La R√©habilitation du r√™ve: Une anthologie de l'Avant-garde roumaine, Paris: Nadeau, EST, ICR, 2006, p. 144 PƒÉun was by then embarrassed by his Alge poetry, which he found childish, Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Note pentru o repozi»õionare a 'valului' suprarealist din Rom√¢nia ‚Äì 1945-1948 (I)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 576, May 2011 although Via»õa ImediatƒÉ's manifesto on art reaffirmed the core Alge thesis. It read: \\"We aim to break out of this suave past and give poetry a push into life. [...] Poetry shall have to become elementary, the way water and bread are elementary.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 161. See also Magliocco, pp. 85‚Äì86 At Cuv√¢ntul Liber, where he met the experienced journalist and literary reviewer Dolfi Trost, PƒÉun gave a versified version of the communist party ideology, with works such as Poem pentru oprimat (\\"Poem to the Oppressed One\\"). His writing was also featured in the Marxist review Era NouƒÉ, which was put out in Bucharest by N. D. Cocea. Virgil Ierunca, \\"Diagonale - Amintiri despre Ghi»õƒÉ Ionescu\\", at the Memoria Digital Library; retrieved July 17, 2014 For the next years, PƒÉun was a regular presence in the literary press. His 1938 translation from the Comte de Lautr√©amont's Songs of Maldoror accompanied Gherasim Luca's article on Lautr√©amont in the communist newspaper Reporter, which insisted on reading Lautr√©amont through the grid of Marxist literary criticism. Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Engels »ôi Lautr√©amont\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 34/2003 PƒÉun's first important work was the 1939 poem PlƒÉm√¢nul sƒÉlbatec (\\"The Savage Lung\\"), originally published in the Summer 1938 issue of Azi and the following year in book form.\\"Revista revistelor. Azi\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 3/1939, p. 713. Cf. Monique Yaari, ed., ‚ÄúInfra-noir‚Äù, un et multiple: un groupe surr√©aliste entre Bucarest et Paris, 1945-1947, Oxford: Peter Lang, 2014, p. 8 and 8 n. 17Macovei & Popescu, p. 17; Magliocco, p. 86 His poetry was veering into the apocalyptic, and, according to scholars Yaari and Magliocco, seemed to harbor a presentiment of The Holocaust.Magliocco, pp. 87‚Äì90 World War II and surrealist discoveries In early 1940, PƒÉun graduated from the University of Bucharest Faculty of Medicine. He had resumed his caste friendship with Banu»ô, having recently married. His wife was Reni Zaharia (who would also eventually become a painter of decalcomania). Yvonne Hasan, \\"Desenele lui Paul PƒÉun. Colec»õia Cabinetului de Stampe al Academiei Rom√¢ne\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 565, March 2011 Their private circle now included Marxist philosopher Constantin Ionescu Gulian, and poets Virgil Teodorescu and Ta»ôcu Gheorghiu. In the winter of 1939, PƒÉun was writing for Zaharia Stancu's newspaper, Lumea Rom√¢neascƒÉ. Apparently, while acting as a liaison between Stancu and the communists he found himself caught in between as the newspaper published articles condemning the Soviet invasion of Finland; reprimanded by Paraschivescu and Gulian, Stancu decided to make a clean break with these communists (although he would eventually build a very successful literary career under the communist regime), and sacked PƒÉun. At about the same time, Banu»ô, who still had doubts about Marxism (although she would eventually become an official, albeit somewhat conflicted, poetess of the regime), recorded in her diary that she felt \\"ashamed\\" to confront PƒÉun about everything that she herself did not have the courage and energy to do. George Neagoe, \\"√én contratimp\\", in Cultura, Nr. 472, June 2014 By 1940, PƒÉun had made his choice. Both he and Teodorescu had joined the Bucharest surrealist group, whose founders were Luca and Gellu Naum. Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Note pentru o repozi»õionare a 'valului' suprarealist din Rom√¢nia ‚Äì 1945-1948 (II)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 577, June 2011Chioaru, p. 33 Trost followed suit, having probably been co-opted by PƒÉun. The resulting circle, or \\"Group of Five\\",CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 167 was Romania's \\"third avant-garde\\" wave, and the first one to explicitly align itself with surrealism. Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Avangarda »ôi politizarea literaturii\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 32/2004 PƒÉun's was a \\"rather predictable conversion\\", according to CrohmƒÉlniceanu: \\"his own leanings and the very course of events\\" signaled a transition from generic avant-garde to specific surrealism.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 162 The members of the group carried out new experiments in collaborative writing, described by PƒÉun in 1983 as the pinnacle of surrealist automatism: \\"the artist, now a modest one, admires the great art of the encounter, of the happening.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 158 Their preference, as a group, to publish in French, signaling a thirst for international recognition and integration with European modernism,Morar, p. 4 was made impractical by the Nazi occupation of Europe. The surrealist group survived clandestinely during the repressive fascist regimes of the National Legionary State and Ion Antonescu. Its leftist ideals and the Jewish origins of three of its affiliates made it impossible for the group to express itself openly: Trost, for instance, was explicitly banned by the authorities.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 164. See also Morar, p. 5 The surrealists were not physically harmed during the Bucharest pogrom, but were exposed during those years to the antisemitic restrictions: Luca was conscripted into a forced labor detachment, while Trost was employed as a schoolteacher for the segregated Jewish schools. After Romania's involvement in the anti-Soviet war, PƒÉun's services as a physician were requisitioned, and he was sent over to provide healthcare services in POW camps. Naum, an ethnic Romanian, saw action on the front, and was discharged in 1941 with posttraumatic stress disorder.GlƒÉvan, p. 147 They were still in contact with communist affiliates such as the old-time friend, poet Stephan Roll, and, according to some interpretations, still adhered to Marxist ideology.Chioaru, p. 35 Although prevented from publishing, the Romanian surrealists produced handwritten and typewritten manuscripts, some of which, including PƒÉun's, were conceived as an artist's book. Working alongside Teodorescu and Trost, PƒÉun contributed to the texts L'Amour invisible (Invisible Love) and Diamantul conduce m√¢inile (\\"The Diamond Leads the Hands\\"), which were to be included in a planned \\"Surrealist Collection,\\" a collection that was only partially realized after the war without these two texts. The latter of the two comprised 30 prose poems, heavily indebted to the \\"Bizarre Pages\\" of Romanian avant-garde hero Urmuz.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 165‚Äì166 Surrealist revival, communist repression The 1944 King Michael's Coup which toppled Antonescu's fascist regime, and the subsequent Soviet occupation of Romania, allowed the Romanian surrealist group to briefly come out of hiding, before the second totalitarian regime experienced by their country, this one from the left, would curtail their activities. In 1945, PƒÉun changed his surname from Her»ôcovici to Zaharia. That year marked his return to publishing with the important poem Marea palidƒÉ (\\"The Pale Sea\\"),CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 162, 197; Macovei & Popescu, p. 17 as well as to visual art: he illustrated with drawings (called lovaje) Teodorescu's Butelia de Leyda plaquetteVirgil Teodorescu, Butelia de Leyda, Atelierele Tipografiei Bucovina, Bucharest, 1945 and held his first personal exhibition of surrealist drawings (see Hasan 2011, Yaari 2012 and 2014, and Stern 2011).See Radu Stern and Edward Van Voolen, eds. From Dada to Surrealism: Jewish Avant-Garde Artists from Romania, 1910-1938. Exhibition catalogue, 1 June‚Äì2 October 2011. Amsterdam: Joods Historisch Museum. The surrealist group had contacts with other writers, such as the Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, but the latter was not a member of the group (he had not lived in Romania during the war and would soon leave for France). Also joining them was Nadine Krainik, a former lover of PƒÉun's,Joshua Cohen, \\"Books. La Mort Que Je Conviens. Gh√©rasim Luca: Romanian, Surrealist, Jew, Vampire\\", in The Jewish Daily Forward, May 22, 2009 who would settle in Paris soon after the war and serve as a link between the Romanian and French surrealist groups, namely between Luca and Andr√© Breton.Catherine Hansen, \\"A Revolution in Consciousness: Dolfi Trost's Visible and Invisible\\", in ARTMargins, June‚ÄìOctober 2012, p. 186 PƒÉun's 1945 exhibition served as the basis for a surrealist happening engineered by his university colleague, poet Alexandru Lungu. Lungu plastered the drawings with labels proclaiming PƒÉun as \\"not a peacock, but an angel\\". Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Un poet √Æn oglinda dialogului\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 5/2006 Art critics were also enthusiastic; for example, Ion Frunzetti praised ‚Äúthe attitude of artistic probity and authenticity that emanates from [the work] of this impassioned [conveyor] of human nightmare.‚ÄùFrunzetti, ‚ÄúSuprarealismul nostru ≈üi Paul PƒÉun,‚Äù Victoria, 25 March 1945. In September 1946, PƒÉun exhibited, alongside Luca and Trost, his ink and pencil drawings at CƒÉminul Artei gallery, Bucharest,Macovei & Popescu, pp. 17‚Äì18 and co-wrote, with the four other group members, its catalog, L'Infra-Noir: pr√©liminaires √† une intervention sur-thaumaturgique dans la conqu√™te du d√©sirable (The Infra-black...).CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 198 His art, some of which is semi-abstract but sometimes evoking anatomical drawings, intrigued chroniclers of the day, one of whom described PƒÉun as \\"the most chaotic of the [Romanian surrealist] group [in the fight against] our daily logic\\".CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 165 Of the figurative drawings, a few are portraits and many include nude figures, depicting strange and morbid occurrences in imaginary seascapes and fantasy gardens. He sent some of his works as postcards to his friend the surrealist painter Victor Brauner (who by then was living in Paris, having escaped P√©tain's war-time regime), one of them with the message: \\"I am moved by your presence in all of my dreams.\\" According to some interpretations, similar to the brief inter-war political positioning of Andr√© Breton's surrealism, the Romanian branch had grown politicized in the 1940s, and recovered proletkult themes: Luca was referencing dialectical materialism, claiming that surrealism offered a perfect recipe against \\"right-wing deviations\\". In their 1945 essay, Dialectique de la dialectique (Dialectic of Dialectics) (Bucharest, S Surr√©alisme [series]), Trost and Luca decried the \\"imperialist war,\\" criticized Breton for failing to keep up with the progress of Hegelian and Marxist dialectics, and demanded a theoretical reexamination of surrealism. Naum, Teodorescu, and PƒÉun's manifesto of the same year, Critica mizeriei (\\"The Critique of Misery\\") (Bucharest, \\"Surrealist Collection\\"), which in a footnote criticized Luca for \\"mysticism,\\" has also been considered inspired by proletkult. However, according to a different perspective, the group by and large, while holding on to a leftist orientation, had in fact by then moved away from a Marxist view of social change and direct political involvement, working instead toward a revolution from within.On Gherasim Luca‚Äôs position, see Iulian Toma, Gh√©rasim Luca ou l‚Äôintransigeante passion d‚Äô√™tre, Paris: Honor√© Champion, 2012. This is evidenced by their collective 1946 text (\\"Infra-noir: Pr√©liminaires...\\"), analyzed in this light by Eburne in Yaari, ed., under a motto taken from PƒÉun's 1947 La Conspiration du silence: \\"The Revolution is ungraspable.\\" According to Yaari, this second view applies to PƒÉun as well, who, in the somewhat hermetic style that had become characteristic of the group, wrote, also in 1947, in Les Esprits animaux: \\"only the systematic blinding toward the partial lights of the has-been, of political and theoretical d√©j√†-vus, will provide us with the (magic) practical freedom of influencing the future with our movements. It is the dialectics of despair, its miracle, that sets now automatic action against the conspiracy of asphyxiation [...]\\". Along the same lines Virgil Ierunca states: \\"The books he published in 1947 are among the last challenges addressed to the communist regime, which henceforth would no longer tolerate a literature independent from the Jdanovist dogma.\\"Biro and Passeron, Dictionnaire g√©n√©ral du surr√©alisme et de ses environs, Paris: PUF, p. 322 By 1947, the Romanian surrealists were in direct contact with Breton, who, thanks to Brauner's intervention, included their French-language collective text, \\"Le Sable nocturne\\" (\\"Nocturnal Sand\\") in the catalogue of the 1947 Paris international surrealist exhibition (see also Ch√©nieux-Gendron, in Yaari, ed.). As Breton supposedly noted that year, Bucharest had become the capital of worldwide surrealism. Also in 1947, in addition to his two volumes of French-language poetic prose, both in the Infra-Noir Collection, Les Esprits animaux (\\"The Animal Spirits\\") and La Conspiration du silence (\\"The Conspiracy of Silence\\"),CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 162‚Äì163, 197‚Äì198; Macovei & Popescu, p. 17 PƒÉun contributed to the \\"Group of Five\\"'s volume √âloge de Malombra (\\"Malombra's Eulogy\\"). It was in part a tribute to the 1942 film and the character played by Isa Miranda, echoes of which, according to Hasan, may also be discerned in PƒÉun's ink drawings (see Friedman's analysis of the √âloge in Yaari, ed.). The imposition of a communist regime, occurring in stages after 1946, was a bitter disappointment for the surrealist group. They found themselves confronted with socialist realism, political censorship, and erotic conventionalism: some of the group's members were prevented from publishing until the liberalization of 1964. PƒÉun teamed with Luca, Trost, and, according to one account, Celan, in a common attempt to escape the country before the borders were sealed; the attempt failed, but Celan managed to flee in 1947. Teodorescu adapted himself and his style, and, a poet laureate, was even elected a member of the Romanian Academy.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (1994), pp. 186‚Äì189; GlƒÉvan, p. 148 Turning to translation work and children's literature, Naum infused his conventional poetry with surrealist elements, before making a full return to the avant-garde in the liberal year 1968.GlƒÉvan, p. 148 Luca and Trost both managed to leave legally for France via Israel in the early 1950s, where their earlier friendship degenerated into outright enmity: Trost declared Luca a \\"counterrevolutionary\\" (not in the Marxist sense, but in the sense of the surrealist ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù their group had attempted). Luca settled in Paris, where he found himself distanced by the group surrounding Breton, and his friendship with Breton took a while to develop. Exile PƒÉun led a discreet existence in the communized state, with only rare signs of literary or graphic activity noted abroad, under the pen name of Yvenez (an anagram of the French venez-y, \\"come hither\\"). For a while, in the early 1950s, he tried to mediate between Luca and Trost, but unsuccessfully. He was finally allowed to emigrate in the early 1960s, settled in Haifa, and became integrated in Israeli society as a urologist and an artist with several exhibitions both there and in Europe (for example, see Stern). In continuing to draw he moved into full abstraction, his technique seeming to some commentators mysterious or resulting from the use of supposedly unusual utensils (possibly combs). In reality, all of his work is the result of his mastery of both pencil and pen and ink drawing, combined with the use of a magnifying glass.Monique Yaari, \\"Paul Paon ou le 'hurle-silence'\\" in Monique Yaari, ed., \\"Infra-noir\\", un et multiple: un groupe surr√©aliste entre Bucarest et Paris, 1945-1947, Oxford: Peter Lang, 2014, pp. 151-198. A final, self-published,CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 162‚Äì163; Magliocco, p. 83 volume of his poetic prose came out in Haifa in 1975.The publication of this book in due form is apparently to be expected soon (‚ÄúIntroduction,‚Äù in Yaari, ed., p. 19). Called La Rose parall√®le (\\"The Parallel Rose\\"), it is infused with the language of alchemy and Kabbalah mysticism.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 163‚Äì164, 198; Macovei & Popescu, p. 17 In Romania, PƒÉun's work remained the least publicized contribution to Romanian surrealism.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 166 PanƒÉ, writing under communism, included only minimal samples of his work in an anthology of Romanian avant- garde, careful not to draw any attention to \\"politically incorrect\\" facts such as PƒÉun's emigration. Poorly reviewed by Alexandru Piru in 1968, PƒÉun's work was rediscovered in the 1980s by Marin Mincu and Ion Pop. PƒÉun was also embraced by the Romanian diaspora. Writing for Biro and Passeron's 1982 Dictionnaire g√©n√©ral du surr√©alisme, the exile literary critic Virgil Ierunca noted: \\"neo-surrealism‚Äîand more precisely the triad Gherasim Luca‚ÄìPaul PƒÉun‚ÄìD. Trost‚Äîrepresented not just a project of creative freedom [...], but also an ethics of limitless heroism\\". A small section of PlƒÉm√¢nul sƒÉlbatec was translated into French by Dumitru »öepeneag, the neo-avant-garde poet.Magliocco, p. 86 In 1983, PƒÉun entered a dialogue with anticommunist poet and scholar »òtefan Baciu, and was interviewed by Baciu's MELE newsletter (one of the very rare interviews PƒÉun ever gave).CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 158, 169 PƒÉun continued to exhibit his surrealist drawings in Israel and France. In 1985, he had a show of \\"Infra-noir Drawings\\" in Paris.Macovei & Popescu, p. 18 A year later, his work was featured in the international exhibition La Plan√®te affol√©e: Surr√©alisme, dispersion et influences, 1938-1947, Marseille. But it is in Paris that PƒÉun had his last exhibition while still alive, in autumn 1989. He died on April 9, 1994 in Haifa. His wife survived him and, for a while, kept a correspondence with Sesto Pals, who would write to her details about his own and PƒÉun's common experience at Alge. In old age, PƒÉun had corresponded with Alexandru Lungu, who dedicated to him a posthumous homage in the Bonn magazine Argo. Writing in 2001, CrohmƒÉlniceanu assessed that many of the surrealist circle's collective works, with PƒÉun's own contributions, remained \\"almost entirely unknown,\\" which is no longer the case.For numerous facsimile and illustrations, see M. Yaari, ed.,‚ÄúInfra-noir‚Äù, un et multiple (2014). PƒÉun did maintain an enduring presence in the poetry of his colleagues: with the surrealist preference for intertextuality and autofiction, he made appearances in poems by Luca and had an epitaph written by Pals. In 2010, 20 of his drawings were donated to the Romanian Academy Library, and became the object of studies by art professionals. A year later, samples of his art were included in a Romanian avant-garde retrospective at the Israel Museum Mirel Horodi, \\"Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ la Muzeul Israel din Ierusalim\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 601, November 2011 after the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam (see Stern). Some of his drawings and papers, kept in Teodorescu's personal collection, were improperly preserved after the latter's death in 1987, and are presumed lost.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (1994), p. 189 Literary work In his early youth, PƒÉun declared that his poems from that period could only be read at the top of one's voice‚Äîa demand that, according to literary historian Geo »òerban, may show PƒÉun's debt at the time to Russian Futurism. As CrohmƒÉlniceanu notes, works such as \\"Poem cu pƒÉrul meu sƒÉlbatic\\" and the Via»õa ImediatƒÉ manifesto were heavily indebted to Geo Bogza, whereas PlƒÉm√¢nul sƒÉlbatec, which still made references to \\"social revolt\\", was nevertheless \\"at the antipodes of [Bogza's] 'elementary poetry'.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 160‚Äì162 According to the literary reviewer at Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, PlƒÉm√¢nul sƒÉlbatec was \\"confusing\\" and \\"prolix\\", with echoes from Sergei Yesenin and Vladimir Mayakovsky, but with individual \\"qualities worth noting\\"‚Äîsuch as \\"a convincing and robust literary impetus.\\" The same was noted at the time by Banu»ô: \\"Lots of temperament, and intensity, and expressive power, and assurance in using a quite varied material. But amorphous. Poetry is not, alas, what this is. Poetry is a mystery, one that can be performed by any religion, but which requires one to respect its inner rites.\\" Today's readers are more positive toward PlƒÉm√¢nul sƒÉlbatec than was the budding, more traditional poetess.

Magliocco, while considering the earlier texts as \\"minor experiments,\\" \\"well-constructed mechanisms destined to shock 'the bourgeoisie,'\\" finds in PlƒÉm√¢nul sƒÉlbatec similarities with the more famous works of Benjamin Fondane and Yvan Goll.Magliocco, pp. 88, 89 The moral of the work, he argues is: \\"a desegregation of the Self. The dissolution of one's identity, also a destruction and a rebirth of one's own poetic verb.\\"Magliocco, p. 93 Also impressed with the poem, CrohmƒÉlniceanu evidences its \\"cyphered lyricism\\" and \\"fresh associations\\": But it is especially Marea palidƒÉ that earned CrohmƒÉlniceanu's praise: \\"a little po√®me-fleuve of a strange beauty, whose erotically charged atmosphere and bizarre imagery place it clearly on the surrealist lyric map.\\" CrohmƒÉlniceanu also notes that, as surrealist and French-language pieces, the volumes published in the Infra-Noir series \\"easily slide into a conceptual prose of the essay type\\", with eulogies to Love and The Air.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 162‚Äì163 In Malombra, PƒÉun and his colleagues invented a female erotic archetype, the \\"pure love of the absolute essence\\", which (critic Cristian Livescu notes), \\"meant to substitute to the plain woman, the predictable, limited woman\\". The authors exclaimed: \\"Never have we been so dazed, so seduced by the difficulty of elevating the revolution to the heights of poetry\\". The surrealistic imprint was still visible on PƒÉun's poetry and art during all of his mature years.CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), pp. 164‚Äì165 According to CrohmƒÉlniceanu, with the Kabbalistic language of La Rose parall√®le, PƒÉun reinterpreted some of the core themes of Jewish mythology, in the same spirit as the entire surrealist movement, which \\"believed in universal analogy and in the other principles of magic, especially the magic of the word.\\"CrohmƒÉlniceanu (2001), p. 163 Examples are the eulogizing of Lilith as the Mother of Man, and the black moon personified: Most importantly, as CrohmƒÉlniceanu points out, PƒÉun's \\"graphic work cannot be separated from his poetic works, together constituting a valuable whole.\\" Notes References *Adam Biro and Ren√© Passeron, Dictionnaire g√©n√©rale du surr√©alisme et ses environs, Paris, PUF, 1985. *Dumitru Chioaru, \\"Gherasim Luca ‚Äì inventator al iubirii non-oedipiene »ôi al poeziei sonore\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 7/2012, pp. 33‚Äì37 *Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, **Amintiri deghizate, Editura Nemira, Bucharest, 1994. **Evreii √Æn mi»ôcarea de avangardƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, Editura Hasefer, Bucharest, 2001. *Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Note pentru o repozi»õionare a 'valului' suprarealist din Rom√¢nia ‚Äì 1945-1948 (II)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 577, June 2011. *Gabriela GlƒÉvan, \\"The Other Side of Surrealism.

In England  Early ministry  Jamie Allen with daughter Carrie Allen was raised in Woodbridge, Suffolk.BBC: A Country Parish. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1999, at the age of 28, after first working as a DJ and as a Religious Education and English teacher. He was a curate for 3 years at St Mary's Abbey in the parish of Nuneaton until 2002, when he was appointed Rector of Seend, Bulkington and Poulshot.  \\"A Country Parish\\"  Jamie Allen and his family were the subject of an eight-part Tiger Aspect Productions British television documentary and reality television programme A Country Parish. This covered the family's move from Nuneaton to three traditional village parishes in Wiltshire. The series was filmed over the course of a year, and examined the life of a clergy family and the dilemmas of parish ministry. The series included stories such as : * The re-uniting of an estranged family * Fox hunting and Allen's decision not to bless the hounds and horses prior to the opening meet, and the community's response to this * Loss and grief, through the story of a missing pet dog, and through deaths and funerals in the parish * Allen's taking part in a Peace March against the backdrop of a village of many retired military The series attracted a large viewing audience and there was huge media attention and interest. In 2003 Jamie moved from Wiltshire and resumed ministry in a less-publicized location. He served as a priest in Buckinghamshire before becoming the vicar of St Andrew's Parish in Great Cornard in late 2005. In New Zealand  Move to Aotearoa New Zealand  In 2010, Allen moved with his wife and his four children to be vicar, and then dean, of the newly consecrated Taranaki Cathedral Church of St Mary, New Zealand. The cathedral was consecrated on 6 March 2010,and Allen was installed as its foundational dean.  Carrie Allen  Earlier in 2009, Allen's second child, Carrie, had been diagnosed with a rare form of soft- tissue cancer - rhabdomyosarcoma. She was given front-line treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and surgery to remove the lump in her arm. The family moved to New Zealand just as Carrie completed this treatment, and for some time the cancer was in remission. Tragically, it returned meta-statically in 2011. In 2012, a fundraising concert (called \\"Carrie's Concert\\") was held at Taranaki Cathedral hosted by Carrie - with over $8000 raised to benefit the Child Cancer Foundation and CanTeen - at which Dave Dobbyn performed. Carrie died on 15 September 2012. As her father was the serving dean at the cathedral, permission was granted for the closed churchyard to be re-opened for her burial.  Taranaki Cathedral  From 2009 to 2016 Allen served as Dean of Taranaki Cathedral. His time at the new cathedral was marked with tragedy through the loss of his daughter, and a number of significant events. This included ; * Establishing the parish church as a cathedral - which was expressed through the weaving of an altar frontal to peace, all sewn by visitors, and depicting the 39 communities of the region (around which he did a pilgrimage with a local museum curator) * Reading the entire Bible aloud (with only 5 minute breaks) as a fundraiser * The relocation of historic hatchments from the walls of the cathedral; war emblems which were a cause of pain to MƒÅori and many others * The establishment of a Garden of Remembrance featuring large emblems of Peace from the MƒÅori community of Parihaka * The restoration of many graves in the historic churchyard, and the installation of floodlighting to light the cathedral (in colour, according to the season) by night * Forming a link between Taranaki Cathedral and Coventry Cathedral, through becoming a member of the international community of the Cross of Nails * The closure of the cathedral and relocation of activities to the hall, following a report on the structural integrity of the building  Taranaki Retreat  In July 2014, prompted by the loss of their daughter, the Allens decided to sell up their family home and to use the funds to establish a charitable trust which would offer a place for people to stay when going through tragedy - with the specific aim of suicide prevention. This was inspired by Allen's experience of pastoral work with families who had lost a loved-one to suicide where there was nowhere to turn to for support. The build of the facility was funded by the Allens' donation; by local businesses, and others in the community who had been affected by suicide - and through grants. The facility opened in March 2017 and offers free breaks (or support at home) for people dealing with tragedy or where people are dealing with suicidal thoughts. The Allen family were nominated and chosen as Taranaki Daily News Person of the year 2017 for their work through Taranaki Retreat.

It is in the central Kentron district and links Abovyan Street with Freedom Square on Tumanyan street. It is long and wide. Located in downtown Yerevan, the avenue is mainly home to luxurious residential buildings, high-end branded shops, commercial offices, coffee shops, hotels, restaurants, and nightclubs. History The symbolic key of Yerevan The Avenue at night Although it was planned by the main architect of Yerevan Alexander Tamanian in 1924, the actual plan was never implemented during the Soviet period. A decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Yerevan City Council decided to set for the construction of the avenue. According to the original plans, the National Gallery and the History Museum at Republic Square were never meant to be built on the current location, so Northern Avenue ends near their building, rather than opening directly into Republic Square. The construction of the avenue started on 26 March 2002, based on the original plan of Alexander Tamanian which was developed and redesigned by architect Narek Sargsyan.Yerevan History Museum: the Northern Avenue The construction of the avenue was financed by the private sector. First, the government bought up all the small informal properties along the route of the street, consolidated the land into larger, more feasible lots for high-rise developers, and auctioned those lots off. This process was done section by section, and raised a great deal of complaints from the previous landowners. Based on its revised design, the Northern Avenue is home to 4 small squares and 11 buildings with an average height of 9 floors. Many types of stone were used in the construction including basalt, granite, travertine and tufa. The avenue has a 2-story underground parking area.Underground parking of the Northern Avenue The official inauguration of the avenue took place on 16 November 2007. However, it was entirely renovated in 2014, and the 2-story parking area was partially converted into an underground shopping mall, with escalators leading on the Northern Avenue. In March 2019, a section of Northern Avenue was dedicated as Europe Square in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Council of Europe.

It was to act as reinforcement to convoys under attack, with the capacity to actively hunt and destroy U-boats, rather than be restricted to escort duties. Comprising six sloops of the Black Swan-class, the group was led by Captain F.J. \\"Johnnie\\" Walker, Britain's most successful anti-submarine warfare commander, in . The combination of an active hunting group and a charismatic, determined and innovative anti-submarine specialist such as Walker proved to be a potent force; 2 SG was the most successful anti-submarine unit of the war, being credited with the destruction of 23 U-boats during two years of active service. Formation Officially called 2nd Escort Group, it was more commonly referred to as the \\"2nd Support Group\\" (2 SG). It was formed in April 1943, one of five such support groups. Its purpose was to provide reinforcement to convoys at sea, being equipped to spend extended periods at sea moving from one convoy to another as needed. Its function primarily was to assist a convoy's escort in its defence, though it also had the facility to spend time, which escorts did not have, to continue attacks on U-boats to a successful conclusion rather than having to break off to maintain the guard on the convoy. Walker, however, was determined that the group would be active in destroying U-boats and impressed this aim on his commanders from the outset.Wemyss p.74 The group comprised six sloops of the Black Swan class, making it a highly uniform group, and the sloop design was well suited to the task, with good endurance, adequate speed and specialized anti-submarine armament. In addition, Walker had developed a range of A/S tactics, which 2 SG became adept at, such as the \\"creeping attack\\" and the \\"barrage attack\\". The group originally comprised: * (Capt. F.J. Walker), * (Cdr. R.M. Aubrey), * (Lt.Cdr. R.E.S. Hugonin), * (Lt.Cdr. F.B. Proudfoot), * (Lt.Cdr. D.E.G. Wemyss), * (Lt.Cdr. W.F. Segrave)Wemyss p.73 During April the group was engaged in working up and training; Starling, Wild Goose and Kite were new ships, and none had worked together before. Under Walkers training (previously the Experimental Commander at HMS Osprey, the RN Anti-submarine training school) the group became a highly effective and successful unit. The primary goal and strategy of the 2nd Escort Group as 'hunter-killers of U-boats' was reflected in the group practice of playing the song 'A-Hunting We Will Go' upon entering and leaving harbour. This practice was emulated by other Royal Navy ships and was evidence of the change of attitude and strategy of anti- submarine units from defenders to hunter/killers of U-Boats. History First patrols The group's first patrol in May 1943 was uneventful. There were several major convoy battles during the month, but none involving 2 SG. The group operated in support of HX 235 and ONS 8, sailing ahead in an attempt to encounter and breach any U-boat patrol lines drawn across the convoy routes. The group's first success came in June. Its first U-boat was detected on 1 June 1943: fortuitously on a fine day, and identified by a Lt. Earl Howe Pitt, the event was dubbed another \\"Glorious First of June\\" by Walker.Wemyss p.76 Over a 15-hour period the group found, tracked and destroyed , in the longest hunt of the Atlantic campaign up to that point, and a vindication of the support group ethos, leaving ships free of escort responsibilities to destroy U-boats. Bay offensive After a refit at Liverpool, after which Cygnet departed to another group, 2SG was assigned to \\"Operation Musketry\\", an attempt in concert with Coastal Command to interdict the U-boat transit routes across the Bay of Biscay. On 24 June 1943 the group was successful in destroying and , though Starling was damaged in the process of ramming U-119 and was forced to retire. Walker elected to stay with the group, exchanging commands with Wild Goose, and, after the group returned to port, with Kite. 2 SG was joined at this point by (Lt.Cdr C. Gwinner), as a replacement for the damaged Starling. On 30 July 1943 Walker's group saw further success when they encountered a group of three U-boats on the surface (two were vital submarine type XIV replenishment boats known as \\"Milk Cows\\") while in the Bay of Biscay. He signalled the \\"general chase\\" to his group and fired at them, causing damage that prevented them from diving. Two of the submarines, , a Type XIV, and , a Type IX/C40, were then sunk by Walker's group, and the second Type XIV, , by Australian Short Sunderland aircraft. But whilst the remainder of the operation saw the destruction of 20 U-boats over a nine-week period,Blair p.274 2 SG's time was unproductive, and no further successes were recorded. Atlantic operations In September 1943, after a further refit, 2 SG went to the North Atlantic, in the company of the escort carrier . The group was joined by (Lt.Cdr R.S. Abrams), while Woodpecker was in for repairs. In October, in concert with B-7 Escort Group, the group worked in support of ON 207. No successes were recorded, though the convoy battle saw three U-boats destroyed, with no ships lost.Blair pp.436-438 However, in November 1943, in operations around HX 264, 2 SG accounted for two more U-boats, and . Whilst the United States Navy had had much success using carrier groups in a hunter- killer role on the mid-Atlantic route, the Royal Navy's experience was less positive. Winter gales made flying difficult and hazardous, while the need to provide protection to the carrier hampered A/S operations. 2 SG at least generally had more success operating without carrier assistance.Wemyss pp.98-99 On 2 December SG was acting in support of SL 140/MKS 31 with 4 SG (Cdr. E.H. Chavasse). 2 SG put in a determined attack on a U-boat, (thought to be naval-history.net : HMS Starling), but was unsuccessful, though the battle for SL 140/MKS 31 saw the destruction of a U-boat, without loss of ships.Roskill p.53 Six in one trip HMS Kite of the 2nd Escort Group conducting a depth charge attack. In January 1944 2 SG sailed on its most famous exploit, accounting for six U-boats in one patrol, three of them in one 15-hour period. On 31 January 1944 Walker's group gained their first kill of the year when they sank . On 9 February his group sank , , and in one action, then sank on 11 February, and on 19 February. This patrol was ended on 20 February 1944, when one of Walker's group, , was torpedoed (possibly by naval- history.net : HMS Woodpecker or by ).Blair p.500 After an 8-day struggle to get her home, Woodpecker sank in a gale off the Scillies; all of her crew were saved. Woodpecker was the only ship of 2 SG lost in action. The group returned to its base at Liverpool to the thrilled jubilation of the city's inhabitants and the Admiralty. The First Lord of the Admiralty was present to greet Walker and his ships. Walker's seniority as Captain was backdated from 30 Jun 42 to 30 Jun 40 and awarded a second Bar to his DSO. Arctic convoy In March 1944 the group returned to North Atlantic, destroying on weather patrol, before joining Arctic convoy JW 58. It was joined in this for a short period by . 2 SG met and destroyed in transit across the \\"Rosegarden\\", but had no other success, though three U-boats were destroyed in attacks on JW 58. The return convoy, RA 58, was also attacked but neither side saw any success. In May 1944, 2 SG responded to an attack on by . Though starting from 300 miles away Walker, in an inspired piece of work, divined where to search and after a three-day search gained contact. An 18-hour hunt brought U-473 to the surface, where she was sunk by gunfire. In June 1944, 2 SG was joined by , , and , replacements for Kite and Magpie. That month the group was on a search and destroy operations in the South-Western Approaches, as part of \\"Operation Neptune\\" - the invasion of Normandy, and was instrumental in preventing any attacks on the invasion fleet. In all fifteen U-boats were destroyed in attempts to attack the invasion fleet. Eight ships were sunk.Blair pp.581-592 On 2 July SG received its heaviest blow when Capt. Walker died suddenly of a cerebral haemorrhage. Later operations In July 1944, 2 SG was back in action, led initially by Dominica (Cdr. N.A. Duck) and later by Wild Goose (Cdr. D.E.G. Wemyss). The group had one successful patrol during August operating in the Bay of Biscay. Four U-boats, , , , and were accounted for while attempting to cross the bay to and from their bases. The months following this were unfruitful, however, as the U-boat Arm changed its tactics to operate in the shallow inland waters around Britain, using the schnorkel to remain submerged for entire patrols. This created a different set of tactical problems, requiring different tactics of the escorts. Last successes In 1945 Loch Fada and Loch Killin were transferred, to be replaced by , , and . As 2 SG grappled with the changed nature of the campaign the group saw its last successes. In February 1945 the group destroyed two more U-boats, and Wemyss p.172(some sources say this was ).Neistle p.? 2 SG was also credited with , bringing its score to 23. Wemyss reports the attack, in March 1945, but after a report of another sinking in the same area six months earlier, concluded they were \\"flogging a dead horse\\".Wemyss p.148 However a post-war report of U-683 missing in the area led to 2 SG being credited with her destruction. More recent analysis has questioned this, and the assessment was changed in 1989. It is now thought that 2 SG's attack was on the wreck of , sunk in September 1944.Neistle pp.82, 232 Despite this, 2nd Support Group was responsible for the confirmed destruction of 22 U-boats during World War II, making it the most successful anti-submarine unit of the entire conflict.

He founded several other movements and religious congregations that would address a range of social and ethical issues. These issues included anti-alcoholism and human rights. His movements first came about after starting out as simple retreats designed for both altar servers and families that later began to address a series of issues in Poland at the time. His concern for human rights came during the communist era in Poland as well as his experiences as a prisoner of war during World War II in which he was incarcerated in Auschwitz and other concentration camps under the German Nazi regime. Blachnicki's beatification process opened in Poland in the 1990s and he became titled as a Servant of God upon the cause's commencement. The decisive moment in the process came on 30 September 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and titled him as Venerable. Life Franciszek Blachnicki was born on 24 March 1921 in Upper Silesia (then Germany) as the seventh-born child to J√≥zef Blachnicki and Maria Miller. He had at least one brother. He finished school in 1938. In September 1939 he participated in the campaign to fight against the invading German armed forces at the outbreak of World War II. But his involvement in this campaign led to the Gestapo arresting him on 24 June 1940 that saw an investigation and Blachnicki thrown into the notorious German Auschwitz concentration camp as prisoner 1201. He was later transferred on 19 September 1941 to a prison in Zabrze and later to Katowice where a further investigation into the charges against him was launched. On 30 March 1942 he was sentenced to death for having conspired against the Nazi regime and was scheduled to be beheaded at the guillotine. But something profound happened to him in his cell on 17 June 1942: he experienced a sudden conversion of faith in God in which he felt closer to Him and decided to dedicate his life to Him. But on 14 August 1942 he was pardoned and his death sentence was changed to a decade in prison which would take effect whenever the war ended. However this never happened since on 17 April 1945 he and the entire Lengenfeld camp were liberated after the arrival of United States soldiers. Blachnicki decided then to pursue the priesthood and so made an application on 6 August 1945 to commence his ecclesial education in Krak√≥w. He obtained good results during this period from 1945 to 1950 and was interested in catechetics and liturgics. He received his solemn ordination to the priesthood on 25 June 1950 in the Saints Peter and Paul church in Katowice from Bishop Stanis≈Çaw Adamski. In 1951 he held a retreat for altar servers at Lubliniec and created the first retreat for children around that time. But a retreat for children from 10-14 August 1952 for the first time used the name \\"Oasis for the Children of God\\". The first such retreat under this name for altar servers would be held in Bibiela in 1954. The communist crackdown on religion saw Silesian bishops ejected from the diocese Blachnicki was in from 1952 until 1956. This prompted him to work for a secret underground diocesan curia which put him into conflict with the diocese's vicar capitular Jan Piskorz. On 8 September 1957 he began a national anti-smoking and anti- drinking campaign that was later named as the \\"Crusade of Temperance\\" on 10 August 1958; this work encouraged abstinence which could be offered to God as expiation for those addicted to drinking. But this campaign put him into direct conflict with the communist authorities who continued to harass him for this. On August 29 1960 the campaign's offices were raided and Blachnicki was arrested and charged with having conducted illegal activities. He was given a ten month jail term which was suspended for three sometime later. In summer 1961 the Katowice curia allowed for him to enter the college in Lublin for further theological studies. He began his time there in October 1961 and taught there from 1964 to 1972 during which time he published about 100 works. In 1976 he founded the Lumi√®re et Vie movement. The retreats that he led would later transform into the Light-Life movement which had also become known as the Oasis Movement. He had based the movement on the renewal of the Second Vatican Council while taking inspiration from the document Gaudium et Spes. He also founded a religious congregation of nuns in the late 1950s. The first retreat for families was prepared in 1973 and this began the development of the Domestic Church branch of the movement. Blachnicki left for Rome on 10 December 1981 to help the Servant of God Luigi Giussani work on the Congress of the Renewal Movements but could not return to Poland due to the imposition of martial law. This forced him to settle in Carlsberg where he settled in the Polish center known as \\"Marianum\\". In 1980 he founded the Union of Priests of Christ Servant and on 17 June 1982 founded the Christian Service of the Liberation of Nations to support human rights and encourage Christian activism. Blachnicki's sudden death in 1984 was ruled as an embolism. Pope John Paul II sent an official telegram of condolence upon learning of Blachnicki's death and in it referred to Blachnicki as \\"an ardent apostle of inner renewal and conversion\\". The pope further praised him for his insight into social and ethical issues and for his \\"specific charisma\\". In 1994 he was granted the posthumous award of the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and in 1995 was granted the posthumous award of the Auschwitz Cross Medal. On 1 April 2000 his remains were relocated to the church of the Good Shepherd in Kro≈õcienko. From 2001-05 an investigation was launched into his death with investigators concluding that it was possible - though no actual proof was submitted - that communist authorities poisoned him. Beatification process The beatification process opened on 21 April 1995 and Blachnicki became titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" edict that allowed for the cause to be launched. The diocesan process was inaugurated in Katowice on 9 December 1995 and was closed on 25 November 2001 at which point the C.C.S. validated the process on 29 November 2002 in Rome. The postulation later compiled the Positio dossier which detailed his life and reputation for holiness; this dossier was submitted to officials in the C.C.S. on 27 February 2013. Theologians approved the cause on 16 October 2014 while the C.C.S. members confirmed the cause later on 22 September 2015. The decisive moment for the process came on 30 September 2015 after he was named as Venerable after Pope Francis recognized that Blachnicki had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is Bishop Adam Wodarczyk.

Last Daytona 500 starts for Darel Dieringer, Clyde Lynn, Sam McQuagg, Mario Andretti, Sonny Hutchins, Bob Cooper, Jerry Grant, Paul Lewis, Roy Tyner, and H. B. Bailey. This was the race in which Junior Johnson cost his own team the race. Cale ran out of gas at some point in the race and overshot his pit as the crew wasn't expecting him. Junior Johnson was standing out waiting for Leeroy to come and he managed to put just enough gas to get Cale back around to his put. Al Unser led a lap in this one; it became the only time that he led a NASCAR race in his career. Dub Simpson earned a dubious distinction by becoming the only driver ever to fail to complete a lap in the race. This was also Bob \\"The Sneaker\\" Senneker's best career NASCAR finish, where he finished in 13th place. Richard Petty and his \\"mysterious\\" black vinyl roof actually ran pretty good and led the race until James Hylton blew a tire and ended up in the turn 1 wall. A piece of debris from Hylton's car hit Petty's and knocked the roof loose starting a day of troubles for Richard's team because of their experiment. Petty would finish the race two laps behind the drivers on the lead lap. The transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade. Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the \\"strictly stock\\" vehicles of the 1950s.

David Dee of St Mary Hall, Oxford, who held the rectory of St Bartholomew-the-Great, West Smithfield from 1587 to 1605, when he was deprived. Francis Dee was born in London, and was admitted a scholar of Merchant Taylors' School on 26 April 1591. He proceeded to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1595 and became scholar on the Billingsley foundation in 1596. He took his degree of M.A. in 1603, B.D. in 1610, and D.D. in 1617. In 1606, the year after his father's deprivation, he was appointed to the rectory of Holy Trinity the Less in the city of London, which he resigned in 1620. In 1615 he became rector of Allhallows, Lombard Street, and held the benefice with his other preferments till his elevation to the episcopate. In 1619 he received the chancellorship of Salisbury Cathedral. In 1629 he seems to have been chaplain to the English ambassador in Paris; he forwarded to William Laud a petition from a John Fincham, in France on the king's service and imprisoned in the Bastille. In 1630 he was one of the assistants in the foundation of Sion College. He became Dean of Chichester 30 April 1630. He was consecrated bishop of Peterborough at Lambeth by Archbishop Laud, assisted by William Juxon, on 18 May 1634, and was enthroned by proxy on 28 May. In his diocese, as elsewhere, the order for placing the communion table altarwise at the east end of the chancel, and fencing it in with rails, produced discontent among the clergy, and Dee received frequent instructions from the high court of commission to proceed against those who refused obedience. Dee died at Peterborough on 8 October 1638 and was buried in his cathedral. By his will, dated 28 May 1638, he gave to the repair of his cathedral, and to St. John's College the impropriate rectory of Pagham for the foundation of two scholars and two fellows to be chosen from Peterborough grammar school. He also bequeathed to the college works in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and his chapel plate. He was twice married: first to Susan le Poreque, and secondly to Elizabeth, daughter of John Winter, canon of Canterbury, by whom he left an only daughter, who married Brian King, canon of Chichester. He preached before the court in praise of virginity, which was considered tactless.Hugh Trevor- Roper, Archbishop Laud (2000), p. 148.

Like other literary annuals, The Keepsake was an anthology of short fiction, poetry, essays, and engraved illustrations. It was a gift book designed to appeal to young women, and was distinctive for its binding of scarlet dress silk and the quality of its illustrations. Although the literature in The Keepsake and other annuals is often regarded as second- rate, many of the contributors to The Keepsake are canonical authors of the Romantic period.  Publication history  William Miller after R. P. Bonington, published in The Keepsake for MDCCCXXXI (1831) The first edition of The Keepsake was initiated by the engraver Charles Heath, who initially approached the publisher John Murray but entered an agreement with another publisher, Hurst, Chance, and Co., to publish the first volume.  Editors  William Harrison Ainsworth edited The Keepsake for 1828. Frederic Mansel Reynolds (c. 1800 to 1850) took over the editorship for the 1829 to 1835 volumes and again for 1838 and 1839. Caroline Norton edited The Keepsake for 1836, followed by Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley for the 1837 and 1840 volumes. Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington, edited The Keepsake for 1841 to 1849. She was succeeded by Marguerite Agnes Power, who edited the annual from 1850 to the final volume in 1857.  Publishers  The Keepsake was published in London for its full run, and some volumes were also published in Paris, Berlin, and Frankfurt. Its London publishers were Hurst, Chance, & Co.; Jennings and Chaplin; Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman (in the Longman line); and David Bogue. In Paris, it was published by Rittner and Goupill, Delloy & Co., Fisher & Co., Aubert & Co., L. Curmer, Fisher, Son, & Co., and H. Mandeville. Other continental editions were published by Charles Jugil in Frankfurt, A. Asher in Berlin, and T. O. Weigel in Leipsic. American editions of The Keepsake were published in New York by D. Appleton & Company and in Philadelphia by Lea and Blanchard.  Production  The intensely competitive market for gift books drove innovations in book production. The Keepsake's high-quality illustrations were created with steel plates, which were more durable than the copper plates that were more commonly used in the 1830s, and therefore could produce larger editions before being replaced. These illustrations were often commissioned before the short stories, poems, or essays that they were to accompany.Feldman 2006, p. 20.  Contributors  The Keepsake for 1829 is particularly notable for its contributors, which included the most popular authors and artists of the day, many of whose works now comprise the Romantic literary canon. Well known contributors to this volume include Mary Shelley, Thomas Moore, Walter Scott, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Felicia Hemans, and Robert Southey. \\"Contents\\". The editors of The Keepsake offered generous compensation to its authors, but many were hesitant to publish their work in The Keepsake or other annuals because these publications were not well respected by critics.

The names of the contributors were not listed, but they included Felicia Hemans, Percy Shelley, and Ainsworth himself.Feldman 2006.

The merger Rushden & Diamonds were formed on 21 April 1992 by a merger of Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds. The merger was the brainchild of Max Griggs, the owner of Dr. Martens. The new club took Rushden Town's place in the Midland Division of the Southern League, but played at Irthlingborough's Nene Park as Rushden's Hayden Road was not good enough for promotion (they had been demoted from the Premier Division the previous season due to the state of their ground). The first match was at home to Bilston Town in front of 315 fans and finished 2-2.http://rdfc1992.com/rushden-diamonds-match-history/ The early years (1992‚Äì1996) The club's first few seasons were remarkable for the success the team enjoyed. In the first campaign as a new club under the stewardship of Roger Ashby (1992/93), the Diamonds finished 3rd in the Southern League Midland Division. The following season, before which a new 1,000 all-seater North Stand was opened, the club won the league, securing promotion to the Southern League Premier Division on the final day, after a nervy 3‚Äì2 win over Merthyr Tydfil ahead of 4,664. This promotion coincided with another big improvement at Nene Park, with the Diamond Centre and dressing rooms completing the South Stand development, while the construction of the 1,800 capacity Peter De Banke Terrace was also well under way.Ten of Diamonds by Tony Jones, p43 The 1994/95 campaign was dominated by a superb run in the FA Trophy, as the club managed to reach the Semi-Final stage and a two-legged tie against Woking. Diamonds won the home leg 1‚Äì0, but suffered a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Kingfield days later to succumb 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. Again, it only took two years for the Diamonds to again be promoted as champions, by the small margin of two points over Halesowen Town in 1996. The team had gained promotion to the Football Conference after just four years as a club. With only the east end of the ground undeveloped, the stunning 2,372 seat AirWair Stand was completed, opening in December 1996 to augment the stadium's capacity to 6,572. The struggle to reach the Football League Upon promotion to the Football Conference for the 1996/97 season, Brian Talbot replaced Roger Ashby as First Team Coach in the March of that campaign with the club bottom of the table. Talbot had a dramatic effect and managed to steer the club to mid-table safety. He was eventually appointed club manager on a permanent basis before the 1999/00 campaign. The team spent five seasons in total attempting to reach the Football League, finishing 12th in 1996/97, and then 4th, 4th, 2nd behind champions Kidderminster Harriers, and 1st. The stadium development also continued at a frantic pace. In the summer of 1998 executive boxes were added to the back of the North Stand, with new offices and club shop to boot. That same June work began on a roof over the Airwair Stand which was in full use by November. The Diamonds had big success in the FA Cup within this period. In 1998/99, Forest Green, Leatherhead and Football League side Shrewsbury Town were all dispatched to set up a 2nd Round away clash with Doncaster Rovers. Both teams fought out a cagey goalless draw at Belle Vue to set up a replay at Nene Park, in which the home side triumphed 4‚Äì2 against 10-man Donny to progress. The reward was a dream tie at home to Leeds United. A record attendance of 6,431 witnessed a 0‚Äì0 draw as Rushden held their illustrious Premier League opponents to secure a replay in Yorkshire. Around 3,000 Diamonds fans made the trip up the M1 in a crowd of over 39,000 at Elland Road. Carl Heggs put Rushden into an 11th-minute lead. However, class told in the end and United eventually ran out 3-1 winners to halt Diamonds' superb Cup run.http://rdfc1992.com/1999/01/13/leeds-united-3-rushden-diamonds-1/ The following season the club yet again made it to the 3rd Round, receiving another plum draw, this time away to Sheffield United. Rushden put in a spirited display and a Jon Brady goal was enough to hold the Division One side to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Bramall Lane. In the replay the home side held their own against The Blades with the score 0-0 after 90 minutes. United went ahead in extra-time but Diamonds immediately levelled to force the dreaded penalties. At 5‚Äì5 in sudden death Brady had his kick saved, and Marcus Bent converted from the spot for United to knock the Conference side out. The championship- winning season in 2000/01 was Rushden's 8th top-six finish in their nine-year history. The club spent some serious money in pre-season in order to bolster their strike force, as they hoped to clinch the elusive Conference title at last. The huge sum of nearly ¬£300,000 was spent on new players, including Duane Darby, a ¬£100,000 purchase from Notts County and Justin Jackson from Morecambe, for whom ¬£180,000 was paid. Jackson's fee was an unprecedented amount of money paid between two non-league clubs.https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/diamonds- look-to-recapture-sparkle-637504.html The brand new Dr. Martens Sports and Exhibition Centre was opened in early summer, containing gymnasium, management offices and recreational facilities amongst other offerings. With promotion being an absolute must, a great start soon tailed off and Diamonds trailed Yeovil Town at Christmas time by a huge margin. However, despite some fans calling for Brian Talbot's head, Max Griggs' faith would be rewarded. A run of just one defeat from the remaining 23 matches saw the deficit clawed back. The club eventually finished six points ahead of their title rivals, securing promotion into Football League Division Three with a 2‚Äì1 win at Chester City.http://rdfc1992.com/2012/12/31/rushden-diamonds-football-club-history/ Football League 2001/02 After three near-misses Diamonds finally fulfilled their aim, and won promotion to the Football League as Conference champions in 2001. The first ever Football League match for Rushden & Diamonds ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory away to York City. Although the team achieved a 3‚Äì2 win at Burnley in the League Cup, they struggled to adapt to their new surroundings and went seven games without a victory. This was put right with a home success versus Cheltenham Town to kick start the campaign, subsequently leading to a 10-match unbeaten run which included four wins. In the LDV Vans Trophy a demolition job by Cardiff City resulted in a 7‚Äì1 thumping for Diamonds at Ninian Park, whilst a loss at Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup 1st Round put paid to any potential run. The club hit a mixed run of form on the approach to and during the Christmas period, though the signing of Onandi Lowe, a Jamaican international striker, proved to be a decisive acquisition. 2002 began with much improvement, as five wins from seven matches indicated a possible push for promotion. A 2‚Äì1 defeat to Hull City at Boothferry Park in early February was followed up by three draws and two wins, whilst Luton Town inflicted Rushden's first league defeat at Nene Park since September 2001 on 9 March. Diamonds found themselves in a great position for a top-seven finish and four emphatic wins in a row put them on the cusp of a Play-Off place. A draw at Scunthorpe United and a defeat at home to Kidderminster Harriers however meant a win was needed on the final day to assure qualification for the Play-Offs. This was duly delivered with a 4‚Äì2 victory away to Halifax Town, as the club finished in sixth spot to set up a Play-Off Semi-Final against Rochdale. In the first leg at Nene Park the away side twice took the lead, but both times Rushden equalised as the match finished 2-2. In a mouth- watering second leg at Spotland, an unfortunate own goal by Tarkan Mustafa on 63 minutes put the hosts on the front foot. But Diamonds immediately responded through Onandi Lowe, and with quarter of an hour to go Paul Hall went through on goal, rounded the keeper, and tucked home for a 2‚Äì1 lead (4-3 on aggregate). Rushden held on to secure a famous victory and progress to the Play-Off Final at the Millennium Stadium to play Cheltenham. Over 24,000 saw Martin Devaney put the Robins ahead, quickly cancelled out by a Paul Hall wonder goal. It wasn't to be though as two further goals secured the win for Cheltenham to end Diamonds' promotion hopes after a strong season. 2002/03 After going close the previous campaign, promotion was very high on the agenda as Diamonds looked to go one better in 2002/03. The new term began well with four wins, two draws and a defeat, whilst progress to the League Cup 2nd Round was made as Millwall were beaten at Nene Park 5‚Äì3 on penalties AET. Just 10 points were gained in the next eight league games, as the club hit an average run of form. Within this period Rushden suffered their heaviest ever defeat, with an 8‚Äì0 loss at the hands of Coventry City in the League Cup, as nine-man Diamonds were annihilated at Highfield Road. The LDV Vans Trophy was exited at the first hurdle with a 4‚Äì0 defeat away to Cambridge United. The club responded in style though with six straight league wins to get the promotion push well back on track. In the FA Cup 1st Round a 2‚Äì2 draw away to Kidderminster Harriers forced a replay, in which Diamonds won 2‚Äì1 to set up a trip to Exeter City in the next stage. A disappointing performance resulted in a 3‚Äì1 loss at St James Park, but one which meant they could now 'concentrate on the league'. Although Rushden finished the year in the top- six, their form slightly tailed off over Christmas and in January, with Oxford United completing a league double over the team as eight games yielded only 12 points. In February and early March Diamonds won two, drew two and lost two and were sitting in an automatic promotion place. The club went on a barnstorming run with victories against Hull, Bury, Exeter City, Bristol Rovers and Lincoln City, alongside draws with Boston United and Rochdale. Diamonds had therefore completely caught up with leaders Hartlepool United who had been choking. Rushden & Diamonds secured their promotion to Division Two at Carlisle United, with a 2‚Äì1 win at Brunton Park, a result which sent them top of the league. As their title rivals were held to a draw by Rochdale, a 3‚Äì0 win at home to Macclesfield Town meant a success at Leyton Orient would secure top spot. 1,240 Diamonds fans travelled to Brisbane Road in expectancy; however a 0‚Äì0 draw ensured a title showdown at Nene Park against Hartlepool on the final day. In front of a plus 6,200 crowd, and needing just a point, the home side went ahead in the first half through Paul Hall. As the game approached its conclusion a late Chris Westwood equaliser made for a nerve- racking finish. But Diamonds managed to hold on for the draw and thus seal the Division Three title in dramatic fashion by two points. The club had incredibly gone from the Southern League Midland Division to Division Two, the third tier of English football, in just 11 years. 2003/04 2003/04 was a difficult season for Rushden and Diamonds. The club's board and supporters were hopeful of another promotion challenge, and some promising results in the early part of the season suggested that this could be achieved. But a run of bad results during the winter saw the club slip down the table and in March 2004 Brian Talbot left the club after seven years as manager to take charge at Oldham Athletic. Barry Hunter, with no previous managerial experience, was appointed as the caretaker player-manager, but with the club needing to offload its top players to balance the books it continued to slide further down the Second Division table and they were relegated in 22nd place after losing their last game of the season. 2004/05 Ernie Tippett was appointed as for the last three games of the 2003/04 season and for the start of the 2004/05 season. Despite bringing in a large number of new players, after a dismal run of results which saw the team the media predicted as promotion contenders fall to 22nd place in League Two, he left the club by mutual consent in January 2005. Barry Hunter became caretaker manager again, and although there were many applicants for the position, he was appointed full-time manager towards the end of the season. The club staved off relegation at the expense of Cambridge United and Kidderminster Harriers, but released several players at the conclusion of the campaign. 2005/06 In Summer 2005, Max Griggs handed over the club and certain assets to a supporters' trust, along with an initial cash pledge. He gave ¬£750,000 to the newly founded supporters trust. \\"I feel very happy that I'm giving it to the right people\\", he said. The 2005/06 season itself saw the club perform towards the lower end of the table as expected by the media. Manager Hunter rebuilt the squad in the January transfer window, and at the same time sold youth team products Andy Burgess, David Bell, and John Dempster. However, the club continued to struggle and on 29 April, Rushden were relegated to the Conference after a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Boston United, which resulted in manager Barry Hunter being told his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. Conference 2006/07 Paul Hart took over as manager on 23 May and during the summer, Hart signed former Gillingham defender Chris Hope, Leo Fortune-West, Glenn Wilson, Paul Watson and Jon Ashton. However, following a poor run of results, Hart left by mutual consent in mid-October, with goalkeeping coach Tony Godden becoming caretaker manager. Mid- and late-2006 saw a lot of changes at the club. In July Helen Thompson became chairman, in November the club was taken over by former Peterborough United vice-chairman Keith Cousins and in December Graham Westley was appointed as manager, with the aim of getting the club out of the relegation battle and build towards promotion back into the Football League. After a seven-game unbeaten run, which featured five wins and two draws, Graham Westley was relieved of his duties on 24 February 2007 for unknown reasons. Two days later it was announced that former Weymouth manager Garry Hill would be Westley's replacement. Hill's first match, on Saturday 3 March, was a 3‚Äì0 win over Exeter City. After this game, the club hit an average run of form, eventually finishing 12th in the table. 2007/08 The club started 2007/08 with mixed fortunes, winning only five games in the opening eighteen,http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/Fixtures/0,,10784~2007,00.html and went into the Christmas break in 17th place. 12 points short of the play-off places and 26 points behind league leaders Aldershot. A mini-revival and an unbeaten run was enjoyed from 29 January to 12 March but that run was ended with a 2‚Äì1 loss versus Histon. The season ended with the club in 16th place. However, while the league campaign was disappointing, the Diamonds performed better in the cup competitions. They reached the 2nd round of the 2007‚Äì08 FA Cup with a 5‚Äì0 win over Solihull Moors and a 3‚Äì1 win over league side Macclesfield Town. However, despite an early goal from Marcus Kelly, a 45-yard strike that was nominated by Match of the Day's Alan Shearer as \\"goal of the day\\" the Diamonds lost their second round tie with Bristol Rovers 5‚Äì1, in poor conditions.http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10784~43199,00.html The club became runners up of the Conference League Cup losing out to Aldershot after a thrilling 3‚Äì3 draw resulted in a penalty shoot-out and the club were also knocked out of the FA Trophy in the Quarter-Finals. 2008/09 During the summer, Hill brought in a plethora of new faces; including former Lincoln City shot stopper Alan Marriott and former Cambridge midfielder Rob Wolleaston. Hill also brought to the club Dean McDonald, Lee Phillips, Sagi Burton, Jamie McGuiness, Gareth Jelleyman and Daryl Clare from Conference National rivals Burton Albion. Leon Knight was also later brought in, a major coup. On paper, and according to the bookies, Rushden were considered one of the best teams in the league, and were joint-favourites to win the Conference. However, despite the influx of new players, Garry Hill's side failed to perform. By the end of October the club were in 12th. After losing to Evesham in the FA Cup, on a day the official site described as \\"one of the darkest\\" in their historyhttp://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/MatchReport/0,,10784~46611,00.html eight players were transfer-listed, including four players brought in during the summer.http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10784~1436174,00.html In early December, Knight was sacked for breach of the club's code of conduct. Chairman Keith Cousins retained the option to keep Knight's registration rendering him unemployed from football, unless another club pays a transfer fee to the Diamonds. After nearly two years managing the club, manager Garry Hill resigned on Tuesday 10 February 2009 following a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Burton Albion, with Justin Edinburgh taking over as caretaker manager. It was announced later that day that goalkeeping coach and former caretaker manager Tony Godden also left the club by mutual consent. Edinburgh's first match in charge was a 9‚Äì0 victory over Weymouth F.C. after their opponents fielded their youth team after their first team left, after not being paid.http://www.twohundredpercent.net/?p=1216http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/7886474.stm Following Hill's resignation, the free management position was applied for by over 50 people, including ex-West Ham player Julian Dicks, as well as Rushden legends Duane Darby, Paul Hall and Paul Underwood. Justin Edinburgh, caretaker manager, was given the job until the end of the season. Within the space of a few games, Edinburgh breathed new life in the club as for the first time in years, the team began to play with an air of self-confidence and without fear. As well as a successful start to his RDFC managing career, (earning ten points from a possible fifteen in his first five games), the standard of play and the overall entertainment value rose dramatically, with several players rediscovering performances that some had not brought forth in years. A 1‚Äì0 win over rivals Kettering merely heightened this sense of relief and recovery. The season ended with a 3‚Äì1 win over already-relegated Woking FC. The result ensured their final position as 11th, their highest finish in a league table since the Division 3 title was won in 2003. The season also ended pleasantly with the knowledge that nearly 1,000 extra people had visited Nene Park that season for league games, seeing a rise in the average league attendance for the first time in years. 2009/10 The middle of 2009 saw Justin Edinburgh start the rebuilding of the squad. With only Curtis Osano as the only surviving player from last summers' squad numbers 1 to 11, and the addition of two loan signings from Nottingham Forest, the new look Rushden side did well in pre-season with a number of victories notably over MK Dons, Peterborough and Blackpool in the ERREA Cup. The season saw Rushden have an indifferent start. The club eventually picked up form however, and were well in the top ten for the majority of the season. Rushden reached the FA Cup Second Round, but lost away to Brighton 3‚Äì2 in November. The club finished in fourth place to make the Conference Play Offs. The first leg against Oxford United at Nene Park, ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw after a tight encounter, with Mark Byrne scoring for the Diamonds. In the return tie on May Day bank holiday however, a disappointing 2‚Äì0 defeat ensued for the Diamonds at the Kassam Stadium, to end their promotion chances. Within the 2009/2010 campaign, Rushden recorded their biggest ever home win 8‚Äì0 against Gateshead in front of 1,435 fans.http://www.thediamondsfc.com/page/Fixtures/0,,10784~2009,00.html 2010/11 The new campaign would prove to be a thoroughly turbulent one in many respects for the club, and one which would culminate in its demise. A largely solid start to the season ensued with 27 points amassed from the first 16 matches. Then, in the FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round, Diamonds were drawn away to their fierce local rivals Kettering Town. Early goals from Lewwis Spence and Rene Howe (penalty) put the away side in firm control. They were reduced to ten men before the hour mark and although Paul Furlong pulled one back for the Poppies just afterwards, Rushden held on to secure a place in the next round and the local bragging rights.http://rdfc1992.com/2010/10/23/kettering- town-1-rushden-diamonds-2/ In the First Round Proper, however, a controversial 1‚Äì0 defeat against Yeovil Town ended any further progress in the competition. On 1 December Chairman Keith Cousins stepped down from his role and was replaced by Liam Beasant and Gary Calder. But much worse news was to follow in the coming weeks. On 14 December, hours before the FA Trophy tie away at Eastwood Town, the club received the news that their goalkeeper Dale Roberts had died. This understandably rocked everyone connected with the club, with the coroner recording a verdict of suicide days later.http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/dale-was-so- depressed-1-3258869 Although the beginning of 2011 brought three straight defeats, the club recovered well and found itself in a strong league position come the end of February. However, the 1‚Äì1 home draw against Hayes & Yeading United at the start of March heralded a downturn in fortunes as the club's form deteriorated rapidly, with just two wins from the last thirteen matches as the club staggered to a 13th-placed finish.

The short stories were entitled \\"My Aunt Margaret's Mirror\\", \\"The Tapestried Chamber, or The Lady in the Sacque\\", and \\"Death of the Laird's Jock\\". Charles Heath had originally planned for Scott to become the editor of the annual, offering him ¬£800. Scott refused but accepted ¬£500 for these three stories, which had been intended for Scott's collection Chronicles of the Canongate, but had already been rejected by its editor Robert Cadell. The annual also included Scott's \\"Description of the Engraving Entitled A Scene at Abbotsford\\". My Aunt Margaret's Mirror Plot summary Sir Philip, who had married for money and quarrelled with his brother-in-law, determined on the declaration of war in 1702 to join the Duke of Marlborough's army in Flanders as a volunteer. Receiving no tidings of him for many months, Lady Jemima resolved to consult a doctor from Padua, who had the reputation of being able to show his visitors their absent friends, and what they were doing. Accordingly, she and her sister, disguised as soldiers' wives, went to him secretly, when he at once told them their real names and the information they desired. Having enjoined absolute silence, and changed his dress to that of an eastern necromancer, he led them into a room hung with black and lighted with torches, containing a large mirror behind an altar, on which were two swords, an open book, and a human skull. Gradually the mirror ceased to reflect these objects, and they saw the interior of a foreign church, in which Sir Philip was about to be married to a beautiful girl, when a group of officers entered, one of whom advanced towards the bridal party, arid swords were drawn on both sides. The scene then vanished, and the mirror again reflected the contents of the room. Restoratives were now offered to the ladies, and they were conducted to their carriage, the professor handing Lady Bothwell a composing draught for her sister. A few days afterwards news arrived from Holland that Sir Philip's nuptials with the daughter of a rich burgo-master were actually about to be celebrated, when Major Falconer, who happened to be in the town, and had come with some brother officers to witness the ceremony as an amusement, recognised and denounced the would-be bigamist, accepted a challenge from him, and was killed. Lady Jemima never recovered from the shock, the Italian disappeared to escape arrest as a Jacobite, and Sir Philip having, in his old age, sought in vain a reconciliation with Lady Bothwell, eluded pursuit as a murderer and died abroad. Basis The basis for the story above is thought to be the life of Eleanor, Countess of Stair who died in 1759. Characters * Sir Philip Forester * Lady Jemima, his wife * Lady Bothwell, his wife's sister * Major Falconer, their brother * Baptista Damiotti, a Paduan doctor The Tapestried Chamber Plot summary This is a ghost story. While travelling through the western counties, the general's attention was attracted by a picturesquely situated old castle, and, on inquiry at the inn where he changed horses, he learnt that its owner was a nobleman who had been his schoolfellow. He accordingly determined to call upon his lordship; and, having been persuaded to be his guest for a week, he was conducted at bedtime to an old-fashioned room, hung with tapestry, but comfortably furnished, and well lighted by two large candles and a blazing fire. The next morning Lord Woodville was informed by his servant that the general had been wandering in the park since an early hour and when he appeared at the breakfast table his countenance was haggard, his clothes carelessly put on, and his manner abstracted; moreover, he announced that he must depart immediately. Drawing him aside from the other visitors, his host pressed him for an explanation, and, after declaring that he would rather face a battery than recall the events of the night, he reluctantly narrated what he had undergone. Just as he was falling asleep he heard the rustling of a silk gown, and the tapping of high-heeled shoes, and then the figure of a woman passed between the bedstead and the fireplace. At first her back was towards him, but she slowly turned, and he distinctly saw the features of a corpse, bearing traces of the most hideous passions. He started up, and she sat on the bed, advancing her face within half a yard of his, upon which all his courage forsook him and he swooned. On recovering his senses she had disappeared, but he was afraid to move until daybreak, when he hurried from the room thoroughly unnerved. Lord Woodville was deeply impressed, for the chamber had the reputation of being haunted; and as he conducted the general through his picture gallery, he suddenly started as he caught sight of a portrait, exclaiming, \\"There she is!\\" and it proved to be the likeness of an ancestress whose crimes were incest and murder. Characters * General Browne, returned from the American war * The landlord of an inn * Lord Woodville, of Woodville Castle * The apparition of a woman Death of the Laird's Jock Plot summary Armstrong had been known during his father's lifetime as the Laird's Jock, or son; and being possessed of great strength and courage, had distinguished himself in the use of a two-handed sword, bequeathed to him by a Saxon outlaw, in many of the single combats which took place between the English and Scottish borderers during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He had, however, grown old, and was bed- ridden, when his only son accepted the challenge of an English champion. But his heart swelled with joy at the news, and having entrusted the lad with his celebrated weapon, he insisted on being wrapped in plaids and carried to the spot selected for the encounter, attended by his daughter. His followers gazed sadly on their chieftain's withered features and shrunken form; but when the combatants met, and the Englishman brandished the sword over his fallen antagonist, the old laird, reanimated for an instant with his former vigour, sprang from the rock on which he was seated, and, having uttered a cry like that of a dying lion rather than a human being, sank into the arms of his clansmen broken-hearted, not at the death of his boy, but at their wounded honour, and the irreparable loss of his weapon.

Similar to Xevious, the player's starship has two modes of fire: one to tackle flying enemies and one for ground-based ones. Starship Hector is a follow-up to Hudson Soft's earlier shooter Star Soldier, itself inspired by Tecmo's Star Force, an arcade game that Hudson had ported to the Famicom in 1985. The main background music of Starship Hector was reused as background music in Super Star Soldier. The theme also appears in the Wii title Kororinpa, which itself has many themes from older Hudson Soft games. The game was also ported in 1995 to the Super Famicom with Star Force and Star Soldier as part of a trilogy compilation titled the Caravan Shooting Collection released exclusively in Japan.

It was built by Thomas Baldwin and John Eveleigh between 1788 and 1794. Numbers 4, 5 and 6 are combined with Numbers 1 to 7 Great Pulteney Street, and others with Henrietta Street. History The fountain at the center of the quadrangle was not part of the original plan; it was added in the late 19th century. After completion of the main street in 1877 local residents petitioned and successfully raised significant funds to build a grand column (rather like Nelson's Column in London). However, as construction of the column started, the residents realised that the addition would tower over the area (it would be 50% taller than the houses), and so they then petitioned for it to be cancelled. After some negotiations, the column was pulled down and the much smaller fountain added instead. It consists of a circular stone basin with four radial projections surmounted by an urn with gadrooned bowl.
