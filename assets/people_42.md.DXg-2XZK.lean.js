He made aliya and moved to Israel with his family at age 13, in 2002. His family lived in an immigrant absorption center in Beersheba, while he went to a boarding school near Hadera. He served as a technical quartermaster in the Israel Defense Forces. After the army, he worked as a waiter in a cafe, and as a mover. He then became a sports teacher at a school in Netanya, Israel, where he now lives. Running career He ran for the club Hapoel Emek Hefer, won Under-16 regional and national competitions at middle distances, and at the age of 16 won the Israeli cross country youth championship. His mother initially did not want him to compete in running, as she felt it was a difficult sport and she thought he would be too skinny. In 2012, he signed up for physical education studies at the Wingate Institute in Netanya, and trained with Israeli Olympic marathon runner Zohar Zimro. In December 2015 he came in third with a time of 67:04 in the Israeli championships in the half marathon in Beit She'an, behind Marhu Teferi and Berihun Weve. He began to consider running a marathon for the first time, saying \\"I felt that if I did 21 kilometers in 1:07, I had the second half in my legs. Your gut tells you that you can do it. Go for it. I had faith and courage; it came from the heart.\\" Guadie completed his first marathon run, at the Rotterdam Marathon in the Netherlands in April 2016, in a time of 2:18:51. He came in 27th. His time was the second-best for an Israeli running his first marathon, after Tesama Moogas.\\" He reflected, \\"This marathon taught me two things: Ability and courage. To believe in yourself and not be afraid, to go for broke, to turn the impossible into the possible.\\" With his time in the Rotterdam Marathon, which was nine seconds better than the Olympic qualification standard, he qualified for the 2016 Olympics. He competed for Israel at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the marathon, and finished 122nd with a time of 2:30:45.[2:30:45] At the Seville Marathon in Spain in February 2020, he set his personal best with a time of 2:12:06.

It was released in 1997 via the Beautiful Music Company and Warner Special Products. The album was co-produced by Bobby Wood, Jay Patten, and Gayle. Joy and Inspiration would become her second album consisting of gospel music and would eventually be re-released and re-titled in 2008 under the name \\"He is Beautiful\\".  Background and content  Joy and Inspiration draws on elements taken not only from gospel, but also from country and pop music. Gayle was inspired to record another album of gospel music because it brought back memories of her childhood. She often spent her early years singing inspirational songs with her mother and family. In 1997, Gayle discussed her reasoning behind the development of the recording, > \\"We never thought we were poor even though we had hard times. Mom always > said, 'Keep God in your heart and you will always be the richest folks on > Earth.' I draw my inspiration not only from God but from my special family > and friends.\\" Joy & Inspiration originally contained twenty tracks of material. The twelfth track \\"Someday\\" had been previously issued on Gayle's 1995 studio album of the same name. The album included cover versions of popular gospel and inspirational songs. This included the tracks \\"Put Your Hand in the Hand\\", \\"One Day at a Time\\", and \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\". \\"He Is Beautiful to Me\\" was originally recorded by Gayle in 1982 for the studio album, True Love. The song was re-recorded for this album.  Critical reception and release  Joy & Inspiration mainly received positive responses from music critics and journalists. Jim Allen of Allmusic praised Gayle's vocal effects and musical styles, \\"Crystal Gayle gained pop/country crossover stardom in the '70s with hits like ‚ÄúDon't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,‚Äù but like so many great country artists, she had a strong gospel side to her musical personality. That spiritual side was expressed in the 1997 album HE IS BEAUTIFUL, where Gayle brought her sweet, supple vocal style to a batch of faith-based tunes. The music touches on pop, country, and gospel simultaneously, but the purity of intent is always there.\\" Joy & Inspiration was first released in 1997 and distributed as an audio cassette. In its initial issue, the album was released by both the Beautiful Music Company and Warner Special Products, a subsidiary of the larger Warner Bros. Records. It was re-issued as a compact disc on September 9, 2008 and was re-titled under the name He Is Beautiful. In this format, the album was released under the Demon Music Group.

History In the mid-1960s, Charles Dolan built a cable system called Sterling Manhattan Cable in the borough of Manhattan and launched Home Box Office (HBO)., The museum of broadcast communications He ended up selling both the cable system and HBO to Time Life Inc. He used the money to start a new cable system in suburban Long Island called CableVision. Cablevision, having changed its name from CableVision, quickly expanded by building on Long Island and acquiring smaller cable systems from other providers. Cablevision also built systems throughout the New York metro area: some of the other boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, Westchester County, and Connecticut. In the 1980s, Cablevision also expanded into the Chicago, Boston, and Cleveland areas. By the mid-1990s Cablevision would offer service to 2.9 million subscribers in 19 states. Through a series of transactions in the late 1990s, Cablevision decided to consolidate their cable systems into three core areas: New York, Cleveland, and Boston. Despite reducing the number of areas served they were able to bring the number of subscribers to 3.5 million through these transactions. One major transaction made at this time was with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI). Cablevision gained 10 New York area cable systems from TCI and in exchange TCI gained 33% ownership in the company. In 1999, AT&T; Corporation took over TCI thus giving them the one- third ownership in Cablevision., Cablevision Systems Corp Cooperate History In 2000, Cablevision sold-off its remaining systems outside the New York area in Boston, Cleveland, and Kalamazoo, Michigan to MediaOne, Adelphia, and Charter Communications respectively. As part of the deal, Cablevision traded its Boston area systems for MediaOne's Hudson Valley systems. AT&T; sold its share of Cablevision in 2001. On June 13, 2010, Cablevision announced that it would acquire Bresnan Communications for $1.37 billion. Bresnan provided service to about 308,000 cable subscribers in Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. This is the first time in a decade that Cablevision has owned systems outside the New York area (although Bresnan, like Cablevision, had its headquarters in the New York City suburbs). In May 2011, Cablevision rebranded the Bresnan systems as Optimum West. On February 8, 2013, Cablevision reached an agreement to sell its Optimum West systems to Charter Communications for US$1.63 billion. On November 23, 2013, Cablevision laid off 400 employees. On September 17, 2015, it was announced that Patrick Drahi's European telecom conglomerate Altice would acquire Cablevision for $17.7 billion, including debt, pending regulatory approval. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 3, 2016 and after approval from various regional regulators such as New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities and the New York Public Service Commission, closed on June 21, 2016. Under the terms of the deal, Altice paid $34.90 in cash for each share in Cablevision and a 22% premium to the company's stock price; Altice also assumed Cablevision's debt. The former assets of Cablevision operate as Altice USA. =Role in the West Side Stadium debate= In 2004 and 2005, Cablevision provided funding for an advertising campaign against the proposed construction of a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan supported by the Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg. The stadium would have principally served the New York Jets, and was an essential part of New York City's failed bid for the 2012 Olympics. Cablevision had offered a competitive bid that far exceeded the bid of the Jets for property owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where the new stadium would have been located. The plans to build the stadium were abandoned in June 2005 when the New York State Assembly under the leadership of Speaker Sheldon Silver refused to provide state subsidies for the project. = Philanthropy = In 1998, Cablevision helped found The Lustgarten Foundation, which has become the largest private foundation dedicated solely to funding pancreatic cancer research in America. The foundation was named after former Cablevision chairman Marc Lustgarten and has raised over $16 million. Cablevision currently underwrites the foundation, covering all administrative and fundraising costs, allowing 100% of all donations to go directly to research programs and grants to help cure pancreatic cancer, as well as sponsoring dozens of walks/runs across the country. The foundation is a 4-star charity on Charity Navigator, ranking at this level for its organizational and financial transparency, low administrative costs, board, and growth. The Madison Square Garden Company In 1994, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western), the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT would sell its share to Cablevision three years later. On February 9, 2010 Cablevision spun off its subsidiary Madison Square Garden, L.P. into a new company named The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG). Although a separate company, it was run by the Cablevision CEO, James Dolan. He remained an important figure in both companies until Cablevision's sale in 2016, and continues to head MSG. The company has three divisions consisting of professional sports teams, two regional sports networks, and several entertainment venues. MSG controls its namesake Madison Square Garden arena in New York City, and the professional sports teams that play there: the New York Knicks, and New York Rangers. The same company also owns the Hartford Wolf Pack, a minor-league professional hockey team affiliated with the Rangers. MSG also holds the TV rights for the Knicks, Rangers, Liberty, New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils, Buffalo Sabres and New York Red Bulls through their cable channels MSG Network, MSG Plus (formerly FSN New York), and MSG Western New York. Cablevision previously had the rights to the New York Yankees, New Jersey Nets and New York Mets, who left to start their own channels. Cablevision also previously attempted to purchase the Yankees, Mets and Boston Red Sox, in part, to control their broadcast rights. Other properties that are owned by MSG include the Beacon Theater, The Theatre at Madison Square Garden (formerly known as Felt Forum, Paramount and WaMu Theatre), and a long-term lease to operate Radio City Music Hall. Cable Networks =AMC Networks= On July 1, 2011, Cablevision spun off its subsidiary, formerly known as Rainbow Media LLC, into a new company named AMC Networks. AMC Networks owns several national cable networks including AMC, IFC, Sundance Channel, and WE tv. Wedding Central, a cable channel that was launched as a spin-off of WE tv in 2009, was also run by Rainbow Media. However, upon AMC Networks achieving its independence of Cablevision, the channel was shut down due to low ratings.AMC Networks Divorces Wedding Central Multichannel News July 8, 2011 Rainbow Media also controlled Fuse TV until 2010, when ownership was transferred to Cablevision's Madison Square Garden division, now operating independently as The Madison Square Garden Company (see above). The Rainbow Media subsidiary of Cablevision also operated a satellite television company called Voom, which was shut down on April 30, 2005, but lived on as a series of high-definition television channels named Voom HD Networks. They were available on Cablevision and iO digital cable until January 21, 2009. However, the 15 U.S. channels were eventually also shut down due to lack of distribution prior to the spinning off of Rainbow Media from Cablevision as the independent AMC Networks.VOOM going off the air....CV to replace all 15 channels, Cable Rant, January 21, 2009 =SportsChannel= Cablevision also owned the former SportsChannel America from its beginning in 1976 until it was dissolved into Fox Sports Net in the late 1990s. In 2007 Cablevision sold its control of FSN Bay Area and FSN New England to Comcast for $570 million.Comcast, Cablevision in deal on 2 sports networks, Yahoo!, April 30, 2007 These were the last of their regional sports networks outside the New York area. Other properties Cablevision acquired the New York-area electronics chain The Wiz in 1998. The chain was closed in 2003. Since then the name was sold to P. C. Richard & Son and currently remains as a dormant subsidiary of the company only showing Wiz Deals on some P.C. Richard items. From 1998 until April 29, 2013, Cablevision owned New York-area cinema chain Clearview Cinemas. It was sold to Bow Tie Cinemas of Connecticut. On July 29, 2008, Cablevision acquired Newsday and amNewYork in a deal worth $650m.Cablevision announces deal to buy Newsday , Newsday, May 12, 2008Cablevision Completes Newsday Buy from Tribune, Broadcasting and Cable, July 29, 2008 The Dolan family still maintains majority ownership of Newsday, with Altice USA having a 25% share. Carriage disputes =MSG Network= From September 1988 through July 1989, Cablevision did not carry MSG Network (at the time owned by Gulf+Western, which later became Paramount Communications) over the question of whether MSG should be offered as a basic service or a premium service. This move also occurred as New York Yankees games on cable moved to MSG from Cablevision-owned SportsChannel. The Cablevision position was that those who wished to pay for sports programming should shoulder the burden, not every consumer. This dispute ended with Cablevision offering MSG as a premium subscription service. =YES Network= Cablevision did not carry most of the games of the New York Yankees in 2002, because they would not accept the price asked during the inaugural season of YES Network. Again, at the root of the argument was who was to pay for sports programming. Cablevision wanted to offer YES as a premium service, like MSG and Fox Sports NY, where YES ownership wanted the channel on the 'Family Cable' tier. After a long standoff, a deal was made the following year. As a result, YES, along with MSG and Fox Sports NY, moved to the 'Family Cable' Tier. =NFL Network= Until 2012, Cablevision never carried the NFL Network, as the company stated that it would like to be able to carry NFL Sunday Ticket (which is, by contract, exclusive to DirecTV until the completion of the 2022 season) before it carries NFL Network. This has been criticized by New Jersey legislators.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i8b4e2c24bf2df48e5601a0466f77a42f Recently however, Cablevision purchased Bresnan Communications, a company headquartered in Purchase, New York, but which did all of its business in the Rocky Mountain region. Because of this, the NFL Network is carried on the former Bresnan (now Optimum West) systems, but not on Optimum systems in Greater New York. Finally, on August 16, 2012, Cablevision announced that they have reached an agreement with the NFL to carry the network on all its systems effective August 17. =Tennis Channel= Cablevision also carried the Tennis Channel for a brief period of time from October 2009-September 2011. Cablevision joined the NCTC in August 2009 just to carry the Tennis Channel on the premium sports package which costs extra per month. By joining NCTC the Tennis Channel was forced to give its signal to Cablevision. Once the Tennis Channel's contract expired with NCTC on September 3, 2011 the Tennis Channel pulled its signal from all cable carriers unwilling to negotiate a new deal or carry the channel more widespread. The Tennis Channel was pulled from Verizon but returned on January 17, 2012. Cablevision has yet to make any attempt at bringing the Tennis Channel back as of June 2012. =ESPN3 and WatchESPN= Cablevision never carried ESPN360.com, rebranded as ESPN3.com, a broadband service of ESPN. Also, Cablevision had yet to carry and give customers access to WatchESPN which is an app that allows customers to watch ESPN Networks when they are not at home. ESPN requires users to give what cable provider they subscribe to in order to watch and Cablevision had yet to agree to carry WatchESPN. On October 4, 2012, ESPN and Cablevision announced a comprehensive distribution and carriage agreement which included access for Cablevision customers to ESPN3 and WatchESPN in addition to other Watch apps covering the Walt Disney Company's family of networks. On November 19, Cablevision announced that ESPN3 was available to Optimum Online Customers. A month later on December 19, WatchESPN was released to Optimum TV Customers. =Verizon FiOS= Cablevision, as a content provider, also engaged in a dispute with Verizon over the carriage of MSG Network and Fox Sports Net New York on its FiOS television systems. Verizon sued Cablevision, claiming that Cablevision, which still owned MSG Network along with all Madison Square Garden-related properties at the time, did not want to make their valuable local sports coverage of both the NHL's New York Rangers and NBA's New York Knicks available to an emerging competitor to their cable systems. An agreement was reached in November 2006 allowing FiOS to carry these channels. However, MSG's programming was restricted to standard-definition on FiOS systems until the 2011-12 NHL and NBA seasons, when a court order forced Cablevision to provide Verizon with the HD feeds to both NY Rangers and NY Knicks programming. MSG additionally preferred Optimum over Verizon as a sponsor both on the TV Network and inside Madison Square Garden itself. Additionally, Cablevision owned exclusive rights to the MSNBC news network in its service territory, preventing its carriage by FiOS in overlapping areas. However, this exclusivity ended in February 2010. =2010 carriage disputes= January 2010: Food Network and HGTV dispute Because it was unable to reach a deal with Scripps Networks Interactive concerning retransmission fees, Scripps Networks Interactive revoked Cablevision's rights to carry the disputed channels, HGTV and the Food Network, on January 1, 2010. Cablevision issued a statement saying, \\"We wish Scripps well and have no expectation of carrying their programming again, given the dramatic changes in their approach to working with distributors to reach television viewers.\\" While the channels were affected, Cablevision ran commercials advertising their point of view and set up an area on their website to send out messages to Scripps Networks to tell them to re-carry Food Network and Home & Garden Television. Cablevision also looped a public service announcement on each affected channel and forced all of its customers' set-top boxes to channel 1999, which looped the same announcement. Cablevision and Scripps reached an agreement, and as of January 21, 2010, the two networks were back on Cablevision systems. The details of the agreement have not been disclosed.  March 2010: ABC contract dispute affecting WABC-TV and WPVI  On March 2, 2010, WABC-TV in New York along with Philadelphia sister station WPVI (carried in Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties) stated that they would pull their programming from Cablevision on March 7, 2010 (at midnight), unless a new payment structure is implemented for its network programming. Cablevision responded by citing WABC-TV and WPVI's free, over-the-air accessibility. Cablevision spokesman Charles Scheuler stated \\"It is not fair for ABC-Disney to hold Cablevision customers hostage by forcing them to pay what amounts to a new TV tax.\\" The removal of both stations occurred on the weekend of the 82nd Academy Awards, which was scheduled to be one of ABC's largest yearly specials, and was projected to cause a devastating blow to advertisers for the Oscars and to Cablevision itself. On Sunday March 7, 2010 at 12:01 am ET, both WABC and WPVI were removed from Cablevision leaving a black screen in their place, confirming the rumors that if a deal with Cablevision and ABC was not reached by midnight, the network and other Disney-owned channels would go off the air. Cablevision began looping a public service announcement on each affected channel and forcing all of its customers' set-top boxes to channel 1999, which was looping the same announcement, much like was done when Scripps Networks pulled their cable channels' programming. Besides providing certain details of the disagreement they stated that ABC shows could be watched online through TV websites such as Hulu. Also that day, Cablevision announced through e-mail that their entire film catalog of on-demand movies would be available without charge until midnight that evening as an apology to their customers. At 8:50 pm that day, WABC and WPVI returned to Cablevision's programming, after a notification during the 82nd Academy Awards announced progression in \\"Work to complete our negotiations\\", and the return of ABC's programming during the negotiations. October 2010: FOX and MyNetworkTV dispute affecting WNYW-TV, WWOR-TV and WTXF-TV Cablevision's contract with News Corp to carry FOX (including MyNetwork TV) expired on October 15, 2010. The contract includes WNYW and WWOR-TV in New York and WTXF in Philadelphia. The contract also includes the cable networks National Geographic Wild, Fox Business, and Fox Deportes (formerly Fox Sports en Espa√±ol). Programming affected by the dispute includes the coverage of the NFL on Fox, 2010 National League Championship Series, part of the 2010 World Series, and popular shows like American Idol and Glee. On October 16, 2010 at 12:01 am, Fox pulled all of their networks involved in the dispute from Cablevision subscribers. Because of Cablevision's dispute with ABC, Cablevision customers missed multiple new episodes of ABC network programming, multiple weeks of the NBA season, and the entire NLCS. Cablevision looped a public service announcement on each affected channel and forcing all of its customers' set-top boxes to channel 1999, which looped the same announcement, much like was done when Scripps Networks and ABC/Disney pulled their cable channels' programming. On October 27, 2010, the same day as Game 1 of the World Series, Cablevision offered a new one-year deal to FOX, which was rejected, continuing the blackout. Cablevision also repeatedly called on FOX to submit to binding arbitration, an offer which FOX repeatedly did not take Cablevision up on. The channels were restored during the evening of October 30, 2010, the same day as Game 3 of the World Series. News Corp and Cablevision reached a deal \\"in principle\\" to restore the channels. News Corp did not disclose the terms of the deal, but Cablevision said it paid the higher fees Fox and News Corp wanted, \\"because it does not think its customers should any longer be denied the Fox programs they wish to see.\\" =Game Show Network= In February 2011, Cablevision moved the Game Show Network (GSN) from the basic tier to an add-on sports package. In October 2011, GSN filed a lawsuit claiming that the network was being discriminated against because Cablevision gave preference to other channels that they owned (AMC Networks) which did not move. In November 2016, a Federal Communications Commission administrative law judge that Cablevision had acted unlawfully and recommended that the FCC require Cablevision (now Altice) to carry the channel on their expanded basic tier and imposed a maximum fine of $400,000. =Tribune Company dispute= On August 17, 2012, without warning, Cablevision pulled stations from the Tribune Company. The removed stations included WPIX (New York), which is carried on most Cablevision systems, WPHL (Philadelphia) on Central Jersey systems in Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean Counties, WCCT (Hartford, CT) on some Connecticut systems, and KWGN (Denver) on Optimum West systems in Colorado and Wyoming. WTIC-TV and WGN America were initially not included in this dispute, but on August 24, Tribune pulled WTIC in Connecticut and WGN from Cablevision's Connecticut and Optimum West systems. Like the dispute with Time Warner Cable and Hearst Television, these channels were replaced with other cable offerings. In a statement, Cablevision said that \\"The bankrupt Tribune Co. and the hedge funds and banks that own it, including Oaktree Capital Management, Angelo Gordon & Co. and others, are trying to solve Tribune's financial problems on the backs of Cablevision customers. Tribune and their hedge fund owners are demanding tens of millions in new fees for WPIX and other stations they own. They should stop their anti-consumer demands and work productively to reach an agreement.\\" Tribune, in its own statement, said that \\"Cablevision took this action despite our offer of an unconditional extension of the current carriage agreement with no change in terms while negotiations continued. To be clear, Tribune was willing to provide Cablevision subscribers access to the valuable programming on these stations while working toward a new agreement. Tribune never made any threat to withdraw these stations or any demand that Cablevision remove them. Tribune makes a substantial annual investment in local news, live sports and high-quality entertainment programming. Cablevision has never compensated Tribune for the retransmission of its local stations, which are among the most highly watched channels on Cablevision's lineups. What we have proposed amounts to less than a penny a day per subscriber, well below what Cablevision pays to providers of less well-watched channels\\". The dispute between the two companies ended on October 26, 2012, when Cablevision reached an agreement with Tribune after Connecticut viewers complained about not seeing the first two games of the 2012 World Series. The channels were not restored until the morning of October 27. =Meredith Corporation dispute= On January 3, 2014, WFSB, the CBS station in Hartford, CT, pulled its signal from Cablevision's Connecticut systems. The dispute was due to the fact that Cablevision did not want to pay Meredith Corporation, the station's owner, for Fairfield County and Litchfield County customers, because they already had the flagship CBS station, WCBS-TV from New York. The dispute ended on January 19. Corporate governance At the time of the sale to Altice, the board of directors of Cablevision were: Charles Dolan, James Dolan, Patrick Dolan, Kristin Dolan, Marianne Dolan Weber, Rand Araskog, Frank Biondi, Charles Ferris, Richard Hochman, Victor Oristano, Thomas Reifenheiser, John R. Ryan, Brian Sweeney, Vincent Tese, Leonard Tow. In 2006, the Dolan family announced a plan to purchase the company and privatize it, after a failed attempt in 2005, which would have spun off Rainbow Media as a publicly traded company. On May 2, 2007, after repeated attempts, the Dolan family announced that a deal worth $10.6 billion had been reached for Cablevision to be taken private, but agreement was not reached with other shareholders.Cablevision Agrees to Be Taken Private, Yahoo!, May 2, 2007 Cablevision stock trades under the ticker symbol CVC on the New York Stock Exchange.  Financial records  On November 11, 2003, the company admitted that it had misrepresented some of its finances. It would restate its previously reported financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2003, and would revise the quarterly financial results released that day, to reflect the impact of expenses totaling approximately $15 million that were improperly recorded in 2002 and earlier periods. On March 2, 2004, the company also said it would restate annual results for 2000 to 2002, in addition to its previously announced restatement of quarterly results in 2002 and 2003.

From 1993 to 2016, Sykes hosted a conservative talk show on WTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was also the editor of Right Wisconsin which was co-owned with WTMJ's then-parent company E. W. Scripps. Early life and education Charles Jay Sykes was born in 1954 in Seattle, Washington and later grew up in New York and Fox Point, Wisconsin. He is the son of Katherine \\"Kay\\" Border and Jay G. Sykes, a lawyer who later worked as a journalist for several small newspapers in New York before settling with the Milwaukee Sentinel in 1962. Jay later became a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union Wisconsin chapter and ran for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin unsuccessfully against Martin J. Schreiber in the 1970 primary. After graduating from Nicolet High School, Sykes enrolled at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee where he graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in English in 1975. While at Milwaukee, Sykes was a member of the Young Democrats, and following a nonreligious upbringing, Sykes converted to Roman Catholicism at age 18. In 1974, using the slogan \\"A Different Kind of Democrat\\" due to his opposition to abortion, Sykes challenged Republican incumbent Jim Sensenbrenner for Wisconsin State Assembly and lost. As Milwaukee Magazine profiled: \\"...his pro-life campaign signaled a growing crack in his liberalism. And as elements within the antiwar movement became violent, he became increasingly disillusioned.\\" Career =Writing= Sykes began his career as a journalist, starting in 1975 with West Allis, Wisconsin weekly The Northeast Post for a year. In 1976, Sykes joined The Milwaukee Journal, starting with reporting on stories in the North Shore suburbs, before being promoted to the Milwaukee City Hall beat during the administration of Mayor Henry Maier. After seven years of reporting in the Milwaukee area, Sykes moved to Cleveland in 1982 as a staff writer for Cleveland Magazine, but the magazine went out of business by the end of the year. Sykes returned to Milwaukee as managing editor at Milwaukee Magazine in 1983 and moved up to editor-in-chief in January 1984. Sykes wrote features, investigative articles, and commentary for Milwaukee Magazine. Sykes has been a published author, primarily concerning education. He made his book debut in 1988 with Profscam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education, inspired by his father's essay published posthumously in the October 1985 Milwaukee Magazine recalling his experience teaching at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. In addition, Sykes has written commentary for Imprimis, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and has edited WI Interest, the magazine of the Badger Institute (formerly the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute) and the website Right Wisconsin. Since December 2018, Sykes has been editor-in-chief of The Bulwark. =Radio and podcasting= In an era when the national success of Rush Limbaugh was inspiring similar call-in talk radio shows around the U.S., Sykes started hosting talk radio in 1989 as a substitute host for Mark Belling at WISN in Milwaukee. Sykes got his own show on WISN by 1992. Lacking a contract with WISN, Sykes jumped to WTMJ within a year and hosted a morning show there until December 19, 2016. In 2002, Sykes and fellow WTMJ host Jeff Wagner gained prominence in leading a campaign to recall Milwaukee County Executive Tom Ament, who was embroiled in scandal for changing the county pension policy to give himself and close aides large payouts; Ament controversially retired at the end of February 2002, rather than resign, to retain his pension. In a 2005 speech, Jay Heck, executive director of the Wisconsin branch of the liberal political advocacy group Common Cause referred to Sykes's influence on local politicians. \\"The Sykes Republicans from southeastern Wisconsin are worried that he will castigate them by calling them RINOs, 'Republicans in name only.' So (he makes it) very difficult for Republicans to be independent of the party line on any issue.\\" On July 26, 2005, WTMJ settled a libel lawsuit against Sykes for $5,000 with Spanish Journal editor Robert Miranda, over a November 2004 blog post by Sykes that alleged that Miranda in 1991 organized a protest that became violent in opposition to a \\"pro-American\\" rally at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, information that Sykes later retracted. Sykes did not support the Donald Trump presidential 2016 bid, campaigning against him and instead choosing to cast a write-in vote for independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin. In October 2016, Sykes announced that he had decided late in 2015 to quit his radio show for unspecified personal reasons. In December 2016, Sykes wrote a New York Times op-ed suggesting that the conservative movement had lost its way during the 2016 campaign, saying \\"...as we learned this year, we had succeeded in persuading our audiences to ignore and discount any information from the mainstream media. Over time, we'd succeeded in delegitimizing the media altogether ‚Äî all the normal guideposts were down, the referees discredited.\\" From January to April 2017, Sykes was part of a rotating set of hosts of Indivisible, a call-in talk show distributed by WNYC public radio in New York City, along with Brian Lehrer of WNYC and Kerri Miller of Minnesota Public Radio among others. The show analyzed and discussed the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's new administration.Indivisible: The Trailer, wnyc.org In February 2018, Sykes became the new host of The Daily Standard, the revived podcast of The Weekly Standard magazine.

Plot Liang Ta-cheng (Alan Tam), from a well-to-do Taipei family, wants to spend this year's summer break working instead of again spending time with his annoying American cousin Ellen (Lee Lieh), who has a crush on him. This proposal is immediately turned down by his rich father (Wei Su), who considers working menial jobs a disgrace, so Ta-cheng leaves home to join his college friends operating a restaurant. The restaurant struggles to make ends meet with too many workers, and some of the friends are forced to work elsewhere. Ho Kuo-juei finds a job in a hair salon, where he encounters and falls in love with Ellen. Liang begins working as a superintendent in a residential building, and meets a young babysitter named Ah Hsiang (Ing Tsae-ling), whom he is instantly smitten with. Because of her work, he believes her to be from a low socioeconomic background, so he takes her to watch Taiwanese opera (which is enjoyed by mostly uneducated folks), not realizing Ah Hsiang feels exactly the same way about him. After getting fired for mistaking burglars as furniture movers, Liang follows Ah Hsiang to work as live-in servants in an estate, where their romance further develops. The family turns out to be highly dysfunctional, forcing them to quit their jobs. Ah Hsiang refuses to tell Liang her home address, and both are heartbroken. Having returned to college after the break, Liang attends a conference for an inter-collegiate association, and discovers the association president is none other than Ah Hsiang. Ah Hsiang is also shocked that Liang is a college student. The film ends with the pair catching the burglars, again posing as movers.

Since August 2017, he has been the president of the American Sociological Association.  Early influences  Bonilla-Silva was educated in Puerto Rico where he double majored in Sociology and Economics. In his work White Supremacy and Racism in the Post-civil Rights Era, he says that \\"Myriam Muniz, Arturo Torrecillas, Carlos Buitrago, Juan Jose Baldrich, Carlos Ramos [...] shaped my sociological imagination.\\" Bonilla-Silva has stated that Jose A. Padin and Charles Camic were two mentors that influenced his development as a sociologist. As an early sociologist, Bonilla-Silva was focused on Marxist ideas. He learned this from his mentor, Arturo Torrecillas. Torrecillas served as a professor of the Sociology and Anthropology Department at Bonilla-Silva's undergraduate university.  Family and early life  Born in Pennsylvania, Silva grew up in a family of intellectuals. His father, Jacinto Silva, was a university lecturer and his mother, Ruth Maria Silva, was a sociologist like her son. Bonilla-Silva married Mary Hovsepian He has a son named Omar Francisco Bonilla from a previous marriage. Education and career Bonilla- Silva received his BA in sociology and economics from the University of Puerto Rico, R√≠o Piedras Campus in 1984, and his MA and PhD from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1987 and 1993, respectively. He taught at the University of Michigan from 1993‚Äì1998 and at Texas A&M; University from 1998‚Äì2005, after which he joined the Duke faculty. Work and views Bonilla-Silva is known for researching the role of race in public life. In 2003, he published the book Racism Without Racists: Colorblind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States, which discusses his view that systemic racism is a major problem in the United States, despite the fact that Americans do not do or say something overtly racist on a regular basis. As of 2014, it was his best-selling book. He has said that systemic racism in the United States did not disappear in the 1970s, as many Americans believe, but merely became less overt and harder to identify. He has also blamed the fact that formerly all-white colleges in the United States did not change their curriculum or culture after integrating for racist incidents re-occurring on the campuses of these colleges. He has described these colleges as \\"historically white\\", and has said that this problem is not one of bad apples, but that it may be one of the entire apple tree. In October 2017, Bonilla-Silva criticized Supreme Court Justice John Roberts for referring to social science as \\"sociological gobbledygook.\\"  Publications and evolution of sociological views  In both his personal life and as a student, Bonilla-Silva encountered many influences. His professors, friends, coworkers, and eventually his own students all impacted his growth and development as a sociologist. As a student, he was influenced by Marxist teachings. However, he changed his focus soon as he learned and encountered racial prejudice and felt a calling to deal with the racism in the United States. This is evidenced by the explosion of published literature centering the structure of race in society and its influence on people. In one of his earliest literature, Bonilla-Silva suggested a \\"structural\\" understanding of racism, a relatively unexplored and revolutionary way of approaching this idea. This was shown in his work _Rethinking racism: Toward a structural interpretation_. This work was done near the end of his time while the scholar was at the University of Michigan, before he started working at Texas A&M; University. As Bonilla-Silva continued to expand the boundaries of the understanding of racism, his literature reflected these new findings. Examples include: * Racism Without Racists (4th Ed) ** In this book published in 2014, Bonilla-Silva delves into a discussion regarding race relationships in modern America. Despite the political correctness that has permeated society, racism still exists on a broad scale. The stereotyping and categorization of people by their skin color or heritage continues to be a big role in society. The author bring this issue to light, considering a broad range of perspectives. Moreover, he also takes a historical view on this issue since the past has a really big influence on how modern society thinks and functions. * What We Were, What We Are, and What We Should Be: The Racial Problem of American Sociology ** This journal publication comes in light of Bonilla-Silva's new position as president of the American Sociological Association. He considers this new position along with the problems that sociologists like him are trying to solve in the realm of race relationships and racism. In a way, this publication serves as a public statement of his mission, his values as the new president. * Other works also include: ** The new racism: The racial regime of post-civil rights America ** Introduction: Examining, debating, and ranting about the Obama phenomenon ** The Sweet Enchantment of Color Blindness in Black Face: Explaining the ‚ÄúMiracle,‚Äù Debating the Politics, and Suggesting a Way for Hope to be ‚ÄúFor Real‚Äù in America ** The invisible weight of whiteness: the racial grammar of everyday life in contemporary America ** The last shall be first: Best Books in the Race Field Since 2000 ** The 2008 Elections and the Future of Anti- racism in 21st Century America Or How We Got Drunk with Obama's Hope Liquor and Failed to See Reality ** and many more... From all of these works, it is evident that Bonilla-Silva has been an active scholar in the sociological topic of race. He has taken several angles at the topic, investigating it from a historical lens, a political lens such as with the recent political administration run by President Obama, and from his perspective looking at modern society. His seminal works have largely contributed to new ideas and new ways of envisioning the influence of racism in society. Awards Bonilla-Silva received the 2011 Cox-Johnson-Frazier Award from the American Sociological Association (ASA). In 2009, he and Tukufu Zuberi both received the Oliver C. Cox Award from the ASA's Section on Racial and Ethnic Minorities for their book White Logic, White Methods: Racism and Methodology.

Legends describe intellectual rivalry between Sri Thanonchai and others (especially the King of Ayutthaya). Sri Thanonchai is often compared to the German folk character Till Eulenspiegel.  Plot (synopsis)  During the Ayutthaya Period, Thai peasants struggled under draconian laws and authoritarian government. Sri Thanonchai's tricks subvert these systems, most often through word play or interpreting orders too literally. Some tricks are sinister or sadistic in nature. For example, when told to ‚Äútie up‚Äù his master's cattle, Sri Thanonchai hangs them from a tree. Eventually, the trickster schemes his way into the royal court and remains there until death. His tricks frequently offend the monarch, who several times orders his execution, but always Sri Thanonchai escapes by deceiving the executioners, or proves his innocence in court by demonstrating that he never told an untruth and was only following orders. Despite many outrages, the king always pardons Sri Thanonchai‚Äîpartly in resignation, because no one can outsmart him, and partly in recognition of his service. Many of Sri Thanonchai's tricks humiliate the enemies of Ayutthaya by turning their pride or greed against them. For example, a Burmese bull tamer challenges Ayutthayans to a bullfight with his unbeatable bovine. Sri Thanonchai meets the challenger with a calf. The bull refuses to fight and leaves the ring, thus forfeiting the match. The Sri Thanonchai story is divided into episodes that each tell a particular story.‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ï, ‡∏ß‡∏¥‡πÑ‡∏•‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ô‡πå and ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏ß‡∏∏‡∏í‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå, ‡∏ò‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ä‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢ (2555) ‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ß‡∏£‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏Ñ‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏∞: ‡∏≠‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≤ ‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ò‡∏ô‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢ ‡∏™‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Ç‡πå‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ß‡∏£‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏´‡∏á‡∏™‡πå ‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏ã. ‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ã‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏™. The following examples illustrate Sri Thanonchai's diverse methods and motives for trickery. = Birth = Sri Thanonchai's mother-to-be one night dreams that she brings the moon back to her house. She tells her husband about her dream, and her husband tells the Brahman about the dream. The Brahman says that they will have a bright child. Later the wife gives birth to Sri Thanonchai. He is the only child in the family, but later his mother bears another son. His brother receives a lot of attention from his family, and Sri Thanonchai becomes jealous. Sri Thanonchai's mother asks him to wash his brother. Sri Thanonchai proceeds to \\"clean\\" his brother as one cleans meat‚Äîby butchering him, cleaning him inside and out. When his parents return home and find their son dead, they banish Sri Thanonchai to live in the Temple. = Roofing = One day the Monk sees that the Roof of the temple is old and it is falling down so he asks the temple boys to fix the roof. Sri Thanonchai was the only boy who did not help. The other temple boys tell the monk that Sri Thanonchai did not help. Sri Thanonchai is scared that the monk will get mad at him so he reconstructs the roof himself. The other boys fixed the roof by twisting it to the right, so Sri Thanonchai twists the roof to the left. When the monk arrives, Sri Thanonchai asks his friends ‚Äúwhich way did you twist the roof?‚Äù His friends answer ‚Äúto the right‚Äù. The monk looks up and see that the roof is twisted to the left so he believes that Sri Thanonchai was the one who constructed the roof. = King of Ayutthaya = The King of Ayutthaya was strolling in the royal gardens with his courtesans and courtiers. As they reached a garden pond, the king, thinking to challenge Sri Thanonchai's wit, taunted him. ‚ÄúYou are brainy, Sri Thanonchai. Can you think of a way to make your king go into this pond?‚Äù Sri Thanonchai answered. ‚ÄúYour Majesty, I could not persuade you to get into this water. That I could not do. But I could certainly make you come out of the water‚Äù. ‚ÄúLet us see‚Äù and the king quickly took off his clothes and lowered himself into the pond. Floating in the water, he asked. ‚ÄúNow, Sri Thanonchai. Start talking. How will you make me come out of this water?‚Äù Sri Thanonchai laughed. Bowing politely to the king, he said ‚ÄúDear Majesty. I was not attempting to make you come out of this pond. I was attempting to make you go into the pond. And as you can see, I have succeeded!‚Äù. ‚ÄúSri Thanonchai, you are too clever!‚Äù exclaimed the king. He came out of the water graciously, pleased with the wit of Sri Thanonchai. = Watermelon seeds = The King punishes Sri Thanonchai by sending him to stay on an isolated island. Luckily foreigners visit on a boat. Sri Thanonchai hides on the boat to get a ride to Market. During the ride, he sees the foreigners bring two big watermelons, both cut in half. The foreigners say that they will bring these two watermelons to gambling with the king. Sri Thanonchai knows what is happening, so he hides in the Palace. The next day, the foreigners bring the two watermelons to the king, and ask him to guess how many seeds are in the watermelons. If the king wins the foreigner will give the king everything he has but if the king loses, the king has to give the foreigner the city. At this time the king is thinking of Sri Thanonchai and asks a soldier to go and get him. Suddenly Sri Thanonchai appears and volunteers to guess the number of seeds. He pretends to do complicated calculations but gives the correct number of seeds in the watermelon as he has seen it before. This feat allows him to return and work in the palace.  Characterization  The main character is Sri Thanonchai. He is a trickster who can talk his way out of any situation, and he is good at twisting words and making people believe him. He persistently claims to be innocent and to do exactly what people tell him to do.‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ï, ‡∏ß‡∏¥‡πÑ‡∏•‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ô‡πå and ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡∏ß‡∏∏‡∏í‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå, ‡∏ò‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ä‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢ (2555) ‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ß‡∏£‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏Ñ‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏∞: ‡∏≠‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≤ ‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ò‡∏ô‡∏ç‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢ ‡∏™‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Ç‡πå‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ß‡∏£‡∏£‡∏ì‡∏´‡∏á‡∏™‡πå ‡∏Ñ‡∏±‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏ã.‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ã‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏™. Although he slacks off from every chore or official duty, he never backs down from a challenge. He embarks on many ventures, such as merchant trading and ordination as a novice monk. King Jessada plays a large supporting role, alternately praising or punishing Sri Thanonchai. The king is characterized by good humor but a quick temper, a penchant for gambling, and a vengeful streak. Sri Thanonchai's final tricks include making the king crawl on his knees to Sri Thanonchai's deathbed. Minor characters include Srinuan and Saiyud, Sri Thanonchai's two wives, both won by trickery. Srinuan occasionally assists Sri Thanonchai in his pranks. The final episodes are occupied by an unnamed character who represents Sri Thanonchai's brother, re-incarnated to exact revenge. The young man outsmarts Sri Thanonchai on three occasions, so that he finally dies of shame‚Äîbut not before staging a final trick to occur at his funeral.  Cultural significance  Mechai Thongthep writes, ‚ÄúSlavish obedience had particular significance in Ayudhya‚Äôs feudal society . . . Little could be more immediately gratifying than literally obeying commands to the detriment of authorities issuing them. Similarly, opportunism and blind greed contributed to many a person‚Äôs downfall, particularly when terms of agreement were not clearly specified.‚Äù Particularly notable characteristics are ‚Äúthe way he gains ascendancy over people by capitalising on their transparent greed; and his almost pathological determination to triumph in every situation . . . [Sri Thanonchai] personified the supremely alert individual who roguishly turned the tables on would-be vanquishers.‚Äù The Sri Thanonchai epic has over thirty traditional versions, including a nineteenth century verse epic. In modern times, it has been referenced or adapted in numerous comics, novels and films, such as the 2014 comedy film Sri Thanonchai 555+. Sri Thanonchai stories are further featured in temple murals at Wat Phrathum Wanaram in Bangkok. The traditional epic employs many Thai language aphorisms and puns. It also includes everyday portraits of Thai culture; for example, rules for monks, rituals for proposals and marriages, market life and Thai gambling. It explores the strata of medieval Thai society, including foreigners, peasants, monks, nobility, and the monarchy. As a primarily oral epic, it reflects the ambition of the lower classes to triumph against the higher classes, through ingenuity rather than brute force.  Other names  Sri Thanonchai is a well known character in central Thailand. In the north and northeast (Isan) of Thailand, as well as Laos, the character is called Xiang Miang. He is Saga Dausa in Myanmar and Thanon-Chai or Ah Thonchuy Prach in Cambodia.

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt, and was directed by David Grossman. Plot Opening quote: \\"The demon came home, and he declared that the air was not clear. 'I smell the flesh of man.\\" In the Mount Hood, a geologist, Jill Prembrey (Nicole Santora) retrieves rocks near a fumarole. Then, she is attacked by Markus Hemmings (Gill Gayle) who tries to get back the rocks but she manages to escape. He then woges into a Taureus- Armenta. Later, Jill is killed at her home by a creature covered in lava called Volcanalis. In the station, Hank (Russell Hornsby) is sent on vacation on behest of Nick (David Giuntoli), Wu (Reggie Lee) and Renard (Sasha Roiz). In Vienna, Adalind (Claire Coffee) is taken by Frau Pech (Mary McDonald-Lewis) to visit Stefania Vaduva Popescu (Shohreh Aghdashloo), who explains that a bloodline must be established for the child and they subdue Adalind to place needles on her. Juliette's visions continue haunting her, to the point where she crashes her car. She then visits Pilar (Bertila Damas) for help and she is given a tea to help her to focus and enter again in the past in an attempt to get the memories back. Nick and Wu go to the fumarole with Jill's boss to investigate the scene, where the boss retrieves rocks from the fumarole while Markus unsuccessfully tries to stop them. Adalind's test shows that the baby is of Royal blood and offers her money for the baby when is born. Adalind refuses the money, preferring to get her Hexenbiest powers back. Upon finding out that Markus's wife was killed years ago, Nick and Renard bring him to the station. He claims that he didn't kill the archaeologists, he was in fact warning them of the danger that would happen to them and they were killed by a creature named Volcanalis for stealing its rocks. The boss is killed by the Volcanalis that night and Nick tries to fight him back but he is no match for him. With information from the trailer, Nick, Renard and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) find that the Volcanalis is responsible for the eruption in Pompeii. They decide to call Markus for help as he is an expert on the topic. Markus claims that nothing can stop it \\"until hell freezes over\\". Nick then gets an idea to use liquid nitrogen to kill him. Nick, Monroe, Renard and Markus go to the mountain and take the rocks to a warehouse to wait for the Volcanalis to arrive. Using Markus as a bait, the Volcanalis appears and while advancing towards him, Nick, Monroe and Renard use the liquid nitrogen hoses to wash him and freeze him as a solid rock. Seeing he is still alive, Nick gives Markus a hammer to kill it so he can avenge his wife. Markus hits the Volcanalis until its eyes freeze over. Meanwhile, Juliette decides to remake the previous memories of Nick and she manages to control the problem. The episode ends as she now remembers the memory of Nick proposing to her.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"I don't like when the mythology and creature abilities on Grimm leave wide gaps for me to think about logic problems. It distracts from the episode, takes me out of a world I've come to enjoy, and for the most part learned to accept despite its flaws. But when the logic is stretched so thin ‚Äî Does the Volcanalis kill everyone who takes rocks from near any dormant volcano anywhere around the world at any time? ‚Äî it's impossible to ignore. Even with the benefit of two very interesting creature ‚Äî or one Wesen and a demigod figure ‚Äî 'Volcanalis' suffers from being too ridiculous to work completely as an episodic diversion.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.1 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"While serial elements accomplish two things: the first being it keeps reviews and the analysis fresh, and the second being is I enjoy storytelling that moves at a faster pace.

Elements of his life story influenced Mark Twain's 1889 novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Early life and career Ragsdale was born in , a hapa-haole or half-Hawaiian, half-Caucasian. His father Alexander Ragsdale was an American plantation owner originally from Virginia who had settled in Hawaii in 1817 and married Kahawaluokalani (Kahawalu), a minor Hawaiian chiefess and a descendant of King Kekaulike of Maui and his wife Kahawalu. His siblings were Edward Alexander Ragsdale (1839‚Äì1863) and Annie Green Ragsdale Dowsett (1842‚Äì1891), who married James Isaac Dowsett. He was considered a distant relative or cousin of Queen Emma. From 1861 to 1865, Ragsdale served as the first editor of Ka Nupepa K≈´ ªoko ªa (\\"The Independent Newspaper\\") for publisher Henry Martyn Whitney. After four years, he was replaced by missionary Luther Halsey Gulick, Sr. in 1865. His Roman Catholic faith was a probable reason why he was replaced, since the Hawaiian Congregationalists wished to have a newspaper more favorable to them. In 1866, Ragsdale was working as a government translator and interpreter for the Hawaiian legislature. American writer Mark Twain visited the island kingdom at the time and described the legislative session and Ragsdale: > Bill Ragsdale stands up in front of the Speaker's pulpit, with his back > against it, and fastens his quick black eye upon any member who rises, lets > him say half a dozen sentences and then interrupts him, and repeats his > speech in a loud, rapid voice, turning every Kanaka speech into English and > every English speech into Kanaka, with a readiness and felicity of language > that are remarkable ‚Äì waits for another installment of talk from the > member's lips and goes on with his translation as before. His tongue is in > constant motion from 11 in the forenoon till four in the afternoon, and why > it does not wear out is the affair of Providence, not mine. There is a spice > of deviltry in the fellow's nature and it crops out every now and then when > he is translating the speeches of slow old Kanakas who do not understand > English. Without departing from the spirit of a member's remarks, he will, > with apparent unconsciousness, drop in a little voluntary contribution > occasionally in the way of a word or two that will make the gravest speech > utterly ridiculous. He is careful not to venture upon such experiments, > though, with the remarks of persons able to detect him. I noticed when he > translated for His Excellency David Kalakaua, who is an accomplished English > scholar, he asked, \\"Did I translate you correctly, your Excellency?\\" or > something to that effect. The rascal. Superintendent of Kalaupapa Ragsdale replaced Jonatana Napela as superintendent of Kalaupapa. In early 1873, Ragsdale was practicing law in Hilo when he contracted leprosy. Working late one night, he accidentally knocked over an oil lamp and discovered that he felt no pain in his hands when he caught it before it fell. After the realization, Ragsdale contemplated his choices for a few months, then surrendered himself to the local authority in hope that others would be encouraged to do the same. He was sent to Kalihi Hospital in Honolulu where he was officially diagnosed with leprosy, and sent to the leper settlement at Kalaupapa, on the island of Molokai. Ragsdale arrived at Kalaupapa on June 29, 1873. Upon his arrival in the settlement, he worked as a translator and wrote letters to the government in Honolulu and the Board of Health complaining about the negligence of the incumbent luna (superintendent) Jonatana Napela in enforcing the Board's demands for rigid segregation of lepers and non-lepers in the settlement. He served as a mediator between the Board and the inmates, and assisted in improving the discipline and economy of the settlement. These actions gained him favors back in Honolulu. In October, 1873, Napela was discharged by the Board, and Ragsdale was promoted to the position of luna of Kalaupapa. He was referred to as \\"Governor\\", and later posthumous accounts called him \\"King of the Lepers\\". Ragsdale's restrictive policies and the limited resources provided by the Hawaiian government angered many of the patients. Peter Ka ªeo, a high-born chief and patient of the settlement, wrote that \\"since [Ragsdale] has been Luna he has made more Enemyes and less friends\\". In Honolulu, the government and press were much more supportive of his policies, with The Pacific Commercial Advertiser stating that \\"Ragsdale guides and regulates his little principality in most matters of government, quite as absolutely and undisputedly as the captain of a ship whose word is law\\". Except for a few confrontations with disgruntled patients, Ragsdale's tenure as luna remained relatively peaceful until his final illness. Death and legacy In the fall of 1877, Ragsdale's condition worsened, and he died on November 24, 1877. Ragsdale was buried in an unmarked grave in the cemetery grounds of Saint Philomena Catholic Church, founded by Father Damien.Kalaupapa National Historical Park He was mourned at home and abroad, with newspapers in Hawaii and the United States reporting on his death. Even The New York Times ran a story on the death of the \\"King of the Lepers\\". His obituary in Honoulu's The Pacific Commercial Advertiser noted: Father Damien (who had been at Kalaupapa as long as Ragsdale) was chosen briefly to replace him, but his unpopularity with the Protestant patients led to his being replaced by William Keolaloa Sumner, who had served as an assistant under Ragsdale. His friend Mark Twain later wrote a draft to fictional story based on Ragsdale's life which was never finished, although elements of the story were incorporated into Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.

In a democracy citizens have rights but also duties: with freedom comes responsibility. Unlike civil liability, the obligation to answer for damage one has caused, either by repairing it or paying damages and interest for it, criminal responsibility implies legal recourse for the state against a disturbance of the peace. This includes three major factors: *participation in a criminal offense *forms of criminal responsibility *exceptions to criminal responsibility.  Participation  = The author and the co-author = * The material author of the infraction is the person who physically performs the actions necessary to make up the criminal action. In the case of a murder this would be the person who struck the fatal blow. For crimes of omission the material author would be the person who didn't move when he had the possibility to rescue someone. Under the Ancien R√©gime a collective responsibility was often envisaged. This concept disappeared in the codes, although jurisprudence sometimes makes use of a concept of collective guilt, but this is most apparent in conspiracy cases. (Article 450-1) Indeed, in a conspiracy, each participant in the group is considered the principal author of the infraction. * The co-author materially participates in events at the side of the principal author, and incurs the same prescribed penalties, even if the principal author is in the end finally declared non-responsible, as in a case of dementia for example. The co-author may have extenuating circumstances such as youth. Aggravating circumstances are also possible, such as recidivism. Not to be confused with the accomplice, who would, for example, be the person who furnished the killer with a weapon. * The moral author acts in the wings to have the crime committed, for example someone who pays to have a person killed or to have an object stolen, and is sometimes also called the intellectual author. French law doesn't really have this concept and such actions are addressed as conspiracies and sometimes described as complicity by provocation or by instruction. * In the transition from the Napoleonic penal code of 1810 to the newer reformed criminal code, the reform commission considered including an autonomous criminal responsibility for intellectual authors but quickly abandoned the idea in the face of the difficulty of implementing such a modification of the criminal code while at the same time still preserving freedoms. However, in certain cases the moral authors may be prosecuted for the offense themselves, for instance for provocation to suicide or untruths. The untruths themselves are not criminal offences, nor is suicide. The \\"Perben 2\\" law of 2004 also created a specific infraction of instigating a crime, and sanctions the moral author of certain crimes, even when the instigation was not successful and the crime was not committed. = Attempt = The penal code declares that the authorship of a crime includes not just the person who commits the incriminating act, but also he who in the cases provided by the law, only attempts to commit it. An attempt is constituted when a beginning of execution has manifested and only was suspended or failed to have an effect because of circumstances independent of the author's will (Article 121-5) A person is an accomplice who knowingly offers aid or assistance to the preparation or commission of an infraction. A person is equally an accomplice a person who by gift, promise, threat order abuse of authority or of power provokes into an infraction or who gives instructions for committing it (Article 121-7) Article 121-4 of the penal code says that trying to commit a crime is punishable, but attempting to commit a misdemeanor is not, unless a law specifically so provides. Attempting to commit an infraction is never an offense. The author of an attempt is considered an author of the actual infraction of the penal code, and incurs the same penalties as if his attempt had succeeded.  Material element  = The beginning of execution = An attempt must manifest through the beginning of the commission of the infraction. The actor is no longer at the stage of preparatory actions, yet has not yet entirely found himself involved in the principal infraction. Jurisprudence defines the beginning of execution as the act or acts that \\"directly tend to the consommation of the infraction\\" (tendant directement √† la consommation de l'infraction). Example: arr√™t Lacour, crim. 25 October 1962: Mr Lacour paid an individual to murder the adopted son of his mistress. The hired killer pretended to kidnap the adopted son, then collected his payment before reporting Lacour to the police. Lacour was prosecuted, notably, for attempted murder. He was acquitted however, on the theory that his actions did not tend either directly or immediately towards the death of the victim. In reality, his actions were not attempted murder; they amounted to attempted conspiracy to commit murder. No matter what, Lacour would never have been a murderer, just an accomplice. Without having acted immediately and directly to commit the crime, he did not have a punishable attempt under the law of intent (although his actions could nonetheless be sanctioned under other criteria). Attempted insurance fraud has given place to an important piece of jurisprudence: simply simulating a fire is merely a non-punishable act of preparation, because it does not result immediately and directly in disbursement of the policy amount. On the other hand, submitting a claim to the insurance company after making a false statement to the police would constitute the beginning of execution for the crime of fraud. A false declaration or statement, accompanied by fraudulent manoeuvers, or by staging or manipulating the evidence, have also been considered to amount to a beginning of execution. = Failure to voluntarily desist = An attempt is a failed crime and the failure of that crime was contrary to the will of its author. On the other hand, preparing then voluntarily desisting from the criminality before the crime is committed halts any prosecution. This mechanism can be explained differently. The person who voluntarily renounces his criminal business has shown that he wasn't dangerous. The law encourages future wrongdoers to renounce their path and offers impunity as a reward. One can equally explain the mechanism by justifying its prevention of criminal attempts: the idea is to punish the person whose irrevokable criminal intention has not yet led him to carry out the crime in question. So the person who renounces his criminal intentions proves by doing so that they were not irrevocable, and therefore in law there was no attempted crime. If the attempt failed for reasons beyond the intentions of its author, such as a missed shot, an unexpected passerby or the arrival of law enforcement, a stooge unexpectedly quitting, or sometimes the actions of the victim (a rapist fleeing because of victim's screams),Crim. 26 avril 2000. the attempted crime is punishable. The failure to voluntarily desist does not necessarily require the intervention of an outside force: Crim. 10 janvier 1996 held that an attempted rape which could not be completed due to the criminal's sexual dysfunction was nevertheless an attempted rape. The problem may arise where the causes of the criminal stopping before he commits a crime was are mixed; for example, a moralizing friend dissuades an offender from committing a planned burglary.(Crim. 20 mars 1974). Circumstances in such cases have not forced him to desist but he hasn't independently or spontaneously opted not to commit the crime either. The letter of the law, article 121-5 of the penal code, specifies that an attempted crime has occurred when the criminal action did not succeed solely because of circumstances independent of the defendant's actions. The problem of an offender who flees in fear, for example, perhaps because he heard a noise, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Jurisprudence generally seems to lean towards impunity when the fear was spontaneous. Voluntarily desisting must come before the action is taken in order to absolve the defendant of responsibility. Some specialized statutes reward active repentance after an offense is committed, the conspiracy statutes for example, but these remain the exception. Penal law does not as such take into account voluntarily desisting from further offenses after a crime has been committed, seeing this as remorse with no judicial value.  Moral element  The author of the attempted crime must have had the intent to carry it out. This element, which does not seem particularly remarkable at first glance, is nonetheless essential. This criminal intent justifies preventing attempted crime, regardless of any disturbances of the public order.  A special case of attempt: the impossible infraction  Impossible offenses are those which were not carried out, not because of clumsiness or a chance intervening event, but because of an objective impossibility to commit the offence. Some impossibilities are legislated into criminality: for example, the old penal code defined a crime of aborting a woman believed to be pregnant. This can be compared to provisions that refer to real or supposed attributes of certain persons, especially in matters of discrimination (article 225-1) of the penal code. It might seem impossible to be guilty of antisemitism towards a person who isn't Jewish, but this putative infraction is nonetheless outlawed. Hypothetical impossible infractions unanticipated by legislators remain. Initially, 19th-century jurisprudence considered that if an offense was impossible it was also impossible to outlaw it. Since the offense had not been committed, the only possible grounds to prosecute it would be as an attempted crime. The reasoning that leads to impunity relies on the very definition of an attempt: starting to execute the criminal action means performing the individual physical movements that lead directly and immediately to the criminal act. When the action is impossible there can exist no actions that tend to lead to it either directly or immediately. Therefore, no punishable attempted crime takes place; what does occur is a disturbance in the public peace. This reasoning, which has legality going for it as well as a certain rationality, however, allowed offenders to escape prosecution who had nonetheless demonstrated their dangerousness and the irrevocability of their criminal determination. Faced with this reproach, jurisprudence took a middle path, seeking inspiration in doctrinal propositions which notably sought to distinguish between absolute and relative impossibility. The former occurs when the object of the infraction does not exist, such as in the murder of a corpse, or when the means are intrinsically ineffective, such as poisoning with a non-toxic substance. Relative impossibility exists when the object of it exists but cannot for the moment be reached, or when the means used could have succeeded, a badly-aimed bullet for example. The doctrine also proposed a distinction between impossibility in fact (prosecutable) vs impossibility in law, where a critical element of the infraction is missing. None of these criteria proved intellectually or judicially satisfactory. The Court of cassation, the French court of final appeal, eventually elected to systematically prosecute impossible infractions within its jurisdiction; see the Perdereau decision of 16 January 1986. In this case the crime was the attempted murder of a cadaver. The Court of cassation underlined that the prior demise of the victim was a circumstance beyond the author's control, which could be analyzed as a failure to voluntarily desist, leading to the failure of the planned criminality. The court added that the violence done to the cadaver constituted a beginning to execute the murder. This interpretation does not correspond to the classic definition of beginning to execute; in no case can striking a cadaver lead directly or immediately or in the long term for that matter to the death of a human being. It is a putative crime, which exists only in the mind of its author, but which is prosecuted because the blows that were struck were struck in the intention of committing the crime. The beginning of execution was not the primary element of this attempt; the attempted crime is used here more as a means to prove irrevokable intention. Since this decision one may ask about the survival of classical solutions to imaginary infractions: *is statutory rape carried out against an adult an attempted statutory rape? *Planning an assassination that uses sorcery and spells, would that be attempted murder? *Is theft of an object that one actually owns attempted theft The doctrine excludes from proceedings the hypotheses about motive that they cannot attribute to any crime, contrary to the attempted commission of an impossible infraction it considered sufficient proof of intent to commit a crime. Still, a perceptible difference still separates a murderous attack that would have succeeded if the person had been alive from an allegedly sorcerous assassination, assuming that you don't believe in sorcerous assassination. The danger is falling into mindless prosecution of simple thoughts and possibly of the desires or craving to do things the justice system would consider criminal, which would essentially amount to thought crime. = The accomplice = An accomplice furnishes help or assistance that facilitates the preparation or execution of a crime or other offence:\\"whoever by gift, promise, threat, order, or abuse of authority or power gives instructions to commit an infraction.\\" Complicity may be defined as a temporary, even momentary, understanding between individuals who are going to commit or try to commit one or more infractions. More simply, an accomplice participates in the action without himself needing to meet each element of the criteria that make up the infraction. As with the infraction itself, assessing the extent of complicity will depend in each case on legal, material and moral elements.  Material element  Legislators have narrowly and precisely defined the behaviors that can be charged as complicity: * Help or assistance: Help with the preparation or commission of the offense. This can range from standing lookout to furnishing stamps for false documents to loaning a vehicle. * Provocation or instigation: This behavior pushes the author of the offense to commit it, using a means foreseen by the legislation. Thus not all forms of provocation are punishable, only those carried out by: ** gift ** threat ** promise ** order ** abuse of authority or power. ***Also, whatever method is used must be sufficiently suggestive, individual or direct. Simple advice or suggestion cannot be penalized. And the incitement must be followed by an effect; a murder committed two years later for completely different reasons cannot be criminalized. * Instructions are information given to facilitate or allow commission of the offense, such as providing the floor plan of a bank building to a robber. For complicity to exist causality must be established. Legislators have also provided for a number of cases where complicity is not punishable: *passive assent In principle, abstention is never punishable and this has been fairly consistent in case law. In some cases however the judge decided that inaction was punishable, especially where the person had a protective role towards the author, his parents for example, or people whose work this is, such as policemen or guards. Thus in 1989 a mother was found guilty of leaving a weapon available to her son, who used it to kill his father. This theory holds that an accomplice by abstention is punishable if he knew about the offense, and had the means to prevent it but refrained, so that the crime was committed. *complicity after the fact In principle help given after the primary act has been performed is not criminalized, but here too legislators have enacted exceptions, criminalizing certain behaviors such as concealing the fruit of a crime, or its author, for example. Case law holds that help after the fact constitutes complicity if it results from a prior agreement. (Although one might suppose that the help is actually constituted by the agreement itself; in effect, promising the offender assistance after the crime is what made up his mind to take action.) The Court of cassation seems to also endorse guilty findings when the offender is an habitual delinquent and the help encourages him to repeat his bad behavior.  Moral element  The material element cannot be the only criteria as this would engender a climate of suspicion harmful to society. So, therefore, a person can only become an accomplice willingly, and must be aware of the offender's plans and agree with them. Also, if the project described to the accomplice differs from the one that is carried out, the accomplice will only be held to account for the project of which he had knowledge. Therefore, if he loaned a firearm to intimidate and not to kill, he cannot be held responsible for the murder, although this requires also that the difference between the plan and the reality be noticeable. so if simple theft was intended and this became theft with breaking and entering this breaking and entering will be taken into account. Normally there can be no complicity in unintentional offenses but in certain cases, especially faults of imprudence, such as inciting someone to run a red light or to drive while drunk, complicity may be retained.  Legal element  Criminal law, unlike civil law, allows very little freedom of interpretation to the judge and the legislator must foresee that which l√©galement un acte de complicit√© et notamment la theory de l'emprunt de criminality * The primary action must be a criminal offense: thus one cannot be prosecuted for having helped in the commission of an act which is not an infraction. The case of provocation to suicide mentioned above is an infraction in itself, although suicide itself is not. * In the old penal code the infraction must have had a certain severity (at least have been a misdemeanor) but under the new code it is possible to be an accomplice to a merely citable offense. * The principal act must have been committed: an accomplice who organizes everything but whose principal author does not begin execution cannot be prosecuted. The infracrtion must at least have been attempted. If a fact may justify the infraction‚Äîlegitimate defense for example‚Äîthe infraction is erased and that of the accomplice as well. In cases of immunity, or theft between spouses, the accomplice cannot be prosecuted, unless the judge determines that the person presented as an accomplice is in fact a co-author, in which case he is still within reach of prosecution. Procedurally the statute of limitations for an accomplice runs from the same day as for the principal author, and the withdrawal of a victim's complaint puts an end to prosecution of the accomplice as well. Amnesty for the infraction also benefits the accomplice. Another question is whether it complicity in complicity is punishable. Article 121-7 specifies that a second- degree complicity is only legally punishable with respect to knowing or informed help or assistance, even through the intermediary of another accomplice in the case of fraud, but the jurisprudence is rather severe and generally finds complicity even in the third degree. In addition, while it is necessary that the infraction be punishable for complicity to be punishable, the infraction need not necessarily be punished. A guilty verdict for the accomplice is not tied to the sanction of the principal author of the crime. Thus if the principal author is not prosecuted for reasons of dementia, the accomplice can still be prosecuted, and the same if the principal author has died or could not be arrested.  Sanction incurred  The principle in the old pernal code was that the accomplice and the author incur the same penalties, In the new code, the co-author does not necessarily face the same penally as the principal author. Also, he must have been able to commit the primary offense to be sentenced for it. For example, an individual cannot be charged with an offense that can only be committed by a member of law enforcement; he can at most be an accomplice. Henceforth any personal circumstances that might play in the favor of a principal author no longer do the same for an accomplice, the same real circumstances of the act (break-in, provocation, carrying a weapon) that could be held for or against the principal author will do sa as well for the accomplice. For example, in the case of a homicide committed by two persons, one of whom is the son of the victim, the latter, even if only an accomplice to the murder of his father, can receive as heavy a sentence as the principal author, since parricide constitutes a mixed aggravating circumstance.  Persons responsible: the principle of responsibility for personal actions  = Physical persons subject to criminal responsibility = * According to article 121-1 of the new penal code, \\"none are penally responsible for any but their own actions.\\" (Nul n'est responsable p√©nalement que de son propre fait.) In the old code this rule existed only in case law. One exception exists, the actions committed by a person under the authority of another. In this precise case, the person with authority can be found guilty of the actions committed by the person under his authority. Such would be the head of a company when an employee causes an accident while making a delivery for the enterprise. He can escape this responsibility by proving a prior delegation of authority, in which case the holder of the authority will be responsible.  Minors  Normally the attributes of the person do not affect his criminal responsibility, except for the one case where the person is a minor. This distinction is based in part on a difference between the abilities of children and of adults to understand mistakes. Minors, therefore, benefit from dedicated courts, but procedures and penalties also differ. = History = Until 1912, there were no court procedures specifically geared to minors. It was just generally understood that if a sentence were to be imposed on a minor, he benefitted from the \\"excuse of youth\\", which generally reduced the penalty by half. The law of 22 July 1912 transformed the system by putting juvenile courts into place, along with an absolute presumption of non-responsibility for minors 13 and under. Special penalties were also created in the law, such as supervised freedom, which allowed the minor to be placed in an institution and thus to be re- educated. Then came the ordonnance du 2 f√©vrier 1945 on delinquent childhood, which while reworked several times, remains in effect today. In this system it is the personality of the author more than the act itself which enters into account. The system is above all preventive and more geared to avoiding recidivism than to sanctioning a mistake.  Advent of the responsibility of minors  In France, a minor of 13 cannot be sentenced to a penalty, but is nonetheless responsible for his actions. Article 122-8 of the code p√©nal provides that \\"Minors capable of discernment are penally responsible for the crimes, misdemeanors or offences of which they have been found guilty. While poorly written, Article 122-8 is without possible appeal: a minor who has discernment is responsible for his actions. Still, the many measures that apply to him tend to sow doubt among legal practitioners and some works still speak of the non-responsibility of delinquent juveniles. The ordonnance n¬∞ 45-171 of 2 February 1945 considers the following categories of minor and the measures it envisages for them: * Minor of 10 without discernment: absolute penal non-responsibility * Minor of 13 with discernment (sole discretion of the judge, 8 years on average): incurs \\"infliction of educational measures\\". A distinction must be made between children younger than 10 and those aged 10‚Äì13 subject to educational sanctions, controversial measures since they sit at the border between penalty and education. * Minor aged 13 to 16: Beyond educational measures the legal system tends to consider their responsibility attenuated and they incur only half of the common-law penalty, which cannot exceed 20 years of incarceration. and 7,500 in fines. * Minor aged 16 to 18: also has the benefit of the excuse of minority, but it can in principle be withdrawn in cases of a second repeat offense of specific offenses, or when \\"the circumstances of the case and the personality of the minor warrant this\\" (\\"lorsque les circonstances de l'esp√®ce et la personnalit√© du mineur le justifient\\"Ainsi, dans l'Affaire Ghofrane Haddaoui, un cas de lapidation en 2004, l'excuse de minorit√© a √©t√© refus√©e, et les auteurs condamn√©s √† 23 ans de prison, voir ¬´ Les 2 meurtriers de Ghofrane condamn√©s √† 23 ans de prison ¬ª , 15 avril 2007, Le Nouvel Observateur.). = Responsibility of leaders and deciders = To ensure that certain legal and regulatory provisions are complied with, legislators have over the 20th century accompanied them with penal sanctions. Generally these have been obstructive offenses destined to prevent serious damage, for example in the case of hygiene and workplace security, of the environment, finance, union rights a collective framework: regulation of some economic activities, of paid work, of public open spaces. For an infraction to be described as preventive it should not so much incriminate the damaging behavior as the omission of a behavior that is required by law. How to impute a crime of omission to a person while respecting the principle of personal responsibility? An offender will, logically, be a person that regulation had exhorted to act, only the person who has an obligation to act can be reproached with not acting. Some legal obligations to act weigh individually on every citizen: assistance to persons in danger, refraining from homicides and wounding through carelessness. Others have the specific trait of not being possible to be committed except in a social framework: regulation of certain economic activities, of salaried work, of public spaces. The law addresses an injunction to leaders and decision- makers of the collective: whether corporate president, mayor of a municipality, chairman of the general council or manager of a business, the decision-maker must use his powers to monitor the respect of laws in place, either by obeying legal obligations or by monitoring the compliance of his subordinates. If the moral element of the infraction no doubt belongs to the person who commits it, since the delegate has no autonomy, the perception of the material element is more problematic. If the decider had respected the law, he would have ordered the subordinate to act or not to act in a certain way; he would not have respected the restrictions of regulation but he would have had them respected by a subaltern. When they have not been respected the decision-maker appears not as a material author of the infraction but as a moral author, almost an accomplice. Often applied to infractions of omission, nonetheless, the distinction between a material author and one who simply had an offending desire is tenuous. This is why one can reproach the director who was to respect and enforce the applicable rules of failing to do so. If the infraction was apparently committed by a third subordinate, the decider is indeed responsible for not having acted. This responsibility of the decider does not violate the principle of responsibility for personal actions. It also does not exonerate the subordinate of his own responsibility if the elements of an infraction can be imputed to him. As well, the decider in principle must submit proof of his absence of fault, even if this proof would in practice be difficult to produce: the decider is assumed to know the rules that apply to his activity and is most often blamed for not respecting them or ensuring they are respected. Example: a mayor is personally guilty of favoritism because he set the agenda and presided over the meeting of the municipal council that violated legal restrictions (Crim. 19 novembre 2003). When the decision-maker in fact is not the decision-maker in law, the Court of cassation adopts a solution similar to that of the civil jurisdictions in similar circumstances: the decision-makers are co-authors of the infraction, and each can be pursued as if he were the only decider (Crim. 12 septembre 2000). The judicial administrator of a company, invested with the powers of the executive, also assumes his responsibility and qualities. It has nonetheless appeared that in large hierarchies the decider is not in practice responsible for the entirety of the business' activities. Worse, the decider cannot materially meet all the obligations that weigh on him: the head of an enterprise should constantly pay heed that safety instructions are being followed by workers, the rules of accounting and billing by the accounting department, labor laws are followed by the personnel office, and the rules of sanitation by the maintenance and upkeep departments‚Ä¶ it does not seem either just or opportune to impute to him an infraction when the power of decision lay with a third party. This is the mechanism of delegation of power.  Delegation of power  The criminal responsibility of the decision-maker is tied to the powers he holds over the functioning of the enterprise: these are the powers which allow him to be reproached with not acting, or with allowing an infraction to be committed. One cannot disassociate this responsibility from the qualities of the powers of the decision-maker. As a result, the delegation of power also carries with it onto this third party the attendant criminal responsibility. This logical solution was endorsed by the Cour de cassation from the very start of the 20th century (28 juin 1902). Delegation of power is a consensual act between a delegating decision-maker and a delegatee subordinate; writing is useful only as proof. One can imagine subdelegations with the same conditions of dans les m√™mes conditions of validity and effectiveness as the initial delegation. On the other hand, any co-delegation is ruled out: the delegate must enjoy an autonomy and power incompatible with the collective exercise of delegation. La validity and effectiveness of the delegation of powers depend on several criteria brought out in the case law: a. Delegation only exonerates of the responsibility in that capacity: in no case can a decider who personally took part in the consummation of an infraction avail himself of delegation. The decision-maker who personally takes part in the infraction is responsible for his personal actions and like any material author of the infraction he can be punished. Only the responsibility incurred by failing to fulfil the obligations specifically incumbent on his functions can benefit from delegation of powers. Example : Crim. 17 septembre 2002, aggressive sales strategies, an element of fraud, remain imputable to the decision-maker despite the delegation of power, since he conceived and organized the strategies himself. b. Delegation of powers is made necessary by the structure of the enterprise: only the decision-maker who cannot effectively assume his legal obligations can delegate his responsibilities to a third party. The mechanism of delegation of powers is not a means for the decision-maker to escape his criminal responsibility, but a mechanism to assure the effectiveness of legal limitations. It's when the scale or material organization of an enterprise do not allow a decision-maker to confront his obligations that delegation of power is authorized and even desirable. In the same spirit delegation cannot be general but must concern a precise sector of activity. This special character the delegation is strictly interpreted by judges. Example: Crim. 14 octobre 2003, the delegation of power in hygiene and security to an administrator, president of the Committee of Hygiene Security and Work Conditions (CHSCT), the mandated committee in every workplace, does not transfer the responsibility for not consulting CHSCT: an interference has been committed by the company decision-maker. The Court of Cassation seems to distinguish \\"technical\\" delegation in matters of hygiene and security, concrete, and a delegation of judicial or administrative obligations tied to the functioning of the CHSCT. c. The delegate is a member of the enterprise provided with the competence, authority, and necessary means: the decision- maker must designate one of his subordinates or possibly the head of a daughter organization in a group of companies who has the technical competence, authority and material means permitting him, in practice, to bring to a successful conclusion the mission assigned to him by the delegation. These conditions are to avoid fictitious delegations. For a subordinate to assume the criminal responsibility attached to certain responsibilities, the decision-maker must have put him in a position to effectively ensure the respect of the law. The decider who proceeds to a judicial delegation without effectively transmitting his powers will remain responsible in that capacity for the delegated matter. The finding of the existence and regularity of a delegation of powers assures stems from the sovereign power of lower-court judges, who often show themselves rather severe with deciders, distrusting fictive delegations: Crim 10 septembre 2002, for example, in a matter of asbestos which finds the general delegation of organization and supervision of construction site safety. The effect of this responsibility in that capacity associated to the mechanism of the delegation of power is to give decision- makers a real duty to delegate their responsibilities as soon as they cannot assume them themselves, which ensures an maximum effectiveness of the regulation of their activity.  RPPM  To trigger the criminal responsibility of a corporation as author, the infraction must have been committed on behalf of the corporation by its agent or representative. It's the mechanism for criminal responsibility by ricochet. The corporation is not considered in criminal law as an autonomous person endowed with his or her power of decision and methods of action, but rather an abstract person incarnated by its representatives or agents. RPPM is a mechanism that imputes to the corporation the offenses of one or more physical persons: the representative or the agent, in other words persons with the legal, statutory of conventional power to engage the corporation, and notably the delegate of a representative with the ability, authority and means necessary to perform this mission. An infraction committed by a stranger to the corporation, and sometimes by acts foreign to the scope of representation, or a crime which is not committed on behalf of the corporation (i.e. in its interest or in its name) cannot be imputed to it. Imputation of an infraction to a corporation supposes the elements of the crime are present, and is more often done to physical people √† une personne morale suppose la r√©union de tous les √©l√©ments de l'infraction, le plus souvent sur la t√™te d'une personne physique identifi√©e, organe ou repr√©sentant de la personne morale. Les juges ne peuvent en aucun cas √©tablir l'existence des √©l√©ments de l'infraction directement dans le chef de la personne morale (Crim. 29 avril 2003). A finding of non- responsibility for a representative or an agent in theory prevents the prosecution of corporations, even, it seems, in the case of a subjective cause of non-responsibility, a personal attributes of the agent such as demential, even though the solution is unclear in law. A corporation constitutes an autonomous entity with a different judicial personality from that of its constituent parts. As, in theory, nothing allows applying to a person a subjective cause of non-responsibility applicable to a third party, il ne semble pas opportun de contrevenir √† ce m√©canisme dans l'hypoth√®se d'une personne morale, sauf √† rompre l'√©galit√© des justiciables devant la loi p√©nale. The disappearance of the corporation naturally puts an end to prosecution, this even in the case of merger or acquisition. The principle of responsibility for personal actions runs counter to the acquiring entity or person of responsibility for infractions committed by the acquired business (Crim. 14 octobre 2003).  Causes of criminal non-responsibility  If the author of an infraction has a cause for a finding of non-responsibility, he will not be condemned due to his absence of responsibility, even if the facts that constitute the infraction are established and guilt recognized. Doctrine, like jurisprudence, operates a distinction that does not appear in the penal code among the objective causes of not-responsible findings, or justifying facts, or the subjective causes of non-responsibility, or non-imputability. = Objective causes of non-responsibility (justifying facts) = Objective causes of penal non-responsibility, also called justifying facts, erase the punishable nature of the act. The impunity of the principal actor extends thereafter to the accomplice as well as the corporation. Justifying facts are of three types: *authorisation of the law, or order from a legitimate authority (article 122-4 *legitimate defense (articles 122-5 et 122-6 ) *state of necessity (article 122-7).  Authorisation of the law, order from a legitimate authority  The authorisation of law or regulation reveals a contradiction between a criminal law text and another law text, whether it contains civil, administrative or penal law. Authorisation of regulation can only justify regulatory contraventions and not violations of criminal law, as much because of the hierarchy of norms as because of the separation of the executive, legislative and judicial powers. The liberal principle would have us believe that interdiction is always the exception when it comes to liberty, so authorisation in law must always weigh heavier than the prohibitions of a different law of the same type (valeur=value). The most recent applications of the justifying facts concern use of force by the police and by the gendarmerie, medical acts, which are not qualified as violent if they are the acts of physicians and have a therapeutic motive. Also article 73 of the Code of penal procedure, which allows any citizen to arrest the author of a crime or misdemeanor punishable by a sentence of imprisonment, and to restrain that person until police arrive. On January 5, 2000, the Cour de cassation indicated that the justifying facts defense of authorization under law extends to involuntary infractions committed in the course of the execution of an act authorized by law, for example, clumsiness of a gendarme caused the death of the person he was lawfully pursuing. This assumes, of course that the criteria to apply that authorization to the given situation were all in place, and that it was absolutely necessary for example for the gendarme to use his weapon, Crim. 18 February 2003. This decision confirms that authorisation of law is not a subjective cause of non-responsibility; authorization does not make the moral element disappear, or else imprudence would remain punishable. Authorisation under low can only cover exactly the facts detailed as authorized in the legislation. Also, the duty de cohabitation which mandates spouses to maintain sexual relations doesn't authorize one of them to impose sexual relations on the other. The right to arrest and restrain the author of a flagrant misdemeanor does not permit molesting, searching or questioning him before the polica arrive. Nor does an administrative notice, or autorisation to perfourrm an activity justify a violation of criminal law. Apparently the administrative authorities do not have the power to allow a behavior to escape from the scope of criminal law. The Cour de cassation has found that the duty to assist a person in danger described in article 223-6 of the Code p√©nal did not justify the assistance given a miscreant by a nurse, once the services provided to him went beyond strictly necessary assistance required by the endangerment of the miscreant (Crim. 17 septembre 2003). √Ä l'autorisation de la loi, il convient d'associer la coutume qui permet des atteintes l√©g√®res √† la personne humaine sans que leur auteur puisse √™tre inqui√©t√© : ainsi, le droit de correction des parents sur leur enfant, la pratique de sports violents ou la possibilit√© de r√©aliser des piercings et ou des tatouages sans √™tre poursuivi pour violences volontaires.  Legitimate defense  Legitimate defense is provided by article 122-5 of the penal code. This justifying fact benefits the person who, faced with an unjust and current attack against a person or a good, carries out a necessary, simultaneous and proportionate act in defense of that person or that good. The elements of a legitimate defense are as follows: * an unjust attack against oneself, others, or an asset. The unjust nature of the attack notably excludes legitimate violence like a policeman trying to protect the public order, or licit behaviours like confisating GMO corn. * A concurrent attack, in other words, fighting back at the time of the attack. It is impossible to avail oneself of a legitimate defense argument for an act of vengeance, for example where a victim fires at an aggressor who is already running away. On the other hand, a defense prepared in advance (setting traps, electric fences) is valid as long as the defensive measures do not execute until there is an actual attack. * necessary retaliation: in other words, to counter the attack, commission of an illicit act is necessary; there is no legal alternative to the retaliation. * a response proportionate to the attack: the value sacrificed must be less than the value protected; the reply must engender a lower social cost than if the attack had been carried out. Jurisprudence has been able to clarify the conditions for laying a legitimate defense argument. The actual and unjust character of the attack poses no serious application problem. When the attack is an action of a public authority, its injustice may be perceived in cases of manifest illegality (beatings and night raids). The necessary and proportionate character of the response is itself subject to the assessment of lower-court juges, and in function of the entirety of the circumstances of fact. The Court of Cassation decisions of 6 December 1995 et 21 February 1996 reveal a victim seized by the collar found guilty for having responded with blows from sharp claws but recognized as a legitimate defense for shooting a bullet into heart of the aggressor. In many affairs that take place at night, it can be seen that determining the necessary and proportionate character of the response does not depend on the reality of the aggression, but rather on its gravity as perceived by the author of the riposte. Rather than ponder the balance of interests that are really in play, the penal judge asks himself whether a reasonable person placed in the same situation would have reacted in the same way. This subjective approach, which can lead to a finding of an admissibility for a purely putative claim of legitimate defense, in reaction to an imaginary aggression, explains the refusal to justify as legitimate defense involuntary infractions. A prudent man can control his actions and responds in a proportionate manner to an aggression of which he is victim; he will not commit any imprudent or negligeant acts bringing about the wounding or death of his aggressor. This approach also justifies denying the benefit of legitimate defense to one who does not know he is in a defensive position: for example, a person who joins a brawl for the pleasure of fighting and who by chance becomes part of a group of victims in a state of legitimate defense. Legitimate defense would protect someone who while committing an illicit act does not commit a fault, or who reveals his lack of social dangerousness.  Necessity  A state of necessity is a true justifying fact, which covers even involuntary infractions: Crim. 16 juillet 1986 found a gendarme not criminally responsible for a bullet shot into the ground because he needed to intimidate someone, which wounded that person in a ricochet. The determining criteria for the state of necessity to enter into play may be the balance between the protected interest and the sacrificed interest, as two arrests in the criminal chamber on May 11, 2004 . In this case (appeal n¬∞ 03-80.254), the guilty verdict of trial court judges of Sangachali-Duvanni on theft charges was overturned because the fraudulently-seized documents were to be used to defend of the accused in litigation with her employer. The upper court (Haute jurisdiction) effectively found that on the one hand the strictly necessary character of the documents to the defense of the prosecuted person was not researched by the lower-court judges, given that the theft of the documents was carried out only in the intention of \\"legitimately preserving proofs\\" in the context of a lawsuit. The appeals court confirmed the same day in another case (appeal n¬∞ 03-85.521) the acquittal of a person prosecuted on a charge of theft. = Subjective causes of non-responsibility (non-imputability) =  Coercion  Coercion is the penal equivalent of force majeure. It is an irresistible force. As in civil law, a debate exists concerning unforeseeability‚Äîis this a condition for the implementation of the idea or is it a corollary of irresistibility, foreseeable events being by nature resistible? The criminal chamber has required that the constraint be unforeseeable and irresistible. The law, however, mentions only irresistibility. Coercion can be physical or moral; the important criteria are its irresistible characture and its causal tie to the crime. Coercion is a cause of non-imputability, but it must have abolished the discernment of the victim to be taken into account. This could take the form of a natural disaster of an illness of the actor: a driver who becomes unwell due to an illness he did not know he had, exonerates him of all criminal responsibility for the consequences of the accident he may have caused. The classical example of a moral coercion is coercion which results from pressure or blackmail which has abolished the discernment of the victim. The Court of cassation has been able to find that the alleged pressure of the German authorities on the person of Maurice Papon did not abolish his free will and he, therefore, remained responsible for his complicity in crimes against humanity (Crim. 23 janvier 1997). The coercion will not be taken into account if results from a fault or an imprudence of the person who acts. Thus, a person who knows himself subject to unwellness but who drives anyway, or who dozes off after starting a trip in an advanced state of fatigue, are responsible for homicide or involuntary wounding if they cause an accident.  Legal error  \\"Nemo censetur ignorare legem\\" (None should be ignorant of the law): the adage supplies a legal fiction (not a presumption or simple proof) which is necessary to the functions of all judicial systems. Law rests on its compulsory character and one cannot envisage a judicial system in which individuals could avail themshelves of their ignorance of the law to escape its application. When the penal code was reformed the lawmakers attempted to satisfy the imperatives of clarity and accessibility and list possible infractions hors code, outside the code, in the fifth book of the penal code. It appears that it was impossible to enumerate the entirety of the offenses extant and active in French law, but their numbers are estimated at 10,000. This impossibility to know the exact contours of criminal law has led legislators to attenuate the fiction of knowledge of law by the introduction of error of law as a cause of non- responsibility. Article 122-3 of the penal code provides for the non- responsibility of a person who can prove having believed, by an error of law he could not avoid, that he could legitimately carry out the action in question. It is not so much a matter of proving one's ignorance of criminal law as it is of proving one's belief in the legality of the action in question. The Court of Cassation has applied this cause of non-responsibility in a very restricted manner, finding for example that the error on the scope of a court decision caused by the legal counsel of the party is not necessarily an invincible defense, since the judge could be asked to interpret it (Crim. 11 octobre 1995). It has equally found that a company which had expanded its market after a (minist√©riel) indicated that it did not need an authorization had not committed an invincible error, because it could have consulted qualified jurists (Crim. 19 mars 1997). It later formulated the principle that simple advice from a law professional does not constitute an error of law (Crim. 7 janvier 2004). The court has accepted the non- responsibility of a head of an enterprise who merely applies a collective bargaining agreement signed under the aegis of a mediator designated by the government (Crim. 24 novembre 1998). This cause of non-responsibility is used more widely by lower courts, generally censured by the Court of cassation, due to equity concerns. For example, the Paris Court of Appeals held that the mismatch between the case law of the business and criminal chambers of the Court of cassation as to the legality of the documents photocopied by employees in order to produce them in justice had led the employee to an error of law preventing a guilty verdict for theft (CA Paris, 9 novembre 2000, Crim.11 mai 2004). Beyond these three subjective causes of non-responsibility, immunities exist that stem from the personal qualities of the defendant, such as the application of Article 311-12 of the Code p√©nal, immunity of spouses, ascendant et descendant in matters of theft. Such immunities are personal causes of non-responsibility which do not apply to the accomplice or to the corporation; they are nonetheless not the same as a lack of moral elements and in this they approach the objective causes of non-responsibility.  Mental disturbance or dementia  Article 122-1 of the Code p√©nal says that a person \\"afflicted at the moment in question by a psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that abolishes his discernment or his control of his actions\\" will not be found criminally responsible. Depending on the moment when the psychic or neuropsychic trouble declared itself, the person's charges could be dismissed by the juge d'instruction, or receive an acquittal or not-guilty verdict in the trial court. If the person is considered a danger to society because of his mental disturbance, he can be committed to a mental institution. The prefect (pr√©fet) decides what to do with the person in this case.  Criminal responsibility of French politicians  = Parliamentarians = In France, deputies and senators have parliamentary immunity which comes down to non-responsibility (fundamental immunity) and inviolability (immunity of procedure). = Local elected officials = Local elected officials in 1974 gained a jurisdictional privilege, notably prefects and magistrates. Instituted following the 5/7 dance hall fire and the subsequent sentencing of then-mayor of Saint-Laurent-du-Pont, which made a powerful impression on the political class. This privilege allowed the investigation of crimes and misdemeanors of elected officials in another jurisdiction than their own, to avoid any partiality on the part of the judge, and was abolished with the reform of the penal code in 1993. The implementation of decentralization has led to significant growth in 20-some years of the body of standards (more than 5,000 texts spread through 18 Codes) to which elected officials are subject, sometimes without having the means, especially in small municipalities, of applying them in practice. The areas of urban design, the environment, and the security of the financial markets are so many \\"infraction niches\\". Also, legislators have created unintentional misdemeanors, a straying from the principle that says \\"there is no crime of offence without the intention of committing it\\" (art. 121-3 of penal code). Finally, in the context of an economic crisis and of competition between towns to attract businesses, some mayors have been brought to make perilous judicial combinations (montages). Mayors may have felt like the \\"scapegoats of proximity democracy,\\" in the words of Senator Hubert Haenel, forced to limit their initiatives. So legislation therefore attempted to better frame the phenomenon, notably with the Fauchon law of July 10, 2000, on unintended misdemeanors (‚Ä¶).Marie- Christine Steckel, ¬´ Plaidoyer pour une d√©p√©nalisation des fautes non intentionnelles des √©lus locaux ¬ª, Revue juridique ‚Äì Droit prospectif, 2002, no 1, pp. 427‚Äì447 Deputy √âtienne Mourrut introduced a law concerning the criminal liability of elected local officials in sports or cultural demonstrations.

Childhood and World War II  Eugene Hlywa was born in 1925, in Nosiv village, Ternopil region, Ukraine. His parents Maria n√©e Lutsiv and Leonid Hlywa brought up Eugene and his elder brother Teofil in the spirit of Ukrainian nationalism that was so symbolic of the Ukrainian conscientious society at the beginning of 20th century. In his teenage years Eugene Hlywa joined the UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army). During the Second World War as a member of OUN (Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists), Eugene Hlywa initially performed duties of an ideological advisor, and then of intelligence agent and soldier. In 1943 Eugene Hlywa was captured by the enemy. The German military court sentenced him to execution by firing squad, which was to take place within 24 hours. Initially he was awaiting for his execution in Rzesz√≥w prison, then was transferred to Dƒôbica detention center and subsequently to Montelupich Prison in Krak√≥w. The death sentence was replaced by incarceration in concentration camps. Eugene Hlywa was an inmate at such ill-famed Nazi concentration camps as: Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen and Ebensee. Eugene Hlywa was freed from Ebensee concentration camp on 5 May 1945 along with other inmates by the US army. Shortly after his release Eugene Hlywa returned to his OUN activities. His division was responsible for prevention of Moscow's secret services capturing and forcible exportation of the USSR citizens, who became political prisoners and refugees during the war back to the USSR. In 1947, Yaroslav Stetsko, the OUN and ABN (Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations) leader, entrusted Eugene Hlywa with organising the ABN intelligence division, which he headed until disbanding of ABN in 1996 following the dissolution of the USSR. Along with political activities Eugene Hlywa continued his education. He studied law and political sciences in the UFU (Ukrainian Free University) in Munich. He published newspaper articles under pseudonyms and participated in the community, student and religious life.Boltivets, S. 2016, Lifelong theory of hypnosis Eugene Hlywa in Psychology and Society, 15 June 2016 On migrating to Australia, for two years Eugene Hlywa worked in the remote regions of Western Australia, to comply with one of the requirements of the Immigration Department contract.  Life in Australia  In Australia Eugene Hlywa actively participated in establishing the foundation of the organised Ukrainian community life in Australia. Thus, thanks to his and his friends' efforts, the Ukrainian Saturday school, music society and drama club, were established. He was a co- organiser and the Head of the Ukrainian Association of Sefton, Bass Hill and Chester Hill suburbs (two terms). He was the head of the building committee of the Monastery of St. Basil the Great in Sydney. He was also the founder and head of the inter-confessional committee of ‚ÄúProtection of Faith and Religion in Ukraine‚Äù. He was the organiser and head of the committee for preparations of the celebration of 1000-th anniversary of Christianisation of Ukraine. In 1951 Eugene Hlywa married Lydia n√©e Kreitzburg. Lydia, who was originally from Kyiv, was able to continue her career as a medical doctor in Australia. Lydia Hlywa died in 1993. In 1952 the Hlywas moved to Sydney. Eugene Hlywa worked as a lawyer and studied medicine. He chose to specialise in psychology. The reviewers of his doctoral dissertation The Problem of a Personality in the Light of Modern Psychotherapy and the Unconscious were professors Volodymyr Yaniv, Olexander von Kulchytsky and Stanislav Kratohvil. Since then Eugene Hlywa dedicated himself to psychotherapy and hypnotherapy. In addition to his private practice and supervision of young professionals Eugene Hlywa also taught. Thus in 1975 he was invited to lecture Psychotherapy and Hypnotherapy at the two-year courses conducted by the Australian Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, now known as The Australian Society of Hypnosis. Eugene Hlywa briefly worked at the Jung Institute (Switzerland), and frequently participated at a number national and international conferences and congresses in the USA including Harvard, Philadelphia, Southern Californian University, Germany, at Munich, Salzburg, in Lindau and also in Milan. At the International Society of Hypnosis and Psychosomatic Medicine Congress in Philadelphia, Doctor Eugene Hlywa presented a resolution, in which he accused the USSR for misusing psychiatry for political purposes. He also discussed this topic in his Master‚Äôs thesis ‚ÄúPsychotherapy in the Western World and USSR‚Äù.

Biography  The son of the actor Jean Baptiste M√©tra, Olivier M√©tra began his career at a very early age with his father. In 1842, he made his debut at the Th√©√¢tre Comte. In addition, he learned the violin and played from the age of 19 years in a ball of Boulevard de Rochechouart. On the advice of an orchestra musician, he followed the lessons of Antoine Elwart at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he obtained a first prize of harmony. From 1855 he conducted the orchestra of the Bal Mabille. During this period he acquired great popularity thanks to waltzes such as Le Tour du Monde, la Valse des Roses, Gambrinus, and La Nuit La s√©r√©nade. From 1872 to 1877, he conducted the bals of the Op√©ra-Comique, the orchestra of the Folies Berg√®re for which he composed several ballets, including Les Volontaires. From 1874 to 1876, he directed the bals of the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels and, finally, the along with Johann Strauss II. In 1879, he gave the ballet Yedda, on a choreography by M√©rante, premiered 17 January 1879. In 1885, he established at Palais Vivienne the \\"soir√©es Metra\\" which consisted of promenade concerts, dances and parties on Wednesday and Saturday evenings. In 1888, he created at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes- Parisiens his operetta Le Mariage avant la lettre on a libretto by Adolphe Jaime and Georges Duval. In addition to his waltzes and operettas, M√©tra made numerous arrangements of other operettas by composers such as Jacques Offenbach, √âmile T√©desco, Louis Ganne, Robert Planquette, Charles Lecocq, Edmond Audran and L√©on Vasseur. Some of his compositions are used as film music in, among others, Ciboulette, by Claude Autant-Lara (1930) and Sentimental Destinies by Olivier Assayas (2000). Of all French composers of his style and his time, he was one of the most popular. Everyone knew his waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and quadrilles. Monument at Bois-le-roi. Olivier M√©tra is buried at Bois-le-Roi, his monumental tomb is adorned with a bust by Antonin Merci√©. Marcel Proust alludes to Valse des roses by Olivier M√©tra in Swann's way.

Horace Newte, or the perils of authorship. LDHS Newsletter, 2003 No. 158 p1,2 http://www.theydon.org.uk/lhs/Downloads/LHS%20158.pdf The Newte family, with somewhat of a roaming history, returned to London living at Hammersmith just as London's suburbs were swelling with new housing and new railways. These subjects were to feature in Newte's popular novels. He was educated at Christ's Hospital. His first play, a comedietta, was performed in 1889 as a fundraiser for the Iffley Hall, Hammersmith.Amateurs at Hammersmith. The Era (London, England), Saturday, 15 June 1889; Issue 2647. British Library Newspapers, Part I: 1800-1900. The first of Newte's published novels was The Master Beast: being a true account of the ruthless tyranny inflicted on the British people by socialism 1888-2020 (1907), a novel indicative of Newte's distastes and his enmity to contemporaries such as George Bernard Shaw who identified themselves as Socialists.The Pall Mall Gazette (London, England), Saturday, 17 January 1891; Issue 8059. British Library Newspapers, Part I: 1800-1900. Some of Newte's other novels inclined towards a 'romantic' form one such title was his A Young Lady, a study in selectness (1913). Other novels had singular plots, including in the example of The Home of the Seven Devils (1913), in which a Catholic friar is required by his Order to renounce his vows; and, in Calico Jack (1910), a study of the murky aspects of life in the music halls. Sparrows (1909), perhaps one of his most famous and popular romance titles, was made into a film in the Netherlands and entitled \\"Vogelvrij\\".Binger, Maurits (Director) 1916. Vogelurij (Sparrows).

His last play, A Stroke of Business, jointly written with his Loughton neighbour and friend, Arthur Morrison, was performed in 1907. In the 1920s and 1930s, Newte's output was predominately of journalism. His penultimate novel, Whither? A story of the drift age (1922) and his final novel, House Sinister (1930) were produced eight years apart. Newte became a regular contributor for the Daily Mirror and various provincial newspapers. His articles were characterised by his objections to the numerous aspects of contemporary life of which he disapproved. He married Vera Von [sic] Rasch in 1898. Moving from west London to Essex, they lived in a variety of ancient houses including Moat Farm at Upminster Common, and Alderton Hall in Loughton.Pond, Chris 'The Buildings of Loughton and notable people of the town' 2nd edition LDHS 2008 They had one child, a daughter, who died in infancy.Gray, Imogen P \\"Clues in Fiction: an Essex couple's secret ties\\" Loughton, Alderton Press 2017 The couple divorced in 1916.

The published inventory describes jewels and silver-plate belonging to Elizabeth I of England with detailed references to other source material. Introduction The sources used by Collins were British Library Harley MS 1560 and Stowe MS 555. The manuscripts represent the \\"Quenis Majesties juelles plate and other stuff\\" in 1574 and additions by gift or purchase over the next 20 years which were kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. Collins also collated information from other books and manuscripts to cross-reference information about the objects listed. Gifts of plate to the queen passed from the Privy Chamber to the Jewel House. Some pieces were melted down and others were given as diplomatic gifts. When the queen travelled, the towns she visited often gave her gifts of silver-gilt cups. In 1574 the office of the Jewel House was located in a two-storey building on the south side of the White Tower. This contained the records of the jewels and packing materials for sending jewels to court.Collins, pp. 3, 35. The 1574 inventory was made John Astley, Master and Treasurer of the Jewel House. The Master had an annual salary of ¬£50 and was able to exact payments from goldsmiths appointed to work for the Jewel House, and those who transported plate from the House to diplomats. The post was lucrative, but some of the perquisites of the role were exaggerated or overstated by Sir Gilbert Talbot, who was made Master in 1660 and in 1680 wrote a treatise entitled Of the Jewel house.Collins, pp. 223‚Äì5: Archaeologia, XII, pp. 115‚Äì23: British Library Add. 34359: Several other copies of Talbot's treatise survive in manuscript. In the inventory the items were listed in categories; below an outline of the main categories is given with some examples of the 1,605 entries. Other inventories of the Queen's jewels On 12 January 1604 the goldsmiths William Herrick and John Spilman were asked to assess and make an inventory of jewels that had belonged to Queen Elizabeth. King James had already given many pieces to the queen, Princess Elizabeth, and Arbella Stuart and others. The remaining jewels had been transferred from the keeping of Mrs Mary Radcliffe or Ratcliffe, former gentlewoman to Queen Elizabeth, to the Countess of Suffolk.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar State Papers James I: 1603-1610 (London, 1857), p. 66 citing TNA SP14/6/9. A list of jewels in the possession of Anne of Denmark in 1606 was published by Diana Scarisbrick.Diana Scarisbrick, 'Anne of Denmark's Jewellery Inventory', Archaeologia, vol. CIX (1991), pp. 193‚Äì237. The manuscript is kept by the National Library of Scotland. During the reign of James other lists of jewels were made, including those annexed to the crown in 1606, and those sent to Spain in 1623 at the time of the Spanish Match. These were printed in Thomas Rymer's Foedera. In December 1607 Spilman, Herrick, and the goldsmith John Williams were asked to polish and amend some pieces that Queen Elizabeth had mortgaged, and King James gave Anna of Denmark a cup made of unicorn horn, a gold ewer, a salt with a branch from which serpent's tongues and sapphires were suspended, and a crystal chess board with crystal and topaz chessmen.Frederick Devon, Issues of the Exchequer during the Reign of James I (London, 1836), pp. 305-6. The unicorn horn cup, the ewer, and the gold salt were listed in the inventory of Anna of Denmark.Diana Scarisbrick, 'Anne of Denmark's Jewellery Inventory', Archaeologia, vol.

Gambacorti was born to rich merchants and was left a widow after a brief marriage. She escaped a second marriage after becoming a professed religious despite her father's fierce resistance. Her beatification received ratification from Pope Pius VIII on 4 March 1830 after her local 'cultus' received confirmation. Life Vittoria Gambacorti was born in the Republic of Venice in 1362 to Pietro Gambacorti, a rich merchant who was sent into political exile that year. In 1369 political circumstances of Pisan politics saw them relocate to Pisa where her father was appointed as chief magistrate. Gambacorti was a pious child who seemed to be destined for an arranged marriage that would bring with it numerous political advantages not for her benefit but rather for the benefit of her father and brothers. She accepted this as the will of her father and was married to Simone Massa in 1374. Sometime after this her father met with Catherine of Siena to discuss politics and Catherine met with Gambacorti and offered her both advice and encouragement on being a good wife and above all a dedicated Christian. Her time as a wife was cut short when her husband died of the plague in 1377 and despite her happiness as a wife she was more than reluctant to enter marriage again, though aware that her father was negotiating another marriage for her. Not long after the death of her husband she received a letter from Catherine who exhorted her to follow her faith. The frightened girl fled her home and sought refuge with the Poor Clares at their convent of Santa Croce, taking \\"Chiara\\" as her religious name . Her brother found her and removed her from the convent so that the arranged marriage could go ahead. Her father locked her in a dark room and kept her isolated from her friends, and from church life. But with the aid of her mother she managed to smuggle jewels out from her room to friends so the proceeds of the jewels could be used for the poor, while her mother smuggled her out to Mass on one occasion when her father and brothers were not at home. Her father asked a visiting Spanish bishop ‚Äì a former confessor to Bridget of Sweden ‚Äì to persuade her to accept his views. But the bishop went against this and encouraged Gambacorti to pursue her call to the religious life, giving her father no other choice but to allow her to leave home. She had spent from 29 June 1376 to 30 November as her father's captive. Gambacorti did not return to the Poor Clares but entered the Order of Preachers, inspired by Catherine's example; she made her profession in December 1378. The convent she joined was weak in its observance to the rule of Dominic of Osma so she ‚Äì who favored a strict and rigorous implementation ‚Äì arranged with her new stepmother for a new convent to be built. At the beginning of 1377 her father welcomed Pope Gregory XI in Livorno, when the pontiff was moving back from Avignon to Rome, and her father began work on a new church to celebrate the pontiff's return. The church of San Domenico was constructed in 1385 ‚Äì at her father's orders ‚Äì adjacent to her convent and she moved into the new convent completed on 29 August 1382. Gambacorti knew Marie Mancini around this time. On 21 October 1392 thugs murdered Giovanni Lanfranchi and his son and sought refuge at the home of Jacopo d'Appiano who was plotting an insurrection against Gambacorti's father. Then her father was chased by this mob and killed with several blows of a sword and dagger in the street outside her convent. Two of his sons (Lorenzo and Benedetto) were attacked in the fight as well. Benedetto died in the skirmish but Lorenzo was wounded and rushed to the convent, pleading with his sister for refuge. She refused him due to her earlier familial memories and allowed him to die in the streets. After it seemed that she would die she asked for food to be sent to her from the home of her father's murderer and the man's wife obliged, after which the man was killed. The widow and her daughters were then allowed to reside in the convent. Gambacorti died in Pisa on 17 April 1420 and a legend stated that when one of the sisters at her convent was at the verge of death her bones would rattle in her coffin. Beatification Her beatification received confirmation on 4 March 1830 from Pope Pius VIII after he confirmed the late nun's longstanding local 'cultus' (or popular devotion).

Smaller remnants occur in the eastern section of the Cumberland Subregion. On 10 May 2002 the NSW Government gazetted the forest as a critically Endangered Ecological Community under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995; and on 17 March 2015 the forest was listed as Critically Endangered by the Australian Government under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.  Description The forest is dominated by broad-leaved Ironbark (Eucalyptus fibrosa) and Paperbark (Melaleuca decora). The main threat is further clearing for development, as well as weed invasion, inappropriate fire regime, damage from vehicles, and impacts from surrounding development. Fencing also prevents wildlife movement and increases injuries and deaths. There is also the potential of clay/shale extraction. The forest's canopy includes Eucalyptus resinifera, Syncarpia glomulifera, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Acacia parramattensis, Melaleuca nodosa, Melaleuca decora and Casuarina glauca. The smaller trees include Acacia longifolia, Bursaria spinosa, Solanum aviculare and Polyscias sambucifolia.

Francis Spaight became infamous for an incident of cannibalism, which occurred after the ship broached to off the coast of Canada on December 3, 1836 in a snow storm, washing away all the provisions and fouling the water stores. Of the 18 crewmen, three were thrown overboard during the accident and 15 survived, including four young crewmen in their teens.Simpson 1994 p.130 With only rain water and bottles of wine, the crewmen endured severe cold, dehydration and hunger until December 18, when the captain suggested they sacrifice one of the four young crewmen to survive. The captain justified exclusion of other older crewmen by the fact that they had families depending on them. The four boys cast lots and Patrick O'Brien, a fifteen year old cabin boy, drew the death lot. Captain ordered the cook to kill O'Brien; the cook initially refused but was later forced to do so by the captain. However, the cook failed in killing O'Brien. O'Brien attempted to kill himself by cutting his own wrist, but his attempt also failed. In the end, the captain resorted to cutting O'Brien's throat, at which point O'Brien resisted but was killed. The surviving crewmen cannibalised O'Brien for three days until the 20th, when an adult crewman, Michael Behane, and another cabin boy, George Burns, became deranged from dehydration and hunger.Simpson 1994 p.132 They were also cannibalised, in addition to another crewman who died on the same day. When the surviving crewmen were about to draw another lot for cannibalism, they were spotted by the American vessel Agenoria. The crewmen were waving hands and feet of cannibalised victims to express their plight. After being stranded for twenty days, 11 crewmen survived out of 18. Three died due to the snow storm, and four had been cannibalised. Aboard the Agenoria, the survivors were so emaciated and malnourished that they couldn't feed themselves without help.

There are 14 Shaiva Upanishads in the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads. They, along with other minor Upanishads, are generally classified separate from the thirteen ancient Principal Upanishads rooted in the Vedic tradition. The Shaiva Upanishads also contrast from other groups of minor Upanishads, such as the Samanya Upanishads which are of a generic nature, the Sannyasa Upanishads which focus on the Hindu renunciation and monastic practice, the Yoga Upanishads related to Yoga, the Vaishnava Upanishads which highlight aspects of Vishnu, and the Shakta Upanishads which highlight Shaktism. The Shaiva Upanishads extol Shiva as the metaphysical Brahman and the Atman (soul, self). A few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad include alternate terms such as Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. Some Shaiva Upanishads include sections with symbolism about costumes, rites and objects of worship in Shaivism. Date The Shaiva Upanishads and other minor Upanishads are a separate subgroup from the thirteen major Principal Upanishads considered to be more ancient dated to be between eighth and first century BCE; however, the estimates for the minor Upanishads vary. According to Mahony, the minor Upanishads are approximately dated to be from about 100 BC to 1100 AD. Patrick Olivelle states that sectarian Upanishads attached to Atharvaveda were likely composed in the second millennium, until about the 16th century. One of the thirteen Principal Upanishads, namely the Shvetashvatara Upanishad mentions Shiva, Rudra, Hara and other Vedic deities, as well as Samkhya-Yoga and Vedanta philosophy.R Tsuchida (1985), Some Remarks on the Text of the Svetasvatara-Upanisad, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies (Âç∞Â∫¶Â≠∏‰ΩõÊïôÂ≠∏Á†îÁ©∂), Vol. 34, No. 1, pages 460‚Äì468, Quote: \\"The Svetasvatara-Upanisad occupies a highly unique position among Vedic Upanisads as a testimony of the meditative and monistic Rudra-cult combined with Samkhya-Yoga doctrines.\\"Max Muller, Shvetashvatara Upanishad, The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, pages 238-241 Shvetashvatara is neither considered a Shaiva nor a minor Upanishad.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 301‚Äì304, 317Robert Hume (1921), Shvetashvatara Upanishad, The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 400‚Äì402 with footnotesM Chakravarti (1995), The Concept of Rudra-≈öiva Through the Ages, Motilal Banarsidas, , pages 20‚Äì23 and Chapter 1 The Nilarudra Upanishad is an important Shiva- focussed Upanishad, remarks Deussen, from the group of five minor Upanishads which assert god Shiva as a symbolism for Atman (soul). These are ancient Hindu texts, with Nilarudra likely the oldest (composed closer to Shvetashvatara Upanishad), but Nilaruda is not included in the anthology of 108 Upanishads by Muktika like the other four of the five.

She turned to the Dominicans after a sudden conversion from a dissolute life and was noted for her simplistic life born out of her conversion. She was a pious and devoted child but after she was married she fell into secular values rather than following her faith. De' Botti had fierce detractors due to her stating she had religious ecstasies at Mass - which was true - and these opponents had even acknowledged her as a true living saint. The confirmation of her local 'cultus' on 27 March 1824 allowed for Pope Leo XII to approve her beatification. Life Villana de' Botti was born in Florence in 1332 to the merchant Andrea de' Botti. De' Botti was a pious and devoted child who ran from home in 1345 in order to join a religious order at their convent. But the order she approached refused her and she was forced to return home to face the ire of her father. Her father decided to counter possible future attempts to join a convent when he decided to arrange his daughter's marriage to Rosso di Piero Benintendi in July 1351. But the rejection from the order she went to and her marriage changed the once-pious de' Botti who adopted a life of laziness and extravagance. But as she dressed in a gown of pearls and precious stones and prepared for an entertainment event she saw her reflection in the mirrors around her take the shape of demons as a reflection of her sin-laden soul. So she tore those clothes off in favor of something simple and wept as she fled to Santa Maria Novella and begged the priests of the Order of Preachers for their help while also making her confession. The converted soul became a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic and began to concentrate on her married life while spending her time reading Sacred Scripture (she was fond of the Epistles of Paul) and reading hagiographical accounts of saints. Her austerities as a sign of penance and her begging door to door concerned her husband and parents who had to stop her from continuing them. She also was given to religious ecstasies at the celebration of Mass but became the object of slander and ridicule - her detractors however realized in due course that she was a living saint. De' Botti died in 1361 wearing the habit of the Dominicans and on her deathbed she asked that the Passion be read out to her; she died when the words \\"He bowed His head and have up the Ghost\\" were read out. Her remains were taken to Santa Maria Novella but the priests were unable to inter her for a month due to the constant crowd of mourners. Her bereaved husband often said that when he felt discouraged or depressed he would go to the room that his late wife died in for solace. Beatification Tomb.

She now uses a guide dog. Fachie attended Gateacre School in Liverpool as a child and matriculated to the University of Birmingham where she studied physiotherapy. She is married to fellow Paralympian Neil Fachie. Cycling career Fachie comes from a sporting family, both her brothers have represented England in VI (visually impaired) cricket and Roy played 5-a-side football for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Fachie first became involved in cycling in 2009 whilst at university. That year she was teamed up with sighted rider Rebecca Rimmington and Fachie attended her first UCI Para-Cycling World Cup event, in Italy, winning bronze in the Tandem B road race. The following year she took gold, again with Rimmington, in the road race at the Spanish World Cup. =2012 Summer Paralympics= In 2011 Fachie switched pilot, now racing with Fiona Duncan. The two found success at their first major international event when they won the silver at the 2011 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Montichiari in the Pursuit. Fachie also picked up two more World Cup medals that year, a silver and bronze, in Sydney. Fachie and Duncan spent another season together, taking gold in the time trial at the World Cup in Segovia, Spain. Fachie's results saw her selected for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, selected for both road and track events. On the road Fachie finished 7th in the time trial and 8th in the road race. The time trial was particularly disappointing for Fachie as she suffered a mechanical fault to her bike whilst holding a 14-second lead on the final lap. In the track she finished just outside the podium places in both her events, losing the bronze medal race against British teammate Aileen McGlynn in the individual pursuit and a fourth-place finish in the 1km time trial. Following London Fachie was paired up with a new pilot, Corrine Hall, and quickly her fortunes improved. At the 2013 UCI Para-Cycling Road World Championships in Baie-Comeau, the pair took gold in the time trial and silver in the road race. More medals followed with a second world title at the 2014 Road World Championships, this time in the road race, with a further bronze in the time trial. 2014 also saw Turnha collect four more gold medals on the World Cup circuit, two each at Castiglione della Pescaia and Segovia. Although Fachie failed to win a medal in the 2015 World Championships, this time paired with Lauryn Therin, she was back to winning ways when reunited with Hall as they continued to win World Cup gold. A time trial title at Yverdon-les-Bains in Switzerland and both the time trial and road race gold at Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. =2016 Summer Paralympics= In the buildup to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Fachie and Hall took part in the 2016 Track World Championships, winning bronze in the Tandem individual pursuit. Fachie then travelled to Ostend in Belgium where she took two more silver World Cup medals. The pair were later named as part of the Great Britain team to compete at the Rio Paralympics, entering four events over both road and track disciplines. Fachie was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to cycling.

He later represented Annandale and Fairfax in the Virginia Senate, from 1964 to 1979. Early and family life Omer Hirst was born in Annandale, Virginia, to Thomson Mason Hirst III and Edna Mae Bennett. His father farmed chickens, long before the area became a suburb of nearby Washington, D.C. He graduated in 1930 from Lee-Jackson High School in Alexandria, and received a B.S. degree in commerce in 1936 from Washington and Lee University, and was invited to join the Phi Beta Kappa society. He married Ann Palmer, and they had three children but later divorced. He married Nancy Hand in 1972, and she survived him. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Marines during World War II, and upon returning to Virginia was active in his Methodist Church, as well as the Lions, American Legion, Marine Corps League, Fairfax Historical Society, Boy Scouts, Fairfax High School Parent Teacher Association and various business and community associations in his native Annandale. Career After graduating from college, Hirst reluctantly joined his father's real estate business, and later came to live in McLean, Virginia. In 1938, the Fairfax Chamber of Commerce put him on a committee to develop a county mapping system and update land records. As a smart and reserved real estate investor in residential, industrial and commercial property, Hirst became rich. His companies, Omer L. Hirst Inc., and O.C. Builders Inc. developed Landmark Shopping Center, the first three-department-store shopping mall in the area. First American Bank, a local bank he founded in Herndon (and on whose board of directors he served for two decades) later merged with the Arlington Trust Company, and then into Wachovia Bank.Washington Post obituary A \\"Roosevelt Democrat\\", Hirst was active in local politics, and Fairfax County's transition from a rural form of government to a county executive system. In 1953, he and John C. Webb were elected to represent Falls Church and Fairfax in northern Virginia in the Virginia General Assembly, a part-time position. They replaced Edwin Lynch, who was the only delegate elected to represent fast-growing Fairfax County between 1946 and 1951. Both often criticized the Byrd Organization, which considered them \\"Young Turks\\" for actions such as Hirst's attempt to repeal the poll tax. He and Webb were soon embroiled in the Massive Resistance crisis whereby U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd fought desegregation of Virginia's schools despite the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. After both the Virginia Supreme Court and a three judge federal panel on January 19, 1959, massive resistance became more passive, but Hirst declined to seek re-election. Fellow real estate broker Dorothy S. McDiarmid, who ran against the Byrd Organization's school closing strategy, won the Democratic primary and was elected in November, 1959. In 1963, Hirst ran for the Virginia state senate seat. He was elected, and re-elected in 1965, 1967, 1971, and 1975. By the time he retired, Hirst had become the third most senior state senator, and chairman of the Privileges and Elections Committee. Although Hirst had not joined Webb and John A. K. Donovan) as named plaintiffs in the reapportionment case ultimately decided (in Northern Virginia's favor) by the U.S. Supreme Court in Davis v. Mann (1963), he later worked on reapportionments in its aftermath, as well as subsequent censuses. Two of his legislative priorities were education and roads. Hirst helped create George Mason University Law School as well as enable the university to award graduate degrees, and served on its board of directors for 13 years. His wife also served on the university's board of visitors from 1983 to 1991 and later on the College of Arts and Sciences Advisory Board. Hirst also extended Interstate 66 inside the Capital Beltway and helped create the Dulles Toll Road, which officially is named after him and fellow legislator Adelard Brault. Hirst chaired the Senate Welfare Committee (1968‚Äì1971), which recommended reforms adopted in 1970, and the Commission on Mental, Indigent and Geriatric Patients (1972‚Äì79). He helped pass a liquor by the drink law, which allowed Virginia restaurants to serve alcoholic beverages. Hirst declined to seek re-election in 1979 and was replaced by Richard L. Saslaw in 1980.

Duglioli wanted to become a nun for the Poor Clares but instead married in order to please her parents. Duglioli is best known for commissioning a chapel with an image of Saint Cecilia to whom she was devoted. Her beatification received confirmation from Pope Leo XII on 26 March 1828 after the approval of her local 'cultus' (or popular devotion). Cardinal Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini - the future Pope Benedict XIV - spoke for her beatification cause while it was in its initial stages and included the example of her cultus as part of his work \\"De Servorum Dei Beatificatione et Beatorum Canonizatione\\". Life Elena Duglioli was born in Bologna in 1472 to the aristocrats Silverio Duglioli and Pentisilea Boccaferri. In her childhood and adolescence she desired to become a professed religious and decided to enroll at the Poor Clare convent of Corpus Domini, Bologna but decided instead to please her parents and enter into marriage to the much older Benedetto dall'Olio in 1487. Duglioli remained married to her husband for a total of three decades before he died and left her widowed. She was a close friend of Antonio Pucci who was the nephew of Cardinal Lorenzo Pucci. Personalities such as Pope Julius II and Pope Leo X learned of Duglioli and drew from her wisdom and insight despite never having met her. Duglioli harbored a particular devotion to Saint Cecilia and the papal legate to Bologna - Cardinal Francesco Alidosi - gave her a knucklebone relic of the late saint to keep. In her marriage she had struggled to live the chaste life in emulation of the saint but managed to persuade her husband not to consummate their marriage in order to achieve this. Her devotion to the saint led to her commissioning a chapel that would see Raphael paint an image of the saint in that chapel. Duglioli died on 23 September 1520. Her incorrupt remains are housed in the church of San Giovanni in Monte.

After mostly being raised by her grandparents, her grandfather in particular serving in the Union Army during the civil war, she joined the religion at age 35 and around the same time began also writing short fiction, eventually having a long career writing for Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine. In the religion, her service as a speaker was wide-ranging, and soon she advanced from position to position in the religion as first an Auxiliary Board member and then a Continental Counselor and then one serving at the International Teaching Centre ‚Äì the highest appointed positions of the religion during her later years. Meanwhile, she was a successful writer with almost 20 years of continuous annual appearance in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and almost half her stories were also anthologized even as late as 2012. Early life Born into the Foose/Foos family, her grandfather claimed the \\"e\\" was added by a Union Army clerk to his name. Through her grandmother she claimed relation to President Zachary Taylor. However the family was as proud of traveling preacher John Taylor. In her autobiography Mayberry highlights and praises her aunt Charlotte-Mariah whom her exasperated grandmother would occasionally compare her to. Her feisty personality grew up after an era rife with family based abuse of women save in the case of her grandparents. They lived along the Wabash River in Indiana. The family moved to Missouri where the family spent many years. There is a Foose Missouri \\"intersection\\" in the vicinity which might have been the site of the grandfather's store.Google Map location of Foose in Jackson Township, Missouri, west of their home near Conway. Her mother Myrtle married at 16 to a 27-year-old Scot, Bill Wilson, Mayberry's father. They lived in Lebanon, Missouri, then the town of Sleeper on the other side of Lebanon from her grandparents. Myrtle eventually divorced him and the family held rumors that father Bill tried to kidnap baby Florence and was caught by her grandfather. Bill was a train station agent. The family then moved to Texas in Deaf Smith County. Her mother married \\"a cowboy\\" while she was raised by her grandparents. Oddly Mayberry remembers her mother calling her \\"Sister\\" But this too was a short lived marriage. Then the mother and daughter moved to California to wed Wilbur Walton and the family rented out rooms in San Francisco. They alternated housing a couple times and were still living San Francisco in 1912 near the Golden Gate Park Panhandle. The family had connection to an unnamed Protestant denomination and was very anti- catholic. Mayberry recalls an event in her autobiography in October 1912 when she was about 6 yrs old. While in the park she encountered a group who tried to invite her to meet some referred to as \\"Him\\" near a portal of the park ‚Äì she later came to believe this to have been people who had accompanied  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, whose presence at the park in October 1912 was confirmed. However she could not confirm enough details to prove it specifically. But she recalled them as \\"My people\\" though she was called away by her mother even if the welcome was warm. However they soon went back to Missouri where her grandparents had returned and mother went on to work in St. Louis at the Famous-Barr department store but shortly she returned to live with Wilbur while Florence stayed on with her grandparents until she had a little brother and the whole family moved to Waverly, Missouri. The family became friends several African-Americans: Ollie, a neighboring African- American, and insisted an African-American family eat with them at their kitchen table. There was a \\"visit\\" from the social ladies of the town who communicated to them that the norm in the area was in favor of maintaining segregated eating ‚Äì and her grandfather quipped back, as Mayberry recalled, \\"Tell your menfolks this. As a boy I fought in the Civil War for Abe Lincoln. The idee was to fix things so black folks are free to be like God wanted 'em to be. Free and equal. A colored man or woman is as good as Becky'n me. In my house they eat at my table, because I eat at my table. And tell your menfolks this, too. I keep a loaded shotgun under my bed. And the first man, or men, steps on my land I bought and paid for to force me or my woman to change how we treat folks on our property will get its full blast. And I reload fast. I thank you, Ladies, and good afternoon.\\" However Florence did not pursue the friendship with Ollie and was put off by her strangeness, but came to regret her lack of friendship in later years. During her 8th year the family was reunited and they moved to Oakland, California together arriving on her 9th birthday in 1915. She attended the Denman School for girls (see John Swett) and was a steady reader of books and magazines. She told her brother, Richard Walton,Richard Walton (1914‚Äì2005), askART, from of the mysterious meeting by the portal of the park and recalled going to the De Young Museum. And a search for a church for Sunday School was started around her 9th year. A year later she tried Christian Scientist following her mother seeking to overcome her chronic asthma but didn't see a social fit for her as she advanced in studies there. The first World War broke into her awareness in her 11th year followed by the Spanish flu though she and her family recovered, some neighbors didn't. At fourteen the family briefly moved to Indiana arriving in Newport of Hoosier County where her grandparents then lived. She entered the eight grade there. Then they moved to Fresno, California and during a spell of illness she began to seek God's guidance on what to believe. There was another temporary separation of her parents and the kids went to stay with the grandparents in Newport. Florence went as a senior to high school in Indiana and also began to teach Sunday school in nursery class and had finished reading the entire Bible as part of her senior English class. She was upset that the Bible was ordered taught in a literal fashion according to the denomination's rules at the Sunday school. She remembered particularly the Adam-and-Eve story being trouble and was \\"brought to a half\\" by the rendering of the story of Jonah. She confronted the local minister that she couldn't accept it as literal \\"And furthermore\\" she recalled saying \\"I will never join any church which leave out any people. Because I believe God made the whole world and all the people in it. I will only join a church which doesn't divide by denominations, color, heathens, nothing, just one for everyone. So I can't teach Sunday School class here any longer.\\" Encountering the Bah√° º√≠ faith Next her family moved to live with a cousin near Santa Paula, California when Florence was 18 and initially she got a job teaching ballet but switched to joining the local newspaper as a 'society editor' reporter. When she worked there a Bah√° º√≠ couple asked to have an article published on 'The unity of mankind'. However the editor's wife working at the newspaper took it from her after they left and tore it in half and threw it away; 'Bah√° º√≠s! Crazy kooks!' Florence later recalled her saying. She retrieved the papers and read them herself noting the informational meeting was going to be a C. E. Carpenter's home with a speaker from Los Angeles coming. Elizabeth Carpenter kept offering articles and despite they weren't published she and Florence became friends. During a break in the editor's wife presence Florence was able to get one piece in the paper and it continued after her return initially without comment. And news came a daughter was to marry a Persian, Sheikh Ali Yazdi, in 1926.\\"Sheik\\" is often a title but in this case it was actually a name.See Santa Paula girl weds, Press-Courier (Oxnard, California)3 Sep 1926, Fri ‚Ä¢ Page 4 Eventually the editor's wife asked Florence to do a piece on the religion. However Florence could not remember any details when or what she wrote when she wrote her autobiography. However see a newspaper story appeared only a few months later.New religion stars in 69 U.S. cities, Press-Courier (Oxnard, California)31 Jan 1927, Mon ‚Ä¢ Page 3 Florence's mother and brother rejoined Wilbur Walton in Stockton, California. Around then her grandfather-cum-father died in Indiana. It was also around this time when the family met the Kanno Takisha Japanese family who it turned out later had met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in Oakland in 1912. Soon after the family including Florence moved to Las Vegas around the time the Boulder Dam (later renamed Hoover Dam) was being built, (roughly 1930‚Äì1935.) And then they moved to Reno, Nevada. Richard went to Los Angeles to attend an art school. At this time she had a Catholic friend but she couldn't reconcile down to a denomination that excluded others. Then the family moved to Hollywood, California while her brother was in art school and she had an under-study part in a play. But lacking an economic connection they moved back to Santa Paula where she learned short-hand, and then she moved to Reno Nevada again. =Reno= Her spiritual search remained unfocused and unguided though she prayed for it. Soon she was working at the post office and met David Mayberry whom she married four weeks later. His grandparents were Mormon converts but he had no great personal attachment to the denomination. They were married July, 1935. Later while visiting her mother in Santa Paula, she and her mother engaged in conversation on a serious pursuit of religion and she recalled encountering the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to her mother. They found the Carpenter family and went to a fireside informational meeting by the family's daughter-in-law, Marzieh Gail. This was the daughter of well known Bah√° º√≠, Ali Kuli Khan. Florence was not convinced on several points but left with a copy of \\"Baha ºi Scriptures\\" but did not read it immediately ‚Äì indeed she left it for two years. In the meantime the Mayberry family moved outside of Reno into a new home and Elizabeth Carpenter surprised her with a visit having directions from her husband. Carpenter was returning from attending US Bah√° º√≠ national convention and after the visit she gave a brief review of a random page. A few months later her husband reported a Bah√° º√≠ took a job at the post office and that a traveling Baha ºi speaker needed help finding a venue in Reno for a talk she would give ‚Äì this was Mamie Seto. The Mayberry's assisted and appreciated Seto and her talk. Following it they bought a copy of Baha ºu'll√°h and the New Era but it was not a memory of importance that they read it and commented on reading it. This might have been noted in the June 1939 edition of Bah√° º√≠ News.National press book report, Bah√° º√≠ News, June 1939, no 126, p. 6 A few months earlier Florence published her first known piece ‚Äì a Christmas story ‚Äì in Feb 1939 but was thought to have been a man.Frontier and Midland, The Salt Lake Tribune (Salt Lake City, Utah)5 Feb 1939, Sun ‚Ä¢ Page 12 Bah√° º√≠ Helen Grifting moved to Reno and invited the Mayberrys over to dinner. She became a companion on many family outings and through her presence the Mayberrys began to read their now two Bah√° º√≠ books but did not think had to belong to a religion. They attended Helen's fireside talks regularly along with her mother and brother and his new wife. They heard presentations by returning pilgrims and international travelers. Mayberry recalled one night that based on her conversation someone at a bar asked her when she had joined the religion and then finding she hadn't quizzed her what was wrong with it that she hadn't? She was guilty she had been at a bar too even if she was a casual social \\"drinker\\". After some time she interrupted her day and drove off in the car to demand a \\"declaration card\\" from Helen at her work but Helen urged caution ‚Äì \\"Are you sure?\\" She waited. In Sept 1939 Helen notes in Bah√° º√≠ News that there were \\"excellent contacts\\", \\"many friends\\", and three had gone to the Geyersville Summer school, (later moved and named the Bosch Bah√° º√≠ School).Teaching activities, Bah√° º√≠ News, September 1939, no 129, pp. 6-7 The Mayberry's moved from an apartment near a golf course to a cottage ‚Äì around the same time Helen had to downsize her apartment. Wanting to be of assistance and enjoying the meetings the Mayberry's took out a wall so they could have one big room and volunteered to host meetings. Mayberry wrestled over personally praying if mostly they were \\"gimme\\" prayers vs the given Bah√° º√≠ prayers which were for people in general and full of \\"eloquent imagery, strange to the tongue\\". In 1940 Florence recalled going on a trip and stopping in Wilmette and seeing the House of Worship there under construction. This might have been her trip to see F.D. Roosevelt at the democratic national convention ‚Äì she attended.\\"Hats at the Convention\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, July 17, 1940, p. 3 Then there was an incident reported in Mayberry's autobiography. Her mother had befriended an African American lady ‚Äì the couple had been wakened by police and arrested her husband all with rough treatment and language normal of the day. The next day his employer defended his character and he was released. The next day Florence called the Mayor's office, then the chief of police and arguments with them equated prejudice with anti-American behavior, asking that an apology be made public, and the couple received an apology. As a result, Florence was asked to speak at the local AME church. She settled on the story recalling Ollie to tell her audience and her sorrow at not fulfilling a friendship with her ‚Äì it was a healing for her too. Florence then went through an experience May 1941. She felt an intense need to clean her home. She did a good job ‚Äì and then found herself very upset and (in mid yell) called herself a hypocrite for not joining the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. She called her husband and announced she was joining the religion. He said \\"when you ask for your membership card, ask for two.\\" That night her brother's family also joined the religion. The next morning her mother did as well. In October Bah√° º√≠ News noted the Reno community had 6 adults (so Helen plus these five) and hoped to elect an assembly soon.North American Teaching, Bah√° º√≠ News, October 1941, no 147, pp. 7-8 The community had been founded a decade earlier when Gertrude Frazier first moved to Reno.2\\\\.

The declaration of Robert Takeshi Imagire in 1942 at the Mayberry home made the 9th member of the community and a Local Spiritual Assembly, the foundational administrative institution of the religion, was elected.Unfurling the Divine Flag in Tokyo:An Early Bah√° º√≠ History, by Barbara R.

David Mayberry was on a regional committee by July 1943.California, Nevada, Arizona, Bah√° º√≠ News, July 1943, No 164, p. 15 Florence got a job with the US Employment Service. November Florence was the Fair Employment Practices Committee consultant in the area. Together they had their first child March 24, 1945. Fireside gatherings grew larger. When the Reno community of Baha ºis reached nine they elected their first assembly. Assembly noted in 1947.Local assemblies contributing to the national fund, July, 1947, Bah√° º√≠ News, September 1947, No 199, p. 4 =Santa Paula= With discharge from the military the family moved to Santa Paula though she found that the Carpenters had moved away. Both Mayberry's found jobs in the shifting economy and their son Michael was minded by grandmother Myrtle. Florence became a secretary-manager of the Chamber of Commerce when the manager left. The Santa Paula community was highly agricultural and had a significant population of immigrant farm workers. She worked with directors of the Chamber of Commerce to bring together the white and Latino communities into a united Fiesta Parade rather than the traditional segregated practice. And they found that another Bah√° º√≠ family in the area ‚Äì the children of the first Japanese Bah√° º√≠s. In the fall of 1945 she had her first poem published ‚Äì it was in Common Ground magazine and was called \\"Adam's Black Boy\\" was about a black man oppressed and begging ‚Äì the poem ran over a page.Adam's Black Boy, by Florence V.

It proved to be an enormous test after the initial operation which developed into experiences of great pain and multiple operations over two years. Following this she applied to the University of California at Los Angeles. She says she did well in philosophy. She also began to take up poetry as an exploration of faith. In 1950 she was mentioned having published a novel.Caligraphs, by Adaline Moore, The Bakersfield Californian (Bakersfield, California)18 Jan 1950, Wed ‚Ä¢ Page 12 She also gave a talk at the LA Center for Ridv√°n, a pivotal holy day in the Bah√° º√≠ calendar.Baha'i World Faith, Carlifornia Eagle, Apr 27, 1950, p. 27 She wrestled with understanding Shoghi Effendi's leadership as head of the religion when coming out of her Protestant Christian context the Popes were considered trouble. Despite  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° being an even higher leader of the religion, she didn't have a problem with that because she saw him as the ultimate grandfather. She had begun and continued to focus on the special station of the Guardianship held by Shoghi Effendi and gained an emotional attachment and decided to write to him. She outlined her recent activity, trials and achievements. The response encouraged her public speaking as well as study of the Bah√° º√≠ teachings themselves; and he commented that there was \\"a real lack in the Cause of people who know the teachings thoroughly, especially the deeper truths.\\" Florence debated her pursuit of a college degree vs her role in public speaking and worried, feeling also that her studies of the religions' teachings had been impatient and was attracted to the idea of having the teachings \\"imbedded\\" into her awareness. She decided to drop her pursuit of a degree and focused on a close study of the Writings and be able to respond to any call for a speaker for the religion. She gave a talk she gave for World Religion Day in Fresno in 1952.Baha'i Group will fete World Religion Day, The Fresno Bee The Republican (Fresno, California)18 Jan 1952, Fri ‚Ä¢ Page 7 She also published a short story ‚Äì \\"Kiko\\" which was collected in the best fiction of 1953.

She recognized one of the students of the class as signing the letter asking for the trip and she soon headed off by train. She felt it went well but offers no details in her autobiography other than the cultural encounter with Southern warmth on the one hand and segregation on the other. Following the trip she was able to attend the national convention for the 1953 jubilee of the declaration of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's first revelatory experience (in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l) and one of the conferences on the spread of the religion held May 2, 1953. The American Conference also featured a chance to meet Shoghi Effendi's wife, R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum, then a newly appointed Hand of the Cause. She reflected on stories of her from her meeting  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° at 2 yrs old and exploits of her \\"youthful daring, originality of thought, her profound love of nature and animals, and her great courage in teaching.\\" This was also her chance to see the finished House of Worship she had seen more than a decade earlier. The convention and conference were held at Chicago's Medinah Temple. Florence attended as a guest, not a delegate. She was strongly affected by the multi-racial delegates and the talks. Several Hands of the Cause attended and the audience rose to their feet when Ruhiyyih Khanum was introduced to speak. Afterwards, in divisions of about 1600 people at a time, painted portraits of the B√°b and Bah√° ºu'll√°h were viewed and from which she recalled the personal trials the young men were to go through and their personal refinement. =Western Canada= Upon her return home the family business adjusted and Florence became the office clerk for the business. About the same time a letter arrived from the NSA of Canada asking her for a speaking trip in Western Canada for a month. On presenting the letter to her husband she offered to decline the invitation. He recounted a promise he had made to God that if she lived \\"we would dedicate your whole life to the service of His Cause. So if you don't go to Canada I'll have to break my promise to God.\\" She observed a lot of similarities between the Americans and Canadians, while also distinctions of language details and the prevalence of hot tea. She noted both had \\"shoved aside the Indian owners of the land, a problem both were still struggling to amend.\\" She says in her autobiography some of her talks were over kitchen tables and some in halls and universities. She commented on her own now- perceived slow progress to the religion \\"I could now be grateful for my own slow entry; I could understand and empathize with them.‚Ä¶ Some, indeed, appeared as hard-headed, excuse-making as I had been during my search for Truth.‚Ä¶ and I would never be able to spiritual boast about my perceptions.\\" Her Canadian travels went from British Columbia to Manitoba where she met Angus Cowan, later a Counsellor she served with. She returned through the northwest states in abbreviated version some of which were noted in newspapers.* Florence Mayberry will speak at YWCA Friday night, The Independent Record (Helena, Montana)5 Nov 1953, Thu ‚Ä¢ Page 16 * Speaks tonight ‚Äì Florence V.

Most stops this time were one-night stops and most travel was by bus. Often talks were variously from lunch time on to various afternoon events then a break until evening. Then the next day on to the next stop. The pace taxed her strength and she recalled climbing bus steps \\"crab-like\\", hauling her projector and slide collection. During the trip in Toronto one audience member challenged her on the topic of the Anti-Christ and it was the first time she had had the question from the public. Her answer silenced him and he sat down ‚Äì she had referred to \\"‚Ä¶anyone, even a Christian declaring fealty to Jesus Christ, who denies that [returned] Holy Spirit is Anti-Christ. Bah√° º√≠s believe Bah√° ºu'll√°h is that Return.\\" She continued on to Montreal remarking it was especially the region of the home of Ruhiyyih Khanum and where  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° visited and Shoghi Effendi in his authority as head of the religion designating the Maxwell home as a national shrine. News reached her in 1954 of the death of Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker who had died the year before. To Mayberry Backer seemed to inspire her all the more and recalled hearing her voice \\"Spirit is never lost, it persists evanescent, seeking open vessels. Irresistibly it flows into any ready receptor, adding spirit unto spirit.\\" Then flying onward to Prince Edward Island there was a greater sense of her being seen as a foreigner ‚Äì she was told even mainland Canadians were called foreigners and when she arrived at the airport no one appeared to be there to greet her. Others waiting turned out to be waiting for her though they thought she would be gray-haired and she was young (at 47.) Then she did not feel like a foreigner and being welcomed into various groups save for an altercation from a returned logger whose regular bathroom had been assigned to her use as the only female guest of the hotel.

At first thinking she would end the first night of the convention early being weary from her travels she changed her mind when it was brought to her attention that the three Hands responsible for North America were to speak and their nine appointments of their new auxiliary assistants to be announced.* American Hands of Cause appoints auxiliary board, Bah√° º√≠ News, June 1954, No 280, p. 5 * Announcement of Auxiliary Board, Bah√° º√≠ News, June 1954, No 280, p. 18 She was shocked to hear her name as the fourth on their list. She seemed to not be well known in the auditorium and went to the podium to introduce herself to Horace Holley. The Americas (North and South) were split into 9 regions for the auxiliary board and there would be no salary, minimal travel expenses, and they were to avoid any sense of appearing to be clergy. Her region included Western Canada, the US from the Pacific to the Mississippi River plus Alaska and Hawaii. She began to study more intensively and struggled between warming to the encouragement and the warnings of ego in the writings of the religion. Eventually she also learned that it was excessive to spend \\"too much time and emotional strength over self-guilt and recriminations.\\" By August she was on the program at Geyserville Bah√° º√≠ School.Area conferences, Bah√° º√≠ News, August 1954, No 282, p. 11 After the conference she began a tour that gradually grew into a widespread journey - leaving Chicago heading west and variously north or south, then north along the Pacific coast with occasional visits to the Atlantic and deep south.

She was soon offered pilgrimage for Fall 1956 but was delayed by the Suez Crisis. However, when that was over she was alerted while visiting Yakima, Washington by a call from her husband that she had been offered to go in April 1957. In between she gave a talk in Eugene, Oregon.Two lectures on Baha'i set on campus, Eugene Register-Guard, Eugene Oregon, ‚Äì Jan 3, 1957, p. 1 She encountered a family of Persian Bah√° º√≠s on the flight from Rome to Tel Aviv. She was met at the door by Jesse Revel, then treasurer of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, and Isobel Sabri, a pioneer from Africa then on pilgrimage herself, but she had missed the events of the first day of Ridv√°n. Isobel took notes during the pilgrimage and mentions Mayberry a few times.Pilgrim Notes recorded after the nightly dinner-table talks of the beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi by Isobel Sabri 1957 From her autobiography it appears she commented that there is not a great deal of receptivity to the religion in America, asked about the role of auxiliary board members, and asked about childhood education practices. The next morning she found her other fellow pilgrims to be Alice Dudley and Sallie Saynor. They visited the archives which at the time were housed in three rooms of the Shrine of the B√°b. There she saw the passport photograph of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, not knowing it existed previously. Then she went to the Shrine of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° next door. Shoghi Effendi commented that from her report the Alaskan Baha'i community had been progressing well. That day's lunch was hosted by Ruhiyyih Khanum and then the ladies were invited over to Khanum and Effendi's current residence. There she attended a tea reception and then went back to the Western Pilgrim House and then the group had dinner with Shoghi Effendi. There were then successive visits to the prison and other sites of the pilgrimage, and last the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h as a group. Then supper was served nearby. After dinner they visited the upper rooms of the Mansion of Bahj√≠. The next day she visited the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h alone. They returned to the Haifa area for the ninth day of Ridv√°n. A separate feast was held for the men and women and then all approached the Shrine of B√°b and the tablet of visitation was said by Shoghi Effendi himself and the process repeated in the Shrine of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. In two more days Florence was the lone western Bah√° º√≠ left. She recalled Shoghi Effendi referred to a few open spots on the scroll of the Knights of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the first pioneers to a country for the religion, and highlighted the staunchness of Marion Jack. One evening, she recalled, Shoghi Effendi suggested her family \\"Scatter and teach\\" and the consultation in the family later seemed to suggest mother Myrtle should pioneer. She was soon leading some seminars back in the States in Montana and Wyoming in September with various levels of coverage on stations including KGVO.* Spirit of dedication and earnestness characterizes Geyersville sessions, by Beatrice Rinde, Bah√° º√≠ News, October 1957, No 320, p. 8 * Baha'i seminary opens Monday, The Montana Standard (Butte, Montana)1 Sep 1957, Sun ‚Ä¢ Page 13 * Seminar on Baha'i World Faith(advert), The Montana Standard (Butte, Montana)3 Sep 1957, Tue ‚Ä¢ Page 6 * Florence Mayberry will address public meetings, The Independent Record (Helena, Montana)8 Sep 1957, Sun ‚Ä¢ Page 5 * We cordially invite you‚Ä¶(advert), Greeley Daily Tribune (Greeley, Colorado)19 Sep 1957, Thu ‚Ä¢ Page 13 Giving a talk and taught at Geyserville school in OctoberSpirit of dedication and earnestness characterizes Geyersville sessions, by Beatrice Rinde, Bah√° º√≠ News, October 1957, No 320, p. 8 and before meeting in southern California in November.* Seminar series on world Faith starting Sunday, The San Bernardino County Sun (San Bernardino, California)2 Nov 1957, Sat ‚Ä¢ Page 11 * Baha'i Faith member to talk Sunday, Independent (Long Beach, California)16 Nov 1957, Sat ‚Ä¢ Page 10 Following the request of the Guardian the Hands developed boards for proclaiming the religion as well as protecting it from division ‚Äì Florence continued on the one promoting encouraging engaging the public and stirring its members to engaging on issues.American Hands announce appointment of Auxiliary Board for Protection by Corinne True, Paul E.

Instead she struck up a conversation with the hotel manager who, noting she was a previous manager of a Chamber of Commerce arranged to have her show the slides taken from her pilgrimage at the local Chamber meeting that night. That meeting lead to a meeting at one of the homes of the members who also invited friends. One of them declared she would start a class on the religion ‚Äì Charlotte Schwartz.

He acknowledged Felim Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht from 1233 to 1265, as his overlord and gave him his sons as hostages. McKiernan's lands of Tullyhunco were on the border between the O'Rourke and O'Reilly clans and the McKiernans were in conflict with both clans who were trying to assert their authority over them.C.

The Annals of Connacht for the year 1256 state- After the battle of Magh Sl√©cht, Fedlim O Conchobair and his son Aed na nGall, with the men of Connacht, and Tigernan O Ruairc, with the men of Brefne, made an expedition to Loch in Trein; and the two armies fell upon the churches of Brefne, all except Fenagh, and returned to their homes with hostages of the Fir Brefne, that is, of Mac Fiachrach and Mac Tigernain and Mag Samradain and of the son of Art O Ruairc; and Fedlim gave the hostages of the chieftains into the custody of O Ruairc and handed over Mag Samradain to his own son, Aed na nGall. Conchobar son of Tigernan O Ruairc, king of Brefne, and Gilla na Naem Mag Samradain and Mac Raith Mag Tigernain, the son of Cu Buide, and Mac na hOidche Mag Dorchaid and Cathal Mag Ragnaill and the sons of the kings and chieftains of the Ui Briuin with their followers came to Fenagh to meet with Domnall O Raigillig. They pursued him from the meeting-place and killed his beloved son Annad and Gilla Isa Mac in Chrottaig (Son of the Hunchback) [O Raigillig?] and many others. Next day, St. Brendan's day, they took a great prey out of Cruacha O Cubrain and plundered the country all the way to Fenagh. That day was ‚Äòa drop before a shower‚Äô to the Muinter Raigillig, since from it proceeded the beginning of the harm and harassing that afterwards befell them. For it is then that they sent envoys to the Connacht Galls, Macwilliam Burke and Mac Gosdelb, [inviting them] to destroy Connacht and Brefne. The Annals of Loch C√© for the year 1256 state- Another great hosting, after this battle, by Fedhlim O'Conchobhair and his son, i.e. Aedh-na-nGall, accompanied by the Connachtmen, and by Conn, son of Tighernan, with the men of Breifne; and these two hosts came, moreover, to Loch-an-trein, and attacked the churches of Breifne except Fidhnacha alone, and turned back to their houses, taking with them the hostages of the men of Breifne, viz.:‚Äî of Mac Fiachrach, and MacTighernain, and Mac Shamhradhain, and the son of Art O'Ruairc; and these hostages, i.e. the sons of these chieftains, were delivered into the hands of O'Ruairc; and Mac Shamhradhain and the son of Art O'Ruairc delivered their own hostages to Aedh-na-nGall. A small force of cavalry, and a few footmen and mercenaries of O'Ruairc's people, went to patrol the territory of Muinter-Maelmordha, for it had been reported to O'Ruairc that emissaries of O'Raighilligh's people had collected to one place all the force that they found of Foreign and Gaeidhelic mercenaries, who had gone to make a circuit of Muinter-Maelmordha, and on a predatory expedition to Mac Fiachrach. As regards Muinter-Raighilligh, however, they encountered O'Ruairc's people at Farnacht; and when they saw each other's faces, Muinter-Raighilligh gave way, although they were three great battalions. Not alone this; but thirty-six men of them were slain on the spot, eight of whom bore the family name of O'Raighilligh, including Amhlaibh O'Raighilligh, and Aedh, son of Cathal O'Raighilligh; and O'Ruairc's people went home joyously, contentedly, without sorrow, without reverse. Conchobhar, son of Tighernan O'Ruairc, king of Breifne, and Gilla-na-naemh Mac Shamhradhain, and Macraith, son of Tighernan Mac Conbhuidhe, and Mac-na- hoidhche Mac Dorchaidh, and Cathal Mac Raghnaill, and the princes and chieftains of U√≠-Briuin, with their forces, came to Fidhnacha to a meeting with Domhnall O'Raighilligh; and they followed him from this meeting, and killed his beloved son, i.e. Annadh O'Raighilligh, and Gilla-Isa Mac-an- Crottaigh, and many more along with them; and they carried off a great prey from Cruachan-O'C√∫bhr√°n on the morrow, i.e. the festival day of Brenainn, and plundered the district before them as far as Fidhnacha of Magh-Rein. This day, however, was but a 'drop before a shower' to Muinter-Raighilligh, as then grew the beginning of succeeding tribulation and injury to them; for they despatched messengers at that time to the Foreigners, viz.:‚Äîto Mac William Burk and to Mac Goisdelbh, with a view to devastating Connacht and the Breifne. As regards the Foreigners, moreover, they assembled a very great host, and proceeded to Ceis-Corainn, where they encamped, and where they remained the greater part of a week; and they plundered all the churches of the Corann. As to Muinter-Raighilligh, they advanced to Loch-Aillinne, to the shore of the island which is called Fuar-chossach, on Loch-Aillinne; but the Foreigners came not to this rendezvous, through fear of Aedh O'Conchobhair, who was then at Cill-tSeisin in Uachtar-tire, observing these hosts from the east and from the west, and watching which of them he should attack. With regard to Aedh O'Conchobhair, when he heard that Muinter-Raighilligh had arrived at the place, the resolution which he and O'Ruairc (who was at this time with him) adopted, was to leave their horses and armour at Cill-tSeisin, and to go themselves on foot eastwards across the Shannon, to make an attack on Muinter-Raighilligh; and they went by the passes, and sent routs and mercenaries on before them, to catch Muinter-Raighilligh, ut supra diximus. The Foreigners returned home after this, and the Bishop O'Maicin was 'drowning their candles' about nones, when it was equally dark in field and wood. On the night of the festival of the Cross, truly, Muinter-Raighilligh were routed; and it was on the spot in which this engagement was fought that Aedh O'Conchobhair passed that night; and Muinter-Raighilligh were beheaded by him on the morrow in that place, and he brought their heads to Fedhlim, to Dun- Aille behind Badhna. Death Macraith was killed in 1258 by Domnall O'Ruairc (son of Conchobar son of Tigern√°n), king of Breifne from 1258 to 1258 and the McKiernans retaliated by killing first Domnall's brother, Cathal O'Rourke in 1258 and then Domnall himself in 1260. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1258 state- Magrath Mac Tiernan, Chief of Teallach-Dunchadha, was slain by Donnell, son of Conor O'Rourke. The Connacians, and the men of Breifny in general, upon this took the lordship from Donnell, and the inhabitants of Tealach-Dunchadha slew his brother, Cathal, son of Conor. After this the lordship of Hy-Briuin, from the mountain eastwards, was conferred upon Art, son of Cathal Reagh O'Rourke. The Annals of Lough C√© for 1258 state- Macraith Mac Tighernain, dux of Tellach-Dunchadha, was killed by Domhnall, son of Conchobhar, son of Tighernan O'Ruairc. It was then that the men of Breifne and all the Connachtmen took his sovereignty from this Domhnall, son of Conchobhar, and the men of Tellach-Dunchadha killed his brother, i.e. Cathal, son of Conchobhar, son of Tighernan O'Ruairc; and the men of Breifne and Connacht gave the sovereignty of U√≠-Briuin to Art, son of Cathal Riabhach O'Ruairc. The Annals of Connacht for 1258 state- Mac Raith Mag Thigernain, chieftain of Tellach Dunchada, was killed by Domnall son of Conchubar son of Tigernan O Ruairc. And for this reason the men of Brefne and the Connachta took his kingship from the said Domnall and the Tellach Dunchada killed his brother Cathal, and the men of Brefne and the Connachta gave the kingship of the Ui Briuin to Art son of Cathal Riabach O Ruairc. The Annals of Ulster for 1258 mistakenly state he was killed by Domnall McKiernan rather than Domnall O'Rourke- Mac Craith Mag Tigernain, chief of Tellach Dunchadha, was killed by Domnall Mac Tigernain. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1260 state- Donnell, son of Conor, son of Tiernan O'Rourke, was treacherously slain by the inhabitants of Tealach-Dunchadha; and Murtough, his brother, was afterwards slain by Hugh O'Conor. Art Beg, son of Art O'Rourke, was also slain by Hugh O'Conor. The Annals of Connacht for the year 1260 state- Domnall son of Conchobar son of Tigernan O Ruairc, king of Brefne, was craftily killed by the Tellach Dunchada. Muirchertach his brother was then killed by Aed O Conchobair. The Annals of Loch C√© for the year 1260 state- Domhnall, son of Conchobhar, son of Tighernan O'Ruairc, i.e. the king of Breifne, was killed by the Teallach-Dunchadha by deceit; and Muirchertach, son of Conchobar, his other brother, was afterwards killed by Aedh O'Conchobhair. The Annals of Ulster for 1260 state- Domnall, son of Concobur, son of Tigernan, was killed by the Tellach-Dunchadha.

A student of Jacques Fromental Hal√©vy for counterpoint, and Berton for composition, he presented in 1845 the competition of musical composition of the Institut de France and won first Second Grand Prix de Rome, the only prize awarded that year. The chosen poem was Imogine by Pierre-Ange Vieillard (scene with three voices). In 1849, after his doctorate in international law, he was employed at the Foreign Ministry. He made many trips abroad in the diplomatic service, primarily in Belgium and Russia. He ended his career as consul-general in Australia.

She is remembered for her self-portraits and landscape photographs of Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland), as well as for her paintings, writings which strove to make visible the colonial histories and complex ethnic and cultural relations between Denmark and Greenland. Throughout her artistic-research practice, the artist used the metaphor of her own mixed-heritage (the \\"mongrel\\") as an opportunity to engage these historical relationships, as well as address significant questions of Arctic Indigenous identity and representation. Pia Arke Early life Arke was born on September 1, 1958 in Ittoqqortoormiit in northeastern Greenland to a Danish father (the telegraphist J√∏rgen Gant) and a Greenlandic mother (Justine Piparajik Birgitte). She was brought up in the Thule area of northern Greenland and in the southern town of Qaqortoq, but like many children of similar parentage she never learnt to speak Greenlandic. She lived with her family both in the east and west of Greenland. After initial schooling in Danish-language schools in Greenland, she moved with her family to Denmark when she was 13. In 1987, Arke returned to Copenhagen, Denmark where she attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen to study painting under Mogens M√∏ller and Per Bak Jensen, graduating in 1993. That same year, Arke entered the Department of Theory and Communications at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen. She graduated with an MFA in 1995 with a published thesis titled, Ethno-Aesthetics/Etno√¶stetik, an essay that powerfully critiques Western romantic and primitivist stereotyping of \\"Eskimo\\" art, foregrounding critical issues of cultural identity and authenticity in art.  Career  In the late 1980s Arke began to exhibit her paintings. In 1988, the artist developed her own life-size pin-hole camera (camera obscura) which she hand-built using pine and plywood, to photograph the landscapes of Greenland that she had known as a child. The results were exhibited in her exhibition Imaginary Homelands in 1990. The structure had a small entry-way where the artist would climb in and attach a sheet of film along the back wall. Light from the outside would then stream in through a small hole at the opposite end of the enclosure. The artist would often take advantage of the slow exposure process, (fifteen to thirty minutes) by staying in the box to manipulate the process through the use of her own body which would cast a visible shadow on the finished image. In his Editors' introduction to Pia Arke. Arctic Hysteria 1997, Iben Mondrup describes how her exhibition was provocatively called \\"Arctic hysteria\\", given the controversial irrationality that was said to affect indigenous women. Her exhibitions and accompanying explanations encouraged Denmark to reexamine the colonial history of Greenland. While a number of exhibitions were held during her lifetime, the first major exhibition of her work in Denmark did not take place until after her death with Tupilakosaurus (2010). Her art and photographs re-examine the places where she lived as a child revealing Denmark's repressive colonization. Tupilakosaurus consists of over 70 photographs, paintings, videos, installations and reports. As a result, Arke is now recognized as one of the Nordic region's most important postcolonial critics and players as a result of the artistic research which she practiced for two decades.TUPILAKOSAURUS: Pia Arke's Issue with Art, Ethnicity, and Colonialism, 1981-2006, e-flux.com, Retrieved 6 August 2016 Legacy Pia Arke died of cancer in May 2007 when she was 48 years old. She is considered to have achieved the goal of getting Denmark to reconsider its role. Her books have been re-issued and a film and exhibition was created in 2010 at the National Museum of Denmark. Her 1995 book \\"Ethno-Aesthetics\\" and \\"Stories from Scoresbysund\\" (2003) were made available in English, Danish and Greenlandic.

The plant opened in 1877. The works made steel sheared plates to build ships (among other uses) - plates from Clydebridge were used in many famous vessels such as the ocean liners of the Cunard Line (Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary and QE2). Steel manufacture at the site ended in 1978; the site had manufactured steel with an open hearth furnace, the type of melting shops that British Steel wanted to discontinue. In the mid-1970s, it employed around 3,500. The plate mill at Clydebridge plate works rolled its last plate on 12 November 1982. The M74 motorway now runs through the works site adjacent to the remaining buildings. As of 2016, it is currently owned by Liberty House Group and employs 45 workers in its heat treatment and quenching facilities. In late 2017, it appeared the future of the Clydebridge and Dalzell sites was again uncertain when Liberty offered redundancy packages to its workforce, but a few months later, Liberty Group owner Sanjeev Gupta announced a further \\"¬£1bn investment in Scotland\\" under his Greensteel production strategy. History * 1887 ‚Äì Clydebridge Steel Company opens as an independent private firm, managed by Walter and Hugh Neilson who are members of a family of Scottish ironmasters. * 1907 - Closes due to an economic downturn. * 1915 - Taken over by Colvilles to provide steel for World War I materials. * 1917 ‚Äì King George V visits; works double in size. * 1920 - Clydebridge has 2000 employees. * 1923 ‚Äì A new plate mill is installed, among many other improvements making the works one of the most modern and efficient of the time. * 1928 ‚Äì The Prince of Wales (Edward VIII) visits. * 1932 ‚Äì The firm survives the Great Depression but output drops by up to half and staff numbers dip to their lowest at 507. * 1938 ‚Äì King George VI visits. * 1939 ‚Äì Clydebridge is linked to the Clyde Iron Works, becoming one of the largest integrated steelworks (producing both the hot metal and the finished steel) in the UK; a gas pipeline and railway bridge is constructed over the River Clyde which separated the two plants. * 1951 ‚Äì Works are nationalised as part of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain, this lasts until 1955 then ownership reverts to Colvilles. * 1959 - Colvilles' new steelworks at Ravenscraig in Motherwell is completed. * 1962 ‚Äì Installation of 4-High Plate Mill and Heat Treatment & Quenching Plant sees works reach their maximum size. * 1967 ‚Äì Works again nationalised as part of British Steel Corporation. * 1974 ‚Äì Clydebridge has 2410 employees. * 1977 - Clyde Iron Works and the Clydebridge melting shops (which had produced 20 million tonnes of steel in the preceding 90 years) closes, with hundreds of job losses. * 1980 - Clydebridge workers (now numbering 800) take part in the steel strike from January to April. * 1982 ‚Äì The Plate Mill and Light Shearline are closed, making more unemployed - just 150 remain in a vastly downscaled operation. * 1988 ‚Äì British Steel is privatised; Clydebridge has 100 workers. * 1999 ‚Äì British Steel becomes Corus after a merger with Koninklijke Hoogovens, becoming the largest steel company in Europe.

The southern boundary is the Whifflet Line railway tracks (between Rutherglen and Carmyle). During the peak of activity at the works, several branches linked from the main lines into Clydebridge and to the Clyde Iron Works on the opposite bank of the river. The works are approached via an access road under the railway at the southern side of the site (Bogleshole Road), near to Eastfield. Another vehicle entrance with a weighbridge at the west side of the site leading onto Cambuslang Road near Farme Cross is currently not in use ‚Äì an asphalt concrete coating plant (Tillicountry Quarries Clydebridge) is located there. In the 2010s, the vicinity of this entrance consisted of several large warehouses, some of which were subsequently vacated and demolished in anticipation of the construction of a new retail development adjacent to the motorway junction. The project, named Two74, has faced delays in its planning process; by late 2019, the proposals included a large TopGolf driving range complex.Three-Level Golf Range With Bars, Restaurants And Open Air Roof Terrace Teed-Up For Rutherglen, reGlasgow, 13 August 2019'Big box' leisure comes to Rutherglen with golf destination, Urban Realm, 14 August 2019 view looking south-east from the spoil mound over motorway and works buildings The initial Clydebridge plant from 1887 was located in the south east of the territory directly beside the main line railway bridge. This site was chosen as it offered access to the railway, a source of water for cooling processes, a potential link to the river for transportation, had spare ground for waste products and future expansions, and was very close to the existing iron works producing the raw metal, and also near to numerous local collieries who provided the fuel for the furnaces. From around 1902 until 1962, trams and thereafter trolleybuses and buses also ran close to the works along Cambuslang Road in Rutherglen and along London Road (A74) to Auchenshuggle in eastern Glasgow, offering a public transport option for employees. Following the Colvilles acquisition in 1915 the premises were upgraded, with new facilities further west directly alongside the railway. Additions were made to the works throughout the 1930s, 40s and 50s and another enlargement in the 1960s saw new buildings constructed to the north of the older workings. With much of the obsolete works having been removed in the late 20th century, the most prominent of the remaining structures is the blue-coloured industrial shed housing the 4 high plate rolling mill and shears bay - at long, wide and high, it is one of the largest structures in post-industrial Glasgow (Clydebridge is only around 3 miles from the city centre). The downscaled facility nowadays stands amidst an extensive area of brownfield woodland and scrub which conceals the railway sidings, industrial waste and debris of the demolished elements of the works. =Spoil Mound= View across the river Clyde of the site of Auchenshuggle Bridge in 2008 - the buildings of Clydebridge are behind the trees on the left and the spoil mound can be seen rising on the right The rubble of the older buildings was added to the spoil heap located in the north of the site bounded by the river Clyde. This large mound ‚Äì around the same height as the plate mill shed - no longer serves any practical purpose following the closure of the ironworks and the downscaling of the steelworks, and has since been reclaimed by nature. It is possible to walk to the summit, which offers fine panoramic views over the south-east of Greater Glasgow, particularly Rutherglen and Braidfauld. Since 2010 the mound has been separated from the rest of the works by the final section of the M74 motorway which runs through the middle of the site and is connected to the older section of the road by the Auchenshuggle Bridge over the Clyde. A footbridge under the motorway on the north bank of the river allows the Clyde Walkway and National Cycle Route 75 to continue, and a similar footbridge on the south bank connects the Clydebridge works to the mound area ‚Äì a feasibility study was conducted in 2015 on creating a cycling and walking route which would run from Cambuslang to Farme Cross via this footbridge and past the mound, either adjacent to the river or to the motorway. Another proposal for the area involved the site of Hamilton Farm (across the railway tracks from the steelworks), which attracted the attention of Scottish Cycling in 2015. In the 21st century, several modern distribution centres have been constructed in the vicinity to take advantage of the convenient location for the motorway.

The bridge also incorporates a catwalk and water pipe on its south side, added during the period between the 1890s and 1930s when there were large industrial facilities on both sides of the river but no other crossing point for pedestrians (the closest alternative was Cambuslang Bridge over half a mile to the south of the viaduct).

Mickelsen, an evangelical Christian, spent her professional life advocating \\"that being a feminist is a Christian responsibility,\\" despite resistance from some sectors. She published numerous books and scholarly articles on the topic of women's equality within Christianity. Alvera Mickelsen joined her colleagues to co-found Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE) in the late 1980s, a non-profit organization of churches and individuals which advocates for the equality of women within the church, as well as in their homes and society. Additionally, Mickelsen was a longtime professor of journalism at Bethel University in Minnesota from 1968 to 1986. Mickelsen, who was born in 1919 as one of 5 children of Swedish immigrant parents, was raised in a small farmhouse just outside La Porte, Indiana. The family moved to nearby Michigan City, Indiana, when she was nine years old. However, the Great Depression soon left her parents destitute just one year after they relocated to Michigan City. Mickelsen still graduated from high school in 1936 and became the first member of her family to enroll in college. She transferred between several colleges and universities due to scholarships, before graduating from Wheaton College in Illinois in 1942. Following her graduation from Wheaton College, she received her master's degree in journalism from Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. She then became an editor for several Christian magazines and publications based in Chicago, before returning to Wheaton College as a professor. She met her husband, A. Berkeley Mickelsen, while teaching at Wheaton. The couple married in 1952 and had two daughters. Alvera Mickelsen continued to teach at Wheaton while simultaneously completing her second master's degree, this time in education, also from Wheaton. In 1965, the family moved to Arden Hills, Minnesota, where Berkeley Mickelsen had been hired as a professor of Greek, Hebrew and theology at Bethel Seminary. Alvera Mickelsen also became a professor of journalism at Bethel College (now called Bethel University) in 1968, where she taught until 1986. During the 1970s, Mickelsen and her husband, who were progressive evangelicals, became concerned by the perception of a backlash against women's rights and equality within the evangelical community. Together, Alvera and A. Berkeley Mickelsen published two books which cited Biblical passages that supported the equality of the sexes. They began touring Minnesota to debate leading pastors and theologians on the topic of gender equality within Christianity. The Mickelsens later helped to establish the non-profit group, Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE), during the 1980s. Alvera Mickelsen also served as the first chair of CBE's board of directors. After the unexpected death of A. Berkeley Mickelsen, aged 69, in 1990, Alvera Mickelsen continued to tour worldwide to promote gender equality and feminism within evangelicalism. According to Mimi Haddad, the current President of Christians for Biblical Equality, Mickelsen was once asked by a Christian radio show host how she could be both a traditional evangelical Christian and a feminist simultaneously. Mickelsen replied that the host should look up feminism in a dictionary, where the word was defined as \\"a belief that women should have social, political, and economic equality with men.\\" The host replied that \\" 'Well, I believe in all those things', to which Mickelsen responded, 'Well, then, you are a feminist!' \\" Alvera Mickelsen died from natural causes on July 12, 2016, at the age of 97. She was survived by her two daughters, Ruth and Lynnell Mickelsen; her brother, Mel Johnson; and four grandchildren.

Early life and education  Sfar studied brilliantly in College Sadiki before enrolling himself in Lyc√©e Carnot of Tunis. After obtaining his baccalaureate, he was proposed the management and reform of the school of El Arfania, in Tunis. He went to Paris in October 1925 to study law, Literature and political science. There, he found his friends from Sadiki such as Habib Bourguiba, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga, Mustapha Baffoun and Sadok Boussofara. Among his French classmates in Law school was the future French Prime Minister Edgar Faure. Indeed, Faure testified in his memoirs that during the first meeting he had with Habib Bourguiba in April 1955, he started recalling his student memories in Paris and wrote: \\"I told him about his compatriot Tahar Sfar who collected awards in the end of year contest where I collected honorable accessits...\\". Furthermore, Sfar also created, in the end of 1927, with a group of Tunisian, Algerian and Moroccan student fellows, the Muslim Students Association of North Africa, in which he became the first vice-president.  Nationalist activist  First Neo Destour leadership. He returned to Tunis in 1928 to start working as a lawyer in parallel with numerous other activities: Political economy lessons in El-Khaldounia and writing newspaper articles in Arabic or French, such as La Voix du Tunisien and L'Action Tunisienne, which he founded with Bourguiba, El Materi and Guiga, in 1932. He also was active in struggling for independence, among the Destour party then created the Neo Destour with L'Action team, during the Ksar Hellal Congress of March 2, 1932. The new party wanted itself to be modernist in its methods and organization, but at the same time, educator and mobilizer of the low classes for a better awareness of the need to rid the country of colonialism. Sfar was a great friend of Bourguiba, with whom he liked discussing philosophy, his passionate subject. Sfar greatly admired Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and, just like him, advocated for nonviolence. The Neo Destour activists often referred to him as the philosopher of the party.  Imprisonment  In January 1935, Sfar was removed under house arrest in Zarzis, in the Tunisian south, along with Guiga and Salah Ben Youssef. Thus, they joined their Neo Destour mates, taken away in the South since the September 1934 colonial repression. Sfar benefited from his isolation to study law and literature and also write a sort of journal, published in 1960, after his death, titled \\"Journal of an exiled\\" with a preface by Andr√© Demeerseman, manager of Ibla newspaper in Tunis. Demeerseman attended some of Tahar Sfar's political economy classes in El-Khaldounia, at the beginnings of 1930s. After the arrival of Armand Guillon, the new resident-general of France in Tunisia, Sfar was freed in April 1936 at the same time as the other members of the party leadership. The negotiations between Guillon and the nationalists proved to be ephemeral. Sfar was imprisoned after the 1938 political crisis, even though he was part, at the time, of the party's moderates. At the end of April 1939, he left prison with serious health problems and died on August 9, 1942. Before he died, Sfar published in the French feminist journal Le√Øla of December 1939 an article strongly denouncing Adolf Hitler's regime and explaining the danger that he represented for humanity. This article was titled \\"The racist concepts of Hitler\\". At the end of this article and after introducing readers to some significant quotations of Mein Kampf, he ended his critical analysis with the following conclusion:  Political positions  Tahar Sfar mausoleum in Mahdia. Tomb of Sfar in the cemetery in Mahdia. Struggling for the independence of his country, Tahar Sfar also advocated for a real cooperation between the Eastern and Western world, as he wrote in the early 1930s: \\"Peace in the future, progress of the entire humanity depend on this union, this narrow collaboration between East and West, who, instead of turning their backs on themselves, ignore themselves, ought, on the contrary, support each other, provide mutual aid and cooperation for the rehabilitation of the fate of humanity. In an article published by Le√Øla magazine in January 1941 and titled \\"What is a civilization?\\", Sfar developed his own definition of civilization and concluded by writing:  Family  Tahar Sfar was the son of Mustapha Sfar, a notary in Mahdia. Tahar Sfar married a cousin, Salha Sfar, daughter of the notary Mohamed Sfar, in 1929. He had three children: two daughters, Zeineb and Najet, and a son, Rachid Sfar, future Prime minister of Tunisia under Habib Bourguiba, from 1986‚Äì87.

Unveiled in 1921, the memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens following his design for the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London and is today a grade II* listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic war memorials. The Queen's Own Royal West Kent memorial is one of seven cenotaphs in England designed by Lutyens besides the one on Whitehall, and one of two to serve as a memorial for a regiment (the other being the Royal Berkshire Regiment War Memorial in Reading, though the Welch Regiment War Memorial in Cardiff, Wales, is also a regimental memorial in the form of a cenotaph). A committee was formed in December 1918 with a view to commissioning a war memorial for the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, who lost 6,866 men in the First World War. After settling on a reduced-scale version of the Whitehall Cenotaph, the committee commissioned Lutyens to design it. Whereas Lutyens had insisted that his Stone of Remembrance should never be reduced in size, it appears he was happy to design a two-thirds-scale cenotaph. History and design The memorial, situated in Brenchley Gardens, was built by local construction firm GE Wallis and Sons. It was unveiled by Major General Sir Edmund Leach, colonel of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment at a ceremony on 30 July 1921. The dedication was performed by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alderson gave an address to the crowds. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the colours of the regiment's territorial battalion (reserves) and service battalion (volunteers who enlisted for the war) were laid up in All Saints Church. The cenotaph (\\"empty tomb\\") is almost identical to that on Whitehall, except that it is reduced to two-thirds scale and is not adorned by flags.Skelton, p. 89. Built from Portland stone, it consists of a chest tomb, covered by a moulded laurel wreath, at the top of a three-staged rectangular base. The base sits on top of the large rectangular shaft, set back slightly towards the top, which itself rests on a two-stage base of rectangular blocks. The whole structure stands on a base of three shallow steps, typical of Lutyens' war memorials. Decorations on the memorial are sparse, consisting solely of a moulded laurel wreath on the two sides, below which are inscribed the dates of the two world wars (inscriptions for the Second World War were added later). The two faces contain the only inscriptions: \\"THE GLORIOUS DEAD / OF THE QUEEN'S OWN ROYAL WEST KENT REGIMENT / NUMBERING 6866 OF ALL RANKS / ALSO NUMBERING 1663 OF ALL RANKS\\". The memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 2 August 1974. In October 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded. As part of this process, the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment Cenotaph was upgraded to grade II* listed building status, as was the Royal Berkshire's memorial in Reading.

Set on Water, Maple, and Green Streets, it includes houses built and occupied by a diversity of the city's economic classes, from mill owners to laborers. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The city of Vergennes was first settled in the 1760s, but only began significant growth in the 1780s, when it became one of Vermont's early industrial centers. The city is located at a bend in Otter Creek where there is a falls that could be harnessed for water power, and it also benefited by its location as the crossing point of two major stagecoach routes. It was incorporated as a city in 1788. Sawmills, gristmills, and later other types of industry were all powered by the waters of the creek, and the city experienced growth through the 19th century. The area south of the Main Street business district developed during this period as a residential neighborhood, housing an economic and stylistic diversity of buildings. There are a significant number of Greek Revival and Italianate houses, mainly vernacular in style, and many with later Victorian embellishments. The district is also home to two churches, the Congregational Church and St. Peter's Catholic Church, the latter a particularly prominent High Gothic brick building. with The district extends to the south along three roads perpendicular to Main Street: Water Street, Maple Street, and Green Street. It extends along Water Street nearly to Roberts Street, along Maple to a point about halfway between King and Victory Streets, and along Green to King Street. It includes buildings on the cross streets between these streets, and excludes buildings facing Main Street.

The name \\"Tabbles\\" is portmanteau of tag and bubbles.  Overview  Tabbles generates in real-time a tag-based relational file system, where tags can be accessed as folders or used as keywords for search. It supports any kind of files and documents on local and shared drives, as well as many cloud storage or file synchronization systems. Tabbles allows users to collaboratively tag files on network drives, through group and user policy management.  Data management model  Tabbles implements a relational approach to file and data management, as an extension to the traditional file management being hierarchically structured, similar to Microsoft's WinFS. Files, emails and bookmarks are categorized by labeling them with tags, instead of placing them in hierarchical folders or containers. The data is then browsed, sorted and retrieved by navigating and searching through tags, or combination of tags. Tags are visualised and browsed as virtual folders. A relational file system is generated dynamically, independently from the physical location of the data. This allows for files or emails physically stored in different folders or machines, to be grouped and browsed together at once.  Technology  Tabbles was among the first commercial software developed in F# and WPF, and was featured on F# creator's blog. It has a client-server architecture, requires a Microsoft SQL Server to run and relies on stored procedures for the core logic and the security management. Tabbles is tightly integrated with Windows and Windows Explorer using several APIs: FileSystemWatcher, IFileOperationProgressSync, Overlay Handlers, ContextMenu Handlers, Win32 API, Office interop, Outlook interop. It uses VSTO to integrate into Microsoft Outlook.  Features  * Tagging files in local folders, network drives, removable drives, optical disks * Auto-tagging files and folders, local and remote, based on user defined rules * Tagging files from the application's GUI, Windows Explorer, from 3rd party file managers, from command line and via APIs * Tags on files and folders managed by file synchronization tools (such as Dropbox) are synchronized * User and groups privileges for tagging on shared folder and network drives * Graphically browse through single tags or combinations, as if in virtual folders * Tag emails (in Microsoft Outlook) and bookmarks * Administrator management window for user and groups creation and management  Reviews  Tabbles received multiple reviews, among others from the Washington Post, Lifehacker, Chip and several paper magazines. Reviews were typically mildly positive and focused on the innovative side of the application.

E. Van Vogt, first published in 1959 by Simon & Schuster. The novel is a fixup made from six short stories and two connecting chapters. Component stories The six short stories that comprise most of the novel, all originally published in Astounding Science Fiction, are: *Chapters 1-4: \\"Co-Operate - Or Else!\\" (April 1942) *Chapter 5; new material bridging the gap between the first and second stories. *Chapters 6-7: \\"Repetition\\" (also known as \\"The Gryb\\": April 1940) *Chapters 8-13: \\"The Second Solution\\" (October 1942) *Chapters 14-16: \\"The Green Forest\\" (June 1949) *Chapters 17-19: \\"The Sound\\" (February 1950) *Chapter 20; new material bridging the gap between the fifth and sixth stories. *Chapters 21-25: \\"The Rull\\" (May 1948) Plot 1-4: Trevor Jamieson is stranded in a deadly jungle on the planet Eristan II with an ezwal, a 3-ton, six-legged saurian-like creature that dislikes humans and wants them to leave his native world, Carson's Planet. Having bailed out of a crashing spaceship, Jamieson and the telepathic ezwal must make their way to the wreckage in hopes that the subspace radio survived and they can call for help. Their journey is interrupted by a cruiser belonging to the Rull, creatures that appear to have evolved from chameleon-like worms and who are implacably hostile to all intelligent life. The Rull capture the ezwal, but must lie hidden when a Terran battleship engages their cruiser. When a native plant kills the Rull, the ezwal guides Jamieson to their lifeboat and Jamieson flies the two of them to safety. 5: Jamieson arranges to return the ezwal to Carson's Planet. As they part, the ezwal rejects Jamieson's request that the ezwals develop a mechanical civilization capable of fending off the Rull. Jamieson finds a similar intransigence in the human settlers, all of whom have had family members killed by ezwals. One young woman tells him that Carson's Planet's moon is habitable and offers to guide him on tour of it. 6-7: On Carson's Satellite Barbara Whitman leads Jamieson into a trap. Her plan fails to kill Jamieson, but they are both stranded on a hostile world. They begin walking back toward the city whence they came and Jamieson uses his wilderness survival skills to obtain food for them and save them from a blood-sucking gryb. Several days later the crew of his ship finds and rescues them. 8-13: Jamieson had been concerned about a female ezwal and her cub being taken to Earth. The ship carrying the ezwals crash lands in Alaska and a crewman kills the mother, who kills him before she dies. The cub manages to escape and is pursued over the landscape by men who believe he is merely an animal. Jamieson comes as the men are closing in and with the ezwal's cooperation convinces the men that the ezwal is an intelligent being and persuades them not to kill him. 14-16: Jamieson is organizing a project on the planet Mira 23 to obtain a fluid from a native lifeform in order to create a substance that will poison the Rull. Kidnaped by Rull agents, he is taken to Mira 23, where he will be used to frame the project's leader for his murder. He is left in the forest, where the lethal fauna will kill him, though the three Rull agents are killed by a menace they did not anticipate. Jamieson is then rescued by the project's leader. 17-19: In Solar City Jamieson's son Diddy is on a quest to find the source of an all-pervasive sound. During the all-night quest he is accompanied by Rull spies and saboteurs, who use him to gain access to The Yards, where a giant spaceship is being built. With the aid of counterspies and the ezwal cub, he obtains a flame gun and kills the saboteurs. Then he completes his quest. 20: With the ezwal cub accompanying him, Jamieson goes to the planet Ploia to capture one of the natives. Made up entirely of electromagnetic fields, the Ploian sends electrical systems into a frenzy, so Jamieson must use purely mechanical devices to control his ship. Through the ezwal's telepathic ability, he makes contact with the Ploian, which agrees to help him in return for a promise to take it home. 21-25: Jamieson has gone directly from Ploia to Laertes III to make a preliminary survey of the planet as a base of operations against the Rull. A Rull survey boat disables his lifeboat but is itself shot down. Jamieson must then engage the Rull in a battle of wits for ten days. In that time he manages to condition the Rull with a subconscious belief that the war is futile. At the end the Rull captures him, but the Ploian frees him and they go home in a Rull lifeboat. The Rull Jamieson confronted turns out to have been a Prime Leader and he does, indeed, end the war.

Interested in the public works being planned in Turkey, he studied the Turkish language, and at the age of 24 moved to the Ottoman Empire. Meissner died in 1940 in Istanbul. Railway work =Early works= Starting in 1886, Meissner served in a number of important posts related to civil engineering in the Ottoman Empire. He worked on railways in southern Bulgaria, Macedonia, Antalya and Thrace. =Hejaz and Baghdad railways= Meissner was invited to manage the construction of the Hejaz Railway, the largest public works undertaking in the empire. In the eight years from 1900 to 1908, he was able to build the main section, from Damascus to Medina, including the Jezreel Valley railway. In 1904 he received the title of pasha from the Sultan for his work on the railway, stretching only from Damascus to Ma'an at the time. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Hejaz Railway project was abandoned, and Meissner moved on to the Baghdad Railway project, funded by the German Empire.

As a two-year-old colt he won two of his first five races before ending his season with a win in the Observer Gold Cup. He was rated the best colt of his generation in the 1972 Free Handicap. In the following year he was narrowly beaten by Mon Fils in the 2000 Guineas before suffering a career-ending injury in The Derby. He had no success as a breeding stallion. Background Noble Decree was a \\"strong, shapely, most attractive\\" bay horse with a very small white star bred in Florida by Kinsman Stud Farms. He was sold twice at auction in the United States, fetching $75,000 as a foal in 1970 and $145,000 as a yearling in the following year. On the latter occasion he was bought by representatives of the Texan oil billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt who sent the horse to be trained in Europe. The colt was sent into training with Bernard Van Cutsem at his Stanley House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. At the time, Van Cutsem was one of the most successful trainers in Britain, handling major winners including Park Top and Karabas (Washington, D.C. International Stakes). Noble Decree's sire, Vaguely Noble, won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery His dam Hidden Secret was a stakes winner and half-sister of the Hollywood Derby winner Terry's Secret. Her dam Secret Session was also the female-line ancestor of the Kentucky Derby winner Strike the Gold. Racing career =1972: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced over five furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse in May Noble Decree started favourite for the Kennet Stakes over six furlongs in June but was beaten half a length by Sharp Edge, a colt who went on to win the Irish 2000 Guineas. Later that month he was stepped up to seven furlongs and won a maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse and won by a length from Starred. In July he started odds-on favourite for the Exeter Stakes over the same course and distance and won by three lengths from the filly Exmoor Lass. The colt was then moved up in class and distance for the Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. In a rough and unsatisfactory race, he finished second, beaten half a length by the Noel Murless-trained Adios, with Sharp Edge in third. On his final appearance of the season, Noble Decree contested the Group One Observer Gold Cup (now the Racing Post Trophy) at Doncaster in October in which he started at odds of 8/1 in a ten-runner field. The French challenger Kalamoun started favourite ahead of Duke of Ragusa (winner of the Solario Stakes), whilst the other runners included Mon Fils, Stanleyville (Prix des Ch√™nes), Kwang Su (third in the National Stakes), Pince Chad (second in the Gimcrack Stakes) and Van Cutsem's other runner Ksar and impressive winner of a maiden at Newmarket. With the stable jockey Willie Carson opting to partner Ksar, the ride on Noble Decree went to Lester Piggott. After being restrained towards the rear of the field as the outsider Hurry Round set the pace, Noble Decree began to make rapid progress on the outside in the last quarter mile. He overtook his stablemate Ksar inside the final furlong and won by half a length despite hanging left towards the rail in the closing stages. Stanleyville took third place ahead of Kalamoun. =1973: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Noble Decree ran in the Ladbroke Classic Trial over seven furlongs at Kempton and appeared unsuited by the course and distance as he finished fourth against moderate opposition. His next race was the 175th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmmarket on 5 May. Apparently relishing the soft ground he briefly took the lead in the final furlong before being overtaken in the final strides and beaten a head by the 50/1 outsider Mon Fils. Sharp Edge finished third ahead of Thatch. The race established Noble Decree as a major contender for The Derby. With Carson again choosing Ksar (who had won the Sandown Classic Trial and the Lingfield Derby Trial) and Lester Piggott opting to partner Cavo Doro (a horse he had bred himself), the ride on Noble Decree in the Derby went to Brian Taylor. He was strongly fancied for the race, which was run on very firm ground, but after running well he dropped away quickly in the straight and finished unplaced behind Morston. He was found to have sustained a serious back injury which ended his racing career. Assessment In the 1972 Free Handicap a ranking of that season's best British two-year- olds Noble Decree was assigned a weight of 132 pounds, making him the highest- rated colt of his generation: he was however, rated a three pounds inferior to the filly Jacinth. The independent Timeform organisation rated him on 127, two pounds behind their best British two-year-old colt The Go-Between, three pounds behind the French colts Targowice and Simbir, and six pounds inferior to Jacinth. In their annual \\"Racehorses of 1972\\" Timeform opined that he was \\"bound to win good races\\" but was not a \\"ready-made classic winner\\" and stated that two-year-old colts of 1972 seemed to be \\"a moderate lot\\". In 1973 he was rated 124 by Timeform, twelve pounds inferior to their top-rated three-year- old Thatch. Stud record After beginning his stud career in at the Gainesway Farm in Kentucky, Noble Decree was exported to Australia in 1977. He had very little success as a sire of winners in either location.

Structure Cerrad√£o is a drought-resistant (\\"xerophitic\\") type of forest, with relatively sparse and slender trees. It includes species that are found in the cerrado strict sense and others that are found in forest. It has a canopy that is mostly continuous with tree coverage of 50% to 90%. Trees have an average height of . Cerrad√£o trees are taller and denser than cerrado, and have straighter trunks without lower branches. Although physiognomically cerrad√£o is a forest, floristically it is closer to a cerrado. The lighting conditions allow formation of differentiated strata of shrubs and herbs. The undergrowth bushes average in height. The ground layer consists of grasses that grow where there is most light. Leaves are often small and succulent, capable of holding water, with dense hairs or thick skin that prevent loss of water. The falling leaves add organic matter to the soil. Typically the soils are deep, well-drained, slightly acidic and of low to medium fertility. Flora Many species are evergreen, but deciduous trees are common, including Caryocar brasiliense (pequi), Kielmeyera coriacea (pau-santo) and Qualea grandiflora (pau-terra). Common species adapted to the poorer soils include Emmotum nitens (sobre), Xylopia aromatica (pimenta-de-macaco), Caryocar brasiliense (pequi), Maprounea guianensis (pinga-orvalho) and Copaifera langsdorffii (copa√≠ba). Common species where the soil is richer include Anadenanthera colubrina (angico), Astronium fraxinifolium (gon√ßalo- alves), Dilodendron bippinatum (maria-pobre) and Callisthene fasciculata (jacar√©-da-folha-grande). Threats Originally about 1% of the cerrado was cerrad√£o. Cerrad√£o is one of the most vulnerable vegetation types in the cerrado. It covers a small area, is vulnerable to fires, and is exploited for charcoal, timber, agriculture and pasturage. Relatively little of the cerrad√£o is in protected areas.

The term chaperome was first coined in a 2006 publication in Cell by Balch and co-workers on the finding that down-regulation of the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 rescues misfolding of CFTR in cystic fibrosis to describe the overall chaperone folding environment, or the \\"chaperome\\". In 2014, Brehme and co-workers systematically studied the expression dynamics of the full human chaperome comprising ~300 human chaperones and co-chaperones in human aging brains and in brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Integration with chaperome-wide functional RNA interference (RNAi) perturbation experiments in worm and in human cells led to the identification of a chaperome sub-network that safeguards proteostasis in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a comprehensive literature survey reviewed the literature since the release of the human genome sequence in 2000 for systematic studies in small animal model systems and highlighted the power of model systems to unveil those key chaperone modifiers of proteotoxicity out of the large number represented in the wider human chaperome that could inform targets and strategies for therapeutic regulation of chaperone functionality. In 2016, a Nature article authored by Rodina et al. introduced a novel term, epichaperome, to refer to a network of existent chaperomes that are found only in cancer cells. More specifically, a few of the major players of this network include heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70). As opposed to in normal, healthy cells, where these chaperomes are abundant and functional on their own, in cancer cells, changes in the interactions between chaperomes lead to the formation of a network of chaperomes, co-chaperomes, and related co-factors. What has been found is that this strengthened network amongst chaperomes is a mechanism for survival for cancer cells when adapting to stress including hypoxia and heat. The small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor, PU-H71, has been found to have a preferential binding to Hsp90 when it is in the highly integrated complexed form that is the epichaperome.

He was developed for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) legal drama mystery television series How to Get Away with Murder. Portrayed by Jack Falahee, he is one of the series' main characters. Walsh is a Philadelphia- based law student, who works as an intern for the law firm of Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) as one of the \\"Keating Five\\".  Casting  Walsh is portrayed by actor Jack Falahee, who auditioned for the role on How to Get Away with Murder during the television pilot season (January to February) in 2014. Falahee had initially auditioned through video for the assistant to the casting director of Murder, before auditioning for another pilot series, Agatha. Although the latter series did not proceed, the casting director of Murder had reviewed his audition tape. By February, Falahee joined the series' creator and executive producer, Peter Nowalk, for screen tests in the role of Walsh; the scene was for the pilot episode, whereby the character is at a bar trying to pick up Oliver. Nowalk was full of awe in response to Falahee's audition, adamant that, \\"[f]rom the minute he opened his mouth, he sounded just like Connor should\\". On February 12, 2014, it was announced that Falahee had officially secured the role of Walsh in the series.  Development  = Characterization = From the outset of Murder, the character is portrayed as sly, sophisticated, confident, and used to getting what he wants. Walsh is openly gay, and has a \\"rampant\\" sex life; Buzzfeed explains, that \\"with a libido as powerful as his mind, [Walsh] has unapologetically used his sexuality to bend men to his will and manipulated everyone blocking his path to career advancement\\". When being tested for HIV in \\"It's All My Fault\\", the clinic nurse asks him how many sexual partners he had during the past year, to which he estimates between 30 and 40. = In How to Get Away with Murder = In the pilot episode, Walsh is introduced as a law student of Middleton University, a college in Philadelphia. During his first day of law school, Walsh meets Professor Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) in her criminal law class. He meets Oliver at a bar, a computer technician, who he sleeps with in order to obtain the information he needs to gain the admiration of Professor Keating. The intelligence he gains is rewarded with a trophy, and Walsh is selected by Keating to join her team ‚Äìthe Keating Five‚Äì despite his questionable methods. In \\"Let's Get to Scooping\\", Walsh has sex with Paxton Curtis, someone he suspects is behind insider trading at the brokerage firm of Keating's client, Marren Trudeau (Elizabeth Perkins). His suspicions are correct, and after he reveals this to Keating and Trudeau, Curtis' boss humiliates and fires him. Curtis commits suicide, to which Walsh is left visibly distraught and feeling survivor's guilt. Walsh was portrayed by Falahee throughout the duration of the series In \\"Smile, or Go to Jail\\", Walsh reveals that he attended boarding school with Michaela Pratt's fianc√© Aiden Walker (Elliot Knight); he discloses to Pratt that Walker may be gay, as the two previously shared a relationship while at school. Pratt and Walker later end their relationship in \\"Best Christmas Ever\\", predominantly as a result of this revelation. The episode \\"It's for the Greater Good\\" reveals that his father is gay, and now re-married to another man. In \\"Was She Ever Good at Her Job?\\" his father tells Oliver that Connor came out to his family at age 12; that announcement prompted his father, who was closeted and married to Connor's mother, to come out to the family a week later. This prompted his mother to have a nervous breakdown, and strained Connor's relationship with his father. Walsh has an older sister, Gemma Walsh (Jennifer Christopher), and a niece and nephew. = Relationship = Walsh and computer technician Oliver Hampton (Conrad Ricamora) have had an on-and-off relationship almost from the inception of the series. In the pilot episode, the two meet at a bar, wherein Walsh seduces Hampton into giving him illegal documents to bolster a case of Keating's. At first, Hampton denies him access to the files; however, Walsh flirts with another guy, inducing Hampton into giving him the information he wants. As a way of thanking him, Walsh has sex with Hampton, much to the technician's surprise and delight. Throughout the first few episodes of the series, the two continue to have a casual sexual relationship while Hampton assists Walsh in obtaining information. By the fourth episode, \\"Let's Get to Scooping\\", Walsh has developed feelings for Hampton; while he attempts to reveal this to Hampton, the revelation is cut short when Hampton snoops through Walsh's phone, and learns of Walsh's tryst with a person of interest in a case. Coming to the conclusion that Walsh uses sex as means of furthering his own career, Hampton kicks him out. Months later, Walsh shows up unannounced to Hampton's place, after burning Sam Keating's body, freaking out and telling him that he \\"screwed up\\". Hampton is initially bewildered and unsure of what to do, but eventually comforts Walsh and invites him in. The following morning, Walsh lies to Hampton by saying that his behavior was a result of intoxication and that he has a drug problem. Walsh is eager to start fresh with Hampton in \\"Hello Raskolnikov\\"; however, this is not reciprocated by Hampton, who still resents Walsh's conduct. By \\"Best Christmas Ever\\", Walsh surprises Hampton with a Christmas gift ‚Äì a beanie ‚Äì and asks that they resume their relationship. Hampton initially resists, but he then reveals that he is addicted to Walsh. In the penultimate episode of the first season, \\"The Night Lila Died\\", the two agree to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although Walsh tests negative to any disease, it is revealed in the season finale, \\"It's All My Fault\\", that Hampton tested positive to HIV. In the second season premiere, \\"It's Time to Move On\\", to prove that his commitment to Hampton and the relationship they share, Walsh moves into Hampton's apartment. Even though Connor disapproves, in \\"Two Birds, One Millstone\\", Oliver helps Annalise and Keating 5 in the Caleb-Catherine Hapstall case by hacking and finding a prospect suspect lead, Phillip Jessup. Unknown to them, Phillip has hacked Oliver too and knows what they are up to. When Oliver disappears for a short while, Connor panics thinking he is kidnapped. Oliver returns and says Phillip just wanted to talk, while showing a straw he snuck from Phillips for a DNA test. Connor, desperate to keep himself and Oliver away from Annalise and all the murder cases, applies to Stanford Law School and asks Oliver to move away with him, in \\"It's a Trap\\". In the final episode of second season, \\"Anna Mae\\", Oliver deletes Connor's Stanford acceptance email, calls the Dean of Students to decline his spot and hacks their system to re-route all calls to him. In the third season premiere, \\"We're Good People Now\\", Connor asks Annalise to refuse Oliver a job that he is going to ask, saying it would ruin him. Annalise agrees and gives her word that she won't hire him. But Oliver reveals to her about Connor's Stanford email and says he can hack her too to check for security vulnerabilities. Annalise, afraid that Oliver would find out about Sam, hires him as a technical expert. With no other option, Connor agrees with Annalise. Later, when he apologizes to Oliver for not taking his feelings into account before applying to Stanford, Oliver feels this is not how healthy relationships work and that he should have been angry instead of apologizing. This leads to Oliver breaking up with Connor. After Connor wins his first pro bono case, in \\"There Are Worse Things Than Murder\\", Connor kisses Oliver and asks to be back together but Oliver doesn't agree. Heartbroken, Connor packs up and leaves Oliver's apartment to stay at Michaela's for a while. Connor goes back to his usual sex escapades with guys from \\"Humpr\\" and doesn't make an effort to hide it. Oliver, though somewhat hurt, doesn't say anything to him. In \\"Call It Mother's Intuition\\", Oliver goes on a date with a guy from the internet, named \\"Thomas\\" for which Connor confronts him asking why he said he needed to spend some time alone if he is going on dates with other guys. Even though Thomas expresses his interest in Oliver, he turns him down after learning Oliver is HIV positive. Oliver gets drunk and goes back to Connor where they confess that they miss each other, leading them to have sex and being back together. In \\"No More Blood\\", Oliver keeps asking Connor about the things that he is hiding which leads to another argument where Oliver calls him \\"emotionally damaged\\". Connor, once again hurt and heartbroken, goes back to Michaela's apartment and cries saying \\"I hate him! I hate him so much!\\", breaking a glass table in anger. In \\"Who's Dead?\\", Oliver tries to apologize to Connor on multiple occasions but Connor blows him off each time. At a party sponsored by Annalise after the entire class cleared their midterms, Connor gets drunk and Oliver worries about him, reminding him about his drug problem. Connor, in his drunken state, confesses that he lied about being an addict and that he wasn't high that night (when Sam was murdered) but was traumatized. Later Oliver does his own research and correctly guesses that the Keating 5 had something to do with Sam's murder. After Annalise's house burns down and Connor is unreachable, Oliver fears the worst but is relieved when Connor shows up at the hospital. In the later episodes, it's shown that Connor was at the house before it burned down and that he had seen, tried to revive Wes but failed. When everyone suspects Connor of lying, Oliver defends him and stands by him. Oliver, now aware of all the murders, tries to be understanding of how Connor handled everything alone while he can't bring himself to go by his usual way. Connor admits this is why he didn't tell him anything and that he could still go to the police, make everything stop. In the final episode, \\"Wes\\", after Connor is kidnapped and later freed from Denver by Annalise, Oliver proposes to Connor asking to marry him and \\"make a million babies\\". In the beginning of the season four Oliver hasn't gotton an answer to the proposal. Then Connor tells him that he wants to get married but not because Oliver is afraid that Connor is going to jail or someone is going to kill them. In \\"Nobody Roots for Goliath\\" Connor told Oliver that his dad told that he didn't think that Oliver would be the right guy for Connor. Then Connor proposes him and says that he is happy because of Oliver. Then Oliver is told he's been lying to Connor because he knows who killed Wes. Then Connor goes straight to Laurel's and before Laurel opens door he says Oliver that give the ring back because he thought they were in a good place but because Oliver lied to him. In \\"Ask Him About Stella\\" Connor says that he wants to go to law school again and says that it would be difficult with the school and planning the wedding. Then Asher asks \\" Did you just... ?\\". Which Connor says \\" What do you say? You still want to marry me, Oli?\\" and Oliver says \\"You're the one that called if off\\" and Connor's answer to that \\"Well, it's called back on.\\" In season five Oliver and Connor move to another house because they wanted to save money for the wedding. Then Connor's and Oliver's mother's come to visit them before the wedding. Later Oliver told his mom about the HIV and then his mom told that \\"I just hate that you felt you had to go through this all alone\\" then Oliver says that \\"I wasn't alone, I had Connor\\". A few night's before the wedding in episode \\"I Got Played\\" Connor and Oliver had a meeting with a minister who marries them. The minister asks that \\"Why you two wanna to get married?\\" and Oliver answer that it's \\"really simple. I wanna know and spent time with Connor for the rest of my life.\\" and Connor answers that \\"Because he's the best thing that's ever happened to me.\\" In later part of the episode Connor says to Oliver that \\"I will marry you in church for a million times as long as I can be with you.\\" In \\"I Want to Love You Until the Day I Die\\" Oliver and Connor get married. Oliver says in his vow to Connor that \\"My dream was you\\". And Connor says to Oliver \\" Because of you I want things I told myself I never did. I want to love you until the day I die. You're everything to me\\". Then later on the episode Oliver sings to Connor the song \\"All of Me\\" by John Legend. In season six Connor and Oliver had a threesome with a man called Ravi. When Oliver told Connor that he knows maybe were Laurel is (because Frank told him) Connor says \\" I'm your husband. You can say anything to me and I can take it because we're married and I don't wanna divorce yet even though I'm really angry right now.\\" Then Oliver says that \\" I knew you would tell Annalise\\" Then Connor says \\"No, I wouldn't,\\" and Oliver answers to that \\" I don't know if I believe that\\" and Connor says then \\"You don't trust me that's what you are saying. After everything we been through together. I'm your husband who loves you more than enything in the world, you don't trust me.\\" When Connor was arrested for killing Asher he could take a deal and he wouldn't go to jail. Oliver try to get Connor take the deal. Connor eventually takes a deal for five years in prison and immunity for Oliver, only to later learn that Michaela and Laurel got deals for probation. Connor subsequently expresses remorse for his life of lying and deceit and after Laurel reveals their perjury on the stand, Connor decides to go to prison and stop lying. Connor files for divorce from Oliver, feeling that he is only causing Oliver harm and turning him into a bad person. As he is arrested following Annalise's exoneration, Connor hands his wedding ring over to Oliver who refuses to accept the divorce. Connor's last words to his husband are to thank Oliver for showing him how to truly love someone. In the flash-forwards in the series finale, its shown that Connor and Oliver's relationship ultimately did survive and they didn't get divorced. Connor and Oliver are seen attending Annalise's funeral together years later, waving at Laurel who identifies them as old friends to her now-adult son Christopher Castillo. = Friendship = Connor spends most of his time with the Keating 5 and Oliver, his husband. It is shown that he is closest with Michaela (Aja Naomi King). After learning about Connor applying for Stanford, Michaela asks him to stay back saying \\"I can't survive here without you\\". She also lets Connor crash at her place after Oliver breaks up with him and defends him after learning about Connor's role on the night Wes was murdered, even though Asher (Matt McGorry) and Laurel (Karla Souza) don't believe him at all. Not the best friendship and not shown openly, Connor had a cordial relationship with Wes (Alfred Enoch). In \\"We're Bad People\\", Connor revealed to Wes that he was going to therapy nowadays like he did when he was 17 and was struggling with coming-out issues, and jokes that except this time he talks about the murders. He clears it up that he talked about Oliver. After Wes died, Connor did not have kind words for him, which was him channeling his grief in a bad way, which lead Asher and Laurel to dislike and suspect him. Asher punches Connor but later they forgive each other. Asher has always been a supportive friend to Connor and likewise Connor too helped Asher after his father died, even though his intentions weren't entirely pure at that time. In \\"He Made a Terrible Mistake\\", after learning about Connor's role on the night Wes was murdered, Laurel goes on a rant against him saying he's lying, he's the reason Wes died, and that, he should take a gun and kill himself, unaware that Connor is already struggling with suicidal thoughts. Connor has a \\"bratty\\" relationship with Annalise and makes it clear, more often than not, that he doesn't trust her. When Annalise confronts Connor about Wes' death, Connor has an outburst where he says hurtful things after she calls him \\"paranoid and broken\\" and someone who's afraid to live alone and trust anyone since he was a child. Annalise understands Connor and asks the group to forgive him, saying he might kill himself if they didn't, thus making it clear that she knows about Connor's suicidal thoughts. She has also referred few times to herself saying she and Connor are \\"worriers\\" and are similar in nature.  Reception  The character as well as Falahee's acting have been well received by both fans and critics of the series. After the first season of Murder (2014‚Äì15), Connor Walsh was ranked by IndieWire thirteenth in a list of \\"best LGBT characters on television\\". IndieWire went further, stating: \\"He's definitely not an ideal human being, but he's certainly an authentic fascinating one.\\" Vanity Fair columnist, Richard Lawson, was partly drawn to the series because of the character Walsh, commending \\"Falahee‚Äôs ambitious, underhanded Connor Walsh [who is] allowed to be both good and bad, saint and sinner.\\" When accepting the \\"Outstanding Drama Series\\" award at the 26th GLAAD Media Awards on behalf of the Murder cast, actress Viola Davis emphasized the importance of Walsh and his journey. TVOvermind praised Falahee for his portrayal of Walsh, contending that the actor \\"plays his role to a tee.\\"  References   External links  * Connor Walsh on IMDb * Character biography at ABC Drama television characters Fictional murderers Fictional gay males Fictional LGBT characters in television Television characters introduced in 2014 Fictional characters from Pittsburgh How to Get Away with Murder ","title":"Connor Walsh (character)"},{"id":"51259620","text":"Tibbi is a village in Sultanpur Lodhi tehsil in Kapurthala district of Punjab, India.

The family originated from North Kuthiathode. Thachil Matthoo Tharakan was a significant figure in the history of the families and Travancore State.  History  Oral tradition has it that St Thomas, the disciple of Jesus Christ who came to India in 52 AD, landed in the port town of Kodungalloor in Kerala and established a Christian community there. Later a group of Syrian Christians led by Thomas of Cana landed in Kodungalloor between 4th and 9th centuries. Emperor Cheraman Perumal welcomed them and gave all help to the expatriates for settlement. They established and operated the famous Mahadevar Pattanam a market town. The expatriates were wealthy and through their successful business activities became prosperous. Thomas of Cana led a group of 72 families, as well as clergymen, when he arrived at the Malabar Coast. There they encountered and supplemented the Saint Thomas Christians, previously evangelized by Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Copper plates referring to this story exist, but are of a substantially later date. During the war, Mahadevar Pattanam was destroyed and many expatriate families moved down the coast to Travancore in the south. Thachil Illam was one of the famous Brahmin Tharavad in Kerala. Thachil Brahmins were chief priests in the Thirumoozhikkulam Temple. They were converted to Christianity and migrated to Kuthiathode. Some believe that they were converted to Christianity by Thomas of Cana (Knai Thomman). Thachil Variyath is the patriarch of the family who migrated to Kuthiathode.  Branches  Thachil family branched into over 20 sub families, quite a few of them have migrated to different places like the Alangad Thachils who settled in Angamaly. Some of the sub Thachil families who have roots in North Kuthiathode are as follows: * Alangad Thachil (settled in Angamaly) * Chavedyil * Kanjirakkatu * Kolenchery * Kalapurakal * Kambolam Kandathil * Kovattu * Kizhakke Veetil * Kizhakke Ambattu * Manakkalakatuttu * Padinjare Ambattu * Puthenveettil * Vadakkeveetil Some of the other sub Thachil families are Kannai from Puthenchira, Kanjirakattu from N Paravur and Poochoodan from Angamali.

Built in 1907 as a combination music hall and parish house (the latter for the nearby Bethany Church), it boasts one of the best-preserved period theatrical interiors in northern New England. The building is now owned by the town, and continues to be used for entertainment events. The portion of the building that housed the parish house is now an art gallery. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Chandler Music Hall and Bethany Parish House in 1973. Description The Chandler Music Hall is located in downtown Randolph, on the east side of Main Street just northeast of its junction with School Street. The Bethany United Church of Christ stands directly across the street. It is a large two-story masonry structure, built out of rusticated cast concrete blocks and covered by a truncated hip roof. Its styling is basically Romanesque, with arched entrances (two to the theater, one to the former parish house) and a combination of round-arch and rectangular windows. The theater entrances are set in a hip-roofed projecting that fronts a gable-roofed projection on the northern side of the main facade. with A stained glass window by artist Phil Godenschwager The theater interior has a vestibule with paneled ticket booth, and stairs on either side leading to the balcony. The auditorium has a wooden floor sloping down to the stage, and the balcony is supported by columns with Doric capitals, with theater boxes on either side near the stage. The stage area has a multicolored proscenium arch, and the space has a pressed metal ceiling. History The impetus for construction of the music hall came from the merger of two churches in 1905. The Christian Church and Congregational Church stood across the street from one another, and shared a minister and similar theology. After they agreed to merge, Col. Albert B. Chandler offered to fund the construction of a music hall on the site of the Christian Church, with the combined church (now Bethany) funding the construction of the attached parish house. The music hall was a popular local event venue until the end of World War II, when it began a gradual decline. The theater was turned over to the town in 1947, which has continued to operated it since. In the 1970s, the parish and the town exchanged the parish house section for a house next to the church, which now serves as its parish house. The parish house portion of the hall now serves as an art gallery.

De Gu√©lis was initially in the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1940 and later joined SOE and parachuted into France to organise resistance networks. He was badly injured in a motor accident in August 1945 and later died of his injuries in hospital. He is buried in his home town of Cardiff. Biography De Gu√©lis was born in Cardiff on 6 April 1907. His French father, Raoul, was a coal exporter, his mother was Marie. He was educated in Cardiff and then studied at Magdalen College, Oxford. He held dual nationality but completed his required French national service in the 1930s and then returned to Britain to work in advertising in London and Paris. In 1938, he married Beryl Richardson. The family regularly travelled for holidays at the French family property, in Sancerre, in Cher. Second World War =Interpreter= Following the declaration of war in September 1939, de Gu√©lis returned to France to join his unit in Orl√©ans. In early October, 1939 he was then posted as a liaison officer to the British 234 Field Company of Royal Engineers. De Gu√©lis was an interpreter on the staff of Lord Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. He was later evacuated from Dunkirk in early June but later returned to France via Cherbourg on 12 June to assist other forces to escape. Following the surrender of France on 22 June 1940, de Gu√©lis fled south to Marseilles. He then travelled to neutral Spain via the Pyrenees. Held in an internment camp by Spanish authorities at Miranda del Ebro, his release was organised by the British embassy. De Gu√©lis then travelled by boat to Glasgow arriving in March 1941. =Staff Section F= Back in London on 14 April 1941 de Gu√©lis, commissioned in the British Army General List (service number 184312), was recruited by Lewis Gielgud to be part of the French section (F Section) (headed by Maurice Buckmaster) of the Special Operations Executive (SOE)). His prior experience of the German occupation of France allowed him to pass on his experiences onto wireless operators and saboteurs being sent to France. Initially, he was regarded as too valuable to SOE to send on missions, but an exception was made in his case. =Mission to Vichy France - August 1941= Front (left to right): Colonel Charles (Commandant X, FTPF), Commandant Thomas (Interallied Mission), Marcel Lacouture (local radio operator), Major (M D) McKenzie (Interallied Mission). Back (left to right): Captain R Maloubier (SOE), 2nd Lieutenant Lannoux (WT operator to Major Thomas), 2nd Lieutenant Jean Claude Guiet (US Army attached to SOE), Major Jacques de Guelis (SOE), Squadron Leader Andre Simon, 2nd Lieutenant Jacques Dufour (SOE). Three months after the arrival of the first SOE agents in France, De Gu√©lis was parachuted into unoccupied Vichy France (along with Gilbert Turck, his radio operator) on the night of 6/7 August 1941, landing near Ch√¢teauroux, with a number of objectives: * Contact agents Pierre de Vom√©court and Georges B√©gu√©; * Recruit additional agents (such as radio operators and couriers); * Provide financial assistance where necessary; * Identify locations for the clandestine landings on the coast of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne; * Locate suitable landing strips for the landing of light aircraft to drop supplies and agents; * Prepare the way for Virginia Hall, the first agent sent as permanent SOE agent in France; * Collect paper specimens (ration cards, demobilization certificates) so they can be copied in England; De Gu√©lis was picked up in France by a Lysander of 138 Squadron; the first time this Special Duties Flight had been done. His arrival at the rendezvous had been severely delayed by an inspection of identity papers by the local police. He arrived back at RAF Tangmere. For the successful completion of this mission de Gu√©lis was recommended for the MBE by Minister of Economic Warfare, Hugh Dalton. =Section AMF Algiers= In November 1942, de Gu√©lis was sent to head up the French section of SOE in Algeria. In September 1943 he was sent to conduct operations against the Germans on the island of Corsica. The Germans withdrew from the island in early October and de Gu√©lis then returned to London in late October 1943. =Low Countries & France= De Gu√©lis's grave at Cathays Cemetery, May 2020 On 19 December 1943 De Gu√©lis was assigned to cover the Low Countries, France and Allied French Directorate as assistant to Lieutenant Colonel JRH Hutchinson planning for the invasion of France in the summer of 1944. In April 1944, he attended radio courses on Eureka-Rebecca devices. =Mission LINDEN= On 7 July 1944 de Gu√©lis was sent to south-western France, to work with resistance forces in the Corr√®ze area. Post war After the liberation of France, he was assigned to the Special Allied Airborne Reconnaissance Force (SAARF) to help coordinate the resistance and to provide feedback information, mainly on the conditions of prisoners of war and concentration camps. He was sent across Europe to search for information. Whilst in Germany, his car was involved in an accident between Flossenb√ºrg and the Weiden on 16 May 1945. He was transferred to a hospital in Lichfield, England, but died on 7 August 1945. De Gu√©lis was cremated and his ashes were interred in Cathays Cemetery in Cardiff, Wales.

It was initially formed in Uetersen as a single unit, Air Force Band 1. Two more were created in March 1959. Following this, the three units were garrisoned in Karlsruhe, M√ºnster, and Neubiberg. On 26 October 2011, the merging of the three bands was announced by the Federal Minister of Defence in the course of a planned reform. On 24 March 2014, the three Air Force Bands combined to form Air Force Band M√ºnster, or Air Force Band 3.  History  The original three Air Force Bands shadowed the Bundeswehr in Upper Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia and Upper Palatinate during military ceremonies. They often operated beyond German borders as part of public relations. This included numerous excursions abroad, namely concerts in Italy, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Canada, missions in the US, UK, Switzerland, Turkey, Portugal, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria, Uzbekistan, Oman, and Afghanistan. Many of the concerts were charity events, with proceeds being donated to a specific cause or charitable organization. Following the unification of the three bands, nearly all public concerts serve as charity events. Naturally, the majority of Air Force Band's tasks were in Germany. These included providing music for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, their appearance as \\"The Merry Musicians\\" on ZDF, as well as the NATO Music Festival in Kaiserslautern and M√∂nchengladbach. They played many concerts, including ones in Karlsruhe, Bremen, Hamburg, Kiel, Braunschweig, Stuttgart, and in 1998 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, which marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the Berlin blockade. Unification of the three bands has not changed their repertoire; Air Force Band M√ºnster still performs regularly. Along with traditional concerts, their activities now include recording for television and CD production.

Rev. Richard Baron (8 September 1847 ‚Äì 12 October 1907) was an English missionary and botanist who worked and lived in Madagascar from 1872 to 1907. Baron attended Lancashire College and was ordained 1872 in Kendal. During his mission in Madagascar from 1872 onwards, he travelled extensively and collected a large number of plants; he sent roughly 12,000 specimens to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, and also deposited collections in other herbaria. He may have discovered up to 1000 new plant species. Besides botany, Baron was also interested in geology and collected amphibians. He quickly learned Malagasy, and published the first Malagasy-language textbooks on plants and geology. Together with James Sibree, Jr., another missionary, he edited the English-language journal Antananarivo Annual. His Compendium des plantes malgaches was the first summary of the vascular plant species known from Madagascar. It was compiled in several volumes from 1900 to 1906 and would eventually list over 4700 species and varieties in 970 genera. Baron died in 1907 from a fever attack while he was in England. Several Malagasy taxa were named after him, including the plant genera Baronia, Baroniella, and Neobaronia.

History  The first Catholic church in China (Church of the Savior) was built in 1553 within the Old City of Shanghai, but was confiscated with the suppression of Catholicism in 1731, and converted into a shrine to Guan Yu and a school. In 1846, the suppression edict was rescinded, and French missionaries sought the return of the church property. The governor of Shanghai offered instead to compensate the church with three plots of land outside the city walls, at Tungkatu (Dongjiadu), Zikawei (Xujiahui), and Yang- king-pang .C.A. Montalto de Jesus (1909), Historic Shanghai, p. 30 In 1847, Fr. Ludovico Maria (die Conti) Besi, an Italian Jesuit and the Apostolic Administrator of Nanjing, decided to build a church and residence at Tong-ka- du. The Cathedral was to be constructed in the baroque style, with a design recalling Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome. Construction started in 1849 and it wasn't completed until 1853, when it was officially opened on Pentecost and dedicated to Fr. Francis Xavier. Because the church was located in the area of the Dong family owned pier (Tong-ka-du or Dongjiadu), the church was known as the Dongjiadu cathedral, a name it still holds to this day.http://www.sfx.sh/ The church was the seat of the vicar apostolic of Kiang-nan. From 1946, when Shanghai was raised to a diocese, until 1960, the Cathedral of St Francis Xavier was the seat of the bishop of Shanghai. In 1960, after the Communist takeover of Shanghai and the arrest and imprisonment of the leaders of the Shanghai Diocese, the cathedra of the Bishop of Shanghai was moved from the older but smaller Cathedral of St Francis Xavier at Dongjiadu to St Ignatius at Zikawei (Xujiahui), and Zikawei became the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shanghai. Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei, Bishop of Shanghai, had been arrested in 1955 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1960, so the move to Zikawei occurred under Aloysius Zhang Jiashu, the Bishop of Shanghai according to the Chinese government-approved \\"Catholic\\" church. Dongjiadu Cathedral was shut in 1966 at the start of the Cultural Revolution, and became a factory warehouse. In 1982, mass was resumed in a portion of the church returned to the diocese, and 1984 most of the main church was returned. The remainder of the church was returned and restored in 2005. From 2017, as part of a project to construct a new financial zone in Dongjiadu, Dongjiadu Cathedral was closed for a restoration project involving completely excavating the base of the cathedral from within and strengthening its foundations.Ëë£ÂÆ∂Ê∏°Â§©‰∏ªÂ†ÇÊä¢Èô©Âä†Âõ∫Â∑•Á®ãÂáÜÂ§áÂ∑•‰ΩúÂêØÂä® The subsidiary buildings of the cathedral will be demolished.‰∫Ü‰∏çËµ∑ÁöÑ‚Äú‰∏äÊµ∑ÈÄüÂ∫¶‚ÄùÔºöÂ§ñÊª©ÁôæÊó•ÂçáÁ∫ßËÆ∞  Location  It is located near the waterfront between the Old City of Shanghai and The Bund, on Dongjiadu Road.

It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a flat roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. The main block has extensive Italianate styling, including a bracketed cornice, paneled corner pilasters, and course of dentil moulding above the second and third floors. The first-floor storefront is in its original configuration, with recessed entrance flanked by display windows, and sheltered by an awning with wrought iron brackets. A 1990s two-story ell extends to the south, set back from the main block, and a four-story mansarded tower rises at the northeast corner. with The block was built in 1895 to house the general store of Don Pollard, replacing an earlier Federal period brick structure that had previously housed the store. The interior of the first floor retains many of its original features and fixtures, and continues to see retail use. The upper floors have been adapted for residential use, and only the floors and some window trim have survived. Pollard's store was the largest in the village until its closure in 1964.

Shaman in the local language (Burushaski) are referred as 'Bitan'. Shamanism in the area has been linked to its dynamic history.  Bitan  Bitan is the Burushaski equivalent of Shaman. Bitans are not like the Eurasian Shamans, as the Eurasian Shamans have some special physical qualities like extra teeth, a sixth finger, or other physical signs. Dayals are normal beings who are selected by the Pari (the fairy, plural '). Pariting descends to the earth during the cherry and apricot blossom seasons. Pariting choose the dayal from new borns by smelling their noses and mouths. It is not apparent who is a dayal during the childhood. Bitans grow distinct characteristics when they reach teenage. These characteristics includes becoming unconscious, going into a state of ecstasy, or sickness for days or sometimes weeks. A Bitan may die if he (his spirit) resists to be one during the period when the shamanist's characteristics start to appear. Dayal have craving for music (a special tune/composition); on listening to such music they can go into a state of trance where they meet with the pari. Bitans dance to the music during festivals like Ginani (crop harvesting festival). During the dance, dayal also foretell the next year's crop production.  Shamanic Practices  Shamans or the Dayals are believed to have foresight. This foresight is a result of Dayal's interactions with the spirits. These spirits are fairies, pari (plural ') as called in the local language. The paris tell the dayals about the future when they are in an ecstatic/trance state. Thus they foretell the future. = The Ritual = The ritual to get the dayal into the shamanistic or the ecstatic state, need music, smoke and blood of goat. Music is played by the musicians ('). The orchestra has three instruments, namely Dadang (Drum), Daamal (two hemi-spherical drums) and Surnai (Shenai) or Gabi (local variant of reed pipe). For the smoke juniper leaves and Syrian rue (local name Supandur) are put on fire. For blood the dayal drinks it from the recently chopped head of a goat (Chati). Dayal starts to dance to the music. While dancing dayal inhales the smoke of juniper leaves simultaneously. Then drinking the blood from Chati. Dayal gets into a higher state as he continues to dance to the music. Reaching the state the dayal starts to speak in Shina (language of Gilgit). Dayal converses/argues/ask the pari regarding the concern he has. During the process dayal may pass out. Dayal can go to such state for at most two or three times before he passes out.  History  Historians like M.H. Sidky, have done extensive research on the topic of Shamanism. Sidky had published a paper on Shamanism in Hunza. Where the author had mentioned the famous Bitans (shamans) of the area, including Huk Mamu and Shon Gakur. Bitans of Hunza used to tell future by doing the shamanic practices. Bitans were summoned by the Thum/Mir to predict any calamity, famine or any disaster expected in near future.

Biography Born on Crete on 22 August 1511, Portus was orphaned early. He studied in his youth with Arsenius Apostolius.P. Tavonatti, \\"Il contributo di Francesco Porto alla filologia eschilea\\", √çtaca. Quaderns Catalans de Cultura Cl√†ssica, no. 27, 2011, p. 155. He went to study in Italy thanks to the generosity of a family friend. He studied for six years in Padova, and then went to Venice, where he was admitted to the city's Greek school, where he soon became the director (\\"·ºÄœÅœáŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ¨œÉŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ∑Œ≥Œ∑œÑ·Ω¥œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºôŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ\\"). During the decade from 1526 to 1535, one should also note his important activity as a copyist of Greek manuscripts.Maria Papanicolaou, Giovanni Pugliese Carratelli, \\"Identificazione del dotto copista anonimo di un manipolo di manoscritti greci databile al decennio 1526-1535 : Francesco Porto\\", in Atti della Accademia nazionale dei Lincei. Rendiconti Classe di scienze morali storiche e filologiche, vol. 21, no. 3-4, 2010, p. 427-489. However, he was an adherent of Reformed Christianity, and certain mocking remarks that he made about the customs of traditional Christian religion, such as fasting and veneration of images, caused him to leave Venice. In 1536, Portus obtained a Chair in Greek at Modena, although he was unwilling to sign the declaration of faith which was required of public officials. In 1542, he was hired by Ren√©e of France, the Duchess of Ferrara, as tutor to her sons, and she also entrusted to him the secret correspondence that she was maintaining with John Calvin. He was admitted to the Accademia dei Filareti, founded in Ferrara in 1554, and spoke before the Duchess a speech in praise of the Greek language. After the death of the Duke of Ferrara, Ercole II d'Este, in 1559, the Duchess returned to France. In fear of the Inquisition because of his religious views, Portus left Ferrara with his family, and spent some time in the area of Friuli before settling in Geneva, becoming a citizen of Geneva in 1562. In the same year, he was appointed to the Chair of Greek at the University of Geneva, which he occupied until his death. One of his most important students was Isaac Casaubon, whom he recommended to succeed him. After the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, he had a polemical correspondence with his former colleague Pierre Charpentier, which became the instrument of French governmental propaganda and justified the massacre through the existence of a pretended plot against the royal family.Lettre de Pierre Charpentier, jurisconsulte, √† Fran√ßois Portus Candiois, par laquelle il monstre que les persecutions des √âglises de France sont advenues, non par la faulte de ceux qui faisoient profession de la Religion, mais de ceux qui nourrissoient les factions et conspirations, qu'on appelle la Cause (published late 1572); Response de Fran√ßois Candiot aux lettres diffamatoires de Pierre Carpentier advocat, pour l'innocence des fideles serviteurs de Dieu et obeissans subjects du Roy, massacrez le 24. jour d'aoust 1572, appellez factieux par ce plaidereau (letter written originally in Latin, circulated secretly in March 1573, published in French translation in 1574) Portus died in Geneva on 5 June 1581. Scholarship Portus corrected and annotated the texts of many Ancient Greek authors, and translated many into Latin, including Aristotle's Rhetoric, the treatises of Hermogenes of Tarsus, Aphthonius and pseudo-Longinus (edition printed by Jean Crespin in 1569), the Syntax of Apollonius Dyscolus, the hymns and letters of Synesius of Cyrene, and the Odes of Gregory of Nazianus. He also produced commentaries on numerous authors: Homer, Pindar, the Greek tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides), Aristophanes, Thucydides, Xenophon, Demosthenes, Theocritus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus. He provided corrections and additional remarks to the Lexicon of Robert Constantin (Geneva, 1592). Shortly after his death, his son published many further volumes of his work at Lausanne: Commentarii in Pindari Olympia, Pythia, Nemea, Isthmia (1583); six of his treatises entitled In omnes Sophoclis trag≈ìdias prolegomena, Sophoclis et Euripidis collatio, etc. (1584); and Commentarii in varia Xenophontis opuscula (1586). He also published his Rhetoric of Aristotle at Speyer in 1598. Portus' son Aemilius Portus (born in Ferrara, 13 August 1553; died in Stadthagen, 1614 or 1615) taught Greek in Geneva alongside his father from 1569, and then at Lausanne from 1581 to 1592, and then at Heidelberg from 1596 to 1608, and published numerous works (including works by his father).

He is best known as the author of the novels Sweepings and Coming Home, and the screen play for Of Human Bondage. Early life Cohen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Annie Harchovsky and Hyman Cohen from Minsk. Both emigrated to the United States in their early teens and worked in sweatshops. Hyman Cohen became a doctor, was a pioneer in public health, an officer of the Chicago Public Health Department. He later became an eye specialist and taught ophthalmology at Rush Medical College. Hyman was also a writer, authoring several books both in his specialty and two novels. Cohen went to public schools in Chicago and briefly attended the University of Chicago. He started his career as a poet, then worked at various newspapers including the Chicago Daily News and the New York Graphic in New York City (the subject of his 1964 book, The New York Graphic: The World‚Äôs Zaniest Newspaper). When he was 19, Cohen met Priscilla Pardridge (later known as Eden Gray) at a poetry reading at the literary Dil Pickle Club. Gray was a Broadway actress, radio personality, publisher and author of several books on Tarot cards and other subjects. After several dates, they agreed to move separately to NYC and then get married so that Gray could pursue a career as a Broadway actress. She left for the East Coast and he followed a few weeks later. Gray found work as an artists‚Äô model in silent films (then being made in Brooklyn), before succeeding on Broadway. Cohen worked in advertising and later got a job as contest editor for McFadden‚Äôs \\"New York Graphic\\". The New York Times mentions their wedding: 25 January 1921, \\"Society Girl Weds Poet; Priscilla Pardridge of Chicago Marries Lester Cohen in New York.\\" Her family was not pleased. The couple had a son, Peter Gray Cohen (November 12, 1925 ‚Äì September 7, 2014) who was a painter, muralist and left wing activist. Cohen later married Diana Peckham in 1947. Peckham was a mathematician who worked on early cosmic ray research. Political commitment Cohen was a member of the Dreiser Committee which visited the Kentucky coal fields in 1931 to document the labor struggles of Harlan County coal miners. John Dos Passos, Sherwood Anderson and other notable American writers were also on this committee and contributed to the written report produced by Dreiser. Cohen was a member of the League of American Writers, an affiliation of communists and communist sympathizers that was active between 1935 and 1943. Cohen represented the American League for a Free Palestine at the first United Nations Conference in San Francisco in 1945. Cohen was a founding member of the Screen Writers‚Äô Guild and was a member of the Authors‚Äô Guild of America from 1926 to his death in 1963. Writing career Cohen was the author of nine published books, two (or more) unpublished works (including The Fabulous World of Horace Liveright about the founder of Boni-Liveright Publishers and his circle, and Fallen Nation, an epic unfinished at the time of his death); six full-length stage plays, many short plays and scripts for television; poetry; articles and stories for periodicals; reviews and editorials for Variety; and many screen plays and treatments for motion pictures.

Unveiled in 1921, the memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, based on his design for the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, and is today a grade II* listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic war memorials. The Royal Berkshire Regiment memorial is one of seven cenotaphs in England designed by Lutyens besides the one on Whitehall, and one of two to serve as a memorial for a regiment (the other being the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment Cenotaph in Maidstone, though the Welch Regiment War Memorial in Cardiff, Wales, is also a regimental memorial in the form of a cenotaph). The Royal Berkshire Regiment quickly decided that it wanted a copy of Whitehall's cenotaph for its own war memorial and duly commissioned Lutyens, who appears to have been happy to design reduced-scale version of the cenotaph to accommodate for smaller budgets, unlike the Stone of Remembrance, which he insisted must never be reduced in size. The Royal West Kent memorial was built to two-thirds scale, while the Royal Berkshire's version is half size. History and design The memorial was built by GE Wallis and Sons Ltd of Maidstone, who also built the Royal West Kent Regiment's memorial, at a cost of ¬£3,000 (1921). Major General Edward Thompson Dickson, the colonel of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, unveiled the cenotaph on 13 September 1921.Skelton, p. 175 The regiment's roll of honour was placed inside the cenotaph during the unveiling ceremony.Skelton, p. 91. Customary for a Lutyens memorial, the cenotaph stands on a base of three steps and is in Portland stone; it is situated on a lawned area within Brock Barracks, formerly the headquarters of the Royal Berkshire Regiment. At the very top of the structure is an urn‚Äîa feature Lutyens originally proposed or the cenotaph on Whitehall and which features on the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester. The urn sits on top of a chest tomb, and a three-staged base connects it to the main shaft, which is set back slightly towards the top; the shaft itself is moulded onto a base of two rectangular blocks. Although richer than other memorials, the cenotaph is still sparsely decorated. Attached to it are two painted stone flags carved by Eric Broadbent‚Äîthe King's Colour on the west side and the regiment's colour on the east‚Äîwhich are joined to moulded wreaths on the ends by laurel swags. Painted flags featured in Lutyens' original proposal for the Whitehall cenotaph (Lutyens proposed six, though the Royal Berkshire Regiment's memorial only features two), but were rejected in favour of fabric, though they feature on several of his other memorials.Skelton, p. 89. On the north face, the memorial is inscribed: \\"TO THE MEMORY OF OFFICERS, WARRANT OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND MEN OF THE ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGIMENT\\", while the south side reads: \\"THIS MEMORIAL WAS ERECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGIMENT AND THEIR RELATIVES IN MEMORY OF THE 353 OFFICERS AND 6375 OTHER RANKS OF THE REGIMENT WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914 ‚Äì 1918 / RE-DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF THE 93 OFFICERS AND 974 OTHER RANKS OF THE REGIMENT WHO FELL IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR 1939 ‚Äì 1945\\". The names of the dead are inscribed on a wall to the north of the cenotaph. The memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 22 December 1975. In October 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded. As part of this process, the Royal Berkshire Regiment memorial was upgraded to grade II* listed building status, as was the Royal West Kent's memorial in Maidstone.

It currently is one of the oldest buildings still standing in Shanghai. The building was various a private Chinese residence, a Catholic church, a Taoist temple, and an elementary school throughout its history. The church had a thriving congregation of parishioners up until 1950s, when its religious activities were ceased after the Chinese Communist Revolution. Since then, its buildings had undergone many uses, including serving as an elementary school. The buildings are currently closed to visitors as they are under the threat of collapse.  History  The church building was built a private residence in 1553 by the Shanghai-raised governor of Sichuan Pan Yunduan (ÊΩòÂÖÅÁ´Ø), a governor of Sichuan, for his father Pan En (ÊΩòÊÅ©), named the Ever-Spring Hall (‰∏ñÊò•Â†Ç) . Pan Yunduan also constructed the nearby famous Yu Garden in Shanghai for his father, and these buildings are all found in the same complex which was formerly the Pan family estate. Due to the decline of the Pan family, the hall was sold off to another family, the Fan (ËåÉ) family. in 1640, the building was purchased by Martina Pan, the granddaughter of Xu Guangqi, one of the early influential Shanghai Catholic converts, for the sake of Fr. Francesco Brancati (ÊΩòÂõΩÂÖâ), an Italian Jesuit missionary, and converted into a church. At this time the building's name was changed to Jingyi Church (Êï¨‰∏ÄÂ†Ç), meaning \\"Hall of the Only Respected\\". It was called The Church of the Savior in English. At that time men and women were not allowed to attend mass at the same place, so women attended at the Church of Our Lady near Xujiazui. A side hall for astronomical observations were added and the church became a center for Catholicism in Shanghai. In 1665, Yang Guangxian‚Äôs attacks on Christianity caused it to be banned in the realm. Fr. Brancati left Shanghai for Guangzhou after having took up the frock in Shanghai for 28 years. At this time, the building became an office of an official of the Coastal Defense, Dong Caogao. In 1671, the ban was lifted and the Jesuits returned. However, in 1724, the Yongzheng Emperor again banned Catholicism and other foreign religions in China. Thus, in 1731, the church building was confiscated and turned into a Taoist temple dedicated to the God of War, Guan Yu. In 1748, a Shenjiang Academy was built near the site. With end of the Opium War in 1844, Christianity was again legalized in the country. An imperial edict requested that all old confiscated church lands be returned to the church, except those that had been converted into temples. Thus it wasn't until 1860 under the Treaty of Tianjin demands when the church buildings were returned to the Catholic Church. The War God temple moved to the present location of the No.3 Primary School on East Fuxing Road in Shanghai. The Shenjiang academy also moved east, while the Academy's old buildings were converted into a Catholic school named St. Berchaman‚Äôs school. In 1938, a Shangzhi primary school (‰∏äÊô∫Â∞èÂ≠¶)was establied on the site in the 1930s. At that time, the church had about 600 parishioners. The church operated there until religious activities were banned in 1950, after the Chinese Communist Revolution. The church school would later be renamed Wutong Road Primary School in 1953 after the Communist revolution, and the main church hall would be used as a gym. In 1959, the building of the Catholic church was added to a list of Cultural Heritage sites in Shanghai city, and subsequently removed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. The title was restored on May 18, 1981. At this time until the late 1990s, it was used as the primary school gymnasium; it is currently unused.https://www.academia.edu/19859102/The_Old_Catholic_Church_in_Shanghai_A_350-year- old_Treasure  See also  * List of Catholic cathedrals in China * Yu Garden  References  Shanghai Cathedrals in Shanghai Roman Catholic cathedrals in China Roman Catholic churches in Shanghai Huangpu District, Shanghai ","title":"Jingyi Church"},{"id":"51260502","text":"Careful With That Axe is the seventh solo album by John 5. It was released on August 12, 2014, and debuted at no. 50 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The album's first and only single, \\"This is My Rifle\\", was released two months prior on June 17, 2014. Background and recording Work on the album took place in between his work as a touring guitarist for Rob Zombie. Recording took place in \\"The Doghouse Studios\\" in Los Angeles. With it being his seventh instrumental studio album, John 5 desired to mix his process up from the past. Historically, he had recorded all guitar and bass guitar parts himself, and hired a studio drummer to \\"Keep the beat and stay out of [his] way\\". For Careful With That Axe, he recruited a dedicated bassist, Matt Bissonette, to play all bass parts, and had a co-producer Rodger Carter play all drum tracks, with both players being more interactive in the process. Both were experienced studio musicians, with Bissonette having previously recorded with Elton John and David Lee Roth, and Carter having previously recorded with Lita Ford and Gene Simmons. Composition and themes John 5 described the album as having \\"a real live band sound\\" that covers a broad spectrum of different music genre. The track \\"This Is My Rifle\\" is a tribute to Al Di Meola, while \\"El Cucuy\\" is a tribute to Spanish flamenco guitar music. \\"Jerry's Breakdown\\" and \\"Jiffy Jam\\" are both cover songs of Jerry Reed, a musician John 5 was familiar with due to his father listening to his albums as a child. The album's title pays homage to Pink Floyd's 1968 psychedelic track \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\", while also making a pun on the slang term \\"axe\\", meaning a guitar. Both the album's title and many of its individual song titles are references to axe murders. \\"This Is My Rifle\\" is a reference to Stanley Kubrick and Full Metal Jacket, \\"Flight of the Vulcan Valley\\" is a reference to Flight of the Bumble Bee. \\"El Cucuy\\" is Spanish for the \\"bogeyman\\", while \\"Portrait of Sidney Sloan\\", \\"Villisca\\", and \\"The Dream Slayer\\" all refer to specific real- life murders. Promotion and release The album's first single, \\"This is My Rifle\\", was released on June 17, 2014, two months prior to the album's release. The album released on August 12, 2014 through record label 60 Cycle Hum.

Having such a unique number would have the benefits of being language-independent and system-independent. Francoise Bourdon was a major proponent of such a standard, proposing a structure for the ISADN and recommending that the number uniquely identify authority records, rather than their subjects. A 1989 article by Delsey described the work on the IFLA Working Group on an International Authority System, spending a good portion of time on conceptualizing an international standard number \\"that will facilitate the linkage of variant authorities for the same identity.\\" Their discussion was very complex in its discussion of which agencies would actually assign such numbers. For example, a national library might be tasked with assigning identifiers to authors within its country, but this would lead to duplicate identifiers for authority data that describe transnational people. The project was ultimately determined to be unfeasible. Tillett suggested that the cluster identifiers used by the Virtual International Authority File might meet the needs expressed in the proposal. The concept of an ISADN continues to be relevant to the information science community, as it could be a great help in the problem of measuring an individual author's research output.

He plays guitar and composes in the ensemble Zs, described by The New York Times as \\"one of the strongest avant-garde bands in New York.\\" His work as composer traverses the styles of the European avant-garde and the tradition of post-minimalist Downtown New York music. He has received attention for his unique style of guitar playing and his work as a composer, heralded as \\"one of the most gifted guitarists working today\\" (The Quietus) and a \\"formidable concert music composer\\" (The Boston Globe). After a performance at South By Southwest music festival in Austin, TX he was named the \\"best guitarist of the 2013 event\\" by Premier Guitar Magazine. Biography Higgins was born in 1984 in Manhattan and attended high school at the Urban School of San Francisco. He returned to New York City in 2002 to attend Columbia University, earning a B.A. in Philosophy and an M.A. in Comparative Literature. Higgins joined long-running New York ensemble Zs in the summer of 2012, helping to embark on a busy schedule of touring and recording in 2013 and 2014. The new group's premier concert was reviewed by the New York Times in August 2012, with Ben Ratliff writing \\"It‚Äôs never wanted to be one thing, and now, with the addition of the guitarist Patrick Higgins and the drummer Greg Fox, it‚Äôs something else again.\\" During this period Zs toured extensively through North America on three occasions, and toured internationally across 20 countries, including four tours of Europe and a tour of Japan in early 2013. The first recording to feature Higgins and new member Greg Fox was Zs' 2014 release \\"Grain\\", released on Northern-Spy Records. Higgins co-composed, played guitar, and produced Zs' 2015 record Xe, which is the band's most critically acclaimed record to date. Xe earned an 8.0 from Pitchfork, the highest score yet given to Zs by the prominent music magazine. The Wall Street Journal described the group's performance on 'Xe' as \\"hypnotic and harsh at once, with an ability to mesmerize while keeping a listener at attention.\\" At the end of 2015, Rolling Stone named Xe number 3 on its list of the Best Avant-Garde Records of the year. The album and artwork for Xe were purchased by the SF MOMA and are part of the museum's permanent collection. As a composer, he has written numerous works for string quartet, chamber orchestra, and solo instruments. In 2013, a double LP of Higgins' String Quartet No.2 was released on Ex Cathedra Records, along with a work entitled Glacia, an electronic re-composition of the string quartet performance. NNA Tapes released the Social Death Mixtape in the fall of 2015, a record presenting a wide array of Higgins' avant-garde works of Chamber Music and featuring compositions for harpsichord, string ensemble, solo violin, guitar, and electronics. Tiny Mix Tapes gave Social Death Mixtape 4 out of 5 stars, citing the record as a \\"masterful brand of de-composition\\". Later that year, Telegraph Harp released Higgins' Bachanalia, an electro-acoustic record of classical guitar performances of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The record features a series of acoustic guitar performances, each electronically processed and re-amplified in differing ways. Bachanalia was heralded as a \\"masterpiece\\" and a virtuoso recording and helped to solidify Higgins' reputation as among the most innovative guitarists of his era. The recording of the album took place in two different churches, one in Brooklyn, New York and one in Hudson, New York, with the quality of space and natural reverb entering in as a feature of the musical performance. The recording \\"winds up as an outstanding album of classical music that also happens to explore the same ideas and notions regarding space that inspired Alvin Lucier [...]\\". September 2017 saw the release of a collaborative recording called \\"EVRLY MVSIC\\", released on NNA Tapes. The record featured semi-improvised acoustic duets of Higgins on guitar and violinist Josh Modney of the International Contemporary Ensemble. In 2016, Higgins composed the score for the feature film As You Are (dir. by Miles Joris-Peyrafitte), which was awarded the prestigious Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. On November 3 and 4, 2016, Pioneer Works presented a multi-media concert and art installation of Higgins' chamber music in Red Hook, Brooklyn entitled TOCSIN: Three New Works by Patrick Higgins. The concert featured Higgins' third string quartet composition SQ3 performed by the Mivos Quartet, as well as the world premiere of TOCSIN performed by virtuoso pianist Vicky Chow and the world premiere of Emptyset [0,0] for chamber orchestra, performed by the Wet Ink Ensemble. The concert featured an immersive sculptural and video art installation which was developed by Higgins in collaboration with the acclaimed visual artist Tauba Auerbach, architect Alexander Arroyo, and set designer/projectionist Ken Farmer. For TOCSIN, Auerbach created a series of hanging sculptures that were suspended from the ceiling and placed in front of three large film screens above the stage. From the balcony of the concert hall, projectors were used to map video content developed by Arroyo onto the screens and sculptures surrounding the musicians. The video content was specifically created to react to three pieces of Higgins' music. Wet Ink Ensemble performing Higgins' work \\"Emptyset [0,0]\\" from TOCSIN, at Pioneer Works, Brooklyn NY, November 2016 Over the course of 2015 and 2016, Higgins joined with legendary No-Wave auteur Arto Lindsay to play guitar and assist in arrangement and production for Lindsay's forthcoming studio record, \\"Cuidado Madame\\", recorded in Brooklyn at Strange Weather Studios. The album was released on Northern-Spy Records in the spring of 2017. Higgins also played guitar for Cibo Matto's Miho Hatori, on her forthcoming solo record \\"Miss Info\\", recorded in residence at Pioneer Works in the summer of 2016. On November 10, 2017 Higgins travelled to the Le Guess Who? Festival in Holland to premier a new work entitled \\"Hyperborea\\". The piece, written for string orchestra and live electronics, was performed by the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and included a new arrangement of Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo's \\"Tenebrae Responsories\\" for strings. In April 2018, Nicolas Jaar announced that his record label Other People would be releasing Higgins' forthcoming solo LP \\"Dossier\\". After a solo concert tour across Europe in May 2018, \\"Dossier\\" was released on June 1, 2018. Exclaim! magazine reviewed the record, issuing a score of 9/10 and calling the work \\"an album filled to the brim with emotion filtered through inhuman and dissonant sounds\\" with \\"an incredibly unique aesthetic.\\" Inverted Audio magazine remarked that Higgins has been \\"dedicating himself to pushing the boundaries of electronic music as did his most notorious predecessors Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and John Cage with classical music, Higgins keeps driving the common rhythmic/melodic acceptations of our time into the corner, shattering the unyielding myths and misconceptions attached to the notions of harmony and dissonance on his way.\\" The record has been noted as \\"one of Higgins‚Äô most accomplished works to date\\". Higgins subsequently toured the music from Dossier across Europe, Japan, and North America in 2018 and 2019, including a multimedia rendition of the work at the Merriweather Post Pavilion which featured choreography by Monica Mirabile of Fluct and sculpture by light-based visual artist Matthew Schreiber. Producer In the fall of 2013, Higgins founded Future-Past Studios in upstate New York. The studio is home to a renowned collection of analog recording equipment and housed in an historic Lutheran church from the 19th century. He has worked as a record producer, engineer, and studio owner, and since the studio's opening has recorded over 60 records, including work with Dither Quartet and John Zorn, Vicky Chow of Bang on a Can, The Last Shadow Puppets (Arctic Monkeys), The National, War On Drugs, Zs, Gang Gang Dance, Amanda Palmer, Jherek Bischoff, Josephine Foster, Mivos Quartet, TAK Ensemble, Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire, and numerous film scores.

Background The attack was one of a series of attacks on Belgian police officers in 2016, including the stabbing of two officers on 7 September 2016 in Molenbeek and the 5 October 2016 stabbing of Brussels police officers. Stabbing According to the accounts of Belgian police and prosecutors, the attack began just before 4:00 p.m., when the perpetrator approached two officers stationed at the checkpoint at the front of the police headquarters, immediately pulled a machete from the sports bag he carried and swung it violently toward the officer's heads. A third officer posted nearby shot the assailant. The attacker is reported to have said \\"Allahu Akbar\\" during the attack. Prime Minister Charles Michel said the incident is believed to be a terrorist attack, which would make it the first terrorist attack in Belgium since the Brussels bombings in March. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack. Perpetrator The attacker was a 33-year-old Algerian man who had a criminal record. He had lived in Belgium illegally from 2012 until his death. He attended the mosque at Farciennes. Belgian authorities have released the perpetrator's initials, K.B., but have not released his name. Media outlets released the man's name as Khaled Babbouri. Two deportation orders had been issued for the perpetrator, but not carried out because Algeria and Belgium lack a diplomatic agreement under which Algerian citizens can be involuntarily sent back to Algeria. The perpetrator was not securely detained because Belgium has fewer spaces in secure detention facilities than individuals for whom deportation orders have been issued. Victims Both victims were policewomen (Corinne and Hakima). One suffered an injury to her jaw and had to undergo a second operation to avoid facial paralysis. Another suffered a \\"large facial scar\\", and had life- threatening injuries. Both were operated in hospital as emergency cases. Investigation Interior minister Jan Jambon stated that OCAM (Organ for Coordination for Analysis of Threats) is evaluating the attack \\"to determine if it is terrorism.\\" A \\"social housing\\" home was visited by the police the evening of the attack and further investigated by federal police, an evidence unit, and a bomb squad the following day. Le Soir reported that an Algerian family live at the residence. Reaction King Philippe of Belgium visited the victims and the site of the attack. The Mouvement R√©formateur party presented a law on the Belgian Parliament that Belgian foreign aid be withheld from countries that don't allow the repatriation of their own citizens who are illegal immigrants in Belgium, and the Charleroi attack was cited as an example.

Opening in 1964 and arrow-shaped with a 120-foot concrete spire, the congregation are seated in a semi-circle facing the altar. The church building is in the style of the Liturgical Movement following World War II. It was Grade II listed in 2015 for \\"its striking architectural form, expressed through a diverse range of materials to provide an innovative building of real quality both in composition and detailing.\\"Church of St George with garden walls, steps and three concrete benches - Historic England website History For about 850 years the parish church for the village of Norton was the Church of St Nicholas, but as more and more houses were built in the area and Norton gradually became a suburb of Letchworth the need for a larger church in the area became apparent and a design for a large Gothic style church and hall were put forward. However, only the hall was built, opening in 1915 and being used for worship for about 50 years. After World War II the nearby Grange Estate was built and the need for a new church became even more pressing. From 1955 to the early 1960s local people regularly contributed towards the cost of building a new church.History of St George's Church - The Parish of Norton, Letchworth Garden City websiteGiles, Deborah, St George‚Äôs Church, Parish of Norton, Letchworth Garden City, (2003) Design font St George's church was built to the design of the architect Peter Bosanquet (1918-2005) of Brett, Boyd and Bosanquet architects. Bosanquet also designed much of the church's furniture and fittings, including the pews, which were crafted from African utile wood. The church is considered to be Bosanquet‚Äôs \\"most innovative and successful design.\\" In addition, he designed the churchwardens‚Äô wands, all the candle holders and stands and the hymn board, which were made at the nearby Norton School. The fibreglass sculpture of Christ suspended over the altar was designed by the sculptor Harry R Phillips (1911-1976) and was intended to represent the Resurrection and the Ascension. Building work on the triangular piece of land began in August 1962 with the firm of J T Openshaw Ltd of Letchworth as the main contractors; the final cost was ¬£46,000. The foundation stone was laid by John Trillo, the Bishop of Bedford on 27 April 1963, with the church being consecrated on 27 July 1964 by Michael Gresford Jones, Bishop of St Albans. The church \\"is unconventional in its form, with an arrow-shaped plan and fan-shaped seating arrangement focusing on a forward altar and communion rail at the north-east end\\" which enables the entire congregation to have an uninterrupted view. The use of unadorned concrete and natural wood were intended as a reminder of the simplicity and poverty of the life of Christ. The circular black concrete font is placed around the only pillar in the church, to symbolise that as the pillar physically supports the church so does baptism support the Church. Nikolaus Pevsner wrote of the church: > \\"An ingenious and impressive design, well fitted to its corner site. The > large sweeping roof continues the vernacular spirit of the early houses. > Only the exterior textures are a little disappointing. Particularly notable > is the integration of structure and fittings. The tall concrete spire, > formed of two sides of a triangle, shelters a roof light, and penetrates > through the roof to serve as a backdrop for altar and crucifix. The roof is > supported at the w(est) end by a concrete pier, around which is the font, > like a large shaft ring.

Local newspaper The Daily Comet pointed out that Larpenter's wife is employed by the same insurance business.

Biography  = Early years and youth = Antonio Soto was born on 8 October 1897 in the Galician village of Ferrol (La Coru√±a) to Antonio Soto and Concepci√≥n Canalejo. He arrived in Buenos Aires when he was 13 years old. Fatherless, he began a life of misery and privation in Argentina. Soto was unable to complete much of primary school. He worked in a diverse variety of jobs, suffering exploitation and punishments. Ever since he was a boy, he was attracted to anarchist ideas, particularly those of the syndicalists. In 1914, when Soto was 17 years old, Soto refused to join the Spanish militia to go and fight Morocco. In 1919 he embarked with the theater company Serrano-Mendoza, which visited the different Patagonic ports in Argentina and Chile. In January 1920, a popular rebellion broke out in Trelew, Chubut. It began with a strike by commercial employees which grew in support by most of the population against the governor, the police, and the large traders. Soto arrived and began to agitate and support the striking workers, which lead to his arrest and expulsion from Chubut. Soon after he arrived in R√≠o Gallegos, where the militant labor climate that reigned in the city attracted him. = Early Political career = Before and after the theatrical performances, Soto attended meetings of la Sociedad Obrera de R√≠o Gallegos (Workers Society of R√≠o Gallegos). There he would listen to Doctor Jos√© Mar√≠a Borrero who was a captivating orator, who suggested Soto stay and join the union. Borrero had realized that Soto was a militant who had a good ideological foundation and who knew how to express himself in the union's assemblies. Soto abandoned the theater company and settled in Patagonia, where he enrolled as a longshoreman to work in the port. Workers Society of R√≠o Gallegos. On 24 May 1920 he was chosen as Secretary General of the Workers Society of R√≠o Gallegos. In July of that year the Workers Society, in agreement with all of the unions in the rest of the province of Santa Cruz, declared a strike of all hotel personnel and dockworkers, demanding improved wages. While the dockworkers lost the strike, but the union of waiters, peasants and cooks of the hotels continued. = Involvement in the First Patagonic Strike = The situation at the beginning of 1921 was as follows: the strike in R√≠o Gallegos and Puerto Deseado was a general strike. In addition, they had declared a boycott of three shops. On 16 January, the marine Malerba, under orders of the governor Edelmiro Correa Falc√≥n began a suppression of the striking workers. The advisor of the Workers Society, Jos√© Mar√≠a Borrero, is detained, along with other members, but Soto was able to avoid arrest. Soto traveled clandestinely to Buenos Aires to discuss the situation in the union congress. The Organizaci√≥n Obrera, the official newspaper of the syndicalist FORA, published news of his arrival. He participated in the national congress as a delegate of the Workers Society of R√≠o Gallegos, where he sought support and solidarity for the conflict in Santa Cruz. The congress, with representatives from across the country, occurred in La Plata from 29 January until 5 February. Soto criticized the congress for the lack of solidarity for the labor movement in Patagonia. The Radical government of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, allied with the big landowners, sent the army to Patagonia, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel H√©ctor Benigno Varela to evaluate the developing situation. Upon arrival and evaluation of what led up to the strike, Varela informed the government that the landowners were at fault for the exploitation that they subjected the rural workers to and that they ought to improve working conditions. He obligated both sides to lay down their arms and for the landowners to comply with the workers' demands. Upon completion of his duties, Varela returned to Buenos Aires. = Involvement in the Second Patagonic Strike = The landowners refused to comply with the agreement and continued with the layoffs, held the back pay, and maintained the poor working conditions. Soto led the Workers Society to strike for an indefinite period of time. On 25 March 1921, a general strike was declared. The landowners and the outgoing governor Correa agitated for the return of Lieutenant Colonel Varela to Santa Cruz, whereupon he began to repress and massacre the striking workers. On 15 September 1921, Soto and his comrades depart, heading towards the farms of the cordillera of the Andes in a long journey with cars and horses. On 31 October, he had managed to incorporate into the movement the rural workers of several large farms, driving the southeast of Santa Cruz into an uprising. They requisitioned arms and food for the campaign, granting vouchers promising to eventually return the goods and occasionally taking the landowners and managers hostage. On 5 November, all of the farms in the south of Santa Cruz were totally paralyzed. Workers took control of the roads, moving in columns of 60, 100, and 200 men who marched under the black and red flag. Soto met with the anarchist militants Gra√±a, Sambucetti and Mongilnitzky, whereupon they decided that while Soto would continue leading the movement in the countryside, the latter three would try to enter R√≠o Gallegos to replace the arrested leaders and to serve as a point of support within the city. When the three men entered R√≠o Gallegos, they were beaten and arrested by the police. Meanwhile, the workers columns of Pintos, Ram√≥n Outerello, and Albino Arg√ºelles were attacked by the soldiers of Varela, suffering dozens of casualties. The movement was divided into two parts: the column of Antonio Soto and the column of Jos√© Font (better known as Fac√≥n Grande). Until the beginning of December, Soto had dominated all the area south of Argentino Lake and of the Viedma Lake, and his contingent was the biggest (with around 600 workers). They operated from the estancia La Anita.Osvaldo Bayer, La Patagonia Rebelde. Tomo II, p. 195-238, Booket, Buenos Aires, 2004, . On 7 December, the army was nearby and the workers met in an assembly. Juan Farina, a Chilean worker, proposed that they surrender to the army and a majority of the peasants supported the decision. Soto argued that it was necessary to continue the strike, but ultimately agrees to send two men to parley with the army and to discuss surrender, guarantees, and the fulfilment of the terms of the agreement made by Varela the year before. Upon arrival at the military encampment, the two men were immediately executed.Osvaldo Bayer, La Patagonia Rebelde. Tomo II, Booket, Buenos Aires, 2004, . When the army arrived at estancia La Anita and demanded the unconditional surrender of all of the striking workers. The leaders of the strike met in an assembly, where Soto gave a dramatic speech but was ultimately ignored by a majority of the assembly, who eventually decided to surrender and end the strike. Upon their surrender, Varela's troops executed a large number of the workers. Soto and twelve men escaped on horseback to Chile and was never captured by the authorities.Bayer, Osvaldo (2007): ¬´La segunda vuelta de Antonio Soto¬ª, art√≠culo del 13 de octubre de 2007 en el diario P√°gina/12 (Buenos Aires). = Life in Chile and Final years = Soto with his daughter Isabel. The Argentine military and Carabiniers of Chile pursued Soto for five days, but he managed to hide in Puerto Natales and was able to escape to Punta Arenas on a schooner, protected by allies in the Federaci√≥n Obrera de Magallanes, a local trade union. Fearing capture, he escaped on a boat and made his was to Valpara√≠so with the ultimate destination of Iquique in the north of Chile where he worked in a saltpeter refinery. The difficult working conditions took a toll on his health, leading him to return to Valpara√≠so. In 1933 he traveled incognito to R√≠o Gallegos to explain his involvement in the 1921 strike, where he made contact with his comrades and prepared an act that was, compared to the previous strike, a disaster. Soto was immediately expelled from the province by the governor Gregores. In exile, he became less militant but never broke with anarchism.Bayer, Osvaldo (2004): La Patagonia Rebelde, tomo III, p√°gs. 203‚Äì240. Buenos Aires: Booket, 2004. Soto settled in Punta Arenas and managed a small hotel, which served as a meeting place of libertarians, intellectuals, and free-thinkers. He also founded the Centro Republicano Espa√±ol, the Centro Gallego, a branch of the Red Cross, and a cinema named Libertad. On 11 May 1963, Soto died in Punta Arenas at age 65. His funeral was attended by libertarians, republicans, and students (Soto had inspired the first students' strike in Punta Arena in support of a higher wage for teachers). His tombstone can be found in the Cementerio Municipal de Punta Arenas. In his hometown, Ferrol (Galicia), there is a street named after him.

After taking a land dispute to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Wapixana became the first indigenous lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court of Brazil. She is the current president of the National Commission for the Defense of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She was elected federal deputy for the state of Roraima, from the party list of the Sustainability Network (REDE), in the 2018 general election. Batista de Carvalho is the first indigenous woman elected to the Chamber of Deputies and the second indigenous federal deputy since the election of M√°rio Juruna in 1982. Early life Jo√™nia was born in the Brazilian state of Roraima and grew up in isolated Amazonian villages like Truar√∫ or Guariba, where traditional ways of life flourished and few of the elders spoke Portuguese. When her parents were brought from their village to register their births and those of their children, a clerk chose the official name Jo√™nia Batista de Carvalho for her identification papers. She identifies herself by her first name and her tribal affiliation as Jo√™nia Wapixana. By the time she was seven or eight, Jo√™nia's father had left the family and her mother moved to the state capital, Boa Vista, seeking economic opportunities. The children were enrolled in school, though three older brothers dropped out to go to work. Jo√™nia completed her high school education in the early 1990s and initially considered becoming a doctor, as she was uninterested in the usual avenue for educated indigenous women, teaching. She enrolled in law school, working nights in an accounting office to pay her way through school. In 1997, Jo√™nia graduated from the Federal University of Roraima (UFRR) as the first indigenous lawyer in Brazil. Career Batista de Carvalho began working in the legal department of the Indigenous Council of Roraima (CIR). In 2004, she filed an action with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, asking them to compel the Brazilian government to officially set out the boundaries of the Indigenous Territory of the Raposa Serra do Sol, which are the traditional homelands of the Ingarik√≥, Makuxi, Patamona, Taurepang, and Wapixana peoples. In 2005, the Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) ratified the boundaries of the reserve and declared it an environmental conservation area in which native rights were constitutionally protected, but altercations between loggers, miners and the native communities continued. In 2008, Batista de Carvalho became the first aboriginal lawyer to argue before the STF. The case concerned whether the government had the right to divide the lands of the Raposa Serra do Sol into fragmented areas to support claims to the land by prospectors and rice producers. Batista de Carvalho argued that the constitution forbade such divisions and would be a violation of the protections in the constitution for ineidgenous rights. On 19 March 2009, the STF, in a vote of ten to one, confirmed the exclusive right of the Indians to occupy and use the reserve lands of Raposa Serra do Sol. In 2013, she was appointed as the first president of the recently created National Commission for the Defense of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The post was created by the Order of Attorneys of Brazil as a means of monitoring legislation which might impact native rights. The role of the commission is to support and intervene if need be in legal matters of the lower courts or Supreme Court in cases which impact indigenous rights. Awards and recognition Batista de Carvalho received the Reebok Human Rights Award in 2004 and in 2010 was honored with the Ordem do M√©rito Cultural by the Brazilian government. In 2018 she was awarded the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights.

It was originally planned to send several companies to help, but due to the success of war, only one company was sent, Compagnie Borgelin. The company consisted of approximately 200 men with Captain Iver de Hemmer Gudme as corps commander and Captain Richard Gustav Borgelin as company commander. DBAC left 26 March 1919 for Hanko in Finland on board the Finnish ship M/S Merkur. DBAC was contracted by the Estonian Army and participated on its side in the months of May to August 1919 during the Estonian War of Independence and the Latvian War of Independence. During the months of May and June DBAC conducted a long push from V√µru in southern Estonia to Jakobstadt in Latvia, and ultimately the Daugava River, to cut off the Bolshevik's eastern supply lines. After the successful campaign, the DBAC was pulled back to Estonia, since the political conflicts between Baltische Landeswehr and the Latvian Army was not part of the contract. At the end of July 1919 DBAC was sent to a section of the eastern front between Ostrov and Porkhov in the Russian Pskov Governorate, which turned out to be a bloody experience and costly to the corps (four dead, twenty wounded and four prisoners of war).

Dragiƒçeviƒá was born in Tje≈°ilo, a village near Fojnica in Ottoman Bosnia, and studied in present-day Italy. After the death of the first Bosnian apostolic vicar, Mato Deliviƒá, Dragiƒçeviƒá was nominated to the post by Vicko Zmajeviƒá, Archbishop of Zadar. Pope Benedict XIV approved the nomination on 14 November 1740. He was appointed bishop of Duvno on 15 December and consecrated by Zmajeviƒá on 29 June 1741. Early in his vicariate, in 1741‚Äì1743, Dragiƒçeviƒá made an extensive census of Catholic households in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which he sent to the Archbishop of Zadar. The census records, for which he is best known, have survived and present a valuable insight into 18th-century demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1752, Bishop Dragiƒçeviƒá requested that the prophet Elijah replace George of Lydda as patron saint of \\"Bosnian Kingdom\\". The reason for his plea to the Holy See is not clear. He may have believed Elijah to be more suitable because of his importance to all three main religious groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina ‚Äì Catholics, Muslims and Orthodox Christians. The Pope is said to have approved Dragiƒçeviƒá's request with the remark that a wild nation deserved a wild patron. Neither the Bishop's letter nor the Pope's response have been made public by the Vatican Secret Archives. Bishop Dragiƒçeviƒá's vicariate was marked with political instability in Bosnia Eyalet. Since the Ottomans victory over the invading Habsburg Empire at the Battle of Banja Luka in 1737, Bosnian Muslims were becoming considerably less tolerant towards the Christians, but Dragiƒçeviƒá was even more threatened by the ambitious Patriarch of Constantinople and Bosnian Orthodox clergy, who sought to expand their jurisdiction over the Catholics. In 1743, Dragiƒçeviƒá was imprisoned in Fojnica, and his life was often in peril. He thus requested to be relieved of his duties in 1766, which was granted on 30 June. Succeeded by Marijan Bogdanoviƒá, Dragiƒçeviƒá retired to the Franciscan monastery in Fojnica. Despite illness, he was forced to resume administration of the vicariate between Bogdanoviƒá's death in 1772 and the appointment of his successor. Dragiƒçeviƒá died on 14 February 1773 and was buried in the Franciscan church in Fojnica.

Since 1894 it has been in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg (inventory number 763 kg). Probably made between 825 and 850 in northern France by an unknown craftsman, it is 73 cm high, studded with gold and set with gems and coloured glass. It is one of the few surviving examples of a crux gemmata from the Carolingian period. These crosses were used in Christian liturgy between the 5th and 12th centuries, placed on the altar but without a figure of Christ. Their symbolic meaning and the impression given from a distance was more important than the cross' value and so (as here) coloured glass was also used alongside gemstones.
