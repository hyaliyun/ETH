Some African traditional social organizations are male centered and male dominated. Afrikaner religious beliefs, too, include a strong emphasis on the theoretically biblically based notion that women's contributions to society should normally be approved by, or be on behalf of, men. Modern sexism and Christianity were introduced into South Africa by the ancestors of the Afrikaner diaspora. 20th century economic and political developments presented South African women with both new obstacles and new opportunities to wield influence. For example, labor force requirements in cities and mining areas have often drawn men away from their homes for months at a time, and, as a result, women have borne many traditionally male responsibilities in the village and home. Women have had to guarantee the day-to-day survival of their families and to carry out financial and legal transactions that otherwise would have been reserved for men. Women and Apartheid Apartheid imposed new restrictions on African women beginning in the 1950s. Many lived in squalor in the former homelands, where malnutrition, illness, and infant mortality were much higher than in urban areas. Other women who followed their husbands into cities or mining areas lived in inadequate, and often legal, many women are forced to do house work and housing near industrial compounds. Women often left their own families to commute long distances to plow-wage jobs in the domestic work force in white neighborhoods. Substantial numbers were temporary workers in agriculture; and a growing number of women joined the burgeoning industrial work force, as has been carefully researched in Iris Berger's 'Threads of Solidarity: Women in South African Industry', 1900-1990. Women became the major source of resistance to many race-related restrictions during the apartheid era, especially the pass laws, which required Africans to carry documents permitting them to be in white-occupied areas. The Women's Defence of the Constitution League, later known as the Black Sash, was formed in 1955, first to demonstrate against such laws and later to assist pass-law violators. Black Sash established pass-law advice centers in many cities and helped reduce sentences or assist violators in other ways. The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL), formed in 1943, was able to organize more than 20,000 women to march on government buildings in Pretoria to protest against the pass laws and other apartheid restrictions in 1955. Their protests eventually failed, however. In the early 1960s, pass-law restrictions were extended to women and new legislation restricted black women without steady employment to stays of no more than seventy-two hours in any urban area. Also in 1964, many senior ANC leaders were arrested, and others fled from South Africa or went underground, and the ANCWL became almost defunct. Women continued to join the urban work force, and by the late 1980s, women made up at least 90 percent of the domestic work force and 36 percent of the industrial work force, according to labor union estimates. However, as with the rest of the world, women's wages were lower than men's even for the same job, positions normally held by women had long hours and few benefits,e.g. sick leave; women often were dismissed without advance notice and without any type of termination pay. Conservative Afrikaner women have organized in support of Afrikaner cultural preservation and apartheid since the 1970s. The Kappiekommando was established in the late 1970s to demand a return to traditional Afrikaner values. This organization was named for its distinctive Voortrekker dress, which caused some young Afrikaners and others to ridicule its members' appearance and their militancy. The Kappiekommando's militant opposition to political reforms eventually contributed to its marginalization, even among staunchly conservative Afrikaners. The Afrikanervroue-Kenkrag (AVK), another Afrikaner women's organization, was formed in 1983 and worked primarily to oppose racial integration in schools and other public places. AVK membership grew to about 1,000 during the mid-1980s. The group published a monthly newsletter and cooperated with other Afrikaner organizations, but like the Kappiekommando, the AVK lost support when mainstream Afrikaner political leaders began working toward racial inclusiveness in the 1990s. Women in the 1990s and 2000s The ANCWL was resurrected in 1990, after the ban on the ANC was lifted, and women in more than 500 towns and cities organized to press for consideration of gender issues in the upcoming constitutional negotiations. At the insistence of its Women's League, the ANC accepted, in principle, the proposal that women should receive one-third of the political appointments in the new government. Other symbolic gains by the ANCWL have included strong policy stands on women's rights and protection against abuse and exploitation, but translating these standards into enforceable laws proved to be a difficult task. Women are achieving new prominence in politics as a result of the sweeping political reforms of the 1990s. In 1994 women won election to eighty of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, the only directly elected house of parliament, and a woman, Frene Ginwala, was elected Speaker of the National Assembly. Women also were elected to almost one-third of the seats in the nine provincial assemblies. Nelson Mandela as president appointed two women cabinet ministers in May 1994, and a woman succeeded the late minister of housing, Joe Slovo, after his death in January 1995. Three women were deputy ministers in early 1995. One of these, President Mandela's former wife, Winnie Mandela, was appointed deputy minister of arts, culture, science, and technology. Eliminating violence against women and improving educational opportunities for women are almost universally supported goals in South Africa in the mid-1990s, but these goals receive only rhetorical support, in many cases. More urgent priorities are to eliminate the vestiges of apartheid legislation and to improve economic and social conditions for the very poor, for children, and for other groups that were especially disadvantaged in recent decades. Gender- related inequalities appeared likely to be decried, but relegated to secondary importance, well into the 21st century. Marriage and family life Until the late 20th century, married women's rights remained restricted by law. The family law has changed gradually throughout the 20th century, with white women being the first to gain rights, and black women in customary marriages being the last. Marriage law has, for most of the 20th century, been based on the Roman-Dutch law concept of marital power of the husband, a doctrine in terms of which a wife was legally an incapax under the usufructory tutorship (tutela usufructuaria) of her husband. The marital power included the power of the husband to administer both his wife's separate property and their community property. A wife was not able to leave a will, enter into a contract, or sue or be sued, in her own name or without the permission of her husband. The report of the Women's Legal Disabilities Commission in 1949 led to the enacting of the Matrimonial Affairs Act in 1953, which improved the legal status of wives by restricting the marital power, but it did not abolish it. The Matrimonial Property Act of 1984 abolished it prospectively (i.e. for marriages contracted after the act came into force) but not for marriages between black people. An amendment in 1988 abolished it prospectively for marriages of black people under the civil law, but not for marriages contracted under customary law. A further amendment in 1993 repealed the marital power for all civil marriages, whenever they were contracted. The marital power persisted, however, in the Transkei (which was nominally independent from 1976 to 1994) but it was held to be unconstitutional for civil marriages by the High Court in 1999. In 2000, when it came into force, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, 1998 abolished the marital power for all marriages under customary law throughout South Africa. Other important changes enacted by 20th century legislation include abolishing the concept of restitution of conjugal rights by the Divorce Act, 1979 (Act No. 70 of 1979), Section 14, as well as enacting several specific laws against domestic violence in the 1990s (see Domestic violence in South Africa). South Africa outlawed marital rape in 1993. The 21st century has seen different conceptions about marriage: in 2006, South Africa became the fifth country in the world to allow same-sex marriage. In South Africa, the practice of marriage by abduction, is known under the name of ukuthwala, and is the custom of abducting young girls and forcing them into marriage, often with the consent of their parents.http://www.lrc.org.za/other-news/2186-2012-08-02-traditional- practices-may-be-harmful-xingwana This practice occurs mainly in rural areas, in particular the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The girls who are victims of this practice are frequently underage. Status of women and girls School girls in Cape Town In 2015, the UN General Assembly (UNGA), SABC and ONE launched the Strong Girl Campaign with the aim of engaging South Africans on the importance of South African government putting women and girls at the center of their UNGA commitments where new development goals would be agreed on. The UNGA discussed the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which would direct world development efforts for the next 15 years. The South African government has produced a number of policies and legislation in pursuit of women’s empowerment. For instance, the Constitution includes Section 9 which promotes equality for all persons and freedom from discrimination and the Employment Equity Act, No 55 (1998) which strives to achieve equality in the workplace by promoting fair treatment in employment. The status of women in South Africa remains to be complicated so far but thanks to the UN and the South African government, some improvements have been made though despite the improvements, there is still so much more which still need for more investments in programs to empower women and girls so as to improve their status and opportunities. Sexual violence The Sonke Gender Justice programme in South Africa aims to transform societal attitudes towards sexual violence The rate of sexual violence in South Africa is among the highest in the world. In 1993 South Africa outlawed marital rape. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 is a comprehensive legal act, which prohibits and punishes sexual violence. Despite the strong legal framework, sexual violence is very common in South Africa; in one study one in four men admitted to having committed rape. It is estimated that there are about 600,000 rape victims per year in the country. Most cases are not reported to authorities. In South Africa, the virgin cleansing myth is still prevalent, leading to high rates of child sexual abuse. During 2015/16, there were 51,895 crimes of a sexual nature reported to the South African Police Service. In September 2019, on the third day of protests, Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, disclosed the violence against women in his country as national crisis. In 2018 alone, the number of women murdered in South Africa reached 3.000. Reproductive health and rights Estimated HIV prevalence among adults aged 15-49 by country in 2007 Social constructions and expectations play an important role in the South African women’s sexual activity, sexual health and her vulnerability to STI exposure. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are of major public health concern, especially in developing countries where the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are high. HIV/AIDS in South Africa is a very serious problem. The country has the fourth global rate of infection: in 2016, 18.90% of adults 15–49 years old were living with HIV/AIDS. Only Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana have a higher rate. Women are much more likely to be infected. Among women, it has been found that it is older South African women who are married or cohabiting with a partner who are of the highest risk group for HIV exposure. A study has concluded that this is a result of an inequitable power of balance between men and women which leaves women, who have less power in the relationship, unable to request nor negotiate condom use with their partners. In an article from the World Health Organization experts looked at data to present estimates of the prevalence, on any given day, of STIs among women in rural South Africa and the proportion who are asymptomatic, symptomatic but not seeking care, and symptomatic and seeking care. The study found that the majority of women with STIs in South Africa remained untreated because either women were did not present obvious symptoms or, even when they did, the symptoms were not recognized nor acted upon. The study concluded that improved case management alone is \\"therefore unlikely to have a major public health impact. Improving partner treatment and women's awareness of symptoms is essential, while the potential of mass STI treatment needs to be explored\\". Data has shown a correlation between the increase in sex education and the decrease of new cases of HIV infections among young women in South Africa, with education on safe sex practices having substantially helped to curb the spread of STI's in general. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health concluded that safe sex education prior to young people’s engagement in sexual activity – their “sexual debut” – was a major indicator of whether young people engaged in condom use. Women’s vaginal practices, which include the cleansing, treatment of infections, pampering, and use of beauty products, affects their sexual and reproductive health and susceptibility to STI. A large percentage of women in South Africa engage in intra-vaginal product use, i.e. douching, which increases their chances for HIV infection. Maternal mortality is one of the lowest in Africa, although still high by global standards.However, in South Africa, there are conflicting reports on the prevalence of maternal and neonatal mortality, derived from both direct and indirect estimation techniques. South Africa's Constitution recognizes and protects the rights of all citizens to have access to safe, effective, appropriate and affordable reproductive education , contraception and health services. However, there are contradictory laws in place in regards to women’s ability to engage in sexual practices and receive sexual healthcare services. For example, the age of consent in South Africa for women is 16, with the law requiring mandatory reporting of youths engaged in underage sex. However, girls may legally request birth control from medical centers at age 12. Due to the contradictory and confusing nature of such legislation the sexual health services and education given to young women in South Africa is limited by the health care practitioners understanding of the laws and their individual judgments of how to proceed. Contraceptive use amount young South Africans aged 15 to 24 is low and consequently the rate of unwanted pregnancies reported among young women are high. A study of contraceptive use and pregnancy among South African women found that 65% of pregnancies in this age group were premarital and unplanned. And a 1988 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey found that 35% of all teenagers had either been pregnant or had given birth by the age of 19. Types of contraceptives used by South African women are racially stratified with South African women of color predominantly utilizing contraceptive injections. South Africa is also one of the few countries in Africa to have a liberal abortion law: under the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1996, abortion is allowed on request during the first trimester of pregnancy, and in special circumstances at later stages. However, this does not mean that it is easy to get an abortion in South Africa, as not all health care facilities are equally nor adequately equipped to meet the demands for abortion services. As of January 2013 it has been said that it is often cheaper and quicker to get an illegal abortion than to navigate official channels to get a legal abortion. Social stigmas surrounding abortion, contraception use, and sexual activity among young women and teens are still strong and limit young South African women's ability to access and utilize reproductive health services that are guaranteed to them by their government. This issue is compounded by the fact that while women have the right to free abortions the government only covers the cost of the abortion procedures, but not the cost of maintaining a dedicated staff or facilities out of which abortions can be performed.

Family and early life Much of the details of his early life are obscure, but it is known that he was born into a family from Little Burstead, Essex, England. He entered the navy and was commissioned lieutenant on 22 February 1690. His first assignment was to HMS Anne, under Captain John Tyrell. Walton was present aboard the Anne at the allied defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head in May 1690, when the Anne was dismasted. Despite rigging up a jury jig, the Anne was unable to escape and was deliberately run ashore west of Rye where her crew abandoned and then burnt her to prevent her capture. Tyrell then received command of HMS Ossory, taking Walton with him, and the two saw action in the Battle of Barfleur in 1692. Promotion Walton was appointed first lieutenant of HMS Devonshire in 1693 under Captain Henry Haughton. He spent most of this period serving in the English Channel until 1696, when he joined the main fleet aboard HMS Restoration under Captain Thomas Fowlis. Acquitting himself well, Walton was promoted to captain on 19 January 1697 and was given command of the 24-gun HMS Seaford. He was not in command long when on 5 May 1697, the Seaford was captured and burnt by the French off the Isles of Scilly. Walton returned to England and was given command of HMS Seahorse. He commanded her until 1699, in the North Sea and off the Dutch coast, followed by a period in the Mediterranean in 1699 under Vice- Admiral Matthew Aylmer. In the West Indies with Benbow Walton was then appointed to command HMS Carcass for a ten-month period between 1701 and 1702, and sailed her to the West Indies. Here he joined a squadron under Vice- Admiral John Benbow, and in March 1702 Walton was appointed to command the 48-gun HMS Ruby. He then participated in the Action of August 1702 under Benbow and against Admiral Jean du Casse. During the action, most of the captains hung back from the engagement, and only Walton's conduct was considered above reproach.Walton at the National Maritime Museum Walton kept the Ruby closely engaged, supporting Benbow aboard HMS Breda until the Ruby was disabled by French fire. Ruby being unable to contribute further, Benbow ordered Walton to return to Port Royal, Jamaica. Walton's next command was HMS Canterbury in June 1703, under the command of Vice-Admiral John Graydon. Walton returned to England in October 1704, eventually spending six years and nine months aboard the Canterbury. He spent between 1705 and 1706 in the Mediterranean. He accompanied Sir Thomas Hardy in the escorting a convoy to Lisbon in 1707, and after gave evidence in favour of Hardy at the court- martial. Hardy had been criticised for not pursuing a French squadron that had been sighted during the voyage. Walton's next command was HMS Montagu in September 1710. He sailed with the fleet under Sir Hovenden Walker to attack Quebec City. During the voyage Walton and the Montagu captured two prizes. After the failure of the expedition, Walton returned to England and was appointed to act as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth in December 1712. Victory at Cape Passaro He returned to sea again when he was appointed to command HMS Defiance in early January 1718, followed by a return to his old ship, Canterbury. In the Canterbury he joined the fleet under George Byng and sailed for the Mediterranean. He had a large part in the Battle of Cape Passaro on 31 July 1718 and was given command of a detached five-ship squadron and sent to pursue a division of the Spanish fleet. Walton achieved a substantial victory with his small command, capturing six ships and destroying six more in the Strait of Messina. Modest in victory, he wrote to Byng on 5 August to inform him of his success, a letter described by The Gentleman's Magazine as ‘remarkable for naval Eloquence’. It read > ‘Sir, we have taken and destroyed all the Spanish ships which were upon the > coast: the number as per margin’GM, 606 This resulted in Thomas Corbett pronouncing him fitter to achieve a ‘gallant action’ than to describe one. Knighthood and further promotions Walton returned to England and in 1720 was appointed to HMS Nassau, then a guard ship at Sheerness. He was knighted on 15 January 1721 for his victory in 1718 and was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue on 16 February 1723. He was appointed second in command of the Baltic fleet under Sir Charles Wager on 1726, and hoisted his flag in HMS Cumberland. He then served with Wager off Cadiz and Gibraltar in late 1726, returning to the Baltic aboard HMS Captain in April 1727 under the command of Admiral Sir John Norris. Walton was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Red in December 1727, Vice-Admiral of the Blue in January 1727 (Old Style, 1728 New Style)), Vice-Admiral of the White in 1728 and was back with Wager in the Channel, followed by the Mediterranean in 1729, this time aboard HMS Princess Amelia. He continued his rise through the ranks, being appointed commander-in-chief at Spithead in 1731, and vice-admiral of the red in January 1732. Admiral of the blue came next on 26 February 1734, and he spent 1734 to 1735 as commander-in-chief at the Nore, with HMS Revenge and then HMS Newark as his flagships. Retirement and final years George Walton retired in 1736, receiving a pension of £600 a year. He died three years later on 21 November 1739 aged 74 and unmarried. He was buried in the family's traditional resting place in the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Little Burstead, Essex. He left £9,600 in his will to be divided amongst his relations.

It was first performed in March 1884 at one of Mily Balakirev's Free Music School concerts in St. Petersburg. Form The concerto is written in one continuous movement with three contrasting sections: #Moderato—Allegretto quasi polacca #Andante mosso #Allegro The score can be critically examined through the International Music Score Library Project . Overview After a long hiatus, Mily Balakirev reappeared on the Russian music scene in 1881, at the first Free Music School concert of the 1881-82 season.Rimsky-Korsakov, Nikolai, My Musical Life, 256. It was Balakirev who suggested that Rimsky-Korsakov write a piano concerto. Rimsky- Korsakov was not a pianist. Nevertheless, as Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, \\"It must be said that it sounded beautiful and proved entirely satisfactory in the sense of piano technique and style; this greatly astonished Balakirev, who found my concerto to his liking. He had by no means expected that I ... should know how to compose anything entirely pianistic.\\"Rimsky-Korsakov, 263. Rimsky- Korsakov acknowledged his indebtedness to Franz Liszt in writing this work,Rimsky-Korsakov, 263. dedicating it to him. Like Liszt's concertos, particularly the second, it is in one movement, with sections that contrast yet flow into one another without strict boundaries. It is also Lisztian in its virtuosic decorative pianism.Garden, Edward, Liner notes for Hyperion CDA66640, Balakirev & Rimsky-Korsakov Piano Concertos (London: Hyperion Records Inc., 1993), 2. Unlike the Liszt concertos, the Rimsky-Korsakov concerto is monothematic. Rimsky-Korsakov took this theme from No. 18 of Balakirev's collection of folk songs, published in 1866. He puts this song through thematic metamorphosis, again in a Lisztian manner, changing its character and style as the piece progresses. Another potential influence was the Fantasie russe in B minor for piano and orchestra by Eduard Nápravník. Rimsky-Korsakov had conducted this piece in Moscow during the All-Russian Exposition of 1882.Rimsky-Korsakov, 260. Like the Rimsky-Korsakov concerto, the Fantasie is written in a free form, but uses three Russian folk songs instead of just one (including \\"Song of the Volga Boatmen\\").Soifertis, Evgeny, Liner notes for Hyperion CDA67511, Nápravník: Concerto Symphonique, Fantasie Russe; Blumenfeld: Allegro (London: Hyperion Records Limited, 2005) 5).  Influence and neglect  The concerto's lyricism, bravura passages and inventive use of folk song placed it firmly in the Russian nationalist camp. It influenced several other Russian composers, including Glazunov, Arensky and, especially in his First Piano Concerto, Rachmaninoff. The work is seldom heard in the West, however, due largely to its brevity (an average performance lasts approximately 15 minutes).

The classical definition of acceleration entails following a single particle/point along the rigid body and observing its changes of velocity. In this article the notion of spatial acceleration is explored, which entails looking at a fixed (unmoving) point in space and observing the changes of velocity of whatever particle/point happens to coincide with the observation point. This is similar to the acceleration definition fluid dynamics where typically one can measure velocity and/or accelerations on a fixed locate inside a testing apparatus.  Definition  Consider a moving rigid body and the velocity of a particle/point P along the body being a function of the position and velocity of a center particle/point C and the angular velocity \\\\vec \\\\omega. The linear velocity vector \\\\vec v_P at P is expressed in terms of the velocity vector \\\\vec v_C at C as: \\\\vec v_P = \\\\vec v_C + \\\\vec \\\\omega \\\\times (\\\\vec r_P-\\\\vec r_C) where \\\\vec \\\\omega is the angular velocity vector.

It was approved by the Parliament of Georgia on 24 August 1995 and entered into force on 17 October 1995. The Constitution replaced the Decree on State Power of November 1992 which had functioned as an interim basic law following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Early constitutional history Fragments of the Constitution of 1921 On 21 February 1921, facing the onset of Soviet aggression, the Constituent Assembly of Georgia adopted a constitution of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, the first modern fundamental law in the nation's history. Under Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the first democratically elected president of the newly independent Georgia, the nation continued to function under the 1978 constitution of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was based on the 1977 constitution of the Soviet Union. The first post-communist parliament amended that document extensively. In February 1992, the Georgian National Congress (the alternate parliament elected in 1990) formally designated the Georgian constitution of 1921 as the effective constitution of Georgia. That declaration received legitimacy from the signatures of Jaba Ioseliani and Tengiz Kitovani, at that time two of the three members of the governing Military Council. In February 1993, Eduard Shevardnadze called for extensive revisions of the 1921 constitution. Characterizing large sections of that document as wholly unacceptable, Shevardnadze proposed forming a constitutional commission to draft a new version by December 1993.  2004 Amendments  On 4 January, Mikhail Saakashvili won the Georgian presidential election, 2004 with an overwhelming majority of 96 percent of the votes cast. Constitutional amendments were rushed through Parliament in February strengthening the powers of the president to dismiss parliament and creating the post of prime minister. Zurab Zhvania was appointed prime minister and Nino Burjanadze, the interim president, became speaker of parliament.  2010 Amendments  On 15 October 2010, the Parliament of Georgia adopted with 112 votes to five major amendments to the constitution, which significantly reduced powers of the president of Georgia in favor of the prime minister and the government. The new constitution went into force upon the 17 November 2013 inauguration of Giorgi Margvelashvili, the winner of the 2013 presidential election.New Constitution Adopted. Civil Georgia. 15 October 2010  2017–2018 Amendments  On 26 September 2017, the Parliament of Georgia adopted the much-debated constitutional amendments with 117 voting in favor and two against. The vote was boycotted by the opposition. According to the new legislation, direct presidential elections are to be abolished and the country will transfer to fully proportional parliamentary representation in 2024. On October 9, President Giorgi Margvelashvili vetoed the amendments and returned the draft bill to the Parliament with his objections, but the Parliament overrode the veto and approved the initial version on 13 October. Further amendments, incorporating several Venice Commission-recommended changes, were adopted on 21 March 2018. The following amendments where in the constitution. * Define marriage as \\"a union between a woman and a man for the purpose of creating a family.” * Agricultural land is a ‘resource of exceptional significance’ and can be owned only by ‘the state, a self-governing entity, a citizen of Georgia, or a union of Georgian citizens’.

Tufts Medical Center is based in Boston, MA but also has satellite locations in areas including Quincy, Chelmsford, Framingham, and others. The hospital also has partnerships with Lawrence General Hospital and Lowell General Hospital and MelroseWakefield HospitalMelroseWakefield Healthcare History Tufts Medical Center's origins date back to 1796 when the Boston Dispensary was established as the first permanent medical facility in New England, and one of the first in the United States. Early donors included Paul Revere.Revolutionary Care Then and Now: A History of Tufts-New England Medical Center Founded in 1796 In 1894, the Boston Floating Hospital was established by a Congregational minister, the Rev. Rufus Tobey. At the time, many believed in the cleansing and therapeutic qualities of sea air to improve health, and Tobey had heard of a hospital ship for children in New York. For the next 33 years, two successive ships were home to the hospital for children in Boston Harbor. In 1931, after the second Floating Hospital for Children ship was destroyed in a fire, the hospital was relocated to a permanent building onshore. New England Medical Center was established in 1930 as a union of the Boston Dispensary, the Boston Floating Hospital for Children, and the Trustees of Tufts College. The Pratt Diagnostic Clinic was added in 1946, and in 1950 when Tufts University School of Medicine and Tufts University School of Dental Medicine relocated to Chinatown the name was expanded to New England Medical Center Hospital.Concise Encyclopedia of Tufts History. Ed. Anne Sauer In 1968 it was renamed Tufts-New England Medical Center (Tufts-NEMC) to reflect the growing relationship between the hospital and the university. In 1970, the NEMC board met with the Tufts Trustees to outline a cooperative agreement which remained in effect until the late 1970s when tensions between the organizations resulted in \\"Tufts\\" being dropped from the name. After a tense period of competition between the organizations during the 1980s, the NEMC board reached an agreement with the Tufts Trustees in 1991 and the name was changed back to Tufts-New England Medical Center. The affiliation agreement they adopted still stands. The children's hospital still reflects its legacy in its name: Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center.h The name was shortened to Tufts Medical Center on March 4, 2008.

Tufts Medical Center is a partner with Tufts University in the Clinical and Translational Research Institute, funded by a Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Institutes of Health. =Strike= On July 12, 2017, approximately 1,200 nurses, who were members of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, went on a one-day strike to protest staffing levels, wages, and retirement benefits. The action became a lockout when some of the striking nurses were told they could not return to work for a period of four days. Research Tufts MC has a history of achievement in scientific research and clinical advances. Tufts research led to the discovery of drugs that prevent the body's rejection of transplanted organs, coining the term \\"immunosuppression,\\" and also brought to light the link between obesity and heart disease. Tufts ranks among the top 5 percent of the nation's institutions that receive federal research funds. Innovations Tufts Medical Center and its predecessor institutions are responsible for numerous medical innovations, including: * In 1899, the Boston Dispensary established the first U.S. lung clinic. * In 1918, the Boston Dispensary established a food clinic which was the first of its kind; it is now the Frances Stern Nutrition Center. * Around 1919, Dr. Alfred Bosworth invented a synthetic milk product for infants, known and sold today as Similac brand of infant formula. * In 1927, Dr. William Hinton perfected the diagnostic test for syphilis, which is still used today. * In 1952, the first preparation of human growth hormone was developed. * In 1958, the suppression of the body's immune system to avoid the rejection of transplanted tissue was demonstrated and the term \\"Immunosuppression\\" was coined. * In 1963, the Family Participation Unit was established, allowing parents to stay in the hospital overnight with their children. * In 1981, the world's first pediatric trauma center was established. * In 1997, the Neely House was established as a first-of-its-kind bed and breakfast-style home within the walls of the hospital. The facility hosts the families of adult and pediatric cancer patients.The Neely House, funded by the Cam Neely Foundation for Cancer Care * In 2001, the first-in- the-nation transplant exchange program, \\"Hope Through Sharing\\" was established. * Ranked #6 among top Boston hospitals and #8 in Massachusetts in 2014 by US News Numbers Tufts Medical Center has a total of 415 licensed beds: 206 medical/surgical beds, 48 adult intensive care beds, 57 pediatric beds, 50 pediatric and neonatal intensive care beds, 34 post-partum beds, 20 adult psychiatric beds, and 24 infant bassinets. =Revenue= In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, the hospital had $974.5 million in revenue, with an operating loss of $2.6 million. Emergency medicine The Emergency Department (ED) is equipped for the evaluation, resuscitation and stabilization of patients of all ages who present with acute illness or injury. The Floating Hospital for Children is the home of the Kiwanis Pediatric Trauma Institute and is a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center (the oldest pediatric trauma center in the country).American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma The hospital is now an adult trauma center as well, verified by the American College of Surgeons as a Level I trauma center in 2012, one of 5 Boston adult trauma centers. Tufts Medical Center is part of the consortium of hospitals which operates Boston MedFlight, and is equipped with a rooftop helipad.

To support this requests, the Pope asks for a holy prayer crusade to the Most Blessed Virgin. He asks for a consecration to be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families. Although a terrible war has ended, peace has not arrived in the minds and hearts of all men. The post-war period is full of dangers for the family of nations, dangers of threatening disasters. Because human means are unequal to the task, the Pontiff appeals in prayer first of all to God; he exhorts all throughout the world, to implore, together, in ardent prayer the Divine assistance.Auspicia quaedam, 5 He thanks the Virgin Mother of God for having obtained, through her powerful intercession, the long desired termination of World War Two. At the same time, He implores her for the gift of peace, of fraternal and complete peace among all nations and for harmony among all social classes.Auspicia quaedam, 7,8 The encyclical argues, that prayer to the Blessed Virgin must be more than words, they must be based on virtues, reform and a revival of Christian conduct. For only from Christian virtues one can hope to see the course of history take its proper, orderly direction. The Pontiff is concerned about the Holy Places of Palestine, which have long been disturbed.Auspicia quaedam, 12 * If there exists any place that ought to be most dear to every cultured person, surely it is Palestine, where, from the dawn of antiquity, such great light of truth shone for all men, where the Word of God made flesh announced, through the angels' choir, peace to all men; where, finally, Christ hanging on the Cross acquired salvation for all mankind, with arms outstretched as if He were inviting all nations to fraternal harmony; and where He consecrated His precept of charity with the shedding of His blood.Auspicia quaedam, 13 =Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary = He desires, that supplications be poured forth to the Most Holy Virgin for this request: that the situation in Palestine may at long last be settled justly and thereby concord and peace be also happily established.

In the gut, the ingested protein is split into an insoluble peptide (para kappa-casein) and a soluble hydrophilic glycopeptide (caseinomacropeptide). Caseinomacropeptide is responsible for increased efficiency of digestion, prevention of neonate hypersensitivity to ingested proteins, and inhibition of gastric pathogens.  Structure  Molecular surface model of K-Casein Caseins are a family of phosphoproteins (αS1, αS2, β, κ) that account for nearly 80% of bovine milk proteins and that form soluble aggregates are known as \\"casein micelles\\" in which κ-casein molecules stabilize the structure. There are several models that account for the special conformation of casein in the micelles. One of them proposes that the micellar nucleus is formed by several submicelles, the periphery consisting of microvellosities of κ-casein Another model suggests that the nucleus is formed by casein-interlinked fibrils. Finally, the most recent model proposes a double link among the caseins for gelling to take place. All 3 models consider micelles as colloidal particles formed by casein aggregates wrapped up in soluble κ-casein molecules. Milk-clotting proteases act on the soluble portion, κ-casein, thus originating an unstable micellar state that results in clot formation.  Milk clotting  In red/blue Phe105-Met106 bond of κ- casein Chymosin (EC 3.4.23.4) is an aspartic protease that specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond in Phe105-Met106 of κ- casein and is considered to be the most efficient protease for the cheesemaking industry. However, there are milk-clotting proteases able to cleave other peptide bonds in the κ-casein chain, such as the endothiapepsin produced by Endothia parasitica. There are also several milk-clotting proteases that, being able to cleave the Phe105-Met106 bond in the κ-casein molecule, also cleave other peptide bonds in other caseins, such as those produced by Cynara cardunculus or even bovine chymosin. This allows the manufacture of different cheeses with a variety of rheological and organoleptic properties. The milk-clotting process consists of three main phases: # Enzymatic degradation of κ-casein. # Micellar flocculation. # Gel formation. Each step follows a different kinetic pattern, the limiting step in milk-clotting being the degradation rate of κ-casein. The kinetic pattern of the second step of the milk-clotting process is influenced by the cooperative nature of micellar flocculation, whereas the rheological properties of the gel formed depend on the type of action of the proteases, the type of milk, and the patterns of casein proteolysis. The overall process is influenced by several different factors, such as pH or temperature. The conventional way of quantifying a given milk-clotting enzyme employs milk as the substrate and determines the time elapsed before the appearance of milk clots. However, milk clotting may take place without the participation of enzymes because of variations in physicochemical factors, such as low pH or high temperature. Consequently, this may lead to confusing and irreproducible results, particularly when the enzymes have low activity. At the same time, the classical method is not specific enough, in terms of setting the precise onset of milk gelation, such that the determination of the enzymatic units involved becomes difficult and unclear. Furthermore, although it has been reported that κ-casein hydrolysis follows typical Michaelis–Menten kinetics, it is difficult to determine with the classic milk-clotting assay. To overcome this, several alternative methods have been proposed, such as the determination of halo diameter in agar-gelified milk, colorimetric measurement, or determination of the rate of degradation of casein previously labeled with either a radioactive tracer or a fluorochrome compound. All these methods use casein as the substrate to quantify proteolytic or milk-clotting activities. FTC-Κ-casein assay Fluorescein isothiocyanate Κ-casein labeled with the fluorochrome fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to yield the fluorescein thiocarbamoyl (FTC) derivative. This substrate is used to determinate the milk clotting activity of proteases. FTC-κ-casein method affords accurate and precise determinations of κ-caseinolytic degradation, the first step in the milk-clotting process. This method is the result of a modification to the one described by S.S. Twining (1984). The main modification was substituting the substrate previously used (casein) by -casein labeled with the fluorochrome fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to yield the fluorescein thiocarbamoyl (FTC) derivative. This variation allows quantification of the -casein molecules degraded in a more precise and specific way, detecting only those enzymes able to degrade such molecules. The method described by Twining (1984), however, was designed to detect the proteolytic activity of a considerably large variety of enzymes. FTC-κ-casein allows the detection of different types of proteases at levels when no milk clotting is yet apparent, unveiling its higher sensitivity over currently used assay procedures. Therefore, the method may find application as an indicator during the purification or characterization of new milk-clotting enzymes.

It came together during 1889-1890, conducting its first track and field meet in the spring of 1889, its first football championship in the fall of 1889, and its first baseball championship in the spring of 1890. The formal date for the establishment of the Cook County High School Athletic League, which served Chicago and its suburbs, is 1898. Its creation, however, was really a matter of consolidation and rationalization of a conference that had already been in place for a decade. But even before the emergence of the Cook County League during 1889 and 1890, interscholastic competition of a sandlot variety had gone on for nearly a decade. During the years of this sandlot phase Chicago schoolboys were inventing interscholastic sports, undoubtedly patterning their approach after what they saw in the universities at the time. The first two sports that Chicago area schools adopted for competition were—not surprisingly--football and baseball. No conclusive evidence has surfaced as to what year either sport was adopted, but it was probably sometime around 1881, at least for some of the suburban schools. Football One should not imagine that the competition was anywhere near as organized as it is today. Instead, boys in each of the schools formed a club with an \\"eleven\\"—to use the vernacular of the day. The clubs then issued challenges to other schools to participate in games. There were no teachers, no coaches, no uniforms, no laid-out fields, and no schedules. There were various league set up during the 1880s, but they were of the sandlot variety and more often than not they never lasted through the season. A true football league was finally established in the fall of 1889, when the \\"Cook County High School Football League\\" was formed and a schedule of games adopted. Participating schools in the league were West Division, Hyde Park, Manual Training, Lake View, and Englewood. No longer were football games just a matter of a bunch of kids getting together for games. Hyde Park won the first Cook County championship, beating out neighboring Englewood, beginning one of the most legendary and intense rivalries in the history of Illinois high school football. The two schools dominated competition in football and other sports in the league. In the fall of 1890, South Division and Evanston joined the league and football was thoroughly established among Cook County high schools. A true measure how well the game progressed in Chicago can be found by leaping ahead a few years to take a look at a couple intersectional competitions in which Cook County schools participated, in what were then pretentiously billed as \\"national championships.\\" In the fall of 1902 Hyde Park, featuring the great Walter Eckersall at quarterback, slaughtered Brooklyn Polytechnic 105 to 0 at University of Chicago's Marshall Field. The Hyde Park coach was then hired by Polytechnic to coach their team for the following season. The following year North Division met Brooklyn Boys' High in New York and beat them 75 to 0, which was not as close as the score indicated according to the New York Times report. Baseball The story of the development of baseball among Cook County schools was similar to that of football. There were several baseball leagues that were formed in the 1880s, but none of them lasted. In May and June 1889, however, there was a plethora of games reported in the Chicago Tribune, involving North Division, West Division, Manual Training, Hyde Park, and Northwest Division teams, but no league was evident. There is firm evidence of an organized league in 1890. Evanston, Englewood, Hyde Park, South Division, West Division, Manual Training, and Harvard met on February 7 and formed a conference. The person credited as being most instrumental in launching of the baseball league was Christian Miller, principal and baseball coach at Evanston High. He was an early advocate of athletic competition for schoolboys, and during the 1880s wrote such advocacy pieces for the education journals of the day. Evanston was the league champion and dominated the first several years of competition. Track and field Track and field was the third sport to garner interscholastic interest, with the earliest references dating back to December 1886. The first activities were intramural field days conducted by such schools as Evanston, Hyde Park, and North Division. These activities by the various schools built up to an interscholastic field day on June 8, 1889, for all the Cook County schools. No team champion was determined, but the following year a team championship was recognized, Lake View. Clearly track and field established itself during 1889 to 1891 as an organized sport in which participating schools thought themselves members of a Cook County conference, paralleling similar developments in football and baseball. During the 1890s, Lake View, Hyde Park, and Englewood dominated competition. Indoor Baseball Indoor baseball to the uninitiated was the predecessor sport of softball and popular in Chicago during the 1890s and during the first decade after the turn of the century. A 17-inch ball and a narrow bat was used so as to facilitate play inside armories and similarly large indoor facilities. (Later, when the game was moved outdoors, the ball's circumference was reduced to 16 inches.) The game had been invented by George Hancock in 1887 at the Farragut Boat Club on Chicago's South Side. By 1892 there were flourishing amateur leagues involving more than 100 teams in the city. Indoor baseball was a late development in the Cook County League. West Division had a team as early as 1892, but it was not until December, 1895, that representatives of ten schools formed a league. Only five schools actually participated the first year—Austin, Lake View, Evanston, Oak Park, and English—because of the difficulty of the schools in obtaining playing facilities. The first year Austin won the banner. The sport was conducted annually until the demise of the league in 1913, and lingered on for two to three years afterwards. One peculiarity of competition was how the high schools on the West Side—West Division (McKinley), English (Crane), Medill, and Austin—dominated the league. In the years 1907 to 1913, Crane High—with brothers Walter and Frank Halas and later brother George Halas (of professional football fame)--was in every title game and took the championship five of those seven years. Even the West Side girls got involved, because as early as 1895 West Division had a girls team and in 1899 was joined by another West Side school, Medill. The two schools competed against each other for a half decade or so. Tennis Tennis never generated a lot of enthusiasm in Cook County schools, but it was a recognized sport early on. As early as 1884 Lake View High had a tennis club, and 1888 tennis was part of some of the high school intramural field days along with track and field events. On June 18, the Tribune reported on the \\"first annual tournament of the Cook County High School Lawn Tennis Association,\\" held in Oak Park. Participating were Lake View, Englewood, English, Evanston, North Division, and Oak Park. The championship, both singles and doubles, was won by Oak Park. The next year there was no follow-up Cook County tourney. Instead a \\"Western Interscholastic Tennis Games\\" was held involving \\"high and preparatory schools\\" at the University of Chicago. Clearly, by 1894 tennis had been established as a regular sport among the Cook County schools, even though an annual tournament specifically for these schools was not being held. It was not until 1909 that the Cook County League again held a league-sponsored championship tourney. Tennis was a privileged sport and the pattern in most of the country showed greater development in the private schools than in the public schools. Basketball In the Chicago area basketball did not take hold among the Cook County schools until 1895, and then curiously only as a girls sport. In the fall of 1895, Austin (and reportedly Englewood as well) started up teams and played against squads from University of Chicago, Lake Forest College, and Hull House. In the fall of 1896, Oak Park organized a team and the first interscholastic girls' game in Illinois, and perhaps the first in the nation, was played on December 18 between Oak Park and Austin. The extra year's experience of Austin was telling as Oak Park was beaten 16 to 4. Englewood and Evanston also joined in interscholastic competition that year. The 1898 constitution recognized girls' basketball as one of the league's sports, but it was not until February, 1900, that league competition leading to a championship was established. The teams competing in the league the first year were Austin, Englewood, Hyde Park, and West Division. Oak Park had a team but chose not to join that first year. Englewood beat Austin for the title in 1900. The earliest schoolboy basketball in Illinois was played by an affiliated school of the University of Chicago, Morgan Park Academy, which was competing against its parent school and YMCAs during 1893 and 1894. Its enthusiasm for the game did not last, however, because in 1896 when the Morgan Park Academy helped form the Academic League the only sports played were football, baseball, tennis, and track and field. The earliest basketball played by a public high school was in 1896, when North Division competed against YMCAs and other athletic clubs. Meanwhile, championship competition continued for the girls through the 1905-06 season, but the Victorian attitudes of educators put an end to it. Chicago superintendent of schools Edwin G. Cooley, who was making it his crusade to bring interscholastics under control, began putting pressure on the principals to stop the formation of the league in January, 1906. The girls managed to persevere with a league that season, probably with the support of sympathetic principals, but the following year Cooley prevailed and the league contests were ended, and schoolgirl basketball in the city went into rapid decline. A few schools, notably Hyde Park and North Division, continued to field teams to at least 1910. Meanwhile, boys' competition grew dramatically after it finally took hold in 1900. The first interscholastic game on record in Illinois was that between Englewood and Elgin on March 2, 1900, and the very next year the game had mushroomed so much that a league of eight schools was formed—Englewood, English High, Evanston, Hyde Park, Marshall, Medill, North Division, and West Division. The number of schools steadily increased each year and the competition intensified until the demise of the league. End Years Other sports added by the league in subsequent years were cross country in 1908, soccer in the fall of 1910, and golf in 1911. In each case, however, competition in each sport preceded by several years the formal adoption by the league. Swimming competition under the sponsorship of private athletic clubs and YMCAs was conducted as early as 1902. In 1913 the suburban schools were expelled from the league and the Cook County League was reorganized as the Chicago Public High School League. Thus ended a great league that nurtured high school sports from infancy to maturity. The suburban schools formed the Suburban League (Chicago area).

Biological effects and thus also similarity of effects are usually quantified using the biological activity of a compound. In general terms, function can be related to the chemical activity of compounds (among others). Amphetamine and Methylhexanamine similarity The notion of chemical similarity (or molecular similarity) is one of the most important concepts in chemoinformatics. It plays an important role in modern approaches to predicting the properties of chemical compounds, designing chemicals with a predefined set of properties and, especially, in conducting drug design studies by screening large databases containing structures of available (or potentially available) chemicals. These studies are based on the similar property principle of Johnson and Maggiora, which states: similar compounds have similar properties.  Similarity measures  Chemical similarity is often described as an inverse of a measure of distance in descriptor space. Examples for inverse distance measures are molecule kernels, that measure the structural similarity of chemical compounds.  Similarity search and virtual screening  The similarity-based virtual screening (a kind of ligand-based virtual screening) assumes that all compounds in a database that are similar to a query compound have similar biological activity. Although this hypothesis is not always valid, quite often the set of retrieved compounds is considerably enriched with actives. To achieve high efficacy of similarity-based screening of databases containing millions of compounds, molecular structures are usually represented by molecular screens (structural keys) or by fixed-size or variable-size molecular fingerprints. Molecular screens and fingerprints can contain both 2D- and 3D-information. However, the 2D-fingerprints, which are a kind of binary fragment descriptors, dominate in this area. Fragment-based structural keys, like MDL keys, are sufficiently good for handling small and medium-sized chemical databases, whereas processing of large databases is performed with fingerprints having much higher information density. Fragment- based Daylight, BCI, and UNITY 2D (Tripos) fingerprints are the best known examples. The most popular similarity measure for comparing chemical structures represented by means of fingerprints is the Tanimoto (or Jaccard) coefficient T. Two structures are usually considered similar if T > 0.85 (for Daylight fingerprints). However, it is a common misunderstanding that a similarity of T > 0.85 reflects similar bioactivities in general (\\"the 0.85 myth\\").  Chemical similarity network  The concept of chemical similarity can be expanded to consider chemical similarity network theory, where descriptive network properties and graph theory can be applied to analyze large chemical space, estimate chemical diversity and predict drug target. Recently, 3D chemical similarity networks based on 3D ligand conformation have also been developed, which can be used to identify scaffold hopping ligands.

History  The history of British–Iraqi relations date back to the creation of Iraq in 1920, when it was controlled by Great Britain; by establishing separate provinces from Mosul to Basra. In the 19th century Europeans (mostly the British) began to take an interest in exploring, surveying, spying and trading in Mesopotamia, as well as in navigating its rivers. By 1914 there was growing anxiety about the security of the Persian oilfields on the other side of the Persian Gulf, these were the fields that supplied the Royal Navy. = World War I = British troops entering Baghdad. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of Germany and immediately became an enemy of Britain and France. Four major Allied operations attacked the Ottoman holdings. Eugene Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East (2015) excerpt and online summary. The Gallipoli Campaign to control the Straits failed in 1915-1916. The first Mesopotamian campaign invading Iraq from India also failed. The second one captured Baghdad in 1917. The Sinai and Palestine campaign from Egypt was a British success. By 1918 the Ottoman Empire was a military failure. It signed an armistice in late October that amounted to surrender.M.S. Anderson, The Eastern question, 1774-1923: A study in international relations (1966) pp 310-52. = The foundation of Iraq = By the end of World War I, British forces were in control of the three provinces (Baghdad, Basra and Mosul), and the British administration in Baghdad had to decide on their future. The Ottoman Empire had collapsed, leaving the former Arab provinces in limbo, and the colonial powers of Britain and France aimed to absorb them into their empires; however, the Arab and other inhabitants felt strongly that they had been promised independence. Iraq then became a British mandate, carved out of the three former Ottoman provinces. There was immediate resentment amongst Iraq's inhabitants at what they saw as a charade, and in 1920 a strong revolt spread through the country, the situation was so bad that the British commander, General Sir Aylmer Haldane, at one time called for supplies of poisonous gas. The mandate united the three disparate provinces under the imported Hashimite King Faisal. Apart from its natural geographical differences, Iraq was a complex mix of ethnic and religious groups. In particular the rebellious Kurds in the north had little wish to be ruled from Baghdad, while in the south the tribesmen and Shia's had a similar abhorrence of central control. In implementing their mandate, the British had sown the seeds of future unrest. There were other contentious issues. The Iraqis deeply resented the borders imposed on them that cut them off from Kuwait, a mini-state that they believed to be a part of their country. These borders also meant that Iraq had only limited access to the waters of the Persian Gulf. The British imposed a monarchy and a form of democracy but, even after the grant of formal independence in 1930, most Iraqis believed that the British really ruled the country. Iraq remained a satellite of Britain for the next three decades, under the terms of a treaty signed in 1930, which included the retention of British military bases and an agreement to train the Iraqi army. Ironically, this army became a breeding ground of resentment against the British presence, particularly amongst new nationalist officers. After the death of King Faisal in 1933 the country was virtually ruled by a group of colonels who saw themselves as the future liberators of an oppressed Iraq. =World War II= The Anglo–Iraqi War (2–31 May 1941) was a British-led Allied military campaign to regain control of Iraq and its major oil fields. Rashid Ali had seized power in 1941 with assistance from Germany. The campaign resulted in the downfall of Ali's government, the re-occupation of Iraq by the British, and the return to power of the Regent of Iraq, Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, a British ally.Ashley Jackson, The British Empire and the Second World War (2006) pp 145-54.Robert Lyman, Iraq 1941: The Battles for Basra, Habbaniya, Fallujah and Baghdad (Osprey Publishing, 2006). The British launched a large pro-democracy propaganda campaign in Iraq from 1941–5. It promoted the Brotherhood of Freedom to instil civic pride in disaffected Iraqi youth. The rhetoric demanded internal political reform and warned against growing communist influence. Heavy use was made of the Churchill-Roosevelt Atlantic Charter. However, leftist groups adapted the same rhetoric to demand British withdrawal. Pro-Nazi propaganda was suppressed. The heated combination of democracy propaganda, Iraqi reform movements, and growing demands for British withdrawal and political reform became as a catalyst for postwar political change.Stefanie K. Wichhart, \\"Selling Democracy During the Second British Occupation of Iraq, 1941–5.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 48.3 (2013): 509-536.Daniel Silverfarb, The twilight of British ascendancy in the Middle East: a case study of Iraq, 1941-1950 (1994). pp 1-7. =1950s= In 1955, the United Kingdom was part of the Baghdad Pact. HM King Faisal II of Iraq paid a state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1956. The British had a plan to use 'modernisation' and economic growth to solve Iraq's endemic problems of social and political unrest. The idea was that increased wealth through Oil production would ultimately trickle down to all elements and thereby thus stave off the danger of revolution. The oil was produced but the wealth never reached below the elite. Iraq's political-economic system put unscrupulous politicians and wealthy landowners at the apex of power. The remained in control using an all-permeating patronage system. As a consequence very little of the vast wealth was dispersed to the people, and unrest continue to grow.John Franzén, \\"Development vs. reform: attempts at modernisation during the twilight of british influence in Iraq, 1946–58.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 37.1 (2009): 77-98. In 1958, monarch and politicians were swept away in a vicious nationalist army revolt. In 1961, after Kuwait had gained independence from Britain, the Iraqi leader, General Kassem, claimed it as an integral part of Iraq and concentrated his troops on the frontier, with the intention of taking it by force. Britain was ready and dispatched troops stationed in the Persian Gulf region to dissuade the Iraqis from armed conflict. In 1979, Saddam Hussein, seized power in Iraq in the name of the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party, a secular organization devoted to achieving the unity of all Arabs. In September 1980 when Iraqi troops crossed into Iran, by the orders of Saddam; Britain was one of the nations that armed Iraq. A decade later however, Anglo-Iraqi relations timbered over when the UK supported the coalition forcing Iraq out of Kuwait. Present day =Iraq war 2003= Britain once again found itself in Iraq after an invasion in 2003. British forces were mainly based in the southern city of Basra, but after handing over Basra to Iraqi forces in 2007, both Iraq and Britain stressed the need to develop economic relations between the two countries. This was confirmed by the British Foreign Minister, David Miliband, during his current visit to Iraq on the occasion of his country's troops handing over the reins of security in Basrah to the Iraqi forces, and said: > \\"By spring 2008 our military presence in Basrah will be 2500 troops. We > would like now to focus on new prospects of cooperation in the economic, > political and military areas; our forces have been able to build close ties > with their Iraqi counterparts under the leadership of lieutenant general > Mouhan.\\" A statement issued by the Presidency of the Cabinet quoted Al-Maliki stressing his government's keenness to establish better relations with Britain and open horizons of joint cooperation in all fields, saying that the coming phase will witness the establishment of multiple projects for the reconstruction of Basrah and all other provinces, calling on the British government to contribute actively in these projects and help to support the development of the Iraqi economy. On 22 May 2011 all of the remaining British troops had left Iraq and were all redeployed to Kuwait after the Iraqi government rejected their request to stay in Iraq and to extend their mission.UK's Operation Telic mission in Iraq ends =Unlocking Iraq’s economic potential= Background Following three decades of conflict and international sanctions, Iraq’s economy is set to become one of the fastest growing in the world over the next 10 years. Its GDP growth rate for 2013 is forecast for around 14% - largely fuelled by a rapidly developing hydrocarbons sector which already generates around $8bn a month in oil revenues. On the back of this sizeable wealth stream, Iraq’s import demand is projected to increase by 150% by 2020, with major opportunities in sectors including: * power generation * infrastructure * healthcare * education * financial and professional services * telecoms * security * ICT British companies are especially well placed to capitalise on investment opportunities in Iraq, given the significant historical and cultural ties that exist between the UK and Iraq, as well as the UK’s solid reputation for quality and clean business practices. UK exports to Iraq totaled £782m in 2011, and exports of goods increased 40% last year. But there are still significant challenges to doing business here. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparency and decades of under-investment in key infrastructure all contribute to Iraq continuing to score poorly on global ease of doing business rankings. And while the UK and Iraqi Governments are working together to address a number of the major barriers to trade, Iraq remains a challenging market in which to do business, especially for inexperienced exporters. Security also remains a major consideration for companies looking to operate in Iraq, and visitors are strongly recommended to consult the FCO travel advice for Iraq prior to travelling. For most parts of the country, business visitors should also consider the use of private security when planning a trip. The UKTI commercial team in Baghdad can supply contact details of the private security companies operating in Iraq. The British government actions : * Encouraging the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government to pass and implement new legislation on hydrocarbons and revenue sharing. * Contributing to Iraqi development of a strategic vision for the energy sector. * Encouraging the Iraqi government to play a responsible role in OPEC and other international energy institutions. * Working with the EU on a strategic partnership with Iraq, including encouraging gas exports to the EU. * Supporting British companies to win high value contracts in Iraq. * Improving UK visa operations in Iraq. * Encouraging and supporting the Iraqi government to resolve the problems that prohibit business, and encourage inward investment. * Supporting increased private sector growth in Iraq, leading to job creation. * Building partnerships between UK and Iraqi colleges and universities to support improved learning and develop vocational, academic and professional skills. * Improving provision of education and training in the state sector. * Encouraging Iraq- funded scholarships to the UK. * Seeking reduced restrictions on banks eligible to issue letters of credit. * Encouraging a market open to foreign banks and support British banks’ efforts to enter and grow. * Supporting development of retail banking to provide small loans to private businesses and the public. UK Trade & Investment services UK Trade & Investment (UKTI) helps UK-based companies succeed in the global economy. They also help overseas companies bring their high-quality investment to the UK’s dynamic economy. UKTI offers expertise and contacts through its extensive network of specialists in the UK, and in British embassies and other diplomatic offices around the world. They provide companies with the tools they require to be competitive on the world stage. In Iraq, UKTI has commercial staff at the British Embassy in Baghdad, covering trade in the centre and south of the country – including Basra, and in the British Consulate in Erbil, covering trade in the Kurdistan region. UKTI Responsibilities UKTI’s commercial teams in Iraq are helping UK companies to identify opportunities in the country, and supporting them in accessing the market. They are also working with the Iraqi Government to identify and overcome obstacles to doing business in Iraq, including through the UK/Iraq Joint Ministerial Trade Council. The Iraq UK Gateway The Iraq UK Gateway is a UK based business and was established to facilitate business-to-business transactions by providing the Iraqi companies with credible access to the British market place and Industry, sourcing products as well as approaching established businesses to promote the largely untapped potential for Iraq-British cooperation. It offers British businesses a gateway to explore new business opportunities and to expand their market internationally. Iraq has all the success components and national will and determination to become one of the richest and most successful growing economies in the world. They work with both sides to overcome the challenges that exist and are well placed to encourage greater participation and engagement by British business in Iraq’s fast growing economy. They are currently a dedicated small team of professionals actively working with other professional associates and together they can help Iraqi and British businesses to navigate the sometimes challenging route to successful trading in and with Iraq and the UK.

The university offers graduate and undergraduate courses in many specialized fields as well as vocational training programs. The university was established in 1908 and celebrated its centennial year in 2008. It is one of the four 'Knowledge Eagle Universities of Nueva Ecija.' History left The Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology started as a vocational course at the Wright Institute in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija where young Filipinos were trained in woodworking and basic telegraphy, the said vocational course lasted until S.Y. 1927-1928 when the general secondary education course was transferred to Cabanatuan City. On June 9, 1929 the school was renamed Nueva Ecija Trade School (NETS) in accordance with Vocational Education Act 3377 of 1929. The NETS was based in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, offering vocational opportunities to the youth of the province. The first and only vocational course being offered then was woodworking. That course was an addition to the existing secondary curriculum inherited from the Wright Institute. To meet with the increasing demand for vocational education in province, on June 7, 1931 the trade school was transferred to Cabanatuan City. Enrolment increased; however, the program was interrupted in December 1941 by the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific. After the war, the trade school immediately reopened on September 6, 1945 and rehabilitation programs took place. The trade school continued with its mission of meeting the vocational and manpower needs of the students coming from both Nueva Ecija and nearby provinces. On June 8, 1948, a course in dressmaking was opened and for the first time female students were admitted in the school. A few years later, a food and cosmetology course was also offered. On May 28, 1953, the NETS was converted into the Central Luzon School of Arts and Trades (CLSAT) by the virtue of Republic Act No. 845. CLSAT was recognized as a center of manpower and vocational training for both the youth and the adults not only in the province but also in the whole of Region III. Series of developments continued until the CLSAT was converted into the Central Luzon Polytechnic College (CLPC) by the virtue of Republic Act. No. 3998 which was signed on June 18, 1964 by then President Diosdado Macapagal. Thirty-four years later, under the leadership of then University President Gemiliano C. Calling, the Bill converting CLPC into NEUST was signed by House Speaker Jose de Venecia on February 19, 1998 and was forwarded to President Fidel V. Ramos on February 24, 1998. The bill lapsed into Law on March 27, 1998 as Republic Act. No. 8612, converting CLPC into a specialized university the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology. Today, NEUST is expanding not only in terms of program offerings, number of students and land acquisitions, but also in terms of linkages with local and international entities. As part of the expansion, the University has brought its graduate and undergraduate programs in China and has also hosted the South Korea's Master of Science in Information Technology, which is being offered at NEUST by the Hannam University. Still expanding, NEUST hopes to soon be at the peak of development and excellence.\\"NEUST Profile\\" Campuses right right Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology, right Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology, right The Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology has fourteen campuses scattered around the province, namely: Main Campus: * Sumacab Campus, Cabanatuan City Campuses: * Gen.

14 November 1934 ) born Hugh David Evans, was a nineteenth-century circus performer and strongman renowned for his strength. Biography Born Hugh David Evans in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, his mother died two weeks after his birth due to puerperal sepsis. Evans was put to work as a child laborer in the slate mines of Pennsylvania and in Granville, New York. Coming from several generations of slate miners in Northern Wales on his father's side, his mother was a Pennsylvania German woman who was famed for her feats of strength in her Bethlehem neighborhood. One of her feats was reportedly lifting a 375-pound barrel of flour and carrying it up a flight of stairs. (George W Stark Detroit News) Evans was first introduced to the circus at 11 years old, when he attended the circus with his father in Rutland, Vermont. From then on it was in his blood to be a circus strongman. He practiced his feats of strength at home and would lift the heavy bundles of slate in the Quarries he worked in. Men would come from all around to challenge him at lifting the heavy bundles. By the time he was 16 years old, he was defeating all challengers. Lawanda lifting two large men using, in part, his jaws Evans left home in 1865 with a man named Comical Brown to barnstorm in the eastern United States. His father was mortified at a son of his becoming a show performer. As part of his act in his trouping days, Evans would lift a barrel of water and let four men climb astride it, weighing approximately 1000 pounds. He also would juggle a 35-pound chair, toss it in the air, somersaulting it several times, then catch it with his teeth. If someone would donate a silver dollar, he would bite it in half within a couple of minutes. He amazed circus goers and astounded P.T. Barnum by lifting a 1400 lb horse with his teeth. (Detroit Free Press November 15, 1934) In June 1882 while performing in Boston, Massachusetts at Forest Gardens, Evans became ensnared in a confrontation with John L. Sullivan, then the heavyweight champ. Evans out-lifted Sullivan by hoisting a barrel filled with water, weighing approximately 375-490 lbs, using one arm. His opponent was unable to lift the barrel and wanted to fight afterwards, but years later they became friends. Signor Lawanda worked for Dan Rice Circus among many other circus, he settled in Detroit Michigan and worked for E.W. Pop Wiggins traveling across the country and into Canada, he worked for the Wonderland theatre at the end of his career, which was a theatre in Detroit at Woodward and Jefferson. Evans died on November 14, 1934 in Detroit, Michigan. Family Evans's family consisted of his father David Robert Evans, stepmother Mary, sisters Jane, Hannah, Catherine, Ann, and brothers James David and Robert. Hugh married a Canadian farmer's daughter, Nellie McAleer, in January 1880 in Detroit, Michigan, and they had four sons - George, twins Fred and Frank Evans and John Evans(Lawanda)Son and owner of Globe bottling company in Detroit, Michigan.

The film involves Emanuelle (Laura Gemser) a photojournalist who discovers a woman in a mental hospital who is a cannibal who has tattoos of an Amazonian tribe on her skin. Along with Professor Mark Lester (Gabriele Tinti), the two travel to the Amazon with a team to discover the source of the long-thought-extinct tribe that still practices cannibalism today. The film is an entry in the Black Emanuelle series and features elements of cannibal films which had just gained popularity after the release of Ultimo mondo cannibale (1977). D'Amato referred it in an interview as \\"a reasonable commercial success, especially abroad\\".Palmerini, Luca M.; Mistretta, Gaetano (1996). \\"Spaghetti Nightmares\\". Fantasma Books. p. 77.. Plot In a New York City psychiatric ward, photojournalist Emanuelle learns about a girl there who was found in the Amazon rainforest. Emanuelle discovers that she appears to have been raised by the Apiaca, a tribe of cannibals thought to be lost. She contacts Professor Mark Lester, the curator at the American Museum of Natural History, and persuades him to come with her to the Amazon. Upon arrival at the Amazon, they are joined by Isabel Wilks, the daughter of the organizer of the expedition, and Sister Angela, who is going upriver to join a mission. Attacked by a snake, Emanuelle is rescued by hunter Donald Mackenzie, who joins the group together with his wife Maggie and their guide Salvatore and informs Sister Angela that her convent has been attacked by what they presume to be cannibals, and that no survivors remain. The group continues into the jungle, now being watched by natives in hiding. They find a severed head on a stake, and Sister Angela disappears to be found impaled the next morning. Meanwhile, the Mackenzies attempt to leave the group in an attempt to find a crashed plane containing diamonds. As they stumble upon the plane, they are attacked by a tribe of cannibals. Donald and Maggie are kidnapped. The rest of the group only arrive in time to see it happen. They attempt to find the cannibal village. Upon their arrival, the cannibals kill Salvatore and capture Isabel. Mark and Emanuelle manage to escape only to watch the Mackenzies being brutally murdered and Isabel impregnated by the tribe in preparation for sacrifice. To save Isabel, Emanuelle paints tribal symbols on her body to convince the natives that she is their water goddess, and carries Isabel away into the water where Mark is waiting in a speedboat. Shot at by the natives with spears, Mark, Emanuelle and Isabel still manage to escape unharmed.

Among them, was Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals, a film in the Black Emanuelle film series with a story co-written, directed and photographed by Joe D'Amato. D'Amato declared that he was \\"a real copy-cat\\", and that since \\"Deodato's film Ultimo mondo cannibale had been so successful we thought about doing something along the same lines commercially.\\" Fabrizio De Angelis co-produced this film, along with another D'Amato project La via della prostituzione. D'Amato said in an interview \\"Fabrizio and I had a company called Fulvia Cinematografica with which we had intended to produce other films. Instead, when we finished these two, we went our separate ways.\\" In contrast to some previous entries in the \\"Black Emanuelle\\" series, Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals does not contain hardcore pornography sequences. In a 1990 interview, D'Amato remembered that the film had been shot for the most part around a lake in the vicinity of Rome, and that the team gathered together all of the Filipinos who lived in Rome, or were there on vacation, and paid them to work on set for a week. Make-up man Fabrizio Sforza remembers the lake as being the Lago di Fogliano. According to Sforza, the shoot lasted two and a half weeks \\"with effects, extras, violence, love scenes. Incredible!\\" Release Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals was passed by Italian censors on 20 October 1977. The film was released in 1977. The film was released on home video by Twisted Dreams Home Video and under the title Trap Them and Kill Them by Twilight Video. Both releases have a runtime of 93 minutes. Reception From contemporary reviews, David Badder (Monthly Film Bulletin) described the film as \\"so preposterous as to be almost enjoyable.\\" Badder felt that D'Amato didn't understand his film was unintentionally funny, stating that this idea is \\"dispelled by [D'Amato's] typically frenetic direction and the solemn tone maintained throughout.\\" In retrospective reviews, Danny Shipka, author of Perverse Titillation: The Exploitation Cinema of Italy, Spain and France, 1960-1980 described the film as \\"fairly harmless compared to other cannibal films of the time, with the violence coming in the last 20 minutes.\\" and that the Black Emanuelle series was \\"pretty much running out of ideas and it definitely shows in this film.\\" Cavett Binion (AllMovie) gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"merely excruciating tedium punctuated by occasional kinky sex in the first half of the film and cheap, gag-inducing special effects in the second\\" and that the film was too \\"gory for softcore fans and too dull for gorehounds, this is basically a film with no target audience whatsoever.\\" On 5 April 2016, film critic Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com included Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals in his video series \\"The Unloved\\", where he highlights films which received mixed to negative reviews yet he believes to have artistic value. Describing D'Amato as \\"the Luchino Visconti of trash\\" who Roger Ebert would have appreciated, he praised the film for \\"its egregious excesses, its dimwitted good nature, its commitment to being as happily dumb as possible\\" and highlighted its positive portrayal of Emanuelle's character and sexuality, as seen when she poses as the tribe's goddess to save Isabelle. Noting its faithfulness to pulp magazine artwork and tropes, Tafoya concludes his assessment by describing the film as \\"a sweltering collage of beautiful ruin, like D'Amato put everying put everything burning a hole on Italian movie screens into a pan and boiled them into a delicious reduction. The Zack Snyders of the world could take a lesson from D'Amato: feeding our worst selves doesn't have to be a chore. It can be pleasurable\\".

It is situated at the eastern tip of the Hel Peninsula and guides ship traffic into Gdańsk Bay and the Bay of Puck.  History  The lighthouse on Hel has its origins in the 16th century when a fire was lit on the church tower at a height of 116 feet to guide ships. The structure burned down. In 1638 locals asked Gdańsk authorities to build a lighthouse on the peninsula. After deliberation, a wooden structure was erected circa 1640, with a range of about 6 miles. In 1667 it burned down, too. Two further attempts at construction failed as well. However, seafaring in this area of the Baltic remained hazardous, so around 1790 another effort was made. A site was allocated, including a lighthouse-keeper's residence. The light was to be lit every day. Though effectiveness improved, the lighthouse soon faced the problem of being obscured by growing trees. The construction of the first brick lighthouse started in 1806. Due to civil wars the effort dragged on until 1826. The brick lighthouse wasn't high enough and ships continued to sink between Jastarnia and Hel. A cannon was placed at the lighthouse, fired every four minutes, as a sound signal. This continued until the gunner died in 1910. A stone commemorates the event to this day. More improvements followed. The light source switched to a paraffin lamp and the structure was renovated. Electric light was installed in 1938 in the form of a 3000 watt bulb. During World War II Germans decided to take down the structure, since it presented a perfect target for air raids. In 1942 Germans ordered locals to erect a new lighthouse. It stood 10 meters to the southeast from the old one (now detonated). The new structure was modern, powered by electricity, and it's been in operation to this day. The 40.8-meter tower is painted red and octagonal in shape. The light source is a 1000 watt bulb, set 38.5 meters above sea level, with a range of 17 miles. The lighthouse is also a part of an air traffic control system. The lighthouse is a tourist attraction and open to the public during summer. Apart from the lighthouse itself, a few keeper houses remain, dating back to 19th century. Facing west, inland, one can see the Swedish Hill with an old lighthouse built during World War II to replace the one destroyed in Hel at the same time.

Overview An important initiative, led by industry, has been set up together with the European Commission. A group of 53 European stakeholders, composed of industrial and academic experts, has established a European Technology Platform on nanomedicine. The first task of this high level group was to write a vision document for this highly future- oriented area of nanotechnology-based healthcare in which experts describe an extrapolation of needs and possibilities until 2020. Beginning of 2006 this Platform has been opened to a wider participation (December 2006: 150 member organisations) and has delivered a so-called Strategic Research Agenda showing a well elaborated common European way of working together for the healthcare of the future trying to match the high expectations that nanomedicine has raised so far. Policy Objectives * Establish a clear strategic vision in the area resulting in a Strategic Research Agenda. * Decrease fragmentation in nano-medical research. * Mobilise additional public and private investment. * Identify priority areas. * Boost innovation in nanobiotechnologies for medical use. Topics Three key priorities have been confirmed by the stakeholders: * Nanotechnology-based diagnostics including imaging. * Targeted drug delivery and release. * Regenerative medicine. Dissemination of knowledge, regulatory and IPR issues, standardisation, ethical, safety, environmental and toxicity concerns as well as public perception in general and the input from other stakeholders like insurance companies or patient organisations play an important role.

Education  Slattery holds a Doctorate of Law from Oxford University, a Bachelor of Civil Law (1968) from McGill University, and a Bachelor of Arts (Honours English) from Loyola College of Montreal.  Academic career  Slattery joined Osgoode Hall Law School in 1981. He has previously held academic positions at McGill University, the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and the University of Saskatchewan, where he was Research Director of the Native Law Centre. Professor Slattery has been Senior Advisor to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1995 for his work on advancing aboriginal rights. Slattery was inducted as distinguished research professor at York University in 2009. Professor Slattery has been cited by the Supreme Court of Canada in more than a dozen decisions, including most of the important cases dealing with aboriginal rights. His central thesis is that native Canadians (unlike those in many other countries) were never conquered and have inherent sovereignty from being the first occupiers of the land. The Government of Canada has never acquired a legal or moral right to impose its sovereignty over them. The honourable approach requires the government to recognize the inherent rights of the natives, and to negotiate, consult, and establish treaties where they do not yet exist, rather than force aboriginals to go to court to assert their rights.

Unlike the French Emmanuelle series, this entry has been described as being closer to a sex-themed giallo, or as a combination of several genres: the rape and revenge film, the splatter film, the erotic film and the thriller. The film was written by Bruno Mattei and D'Amato. Bruno Mattei co-directed the film with D'Amato, but only D'Amato was credited. Plot  A young woman named Francoise, who is abused and degraded by her gambler-husband Carlo, eventually kills herself by jumping in front of a train. Her sister Emanuelle avenges Francoise's death by drugging Carlo and chaining him in a hidden soundproof room with a two-way mirror, and torturing him by having sex with various men and women in front of the mirror, making him watch the torrid goings on without being able to participate. She also injects him with LSD and causes him to hallucinate scenes of cannibalistic orgies. While he is still locked in the hidden room, Carlo also hallucinates hacking Emanuelle to death with a meat cleaver. As the coup de grace of her plan, Emanuelle enters the room and attempts to castrate Carlo with a scalpel, at which point he breaks free of his bonds and chases her around the house. Carlo eventually catches Emanuelle and butchers her in real life on her living room rug, when suddenly the police arrive at the house, alerted to the melee by a neighbor. Carlo retreats back into the hidden room and seals himself in to evade the police while they check the crime scene for evidence and cart poor Emanuelle off to the morgue, not realizing the killer is hiding behind the two-way mirror in the living room. Emanuelle's real revenge over Carlo occurs after her death, when Carlo realizes he locked himself in the hidden room without any water or food and the police have locked up the house as a crime scene for 30 days. Cast *Rosemarie Lindt as Emanuelle *George Eastman as Carlo *Patrizia Gori as Françoise (Francene) *Annie Carol Edel as Mira (as Karole Annie Edel) *Maria Rosaria Riuzzi as Pamela (as Mary Kristal) *Massimo Vanni as Robi *Eolo Capritti as bald film producer (Al Capri) *Giorgio Fieri as Alfredo (as Giorgio Fleri) *Luciano Rossi as card player (uncredited) * Brigitte Lahaie (added scenes found in German cut only) Production According to Bruno Mattei, the idea for the film was born when producer Franco Gaudenzi wanted to distribute a Greek pornographic film by Dimis Dadiras entitled The Wild Pussycat. Due to its explicit nature, the film would not have passed Italian censorship, which led to D'Amato and Mattei deciding to shoot a remake of it. Parts of the score in Emanuelle's Revenge were reused from Gianni Marchetti's music for The Last Desperate Hours and Summer Affair (Il sole nella pelle). Release Emanuelle's Revenge passed the Italian censorship board on November 5, 1975. According to Marco Giusti, some scenes of lesbian and anal intercourse were removed. In 1978, Erwin C. Dietrich bought the film, reedited it adding hardcore inserts with Brigitte Lahaie, dubbed it into German and replaced the original music with a score by Walter Baumgartner. This version was released under the German title Foltergarten der Sinnlichkeit (literally: Torture garden of sensuality). A VHS-release of this version was titled Die Lady mit der Pussycat. Reception In a contemporary review, David Badder (Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the film had characters that eschewed \\"any believable motivation\\", that \\"deadly dull sex scenes irritatingly tricked out with arty-crafty camera work, almost guaranteed to send the bulk of his frustrated audience into a deep sleep\\" and that the film was \\"burdened with a crushingly pretentious score\\". The review negatively compared D'Amato's work to that of Italian genre filmmakers Dario Argento and Riccardo Freda, stating that he had \\"none of [their] inspirational touches\\". In his 1999 book on the film's director Joe D'Amato, Antonio Tentori found that it skilfully combined eros and horror.

The second book in the Mage Wars trilogy, it takes place 10 years after the end of The Black Gryphon. The story is the continuation of Skandranon and the others from Urtho's lands. Plot summary The story takes place ten years after the end of The Black Gryphon. The k'Leshya tribe of the Kaled'a'in nation, along with the gryphons, some hertasi, tervardi, and kyree, have fled from the gates that they escaped before the Cataclysm from the end of the mage wars. They have traveled very far and have reached the ocean, and now have established a city called, White Gryphon. The city is named based on its shape, a large gryphon preparing for flight over the ocean, and the white gryphon, Skandranon. The city has established a council to govern all aspects of the city life. The council members consist of Skandranon, Amberdrake, Cinnabar, Judeth, and Snowstar. The Cataclysm has led to mage storms that causes magic to be unstable, meaning that many that had the mage ability have lost their powers, or are seriously weakened. Amberdrake as one of the council members brings up a man that is practicing as a kestra'chern illegally. Judeth orders for the arrest of this man, Hadenalith, through her position as the leader of the newly established Silver Gryphons. Hadenalith is arrested while he is molding a woman to be his slave. The city does not have a jail, and his crimes are not severe enough for instant death, so the Silver Gryphons decide to exile him to the forests on one side of the city, presuming that the animals will take care of him. Hadenalith is very upset about the interruption to his deeds and swears revenge on Amberdrake, and White Gryphon. Later, there are ships spotted by a gryphon, and Skandranon is contacted using the city's mind connection, Kechara. Kechara has been recruited by Judeth and is being used to communicate with the Silvers in White Gryphon. Some of the council members, Skandranon, Amberdrake, Judeth, and Tamsin, arrive on the dock and await the people to exit the ships. Amberdrake has identified the crewmen as members of the Haighlei, pronounced \\"highly\\", Nation, a nation of all black people. Three of the Haighlei crewmen exit the ship and claim that the land that White Gryphon is part of their country. Judeth makes a stand claiming that the gryphons flew from one part of the land to another and never saw any markers that showed that the land belonged to any other place. At this time, the crewmen finally notice Skandranon and decide that they need to contact their home city. After the discussion with their leaders, the crewmen decide to stay in the city of White Gryphon and then take Skandranon, Zhaneel, and their children (Tadrith and Keeneth), along with Amberdrake, Winterhart, and their daughter (Windsong) back to their nation. 1997 American novels Valdemar Universe American fantasy novels DAW Books books ","title":"The White Gryphon"},{"id":"16091177","text":"The European Security and Defence College (ESDC) is an EU body embedded in the External Action Service (EEAS) of the European Union (EU) that provides training and education at EU level in the field of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which is part of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

Wertheimer started working in 1977. Wertheimer graduated from the University of Vermont's Economics and Business Administration program and also studied Communication Arts at Concordia University in Montreal under the tutelage of Marc Gervais. Deeply influenced by Gervais, Wertheimer gave particular focus to French New Wave Cinema and the impact of Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and others is still readily apparent in his work. After a long career making theatrical feature films (including Deepa Mehta's Sam & Me which was honoured at the Cannes Film Festival the year of its release, box office champion Bollywood/Hollywood, also written and directed by Deepa Mehta) and television series (Friday the 13th: The Series; War of the Worlds; RoboCop: The Series; and including his Gemini for Best Series for Due South), Wertheimer made the choice to write and create his own material. In 2004, his first television series as co-creator and showrunner, Charlie Jade, commenced production in Cape Town, South Africa. Ultimately, 21 episodes of the program would be made. Charlie Jade was inspired by The Culture of Make Believe by activist author, Derrick Jensen. It was designed to echo Jensen's themes of corporate greed and arrogance and the futility of continuing to pursue an impersonal, materialist agenda on a global scale. These themes are apparent in the design of the story across three parallel universes as well as in the perspective of the main characters who are depicted struggling with the personal and ethical dilemmas triggered by their actions in these universes. In addition to South Africa, Charlie Jade has been broadcast in Canada, Japan, Eastern Europe, France and the United Kingdom. In 2008, the Sci-Fi Channel acquired rights to broadcast the show in the United States. Wertheimer's next creative effort was the television series Across the River to Motor City which he co-created with Denis McGrath. Produced in partnership with Richard Mozer and David Devine of Devine Entertainment, Across the River to Motor City was an examination of two stages of one man's life threaded through a mystery involving the conspiracy speculation surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Wertheimer lives in Los Angeles, California.

The primary star is a Wolf–Rayet star, abbreviated as WR, with a B0.5 main sequence star in close orbit and another more distant fainter companion. The WR star is surrounded by a distinctive spiral Wolf–Rayet nebula, often referred to as a pinwheel nebula. The rotational axis of the binary system, and likely of the two closest stars, is directed approximately towards Earth. Within the next few hundred thousand years, the Wolf–Rayet star is predicted to probably become a core-collapse-supernova with a small chance of producing a long duration gamma-ray burst. The possibility of a supernova explosion from WR 104 having destructive consequence for life on Earth stirred interest in the mass media, and several popular science articles have been issued in the press since 2008. Some articles decide to reject the catastrophic scenario, while others leave it as an open question. Scientists currently believe the odds of WR 104 posing a risk to be small. System The Wolf–Rayet star that produces the characteristic emission line spectrum of WR 104 has a resolved companion and an unresolved spectroscopic companion, forming a triple system. The spectroscopic pair consists of the Wolf–Rayet star and a B0.5 main sequence star. The WR star is visually 0.3 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence star, although the WR star is typically considered the primary, as it dominates the appearance of the spectrum and is more luminous. The two are in a nearly circular orbit separated by about 2 AU, which would be about one milli-arcsecond at the assumed distance. The two stars orbit every 241.5 days with a small inclination (i.e. nearly face-on). The visually resolved companion is 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the combined spectroscopic pair and almost one arc-second away. It is thought to be physically associated, although orbital motion has not been observed. From the colour and brightness, it is expected to be a hot main sequence star. Structure The rotational axis of the binary system is directed approximately towards Earth at an estimated inclination of 0 to 16 degrees. This provides a fortunate viewing angle for observing the binary system and its dynamics. WR 104 is surrounded by a distinctive dusty Wolf–Rayet nebula over 200 astronomical units in diameter formed by interaction between the stellar winds of the two stars as they rotate and orbit. The spiral appearance of the nebula has led to the name Pinwheel Nebula being used. The spiral structure of the nebula is composed of dust that would be prevented from forming by WR 104's intense radiation were it not for the star's companion. The region where the stellar wind from the two massive stars interacts compresses the material enough for the dust to form, and the rotation of the system causes the spiral-shaped pattern. The round appearance of the spiral leads to the conclusion that the system is seen almost pole on, and an almost circular orbital period of 220 days had been assumed from the pinwheel outflow pattern. WR 104 shows frequent eclipse events as well as other irregular variations in brightness. The undisturbed apparent magnitude is around 12.7, but the star is rarely at that level. The eclipses are believed to be caused by dust formed from expelled material, not by the companion star.  Supernova progenitor Both stars in the WR 104 system are predicted to end their days as core-collapse supernovae. The Wolf–Rayet star is in the final phase of its life cycle and is expected to turn into a supernova much sooner than the OB star. It is predicted to occur at some point within the next few hundred thousand years. With the relatively close proximity to the Solar System, the question of whether WR 104 will pose a future danger to life on Earth has been raised. = Gamma-ray burst = Apart from a core-collapse-supernova, astrophysicists have speculated about whether WR 104 star has the potential to cause a gamma-ray burst (GRB) at the end of its life. The companion OB star certainly has the potential, but the Wolf–Rayet star is likely to go supernova much sooner. There remain too many uncertainties and unknown parameters for any reliable prediction, and only sketchy estimates of a GRB scenario for WR 104 have been published. Wolf–Rayet stars with a sufficiently high spin velocity, prior to going supernova, could produce a long duration gamma ray burst, beaming high energy radiation along its rotational axis in two oppositely directed relativistic jets. Presently, mechanisms for the generation of GRB emissions are not fully understood, but it is considered that there is a small chance that the Wolf–Rayet component of WR 104 may become one when it goes supernova. If neither of the supernovae produced by the two stars generate a GRB, their compact stars will. If they both become neutron stars, or one of them becomes a black hole (the other should be a neutron star), the collision of the two compact stars will generate a gamma ray burst, sometimes even gravitational waves like this gamma ray burst that produced gravitational waves in 2017. =Effects on Earth= According to available astrophysical data for both WR 104 and its companion, eventually both stars will finally be destroyed as highly directional anisotropic supernovae, producing concentrated radiative emissions as narrow relativistic jets. Theoretical studies of such supernovae suggest jet formation aligns with the rotational axes of its progenitor star and its eventual stellar remnant, and will preferentially eject matter along their polar axes. If these jets happen to be aimed towards our solar system, its consequences could significantly harm life on Earth and its biosphere, whose true impact depends on the amount of radiation received, the number of energetic particles and the source's distance. Knowing that the inclination of the binary system containing WR 104 is roughly 12° relative to line of sight, and assuming both stars have their rotational axes similarly orientated, suggests some potential risk. Recent studies suggest these effects pose a \\"highly unlikely\\" danger to life on Earth, with which, as stated by Australian astronomer Peter Tuthill, the Wolf–Rayet star would have to undergo an extraordinary string of successive events: # The Wolf–Rayet star would have to generate a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB), however, these events are mostly associated with galaxies with a low metallicity and haven't yet been observed in our Milky Way Galaxy. Some astronomers believe it unlikely that WR 104 will generate a GRB; Tuthill tentatively estimates the probability for any kind of GRB event is around the level of one percent, but cautions more research is needed to be confident. # The rotational axis of the Wolf–Rayet star would have to be pointed in the direction of our planet. The star's axis is estimated to be close to the axis of the binary orbit of WR 104. Observations of the spiral plume are consistent with an orbital pole angle of anywhere from 0 to 16 degrees relative to the Earth, but a spectrographic observation suggest a significantly larger and therefore less dangerous angle of 30° - 40° (possibly as much as 45°). Estimates of the \\"opening angle\\" jet's arc currently range from 2 to 20 degrees. (Note: The \\"opening angle\\" is the total angular span of the jet, not the angular span from the axis to one side. Earth would therefore only be in the intersecting path if the actual angle of the star's axis relative to Earth is less than half the opening angle.) # The jet would have to reach far enough in order to damage life on Earth. The more narrow the jet appears, the farther it will reach, but the less likely it is to hit Earth.

It was published in 1958 by Gnome Press in an edition of 5,000 copies, of which only 3,000 were bound. It was reprinted as a second edition in hardcover by Meredith Press in 1969. Plot introduction The story revolves around protagonist Alan Donnell, having just turned 17 and living on a space ship for all his life. While mankind has finally mastered interstellar travel, it is still bound to the speed of light using so-called Lexman drives. As a result, spacefarers experience the FitzGerald contraction, aging only a couple of weeks during their flights, where -- depending on the actual distance traveled -- years or even centuries pass by. This leads to the strange situation that Alan biologically is 17, but 300 in earth years. Rumor has it that already in 2570, i.e. 1300 years prior to the story time, the Cavour hyperdrive was invented by seclusive scientist James Hudson Cavour, who however vanished after his has announcement that he finally achieved success. As a result, spacefarers have become somewhat separated from Earth and their colonies, typically only stopping for loading, unloading and maintenance overhaul where they live in almost ghetto-like spacemen enclaves, and otherwise living in the segregated community of their ships. For Alan, this setting feels increasingly constricted. Like his brother 8 years ago (experienced as just 6 weeks on the starship) on the last Earth stop, he leaves the starmen's enclave to explore earth. Being more lucky than his brother back then, he makes contact with a helpful wealthy gambler, Max Hawkes, who helps Alan find his brother and return him back to the ship. This time, Alan stays on earth -- and subsequently goes on a search for the Cavour hyperdrive. Finally succeeding in retrieving crucial information and, also thanks to the wealth inherited from Max, building the Cavour hyperdrive, his maiden voyage takes him to his father's spaceship, reuniting with his brother almost 8 years later, now being twins of same age again due to the effects of the Fitzgerald contraction.

The school is regarded as one of the best private schools in Japan. It currently has 1,200 students, 96 teachers and 24,000 graduates. History In 1906, Seien Girls' High School was established by Iwao Okamoto (1867-1942) as a private women's school with the goal of nurturing \\"excellent mothers\\", through his principle that \\"the first education of any great and wise person is his mother.\\" There were 8 teachers and 25 students in the beginning. School Symbol The school symbol is a yellow and red ribbon in the shape of an inverted heart. The yellow represents “reason” and red represents “passion”. The shape is curved at the bottom to represent “harmony”, and knotted in the center to show “unity”; the upward pointing tip represents “progress”. Characteristics Seien Girls’ High School places a strong emphasis on spiritual education. The martial arts Dojo is not just the hall where techniques are taught, but where the spirit is strengthed. Through an original program, students learn to identify right from wrong, and obtain social manners and true etiquette. The school, in response to the internationalization of society, conducts an Australian study tour for all senior students. Students learn to respect other cultures and how to coexist with other nationalities and nature. In preparation for this, in first year of junior high school, English language conversation classes are held by native English-speaking teachers in addition to regular classes. In the second year of junior high school, each class studies a different theme related to Australia . Also, students can apply for language training and a homestay at Seien’s sister school, Annie Wright in Tacoma, Washington, United States Twice a year in the spring and the summer, or language training and a home stay in England in the summer. English and mathematics classes during junior high school are conducted under a system of small groups divided into each course. In senior year of junior high school, class composition is arranged according to academic ability. In senior high school, a course system has been adopted that provides various original curricula, and guidance so the students can directly get into a university after high school graduation. Several famous Japanese women are graduate of Seien Girls school including Japanese Supermodel Nao Kageyama.

The Carthaginian army under Himilco (a member of the Magonid family and kinsman of Hannibal Mago), which had spent the winter and spring in the captured city of Akragas, marched to confront the Greeks at Gela. The Syracuse government had deposed Daphnaeus, the unsuccessful general of the Greek army at Akragas, with Dionysius, another officer who had been a follower of Hermocrates. Dionysius schemed and gained full dictatorial powers. When the Carthaginians advanced on Gela and put the town under siege, Dionysius marched from Syracuse to confront the threat. He planned to use a complex three-pronged attack plan against the Carthaginians, which failed due to lack of proper coordination. Dionysius chose to evacuate Gela, as the defeat caused discontent in Syracuse and he did not wish to lose his power. Himilco sacked the abandoned city after the Greeks had fled to Camarina. Background Carthage had stayed away from Sicilian affairs for almost 70 years following the defeat at Himera in 480, during which time Greek culture had started to penetrate the Elymian, Sikanian and Sicel cities in Sicily. This all changed in 411 when the Elymian city Segesta was defeated by the Dorian Greek city Selinus. Segesta appealed to Carthage for aid, and the Carthaginian Senate agreed to intervene on behalf of Segesta. Hannibal Mago of Carthage led an army which took the city of Selinus by storm in 409 and then also destroyed the city of Himera. Syracuse and Akragas, the leading Greek cities in Sicily did not confront Carthage at that time and the Carthaginian army withdrew with the spoils of war.Bath, Tony, Hannibal's Campaigns, p. 11 For three years, a lull fell on Sicily. No treaties had been signed between the Greeks and Carthaginians signaling a closure of hostilities. =The expedition of 406 BC= The raids of the exiled Syracusan general, Hermocrates, on Punic territory around Motya and Panormus provoked Carthage into sending another army to Sicily in 406 under Hannibal Mago.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, pp. 145-47 The leading Greek cities of Sicily, Syracuse and Akragas, had prepared for the conflict by hiring mercenaries and expanding the fleet, along with keeping the city walls in good repair. Although Syracuse was involved in the Peloponnesian War and with disputes with her neighbors, their government sent an appeal for support to Magna Graecia and mainland Greece once the Carthaginians landed in Sicily. Hannibal besieged Akragas in summer 406, which withstood the initial assault. While building siege ramps for future attacks the army was struck by plague and Hannibal along with thousands of Carthaginians perished. Part of the Carthaginian army under Himilco, Hannibal’s kinsmen and deputy, was defeated by the Greek relief army led by Daphnaeus, and the city was relieved. The Akragans were not happy with the decision of the generals (who refrained from chasing the defeated Carthaginians) and had four of them stoned to death. The Greeks then cut off supplies to the Carthaginian camp and almost caused a mutiny in the Punic army. Himilco saved the situation by managing to defeat the Syracusan fleet and capturing the grain convoy bound for Akragas. The Greeks, faced with starvation, abandoned Akragas, which was sacked by Himilco. The siege had lasted for eight months.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp. 163-170 =A tyrant rises= The homeless people from Akragas arrived at Syracuse and some made accusations against the Syracusan generals. In the assembly, Dionysius, who had fought bravely at Akragas, supported these accusations. He was fined for breaking meeting rules, but his friend Philistos paid the fine. The assembly deposed Daphnaeus and the other generals and appointed replacements, Dionysius among them. The Akragan refugees ultimately found shelter in Leontini. An appeal from Gela then reached Syracuse to send aid, as the Carthaginians were approaching that city.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, pp. 151-52 Dionysius started scheming to expand his power. He got the government to recall political exiles who were former followers of Hermocrates, and then marched to Gela, which was under the command of the Spartan Dexippus. Dionysius dabbled in the political feud of Gela and managed to condemn their generals to death. He gave his soldier double pay from the confiscated property of the dead generals, then returned to Syracuse to accuse his fellow generals of taking bribes from Carthage. The Syracusan government deposed the others and made Dionysius sole commander. Dionysius marched to Leontini, held an assembly, and after some stage-managed theatrics, promptly got the people to give him a bodyguard of 600 men, which he increased to 1,000. Then he sent Dexippus away and had Daphnaeus and other Syracusan generals executed. The tyranny of Dionysius had begun. Opposing forces Hannibal Mago had brought together an army recruited from Carthaginian citizens, Africa, Spain and Italy, and a fleet of 120 triremes to Sicily. The army had been reduced by plague and casualties at Akragas and it is not known if Himilco had received any reinforcements or recruits while he wintered at Akragas. The original forces may have numbered around 60,000 men,Caven, Brian, Dionysius I: Warlord of Sicily, pp. 45-46 and the survivors marched to Gela in the spring of 405. The Carthaginian fleet, which numbered around 105 ships after losing 15 triremes at Eryx to the Greeks fleet under Leptines,Diodorus Siculus, XIII.80 was at Motya and did not accompany the army. =Carthaginian cohorts= The Libyans supplied both heavy and light infantry and formed the most disciplined units of the army. African heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. Light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as the Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple-bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields, and short thrusting swords.Goldsworthy, Adrian, The fall of Carthage, p. 32 Campanian (probably equipped like Samnite or Etruscan warriors),Warry, John. Warfare in the Classical World. p. 103 Sicel, Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,Makroe, Glenn E., Phoenicians, pp. 84-86 but often were equipped by Carthage. Sicels and other Sicilians were equipped like Greek Hoplites. The Libyans, Carthaginian citizens, and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well-trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Numidia provided superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all-out charge. Carthage at this time did not use elephants, but Libyans provided the bulk of the heavy, four horse war chariots for Carthage,Warry, John. Warfare in the Classical World. pp. 98-99 which is not mentioned being present at Gela. The Carthaginian officer corps held overall command of the army, although many units may have fought under their chieftains. The Punic navy was built around the trireme, Carthaginian citizens usually served alongside recruits from Libya and other Carthaginian domains. =Greek forces= Large Sicilian cities like Syracuse and Akragas could field up to 10,000–20,000 citizens,Diodorus Siculus, X.III.84 while smaller ones like Himera and Messana mustered between 3,000Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.40–6,000Diodorus Siculus XIII.60 soldiers. Gela probably could field similar numbers. Dionysius brought 30,000 foot and 1,000 horsemen, recruited from Syracuse, allied Sicilian Greek cities, and mercenaries along with 50 triremes to Gela in 405. The mainstay of the Greek army was the hoplite, drawn mainly from the citizens by Dionysius, and had a large number of mercenaries from Italy and Greece as well. Sicels and other native Sicilians also served in the army as hoplites and also supplied peltasts, and a number of Campanians,Diodorus Siculus, XIII.80.4 probably equipped like Samnite or Etruscan warriors, were present as well. The Phalanx was the standard fighting formation of the army. The cavalry was recruited from wealthier citizens and hired mercenaries They were augmented by mercenary hoplites hired from Sicily and Italy and even mainland Greece. Some of the citizens also served as peltasts while the wealthier citizens formed the cavalry units. Sicels and Sikan soldiers also served in the force. Mercenaries provided archers, slingers, and cavalry. Gela under threat While Dionysius was busy with scheming his way to absolute power, the Carthaginian army had left their winter base at Akragas after destroying the city. Himilco marched along the coast to Gela, and set up camp near the sea on the west of the city, fortifying it with a trench and palisade. The Carthaginians spent some time plundering the countryside and gathering provisions prior to commencing siege operations. The Gelans had proposed removing their women and children to Syracuse, but the women insisted on staying put. Finally no one was forced to evacuate the city, and the Greeks kept up an active defense by harassing the Carthaginian foragers.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 172 =Assault on Gela= Himilco resolved on storming the city before any help arrived. The Carthaginians did not bother to build circumventing walls around Gela, they decided on direct assault. Despite Gelan resistance, the Carthaginians managed to move battering rams up to the western walls of the city and make some breaches in them. However, the defenders managed to keep the attackers at bay all day and repaired the walls at night. The help of the women in repairing the walls was invaluable. The Carthaginians had to start from the beginning the following morning.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp. 172-73 =Siege relieved= Apart from his political machinations, Dionysius had managed to make ready an army made of Italian and Sicilian Greeks and mercenaries, numbering at least 30,000 hoplites and 4,000 cavalry and a fleet of 50 triremes,Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, p. 62 and had marched at a slow pace to Gela. The arrival of this army lifted the Punic siege for the time being. The Greeks encamped at the mouth of River Gela on the western bank beside the city opposite the Carthaginian camp, close enough to the sea to direct both land and naval operations. Greek battle plan at Gela 405 BC. A generic representation, not to exact scale and path of troop movement are indicative and geographic features are partially shown because of lack of primary source data. Prelude to battle For three weeks Dionysius harassed the Carthaginians with light troops and cut off their supplies using his fleet. These tactics had almost brought disaster for the Carthaginians at Akragas, but it is likely that Dionysius chose to fight a pitched battle after three weeks because of the mood of his soldiers against a war of attrition. The Carthaginian army probably outnumbered the combined Greek force and Dionysius resolved to use stratagem to neutralize this enemy advantage.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 173 =Pulling a Cannae on Carthage= One hundred and eighty-nine years after the events at Gela, Hannibal Barca destroyed a large Roman army near a Roman supply depot in Apulia using perhaps the best- known example of the double envelopement maneuver. Dionysius almost pulled one off on the Carthaginains at Gela in 405, but given the difference in circumstances that existed at Cannae and Gela, the battle plan of Hannibal and Dionysius varied; and like Hannibal’s brother Hasdrubal Barca found at the Battle of Dertosa in 215, a field commander needs a certain amount of luck along with skilled subordinates and disciplined soldiers to coordinate the complexities of the maneuver correctly. The Greek battle plan The Carthaginians were camped to the west of Gela and Dionysius planned a three- pronged attackDiodorus Siculus, XIII.109.4 that had to follow a precise timetable. The Carthaginian cavalry was posted on the landward side while the mercenaries were on the seaward side, with the Africans in between inside the camp. Dionysius, observing that a seaborne force could attack the camp from the south, where it was open and lightly defended, decided on the following course: #A group of a few thousand light troops would land on the beach south of the Carthaginian camp under the command of his brother Leptines and attack the south end of the camp from the west, occupying the Carthaginian forces, while 4,000 Italian hoplites would march along the coast and attack the south end of the camp from the east. At the same time, the Greek cavalry, supported by 8,000 hoplites would engage the Carthaginians on the northern side of the camp. #Dionysius, with the reserve force and Gelan hoplites, would sally out from the West gate of the city and attack the camp once the Carthaginians were fully committed on the flanks of their camp.Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, pp. 63-72 Difference with Hannibal’s plan at Cannae The armies and terrain, as well as the circumstances at Cannae, differed greatly from those at Gela and the battle plans of Hannibal and Dionysius reflected this: *Hannibal planned to fight the Romans outside their camp while Dionysius planned to attack the Carthaginians within their camp. *Hannibal devised an unusual infantry formation to envelop the Roman infantry. He pushed the Carthaginian center forward, when the Roman infantry attacked and drove back the Carthaginians, Hannibal’s infantry posted at the end of the center attacked the exposed Roman flank and achieved a double envelopment. Dionysius formed no special formation, nor did the Greek center start the battle at Gela. The Greek troops were to attack the Carthaginian camp simultaneously from both sides and achieve a double envelopment before their center would get involved. *The Carthaginian heavy cavalry was to play a special part in dispersing the Roman cavalry, then attacking the Roman infantry from the rear. Dionysius planned only a supporting role for the Greek cavalry at Gela. Battle The plan depended on precise coordination between the three Greek detachments, or risked a defeat in detail for the Greeks. As things turned out, coordination was horrible: the sea-borne troops under Leptines achieved total surprise and together with the hoplites attacking along the coast broke into the Carthaginian camp. While this group fought with the Campanians and Iberians,Diodorus Siculus, XIII.110.5 the northern group was slow in arriving and did not launch their attack in time. This gave the Carthaginians time to first defeat the Greeks attacking in the south, where Leptines lost 1,000 men before giving way. The Carthaginians gave chase to the retreating Greeks, but Greek ships poured missiles on the advancing Carthaginians,Diodorus Siculus, XIII.110.6 which allowed the fleeing Greeks to reach Gela safely. Some of the Gelan soldiers aided the Greeks, but most held back because they feared leaving the city walls undefended. The northern Greek detachment meanwhile attacked the camp and drove back the Africans, who had come out to oppose them. At this juncture Himilco and the Carthaginian citizensDiodurus Siculus XIII.110 counterattacked, and the Campanians and Iberians also came up, routing the northern prong of the attack, with the loss of another 600 Greeks. The force under Dionysius got entangled in the narrow streets of the city amid the population and never attacked. The Greek cavalry was never engaged and the Carthaginians chased the Greeks back to the city. After the fighting ceased, Himilco had won the day. While the Greek army was far from beaten, its morale had suffered and Dionysius faced political unrest in Syracuse. The army may have been unwilling to resume the harassing campaign,Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, p. 63 and if the Greeks garrisoned in Gela had been bottled up by the Carthaginians, political enemies of Dionysius might take the chance to stage a coup in Syracuse. Dionysius chose to evacuate Gela and requested a truce to bury the dead. However, he instead slipped out that very night with most of his army and the population of Gela, leaving the battle dead unburied. A group of 2,000 light troops stayed behind, where they lit large campfires to dupe the Carthaginians into thinking the Greeks were staying put. The next morning, these troops also marched from Gela. The Carthaginians entered and sacked the near-empty city the following day.Diodorus Siculus 13.111.1-2 Aftermath Dionysius led the army to Camarina, where he ordered the population to leave town. The strategic problem for Dionysius had not changed, getting stuck in a siege at Camarina might still mean risking political disaster in Syracuse. The march to Syracuse was slow. Suspicion arose among the Syracusan citizens that Dionysius might be in league with Himilco, and a coup attempt was launched. The spoils of Gela included a famous statue of Apollo, which was sent to Tyre.Diodorus Siculus 13.112-113 =Syracuse discontent= Some of the cavalry, made up of rich former oligarchs, rode in haste to Syracuse and tried to take control of the city. Their attempt was clumsy, as Dionysius arriving at Syracuse found the gates shut but unguarded. He burnt down the gate and killed most of the rebels, while some of them managed to get away and seize the Sicel town of Aetna. The refugees of Gela and Camarina, distrustful of Dionysius, joined the Akragan refugees at Leontini. The position of Dionysius was hardly secure, as Himilco and his army, after taking and sacking Camarina, were marching for Syracuse.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, pp. 153-54 =Peace of 405= Instead of a Carthaginian assault on Syracuse, a peace treaty was signed between the belligerents in 405. Reasons for the treaty are speculated as: *Dionysius was indeed in communication with Himilco and agreed to a treaty favorable to Carthage in exchange for peace and recognition of his authority.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 154 This is highly probable based on the future events in the career of Dionysius. *The army of Himilco was struck by plague again. During the entire campaign, the army had lost almost half its strength to the plague.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p. 44 Himilco chose not to battle Syracuse in his weakened state and opted for the treaty, which mostly favored Carthage. *Unlike the Roman Republic, which always fought to achieve a favorable outcome,Goldsworthy, Adrian, Roman Warfare, p. 85 with treaties seen as temporary interludes, the Carthaginians were mostly willing to negotiate and abide by treaties as long as their commercial infrastructure was intact. Carthage had kept to the terms of the treaty after the Battle of Himera in 480 for 70 years. In 149, Carthage continually submitted to the ever harsher and insulting demands of the Roman consuls until they demanded Carthaginians to move to an inland location, ending all their commercial activities. Only then did the Carthaginians renege on the treaty. The terms of the treaty were:Church, Alfred J., Carthage, pp. 44-45 *Carthage keeps full control of the Phoenician cities in Sicily. Elymian and Sikan cities were in the Carthaginian sphere of influence. *Greeks were allowed to return to Selinus, Akragas, Camarina and Gela. These cities, including the new city of Thermae, would pay tribute to Carthage. Gela and Camarina were forbidden to repair their walls. *The Sicels and the city of Messene were to remain free of Carthaginian and Syracusan influence, as was Leontini. *Dionysius was acknowledged as ruler of Syracuse by Carthage. *Both sides agreed to release prisoners and ships captured during the campaign. The Carthaginian army and fleet left Sicily after the treaty. The plague was carried back to Africa, where it ravaged Carthage. Himilco was elected as \\"king\\" by 398. He would lead the Carthaginian response to the activities of Dionysius in 398. The treaty was to last until 404 when Dionysius started a war against the Sicels. As Carthage took no action, Dionysius increased his power and domain in Sicily and finally in 398 launched a war against the Carthaginians by attacking Motya.

Music Musically the album marks a return to \\"the more expansive elements of [Pierce's] sound [...] even though it features the fewest noise-scapes and most terse songs in Spiritualized's history.\\" The Observer Music Monthly has described the album's sound as \\"touching and harrowing [...and] belligerent.\\" > New songs such as \\"Death Take Your Fiddle\\" and, especially, \\"Sitting on > Fire\\" – which sounds as if Pierce recorded the vocal from his deathbed – are > eerily prescient, while \\"Don't Hold Me Close,\\" a tender duet with film-maker > Harmony Korine's wife, Rachel, recalls Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris [...] > Throughout the album there are interludes of church chimes, otherworldly > beeps and odd noises. In places it could be mistaken for an album of > elevator music made for funeral homes and released on electronic label Warp. > It is quite a trip. The album features a number of guest vocalists, including backing vocals from The Dirtbombs on \\"Yeah Yeah\\" and a duet with film-maker Harmony Korine's wife, Rachel on \\"Don't Hold Me Close.\\" The album also introduces a greater influence of string arrangements to Spiritualized's sound. Pierce credits the compositions of the album's orchestrations to his paucity of technical skill. \\"I don't write music. So I just sing what I want into a tape machine. That way I'm not limited by what I can't play.\\" The ending of the last track, \\"Goodnight Goodnight,\\" features a brief lyrical and melodic nod to Daniel Johnston's \\"Funeral Home\\" (from his albums Continued Story and 1990), which itself is a nod to Bruce Springsteen. Pierce has stated this was a 'thank-you' to the singer, as Pierce's first live performance after his recovery was supporting Johnston at a tribute concert, in which he played a version of Funeral Home, as well as two other Johnston songs.

Feedback was provided during training, and participants had to listen to the minimal pairs until the correct answer was given. Participants performed significantly better immediately after the 3-week training, and retained some improvements when retested after 3 months and after 6 months (although there was a decrease in recognition ability at the 6-month test). Reaction time decreased during the training period as the accuracy went up.

Biography  Mandrin has been called the Robin Hood of France. He became famous for his rebellion against the Ferme générale, the tax collecting agency of the French ancien régime (royal government). In his time, government taxes were levied on salt (the gabelle), tobacco, and farming. The tax collectors, called fermiers, or (tax) farmers, were in charge of collecting all taxes for the king, but the total amount of the tax to be paid by the population was not specified; the tax collectors needed to pay only the pre-agreed amount to the king, but could exact unspecified sums themselves. Many of them were greedy and became wealthy and powerful through their exactions from the poor. The tax collectors were therefore hated by the people. Louis Mandrin was born at Saint-Étienne-de-Saint-Geoirs, Dauphiné, a border province, in 1725. His family was well established in the region, but was no longer as prosperous as in the past. Louis's father, a horse merchant, died when Louis was 17, leaving nine children. Louis, the eldest, became head of the family. Mandrin's first run-in with the fermiers was in 1748. He was under contract to supply to French army in Italy with \\"100 mules minus three.\\" Unfortunately, crossing the Alps was difficult and most of the animals died on the way to their destination, Saint-Étienne-de-Saint-Geoirs. Mandrin had only 17 mules left when he arrived, and they were in such a sorry state that the tax collectors refused to pay him. Five years later, on July 27, 1753, Mandrin and his friend Benoît Brissaud were involved in a brawl and their opponents were killed. Brissaud was sentenced to death and Mandrin to the galleys. Mandrin managed to flee but Brissaud was caught and hanged in Breuil square (now Place Grenette) in Grenoble. On the same day, Mandrin's brother Pierre was hanged for counterfeiting. Mandrin declared a personal war against the tax collectors. Mandrin joined a gang of smugglers operating in the Cantons of Switzerland, France, and Savoy, which was then a sovereign state. They trafficked mainly in tobacco. Mandrin soon became head of this gang - a small army of some 300 men which he led and organised like a military regiment. They had warehouses for weapons and stolen goods in Savoy, and Mandrin believed himself out of the reach from the French authorities. During 1754 he organised six military-style campaigns. He and his men targeted only the most unpopular tax collectors, which gained them huge support from the local population. Mandrin bought goods (cloth, hides, tobacco, canvas and spices) in Switzerland, which he then resold in French towns without paying the Ferme Générale any of the tax due. The population was delighted with such bargains. Soon the French government passed laws forbidding the population to buy these smuggled goods. Mandrin reacted to the ban by going to Rodez and forcing Ferme Générale employees to buy his goods at gunpoint. The Ferme générale, exasperated by Mandrin's growing popularity, obtained help from the Royal Army, but Mandrin took refuge in Savoy, near Pont-de-Beauvoisin. The tax collectors then decided to enter the Duchy illegally, disguising their 500 men as peasants. Mandrin was betrayed by two of his men, and the tax collectors seized him at a fortified farm in Rochefort-en-Novalaise. When the King of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, learned of the French intrusion into his territory, he immediately wrote to the French King Louis XV demanding that the prisoner be turned over to him, and the French King agreed. However, the tax collectors were so eager to be rid of Mandrin that they had hurried through his trial and execution before the king's message reached them. Mandrin was tried on May 24, 1755, and sentenced to be broken on the wheel, a penalty reserved for serious offenders, in Valence, Drôme on May 26. He was executed on May 26, 1755, in front of onlookers, many of them sympathetic. His arms, legs and stomach were hit and broken with an iron bar and he was then hoisted on a wheel with his arms and legs under him. Mandrin endured the torture without a cry. After eight minutes, he was strangled to put an end to his suffering. His broken body was put on display. Many angry and sympathetic notes were left near the body. It was the beginning of the legend. Mandrin's struggle against the injustice of the Ancien Régime was discussed across Europe and the cause taken up by Voltaire (who compared him with the king of Prussia) and Turgot. A popular ballad arose, the Complainte de Mandrin, that was sung throughout France and is still known today. Its author remains unknown. Extremely popular during his life, Mandrin remains famous to this day, in his native Dauphiné, in the Savoie and to a lesser degree, in the rest of France.  La complainte de Mandrin (Mandrin's Lament)  The music of this ballad, which dates to the year of Mandrin's execution, 1755, is excerpted from an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, composed in 1733 : Hippolyte et Aricie. It was then covered anonymously under the title by which it is still known.

The Theme of Bulgaria was a province of the Byzantine Empire established by Emperor Basil II after the conquest of Bulgaria in 1018.Byzantine Military Organization on the Danube, 10th-12th Centuries, Alexandru Madgearu, BRILL, 2013, p. 63. Its capital was Skopje and it was governed by a strategos. The local Slavic inhabitants were called by the Byzantines Bulgarians.Mitko B. Panov, The Blinded State: Historiographic Debates about Samuel Cometopoulos and His State (10th-11th Century); East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450; BRILL, 2019; , pp. 96-97. Nevertheless the Bulgarians kept their nationality, which reached particular strength after the Second Bulgarian Empire was formed in the 12th century.Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasiljev, History of the Byzantine Empire, 324–1453; Volume 1; St. Arseny Orthodox Christian Theological Institute Collection; Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1958, , p. 320. Initially the Byzantine emperor Basil II issued an order that the tax system of the subdued Bulgarian kingdom continue to be applied in the annexed Bulgarian lands. The Bulgarian patriarchate was downgraded to an archbishopric called Archbishopric of Ohrid, that retained an autocephalous status. The Bulgarian aristocracy also retained its position. Troops were recruited mainly from the Bulgarian population. However, only ten years later after the death of Basil II, the Byzantine tax system was introduced. Slavic literacy, liturgy and traditions of the Archbishopric were in some places subjected to persecution. Some of the Bulgarian aristocracy had slowly but consistently been removed from its position. Many were sent on assignments in other realms of the Empire remote from the Balkans. This situation gave rise to discontent among the local population. Rebellions aimed at restoration of the Bulgarian state broke out. The first one rose in Belgrade in 1040. It was headed by Petar Deljan, grandson of Tsar Samuel. Another insurgence broke out in 1072 led by Georgi Voiteh in the town of Skopje. At the end of the 11th century the Byzantine domains in the Balkans became an arena of fierce hostilities. The Normans invaded from the south and the knights of the First (1096–97) and then the Second Crusade (1146–47) advanced from west. Most frightful were the renewed raids of the Turkic barbarians from the steppes, the Uzes, Pechenegs and the Cumans. At the end of the 12th century, formally Byzantium was the sovereign, but in many Balkan areas the Byzantine power was nominal. In 1185, the Normans landed in Dyrrachium again, moved east and looted Salonika. The chaos in the imperial domains encouraged the Bulgarians to restore their state with the rebellion of the brothers Peter and Asen, and Bulgaria sought again to dominate the Balkans.

Biography Tadamochi was the fifth son of Sakai Tadaoto by a concubine, and became daimyō in 1740 on the death of his elder brother Sakai Tadaakira. His courtesy title was Shuri-daiyu. His wife was a daughter of Matsudaira Sadanori of Takada Domain. In 1741 Tadamochi was appointed a sōshaban and jisha-bugyō simultaneously, and later the same year, he became Osaka jōdai. In 1747 his courtesy title was changed to Sanuki-no-kami and his court rank was increased from Lower 5th, Junior grade to Lower 4th, Junior grade. From 1752-1756 he was appointed the 21st Kyoto Shoshidai, and he added the title of Jijū to his honorifics. In 1754, the earliest recorded post- mortem examination in Japan was supervised by Tadamochi's personal physician. This investigation by Kosugi Genteki (1730–1791) was considered highly controversial by his contemporary peers. The autopsy involved an examination of the corpse of an executed criminal somewhere within the precincts of Jidoin Temple north of Nijō Castle; and the results were eventually published in Zoshi (Description of the Organs) in 1759.Goodman, Grant.

After receiving the plate he requested from the waitress, the man stabs himself in the chest, and pulls out his heart, places it on the plate and gives it to the woman. He explains that his heart \\"is actually [hers] now,\\" that he will never be able to get over her, and says \\"from now on every girl that I meet will be meticulously compared to the false memory of what you and I once 'had.'\\" The woman offers to return it after keeping it temporarily for a \\"shitty day\\" or when she needs to move something heavy, but the man insists that he is now \\"heartless\\" and thus will passively/aggressively ruin all his future relationships. The heart then comes to life, growing arms, legs and a mouth, and begins to sing the lyrics to the song on the counters of the diner using a piece of broccoli as a microphone before finally stabbing itself with a knife and pulling the man's head out of its body. The head looks around, staring off into space. The scene cuts back to the man staring out the window as the woman speaks. The woman finally asks, \\"Are you even listening to me?\\" The man simply replies \\"No.\\" Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse also made cameos as chefs in the diner.

From late 2011 relations between the two countries have undergone strained turbulence. The two countries share a close historical and cultural heritage. Turkey has an embassy in Baghdad, and had a consulate general in Mosul until its diplomats were kidnapped by Islamic State, while Iraq has embassies in Ankara and Istanbul. The ambassador of Iraq in Ankara, Turkey, is Mr. Abdul Amir Kamil Abi Tabikh, who has been the representative of Iraq since 5 March 2009. The Iraqi mission in Turkey includes a defense attaché and commerce office in Ankara, and a general consulate in Istanbul. The Ambassador of Turkey in Baghdad, Iraq, is Derya Kanbay, who has been in office since 20 January 2007. The Turkish Embassy in Baghdad also possesses a commerce office. The Iraqi cabinet in October 2012 announced that Turkish forces crossing into Iraq \\"is a violation of Iraq's sovereignty and security\\" as Turkish forces used military bases in Iraq against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Political relations in chronological order Despite the fact that Turkey-Iraq relations have different epochs in history, the two nations are interconnected by various cultural similarities, since Iraqis, along with Syrians, Lebanese, and Egyptians, have traces of Turkish ancestry owing to the chronology with the Ottoman Empire. In order to clarify the relations between Turkey and Iraq these different stages should be clarified. First of all, these two countries emerged as sovereign countries after the First World War; Iraq became a political unity as a British mandate, and Republic of Turkey became a sovereign country apart from the Ottoman Empire. Although Turkey became an official state in the international arena by the Lausanne Treaty of 1923, the Grand National Assembly in Ankara, founder of modern Turkey, was actually running the government since 1920. =World War I and emergence of two states= Before World War I, contemporary Iraq was part of the Ottoman Empire. Iraq under Ottoman rule did not have political unity. There were three administrative provinces (vilayet) in current Iraq, organised by Land Law of 1858 and Vilayet Law of 1864 of Ottoman Empire: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul provinces. Political unity of these three provinces came to fruition as a result of World War I and the invasion by the UK of this region. The Ottoman Empire lost World War I and signed the armistice of Moudros with the Allies on 30 October 1918. According to this armistice, the Ottoman Empire's southern border wasn’t clarified. The 16th article of the armistice says that Ottoman armies in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Hejaz should immediately surrender to Allies. However, Syrian and Iraqi borders were not clarified in this armistice and the Istanbul government did not accept Mosul as a part of Iraq. Moreover, Mosul was occupied by British forces 16 days after the armistice (15 November 1918) which is an illegal action according to international law. This was the beginning of the Mosul problem. The borders issue and Mosul Question is the first important issue between Turkey and Iraq. In the last meeting of Ottoman Parliament of Istanbul on 12 January 1920 an act called the National Act was declared. According to that act, the whole of those parts (of the Ottoman Empire), whether within or outside the said armistice lines which are inhabited by an Ottoman Muslim (Turkish and Kurdish) majority, united in religion, in race, and in aim, form a whole which would not be divided for any reason. The future of the territories inhabited by an Arab majority at the time of the signing of the Armistice of Mudros will be determined by a referendum. After the declaration of the National Act, Istanbul parliament was dismissed. However, the new parliament in Ankara which started an independence war based the independence war upon this act. So, while the Ankara government accepted the self-determination right of Arabs, it was the representative of Kurds and Turks. The Turkish government's claim was that there is no difference between Turks and Kurds, and the Government of Grand National Assembly of Turkey is the Government of Kurds just as much as the government of Turks. In 1923, a conference was organised in Lausanne, Switzerland, in order to end the Turkish War of Independence (Turkish: Kurtuluş Savaşı; May 19, 1919 – October 29, 1923). The Mosul case was one of the major problems in this conference. One of Britain's major aims was keeping Mosul as a part of British-ruled Iraq instead of Turkey. However, according to Turkish government, the representative of Kurds and Turks, demographically the Kurd and Turk dominated Mosul province should be part of Turkey. The border dispute between Turkey and Iraq could not be solved in this conference, and the discussion of the dispute was postponed. The third article of Lausanne treaty was that the frontier between Turkey and Iraq would be laid down in friendly arrangement to be concluded within nine months. In the event of no agreement being reached between the two governments within the time mentioned, the dispute would be referred to the League of Nations. After Lausanne, the negotiation process about the Mosul province was started between Turkey and Great Britain. The Halic Conference was organised on 19 May 1924 in order to solve the dispute. However, instead of compromising, the British side asked the Hakkari region to become part of Iraqi. By reaching a dead end, Britain was trying to bring the dispute to the League of Nations, where the dispute could be solved in its favour. So, the League of Nations established an impartial committee to investigate the dispute. In December 1925 the Mosul province was awarded to Iraq, leaving the League of Nations open to the accusation that it was little more than the plaything of the British and French governments. The Sheikh Said rebellion also weakened Turkey in terms of diplomacy. This Kurdish and Islamist rebellion was reflected in the international arena. While Turkey was struggling with a Kurdish rebellion its claims upon representing Kurdish people lost its reliability. Turkey's only small prize in the resolution of League of Nations was getting 10% of the Mosul region's petrol for 25 years. Turkey's calculated money on account should be £29,520,000. However, only £3,500,000 was paid to Turkey until 1955. Turkey claimed that they had unpaid credit of £26,000,000 by their share of Mosul petrol until 1986. In 1986 this credit account was removed from the budget. By 1923, Turkey had also consolidated its independence, expelling foreign powers from its vastly reduced territory, but maintaining positive relations with Western world for trade and developmental purposes. In Iraq, the League of Nations Mandate of 1920 gave control of the Iraqi province to the British, to the disappointment of Iraqi nationalists. From 1920 until Iraq achieved full independence in 1932, Iraqi relations with its former Turkish rulers were guided by the British and dealt primarily with British trade interests. =1932-1958: the Era of Pacts= During the 1930s, Turkey-Iraq relations were at their most cordial, with both the Hashemite King Ghazi (1912–1939) of Iraq and Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938), the founder of the modern Turkish state and its leader since 1923, continuing to maintain close relations with the British. From the independence of Iraq in 1932 to the republican revolution in 1958, the most significant events in Iraq–Turkey relations were the regional pacts: the Saadabad Pact and the Baghdad Pact. Turkey had two defence-military pacts between Middle Eastern countries in this era, and Iraq was the only Arab country in both of the pacts. In light of this knowledge it can be claimed that during this era Turkey and Iraq had a close, cooperative relationship. The Saadabad Pact The Treaty of Saadabad was signed between Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Turkey on 8 July 1937 in the Saadabad Palace of Iran. More than a defence pact, it was a nonaggression and amity pact. There were two major reasons leading the signing of this pact: to solve the border disputes between the members of the pact, and to express the independence of each state in the international arena. The second reason was especially important for Iraq. Except for Turkey, for the rest of the countries this was the first international organization of which they were founders. The 7th article of the pact was the major article between Turkey and Iraq. According to this article, each member of this pact accepts to avert the armed groups within their territory which are a threat to other member states. In other words, it was a way of ensuring that neither Iran nor Iraq would give any sustenance to Kurdish rebels on Turkish territory or vice versa. By the start of World War II, this pact lost its meaning, except for this article. The last summit of the Saadabad Pact was in 1939, and later the pact actually disappeared. The Baghdad Pact After World War II, international relations had changed not only in the Middle East but also globally. Iraq became one of the founders of the Arab League in 1945. This league was founded in order to provide a forum for Arab states, and leaving the door open for a possible future federation. First of all, the founding of Israel has radically changed the politics in the Middle East. Iraq took part in the first Arab- Israeli war in 1948 by sending 18.000 troops to defend the Jenin-Nablus- Tulkaram region. This war brought Arab countries together and promoted Arab nationalism and anti-Western ideologies in the region. As a result of pan- Arabism, in the early 1950s, Za'im in Syria examined the possibility of a union between Syria and Iraq. However, first Iraq discouraged Syria's aim, and later it became a remote possibility after the coup d'état in Damascus. Turkey opted to look in the other direction, being a part of the Western states and, after its accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952, placing itself firmly in the sphere of Western world. For Western countries, Turkey's strategic position was important. Turkey was an unsinkable aircraft carrier. At the same time Turkey could protect itself from the Soviet threat and modernize its army under the tutelage of NATO. These mutual benefits made Turkey a part of NATO. However, Turkey's recognition of Israel in 1948, and later its support of Western interests in the Middle East (e.g. Suez Canal Crisis) negatively affected its relations with the Middle Eastern countries. The Baghdad Pact emerged in this atmosphere, with Arab countries and Turkey going different directions. Different foci in their extended foreign relations, however, did not preclude Iraq and Turkey from cooperating in common areas of interest. The Baghdad Pact is the evidence of the cooperation between two countries. On 24 February 1954, Iraq and Turkey signed a mutual- defense pact intended to contain the growth of Soviet influence in the region. Later, in 1955, Iran, Pakistan, and Britain had joined the pact. Turkey's, and also Iraq's, aim was to make other Arabic countries members of the pact. However, this aim failed. First of all, Britain's membership to the pact affected Arab countries negatively. Then, Israel was a more important threat to Arab countries than the Soviet Union. Nasserism and Arab socialism were spread among the Arab countries, and more than socialism, imperialism was seen as an enemy. The Suez Canal Crisis of 1956 affected the pact negatively. Iraq as an Arab member of the pact could not stay neutral in the Suez Crisis. As a result, Iraq excluded Britain from the meetings of the Baghdad Pact and the King of Iraq joined the Arab summit in Beirut in a show of pan-Arab solidarity after the Suez Crisis. Despite the existence of those problems, Iraq was the only Arab member of the Baghdad Pact and tried to create a balance between Turkey, Western countries, and Arab countries. This experiment ended when Iraq found itself with a new military government and withdrew from the agreement on 14 July 1958, one day before the Baghdad Pact summit in Turkey. At the summit, the situation in Iraq was discussed, and the members of the pact send a message to the United States to step in on the situation in Iraq. Turkey was more aggressive than the other members of the pact and started to discuss a military intervention. However, the US did not want to take that risk and stopped Turkey. Then, on 31 July 1958, Turkey recognized the new government in Iraq and the tension in Turkey-Iraq relations decreased gradually. The Baghdad Pact was transformed into CENTO and survived until the Iranian Revolution in 1979. =1958-1990= Iraqi regime and its foreign politics changed after the coup d'état in 1958. As well as Iraq, Turkey had undergone a coup d'état in 1960. The army took control of the government, prepared and constituted a new, more democratic, constitution, then re-established the democratic process again. Turkey's relations with other Middle Eastern countries affected its relations with Iraq during the 40s and 50s. After the coup d'état, Turkish foreign policy shifted into a new era, which is not strictly pro-Western and is extremely dominated by NATO. Turkey considered Middle Eastern countries' concerns in its foreign policy making in this era and had better relations with the Middle Eastern countries. Petrol trade Turkey's new foreign policy strategy during the 60s and 70s showed its benefits during the oil crisis of 1973. OPEC countries declared that Turkey's oil supply would not be limited. Moreover, in August 1973 a petroleum pipeline project between Turkey and Iraq was started, Kirkuk-Yumurtalik, and the project became real on 3 January 1977. The pipeline was supplying 2/3 of Turkey's petrol demand. Water dispute The issue of water rights became a contention for the two countries beginning in the 1960s, when Turkey implemented a public-works project (GAP project) aimed at harvesting the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers through the construction of 22 dams, for irrigation and hydroelectric energy purposes. Although the water dispute between Turkey and Syria was more problematic, the GAP project was also perceived as a threat by Iraq. The tension between Turkey and Iraq about the issue was increased by the effect of Syria and Turkey's participation in the UN embargo against Iraq, after the Gulf War. However, the issue had never become as significant as the water dispute between Turkey and Syria. The 2008 drought in Iraq sparked new negotiations between Iraq and Turkey over trans-boundary river flows. Although the drought affected Turkey, Syria, and Iran as well, Iraq complained regularly about reduced water flows. Iraq particularly complained about the Euphrates River because of the large amount of dams on the river. Turkey agreed to increase the flow several times, beyond their means, in order to supply Iraq with extra water. Iraq has seen significant declines in water storage and crop yields because of the drought. To make matters worse, Iraq's water infrastructure has suffered from years of conflict and neglect. In 2008, Turkey, Iraq, and Syria agreed to restart the Joint Trilateral Committee on water for the three nations to better manage water resources. Turkey, Iraq, and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding on 3 September 2009 in order to strengthen communication within the Tigris-Euphrates Basin and develop joint water flow monitoring stations. On 19 September 2009, Turkey formally agreed to increase the flow of the Euphrates River to 450 to 500 cm until 20 October 2009. In exchange, Iraq agreed to trade petroleum with Turkey and help curb terrorist activity in their border region. One of Turkey's last large GAP dams on the Tigris, the Ilisu Dam is strongly opposed by Iraq and is the source of political strife. Iran-Iraq War and Turkey The establishment of military-backed regimes in Turkey and Iraq by 1980 helped strengthen relations on several core issues, as both governments supported secularist and anti- radical policies, stable borders, and closer ties with the West, needed by Iraq for its conflict with Iran and by Turkey in its desire to join the European Union. During the Iran-Iraq war, Turkey stayed neutral officially and preserved political and economical relations with both countries. However, with the whole Western world, indirectly Turkey supported Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. While Turkey was paying for the petrol with cash, Iraq was buying goods from Turkey by credit loaned from Turkey. That means that Turkey financially supported Iraq during the 1980s. =1990–2003: First Gulf War and after= Following the relatively stabilized era of 1960 to 1990, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 radically changed Turkey-Iraq relations. After UN SC Resolution 665, Turkey allowed United Nations forces to fly missions from its air bases. The allied coalition achieved its objective and had neither a mandate nor much desire to press on into Iraq itself. A ceasefire agreement was signed at Safwan on 28 February 1991. However, after the cease fire, both Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north of Iraq had risen in revolt. Kurdish forces captured Kirkuk on 19 March 1991 but Republican Guards of Iraq re-captured the city and hundreds of thousands of Kurds escaped to the Iranian and Turkish borders as relatively safe places. Following that incident, UN SC Resolution 688 was passed, which called on Iraq to end its repression of its own population and paved the way for the creation by the coalition powers of a safe haven north of the 36th parallel in Iraq (just south of Erbil). This safe haven became a very suitable place for the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization internationally by a number of states and organizations, including the United States, NATO, and the European Union. During the lack of authority in Iraq, Turkey's relation with Iraq was in a unique situation. The central government in Baghdad had no power in Northern Iraq but Turkey's core issue about Iraq was in Northern Iraq—Iraqi Kurdistan. So, unwillingly, the Turkish government created political relations with Iraqi Kurds, Talabani, and Barzani. An independent Kurdistan and division of Iraq's integrity was also a threat to the Turkish government. So, while Turkey was establishing political relations with Kurdish political leaders, it also signed a hot pursuit agreement with Saddam Hussein and made several military operations to Iraqi Kurdistan against PKK camps. The 'Border Security and Cooperation Treaty' was signed between Turkey and Iraq on February 1983 and the first military operation was made in the same year by the Turkish Armed Forces. Then these military operations repeated several times during the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Turkey launched 24 military operations to Iraq between 1983 and 2008. In this way, Turkey was practising its physical power in Iraq, threatening and balancing the Iraqi Kurdish political power as well as fighting against the PKK. Turkey found a pragmatic solution for its security problem in this unique situation but this situation was only a short term period and it changed after the Second Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq. =2003-post invasion= Turkey's relationship with Iraq has shifted to a new era after the invasion of Iraq. In this era, the integrity of Iraq is as important as PKK problem for Turkey-Iraq relations. The status of Kirkuk and Turkoman populations' rights are the subtitles of the disputes. Before the invasion, Turkey was called for the invasion by the U.S., but on 1 March 2003, Turkish parliament rejected being an active member of US-led coalition forces in Iraq. Such a decision of Turkish parliament was seen as both a reaction against the unilateral action of USA in the Middle East and the desire to keep Turkey away from the Iraq war. While Turkey was out of US plans on Iraq, Kurdish leaders of Iraq gained more power by allying with US during the war. Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which behaves like a semi-independent unit, eventually emerged, and its aggressive foreign policy disturbed Turkish foreign policy mechanisms. After 2003, political maps of the Greater Kurdistan, covering Turkish lands, were seen on the walls of state buildings of KRG. Furthermore, Massoud Barzani frequently talked about the problems of Kurdish people in Turkey and implied that he could mobilize the Kurdish people against the Turkish government. Lastly, Barzani also objected Turkey's offers regarding a permanent solution of Kirkuk's status problem and ignored Turkey's sensitivity regarding the basic rights of the Iraq Turkmen population. Such attitudes of Barzani simply meant that the KRG prepared to be an independent nation state and Barzani administration was open to use any tool pragmatically to protect its sovereignty. Also, Turkey's military operations were limited by a result of the invasion. Iraq soils had physically become US soil and Turkey always needed permission of the US to launch a military operation in Iraq. Limited relations with Iraqi Kurdish Leaders, military operations, and very limited relations with central government in the 1990s became useless. So, Turkey had been deadlocked in Iraq and needed a new strategy different from that of the 1990s. So, after 2008, Turkey came up with a new strategy: communication with all groups in Iraq. For both Sunni and Shiite Arabs, who want to keep Iraq unified, Turkey is an essential actor. Turkey's attitude towards the future of Iraqi Kurdistan and Kirkuk disputes can limit Kurdish leaders. So, in the new era, Turkey has relations with more political groups in Iraq. Turkish military presence in Iraq Based on agreements from 1995 and 1997 relating to Turkey's anti-terrorist operations against the PKK Turkey maintains a military force of some 2,000 troops in bases some 30 – 40 km inside Iraq. Bases are located in different locations along the Turkish border in Dohuk province. After initial deployment to a former Iraqi military airfield at Bamarni (), Turkish military control has expanded west of Bamarni to Batifa and to the east close to the town of Kani Masi (Qanimasi) in the Amadiya District. Turkey has also some 150 troops and 20 tanks at Mosul Bashiqa region part of the operations against Islamic state responsible for training Iraqi troops. On April 25, 2017, 5 Peshmerga fighters were killed during a Turkish attack on Sinjar in Iraq. Turkey claimed to have destroyed \\"terror hubs\\"; Iraq denounced the strike as a “violation\\" of its \\"sovereignty”. On August 23, 2019, Turkish army launched Operation Claw-3 in Northern Iraq against PKK.Turkey’s Claw-3 Operation continues in northern Iraq Current relations In an earlier sign that Iraq's neighbours were improving their ties with Baghdad, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became the first Turkish leader to visit Baghdad in nearly 20 years, in 2008. That visit sought to strengthen ties strained in early 2008 by attacks launched into Turkey by Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels based in remote parts of northern Iraq . Tensions have risen between the Kurdistan Regional Government (in Northern Iraq) and Turkey, as clashes between Turkey and the PKK continue. Following a 3 April 2009 speech entitled Global Economic Crisis and Turkey, given to the Chatham House Royal Institute of Foreign Affairs on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in London, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan said in response to questions on relations with Iraq that \\"we defend establishment of an Iraqi state on the basis of Iraq nationality. Common ground is being an Iraqi national. If you set up a Kurdish state, then others will try to set up a Shia state and others an Arab state. There, you divide Iraq into three. This can lead Iraq into a civil war.\\" On 1 May 2009, Ankara paid host to a surprise visit from Iraqi Mahdi Army leader Muqtada al-Sadr who, in his first public appearance for two years, met with Turkish President Abdullah Gül and Prime Minister Erdoğan for talks which focused on the \\"political process\\", and requested Turkey play a greater role in establishing stability in the Middle East. Spokesman Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi confirmed the nature of the talks that had been requested by Al-Sadr and stated that \\"Turkey is a good, old friend. Trusting that, we had no hesitation in travelling here.\\" After the meeting, al-Sadr visited supporters in Istanbul, where al-Obeidi says they may open a representative office, and attended a meeting with five Iraqi Parliament deputies. US State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Richard Schmierer later indicated Washington's support for Turkish engagement with al-Sadr and its involvement in Iraq in general. On 8 May, Kurdish Natural Resources Minister Ashti Hawrami announced, \\"Today I received an email message from the Iraqi Oil Ministry sending us their approval for the Kurdish Government to export oil through the Iraqi pipelines to Ceyhan [in Turkey].\\" Iraqi Oil Ministry spokesman Asim Jihad initially denied that these first official exports of Kurdish oil had been permitted but later confirmed that, \\"the Iraqi Oil Ministry will start exporting crude extracted from some oil-fields in Kurdistan.\\" Turkey's Genel Enerji Project Manager Mehmet Okutan, who is leading the joint development of Taq Taq in what is seen as a sign of growing trust in Kurd's ties with Turkey, stated, \\"We consider the start of the exports as a historic moment for us,\\" with Turkish Democratic Society Party (DTP) Deputy Hasip Kaplan adding, \\"The good economic and social relations between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds will serve peace efforts.\\" Iraq's parliament called on its government to renegotiate partnership agreements with Turkey, Syria, and Iran following a 12 May report from Iraqi Water Committee Chairman Karim al-Yacoubi that water levels had fallen to dangerous levels because neighbouring countries take too much water from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and their tributaries. Iraqi deputy Saleh al-Mutlaq attended a 22 May meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan and President Gül, while Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari at the 23 May meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers and announced, \\"We will give as much water as possible to our Iraqi and Syrian friends.\\" According to al- Mutlaq, \\"They have since increased the quantities of water coming to Iraq by 130 cubic centimetres per second. It is not enough, but it has partly solved the water problems preventing our farmers from planting rice.\\" Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki confronted the activities of the PKK, following the May 15 foundation laying ceremony of a Turkish-constructed hospital in Karbala, by claiming that \\"We have a reliable cooperation with Turkey to bring an end to this terrorist organisation and other organisations that want to damage other neighbouring countries, who are our friends. When it comes to Turkey's possible intervention in northern Iraq, the issue is more massive and complicated than it is assumed to be. There is the need for a grand cooperation\\", and \\"I know the mountains where the PKK take shelter; they are precipitous mountains. We will find ways to stop the activities of this terror organisation and to finish this organisation through cooperation and understanding between us and Turkey.\\" Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani confirmed, \\"The Turkish Army threatened an incursion. But with the dialogue built recently, all these problems have been overcome\\", and \\"I have always attached a great deal of importance to our relations with Turkey because Turkey is not only a neighbouring country but also very important for us.\\" On October 19, 2011, twenty-four soldiers were killed and 18 injured during a PPK attack in southeastern Turkey. Rockets were launched at security forces and military sites in the town of Cukurca. Turkey retaliated with air strikes on Kurdish sites in northern Iraq. Several rebels died. The Turkish parliament recently renewed a law that gives Turkish forces the ability to pursue rebels over the border in Iraq.\\" Iraqi President Barham Salih condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, stating that \\"Turkey’s military incursion into Syria is a grave escalation; will cause untold humanitarian suffering, empower terrorist groups. The world must unite to avert a catastrophe, promote political resolution to the rights of all Syrians, including Kurds, to peace, dignity and security\\".

Character history Brother Mouzone (from Arabic موزون mawzūn, meaning \\"judicious\\", \\"weighted\\"), is a drug enforcer and hitman from New York City. \\"The Brother\\" does not fit the usual picture of drug-trade \\"muscle\\"; he always wears a suit, bowtie, and glasses, and speaks politely and precisely. He is also quite erudite, reading magazines such as The Economist, Harper's, The Atlantic, The New Republic, and The Nation. His dress, and extremely proper and pious persona resembles those associated with the Nation of Islam, more particularly its paramilitary wing, the Fruit of Islam, although it is never explicitly stated that he belongs to either organization. Also, his character might be inspired by the Black Mafia, a criminal organization comprising mainly Muslim African Americans that has close connections with the Nation of Islam, but unlike those affiliated with the Nation of Islam approves drugs' traffic. Upon first encountering him, the street dealer Cheese mocked Mouzone's formal style of dress by remarking that he must either be in \\"the Nation\\" or still let his mother pick out his clothes. Mouzone reveals he is a Muslim by mouthing \\"Allahu akbar\\" repeatedly after Omar shoots him, and Mouzone believes he is about to die. He is always accompanied by his \\"man\\" Lamar, who runs errands for him. =Season 2= Avon Barksdale hires Mouzone to protect the weakened Barksdale operation from Proposition Joe's dealers, who are working the Barksdale towers as part of a secret agreement between Stringer Bell and Proposition Joe. Mouzone confronts and promptly shoots Cheese Wagstaff with snake shot. He then informs Cheese that the next bullet in the chamber is a copper-jacketed hollow point bullet of his own design. Cheese and his dealers flee. To maintain his alliance with Proposition Joe, Stringer dupes Omar Little into believing that Mouzone is responsible for the brutal murder of Omar's boyfriend Brandon. After Omar shoots Mouzone, Omar and Mouzone talk, leading Omar to realize that he has been tricked: the talk makes clear Mouzone is a ruthlessly efficient assassin who favors execution-style murder, so carving up Brandon and torturing him to death is not Mouzone's style. Omar calls an ambulance for Mouzone and departs. While recovering in hospital Mouzone informs Stringer that their agreement is \\"absolved\\" and later returns to New York. =Season 3= In season 3, Mouzone returns to Baltimore. He locates Omar's boyfriend Dante after seeking advice from Baltimore local Vinson. Mouzone beats Dante until he reveals Omar's whereabouts. Rather than exact vengeance on Omar for shooting him, Mouzone suggests that they find and kill Stringer Bell together. Avon, whose relationship with Stringer has become strained, after they repeatedly clash on strategy and Stringer reveals that he was responsible for D'Angelo Barksdale's death, reluctantly gives Mouzone a time and a place to find Stringer after Mouzone threatens the Barksdale organization's connection to New York. Before returning to New York, Mouzone releases Dante and gives Omar his weapon to dispose of.

The film tells the story of a young seabird who, after being cast out by his stern flock, goes on an odyssey to discover how to break the limits of his own flying speed. The film was produced by filming actual seagulls, then superimposing human dialogue over it. The film's voice actors included James Franciscus in the title role, and Philip Ahn as his mentor, Chang. Whereas the original novella was a commercial success, the film version was poorly received by critics and barely broke even at the box office, though it was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. The soundtrack album, written and recorded by Neil Diamond, was a critical and commercial success, earning Diamond a Grammy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Plot As the film begins, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is soaring through the sky hoping to travel at a speed more than 60 miles per hour (100 km/h). Eventually, with luck he is able to break that barrier, but when Jonathan returns to his own flock he is greeted with anything but applause. The Elders of the flock shame Jonathan for doing things the other seagulls never dare to do. Jonathan pleads to stay and claims that he wants to share his newfound discovery with everybody, but the Elders dismiss him as an outcast, and he is banished from the flock. Jonathan goes off on his own, believing that all hope is lost. However, he is soon greeted by mysterious seagulls from other lands who assure him that his talent is a unique one, and with them Jonathan is trained to become independent and proud of his beliefs. Eventually, Jonathan himself ends up becoming a mentor for other seagulls who are suffering the same fates in their own flocks as he once did.  Cast  *James Franciscus as Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a lesser black-backed gull who is bored of daily squabbles of food. *Juliet Mills as The Girl, Jonathan's love interest. *Hal Holbrook as The Elder, who banished Jonathan out of the seagull flock. *Dorothy McGuire as Jonathan's mother. *Richard Crenna as Jonathan's father. *Philip Ahn as Chang, Jonathan's mentor. *Kelly Harmon as Kimmy *David Ladd as Fletcher Lynd Seagull Production Director Hall Bartlett first read the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull in a San Fernando Valley barbershop when he impulsively decided to call the publisher, Macmillan, and then author Richard Bach, to buy the film rights. Bartlett suggested that the story needed to be told simply, without animation or actors, and acquired the property for $100,000 and fifty percent of the profits. He granted Bach final approval rights on the film and all advertising and merchandising \\"gimmickry.” During production, Bartlett declared, \\"I was born to make this movie.\\" Reception The film received mainly negative reviews at the time of its release. Roger Ebert, who awarded it only one out of four stars, confessed that he had walked out of the screening after forty-five minutes, making it one of only four films he walked out on (the others being Caligula, The Statue, and Tru Loved), writing: \\"This has got to be the biggest pseudocultural, would-be metaphysical ripoff of the year.\\" Gene Siskel gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and called \\"the dumbest, most patronizing movie of this or any other year.\\"Siskel, Gene (November 8, 1973). \\"'Jonathan' falls short on his wing and a prayer\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 2. Variety described the film as \\"a combination of teenybopper psychedelics, facile moralizing, Pollyanna polemic, and superb nature photography.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". Variety. October 10, 1973. 12. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a very beautiful and ingenious movie to look at\\" but noted, \\"The line between a fitting solemnity and outright farce is very, very thin and it is here rudely violated again and again.\\"Champlin, Charles (November 2, 1973). \\"'Seagull' Glides High and Low\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Try as he may, Bartlett cannot put Bach's words convincingly into the beaks of even trained seagulls. It's an impossibility and an abomination, an affront to man and bird and the general fitness of things.\\"Arnold, Gary (November 16, 1973). \\"'Seagull' Lays an Egg\\". The Washington Post. B1, B8. Others used bird-related puns in their reviews, including The New York Times critic Frank Rich, who called it \\"strictly for the birds.\\"Movie - Film - Review, Jonathan Livingston Seagull David McGillivray of The Monthly Film Bulletin was somewhat more positive, writing, \\"Heady stuff this is, probably appealing only to those already converted. But as a striking technical achievement, the film deserves recognition.\\" In his film review column for Glamour magazine, Michael Korda considered the film \\"a parable couched in the form of a nature film of overpowering beauty and strength in which, perhaps to our horror, we are forced to recognize ourselves in a seagull obsessed with the heights\\".Korda, Michael quote, page 544, Halliwell, Leslie Halliwells Film Guide, 6th Edition. Published by Grafton, 1987. . Awards and honors The film was nominated for the 1973 Academy Awards for Best Cinematography (Jack Couffer) and Best Film Editing (Frank P. Keller and James Galloway). The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers – Nominated Lawsuits The film was the subject of three lawsuits that were filed around the time of the film's release. Author Richard Bach sued Paramount Pictures before the film's release for having too many discrepancies between the film and the book. The judge ordered the studio to make some rewrites before it was released. Director Bartlett had allegedly violated a term in his contract with Bach which stated that no changes could be made to the film's adaptation without Bach's consent. Bach's attorney claimed, \\"It took tremendous courage to say this motion picture had to come out of theaters unless it was changed. Paramount was stunned.\\"Campbell M. Lucas, 80; Judge Became an Entertainment Law Mediator (obituary), Elaine Woo, Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2005 Neil Diamond sued Bartlett for cutting much of his music from the film. Diamond was also upset music composer Lee Holdridge wanted to share credit with him. Bartlett was ordered to reinstate the five minutes of Diamond's music score and three of his songs, \\"Anthem\\", \\"Prologue\\" and \\"Dear Father\\", and that the onscreen credits were to state \\"Music and songs by Neil Diamond\\", \\"Background score composed and adapted by Neil Diamond and Lee Holdridge\\" and \\"Music supervision by Tom Catalano\\". After his experience with the film, Diamond stated that he \\"vowed never to get involved in a movie again unless I had complete control.\\" Bartlett angrily responded to the lawsuit by criticizing Diamond's music as having become \\"too slick... and it's not as much from his heart as it used to be.\\" However, Bartlett also added, \\"Neil is extraordinarily talented. Often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneath.\\"\\"Having Survived a Tumor and The Jazz Singer, Neil Diamond Eases His Life Back into Shape\\", Carl Arrington, People, April 5, 1982 Director Ovady Julber also sued the film, claiming it stole scenes from his 1936 film La Mer. The suit was dismissed without a trial, petitioned on the grounds that extensive public school and cultural use of the film had robbed it of common-law copyright protection.

This was the Better Homes Movement, which was initiated in the pages of the Butterick Publishing Company's household magazine, The Delineator,The Library of Congress American Memory Website: http://memory.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?ammem/coolbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrlgs+dl1)) under the editorship of Marie Mattingly Meloney. The campaign celebrated home ownership, home maintenance and improvement, and home decoration as means of motivating responsible consumer behavior; it also expanded the market for consumer products. Annual local campaigns — or \\"better homes demonstration weeks\\" — encouraged people to own, build, remodel, and improve their homes and distributed advice on creating home furnishings and decorations. In 1923, another department publication promoted ethnic and racial homogeneity by urging potential home buyers to consider the \\"general type of people living in the neighborhood\\" before making a purchase. President Warren G. Harding and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover kicked off the first Better Homes Week in October 1922 for the National Better Homes Advisory Council. The campaign centered on the 100th anniversary of John Howard Payne’s song Home! Sweet Home!. The Better Homes Movement received broad support from both government and industry. Vice-President Calvin Coolidge served as honorary chairman of the Advisory Council of Better Homes in America, and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover was president of its board of directors. To commemorate the Better Homes Movement, a replica of Payne’s colonial home in Long Island, New York, was built on the White House lawn in Washington, D.C. More than a million people visited the Payne House, and newspapers across America promoted other small Colonial Revival cottages like it.1923 Roy and Dora Bennett Home in San Diego Because of the patriotic and national sentiment of these years so soon after World War I, many of the model homes exhibited various Colonial Revival architectural elements. Newspapers often published designs of modest homes that were affordable and attractive to encourage new home construction under the Better Homes program. Oakland Tribune Builder's Page, August 1922.

An example would be a person who might agree to visit a bar with his friends, but will go no further (i.e. not partake in drinking alcohol). *The second meaning is that of a point beyond which, once the decision to go beyond it is made, the decision and its resulting consequences are permanently decided and irreversible. An example would be to commit funds to completing a project (as opposed to deferral or cancellation); once committed, the funds cannot be spent on another activity, and the project will either succeed or fail. Origin Biblical link to John 8:6. Some have (perhaps erroneously) interpreted Jesus' writing in the sand, as drawing a line in the sand in order to address those who are about to stone a woman caught in adultery. However, the literal translation is not that he drew a line in the sand, but that he \\"wrote\\" (or \\"drew lines\\" in some translations) in the sand, an important distinction. The exact origin of the phrase is unknown: the Oxford English Dictionary suggests a transitional use from 1950, but a definitely figurative use only as late as 1978: There is reference to an actual line being drawn in several historical, or legendary, military events: *One of the earliest recorded instance is in Indian epic Ramayana where Lakshmana draws a line around the dwelling to protect Sita. This phrase is often used in India even today, and is called Lakshman Rekha. *In 168 BC, a Roman Consul named Gaius Popillius Laenas drew a circular line in the sand around King Antiochus IV of the Seleucid Empire, then said, \\"Before you cross this circle I want you to give me a reply for the Roman Senate\\" – implying that Rome would declare war if the King stepped out of the circle without committing to leave Egypt immediately. Weighing his options, Antiochus wisely decided to withdraw. Only then did Popillius agree to shake hands with him. * In 1527, during the second expedition for the conquest of Peru, the Governor of Panama sent two ships to Isla de Gallo to rescue Francisco Pizarro and his troops. Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: \\"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian.\\" Only thirteen men (The Famous Thirteen) continued with Pizarro, the others left for Panama. *In 1807 or 1808, the Maori tribe Ngāti Whātua won a battle against their Ngapuhi enemies on a beach at Moremonui in the far north of New Zealand. One of the victorious chiefs, Taoho, drew a line in the sand with his spear and ordered that no Ngapuhi were to be slain beyond that point. This battle, the first of the Musket Wars, was called Te Kai a te Karoro (the Feast of the Seagulls) because seagulls joined the victors in eating the slain.http://www.parkviewdargaville.co.nz/dargaville-tours-2.html *In the United States, the phrase is most commonly associated with Texas history surrounding the Battle of the Alamo, as it is attributed to Colonel William Travis, commander of the Alamo defense forces.Mike Cox, \\"Line in the Sand\\" In the waning days of the Battle (somewhere during March 3–5, 1836), with Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna having the Alamo completely surrounded, Santa Anna sent a messenger to Travis demanding surrender, or else everyone in the compound would be killed. According to the legend, Travis called the Alamo defenders together, explained that defeat was almost certain, and read the letter of surrender; Travis then (having chosen to die instead of surrender) reportedly pulled his battle sword, used it to draw a line in the ground of the Alamo, and asked for volunteers to cross over the line and join him, understanding their decision would be irreversible.The legend states that all but one of the defenders (including Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett) joined Travis on his side of the line; Tapley Holland would be the first over the line. Moses Rose was the only defender choosing to leave the compound. Travis then responded to Santa Anna's letter with cannon fire, whereupon Santa Anna replied by playing El Degüello.

Bush described the initiation of the Gulf War as drawing \\"a line in the sand\\". *In 1997, American progressive metal band Dream Theater released a song named \\"Lines in the Sand\\" on their album Falling into Infinity. *In 2003, British rock band Motörhead released a song named \\"Evolution (Line in the Sand)\\", which was used as entrance music by WWE wrestling stable Evolution. *In 2014, American rock band Linkin Park released a song named \\"A Line in the Sand\\" on their album The Hunting Party. *In 2016, English singer-songwriter and musician PJ Harvey released a song named \\"A Line in the Sand\\" on her album The Hope Six Demolition Project.

Description As with other members of its family, the leaf assembly is below ground, where carnivory occurs. Tiny bladders consume micro- organisms which multiply in wet soil. Above ground it consists of kidney- shaped, pale lavender or white flowers on straight slender stems. Flowering occurs mainly during the summer, but may be triggered at any time after a dry period. Habitat and distribution Utricularia livida can be found in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Eswatini, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It also has a widespread native range in Mexico. It grows as a terrestrial plant in boggy areas or shallow soils over rock at altitudes from near sea level to . Cultivation Like its relative, U. sandersonii, this plant is valued for its ornamental flowers and is grown as a houseplant. It does not tolerate freezing, so in temperate areas it must be cultivated under glass, in pans of damp sand in full sun. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.  Synonyms  U. livida covers a large native range and is an extremely variable species, which accounts for the high degree of synonymy. *Calpidisca denticulata (Benj.)

DiefenbakerCCGS stands for Canadian Coast Guard Ship is the name for a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker that had been expected to join the fleet in 2021–2022 but now is significantly delayed. The ship had initially expected to be in service by 2017. Her namesake, John G. Diefenbaker, was Canada's 13th prime minister. It was Diefenbaker's government that founded the Canadian Coast Guard in 1962. The ship was initially to have been constructed by Seaspan Marine Corporation as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. However, both the timing and location of this build is now uncertain. In February 2020, the federal government initiated a request to all interested Canadian shipyards to outline their capacity to potentially construct John G. Diefenbaker with the objective of securing service entry by December 2029. Project history Officially known as the \\"Polar Class Icebreaker Project\\" as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy (NSPS), the vessel's commissioned name was announced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper during a visit to Inuvik, Northwest Territories on 28 August 2008. The vessel has been identified as a Polar Class 2 icebreaker intended for year- round operations in moderate multi-year ice conditions. In early February 2011, STX Canada Marine was awarded the contract to design the new icebreaker for the Canadian Coast Guard. Although the majority of the design work will take place in the Vancouver offices of STX Canada, the design team will also include the Finnish engineering company Aker Arctic. The work was initially planned to be complete by the end of 2013. The project was then allocated to Seaspan/Vancouver Shipyards to build the ship at Vancouver after the company completed work on the Joint Support Ship project. However, the latter project was significantly delayed and in 2019 John G. Diefenbaker was removed from the Seaspan yard and may now be built elsewhere, though both the timing and location are uncertain. If built, the ship will eventually have a crew of approximately 100. She is estimated to be capable of carrying fuel and supplies to be self-sufficient for 270 days and be capable of making constant progress through of ice. The C$720 million project was announced in the 27 February 2008 federal budget as a replacement for the nation's largest icebreaker and the flagship of the Canadian Coast Guard, . Minister of Defence Peter MacKay stated that the icebreaker will be built in Canada. As of the award of the NSPS contracts, John G. Diefenbaker will be built by Seaspan in British Columbia. Former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Loyola Hearn announced the icebreaker will be homeported in his riding of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. He also stated that the vessel will be larger than Louis S. St-Laurent which she will be replacing. On May 30, 2008, Chuck Strahl the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development wrote about the proposed icebreaker in a letter to the editor of the Windsor Star. Strahl wrote that the icebreaker would help protect the Arctic environment, and Canadian sovereignty. In addition he wrote that the Canadian Rangers would be expanded, and that a new Arctic research centre would be built in Resolute Bay. Michael Byers, the Canada Research chair in global politics and international law at UBC, stated that \\"this icebreaker and new money for mapping is something that Arctic experts like myself have been calling for, for some years now. I hope it's real. I hope it's not just an election promise. We need it and we need it right now. But I'm still somewhat skeptical. This has been done before for cynical electoral politics.\\" The Canadian Coast Guard announced on 28 April 2010 that it was then \\"at the preliminary stages of conceptual design for the polar icebreaker. A \\"Request for Proposals\\" to undertake detailed design work was to have been ready mid-2011 with vessel construction to begin in 2013. However, continuous scheduling delays on other projects at the Seaspan yard, as well as budgetary increases, resulted in the reallocation of the planned icebreaker to another yard in 2019. In October 2012, a 1:25 scale model of John G. Diefenbaker was being evaluated in at the National Research Council's Institute for Ocean Technology in St. John's. Additional testing was carried out at Aker Arctic's ice tank in Finland. In May 2013 the Vancouver Sun reported that the Harper government acknowledged that both John G. Diefenbaker and the Royal Canadian Navy's new Joint Support Ships faced a scheduling conflict. According to the Vancouver Sun, because both vessels were scheduled to be built in the same facility, the Harper government would have to choose which project had priority, and went first. The Canadian American Strategic Review argued that John G. Diefenbaker better served protecting Canadian sovereignty than the Joint Support Ships, and should therefore get built first. However, on 11 October 2013 the NSPS Secretariat announced that the Joint Support Ships would be built first, followed by John G. Diefenbaker. This means that the new polar icebreaker was delayed and the Canadian Coast Guard will have to start necessary measures to keep Louis S. St-Laurent in service until 2021–2022. In November 2013, it was reported that the budget for John G. Diefenbaker was revised up to 1.3 billion Canadian dollars, almost twice the initial estimate. Melanie Carkner of the Canadian Coast Guard has said that part of the price increase was to cover future requirements for the ship. In November 2016, the Government of Canada announced a solicitation/request for proposals for the leasing of interim icebreakers under a fast track procurement process to fill the gap until and after John G. Diefenbaker reaches full operational capability. Chantier Davie Canada has proposed converting four existing icebreaking offshore vessels for this purpose: the US-flagged and the Swedish Tor Viking II, Vidar Viking and Balder Viking. Design = General characteristics = John G. Diefenbaker will have an overall length of and beam of . Drawing of water, the icebreaker has a displacement of 23,500 tonnes. She is projected to have a core crew of 60 and accommodation for additional 40 project personnel. Her facilities include laboratories and modular mission spaces, a moon pool, general purpose cargo hold and garage, multiple cranes and a helideck and hangar for two medium-lift helicopters. In addition, she is capable of receiving and refueling larger helicopters. John G. Diefenbaker will be classified by Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Her ice class is Polar Class 2, the second highest ice class according to the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements for Polar Class Ships. Furthermore, the class notation Icebreaker(+) will result in additional structural strengthening based on analysis of the vessel's operational profile potential ice loading scenarios. John G. Diefenbaker is one of the first vessels to hold this class notation. = Power and propulsion = John G. Diefenbaker will be fitted with a fully integrated diesel-electric propulsion system consisting of six diesel generating sets with a combined output of . The power plant, divided into two separate engine rooms, provides power for all shipboard consumers from propulsion motors to lighting in the accommodation spaces. Initially, two propulsion alternatives were proposed during the preliminary design: a traditional three-shaft configuration with a centerline rudder and a hybrid propulsion system consisting of two wing shafts and an azimuth thruster in the middle for improved maneuverability. Of these, the Canadian Coast Guard selected the latter with two wing shafts and a azimuth thruster. The combined shaft power, , is almost the same as that of the Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers and . This makes John G. Diefenbaker the most powerful diesel- electric icebreaker in the world and the third most powerful non-nuclear icebreaker after the two gas turbine-powered Polar-class icebreakers operated by the United States Coast Guard. The icebreaker is also fitted with an air bubbling system that provides hull lubrication and reduces ice friction during icebreaking operations. For maneuvering at ports as well as stationkeeping capability in Sea State 5 and currents of up to in open water, she will also be fitted with two bow thrusters. = Performance = John G. Diefenbaker is designed to break level ice with a thickness of and with a snow cover at over 3 knots. In terms of icebreaking capability, this ranks her just below the largest Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers. Her operational range at in Sea State 3 is projected to be over and she can operate in ice at full power for 25 days. The logistical endurance of the vessel will be 270 days. The new icebreaker will be able to achieve a maximum speed of about in open water, but her normal cruising speed is around 12 knots.

Biography Born in London, he was educated at Lancing College and acquired a love of mountaineering and the outdoors from his father through holidays in the Alps, the Tyrol and the English Lake District. He became interested in polar exploration while studying at the University of Cambridge under the tutelage of James Wordie and organised his first expedition, to Edgeøya, in the summer of 1927.Ann Savours, 'Watkins, Henry George (1907–1932)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 4 March 2008 Watkins also learnt to fly, as one of the first members of the Cambridge University Air Squadron. In 1928-9, Watkins made an expedition to Labrador, where he established a base at North West River and explored much previously unmapped territory, including Snegamook Lake. However, his most important expedition was the British Arctic Air Route Expedition of 1930–31. Watkins led a team of fourteen men to survey the east coast of Greenland and monitor weather conditions there, the information being needed for a planned air route from England to Winnipeg. In addition to meeting these aims, the expedition discovered the Skaergaard intrusion, and Watkins and two companions, Percy Lemon and Augustine Courtauld, made an open boat journey of around the King Frederick VI Coast in the south of Greenland.The sea canoeist newsletter - Kiwi Association of Sea Kayakers (KASK) The expedition won Watkins the 1932 Founder's Medal from the Royal Geographical Society, and brought him international fame. In addition, one of the members of Watkins' expedition, Augustine Courtauld, solo-manned a meteorological observation post in the interior of the Greenland ice pack during the 1930–31 winter, generating the first data set from this previously inaccessible location. The expedition also included as ski expert and naturalist Freddie Spencer Chapman, who would later gain fame as a soldier in Japanese-occupied Malaya. Watkins next attempted to organise an expedition to cross Antarctica, but in the depths of the Great Depression finance proved impossible to raise. Instead he returned to Greenland in 1932 with a small team on the East Greenland Expedition to continue the work of his air route expedition. On 20 August he went hunting for seals in his kayak in Tuttilik (Tugtilik Fjord) and did not return. Later that day, his empty kayak was found floating upside down by his companions. His body was never found. There is a memorial to him inside St Peter's Church in Dumbleton. Honours In 1932 he was awarded the Hans Egede Medal by the Royal Danish Geographical Society. (in Danish) Watkins is also commemorated by the Gino Watkins Memorial Fund, managed by the Royal Geographical Society and the University of Cambridge, which provides grants for polar exploration. Watkins Island, a sub-Antarctic island in the Southern Ocean, commemorates Watkins. The Watkins Range, Greenland's highest mountain range, bears his name. The Gino Watkins Glacier, in New Zealand’s Whataroa watershed, and the close peaks of Gino and Watkins on the Barrier Range, also commemorate Watkins.

A higher priority alarm will silence an already-sounding lower one; in order of priority, they are: # Collision Alarm # Diving Alarm # Missile Emergency Alarm # Missile Jettison Alarm # General Alarm # Power Plant Casualty Alarm The two missile alarms are used only on submarines that carry missiles. A mnemonic aid for the order is the question \\"Can Dead Missile Men Get Pro-Pay?\\"  Collision/Flooding Alarm  The collision alarm is used to warn of imminent collision or actual flooding and is accompanied by a succinct statement of the emergency such as \\"flooding in engine room lower level\\" (if possible; flooding is deafeningly loud). The alarm is a slowly rising and falling siren, rather like a stereotype American police car siren, which sounds continuously as long as the switch is held on. The collision/flooding alarm handle is a red star shape.  Diving Alarm  The diving alarm is sounded twice to signal a dive and three times for emergency surfacing, and is accompanied by either the announcement \\"dive, dive\\" or \\"surface, surface, surface.\\" The alarm is usually described as \\"ah- OOG-ah.\\" On early submarines, it was an actual motor-driven vibratory horn (called a klaxon after the popular Klaxon Horn used on automobiles); later classes used electronic signal generators in the General Announcing System (1MC) that did not sound much like a klaxon but were variously described as \\"blats,\\" \\"honks,\\" or \\"cow farts.\\" Motor-driven horns supplied by Benjamin Electric (Type H-9 horn) were installed in WW2 fleet submarines. Later motor- driven horns were mostly supplied by Federal Electric (later Federal Sign and Signal, changing finally to Federal Signal - Type H-8 horn) and are still found in certain applications today. Many modern submarines still have Klaxon diving alarms (mostly supplied by crew members or unofficial sources, usually not NAVSEA) paying homage to USN submarine tradition. The diving alarm handle is a green square. Activation of the contact maker causes the alarm to sound until released.  Missile Emergency Alarm  The missile emergency alarm is used to warn of any emergency involving ballistic or cruise missiles, and is found on s and on s with VLS tubes. The alarm is a fast jump tone, two high- pitched notes repeated several times a second. People asked to imitate the alarm often say \\"deedle-leedle-leedle\\" in a falsetto voice as rapidly as they can. The missile emergency alarm is an orange crown shape.  Missile Jettison Alarm  The missile jettison alarm is used to warn of the imminent jettisoning (not launching) of a ballistic missile, and is currently found only on an Ohio-class submarine. The alarm is a repeating rapidly rising tone, often compared to the \\"Red Alert\\" alarm from the original Star Trek series. The missile jettison alarm on Ohio-class submarines does not have a handle like other submarine alarms. It is a key-activated alarm that only sounds upon energizing the missile jettison panel located in the Missile Control Center.  General Alarm  The general alarm is used to alert the crew to any emergency not covered by another alarm including all varieties of battle stations. It is accompanied by a succinct statement of the situation, such as \\"fire in Machinery Two\\" or \\"man battle stations strike.\\" The general alarm handle is a yellow oval. One turn of the handle causes the alarm to sound for a predetermined amount of time; fourteen gongs is a typical length.  Power Plant Casualty Alarm  The propulsion plant casualty alarm is used to warn of any emergency involving the engine room. The alarm is a slow jump tone, two high-pitched notes repeated about twice a second, rather like a stereotype European police car siren. People asked to imitate the alarm often say \\"wee- ooo-wee-ooo\\" or \\"Dead-nuke, dead-nuke\\" in a falsetto voice. The propulsion plant casualty alarm handle is a pink T shape.  Testing  All alarms are tested regularly. The crew is first warned that testing is beginning, then each alarm is sounded from every alarm location. Because the general quarters alarm lasts for several seconds, the collision alarm is sounded very briefly to override and cut it off. The many locations whence the collision alarm can be sounded were once traditionally tested from stern to bow, beginning with the engine room lower level aft location sounding the alarm as briefly as possible, then each subsequent location sounding the alarm for a slightly longer period of time. By the time the torpedo room sounds the alarm, it is held on for several complete cycles of the siren. Today, the sequence of collision alarm testing typically goes from top to bottom and forward to aft. In this sequence, the aforementioned engine room lower level sounds his alarm last.

It specialises in the postal history and philately of France. Opened in 1946, the museum has been located on two sites in Paris. The museum was closed for redevelopment from 2014 to November 2019. Genesis The idea of a postal museum was first published by philatelist Arthur Maury after scale models of postal rail transportation were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris. Projects were written at the beginning of the 20th century, but nothing concrete was done. In 1936, Eugène Vaillé, a civil servant at the French posts' library, convinced Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones Georges Mandel to relaunch the project. By 1937, establishment in the Choiseul-Praslin hôtel was studied. Although the economic crisis of the 1930s and World War II prevented any actual opening, a semi-postal stamp was issued on 6 July 1939Depicting a Jean-Honoré Fragonard's painting about writing letter, the stamp was engraved by Jules Piel. Source: Dallay (2005-2006). Catalogue de cotations de timbres de France, page 182. and a ruling council was instituted in 1943 with Vaillé as president. After the war, finance and an inventory by Vaillé of the postal archives permitted the inauguration in 1946. The Musée postal de France (Postal Museum of France) opened on 4 June 1946 at the Choiseul-Praslin hôtel, in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. Its first collections were exhibited on 600 square metres and postage stamps constituted the main part. To help in managing the museum, an association was founded in 1947: the Société des amis du musée de La Poste. Not large enough, the Choiseul-Praslin hôtel was replaced by a new building of 1,500 square meters. It was built between 1969 and 1972 and was decorated with a front wall designed by André Chatelin. The front wall was depicted on the stamp issued for the reopening of the museum, in December 1973. A stamp engraved by Jean Pheulpin. The building is located near the Montparnasse station, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. The inauguration took place on 18 December 1973. Collections and activities Permanent exhibitions present objects connected with correspondence, transport of the mail, work of the postmen and philatelic and marcophilic items. In 1999, a room was created to exhibit the 3,500 postage stamps of France in chronological and topical order. Temporary exhibitions on the same topics take place regularly on the ground floor of the museum. In the upper offices, a philatelic library is available to the public, partly constituted by a loan from the Académie de philatélie. In the entrance, a philatelic counter plays the role of post office, with cancellations inspired by temporary exhibitions.

Industrial ecology emerged from several earlier ideas and concepts, some of which date back to the 19th century.  Before the 1960s  The term \\"industrial ecology\\" has been used alongside \\"industrial symbiosis\\" at least since the 1940s. Economic geography was perhaps one of the first fields to use these terms. For example, in an article published in 1947, George T. Renner refers to \\"The General Principle of Industrial Location\\" as a \\"Law of Industrial Ecology\\". Briefly stated this is: In the same article the author defines and describes industrial symbiosis: It appears that the concept of Industrial Symbiosis was not new for the field of economic geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article \\"Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio\\", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography. Used in a different context, the term \\"Industrial Ecology\\" is also found in a 1958 paper concerned with the relationship between the ecological impact from increasing urbanization and value orientations of related peoples. The case study is in Lebanon:  1960s  In 1963, we find the term Industrial Ecology (defined as the \\"complex ecology of the modern industrial world\\") being used to describe the social nature and complexity of (and within) industrial systems: In 1967, the President of the American association for the advancement of science writes in \\"The experimental city\\" that \\"There are examples of industrial symbiosis where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another...\\" The same author in 1970 talks about \\"The Next Industrial Revolution\\" The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-industrial symbiosis as a practical way for achieving this: In these early articles, \\"Industrial Ecology\\" is used in its literal sense - as a system of interacting industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. Industrial Symbiosis on the other hand, is already clearly defined as a type of industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.  1970s  Industrial Ecology has been a research subject of the Japan Industrial Policy Research Institute since 1971. Their definition of Industrial Ecology is \\"research for the prospect of dynamic harmonization between human activities and nature by a systems approach based upon ecology (JIPRI, 1983)\\". This programme has resulted to a number of reports that are available only in Japanese. One of the earliest definitions of Industrial Ecology was proposed by Harry Zvi Evan at a seminar of the Economic Commission of Europe in Warsaw (Poland) in 1973 (an article was subsequently published by Evan in the Journal for International Labour Review in 1974 vol. 110 (3), pp. 219–233). Evan defined Industrial Ecology as a systematic analysis of industrial operations including factors like: Technology, environment, natural resources, bio-medical aspects, institutional and legal matters as well as the socio-economic aspects. In 1974 the term of Industrial Ecology is perhaps for the first time associated with a cyclical production mode (rather than a linear one, resulting to waste). In this article, the necessity for a transition to an \\"open-world Industrial Ecology\\", is used as argument for the need to establish lunar industries: Many elements of modern Industrial Ecology were commonplace in the industrial sectors of the former Soviet Union. For example, “kombinirovanaia produksia” (combined production) was present from the earliest years of the Soviet Union and was instrumental in shaping the patterns of Soviet industrialization. “Bezotkhodnoyi tekhnologii” (waste-free technology) was introduced in the final decades of the USSR as a way to increase industrial production while limiting environmental impact. Fiodor Davitaya, a Soviet scientist from the Republic of Georgia, described in 1977 the analogy relating industrial systems to natural systems as a model for a desirable transition to cleaner production:  1980s  By the 80s Industrial Ecology was already \\"promoted\\" to a research subject, which several institutes around the globe embraced. In a 1986 article published in Ecological Modelling, there is a full description of Industrial Ecology and the analogy to natural ecosystems is clearly stated: In fact, in the above article there is an attempt to model an \\"industrial ecological system\\". The model is composed of seven major sections: industry, population, labor force, living state, environment and pollution, general health, and occupational health. Notice the rough similarity with Evan's factors as stated in the above section. During the 80s the emergence of another related term, \\"industrial metabolism\\", is observed. The term is used as a metaphor for the organization and functioning of industrial activity. In an article defending the \\"biological modulation of terrestrial carbon cycle\\", the author includes an extraordinary parenthetical note: = 1989 – Decisive articles = In 1989 two articles were released that played a decisive role in the history of industrial ecology. The first one was titled \\"Industrial Metabolism\\" by Robert Ayres. Ayres essentially lays the foundations of Industrial Ecology, although the term is not to be found in this article. In the appendix of the article he includes \\"a theoretical exploration of the biosphere and the industrial economy as material-transformation systems and lessons that might be learned from their comparison\\". He proposes that:Ayres, R.U. 1989. Industrial Metabolism. In Technology and Environment,J.H. Ausubel and H.E. Sladovich, 23–49. 1st. Washington DC: National Academy Press. The term \\"Industrial Ecology\\" gains mainstream attention later the same year (1989) through a \\"Scientific American\\" article named \\"Strategies for Manufacturing\\". In this article, R.Frosch and N.Gallopoulos wonder \\"why would not our industrial system behave like an ecosystem, where the wastes of a species may be resource to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on waste treatment?\\" This vision gave birth to the concept of the Eco-industrial Park, the industrial complex that is governed by Industrial Ecology principles. A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of Kalundborg. There, several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.The Kalundborg Centre for industrial symbiosis (2007) http://www.symbiosis.dk/ Frosch's and Gallopoulos' thinking was in certain ways simply an extension of earlier ideas, such as the efficiency and waste-reduction thinking annunciated by Buckminster Fuller and his students (e.g., J. Baldwin), and parallel ideas about energy cogeneration, such as those of Amory Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute.  1990s  In 1991, C. Kumar Patel organized a seminal colloquium on Industrial Ecology, held on May 20 and 21, 1991, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The papers were later published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, and they form an excellent reference on Industrial Ecology. Papers include:   All twenty three papers are available online.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA Volume 89(3). http://www.pnas.org/content/vol89/issue3/  21st century  The Journal of Industrial Ecology (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology (since 2004) have covered industrial ecology in the international scientific community. Principles of industrial ecology are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the circular economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. This maximizes the efficiency of exergy use. This strategy aims for a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.

As soon as it was released in 1995 it became a nationwide success in Russia, the leader at the Russian box office. It won the Nika Award and Kinotavr awards. It was followed by several other \\"Peculiarities...\\" films. Plot A young Finn, Raivo (Ville Haapasalo), studying Russian manners and traditions, convinces his friend Zhenya [Eugene] (Sergey Kupriyanov) to help him participate in a real hunt in order to better familiarize himself with its peculiarities. They band together with a company led by an ex-army general (Alexey Buldakov) and set off to a distant cordon in the woods, taking with them several cases of vodka. Waiting for them at the cordon is an eccentric huntsman, Kuzmich (Viktor Bychkov), who occupies himself with meditation and Japanese culture, and some big-city types from St. Petersburg. Instead of the expected hunt, Raivo finds himself encountering rampant drinking and adventures. The plot can be divided into several vignettes – an incident with a bear in a sauna, the fireworks, the story of the rural policeman who lost his pistol, the scene on the farm, the story about the cow being transported in the weapons bay in a modern bomber (Tupolev Tu-22M) in exchange for a bottle of vodka, the drive in a \\"borrowed\\" police car UAZ to get to know some local milkmaids, etc. In the whirlwind of drinking and good times, the hunt itself takes a secondary or even tertiary position. The second plot line are the Finn’s daydreams of a real hunt based on his impressions from classic Russian literature. Short episodes from the pre-revolutionary period periodically appear throughout the film as inserts woven into the primary storyline. “Historical” hunting differs greatly form the modern version. The participants of the traditional hunt, unlike their would-be hunter contemporaries, enjoy conversation in French, flirting with women and constant treats without forgetting what’s important – tracking a large wolf. The contrasting story lines of the foolish contemporary fumbling and the circumspect traditional entertainment intersect in the finale. Raivo's surreal experience is highlighted by several peculiar incidents. e.g. Kuzmich picking a pineapple from the hedgerow, Earth being visible in the night sky etc. A notable feature of the film is the range of different languages which are spoken by the characters throughout: Russian, English, Finnish, German, and French.

History Preserved Plaxton Supreme bodied Leyland Leopard in 2009 In 1902, Robert Holt commenced a parcels delivery service in the Rochdale area using a pony and cart. In 1904, Holt went into partnership with his younger brother Ernest and they established themselves as carriers trading as Messrs Holt Brothers. Additional ponies and carts were purchased, later followed by steam and motor lorries.Messers Holt Brothers Yelloway Motor Coach Museum In an attempt to earn additional revenue, when the lorries would otherwise be idle, interchangeable charabanc bodies to enable the lorries to be converted into passenger pleasure vehicles at weekends. In May 1913 the first purpose built charabanc entered service, a 28-seat Dennis painted in a yellow livery with burgundy upholstery. When it arrived at the offices of Holt Bros in Rochdale a member of staff shouted \\"The Yellow Car has arrived!\\" This remark was the birth of the trading name Holts Yellow Cars. In November 1915, the company was incorporated as Holt Bros (Rochdale) Limited. The company extended its operations into Manchester and Oldham. It diversified into stage carriage services in 1921. On 1 October 1928, an express service linking Blackpool with London commenced. In 1930 the business was placed in administration. In March 1931, a consortium of Maurice Edwards, John Barlow and Herbert Allen purchased the business. On 9 April 1932, the company was officially renamed Yelloway Motor Services Limited. Yelloway was granted operating licences for a service to Torquay, with other operators denied. By 1937, Yelloway was providing travel facilities for passengers from West Yorkshire to destinations in South West England, connecting services being provided by Ripponden & District through Halifax, Sowerby Bridge and Ripponden to Oldham where they joined the Devon bound coaches.The first few years to 1945 Yelloway Motor Coach Museum World War II caused the curtailment of a number of services, including the London express. In 1944, Maurice Edwards indicated his desire to sell his stake. In order that no additional borrowing was undertaken, which may have put the company into debt, the Manchester to Rochdale service was sold on 18 June 1944 to Manchester, Rochdale and Oldham Corporations. In 1947, Yelloway acquired the operation of Brierley Brothers, Rochdale which included tour and excursion licences and an express route to North Wales from Rochdale and Oldham. In 1955, Holts of Oldham was purchased. This business had been set up by the original founders of Holt Brothers because of licensing difficulties in Oldham and, although at one time it had been planned to merge the two operations this had never been done and the Oldham company had continued to trade separately.The post war travel boom Yelloway Motor Coach Museum Blue Bird Tours, Hollinwood was also acquired, including excursions licences from the Oldham area and a number of express services, including a Hyde to Cleveleys route, which was retained, although the Oldham to Market Drayton service was sold to the North Western Road Car Company. In 1959, Yelloway acquired three more operators, taking over the businesses of the Rossendale Division Carriage Company, Johnston Bros (Middleton), and Merriway Tours. In 1961, the excursion licences of Turner Brothers, Todmorden were purchased, followed in 1964 by the excursion licences of Chas Holt & Sons, Whitworth, Kershaws Luxury Tours of Rochdale in 1967. In 1968 the related businesses of William Makinson (Manchester) Limited and North Manchester Motor Coaches Limited were acquired, in addition to excursion licences the latter company held express service licences to Blackpool and North Wales.Decline & demise Yelloway Motor Coach Museum In 1976 an agreement was reached with National Bus Company that saw Yelloway relinquish its London express routes in return National Bus Company's interests in the Fylde Coast Pool were handed over to Yelloway, which became the sole operator on the routes. In January 1984, following a revision by National Express, routes were allocated service numbers; *841: Rochdale to Poole (jointly with National Express) *845: Rochdale to Swansea (jointly with National Express) *877: Blackburn to Clacton-on-Sea (jointly with Premier Travel) *878: Blackpool to Clacton-on-Sea (jointly with Premier Travel) *883: Rochdale to Plymouth *884: Rochdale to Paignton *885: Rochdale to Bournemouth *886: Rochdale to Southampton *890: Burnley to Paignton On 5 July 1985, Yelloway was sold to Neoplan dealer Carlton PSV Sales of Rotherham.Importer buys Yelloway Commercial Motor 20 July 1985 In October 1986, following deregulation, Yelloway registered several stage carriage services in the Greater Manchester area and won contracts from the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive. By 1987 the services run jointly with Premier Travel were no longer operating and National Express services had replaced them. Instead, Yelloway was contracted to run two journeys a day on the Burnley to Harwich services 351 and 352. Most of the remaining coach work undertaken by Yelloway at this time was under contract to National Express and this was transferred to Carlton PSV Sales' parent ATL Holdings newly acquired National Travel East subsidiary along with most of the coach fleet.NBC sells Tracky Commercial Motor 7 February 1987 The last remaining vestige of the Yelloway express network was the Blackpool route through Oldham and Rochdale areas, but by late 1988 this too had gone. In return a motley collection of second-hand vehicles came to Yelloway to operate the stage carriage services.

This move also may be executed on the ground in rapid succession as part of a cheerleading/gymnastics/acrobatics routine. Compared to a full back (full twisting back somersault), a double full is a more advanced move. It's not often seen in high-grade routines because it has only 360° of somersault rotation. The performer sharply and tightly brings the arms down to the sides and maintains a straight body position to speed up the rotation generated from a full back. Variations of this twist-acceleration process include folding the arms one above the other across the midsection or crossing the arms to form an \\"X\\" shape across the chest. The latter is becoming less common due to debate over its safety. Double fulls are usually performed in the straight position, though they may be performed in both tucked and piked shapes. The straight shape is most common, however, since it helps to slow the somersault rotation down. As somersault rotation is sped up greatly with the addition of twist, keeping rotation low is important, especially as there is a great deal of twist rotation involved in the move.

It was relatively easy to build from plans, it flew well, and the aircraft was strong enough to handle mild aerobatics and the occasional hard landing. When the Baby first appeared, it was accepted wisdom that the pilot should feel as much unimpeded airflow as possible, to better sense rising and falling currents of air and temperature changes etc. Grunau Baby III from the Wasserkuppe Museum at the 2009 Munich Oktoberfest It was designed by Edmund Schneider with the assistance of Wolf Hirth and Hugo Kromer as a smaller version of Schneider's ESG 31 of the previous year, incorporating an elliptical wing design based on work done by Akaflieg Darmstadt. It was named after Grunau, the town where Schneider's factory was located, now Jeżów Sudecki in Poland. The first 14 inner ribs were of the Göttingen 535 shape with the outer ribs gradually changing up to the last 22nd rib, having a bi- convex and symmetrical shape with a slight reduction in the angle of incidence. The tips and leading edges of the wings up to the main spar were covered with plywood. The tail unit was built of plywood. The intention was to create an aircraft suitable both for training and for cross-country soaring. Typical for its day, it was a high-wing braced monoplane with a fuselage of hexagonal cross-section and an open cockpit. The Baby was an instant success, and was enthusiastically promoted by gliding champion Wolf Hirth. An extensive redesign was undertaken in 1932 following the fatal crash of an unrelated Schneider design, which resulted in the Baby II. This version and the definitive Baby IIb that followed were adopted as standard sailplane trainers for the German Air Sports Association (later the National Socialist Flyers Corps). During 1941, 30 GB gliders were built by Laminação Nacional de Metais, later Companhia Aeronáutica Paulista in Brazil, under the name \\"Alcatraz\\". Following World War II, series production restarted in Germany in 1956. The Baby was also built in France (as the Nord 1300) and the United Kingdom (as the Elliotts Baby EoN and the Slingsby T5 - Slingsby also used it as the basis for a number of their own designs). Edmund Schneider emigrated to Australia, where he developed the Baby design into his Baby 3 and Baby 4, which had enclosed cockpits.

In contrast to the band's number-one hit from the movie, \\"The Power of Love\\", the lyrics for \\"Back in Time\\" specifically refer to the story and characters of the film. The song was later covered for the title sequence of the Back to the Future animated series, and appears in Back to the Future: The Game. This cover version of the track appears, as part of the animated series opening, in the sixth episode of the third series of multiple Emmy Award winning dystopian drama series Mr. Robot. Although not released as a commercially available single, the song, mixed by Bob Clearmountain, reached number three in September 1985 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. The video for the song contains bloopers and \\"never-before-seen\\" clips from the band's other hit videos, including \\"I Want a New Drug\\", \\"If This Is It\\", \\"Heart of Rock & Roll\\", and \\"Heart and Soul\\". It can also be heard in the critically lauded DC Comics film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, when the titular Titans travel back in time to alter the origin timelines for other famous DC heroes.

History =Building= The building that currently holds the Idaho Potato Museum was originally known as the Oregon Short Line Railroad Depot, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Rail Road. Construction of the building began in October 1912 and finished in August 15, 1913. For several years, a group of local residents involved in the potato industry discussed strategies to highlight the importance of potatoes to the local economy, and to showcase famous potato memorabilia. When Union Pacific Railway donated the Blackfoot railroad station depot building to Blackfoot City, the idea of turning the building into a potato museum was suggested and agreed upon. =Working group= The original potato museum working group comprised members of the Blackfoot potato industry and local officials. This group included: * Dean Yancey * Allan Larsen * Keith Hinckley * Brian Finnigan * Dean Hill * Walter Gay * Rex Call * Claude Johnson * Maureen Hill =Community debate= Some members of the local community lacked enthusiasm for the idea, and questioned, \\"Why would tourists travel to Idaho to visit a potato museum?\\" However, the working group was not deterred and continued to undertake promotional work within the Blackfoot community. In February 1988, the working group invited the director of the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody, Wyoming to speak at a public Chamber of Commerce meeting. He addressed the topic of specialized museums, imparting a message to Blackfoot that \\"sometimes we don't see the gold in our own backyard.\\" As support for the potato museum gained popularity amongst the community, the focus of the working group's discussions involved selecting a name for the museum. Many in the Blackfoot community felt that the term \\"museum\\" conjured up negative associations with \\"dusty, old relics\\". As the working group processed this feedback, they discussed strategies to ensure that the potato project appealed to a wide range of people; hence the moniker, the \\"Idaho's World Potato Exposition\\" was decided upon. =Trial opening= After many years of disuse and project obstacles, site was uninhabitable and had no restroom facilities. A \\"working-bee\\" was held to clean the building and prepare it for opening. A trial opening was held in the summer of 1988, which was attended by approximately 2000 people from the local and immediately surrounding areas. The trial, a success, did not contain any real displays and simply involved a series of divider-style signs with ideas written on them, describing what the planned displays would show. Consolidating upon the success of the launch, Maureen Hill volunteered to undertake the role of director (unpaid). Hill continued in the directorial role until 1989 when the expo was officially opened for tourists. In its first year of operation, the expo attracted 5000 visitors. =Material support= Material and financial donations were provided by: * The commercial potato industry (including companies: Basic American Foods and Nonpareil) * Local potato growers * The local community * The local county * The City of Blackfoot Management The potato expo has been managed by multiple potato boards. Nancy Batchelder, who served in the position for four years, was the first full-time paid director of the potato expo. Batchelder and Hill are credited with the success of the \\"free 'taters for out-of-staters\\" campaign. In 2002, Sandi Thomas was appointed director of the expo. At the time, the expo was experiencing severe financial hardship; however, Thomas was able to manage the expo's financial difficulties, ensuring the expo remained operational. In May 2002, Blackfoot Mayor Scott Reese approached the Blackfoot Chamber of Commerce executive director, Merlin Wright, with a proposal that involved the expo being managed and housed by the Chamber. After discussion, all the parties involved were amenable to the proposal, and staff moved into their offices in June 2002. The Idaho World Potato Exposition corporation was formally dissolved and new papers were drawn up and filed on September 17, 2002. The former expo is now legally known as the Potato Museum, Inc., trading under the name Idaho Potato Expo. Under the direction of the Chamber of Commerce, a new board of directors for the Potato Museum, Inc. was appointed. Deby Barrington was appointed president of the board, and Merlin Wright served as director for the Idaho Potato Museum, Inc. and Blackfoot Chamber of Commerce. In 2007, Merlin Wright resigned from both positions, and was replaced by Stephanie Govatos. Govatos served as the director for 4 years, before retiring to Florida with her family. The Museum Director as of 2012 is Tish Dahman. Exhibits Exhibit displays are donated from a combination of community and commercial sources. One of the most popular displays in the museum is the world’s largest potato crisp, donated by Pringles of Procter & Gamble. The museum’s exhibits include the world’s largest potato chip, measuring 25 and 14 inches big, and a timeline history of potato consumption in the US (including the introduction of fries to the White House menu selection during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson).“The Tater Temple,” Via Magazine, July 2000 Also on display are Peruvian-made 1,600-year-old vessels that are believed to be the first containers used specifically for potato storage.“Idaho Potato Museum” Idaho Adventures in Living A Hall of Fame acknowledging significant contributions to the potato industry is also an ongoing feature of the museum. Gift shop and cafe The Spud Seller gift shop is attached to the museum and offers merchandise with a potato or Idaho theme. The shop was initially a small enterprise that only sold items on consignment; however, in recent years, gift shop items have been purchased from multiple commercial wholesalers, representing a significant growth in the operation of the business. In 2016, the museum renovated the baggage claim area of the depot which was used for storage and opened the Potato Station Café. The café opened on Memorial Day weekend. The café serves baked potatoes, French fries and other potato-themed foods such as potato bread, potato cupcakes, and chocolate dipped potato chips.

Todorov reveal Greek influence, both official and unofficial. However the composition of the delegates who participated in that convention, represents Albanians, Turks, Greeks, and Vlachs as well as Slavic adherents of all political orientations, that is Bulgarian, Greek and Serbian. Between May 21 and June 2, in Gremen Teke, near Arnissa, Monastir Province, Ottoman Empire (now Macedonia (Greece), it held its first session. The Assembly was summoned to review the political situation of the country after the Berlin Congress and the indifference of the Great Powers to force the Ottoman Empire to implement the mandatory Article 23 from the Berlin Agreement, namely to give Macedonia a special autonomous status. On the agenda were the activities that need to be taken to achieve the “national cause”. The Assembly concluded that even after the latest big changes on the Balkans, when all other Christian nations gained national freedom and statehood: “Romania, Serbia and Montenegro gained a full independence, and Bulgaria, East Rumelia and Crete gained civil rights, it is only Macedonia, that had its own civilization from the most ancient times, was left without any help”. Than the National Assembly “unanimously decided to demand from the Ottoman state and Great powers swift implementation of the Article 23 of the Berlin Agreement for the Macedonian nation and for Macedonia”. National Assembly elected a Provisional Government of Macedonia, named “Unity” as an executive and operational body that will undertake all necessary activities to achieve the “national cause: creation of Macedonian state”. It was decided that they will first demand, using legal means, a right for autonomy, recognized by the Great powers and sanctioned by the international Berlin Agreement from 1878. If the Ottoman government denies the fulfillment of this obligation, and Great powers do not force it to fulfill it, “the Provisional Government will call the Macedonian nation to arms, under the banner: Macedonia for Macedonians, to restore the ancient Macedonia. In March 1881 the Provisional Government published a Manifest, with a protocol decision of the Macedonian National Assembly, to the diplomatic representatives of the Great powers. This manifest is mentioned by the Bulgarian Patriarch Kiril in the Book: Б’лгарската екзархија в Одринско и Македонија след Освободителната војна (1877–1878), vol. 1/1, Софиа: Синодално издателство, 1969, p. 461-466, 485.

The list included a number of people Tribe had met at Ars Electronica\\"Interview with Mark Tribe, Founder, Rhizome\\", Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, April 29, 2010. By August, Rhizome had launched its website, which by 1998 had developed a significant readership within the Internet art community.\\"Art Site Takes Plunge Into Not-for-Profitability\\" Originally designated a business, Rhizome became a nonprofit organization in 1998, switching to the domain-name suffix \\".org.\\". In an interview with Laurel Ptak for the Bard Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture Archive, Tribe explains \\"I thought of it as Artforum meets AltaVista (AltaVista was one of the first web search engines), as a kind of bottom-up alternative to the top-down hierarchies of the art world.\\" Rhizome established an online archive called the ArtBase in 1999.Electronic Arts Intermix (EAI) The ArtBase was initially conceived exclusively as a database of net art works. Today, the scope of the ArtBase has expanded to include other forms of art engaged with technology, including games, software, and interdisciplinary projects with online elements. The works are submitted by the artists themselves.Preserving the Rhizome Artbase In addition to hosting archived work, Rhizome's digital preservation work includes conservation of digital art and updating obsolete code.Digital Preservation Practices and the Rhizome ArtBase In 2003, Rhizome became affiliated with the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City.\\"New Museum Joins Forces with Artists' Web Site,\\" New York Times, Today, Rhizome's programs include events, exhibitions at the New Museum and elsewhere, an active website, and an archive of more than 2,000 new media artworks. The organization has published one book with Link Editions, \\"The Best of Rhizome 2012\\" edited by former editor Joanne McNeil. In 2015, the organization relaunched rhizome.org with a new design created by Wieden+Kennedy.  Digital Preservation Program  Rhizome operates a digital preservation program, led by Dragan Espenschied, which is focused on the creation of free, open source software tools to decentralize web archiving and software preservation practices and ensure continuing access to its collections of born-digital art. =ArtBase= Founded in 1999, the Rhizome ArtBase is an online archive of new media art containing some 2,110 art works. The ArtBase encompasses a vast range of projects by artists all over the world that employ materials including software, code, websites, moving image, games and browsers to aesthetic and critical ends. = Web archiving = In response to the needs of the ArtBase—as well as to the increasing number of artists creating works on social media platforms and as interactive websites—in 2014 Rhizome began a program to develop open source web archiving tools that could both serve its mission and a broader community of users. Rhizome launched the social media archiving tool Colloq in 2014, which works by replicating the interface of social media platforms. Amalia Ulman's instagram project \\"Excellences and Perfections\\" (2014) was the first social media artwork archived with Colloq. Colloq pays special attention to the way a user interacts with the social media interface at the time of creation, using a technique called \\"web capturing\\" to store website behaviors. The tool was developed by Ilya Kremer and Rhizome's Digital Conservator Dragan Espenscheid. In 2015, Rhizome unveiled its archive of the influential art blog VVORK, marking the first time Colloq was used to archive an entire website. Archiving VVORK allowed Rhizome to tackle the challenge of archiving embedded video content, which is often hosted on a third-party site. The website had been previously archived by Internet Archive,\\"VVORK on Archive.org\\" but this recording did not include embedded media like videos that Colloq was built to capture. Of the tool, Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said: it makes archives \\"as close as possible, you’re going to get the experience of interacting with the actual site.\\" In 2015, Rhizome folded the Colloq project into a more expansive Webrecorder initiative. In August 2016, the organization launched the public release of a more fully realized Webrecorder tool, which is a free web archiving tool that allows users to create their own archives of the dynamic web. Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Webrecorder is targeted towards archiving social media, video content, and other dynamic content, rather than static webpages. Webrecorder is an attempt to place web archiving tools in the hands of individual users and communities. It uses a \\"symmetrical web archiving\\" approach, meaning the same software is used to record and play back the website. While other web archiving tools run a web crawler to capture sites, Webrecorder takes a different method, actually recording a user browsing the site to capture its interactive features. = Oldweb.today = In December 2015, Rhizome launched oldweb.today, a project that allows users to view archived webpages within emulated versions of legacy web browsers. Users are given the option of browsing the site of their choice within versions of Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome. The project gives users a deeper understanding of web history and the way browsing environments alter one's experience of the internet. It is an example of \\"Emulation as a Service\\" technology, imitating old software programs so that they can run on new computers. Rhizome Commissions Program Founded in 2001 to support artists working with technology, the Rhizome Commissions Program has awarded more than 100 commissions as of 2016. In 2008, Rhizome expanded the scope of the commissions from strictly Internet-based art to the broad range of forms and practices that fall under the category of new media art. This includes projects that creatively engage new and networked technologies or reflect on the impact of these tools and media. With this expanded format, commissioned works can take the final form of online works, performance, video, installation or sound art. Projects can be made for the context of the gallery, the public, the web or networked devices. Among the artists awarded a Rhizome commission: Heba Amin, Aleksandra Domanović, Aram Bartholl, Knifeandfork (Brian House and Sue Huang), Mendi & Keith Obadike, Trevor Paglen, Jon Rafman, Tao Lin, Tristan Perich, Angelo Plessas. Brody Condon, Jona Bechtolt, Kristin Lucas, Evan Roth, Rafaël Rozendaal, eteam, Steve Lambert, Zach Lieberman, Porpentine (game designer). Exhibition Program In its two decades of activity, Rhizome has presented exhibitions online and in gallery spaces. =ArtBase 101= In 2005 at the New Museum, Rhizome presented this exhibition of 40 selections from its online archive of new media art, the ArtBase. Cocurated by then-director Lauren Cornell and former director Rachel Greene, the exhibition addressed dirt style, net cinema, games, e-commerce, data visualization and databases, online celebrity, public space, software, cyberfeminism, and early net.art. Selected artists included John F. Simon Jr., M. River and T. Whid Art Associates, 0100101110101101.org, Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries, and Cory Arcangel. Sarah Boxer, reviewing the exhibition for the New York Times called Artbase 101 \\"an ambitious and risky thing to do.\\" = New York New York Happy Happy (NY NY HP HP) = In 2013, the organization presented an experiential artwork by artist Ed Fornieles, which sent up art world and high society debauchery with \\"forced undressing,\\" eating salami slices from nude bodies, the exploitation of unpaid performance artists, and male strippers.\\"Hungry for Love, The New Inquiry\\"\\"NY NY Happy Happy An art event goes awry\\" Writing for Noisy, Zach Sokol said of the event: \\"Fornieles may be tinkering with the idea that we force imagined social archetypes and social spaces into existence... We all become sociopaths when there are beautiful people, fancy spaces, exclusivity, and of course documentation with iPhones, cameras, and video cameras.\\"Ate Salami Off a Naked Person and Acted Like a Sociopath at a Fake Gala\\" = Net Art Anthology = In October 2016, Rhizome launched Net Art Anthology, a two-year online exhibition devoted to restaging 100 key artworks from the history of net art. One project per week will be restaged and conceptualized through an online exhibition page. Devised in tandem with Rhizome's digital conservation department, Net Art Anthology makes use of the tools Rhizome has developed for preserving dynamic web-based artworks. The project was launched with an artists' panel at the New Museum on October 27, 2016, featuring Olia Lialina, Martha Wilson, Mark Tribe, and Ricardo Dominguez. Seven on Seven Since 2010, Rhizome has held an annual conference at the New Museum pairing leading technologists and contemporary artists to create something new—art, apps, often arguments about digital culture. The program has led to many influential projects such as a start-up called Monegraph; a short documentary film for the New York Times by Laura Poitras; and artworks later shown at major art institutions, like Image Atlas by Taryn Simon and Aaron Swartz. Artists that have participated in Seven on Seven: Evan Roth, Aaron Koblin, Monica Narula, Ryan Trecartin, Tauba Auerbach, Marc Andre Robinson, Kristin Lucas, Michael Bell-Smith, Ricardo Cabello (mr.doob), Liz Magic Laser, Zach Lieberman, Rashaad Newsome, Ryder Ripps, Camille Utterback, Emily Royston, Aram Bartholl, Xavier Cha, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Naeem Mohaiemen, Jon Rafman, Taryn Simon and Stephanie Syjuco.

The 267-lap race on the track was held on November 16 at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead, Florida.

The company also offers cloud-based/on-prem storage, virtual data rooms and client portals. ShareFile is owned by Citrix Systems. History =Early history= Jesse Lipson, a self-taught programmer, built and launched ShareFile in November 2005 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Lipson created ShareFile after several of his website design clients asked him to build a password-protected area where they could set up folders and exchange business files with their clients. He felt FTP sites of the time were insufficient and saw an opportunity to create a web-based product. ShareFile launched without a free version or outside funding, and focused on acquiring only business customers. By 2011, ShareFile had 3 million users in 100 countries. ShareFile was included on the Inc. 500 list of Fastest Growing Private Companies in both 2010 and 2011. =Acquisition by Citrix Systems= In October 2011, ShareFile was acquired by Citrix Systems. Under terms of the agreement, ShareFile was offered as a standalone service in addition to its software becoming integrated into Citrix products. With the acquisition, Lipson became vice president and general manager of a new data sharing division within Citrix under the deal. As of 2016, Lipson is corporate vice president and general manager of cloud services, which includes ShareFile and Citrix Workspace Cloud. A new 171,000-square-foot Raleigh office opened in October 2014 for Raleigh-based Citrix employees. As of April 2015, ShareFile had 55,000 corporate customers and 40 million users. Product overview ShareFile is a secure, cloud-based platform for businesses to store and share large files. Businesses are able to create branded, password-protected areas for files through the service. The software has a client-portal feature businesses can set up and customize to allow outside vendors and clients access to specific projects and files. Other ShareFile features include the ability to send and obtain e-signatures on documents with the integration of RightSignature; the ability to send encrypted email through a Microsoft Outlook plugin or an online portal, Office 365 connection to access and edit documents stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business; and the ability for individuals to migrate data from their personal clouds into ShareFile. There are also mobile app versions of ShareFile, which allow mobile editing and offline editing of documents. =Security features= ShareFile users have the option to store data in their own data centers, Citrix-managed data centers, or use existing file storage systems via StorageZone Connectors. This allows companies to host files that they do not want stored in the cloud, in some cases due to regulatory concerns. IT managers can manage corporate content on ShareFile using remote wipe, encryption, passcode lock and poison pill features. In addition, companies are able to restrict third-party editing tools that employees might try to install on their devices, and audit content accessed from a device that has been lost or stolen. =Industry-specific features= In response to updated regulations with HIPAA standards, Citrix created ShareFile Cloud for Health Care in 2013. This private virtual cloud was designed to help companies stay compliant with updated HIPAA standards. It runs on the AWS Cloud, but sets aside specific virtual servers to host protected health information (PHI). Also in 2013, ShareFile began offering a feature called \\"Archiving for Financial Services\\" to help organizations in the financial sector comply with data archiving regulations put forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

It lasted until 1852. Background Prior to 1801, Congregationalists and Presbyterians had enjoyed friendly relationships. Both denominations shared a common Calvinistic theology, while differing in church polity (with Congregationalists and Presbyterians having adopted the Savoy Declaration and Westminster Standards respectively). There were also many instances stretching back to colonial times where Puritan congregations embraced presbyterian polity. Provisions The Plan of Union was initially agreed upon between the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church and the Connecticut General Association of Congregational Churches. The Plan was later approved by the Congregational associations in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. It enabled churches of either denomination to hire ministers from the other. Congregations were given the choice whether to be governed by congregational polity or by the Presbyterian model of a session of ruling elders. The Plan also made it possible for the Middle Association of Congregationalists in New York to become a subordinate jurisdiction of the Presbyterian Synod of Albany. As part of the Plan, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church designated the Congregationalist American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as its recognized missions agency in 1826. By 1831, the majority of board members and missionaries of the ABCFM were Presbyterians. As a result, most of the local churches established by the organization during this period were Presbyterian. Congregationalists essentially \\"turned over domestic evangelistic efforts to Presbyterians\\". Termination A consequence of this arrangement was that the Presbyterian Church received an influx of pastors and congregations sympathetic to the New England theology that prevailed within the Congregational churches. This ultimately led to the Old School-New School Controversy that divided the Presbyterian Church in 1837. The Old School Presbyterian Church ended cooperation with the Congregationalists in 1837, but the New School Presbyterian Church would remain in union with the Congregational churches until 1852. That year the Congregationalists ended their participation in the Plan of Union. By this time, Congregationalists had developed a greater denominational consciousness, which ultimately led to the creation of the National Council of the Congregational Churches in 1865.

The Eastern Idaho State Fair is an American state fair held annually the first week of September in Blackfoot, Idaho. It is one of three annual state fairs in Idaho; the others being the Western Idaho Fair, which is held in Boise, the state capital, and the Northern Idaho State fair, held in Coeur d’Alene. The gates to the fairgrounds open on Labor Day weekend, the first week in September. History In 1902 some cattle ranchers had purchased some land in hopes of putting on a livestock show. The show was given the name \\"Southeastern Idaho Fair\\". When financial hardships hit the fair in 1918, it was suspended until 1920. The state legislators passed a Fair District Bill in 1925. The fair started out as a district fair with livestock and entertainment. After being challenged by the Utah State Fair, the officials decided to change the name of the event from \\"Eastern Idaho Fair\\" to \\"Eastern Idaho State Fair\\". In 1925, the fair ran for four days. The fair was shut down in July 1942, after the United States entered World War II, and the buildings at the fairground were used for storage of surplus. On December 10, a fire destroyed the commercial buildings consuming potatoes and coal. In 1942, the Fair housed some 500 Italian prisoners, who were ordered to dig sugar beets and potatoes. Operations have continued since 1944. The Native Americans of Fort Hall have also influenced the Eastern Idaho State Fair: an Indian Relay Race has been held throughout the fair's history. The state fair has been used to promote local agriculture throughout its history, with area farmers displaying their produce and livestock to the public. 2017 marked the 115 year anniversary for the fair. It set an attendance record of 239,103 which broke the previous record set in 2016. In 2020, officials will only have the fair food fix, livestock show & rodeo available as others have been cancelled caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will be shortened to 4 days. Opening day One of the events held at the opening of the fair is the annual parade held in Blackfoot. The parade starts at the south end of Shilling Avenue and makes its way to the north end. Several local clubs and organizations, as well as representatives from local high schools, police department, fire department, businesses and dance teams, participate in the line of the parade. The parade is escorted by the local police department and fire department, sounding their horns and sirens. Local high schools, cheerleading squads, student council, Junior Miss winners, dance team and some clubs have their own floats. The people on these floats cheer, throw candy, and promote the fair. Businesses around town are in the parade with music, candy, and brochures advertising their business. The dance teams advertise their team, but and entertain the crowd by doing a dance while walking down the road. Attractions Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, American, and Indian food is sold at the fair, including teriyaki bowls, tiger ears, scone nuggets, turkey legs, hamburgers, funnel cakes, curly fries, ice cream, and Dutch oven cooking. A famous meal at the fair is the \\"ice cream potato\\" which consists of ice cream dressed up to look like a baked potato with cheddar cheese, bacon, and sour cream as toppings. Weekdays at the grandstands, horse races are held from noon until about late afternoon. After every few heats, the Indian relays are held. The Native American tribes have three horses each, which are taken for three laps around the track. In order to use every horse each tribe has to do a switch after taking one lap, and the man on the horse does not wait until the horse is at a dead halt. The participants in the race jump off the horse while horse is slowing down, then run and jump onto the next horse. Those who fail to jump correctly get far behind the other teams. The horses from which they jump are sometimes unable to slow down in time, and trample the rider. Many people participate in gambling on the race. Night time events include motocross, bull riding, rodeo, tractor pulls, concerts, and a demolition derby.# Headliners. Eastern Idaho State Fair. IE Productions. 20 Feb 2008. The concerts change every year, with different genres and performers. The 2015 edition of the fair features Gabriel Iglesias and Cheap Trick as headline performers. On two other small stages, smaller events take place. Some of the smaller events include hypnotists, arm wrestling contests, \\"Idaho Idol\\" (sponsored by KFTZ \\"Z-103.FM\\"), local dance teams, singing, and comedy shows. Other events surrounding the stage include a petting zoo, camp trailers, and a reptile show. Fairground rides and games are operated at the show, including child rides and adult rides, including the Zipper, Fun Slide, House of Mirrors, and trucks that go around on a track. Tickets and wristbands are sold to the rides and the games. The rides are provided by Butler Amusements. Animals displayed at the fair include dairy and beef cattle, different types and breeds of horses, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, rabbits, and ostriches. The public is allowed to showcase their livestock for the 4H program. Buildings on the fairgrounds include agricultural information, advertising of hot tubs, trailers, fireplaces, siding for houses, and others. The smaller buildings may contain craft items. Blankets, handmade clothes, and other stitching work is displayed, along with photography of animals, nature, children, weddings, families, senior pictures, and other subjects.

His belief was that a child should be encouraged to learn through experience, and to development in feelings as well as intellect. His work provided the model for infant schools in Europe and North America. Samuel Wilderspin, 1848 engraving after John Rogers Herbert Life Wilderspin was born an only child in the district of Hornsey, London. Born into a Christian home, Wilderspin claimed he acknowledged the existence of a superior being \\"a Maker, a Governor, and Protector of this world\\", not because of his parents but due to his own observation and intuition. Wilderspin was homeschooled most of his childhood, as he claimed his parents taught him everything and gave him a foundation he truly appreciates though he also claimed to have \\"thrown much on my resources, early became a thinker, and contriver too\\". At the age of seven, his parents encouraged him to attend the public school system of education, subsequently encouraging him to withdraw. Wilderspin was destined for business, however a series of events led him to teaching and furthermore initiating a system of teaching. (The Infant System - Samuel Wilderspin). Wilderspin was apprenticed as a clerk in the City of London, but later trained in infant education. Through a New Jerusalem Church in south London, he met James Buchanan, an Owenite who had recently set up an infant school at Brewer's Green in Westminster. With his wife Sarah Anne, Wilderspin ran an infant school in Spitalfields, London, from 1820. This school particularly impressed David Stow, who invited Wilderspin to Glasgow to lecture on it. Wilderspin published On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor in 1823, based on his experiences in Spitalfields. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views on education. It folded in 1828, but Wilderspin continued to propagate his views nationally. Views The ideas current at this time on infant education went back to J. F. Oberlin and Robert Owen. Wilderspin's approach to schooling as necessary for a socially and morally prepared child was informed by his Swedenborgianism. When posed with the question \\"how came you to think of the Infant School Teaching System?\\" Wilderspin would simply respond \\"circumstances forced me to it\\". Wilderspin claimed that existing infant schools were \\"simply dame-schools, with the hornbook for boys and girls, and perhaps a little sewing for the latter\\" (The Infant System - Wilderspin). Wilderspin believed that the first seven years of a child are his/her golden years - these are the most important years of a child to build a foundation, and vehemently admonished parents and teachers likewise to appeal to their senses. Wilderspin developed four (4) rules in teaching infants: First - to feed the child's faculties with suitable food. Second - to simplify and explain everything, so as to adapt it properly to those faculties. Third - not to overdo anything, either by giving too much instruction, or instruction beyond their years, and thus over-excite the brain, and injure the faculties. Fourth - blend both exercise and amusement with instruction at due intervals, which is readily effected by a moderate amount of singing, alternating with the usual motions and evolutions in the schoolroom, and the unfettered freedom of the play-ground. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education, and he is credited with the invention of the playground. He also ran a company supplying apparatus for playground activities. Works Wilderspin wrote: *On the Importance of educating the Infant Poor, 2nd ed. London, 1824; a third edition appeared in 1825 as Infant Education. *Early Discipline illustrated, London, 1832; 3rd ed. 1840. *A System for the Education for the Young, London, 1840. *A Manual for the Instruction of Young Children (with Thomas John Terrington), London and Hull, 1845. *The Infant System for Developing, &c.; (in this he calls himself \\"inventor of the system of infant training\\"), 8th ed. London, 1852. Samuel Wilderspin wrote \\"The Infant System,for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers off all children from 1 to seven years of age\\". Legacy Around two thousand (2000) schools were founded by Wilderspin throughout the United Kingdom (Report from the Select Committee of Education in England and Wales, P.P. (1835) VII p13). However, Queen Street School in Barton-upon- Humber is the only known surviving school built to his designs. It was completed in 1845, and Wilderspin himself taught at the school for several years before retiring in 1848. His papers are in Senate House Library, University of London.

The current Ambassador to Russia is Haidar Hadi who has been serving in Russia since December 2016. History Relations between Russians and the people of Iraq long predate the formation of the modern Iraqi and Russian states. In the Middle Ages, merchants and explorers travelled between the two countries using the Volga trade route and Caspian Sea, and then overland. According to ibn Khordadbeh, already in the 9th century one could encounter Rus merchants in the markets of Baghdad, to which they brought beaver, fox pelts, and swords.\\"Rus.\\", in Encyclopaedia of Islam (Brill Online). Eds.: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill.Encyclopaedia of IslamBrøndsted, Johannes (1965). The Vikings. (transl. by Kalle Skov). Penguin Books. pp. 64–65 In the modern era, Soviet-Iraqi and, later, Russian- Iraqi relations have been generally part and parcel of their relations with the Third World countries and their national liberation movements, particularly Arab nationalism, which for both historical and geostrategic reasons has been especially important for Moscow. However, at the same time, particularly between 1958 and 1990, Soviet-Iraqi relations were marked by some special features, putting them in contrast with Soviet links with other Afro- Asian nations and even some states of the Arab Middle East. * Iraq was, first of all, the closest of all the Arab nations to Soviet borders and, because of that proximity the threat of Soviet expansion, could have been seen as being much more realistic and likely by its leaders, as compared with the leaders of the other Arab states. * Although different from the other Arab states of the Mashreq, Iraq, since its very beginning in the 1920s, contained a substantial (close to twenty-five percent) ethnic non-Arab Kurdish minority with specific constitutional rights, which were granted in 1925 as a condition for the incorporation of the largely Kurdish populated Mosul region into its borders. The Kurdish people, other groups of which live in Turkey, Iran and Russia, have never completely submitted to their division and lack of national self- determination, and have constantly demanded territorial autonomy in Iraq since 1961. Their aspirations towards which the Soviet Union could not remain indifferent, were, however, putting the nation in the awkward situation of having to make a choice between their recognition and general support of Arab nationalism and the friendly Iraqi government. * The Iraqi Communist Party, which was formally founded in 1934, was one of the most effective and socially influential Marxist organizations in the region. Although it was never powerful enough to seize power by itself, it nevertheless represented a by-no- means negligible political force in the country, supporting Moscow after 1958, both a valuable asset and an embarrassment in its deals with the \\"progressive\\" but still often viciously anti-communist Iraqi government. * Finally, Iraq's economic potential and relative wealth, especially after the 1973 October War and the subsequent and substantial rise of oil prices, made the state a financially attractive partner and customer for Moscow. These economic aspects, which had never been absent in the past, have acquired additional importance since the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of Russia as a separate and pro-capitalist nation. *Within two years, Russian-Iraqi trade increased by 52 percent from $900 million to $1.4 billion as per September 2018. Post-Soviet Russia, although having rejected Marxist ideology and the ideological support of the Communist parties and the national liberation movements of Third World peoples, is nevertheless still interested in cooperation with Iraq, and has supported Baghdad politically against the United States since 1994, including the imposing of punitive sanctions. =Iraq–Soviet Union relations= The Soviet Union officially established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Iraq on 9 September 1944. The regime of King Faisal II was anti-communist, and established links with Moscow due its dependence on the United Kingdom and the Anglo–Soviet Treaty of 1942. In January 1955, the Soviet government criticised the Iraqi government decision to join the Baghdad Pact, which led to capitalist Iraq cutting diplomatic relations with the Soviets. After Faisal II was overthrown in a military coup on 14 July 1958, the newly proclaimed Republic of Iraq led by General Abd al- Karim Qasim re-established relations with the Soviet Union in March 1959, and the Soviet Union began selling arms to Baghdad. In November 1958, Soviet Union sent a military mission to Iraq as well as MiG-17 and Il-38 aircraft. After the 1963 Iraqi coup d'etat, the new government persecuted communists, and Soviet Union temporarily suspended arms exports till June 1964. The Soviet Union provided significant military hardware to Iraq, such as military aircraft (including MiG fighter jets), tanks, and a surface-to-air missile system), as well as aid in the former of Soviet military and civilian advisers who provided technical assistance.\\"Russia / Soviet Union\\" in Historical Dictionary of Iraq (eds. Beth K. Dougherty & Edmund A. Ghareeb: 2d ed: Scarecrow Press, 2013), pp. 508-09. In 1967, Iraq signed an agreement with the USSR to supply the nation with oil in exchange for large-scale access to Eastern Bloc arms. The Baathist regime \\"drew even closer to the Soviet Union, with relations hitting their peak from 1969 to 1973.\\" After 1972, Iraq soon became one of the Soviet Union's closest allies in the Middle East. A fifteen- year Iraqi-Soviet \\"treaty of friendship and cooperation\\" was signed in April 1972. Iraq participated in the Yom Kippur War against Israel, and received Soviet military aid during the war. Soviets assisted the Iraqis in the development of the Rumaila oil field, and Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Soviet arms were also used by the Iraqis to crush the Kurdish uprising led by Mustafa Barzani, in 1975. Iraqi secret police received training from Soviet and East German agents. Ties between the two nations \\"weakened in the mid-1970s as Baghdad sought to mend fences with its Gulf neighbors and get access to Western technology.\\" Moreover, Iraq's government did not share good relations with Syria, a close partner of Soviet Union and tried to improve relations with Egypt, which was moving out of the Soviet sphere of influence. In the Iran–Iraq War, Soviet Union accounted for 32% of the arms imports of Iraq, the greatest for any country. In absolute terms, this was more than 20 billion dollars. During the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq diversified its arms sales by purchasing arms from France, China, Brazil, South Africa and the United States. Iraq sought to ensure that it could fulfill its military needs while avoiding over-reliance on the Soviet Union. This did not mean that during all that time their mutual relations had always been equally friendly and without serious political differences. Canadian scholar Andrej Kreutz explains because of their support of the national-liberation movements, a number of important Third World countries, including Iraq, \\"declared their friendship for and improved relations with the USSR and sided with it on a number of international problems\\". In no instance, however, did their leaders \\"compromise their own national interests or become Soviet stooges.\\" Baghdad's interest in cooperation with Moscow \\"was based on the need for a powerful patron in its efforts to shed all the remnants of Western colonialism and to establish Iraq as an autonomous member of the world order of nation states.\\" At the same time, however, the Iraqi \\"ruling elite had shown stubborn resistance towards anything which could be regarded as an intrusion into the country's internal affairs or as an infringement upon Iraq's sovereignty over its international policies.\\" Iraqi occupation of Kuwait The Soviet Union was critical of Saddam Hussein's 2 August 1990 occupation of Kuwait, and supported a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of military force, if necessary, to enforce an arms embargo against Iraq. But the Soviet Union's military support for Hussein also drew substantial criticism from the United States and other Western countries. In Washington, D.C., Heritage Foundation foreign policy experts Jay P. Kosminsky and Michael Johns wrote on 30 August 1990 that, \\"While condemning the Iraqi invasion, Gorbachev continues to assist Saddam militarily. By Moscow's own admission, in a 22 August official press conference with Red Army Colonel Valentin Ogurtsov, 193 Soviet military advisors still are training and assisting Iraq's one million-man armed forces. Privately, Pentagon sources say that between 3,000 and 4,000 Soviet military advisors may be in Iraq.\\" Present Before and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Russian government provided intelligence to Saddam Hussein about the location of US forces and their plans. In 2018, Iraq received T-90 tanks from Russia. In 2020, Iraq is reportedly considering the purchase of S-400 missile system from Russia.

Background Sam Dillemans was born in Leuven, Flemish Brabant, Flanders, Belgium. After high school, Dillemans studied at several academies in Belgium and abroad. He obtained the French Higher National diploma of Plastic Expression Option Art. For some years he has been teaching drawing and painting at the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp and was a guest professor at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts of Flanders, also in Antwerp. He now lives and works in Borgerhout, Antwerp. A documentary about his work and life, The Madness of Detail, was entered in the \\"Creative Documentary\\" category at the 21st International Festival of Audiovisual Programmes held in Biarritz, France in January 2008. and won the FIPA d'Or for best creative documentary. Work The work of Dillemans has deep roots in European painting tradition. According to Dillemans, painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Peter Paul Rubens, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and Pablo Picasso are not artists of the past, but artists of today and they continue inspire him in his work. To Dillemans it does not matter when something was painted, but how it was painted. The method of painting, how paint and brushes are used to seek or construct a striking image, is timeless. His work is a quest to find the visual equivalent for the complex interaction between imagination, feeling, consciousness and the painting technique itself. To achieve this goal, Dillemans says, painters have a difficult and at times tedious task to fulfill. They cannot not be satisfied with the clear perception of reality as an evidence of truth, but must try harder to understand more fully their subjects. With thick strokes and an impressive relief on the surface, Dillemans's style contains a refined form of elasticity and plasticity. The process of creation is an important aspect in his work. During this process the paintings appear at times to become gradually more abstract. Dillemans is convinced that a painting only has a chance to take form once the paint begins to take on a life of its own. This style is more firmly rooted in the European tradition rather than that of abstract expressionism and although the strokes become autonomous and follow their own logic, the final form stills holds true to a recognizable and even classical form. Modernism, classicism and academism seem to come together in his work without any contradiction among the styles. World vision  Dillemans's world vision is rather sombre. He works intensively and there is much action and movement within his work and in this way his painting becomes an intense occupation. Many painters of the past were also occupied by this same endeavour. Dillemans states that, \\"a painter like Ingres drew on his right to be taken seriously. In his case it is about a beautiful aristocratic seriousness which has nothing to do with self glorification. Proof of this is that he was still copying Michelangelo at the age of sixty five.\\" Stages Because of his prolific work and creativity, Dillemans's output has already passed through several different stages. During the period from 1993 to 2000, he did an intensive study of the female portrait, at times using his wife as a model. A second period from 2000 to 2003 was a period of reflection during which he studied the old masters. This phase would also influence his later work. From 2003 onward he began a pugilistic painting project with numerous boxing scenes in which a rhythmical movement between individual figures and the presence of physical bodies are in constant dialogue with the baroque. He also began a series of portraits of well known figures who he admires including Ingres and the Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx. Trivia * In De Kus, a Belgian film drama by Hilde Van Mieghem, some of his paintings and drawings are shown in the background representing works created by one of the characters in the film. * Belgian singer Axelle Red used an image of \\"Lovers\\", a painting by Sam Dillemans as a cover for her album Sisters & Empathy. According to her the painting symbolises a masculine kind of sexuality which remains respectful toward the female body.

Publishing history The original sequence of novellas was published as follows: # \\"Tros of Samothrace\\", 10 February 1925 (later became chapters 1..14 of the novel) # \\"The Enemy of Rome\\", 10 April 1925 (chapters 15..26) # \\"Prisoners of War\\", 10 June 1925 (chapters 27..37) # \\"Hostages to Luck\\", 20 August 1925 (chapters 38..51) # \\"Admiral of Caesar's Fleet\\", 10 October 1925 (chapters 52..66) # \\"The Dancing Girl of Gades\\", 10 December 1925 (chapters 67..81) # \\"Messenger of Destiny\\", part 1, 10 February 1926 (chapters 82..87) # \\"Messenger of Destiny\\", part 2, 20 February 1926 (chapters 88..92) # \\"Messenger of Destiny\\", part 3, 28 February 1926 (chapters 93..96) Brian Taves, Talbot Mundy, Philosopher of Adventure, McFarland, 2006 (pg. 288). When Tros of Samothrace was published as four paperback volumes during 1967 and 1971, the divisions between volumes coincided with Mundy's own divisions: *Tros contains \\"Tros of Samothrace\\" and \\"The Enemy of Rome\\". *Helma contains \\"Prisoners of War\\" and \\"Hostages to Luck\\". *Liafail contains \\"Admiral of Caesar's Fleet\\" and \\"The Dancing Girl of Gades\\". *Helene contains all three parts of \\"Messenger of Destiny\\". When Tros of Samothrace was reissued as three paperback volumes during 1976, the divisions between volumes was partway through \\"Prisoners of War\\" and \\"Admiral of Caesar's Fleet\\". Reception Although the stories were popular with Adventure's readers, they also aroused debate due to the fact that Mundy described Julius Caesar and Roman civilization as imperialistic and tyrannical; Adventure editor Arthur Sullivant Hoffman later stated that the Tros stories were the most controversial the magazine had ever published.Donald M. Grant, Talbot Mundy: Messenger of Destiny. Donald M. Grant publishers, 1983. (p. 152). Mundy's negative depiction of Caesar resulted in controversy in Adventure's letters section, \\"the Camp-Fire\\".Lee Server, Danger is my business: an illustrated history of the Fabulous Pulp Magazines. Chronicle Books, 1993. (pp. 55-6) Fritz Leiber praised Tros of Samothrace, saying: \\"The Tros stories made a great impression on me as a young man. I read and re-read them...it was wonderful, imaginative writing\\". Floyd C. Gale wrote during 1959 when reviewing a new edition of the book that it was \\"Out of print far too long, here is one classic that still reads as if written yesterday ... An absolute Must Buy at this price\\". Picture of dust-cover by Lionel Dillon from the Gnome Press reprint.

The film is approximately two and a half minutes long. It employs dream-like imagery, with stationary visuals which show a theater and the screen on which nightmarish images are projected. The film is part of the To Each His Own Cinema anthology. Lynch re-released the film on his YouTube channel in 2020.  Synopsis  Four people (never seen, but heard) enter a theater, expecting to see a film about dancing, but only see a large pair of scissors sticking out of the screen. They are then shown images of a woman in a pink dress and ballet shoes, who the group identifies as one of them, Cindy, and a man with a bloody face, who the group identifies as another of them, Tom. The projectionist explains that the scissors are \\"what was used\\" and that Tom is \\"the one who did it\\". Tom denies that he is the one on screen. The scissors reappear in a stabbing motion as Cindy becomes distressed by the way Tom is looking at her. A commotion and Cindy's screams then accompany the theater being engulfed in smoke as the others shout at Tom to \\"stop\\". Cindy then reappears on the screen, dancing ballet, as her voice says \\"So, I went dancing.

Career Grebner is a resident of East Lansing, Michigan. He enrolled at Michigan State University as an Alumni Distinguished Scholar in 1970, completing a bachelor's degree in urban policy through MSU's James Madison College in 1981. He earned a juris doctorate from the University of Michigan Law School. He became active in voter registration efforts in East Lansing in 1971 following the ratification of the U.S. Constitution's 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. He was an elected Ingham County Commissioner from 1977 to 2012, except 1981–84, and was selected by board colleagues as Chairperson of the Board of Commissioners in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2011.Ingham County Board of Commissioners web site Grebner's work as Ingham County Commissioner included drafting a comprehensive county ethics policy and support for public transit initiatives. A Democrat, he represented a district on the Board of Commissioners that included a substantial portion of the MSU campus. In 2012, instead of running for re-election to the county board, Grebner challenged incumbent Ingham County Drain Commissioner Patrick E. Lindemann, alleging fiscal mismanagement and cronyism, while Lindemann touted environmental protection and cost-savings. Lindemann defeated Grebner in the primary election and won re-election in the November general election. In 2016, Grebner again ran for Ingham County Commissioner, this time as a resident of district 8, including precincts on the western edge of East Lansing. He was elected to a two-year term with 70 percent of the vote. Grebner is the president of Practical Political Consulting, a voter list and consulting firm which works mostly for Democrats in Michigan. In 1999, the firm expanded its operations to include Wisconsin.Grebner Masters the Art of the List, Lansing Business Monthly, February 2008 In an article about local and national campaign consultants in the early years of electronic data science, The Wall Street Journal described the work necessary to transform raw voter data into a mailing label targeted to specific voters: \\"Mr. Grebner painstakingly gathers lists of local voters from hundreds of Michigan township and municipal clerks, many of whom don't have computers and keep only hard-copy records. He enters the names in his battery of desktop computers, then matches them to addresses and other data.\\" Beginning in 2004, his firm conducted a large-scale experiment, called ETOV, to \\"shame\\" nonvoters into participating in elections.Analyst plans to publicize voting records, Lansing State Journal, August 3, 2004Attention: This man is watching you, Lansing City Pulse, August 1, 2006 The results of the research were published in multiple academic peer- reviewed journals, including American Political Science Review.\\"Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large scale Field Experiment\\", American Political Science Review, February 2008 The journal Political Behavior described the origins of the experiment: \\"Mark Grebner, a political consultant in search of a cost effective way to increase voter turnout, developed a form of direct mail with information about whether they and their neighbors voted in recent elections. Grebner's intuition was that nonvoters are ashamed of abstaining but believe they can get away with it because no one knows whether in fact they voted.\\" The effects of this study communicating voter history to neighbors, in research conducted in partnership with Yale University, was determined to be three times more effective at increasing voter turnout from other get-out-the-vote mailings.

He rose to the rank of captain but was later tried at a court-martial for his conduct during the Action of August 1702, and being convicted of cowardice and disobedience was executed by firing squad. Family and early years Kirkby was born the fourth child and second son of Richard Kirkby, a justice of the peace and Member of Parliament for Lancaster, and his second wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir William Hudleston of Cumberland. He joined the Royal Navy and passed his naval lieutenant's examination on 28 March 1689. He was then appointed as second lieutenant of HMS Advice. He had powerful relatives, including Arthur Herbert and Sir John Lowther, the latter being one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. They secured him a promotion to captain on 12 February 1690, with his first appointment being to the hired ship HMS Success. He was sent as part of the fleet to capture St Kitts, returning to England in April 1692. Continued service Kirkby spent the fourteen months after his return without a ship to command, but was finally appointed to HMS Southampton in 1694 and served in the Mediterranean under the command of Edward Russell. The first signs of his aversion to fighting were noticeable in an engagement against two French vessels (the Content and the Trident) on 18–19 January 1695 off Pantelleria. It was noticed that he: > ‘kept as far off’ the heavily armed Content ‘as his guns could reach > reasonably firing now and then 2 or 3 guns at him’TNA: ADM 51/3935 pt 1 He was consequently excluded from a share in the resulting prize money. Further problems were also apparent aboard the Southampton. Her chaplain, Ellis Cooper, left the ship after some unrecorded unpleasantness with Kirkby. Further punishments were meted out, the boatswain was broken and flogged for disobedience and insolence, and a seaman was sentenced to be flogged and ‘towed ashore’ for ‘scandalous actions’. The Southampton, still with Kirkby in command, was then sent to the West Indies in 1696, being present at the burning of Petit-Goâve on 28 June 1697. Kirkby returned to England in 1698, where he was tried by court martial on charges of embezzlement and cruelty, accused of punishing a seaman for straggling by ordering him to be ‘tied up by the right arm and left leg for several hours’TNA: ADM 1/5260 The board cleared him, but Kirkby did not receive another command and spent the next two years without a ship and on half pay. Kirkby blamed this on ‘the great power and interest of my Lord of Orford’ (Edward Russell).TNA: ADM 1/2004 The West Indies, mutiny and court-martial Lowther was probably responsible for securing his return to active service, after Kirkby had written a number of letters pointing out this perceived injustice: > And since their said Lordships have supplied the said ships with officers > without respect to seniority or circumstance, there not being nine of the > thirty one that are elder in command than I, and the rest being my junior > officers, have most of them, if not all been paid off a considerable time, > since the ship I lately commanded was discharged. Therefore My Lords, I > humbly request in consideration of my service in command, between nine and > ten years, in all which time I have not proved guilty of any miscarriage to > the detriment of his Majesty's service, but have on the contrary been > especially instrumental in several actions in the late war contributing to > his Majesty’s and Country’s service, that your Lordships will please to > allow my title to seniority, that I may be no longer oppressed by the > advancement of my juniors to my prejudice. In February 1701 Kirkby was appointed to command HMS Ruby in the West Indies. He moved to HMS Defiance in March that year, and was second in command of Vice-admiral John Benbow's squadron which carried out a five day long skirmish with a French squadron off St Mary under Jean du Casse, an action later known as the Action of August 1702. Kirkby refused to obey Benbow's orders to close and engage the French, leaving only Benbow and two other ships to face the French alone. The English were eventually beaten off, Benbow being mortally wounded in the process. Kirkby personally came aboard Benbow's flagship, HMS Breda, to dissuade him from continuing the action. He went as far as to draft a letter, signed by the other captains, calling for Benbow to abandon the action. The English returned to Port Royal, Jamaica. On their return, Benbow had Kirkby and the other captains arrested for cowardice and disobedience, and tried them by court-martial. Over two dozen officers testified against him, stating that he had not encouraged his men to fight, but dodged behind the mizzenmast \\"falling down on the deck at the sound of a shot\\". The trial found Kirkby and another captain guilty of cowardice and disobedience and sentenced them to death. Kirkby wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, Josiah Burchett, claiming that the defeat had instead been caused by Benbow's injudicious and ignorant conduct. He accused Benbow of falsifying his evidence and threatening those who wanted to defend Kirkby. He also alleged that the court had been adjourned so that he could not present evidence in his defence. The Admiralty did not agree, and after Queen Anne had declined to intervene in the sentences, Kirkby and Captain Cooper Wade were transported to England by Captain Edward Acton.J. K.

Kirkby was described as \\"very calm and easy, not railing or reviling, but forgiving all the world and praying, for the Queen's health and prosperity\\".TNA: ADM 1/1436 He had written his own account of his actions, and drew up his will, leaving everything to his sister Elizabeth. The execution was to be carried out aboard HMS Bristol, in the presence of assembled officers. The execution took place at 6 pm. Kirkby was \\"kneeling on the larboard side of the forecastle\\" facing the six musketeers appointed to shoot him. He lifted his hand as \\"a signal to be shot\\". He was then taken to shore and buried under the communion table in Charles' Church, Plymouth.TNA: ADM 52/7 journal 8 References * Richard Kirkby's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography * Sources as used by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and other accounts (TNA standing for The National Archives, PRO the Public Record Office): ** Paybook of Advice, TNA: PRO, ADM 33/139 ** Lt.

The album was polled in 1998 as the 80th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav rock and pop albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music). Background and recording Although the band's guitarist Momčilo Bajagić had already started his solo career, he contributed greatly to this album by authoring two and co-writing another two songs. Also, drummer Vladimir Golubović, who worked with Bajagić on his solo album Pozitivna geografija, temporarily replaced Vicko Milatović, who was doing a mandatory service in the army. Večeras vas zabavljaju muzičari koji piju would be the only album recorded with Golubović and the last album before Bajagić and Rajko Kojić left the band. As Riblja Čorba's record label PGP-RTB did not want to finance recording in London, the band moved to Jugoton. However, Večeras vas zabavljaju muzičari koji piju would be the only album the band released through Jugoton. In his autobiography Uživo!: Autobiografija (Live!: Autobiography) the band's bass guitarist Miša Aleksić described the atmosphere at the recording sessions: Track listing Reception and controversy Immediately after the album's release, state censorship board declared the songs \\"Mangupi vam kvare dete\\" and \\"Besni psi\\" \\"ethically unacceptable\\". \\"Besni psi\\" in particular caused a protracted international scandal. Because of the lyrics \\"Grčki sverceri, arapski studenti, negativni elementi, maloletni delikventi i besni psi\\" (\\"Greek smugglers, Arab students, negative elements, juvenile delinquents, and mad dogs\\"), the embassies of three Arab countries as well as Zaire protested, complaining that songwriter Bora Đorđević had equated foreign students in SFR Yugoslavia with mad dogs. The Yugoslav Ministry of culture ordered an expert analysis of the song. With a somewhat darker atmosphere, the album was not nearly successful as Riblja Čorba's previous albums, bringing only one hit, Momčilo Bajagić's gentle ballad \\"Kad hodaš\\". Legacy The album was polled in 1998 as the 80th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav rock and pop albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music).

Her number 4 hangs on a banner in the volleyball court in USC's Galen Center, along with Tim Hovland's number 10. Coaching Woodstra entered coaching as an assistant at Arizona State in 1995 until she was hired as the head coach of the University of Pittsburgh Panthers women's volleyball team in 1989 where she served as head coach until 1992. During her tenure, she led her teams to Big East Conference Tournament Championships in each season as well as three Big East regular season championships, winning the regular season each year from when the Big East instituted round-robin play in 1990. She also led the Panthers to four post-season appearances including one Women's Invitation Volleyball Championship appearance in 1989 in which Pitt finished third, and three NCAA volleyball tournaments, including in 1990 where Pitt reached the regional semifinal and finished ranked 18th in the final American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) Coaches poll. Woodstra's earned Big East Coach of the Year honors in 1990. Her NCAA tournament teams were led by standout second team All-American outside hitter Ann Marie Lucanie, who won multiple Big East Tournament MVP awards and Big East Player of the Year awards. In total, Woodstra compiled an overall record of 110–39 (.738) over four seasons as head coach. After her tenure at Pitt, Woodstra became the head coach of the SC Münster women's profession volleyball team in Münster, Germany, and led the team to a CEV Cup championship in 1992.

Bloodstock experts also rely on these theories when purchasing young horses or breeding stock. A basic understanding of these theories can also help the racing public understand a horse's theoretical genetic potential. The breeding theories stem from the belief that careful analysis of bloodlines can lend predictability to breeding outcomes. A well-designed mating increases the probability of the offspring's success, although many other factors also come into play. Many thoroughbred breeding theories are implemented from other animal breeding stock practices, such as the use of inbreeding to \\"fix a type\\". Some breeding theories are qualitative, relying on judgement. Quantitative breeding theories usually focus on statistical analysis of the sire and broodmare sires in particular. The best-known classification system for mares was developed in the late 1800s by an Australian named Bruce Lowe, who analyzed the statistics of major race winners and ranked the distaff or mare lines by their degree of success. This and similar ranking systems are still used by some breeders today. Breed the Best to the Best The soundest breeding theory is the simplest one: \\"Breed the best to the best and hope for the best\\" is a phrase that probably originated with John E. Madden in the first half of the twentieth century. Studies have proven that, in general, good racehorses make the best breeding stock. While not all top male runners succeed as stallions, it is much more unusual for a poor racehorse to become a good proven sire. A poorly-raced mare does have a better chance to outbreed her own record on the track, especially when she has a good pedigree and is bred to good stock. On the other hand, statistics have shown that high quality racemares produce an inordinately high percent of high class runners. =The Racecourse Test= The Racecourse Test means that the most important selection criteria for breeding the Thoroughbred is the ability displayed on the racetrack. The Racecourse Test measures a horse's ability to win, which requires a certain combination of speed and stamina depending on the race in question. Racing also tests the horse's strength, soundness and will to win, all of which are heritable to some degree. The ultimate goal is to win elite races, especially The Derby in England or the Kentucky Derby in the United States, and the breed has evolved accordingly. Horses that fail the Racecourse Test, either because they are poor athletes or lack racing spirit, are usually poor candidates as breeding stock. When an unproven racehorse becomes a good sire or broodmare, a further look usually shows that he or she showed tremendous potential in training and was retired due to some untimely circumstance, usually an injury. Such horses usually also have above average pedigrees. An example of the danger of ignoring the Racecourse Test was Sunday Silence, who firmly established his ability on the racetrack as the 1989 Horse of the Year and thus would ordinarily have been given major opportunities as a sire. But his pedigree was not fashionable and there was little interest in America in breeding to him. Thus he was sold to Japan, where he became the leading sire for thirteen straight years. Stallion Statistics Because stallions can have hundreds of offspring, it is possible to do statistical analysis to measure their success, which in turn affects their future prospects at stud. The most commonly used is the Average Earnings Index (AEI), which takes the average earnings of all runners for a specific period and evaluates the stallion's average progeny earnings against that figure. A number below 1.00 is below average. A number above 1.00 is above average. Good stallions generally have an AEI of at least 1.50. The advantage of looking at the AEI compared to straight earnings is that the AEI compensates for differences in the number of runners different stallions may have. The AEI can also be used to compare the relative success of sires over different generations, though larger foal crops in recent years have led to a general decrease in the AEI of the best modern sires compared to those of the past. For context, the AEI should be accompanied by the Comparative Index (CI), which is a way of measuring the quality of the mares to which the stallion was bred. The CI considers all the offspring of the stallion's mates and subtracts out their combined progeny. A stallion with a CI of 2.19 means that when his mares were mated with other sires, the mares produced offspring that averaged 2.19 times the average for the generation in question. If a stallion's AEI is lower than his mares' CI, it is generally a red flag as it suggests that he's not generating the same quality of runners as these mares have produced with other stallions. By contrast, if the stallion's AEI is higher than his mares' CI, the stallion is said to be improving his mares. This generally leads to higher quality mares being bred to him in future years. Another statistic that is valuable to both the bettor and breeder is the Average Winning Distance (AWD), available through the Online Stallion Register maintained by The Blood-Horse and published in some Past Performance charts. By comparing the values for horses in a given race, a bettor can identify which horses have a more speed oriented pedigree, and which have a more stamina oriented pedigree. From a breeding point of view, stallions with a low AWD number are considered to be speed influences, and may be bred to mares whose broodmare sire has a higher number to inject stamina. =Dosage= Dosage is a further attempt to quantify the amount of speed versus stamina in a horse's pedigree. Major sires, called chefs-de-race, are placed in one of five categories: Brilliant, Intermediate, Classic, Solid, and Professional. \\"Brilliant\\" sires offer the highest speed and least stamina, while \\"Professional\\" sires (now quite rare) provide the lowest speed and greatest stamina. A \\"Classic\\" sire offers a balance of speed and stamina traditionally associated with winning classic races. For any given horse, the dosage profile is generated by assigning points for each Chef-de-race in the pedigree, with the number of points varying depending on what generation the chef appears in. The Dosage Index can then be calculated, with a higher number meaning the pedigree is more speed-oriented. A Dosage Index of under 4.00 is considered optimal for horses attempting to win classic races. As the Dosage Profile and Index are widely published, breeders may select mates for their mare with these figures in mind, especially if they are intending to sell the foal at auction. As with Average Winning Distance, if the mare has a Dosage Profile oriented to speed, the breeder may look for a sire that provides stamina influences. The resultant foal would then have a more optimal Dosage Profile. The female line Although much attention is paid to the sire line, Thoroughbred horses are also traced through the distaff line, alternately called the mare line or tail-female line. This maternal line is known as a \\"family\\". This practice dates to the beginning of the General Stud Book (GSB). This was done because the mares produce far fewer foals than stallions and many leading breeders maintained and built families all tracing to a single mare. However, modern genetic studies have revealed that there are some cases where the haplotype in the mtDNA of modern Thoroughbreds, which should not mutate or alter, differs from the records in the General Stud Book, indicating that some female families contain deep rooted pedigree errors. which cites Many horses were inbred in the early years of Thoroughbred development, which increased the chances of early horses appearing in many pedigrees today. One example was Old Bald Peg placed in family 6, one of the earliest tap-root dams, having been foaled around 1635. Most, if not all modern Thoroughbreds trace their ancestry to her through one or both sides of their pedigree. =Bruce Lowe families= Around 1895 an Australian, Bruce Lowe, wrote: “Breeding Racehorses by the Figure System”. He formulated a system of family numbers from the mares listed in the General Stud Book. Lowe believed that the three foundation sires of the Thoroughbred were successful largely due to the mares they were bred to, and so predicting race horse quality required identification and assessment of the mare lines. Lowe stated, > The figures are derived from a statistical compilation of the winners of the > three great English classic races, Derby, Oaks and St. Leger. The family > with the largest number of wins is No. 1, the next No. 2 and so on up to No. > 43, and include families whose descendants have not won a classic race. During the 1950s Kaziemierz Bobinski and Count Zamoyski produced Family Tables of Racehorses, commonly known as the Bobinski Tables. This work expanded Bruce Lowe's numbering system of 43 families and identified a total of 74 families tracing to mares in the GSB. which cites They identified mares in several countries whose pedigrees had been lost or whose descendants were unacceptable to the GSB at the time of Lowe’s work. Bobinski later updated his works and split Lowe's families into sub categories. The current female family tables were updated by Toru Shirai of the Japanese Bloodstock Agency with the latest update occurring in 2004. =Analysis and use= Old Bald Peg, dam of the Old Morocco Mare (c.1655) :Thoroughbred families include the following: :* Families 1-43 are described by Bruce Lowe's Breeding Racehorses by the Figure System :* Families A1-A37 descend from Sanders Bruce's American Stud Book, with mares who cannot be traced to Weatherbys :* Families Ar1-Ar2 are Argentine families :* Families B1-B26 trace directly to F.M. Prior's Half-Bred Studbook :* Families C1-C16 are described in the Australian Stud Book as approved Colonial Families :* Families C17-C33 descend from Australian and New Zealand mares who cannot be traced to the GSB :* Families P1-P2 are Polish families =Family branches= Over time, the influence of the foundation mares of each family becomes diluted by the presence of all the other horses in a given pedigree. On the other hand, some of the younger mares of the family become so influential that a new family is created to separate out their offspring. For example, Family 1 refers to all horses who trace back in the female line to Tregonwell's Natural Barb Mare, foaled c. 1670. It is estimated that about 15% of modern thoroughbreds belong to family 1 as a whole. Five generations of the family later, the mare Bonny Lass (1723) was so influential that a new family 1-a was designated for her descendants. Family 1-a was subsequently split into families 1-d (Promise, 1768) and 1-b (Morel, 1805). The Promise family 1-d spawned further families and so on to the present, where there are now 22 designated branches (1-a to 1-x) within the overall family 1. It takes many generations for the most influential mares to be identified so most of these family branches date back to the 18th and 19th century. The most recent branch was created for descendants of La Troienne (1926), family 1-x. The mare Penelope (foaled 1798) produced two Derby winners, and established family 1-o, a branch of family 1. Her female line descendants established further branches over the following decades The overall structure of family 1 is as follows: * Tregonwell's Natural Barb Mare (foundation mare of family 1) ** was the fifth dam of Bonny Lass (1723, family 1-a) *** who was the third dam of Promise (1768, family 1-d) **** who was the dam of Prunella (1788, family 1-e) ***** who was the dam of Penelope (1798, family 1-o) ****** who was the dam of Web (1808, family 1-s) ******* who was the fifth dam of Queen Bertha (1860, family 1-w) ******* Web was also the twelfth dam of La Troienne (1926, family 1-x) ******* and the dam of Trampoline (1825, family 1-t) ******** who was the third dam of Maid of the Glen (1858, family 1-u) ****** Penelope was also the fifth dam of Hilarity (1871, 1-p) ****** and the fourth dam of The Prairie Bird (1844, 1-r) ***** Prunella was also the dam of Pawn (1808, family 1-f) ****** who was the third dam of Ellen Horne (1844, family 1-j) ******* who was the second dam of Paraffin (1870, family 1-l) ******** who was the dam of Footlight (1876, family 1-m) ********* who is second dam of Chelandry (1894, family 1-n) ******* Ellen Horne was also the dam of Rouge Rose (1865, family 1-k) ****** Pawn was also the dam of Problem (1823, family 1-g) ******* who was the fourth dam of Sunshine (1867, family 1-h) ******** who was the dam of Sunray (1874, family 1-i) *** Bonny Lass was also the fourth dam of Morel (1805, family 1-b) **** who was the dam of Mustard (1824, family 1-c) Today, these numbers often follow a horse’s name in sale catalogues and pedigrees, much like a numerical surname and are used for checking the accuracy of pedigrees and comparing the contributions made by various mares and families. Horses that come from more highly respected families will usually command better prices than those from less respected bloodlines, although they may not prove to be better as racehorses or sires/broodmares.  Nicking  Specific affinities of stallions of one male line for mares from other sire lines—commonly called Nicks—have made a profound impact on the development of the Thoroughbred. Compatibility of stallions from one male line with mares from other sire lines has shaped the breed since the cross of Eclipse with mares by Herod in the late 18th century. These successful crosses–Hermit/Stockwell, Lexington/Glencoe, Bend Or/Macaroni, Phalaris/Chaucer–have made a profound impact on the development of the Thoroughbred. While modern calculations of nick ratings use more complete databases, there has been criticism of nicks and nick ratings within the Thoroughbred industry.  Inbreeding versus Outcrossing  Inbreeding is the mating of two closely related individuals. It is known as one of the quickest ways to \\"fix\\" desired characteristics into a bloodline of any species. The risk is that the inbreeding will reveal negative recessive characteristics; thus, \\"closebreeding\\" is usually avoided. Continued inbreeding over a series of generations also has a negative impact referred to as \\"inbreeding depression.\\" The lines may become dominant for certain characteristics, but the offspring also tend to become weaker, less vigorous individuals than animals that are not as inbred. In the thoroughbred industry, inbreeding is used to focus specific genes by using superior, prepotent individuals, usually within the fourth and sixth generations. Inbred animals are likely conduits for certain specific characteristics coming from their inbred ancestor. Too much inbreeding is not desirable and rarely produces the superior runner. But inbred animals frequently make outstanding breeding stock because when outcrossed, superior hybrid individuals often result. Secretariat is an example of such hybrid vigor.

It is a tax-exempt 501c3 charitable nonprofit. The organization was founded by Laura O. Moore, a pediatric nurse. The organization eventually served \\"children [who] had been abandoned by their families because they didn’t have the means to properly care for the child. In other instances, the child had been taken from the parents or caregivers because of abuse or neglect.\\" (Article is marked with 2008 copyright, but possibly was updated through 2015?) Children could stabilize and improve with good care, and then returning them to their families, placing them in foster homes and/or obtaining adoption would be possible. History In the fall of 2001, Laura O. Moore founded the organization as The Dream House for Kids, a non-profit organization dedicated to moving medically fragile children out of institutions and to educate these children's families, caregivers, and communities about issues that affect them. Moore was trained as a pediatric intensive care nurse. In December 2002 the organization was renamed the Dream House For Medically Fragile Children. Laura Moore and her husband took in Katie as a foster child in 2004. The organization expanded in 2004, hiring a separate Executive Director, allowing the founder to serve in other ways. =\\"Person of the Week\\"= During 2008, ABC News with Charles Gibson regularly ran a segment named \\"Person of the Week\\" that highlighted extraordinary persons. ABC News had noticed the story of Laura Moore and the Dream House in People Magazine. Laura Moore as \\"ABC Person of the Week\\" became a segment on nationwide news. Gibson called the house an \\"oasis in rural Georgia ...\\" (1:15 on). Laura had by then found homes for 12 children. =Care and closure= The organization ran an actual transitional housing facility in a large house, but it was forced to close the house in 2011 for financial reasons, leading to some of its wards being replaced into state custody. During the course of its existence, the Dream House had about 100 residents. The organization had served about 1,000 children, of which about 100 had actually lived in the house for some period. Those were the most dire cases, of orphans and those whose families could not adequately handle their care. The house served as a \\"live-in transition home for children dependent on equipment, medication or constant nursing care to survive, many of which are orphans or wards of the state\\" and was \\"essentially rescuing them from living in the hospital as they awaited a caring foster family.\\" According to the organization, ninety percent of children served were served via weekend programs training and assisting families, and other non-residential care. In the financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2014, the board of directors stated that with regret the organization was to close down in August. (see last page) Programs The organization runs three programs: a \\"Weekend Retreat\\" respite program that \\"offers an opportunity where the children can feel at home, while their families can receive a much-needed break from the stress and exhaustion that comes from providing constant, around the clock care\\", a \\"Family for Keeps®\\" education and skills training program that \\"provides tailored instruction that teaches foster, adoptive and biological families, social work professionals and other caregivers how to provide safe and effective care for medically fragile children at home,\\" and a \\"Bridging the Gap\\" program that is intended \\"to help foster, adoptive and biological families acquire health care supplies, home modifications, and equipment necessary to provide safe and accessible homes for their medically fragile children.\\" Development The nonprofit benefited from a 2007 fundraiser headlined by Atlanta Braves baseball player Jeff Francoeur, involving Delta Air Lines' frequent flyer program, SkyMiles, donating the value of 25,000 Skymiles for each homerun hit by Francoeur during the season. In 2007, Moore was named a Volvo For Life Award category winner, garnering a $50,000 donation by Volvo to the charity. In 2007, Moore was named Gwinnett Magazine's Woman of the Year.Gwinnett Magazine's Best Local Charities and Laura Moore - Woman of the Year (link not working, info not fully confirmed, as of 2/10/2014) In 2008, for her work in the nonprofit, founder Moore was named a finalist in the Health-Care Innovation section of the 2008 Atlanta Business Chronicle's \\"Health-Care Heroes Awards\\". By 2008, the organization had 18 staff, had raised more than $3 million, and had served 900 children throughout Georgia. (website no longer available, 11/2015) Laura Moore was covered in People and named ABC Person of the Week on the ABC News program in 2008. Its required filing for 2012 shows that the organization achieved revenues over one million dollars in 2010–2011, and had assets of $585,000 and net assets of 210,000 as of June 30, 2012. The report also states that the program would in the future change its program goal towards its weekend program.

After 1946, Church policies, with wars ongoing in Korea, the Mandate of Palestine and other places, continued to propagate peace and aid the afflicted, especially in war-torn Europe. Pius XII began a process of worldwide reconstruction of war-damaged Catholic institutions. He promoted the internationalization of the Church with reforms of the Church, internationalizing the College of Cardinals in two consistories. For working women he repeatedly demanded equal pay for equal work.AAS, XXXVII (1945 Church policies After World War II, some 60,000,000 Catholics were under the influence of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. Relations with the United States were cordial. Faced with a war in the Middle East, Pius called for mutual respect for and between the three major religions, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. He insisted on their free access to Holy Sites, especially in Jerusalem. In his war-time message, Pius had called for an international order and the establishment of international organizations. He therefore welcomed the creation of such organizations after the war, and appointed Papal representatives or observers to them. Pacelli supported a unification of Europe. In 1957, following the signing of the Treaty of Rome, he received the heads of government and State of the newly founded European Union, to express his gratification and give his blessings. Papal charity: policies and practices =Displaced persons and prisoners of war= On 6 January 1946, the encyclical Quemadmodum issued an urgent call for charity. The Pope described the misery of millions of people in war-torn areas, and insisted that all persons must help. He was especially concerned with the millions of small children without families, food or shelter. As in the war years, the Pope offered material help. During the war, some 200,000 messages were sent via Vatican identifying displaced persons and prisoners to their respective families.Smit, p. 230 Pius was an outspoken advocate of clemency for those accused of war crimes, including Ernst von Weizsäcker, who was ambassador to the Vatican in the last two years of the war. The U.S. nuncio appealed to commute the sentences of several Germans convicted by the occupation authorities. The Vatican, opposed to the death penalty, asked for a blanket pardon for all those who had received death sentences after the ban on execution of war criminals was lifted in 1948. After the war, the Vatican continued its information services. Vatican Radio began a daily hour for prisoners and interned to South Africa, Belgian Congo, Kenya, North Africa, Australia, India, England and North America.Smit, 231 The DPs created often special problems, because many thousands of them did not have any identification. Preliminary identity papers and food were distributed to long lines of persons, waiting for hours. Identity papers were issued throughout Italy by Vatican charity officials and Red Cross representatives. Forty years later, controversy arose as to whether some Nazi officials benefited from these Red Cross or Vatican papers, issued in the grand chaos of 1945-1947. Most certainly, neither the Red Cross nor the Vatican had the time or resources to check individual identity claims at the time. This situation was possibly exploited by the controversial Alois Hudal, who was later dismissed from his posts, the rat line, but by also many persons of other persuasions, who wanted to start a new life under a new name away from friends and family. Immigration rights As millions of refugees without any home or place to go, wandered all over the Europe, Pius XII insisted that immigration is a natural right and duty. In 1946, he declared, that all people have a right to immigration, because the Creator himself demands access to material goods. In addition, compassion supports immigration rights. Conversely, no state which can support additional people, has a right to close its immigration doors without reason.Smit, p. 233 ** Natural law even more than mere compassion compels States to secure people a chance of immigration, because the Creator demands that the goods of this world should be at the service of all mankind. Therefore, no state whose territory is in a condition to feed more people, has the right to refuse admission to foreigners without good and acceptable reasons.Acta Apostolica Sedis, XLI, 1949, pp. 69–71 Charitable works =Madre Pascalina= Pius dealt with the human tragedies by organizing a two- tier papal charity. Monsignore Ferdinando Baldelli, Carlo Egger and Otto Faller started on behalf of the pope the official Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza.Primo Mazzolari, La Carita Del Papa, Pio XII.e la ricostruzione dell’Italia, Edizione Paoline, 1991) Madre Pascalina Lehnert was asked by the Pope to direct his personal charity efforts, officially under Monsignore Montini, later Pope Paul VI. To assist the pope in the many calls for his help and charity, Pascalina organized and led the Magazino, a private papal charity office, which began with 40 helpers and continued until 1959. “It started from modest beginnings and became a gigantic charity”.Lehnert, Pascalina. p. 104 Lehnert organized truck caravans filled with medicine, clothing, shoes and food to prison camps and hospitals, provided first aid, food and shelter for bomb victims, fed the hungry population of Rome, answered emergency calls for aid to the Pope, sent care packages to France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Austria and other countries. After the war, the calls for papal help continued in war-torn Europe: Madre Pascalina organized emergency aid to displaced persons, prisoners of war, victims of floods, and many victims of the war. Pascalina distributed also hundreds of religious items to needy priests. In later years, priests with very large parishes received small cars or motor bikes.”Lehnert, p. 104 The Pope was personally involved, constantly asking bishops from the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico and other countries for help.”Lehnert, p. 103 Cardinals and bishops freely visited Madre Pascalina, who by now was nicknamed \\"Virgo Potens\\" (:Powerful Virgin\\"). The papal Commissione di Assistenza to the most needy populations of Europe delivered more than ninety thousand crates. They were shipped by rail from Vatican station to dozens of countries Smit, p. 234 In 1946, the Pontiff invited 50,000 children to receive a full meal after which the Pope thanked the benefactors of the United Nations for their generosity.L'Osservatore Romano, 27 January 1946 As Bishop of Rome he increased papal soup kitchen rations from three million annually to forty million by 1947. At Christmas 1944, he personally gave gift packages to three thousand Roman children and delivered another four thousand to children on the Feast of Epiphany, two weeks later. By Christmas 1945, Pope Pius had forty thousand packages. The Swedish King Gustav V awarded Pope Pius XII with the “Prince Carl Medal”, given annually to the person with the most outstanding record in charity in the world. L'Osservatore Romano, 1 March 1947 Pope Pius responded in his Easter message to Communist leaders who attacked his policies: : The Church of Rome is subjected these days to public denunciations and the most unjust attacks. In vain, the Church multiplied its charities to this city, the centre of Christianity. In vain, the Church accepted, protected, and saved persons of all kinds, including its most ardent opponents. In vain she was upholding in times of tyrannic repression the rights and dignity of every person. In vain, she fed the population of Eternal Rome in times of need and massive hunger. The Church which helped, is now allegedly responsible for the impoverisation and proletarisation of the masses, which in times of need she assisted and continues to assist.\\" Herder Korrespondenz, p. 303 In his 1944 speech to the directors of the Pontifical Missionary Society, he stated: : The herald of the Gospel and messenger of Christ is an apostle. His office does not demand that he transplant European civilization and culture, and no other, to foreign soil, there to take root and propagate itself. His task in dealing with these peoples, who sometimes boast of a very old and highly developed culture of their own, is to teach and form them so that they are ready to accept willingly and in a practical manner the principles of Christian life and morality; principles, I might add, that fit into any culture, provided it be good and sound, and which give that culture greater force in safeguarding human dignity and in gaining human happiness.Evangelii 60 China For centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize the ancient local Confucian customs of honouring deceased family members. The Vatican regarded these as religious exercises which conflicted with Catholic dogma. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith issued at the request of Pius XII new instructions, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered superstitious but rather an honourable way of esteeming one's relatives, and therefore permitted by Catholics.Smit, pp. 186-187 The Government of China established diplomatic relations with the Vatican within a short interval. The Papal degree changed the ecclesiastical situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.Smit, p. 188 As the Church began to flourish, Pius established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, Thomas Tien Ken-sin, SVD, into the College of Cardinals.Smit 188. The establishment of Mao Zedong's communist regime in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the persecution of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. Japan Diplomatic relations with the Japanese government were established in 1942, during the war. Following the defeat of the Japanese Empire, these relations were broken, bur were reestablished in 1952 as Japan regained its independence. Korea In 1947 when Pope Pius XII sent the first apostolic delegate, Father Patrick James Byrne to Korea, shortly after the liberation of Korea from Japanese dominion. By sending a permanent delegate, the Holy See was one of the first countries to recognize Korea as an independent nation after the liberation from the Japanese colonization. Patrick James Byrne, American missionary of the Maryknoll's fathers, was consecrated Bishop in 1949, but when the Korean War broke out in 1950, he was kidnapped and died in prison. In those years, the South Korean government sent a delegation to the Paris conference in 1948 to be recognized as the only Government of the Korean peninsula. At that time the Holy See and the Apostolic Nuncio in Paris (then Angelo Roncalli, later Pope John XXIII) greatly helped the Korean delegation to obtain recognition from many delegations of Catholic countries.ASIA/SOUTH KOREA - A Bishop represents Korea to celebrate 70 years of diplomatic relations with the Holy See 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Africa and Asia For more than a hundred years, the Church has been building up infrastructures for education and health services in large parts of their African and Asian missions, including basic health stations but also specialized hospitals and universities. WWII had been a disaster for Catholic missions, educational and health institutes in Asia and Africa. In Europe, the houses of various orders and congregations, which prepare candidates for work oversees, were emptying. Priests and lay brothers, teachers and nurses, were called home from oversees to participate in military duty. Missionaries with the “wrong” passport were interned or expelled from the countries they worked in. After Japan declared war, much of Asia including the Philippines and Indochina became battlefields. Catholic churches, hospitals and schools were destroyed or closed.Smit, p. 187 Under Japanese occupation, many missionaries were living in concentration camps and were mistreated. After the war, Pius helped rebuild the institutional presence and accelerated the pace of turning over control to local authorities. His encyclicals, Evangelii praecones and Fidei donum, issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions and recognition of local culture, especially in Africa. Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius supported the establishment of local administration and a reduction of colonial influence in Church affairs: In 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent, 1951 Southern Africa and 1953 in British Eastern Africa. Finland, Burma and French Africa became independent dioceses in 1955. They remained financially dependent, however, from Western resources. Latin America Latin America had independent Catholic hierarchies in 1939, when Pius XII was elected as Pope. During the war years, the governments and faithful of Latin America had been helpful, with large shipments of food items and clothing for Vatican charity services such as the Commissione Di Assistenza. Pius XII negotiated with Brazil a visa program for \\"non-Aryan\\" Catholics, a program subject to stringent conditions until its premature termination. After the war, Pius devoted special attention to the subcontinent, addressing in each country virtually every major Church meeting over Vatican Radio in the years 1946-1958. Concerned about the continuing lack of clergy in Latin America, he formed in 1958 the foundation of the permanent Papal Commission for Latin America. Several orders, Dominicans, Jesuits and even the Trappists, made foundations there at the request of the Pope. Europe After the war, Pius rejected the concept of “collective guilt”. Pointing to the enormous crimes committed, he demanded punishment of the guilty and stiff penalties for persons guilty of war crimes or crimes against humanity.Discorsi, 1945, p. 68 He supported the Nuremberg trials with documentation, and was repeatedly quoted in the proceedings against Nazi war criminals. One year after the German capitulation, in June 1946 he challenged the Allies to finally close the Nazi concentration camps, which they had kept running to accommodate POWs and DPs.Schambeck, p. 158 Pius did not protest the expulsion of millions of Germans from their homes by Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union due to the diplomatic deadlock with those (then) Soviet-bloc nations. His material assistance from the Commissione Di Assistenza reached many. Schambeck, p. 56 He did not support changes of borders. Throughout his pontificate, he refused to engage in border issues, such as the Polish-German border disputes. Russia Poland Italy In July 1940, L'Osservatore Romano informed its readers: During the War, the Roman-born Pontiff was very concerned with the question, how to save the eternal city from the fate of destruction. He decided to stay day and night in Rome as not to give an excuse for bombings in his absence. He also communicated with FDR and Churchill regarding a sparing for his city. As German troops withdrew from the South of Italy, he helped to negotiate an open city agreement, by which German military circumvented Rome and thus did not offer military targets there. After the Germans left, the Roman population flocked to St. Peter's square to thank the “Savior of Rome” One of them was Pietro Nenni, the socialist leader who first refused to kneel down, until his wife forced him to. Later, Pope Pius was named saviour of the city and of civilisation.Smit, P. 216 But due to the international climate, and the communist persecution of the Church in the East, relations between the Vatican and Communism soured. The 1948 were seen as a watershed for the future of Italy and Europe and became a fight between the Catholic Church and the Communist Party of Italy. In his Easter homily of 1948, Pius appealed to the Roman people: : \\"There is no room in our conscience for faint-heartedness, for comfort, for the indecisiveness of many who, in this crucial hour, believe they can serve two masters.\\" HK359 With 49% of the vote, the elections of 18 April 1948 went in favor of the anti-Communist Christian Democrats. On 15 July 1948, L'Osservatore Romano published a degree which excommunicated those who propagate “the materialistic and anti-Christian teachings of communism”, which was widely interpreted as an excommunication of the Communist Party of Italy, which however, was not mentioned in the decree. The excommunication extended to any Italian Catholic who was a Communist candidate in the parliamentary elections. It specifically did not include persons, who distributed Communist books, papers or leaflets, although those actions were condemned as well.L'Osservatore Romano, 15 July 1948 Azione Cattolica very actively supported the Christian Democratic Party. In 1949, the Holy Office issued the Decree against Communism, which excommunicated any Catholic who joined or collaborated with the Communist Party. A United Europe In 1933, Pacelli met the President of “Pan-Europe” Count Coudenhove- Kalergi, giving his support to the idea of a European federation.Halecki, p. 293. He embraced the initiative of Winston Churchill for a “Congress of Europe” in 1948, and sent a Papal delegate to the Hague meeting.Halecki, p. 294. The European Economic Community was founded in Rome in 1957, the last year of Pius XII's papacy. As Europe recovered, Pius had encouraged European unification attempts and the foundation of the EU. He addressed the heads of State and governments from Italy, France, Germany, and the Benelux countries at this historic occasion. On 13 June 1957 he demanded a united Europe, aware of its foundations, with common institutions, a common foreign policy, and a strong European parliament to control the institutions and the council of ministers.Schambeck, p. 97. USA President Harry Truman believed that permanent peace can only be achieved on a Christian basis, and informed the Pope, \\"Your Holiness, we are a Christian Nation, as the US Supreme Court decided more than half a century ago\\" and re-appointed Myron C. Taylor as a representative to the Holy See.The Public Papers of President Harry S. Truman, 1947, p. 178Statement by the President on Myron Taylor's Mission to the Vatican. August 15, 1947 Vatican relations with America were cordial and largely free of conflict. Joseph P. Kennedy, father of John F. Kennedy, attended the Papal coronation as representative of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. William Henry O'Connell of Boston was the first Cardinal invited by the new Pope after his election. Cardinal George Mundelein of Chicago was his second guest.Padellaro, p. 346 In 1936, then Cardinal Pacelli was the first Pope to ever visit the United States. He toured the nation with Bishop Francis Spellman, visiting twelve of sixteen ecclesiastical provinces and meeting with seventy-nine bishops.Smit, pp. 82-83. He gave a policy address at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.. He had meetings with President Roosevelt which ... led to a resumption of de facto diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the US, which had been in limbo since 1868.Halecki, p. 372 Pius had left the initiative to the American president, realizing the complicated situation he faced in the American Congress, which had refused to approve a Papal minister in 1868, thus de facto closing the doors for an American presence at the Vatican. He privately protested repeated American bombings of Rome.Halecki, p. 184 After the war, Pius supported the Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower administrations to rebuild war-torn Europe and to defend freedom. In a well-publicized appeal, he wrote to President Eisenhower to spare the lives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, sentenced to death because of alleged espionage for the Soviet Union.Schulte, E., \\"The trial of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg\\", The International Socialist Review, Issue 29, May–June 2003USATODAY.com - 50 years later, Rosenberg execution is still freshAlan Woods, \\"America after 1945 and McCarthyism\\", Marxism in the USA, 2005 Pius invited Americans, Europeans, Africans and Asians in the Italian-dominated Vatican Curia. He encouraged young Americans to enter Vatican service. To provide better training and international exposure of American theology students, he welcomed the establishment of a large seminary exclusively for Americans in Rome. It was opened and blessed by him in the presence of virtual all American bishops. He was close to Francis Spellman, a friend of Domenico Tardini. Spellman was the first American ever to work in the Secretariat. In 1931, Pacelli consecrated him to be the first American bishop in Saint Peter's Basilica. Spellman was elevated to the seat of New York immediately after the election of Pope Pius XII. Spellman, who accompanied a groups of American pilgrims to Rome in October 1958, was also the last American and one of the last foreign dignitaries to see Pope Pius before his death on 9 October 1958. Concordats and treaties of Pope Pius XII After WWI, the Church was confronted with a variety of short-lived government styles, monarchies, military rule, fascism, communism, and left-wing and right-wing regimes as well as some democratic governments. To fulfill its mission under changing circumstances, the Vatican insisted on freedom of religion for Catholics. Already under Pope Benedict XV, but especially under Pope Pius XI, a record number of new concordats were concluded. To Pius XII, Church freedom was the ultimate priority: : “We turn to the leaders of people, in order for the Church to live in freedom. Concordats are legal instruments. Taking into consideration the best for the population and the State, they are intended to create the space, in which the Catholic Church and the Catholics of a given country can freely live their faith and develop it”.AAS, 1957, p. 1033 Pius concluded some thirty concordats and State treaties during his pontificate. Treaties were concluded with Brazil (1950), Canada (1951), France (1952), Great Britain (1953), The Netherlands (1957), United States of America 1957). New Apostolic delegations were established in Indonesia (1947), Palestine and Jordan (1948), Dakar (1948), Pakistan (1950) and Thailand (1957). New nunciatures were established in Uruguay (1939), Lebanon (1947), The Philippines (1951) China (1946), Indonesia (1950), Egypt (1947), India (1948), Liberia (1951), Pakistan (1951), Japan (1952), Syria (1953), Iran (1953), Ethiopia (1957). A personal representative of the President of the United States of America was accredited at the Vatican since December 1939. Representatives of the Vatican were sent to several United Nations Organizations, such as UNESCO and ILO.See: AAS 1939-1959 Quotations of Pope Pius XII : We know full well, that the bare text of international law does not impose on the conquerors the obligation to liberate the prisoners of war, before peace is made. But the spiritual and moral needs of the prisoners themselves and of their relatives, the sacred rights of marriage and family, speak a loader and stronger voice than all judicial texts, and demand that we bring the system of war prisoners and concentration camps to an end.L'Osservatore Romano, 2 June 1946 *It seems desirable to us, to secure a new domicile in oversees countries for many of these people, who in the latter years were exiled from their land, or who live in over-populated countries, in which neither agriculture nor industry can give sufficient livelihood even in normal times. And we are confident, that the states which still dispose of ample possibilities of existence, will not fail to open their frontiers for immigration, because this is a sublime form of Christian charity.Smit, pp. 232-233 *The natural law even more than mere compassion compels he states to secure people a chance of immigration, because the creator demands that the goods of this world should be at the service of all mankind.

Her main achievement is her part in the silver medal won by the United States at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. She later moved to Italy to play professionally, settling in Reggio Emilia where she stayed after ending her playing career. Career =Palmyra High School= The Nebraskan led the Palmyra high school volleyball team to their first appearance in the state tournament, earning Sunday Journal and Star All-State honors. Graduating in 1977, she was later inducted into the Nebraska High School Sports Hall of Fame (in 1994). =Team USA= Straight out of high school, Vollertsen travelled to California to take part in a six- week tryout for the women's junior national volleyball team, she ended up being the only one to be kept on the team. She progressed up to the senior United States national team, being chosen as an alternate for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, but the US did not go due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. Vollertsen was a part of a volleyball program that, since 1975, regrouped the national team players (of which she was the only one not from California or Texas) in Coto de Caza, California where they trained and lived together relentlessly under coach Arie Selinger. In effect, they constituted an organised team (though all amateurs, receiving only expenses) that played in as many tournaments worldwide as possible. Team US and Vollertsen won a bronze medal at the 1982 World Championship, losing to hosts Peru in three games. They added a silver medal at the 1983 Pan American Games. She served the winning point in the 1983 NORCECA Women's Volleyball Championship title game against Cuba in which the US finished undefeated. The main goal of all these efforts was the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics for which Team USA qualified as hosts. They started the competition with a 3-0 win against West Germany. The second game proved tougher, with opponents Brazil winning the first two sets. The United States then rallied to a 3-2 victory, with Vollertsen serving nine consecutive winning points in the fourth game after a 5-5. With the win, the team had already set the best ever Olympic record for the Women's National Volleyball Team, besting the solitary win obtained in 1964. In the third group game against world champions China, in which the already qualified teams were playing to avoid a semifinal matchup with Japan, she had a crucial impact off the bench, scoring points off serves and spikes as the US earned a 3-1 upset. The semifinal against Peru was a rematch of the 1982 world championship, this time Team US were victors, with Vollertsen scoring two decisive serves to win the first game. Meeting China again in the final, Vollertsen and the US could not repeat their earlier victory and were beaten 3-0. Their silver medal was still a historic first medal for any national volleyball team (the Men's side would win a gold medal a few days later). =Reggio Emilia= Vollertsen moved to Italy after the tournament, joining professional side Nelsen Reggio Emilia in 1984. She played four years with the side, being eliminated from title contention on three occasions by perennial champions Teodora Pallavolo Ravenna . She did win a CEV Cup in 1986, adding an Italian cup later that same year. Vollertsen retired after the 1987–88 season. Post playing career After retiring as a player, she started a coaching career (with youth teams), which she ended in 1991, after the birth of her first child. Vollertsen was incorporated into the Emilia Romagna provincial Olympic Committee in March 2009, as athlete representative on the board. She was elected vice-president later that year. In 2013, she was reappointed in the former role until 2016.

It is used for categorical data; see Read and Cressie.Read, T. R. C. and Cressie, N. A. C. (1988). Goodness-of-fit statistics for discrete multivariate data. New York: Springer-Verlag. . Beginning with a sample of N items each of which has been observed to fall into one of k categories. It is possible to define \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_k) as the observed numbers of items in each cell. Hence \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^k x_{i} = N. Next, defining a vector of parameters H_0: \\\\mathbf{\\\\pi} = (\\\\pi_{1}, \\\\pi_{2}, \\\\dots, \\\\pi_{k}), where :\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\pi_{i} = 1. These are the parameter values under the null hypothesis. The exact probability of the observed configuration \\\\mathbf{x} under the null hypothesis is given by :\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x)_0} = N! \\\\prod_{i=1}^k \\\\frac{\\\\pi_{i}^{x_i}}{x_i!}. The significance probability for the test is the probability of occurrence of the data set observed, or of a data set less likely than that observed, if the null hypothesis is true. Using an exact test, this is calculated as :\\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{sig})=\\\\sum_{y: Pr(\\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\le Pr(\\\\mathbf{x)_0}} \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y}) where the sum ranges over all outcomes as likely as, or less likely than, that observed. In practice this becomes computationally onerous as k and N increase so it is probably only worth using exact tests for small samples. For larger samples, asymptotic approximations are accurate enough and easier to calculate. One of these approximations is the likelihood ratio. An alternative hypothesis can be defined under which each value \\\\pi_{i} is replaced by its maximum likelihood estimate p_{i}=x_{i}/N. The exact probability of the observed configuration \\\\mathbf{x} under the alternative hypothesis is given by : \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{x)_A} = N! \\\\prod_{i=1}^k \\\\frac{p_{i}^{x_i}}{x_i!}. The natural logarithm of the ratio between these two probabilities multiplied by -2 is then the statistic for the likelihood ratio test : -2\\\\ln(L/R) = \\\\textstyle -2\\\\sum_{i=1}^k x_{i}\\\\ln(\\\\pi_{i}/p_{i}) . If the null hypothesis is true, then as N increases, the distribution of -2\\\\ln(LR) converges to that of chi-squared with k-1 degrees of freedom. However it has long been known (e.g. Lawley 1956) that for finite sample sizes, the moments of -2\\\\ln(LR) are greater than those of chi- squared, thus inflating the probability of type I errors (false positives). The difference between the moments of chi-squared and those of the test statistic are a function of N^{-1}. Williams (1976) showed that the first moment can be matched as far as N^{-2} if the test statistic is divided by a factor given by : q_1 = 1+\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\pi_{i}^{-1}-1}{6N(k-1)}. In the special case where the null hypothesis is that all the values \\\\pi_{i} are equal to 1/k (i.e. it stipulates a uniform distribution), this simplifies to : q_1 = 1+\\\\frac{k+1}{6N}. Subsequently, Smith et al. (1981) derived a dividing factor which matches the first moment as far as N^{-3}. For the case of equal values of \\\\pi_{i}, this factor is : q_2 = 1+\\\\frac{k+1}{6N}+\\\\frac{k^2}{6N^2}. The null hypothesis can also be tested by using Pearson's chi-squared test : \\\\chi^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} {(x_i - E_i)^2 \\\\over E_i} where E_i=N\\\\pi_i is the expected number of cases in category i under the null hypothesis. This statistic also converges to a chi-squared distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom when the null hypothesis is true but does so from below, as it were, rather than from above as -2\\\\ln(LR) does, so may be preferable to the uncorrected version of -2\\\\ln(LR) for small samples.

P. Kludze Jr.http://www.stevens.edu/ses/cser/2005/authors/7.pdf is a rocket scientist, U.S. Civil Servant, Complex Systems Engineering and Design Expert, and a senior NASA Spacecraft Systems Engineer. Life Kludze was born in Hohoe, in the Volta Region of Ghana, the son of Anselmus Kludze, the legal reformer. He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s with only a High School diploma from the Adisadel College in Cape Coast, Ghana and 'A' levels from Swedru Secondary School. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, he enrolled at Rutgers University where he set out to pursue a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. After graduation, he contemplated a return to Ghana to pursue an interest in the development of various solar gadgets and merchandise, including solar freezer, solar air conditioning, solar water heater, solar lamps, etc. He believed strongly that, for Africa to develop, it must use its natural resources and incorporate technologies that benefit the continent. He considered the sun to be a natural resource and its use may be of great benefit to the continent. Kludze, who grew up in Dansoman- Sahara, a suburb of Accra, made a name for himself as a young genius, who was fascinated with science at an early age; he had a reputation for questioning almost everything, and also for his unusual domestic scientific experiments and thinking. His love of science began at an early age; his parents once remarked that they were fearful to leave him at home in case he dismantled the radio. At friends’ houses, he would take apart their televisions to see how they worked. By his own admission, Kludze's fascination with aviation began with a trip to the airport in Accra as a young boy. His father had intended him to become a lawyer but supported him regardless in his ambitions. Career Kludze has held positions at various NASA Centers including the NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia and NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where he became if not the first African, the first Ghanaian to ever fly (command and control) a Spacecraft in Orbit (including the ERBS and TRMM Spececrafts, etc. for NASA from a mission control center). He designed the Human Locator System, which he called the \\"HuLos\\" in partial fulfillment of the requirements for his master's degree at the Johns Hopkins University. The HuLos uses nanotechnology (microscopic technology) and is intended to locate human beings anywhere on this planet using satellite communication, GPS and other technologies. What made the system unique at the time of its conception, though considered weird by even his advisor, were the miniaturized size and the concept of global location. The device is to be implanted under the human skull, skin bone or teeth and activated when required. The system as envisioned could be used e.g. in locating missing children, the elderly, stolen cars and hardened criminals. The thesis which contains the design is currently at the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University. In 2004, Kludze and a group of NASA engineers developed the Extravehicular Activity Infrared (EVA IR) camera for space-walking astronauts. The EVA IR camera was designed to fulfill a critical inspection need for the Shuttle Program; the on-orbit IR Camera can detect crack and surface defects in the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) sections of the Space Shuttle's Thermal Protection System. This camera may help discover and prevent some of the problems leading to the disintegration of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Kludze was selected to join the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC), an organization created after the Columbia incident, as a systems engineering expert. Before joining the NESC, Kludze was the manager of NASA Langley's state-of-the-art Integrated Design Center (IDC) which he helped to develop. He was also the Traceability and Verification Manager for the CALIPSO spacecraft. His pioneering work in systems engineering has been published worldwide; he has a number of publications, several NASA and external awards and recognitions to his credit. Kludze will be involved in several space initiatives including the implementation of the U.S. President's Space Exploration Vision to the Moon, Mars and beyond. Kludze holds bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in engineering. In 2002, Kludze was recognised and honoured at the Second Biennial Adisadel College Excellence Awards at a ceremony at the State House in Accra, by the Adisadel College Old Boys Association and the College. He was profiled on Cable News Network (CNN) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

The mechanical man possesses super-human speed and strength. The scientist is killed however by a gang of criminals, led by a woman named Mado, who wish to obtain his secret of building a mechanical man. The criminals are captured before they are able to get them, and are brought to trial and condemned. Mado manages to escape and kidnaps the scientist's niece, forcing her to give her the blueprints which she uses to build a mechanical man. The mechanical man is used to commit a variety of crimes including murder, all controlled by Mado. The scientist's brother (Gabriel Moreau) however is successful in creating a second mechanical man which he uses to combat the original. The two mechanical men fight each other in an opera house and end up destroying each other as well as the opera house. During the final battle, Mado frantically attempts to control the mechanical man and is electrocuted at the control panel by a short circuit.

Performances that focus on the passage of long periods of time are also known as durational art or durational performances.Paul Allain, Jen Harvie, The Routledge Companion to Theatre and Performance, Routledge, 2014, p. 221. Other terms include duration art, live art or time-based art.

Other examples of endurance art include Tehching Hsieh's One Year Performance 1980–1981 (Time Clock Piece), in which for 12 months he punched a time clock every hour, and Art/Life One Year Performance 1983–1984 (Rope Piece), in which Hsieh and Linda Montano spent a year tied to each other by an eight-foot rope.Andrew Taylor, \\"Tehching Hsieh: The artist who took the punches as they came\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 30 April 2014: \\"Don't try this endurance art at home. That is Tehching Hsieh's advice to artists inspired to emulate the five year-long performances he began in the late 1970s.\\" In The House with the Ocean View (2003), Marina Abramović lived silently for 12 days without food or entertainment on a stage entirely open to the audience.Thomas McEvilley, \\"Performing the Present Tense – A recent piece by Marina Abramovic blended endurance art and Buddhist meditation,\\" Art in America, 91(4), April 2003. Such is the physical stamina required for some of her work that in 2012 she set up what she called a \\"boot camp\\" in Hudson, New York, for participants in her multiple-person performances. The Nine Confinements or The Deprivation of Liberty is a conceptual, endurance art and performative work of critical and biographical content by artist Abel Azcona. The artwork was a sequence of performances carried out between 2013 and 2016. All of the series had a theme of deprivation of liberty. The first in the series was performed by Azcona in 2013 and named Confinement in Search of Identity. The artist was to remain for sixty days in a space built inside an art gallery of Madrid, with scarce food resources and in total darkness. The performance was stopped after forty-two days for health reasons and the artist hospitalised. Azcona created these works as a reflection and also a discursive interruption of his own mental illness. Mental illness being one of the recurring themes in Azcona's work. Examples Tehching Hsieh spent a year in this cage in his studio in One Year Performance 1978–1979 (Cage Piece). * Marina AbramovićMiriam Seidel, \\"Pioneer Of Endurance Art To Give Lecture\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, 3 December 1998.

The series holds the Guinness World Record for the \\"Most participants in one race\\" (216 cars). The title is a parody of the long running annual 24 Hours of Le Mans race, and lemon cars. Teams of at least four drivers compete for up to 24 hours in race-prepared cars with a price limit, much like folkracing, of no more than US$500 for cars in the US series or NZD$999 in New Zealand. These races set themselves apart from the typical road race by the unusual penalties and punishments meted out by judges, as well as a blatant disregard for traditional motorsport politicking. The series is similar to the ChumpCar World Series which developed out of it, but retains a more carnival-like atmosphere. Event overview The event is billed as a 24-hour endurance race. The event covers a weekend, and participants endure \\"scrutiny\\" and a number of qualifiers along with the main endurance race of varying total hours, depending on the venue (including resource consent/s and Licences). The organizers state that they will attempt to run at least one true 24-hour race (continuous) every year.The 24 Hours of LeMons: FAQ & How-To accessed November 16, 2011 =History= The 24 Hours of LeMons, founded by author/editor Jay Lamm (self appointed \\"Chief Perp\\"), began in 2006 as a progression of an earlier San Francisco, California event, the Double 500, which was a 500-kilometer road rally for US$500 vehicles.24 Hours of LeMons FAQ - AREN'T YOU THOSE DOUBLE 500 GUYS? After several yearly Double 500s, the organizers deemed the event too easy, so the 24 Hours of LeMons endurance race was born. The earliest LeMons races were held at Altamont Motorsports Park and other tracks in California. The series expanded in 2008 to include events in the eastern United States, with races held in Connecticut, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas in addition to the races in California and Nevada.Series Events & Results In May 2008, a LeMons race held at Altamont Motorsports Park was struck by tragedy when the driver of one of the cars died during the race. Court Summerfield, 47, suffered a heart attack or stroke during the race and crashed into a wall. Investigations revealed that there were no malfunctions with the car and that the driver was already dead upon impact.Court Summerfield, 1961-2008 In September 2016, New Zealand hosted its inaugural LeMons event at Hampton Downs Motorsport Park in Waikato. Race Director Dr. Jacob Simonsen (the \\"Chief Lemon squeezer\\") established 24 Hours of LeMons as a Nationwide series with 3 events per year and the inclusion of a unique 24 hour \\"day/night\\" race. In 2018, 24 Hours of LeMons became New Zealand's largest participation motorsport series, with 295 drivers in one event, which was also the country's first ever continuous 24 hour motorsport race. Preparation and rules A typical LeMons racer being refueled; in this case, a Fiat 131. To enter the event, participants must find a car where purchasing and prepping the car will not exceed US$500,The 24 Hours of LeMons: Rules accessed March 30, 2007 AUD$999 and NZD$999 respectively. The name of the race alludes to the relatively low value of entrants' cars, as such vehicles might be considered \\"lemons\\". The event organizers set a complete set of safety rules that typically are on par with other road racing sanctioning bodies, including the Sports Car Club of America, National Auto Sport Association (US), Australian Auto-sport Alliance, and Motorsport New Zealand. Additions to the rules (both serious and humorous, plus rules to discourage cheating) include: * Dollar limit to prep car. This includes the purchase price of the car, any modifications made to it, and other assorted expenses (such as labor and sponsorships) are figured into the cost. Approved safety equipment (see below) plus brakes, wheels, and tires are not included in the vehicle purchase figure. * Items sold off a car can be deducted from the total spent, so it is possible to buy a more expensive car and sell off parts, or sell parts and buy better equipment. (i.e. selling off parts from a BMW or other similar luxury car to circumvent/comply with the purchase 'cap' rule.) **If the event organizers feel the car has exceeded its financial limit, they assign what is called a BSF (Bullshit Factor), where every $10 the car exceeds over the purchase price is docked one lap (BS penalties may vary in each territory). * Car must have four wheels and have been legal for highway use at its time of manufacture. * Event organizers have full rights to buy the car for the \\"purchase price limit\\" at the end of the race. Required safety equipment includes: *A six point roll cage (US), minimum half-cage with side intrusion (for New Zealand) *Full-face Snell SA2015 helmet or better *Fire extinguisher and/or fire suppression system (mandatory as of 2019 season) *Five or six point racing harness *SFI 3.2A/1 Nomex-style fire suit, fire resistant/retardant gloves, shoes and with fire retardant underwear *SFI 38.1-rated or FIA 8858-rated head and neck support. *Drivers seat must reach the middle of the helmet or higher. SFI or FIA approved seat recommended *New Zealand rules differ slightly but are based on AASA regulations Race In the US, most events are 14.5 hours long, with sessions on Saturday and Sunday running from six to ten hours long. There is usually one full 24 hour endurance race each year. In Australia and New Zealand, events average 20 hours over the 2 – 3 days. Each race begins with all cars being released onto the track under a full course yellow flag for lap-timing transponder checks. No passing is permitted under yellow, so all cars operational before the start (over 150 have been known to start) will circulate around the track in single file for up to 20 minutes until the officials are satisfied that the timing and scoring system is working properly. The race officially begins with the green flag being waved at a randomly chosen car.http://www.speedsportlife.com/2009/09/17/racer-boy-24-hours-of-lemons-or- endurace-racing-for-the-financially-and-mentally-challenged/ Standard racing flags are used by corner workers stationed around the track to communicate with drivers. The black flag is used liberally throughout the race to mandate an immediate pit stop for concerns with the driving or with the car. Driving infractions range from any contact with another vehicle or fixed barrier and overly aggressive driving to spinning or driving two wheels off of the track. Car problems that typically result in black flags are, most frequently, obvious safety problems such as any fluid leak, parts hanging off the car, or inoperative lights. Drivers must report to the penalty box immediately after being shown a black flag. Races that are split into two days will have a checkered flag at the end of the first day, signifying the end of the racing session. The race is restarted on the next day, normally with the top ten cars being permitted to line up in order with the first-place car getting the green flag. Penalties Wheel of Misfortune - Buttonwillow, CA August 15–16, 2009 LeMons officials have an idiosyncratic penalty and punishment system where penalties for some infractions are meted out by a device called The Wheel of Misfortune. Various devices may be put onto the car in order to affect car performance; one device used is metal silhouettes of various farm animals welded to the roof by the \\"Arc Angel\\" to reduce aerodynamic efficiency. Also, any car that flips in the process of the race is slapped with the \\"Why Am I Upside-Down?\\" penalty: not only is that team disqualified for the current race, but the driver who flipped the car is barred from all other races for the rest of the season. Likewise, drivers and teams might also be forced to undertake physical acts in order to satisfy punishment conditions, such as the Marcel Marceau Memorial \\"Mime Your Crime\\" penalty, where a driver must put on white face paint and a beret and mime what they did wrong. In addition, penalties are often tailored to address current events or figures where the race is run. Examples of this include the \\"Max Mosley S&M; Penalty\\", the \\"Sheriff Joe Arpaio Penalty\\" in Arizona (where drivers must don pink underwear, sit in a hot tent and eat stale bologna sandwiches, all punishments the Maricopa County sheriff has inflicted at his prisons), and the \\"Mark Sanford 'Cry For Me, Argentina' Memorial Penalty\\" at a race in South Carolina, in which a driver must write a lengthy love letter to his Argentine mistress on his car, à la the former governor of that state. All penalties are designed to waste a driver's time, while less aggressive and better drivers continue to race. Awards Car being destroyed at Altamont, 7–8 July '07 There are four main awards with one given midway through the race. Note that, in the US, all prize money is typically awarded entirely in nickels (five-cent coins). The midway award was aptly named People's Curse. One car was voted People's Curse, for being driven by the biggest jerks of the day as judged by the attending crowd. The offending car was crushed or otherwise destroyed typically by heavy equipment, but when none could be found, an angry mob with wire cutters and wrenches had been used. If there were not enough votes to destroy a car, it may have instead received nasty but non-fatal damage, or it may have been sent to the Penalty Box with a black flag. For 2013 the Curse was removed from the series. The counterpoint to the People's Curse, Organizers Choice (originally People's Choice) is awarded to the team that best represents the friendly spirit of the race. A trophy and $500 prize is given. The car that completes the most laps net of pre-race \\"BS\\" penalties is awarded the Win on Laps, and the team receives a trophy. Through 2011, the winner on laps also received a $1500 cash prize, typically in the form of nickels. The grand prize (and considered by some to be the \\"true\\" winner) is the Index of Effluency award, presented to a car considered unlikely to finish the race at all, let alone finish with a respectable number of laps completed. The team that wins the Index of Effluency is given a larger trophy and a cash prize. The prize was $1501 through 2011, and was reduced to $501 beginning in 2012; in each case, the prize is $1 more than the team could win by winning the race or their class. Prizes, trophies and awards vary depending on the territory. In the US, prior to a race, every entry is assigned into a class, A, B, C, or X. The car in each class that completes the most laps net of pre-race \\"BS\\" penalties (with the exception of the winner on laps, which was previously recognized) is awarded the class win, and the team receives a trophy. Beginning in 2012, the winners of classes A, B, and C each also receive a $500 cash prize, typically in nickels. Several other trophies are given, typically: Most Heroic Fix, I Got Screwed, Grassroots Motorsports Magazine's Most from the Least, Least (or Most) Horrible Yank Tank, and trophies to the fastest cars of the three classes. Occasionally, Judges' Choice or Dangerous Homemade Technology awards are given. At the end of each season, the organizers also recognize a group of Legends of LeMons for especially noteworthy themes, fabrication work, or other contributions to the series. Forty-one teams earned such recognition in 2009, the first year teams were so honored. In 2010, the number of teams earning \\"Legend\\" status increased to 58, but this time, four were singled out for the exceptional honor of a Unununium Medal, the next twenty were awarded a Ununquadium Medal, while the remaining 34 received a Ununhexium Medal. In 2011, the list of awards was pared down from previous seasons, as nine racers and teams were awarded a Gluon Medal for their feats.  YouTube channel  24 Hours of LeMons maintains an official channel on YouTube. The channel publishes two main kinds of videos: Lemons Wrapup videos and #lemonsworld videos. = Lemons Wrapup videos = Since mid 2012, the 24 Hours of LeMons organizers have produced a wrapup video after each race. The videos almost always cover the main LeMons awards, including the Index of Effluency, Heroic Fix, and I Got Screwed. The videos are typically organized as follows. First, hosts Jay Lamm, Nick Pon, and/or Jeff Glenn give an overview of the race while seated in chairs in front of a green screen in the studio at LeMons HQ. Then, the videos jump between the studio, track driving footage, and footage of activities in the pits. The videos conclude with \\"Lemons in a Nutshell,\\" where something particularly amusing occurs, for example a racing team is shown dancing while dressed in an outlandish costume theme.  Recurring features and expressions  * \\"Here are your winners. Nobody cares.\\": The presenters briefly display the names of the winning teams (by number of laps completed) for classes A, B, and C. * \\"This car's gonna dominate!\\": One of the LeMons staff members, often Judge Phil, points at a car before the race and says \\"This car's gonna dominate!\\" * \\"Did it dominate? It did not.\\": After the race, Jay Lamm asks \\"Did it dominate?\\" Nick Pon responds \\"it did not.\\" * \\"Hella sweet\\": Awesome. * \\"Butt turrible\\": Terrible. * \\"Racer CSI\\": Racers like to overthink why they crashed, saying esoteric things like \\"the trailing arm rear suspension goes through a camber change in that corner.\\" However, LeMons organizers shrug and say \\"you know, people crash more at the sharp corner.\\" * \\"Never listen to Judge Phil's suggestions\\": Judge Phil often points out car models that are unusual in LeMons and encourages teams to bring these models to LeMons.

The film is directed by Tod Williams, produced by John Cusack, with a screenplay by King and Adam Alleca. The film stars John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Isabelle Fuhrman. The film was released on June 10, 2016 to video on demand, prior to a limited release scheduled for July 8, 2016. Cell is the second film adaptation of a King story to co-star Cusack and Jackson, after the 2007 film 1408. The film was panned by critics upon its release; most criticized the film's acting and plot. Plot Clayton \\"Clay\\" Riddell is a disillusioned artist, who a year earlier abandoned his wife Sharon and son Johnny in hopes of living his dream of publishing a graphic novel. At Boston International Airport, Riddell tries to board a flight in hopes of reconciling with his family. His cell phone battery dies and he reconnects with Sharon by using a payphone. Suddenly an electronic signal (later dubbed \\"the pulse\\") is broadcast across mobile networks worldwide, turning cell phone users into rabid killers. Riddell escapes the chaos in the terminal, and meets a group of survivors in a subway car. The train's driver, Thomas \\"Tom\\" McCourt, suggests abandoning the train and travelling through the tunnels. Riddell agrees and, joined by a third man, attempts to escape the airport. Near the tunnel's exit, their companion is stabbed to death by an infected man, later dubbed a \\"phoner\\", and the two escape to the street above. Riddell leads Tom to his apartment. That night, they are joined by Alice Maxwell, a teenage neighbor of Riddell's who confesses that she killed her mother in self-defense. The three decide to escape Boston. Heading north through New England to find Sharon and Johnny, Riddell and the other two acquire weapons from a house, and encounter a boy who is revealed to be a phoner. He is shot and killed, but a nearby flock chases the three to a nearby river. Hiding from the infected, they observe the flock emitting mysterious signals from their mouths and then walking off as a group. After sundown, the three arrive at a private school, where they meet two survivors: former headmaster Charles Ardai and scholarship student Jordan. Discussing the turn of events, Ardai posits that the phoners have developed a hive mind and are telepathic. He reveals that hundreds of phoners are resting in the school's athletic field. Ardai has a plan to use the stadium's gas pumps and a truck to douse the group and burn them, and the others agree to help. Riddell and Tom drive over and spray the unaware phoners, who are then set ablaze by Ardai. The fire spreads and causes an explosion that kills Ardai. The remaining group, now including Jordan, continue traveling north. Taking shelter in an abandoned drive-in theater, the four sleep and all dream about a raggedy- looking man in a red hoodie. Days later, they encounter a group of survivors in a roadside bar. They tell Riddell and the others about Kashwak, a state park in Maine where there is said to be no cell service. They all decide to travel there, and spend the night in the bar. The next morning, Sally, one of the survivors, is awoken and then infected by a group outside, who can now transmit the pulse through their mouths. The group attacks Tom and Jordan. After saving Tom from a phoner, Alice is bludgeoned in the head by Sally. Tom fatally shoots Sally. The group takes Alice outside to a tree to rest, where she succumbs to her head wound. Moving on, the group encounter Ray Huizenga and Denise, who say that Kashwak is a trap set by the Raggedy Man. Ray confides in Riddell that he has planted explosives in his truck, and kills himself to stop the Raggedy Man from reading his mind. The group make it to Sharon's house, and find that Sharon has turned into a phoner. Riddell learns that Johnny has headed for Kashwak. The others continue north while Riddell drives alone to Kashwak, intent on locating Johnny. There, Riddell finds thousands of phoners walking in a large circle around a communications tower. Riddell sees the Raggedy Man and runs him over, and hears his son calling to him amongst the flock of phoners. Riddell resolves to go through with the plan, but then Johnny appears before him. Riddell hugs him as he detonates the explosives in the truck, destroying the tower and killing himself and the phoners. It is then revealed, however, that the explosion was an illusion. Riddell, in fact, has been infected and is now walking in the circle around the tower. It is also revealed that the Raggedy Man is still alive, watching over the crowd. Cast Production =Development= The film is based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Stephen King. Dimension Films announced in March 2006 that Eli Roth would direct the project after finishing Hostel: Part II. Roth exited the project in 2009, saying: Following Roth's departure, Screen Rant noted that the film \\"faded into the background\\"; however, in 2013 Tod Williams was announced as the director, which brought the film back on track. King stated that because fans did not like the ending of the book, he had changed it for the film. =Casting= John Cusack was the first actor announced to have joined the film in October 2012. Samuel L. Jackson was cast as Tom McCourt in November 2013. Isabelle Fuhrman was announced as Alice on February 5, 2014. The next day, Stacy Keach was cast in an unnamed role of a headmaster. =Filming= The film was shot over 25 days in January 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia. Release In February 2015, the producers of the film announced that Clarius Entertainment had acquired distribution rights. The company, now called Aviron Pictures, later dropped the film. Saban Films later acquired distribution rights to the film. It was to receive its world premiere at FrightFest as part of the Glasgow Film Festival but was replaced at the last minute by Pandemic. The film was released on June 10, 2016, to video on demand, prior to opening in a limited release on July 8, 2016. Reception Cell was panned by most critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 11% based on 54 reviews and an average score of 3.91/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Shoddily crafted and devoid of suspense, Cell squanders a capable cast and Stephen King's once-prescient source material on a bland rehash of zombie cliches.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times criticized the film's \\"bare-bones screenplay\\" for being \\"wholly unable to deliver even a smidgen of nuance or depth\\", and called Cusack's performance \\"possibly the most detached\\" of his career. Owen Gleiberman of Variety referred to the outbreak scene in the airport as the \\"only unsettling scene\\" in the film, and wrote that \\"the film is about as close as you could get to a generic low-budget undead thriller.\\" Steve Greene of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \\"C-\\", calling it \\"a character study with a dearth of character\\", and concluding that the film has \\"no greater message [...] except that using a Bluetooth headset to call someone from an airport bathroom stall should be punishable by zombification\\". Odie Henderson of RogerEbert.com gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, commending the performances of Cusack, Jackson, and Keach but criticizing the film's \\"occasional lack of storytelling clarity\\", calling it \\"rushed and unclear in its details about the pulse and its aftermath.\\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting called it a \\"forgettable adaptation\\" and further stated that \\"the story packs absolutely no punch and the solid stable of actors look bored for most of the film.\\" Nico Lang of Consequence of Sound wrote that Cell wasted an intriguing premise and called it \\"unnecessarily glum and grim,\\" as well as \\"pretty dumb.\\" Bob Grimm of Coachella Valley Independent wrote that the movie \\"is easily one of the worst adaptations ever of a King story.\\" References External links  Cell at Box Office Mojo  * (rating 1.5/5) 2016 films 2016 horror films 2010s science fiction horror films 2010s thriller films American films American science fiction horror films American science fiction thriller films English-language films Films based on science fiction novels Films based on works by Stephen King Films based on American horror novels Films directed by Tod Williams Films shot in Atlanta Films with screenplays by Stephen King Saban Entertainment films Films about mobile phones Horror television films ja:セル (小説)#映画 ","title":"Cell (film)"},{"id":"16093985","text":": Familia: Orchidaceae : Subfamilia: Epidendroideae : Tribus: Epidendreae : Subtribus: Pleurothallidinae : Genus: Stelis (Orchidaceae) : authority: Lindl.

In 2006, JL Racing formed a partnership with Saab Canada to race and showcase Canada's only Saab 9-3 race car.Saab Canada: Saab Canada and JL Racing enter partnership The team made headlines several times with a first-race, first- place finish and subsequent podium finishes in the Saab 9-3. The team currently competes in the Castrol Canadian Touring Car Championship. In 2008 they will enter two Saab 9-3 MY 08 cars in the Super Touring class and will run North America's first Saab 9-3 BioPower race car in the Touring Class. The team's current full-time drivers are John Lockhart, Jason Sharpe and Diane Dale.  History  =2006= The 2006 season was set as a test season for the team. The 2005 Saab 9-3 was built over the spring months and the team decided to focus on suspension and handling for the first part of the season. Horsepower would be addressed later in the year. As it was a development year, the team did not have high expectations. There were a number of challenges in the first few weekends of racing. The car didn’t enter any races, but rather, the practice sessions to get as much track time as possible. One of the biggest hurdles was the engine overheating and the removal of all guards and heat shields around the turbocharger eventually solved the problem. On July 1 Canada Day weekend the team entered the car in its first race, which they subsequently won. It was the first time Saab had won first place on its first race in North America. The team went on to enter eight races for the year and came away with four overall wins. At the end of the year, the team finished in the top ten for the CASC Ontario Touring Car GT Series. =2007= In 2007 the team entered the Castrol Canadian Touring Car Championship. The month of September saw a win at the British Empire Motor Club (BEMC) Indian Summer War Bonnet three-hour endurance race. Another record was set as it was the first time a Saab 9-3 had won an endurance race in Canada. The final weekend of racing saw the team claim fifth position for the championship.

Xangsane hit southern Luzon of the Philippines. It turned to the north over the South China Sea, and after strengthening to a 100 mph typhoon it hit Taiwan. Xangsane dissipated on Nov. 1st, after causing 181 casualties, 83 of which were from the crash of Singapore Airlines Flight 006 the previous day on October 31, 2000.  Meteorological history  On October 24, the formation of a tropical cyclone began in the waters near Palau, and on the 25th, the tropical cyclone number 30W was numbered by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). In addition, the tropical cyclone reached the surveillance area in the Philippines, so it was named Philippine name \\"Reming\\" by PAGASA. After that, 30W (Reming) was named \\"Xangsane\\". This is the name proposed by Laos and means \\"Elephant\\". Xangsane crossed Luzon, Philippines from 27th to 28th. After that, it proceeded to the South China Sea on 29th and strengthened the power to a 100 mph while changing its course to the north. Xangsane approached Taiwan from 31st to 1st November and changed to an Extratropical cyclone in the East China Sea at 12:00 (UTC) 1st November.Annual Report on Activities of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center 2000、P.42 Also, the 15th storm that approached Japan in 2000 was this Xangsane. 2000 was a rare year when the number of storms approached Japan was relatively a lot, even though there were no storms that landed in Japan.  Impact  Xangsane hit the Manila metropolitan area. Heavy winds and heavy rains were happened in Quezon, Bulacan, Zambales and Pangasinan, as well as in the Bicol region of southern Luzon. In Tayabas, Quezon, rainfall of 312.3 mm is observed per 24 hours. The storm killed 40 people, lost 100,000 homes, and caused damage of $27.45 million.Annual Tropical Cyclone Reports、P.181 In Taiwan, floods killed 59 people and cost them $500 million. On October 31, when Xangsane was approaching Taiwan, an accident of Singapore Airlines Flight 006 occurred at Zhongzheng International Airport (now Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport). Initially, it was suspected that the accident was due to the effect of Xangsane, but it was later discovered that the accident was due to a pilot error. However, some argue that this pilot error was due to poor visibility from Xangsane.

He is a founder of the Science Fiction Hall of Fame (1996) and a past president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA, 2005–2007). Life Bailey graduated from North Kansas City High School and received a B. A. in English and Anthropology and a M. A. in English Literature from Northwest Missouri State University.Diana J. Bailey, Robin's wife, 2011. He debuted as a fiction writer with the novel Frost, published by Timescape Books in 1983 and followed with two sequels and a few short stories during the next three years. Bailey's works include Shadowdance, the Frost series, The Brothers of the Dragon, and Dragonkin fantasy trilogies and Swords Against the Shadowland, a novel interpolated in the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser series of sword and sorcery stories by Fritz Leiber. A direct sequel to Leiber's most famous story \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar\\" (1970), Swords Against the Shadowland was named one of the seven best fantasy novels of 1998 by genre newszine Science Fiction Chronicle. Bailey was a finalist for the annual Nebula Award for Best Novelette for \\"The Children's Crusade\\" (2007). In conjunction with the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society (KaCSFFS) and the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas, Bailey and James Gunn founded the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 1996. The Hall of Fame later merged under a special agreement with Paul G. Allen's Vulcan Enterprises and in 2004 it became part of the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle. The hall of fame is now a part of the larger EMP Museum (named simply for \\"Experience Music Project\\", which has somewhat reduced the focus on its science fiction component). Beginning in 2013, it once again inducted people for contributions to fantasy, the original name also having been restored; Bailey continues to serve on its annual induction committee. Before serving as SFWA president (2005–2007), Bailey was SFWA South-Central Regional Director for nine years; he was also the host of three of the Association's annual Nebula Awards Weekends, including two in Kansas City.; as a result, Bailey received a special \\"Service to SFWA Award\\" in 1998.

Career Omar Pene was born in the working-class neighborhood of Derkle in Dakar. Having been singing his whole life and playing in other bands, he formed Super Diamono in 1975–76, with previous bandmates Cheikh Diagne, Bassirou Diagne, and Bazlo Diagne, along with members of Tropical Jazz De Dakar, including singer Ismael Lo. Other members of the band included Bob Sene, Aziz Seck, Lapa Diagne, Abdou Mbacke and Adama Faye, a jazz keyboardist who gave the group a harder electric sound. In Dakar during the 1980s, Super Diamono were one of the few bands who could compete with Youssou Ndour in Dakar, and the two singers had a lively artistic competition, both with devoted fanbases. Fans of Pene and Super Diamono used to congregate particularly at the Balafon Club, near the Autonomous Port of Dakar. Super Diamono's music was energetic reggae and jazz influenced dance music rooted in Senegalese mbalax rhythms, which are frenetic and syncopated. Their songs cover socially conscious topics such as unemployment and education, and they were described by Rough Guide: World Music as \\"the people's band of Dakar's proletarian suburbs\\". In the mid-1980s Ismael Lo left to follow a solo career and was replaced by Mamadou Marga. By 1991 most of the group's original members had left for other projects, and Pene continued the band with session musicians, touring Europe and North America four years later. To date, he has released more than thirty albums and cassettes. Under their new name Super Diamono de Dakar , the band released their first album Géédy Dayaan in 1979 under Griot Records (Disques Griot).Mazzoleni, Florent, L'épopée de la musique africaine: rythmes d'Afrique atlantique, Hors collection (2008), p. 81,  References  External links * Official site of Omar Pène and \\"Super Diamono\\" (In French) * Omar Pene Profile at Radio France International (RFI) Senegalese male singers People from Dakar 1956 births Living people ","title":"Omar Pene"},{"id":"16094102","text":"The Patent Reform Act may refer to: *The Patent Reform Act of 2005, an unenacted bill introduced in the 109th United States Congress *The Patent Reform Act of 2007, an unenacted bill introduced in the 110th United States Congress *The Patent Reform Act of 2009, an unenacted bill introduced in the 111th United States Congress *The Patent Reform Act of 2011, a bill introduced in the 112th United States Congress Patent reform ","title":"Patent Reform Act"},{"id":"16094107","text":"Kimberly Grace \\"Kim\\" Ruddins (born September 3, 1963 in Los Angeles, California) is a retired female volleyball player from the United States, who won the silver medal with the USA National Women's Team at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

His directorial works and screenplays often make use of improvisation techniques. Currently, Suwa is the President of Tokyo Zokei University. Biography Having graduated from Hiroshima Prefectural Hatsukaichi High School (located in Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima), Suwa studied at Tokyo Zokei University, under the tutorship of Nobuhiro Kawanaka. While at the college, he began working producing independent films, of which Hanasareru Gang was chosen for the Pia Film Festival. After graduating from Tokyo Zokei, Suwa began directing television documentary films, and worked with directors such as Sōgo Ishii and Masashi Yamamoto. In 1996, his feature film directorial debut, was released. Suwa's second film, M/Other, was released soon after in 1999, winning the prestigious FIPRESCI Prize at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival and being the subject of several other awards and critical acclaim, both in Japan and internationally. M/Other also won the award for best screenplay at the 50th Mainichi Film Awards. His assistant director in the film was Miwa Nishikawa. Suwa's third feature film, H Story (starring Kō Machida), was released in March 2000. It presents itself as an autobiographical documentary on an attempt to remake Alain Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour, and had been noted as an audacious attempt at a Nouvelle Vague portrayal of his hometown, Hiroshima.On the genre of H Story and its relations with Hiroshima non amour, see G. HAINGE, A Tale of (at least) two Hiroshimas : Nobuhiro Suwa’s H Story and Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima mon amour, Contemporary French Civilization 32, 2 (2008), p. 147-173; Id., The Reverse Atomic Principle of Hiroshima mon amour . The film is bilingual French-Japanese. Also during the same year, he guest-appeared in and co- created the Sōgo Ishii-directed samurai epic Gojoe Reisenki: GOJEI. In 2005, he directed and wrote , which featured a French cast and crew and is entirely in French. The film won the Special Prize of the Jury Award and the C.I.C.A.E. Award at the 58th Locarno Film Festival. Later, in 2006, Suwa participated in the international omnibus film Paris, je t'aime. He directed and wrote the segment representing the 2nd arrondissement, filmed at Place des Victoires. Paris, je t'aime was the opening film of the Un Certain Regard selection at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. In 2009, Suwa directed jointly with Hippolyte Girardot Yuki & Nina, another French-Japanese bilingual movie which was shot in both France and Japan.

It is a branch of the digital humanities and an extension of quantitative history, cliometrics, and computing. Digital history is commonly digital public history, concerned primarily with engaging online audiences with historical content, or, digital research methods, that further academic research. Digital history outputs include: digital archives, online presentations, data visualizations, interactive maps, time-lines, audio files, and virtual worlds to make history more accessible to the user. Recent digital history projects focus on creativity, collaboration, and technical innovation, text mining, corpus linguistics, network analysis, 3D modeling, and big data analysis. By utilizing these resources, the user can rapidly develop new analyses that can link to, extend, and bring to life existing histories.  History  Early digital history in the 1960s and 70s focused on quantitative analyses, primarily of demographic data - censuses, election returns, city directories, etc. These early computers could be programmed to conduct statistical analyses of these records, creating tallies, or seeking trends across records.Charles Dollar and Richard Jensen, Historians Guide to Statistics (1971) This research into historical demography was rooted in the rise of social history as a field of historical interest. The historians involved in this work sought to quantify past societies, to come to new conclusions about communities and population. Computers proved capable tools for that type of work. By the late 1970s younger historians turned to cultural studies, but the outpouring of quantitive studies by established scholars continued. Since then, quantitative history and cliometrics have been used primarily by historically-minded economists and political scientists. In the late 1980s quantifiers founded the Association for History and Computing. This movement provided some of the impetus for the rise of digital history in the 1990s. The more recent roots of digital history were in software rather than online networks. In 1982, the Library of Congress embarked on its Optical Disk Pilot Project, which placed text and images from its collection on to laserdiscs and CD-ROMs. The library started offering online exhibits in 1992 when it launched Selected Civil War Photographs. In 1993, Roy Rosenzweig, along with Steve Brier and Josh Brown, produced their award-winning CD-ROM Who Built America? From the Centennial Exposition of 1876 to the Great War of 1914, designed for Apple, Inc. that integrated images, text, film and sound clips, displayed in a visual interface that supported a text narrative. Among the earliest online digital history projects were The Heritage Project of the University of Kansas and medieval historian Dr. Lynn Nelson's World History Index and History Central Catalogue. Another was The Valley of the Shadow, conceived in 1991 by current University of Richmond President Edward L. Ayers, who was then at the University of Virginia. The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia adopted the Valley Project and partnered with IBM to collect and transcribe historical sources into digital files. The project collected data related to Augusta County in Virginia and Franklin County in Pennsylvania during the American Civil War. In 1996, William G. Thomas III joined Ayers on the Valley Project. Together, they produced an online article entitled \\"The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities,\\" which also appeared in the American Historical Review in 2003. A CD-ROM also accompanied the Valley Project, published by W. W. Norton and Company in 2000. Rosenzweig, who died October 11, 2007, founded the Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University in 1994. Today, CHNM boasts several digital tools available to historians, such as Zotero, Omeka or Tropy. In 1997, Ayers and Thomas used the term \\"digital history\\" when they proposed and founded the Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH) at the University of Virginia, the earliest center devoted exclusively to history. Several other institutions promoting digital history include the Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online (MATRIX) at Michigan State University, Maryland's Institute for Technology in the Humanities, and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska. In 2004, Emory University launched Southern Spaces, a \\"peer-reviewed Internet journal and scholarly forum\\" examining the history of the South.  Applications  There are many potential benefits to the use of digital history when combined with traditional historical methods. Some of these applications include: * Combining traditional historical methods and new research methods in order to come to new conclusions. * Using different tools to extract and analyse larger amounts of data that would not be manageable otherwise. * Create models and maps of data extracted to create a visualisation of the data. * Data extracted and analysed can be placed alongside existing historiography to increase combined historical knowledge. By adding new research methods to existing historical method, historians can benefit greatly from the ability to work with larger amounts of data and develop new interpretations from this.  Notable projects  ICIC archives, showing thousands of documents exchanged between League of Nations experts during the interwar period. The collaborative nature of most digital history endeavors has meant that the discipline has developed primarily at institutions with the resources to sponsor content research and technical innovation. Two of the first centers, George Mason University's Center for History and New Media and the Virginia Center for Digital History at the University of Virginia have been among the leaders in the development of digital history projects and the education of digital historians. Some of the noteworthy projects emerging from these pioneering centers are The Geography of Slavery, The Texas Slavery Project, and The Countryside Transformed at VCDH and Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution and The Lost Museum at the CHNM. In each of these projects, mediated archives holding multiple types of sources are combined with digital tools to analyze and illuminate an historical question to a varying degree; this integration of content and tools with analysis is one of the hallmarks of digital history—projects move beyond archives or collections and into scholarly analysis and the use of digital tools to develop that analysis. The differences between the ways projects incorporate these integrations are a measure of the development of the field and point to the ongoing debates over what digital history can and should be. While many of the projects at VCDH, CHNM, and other university's centers have been geared towards academics and post-secondary education, the University of Victoria (British Columbia), in conjunction with the Université de Sherbrooke and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, has created as series of projects for all ages, \\"Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History.\\" Laden with instructional aids, this site asks teachers to introduce students to historical research methods to help them develop analytical skills and a sense of the complexities of their national history. Issues of race, religion, and gender are addressed in carefully constructed modules that cover incidents in Canadian history from Viking exploration through the 1920s. One of the original co-creators of the project, John Lutz has also developed Victoria's Victoria with the University of Victoria and Malaspina University-College. In addition to Ayers, Thomas, Lutz, and Rosenzweig, numerous other individual scholars work with digital history techniques and have made and/or continue to make important contributions to the field. Robert Darnton's 2000 article, \\"An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris\\" was supplemented with electronic resources and is an early model of the discussions around digital history and its future in the humanities. One of the first major digital projects to be reviewed by the American Historical Review (AHR) was Philip Ethington's \\"Los Angeles and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110906051946/http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/LAS/history/historylab/LAPUHK/index.html—a multimedia exploration of changes to Los Angeles' physical profile over the course of several decades.

Mellon Professor of World History at the University of Pittsburgh, developed the CD-ROM project \\"Migration in Modern World History, 1500-2000.\\" In the \\"African Slave Demography Project,\\" Manning created a demographic simulation of the slave trade to show precisely how declined in West and Central Africa between 1730 and 1850 as well as in East Africa between the years 1820 and 1890 due to slavery.Manning, Patrick. 2007. Digital World History: An Agenda. Digital History portal, Department of History, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, available at http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/essays/manningessay.php. Jan Reiff, of UCLA, co-edited the print and online versions of the Encyclopedia of Chicago. Andrew J. Torget, founded the Texas Slavery Project while at VCDH and continues to develop the site as he completes his PhD—likely a model for new digital scholars who will incorporate digital components into larger research agendas. Another notable project that makes use of digital tools for historical practice is The Quilt Index.Kornbluh, Mark. 2008. From Digital Repositories to Information Habitats: H-Net, the Quilt Index, Cyber Infrastructure, and Digital Humanities. First Monday 13(8): available at http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/2230/2019 As scholars became increasingly interested in women's history, quilts became valuable to study. The Quilt Index is an online collaborative database where quilt owners can upload pictures and data about their quilts. This project was created due to the difficulty of collecting quilts. Firstly, they were in the possession of various institutions, archives, and even civilians. And secondly, they can be too fragile or bulky for physical transport. Also in the field of women's history is Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution. which highlights the collective action and individual achievements of women from the 1940s to the present.Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution. In the UK, a pilot project began in 2002 to create a digital library of British History. This has developed into an extensive collection of over 1,200 volumes, bringing together primary and secondary sources from libraries, archives, museums and academics. Another significant project is the Old Bailey Online, a digital collection of all proceedings between 1674 and 1913. In addition to the digitized records, the Old Bailey Online website provides historical and legal background information, research guides, and educational resources for students.  Digital history classes  Digital history is now a common course type in graduate and undergraduate curriculum. For example, the students in Digital History courses at the University of Hertfordshire have learned skills in digital mapping and Python programming, which makes it more accessible and easier to analyse large quantities of source data. One project that the class worked on included analyzing the trends, patterns, and relationships of data related to weather, crime, and poverty. This allowed students to use their traditional history skills to evaluate the significance of their findings. Another project was using digital mapping to compare the differences between various groups of students who studied at Oxford derived from British History Online. Similarly, at Cal State East Bay, history majors meet in the science building's computer lab to go over new and old software that could be used for the creation or presentation of history.  Technology  Digital technology tools arrange ideas and promote the unique analysis of data, with many tools previously unavailable to historians opening new avenues for collaboration, text mining, and big data analysis. In addition, digital history offers tools for the presentation and access to historical knowledge online. Digital historians may use web development tools, such as WYSIWYG HTML-editor Adobe Dreamweaver. Other tools create more interactive digital history, such as Databases, which provide greater capacity for information storage and retrieval in a definable way. Databases with features like Structured Query Language (SQL) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) arrange materials in a formal manner and allow precise searching for keywords, dates, and other data characteristics. The online article \\"The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities\\" used XML for presenting and connecting evidence with detailed historiographical discussions. The Valley of the Shadow project also employed XML to convert all of the archive's letters, diaries, and newspapers for full text searching capabilities. Coding languages such as Python may be used in order to digitally sort and filter data, whilst Google Fusion Tables can be used for the geographical mapping of data. Digital historians may use content management systems (CSM) to store their digital collection that includes audio, visual, images and text for an online web display. Examples of these systems include: Drupal, WordPress, and Omeka.Dean Rehberger. \\"Getting Oral History Online: Collections Management Applications.\\" Oral History Review 40, no. 1 (2013): 83-94. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed February 12, 2017). The Differences Slavery Made also used geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze and understand the spatial arrangement of social structures. For the article, Ayers and Thomas created many new maps through GIS technology to produce detailed images of Augusta and Franklin counties never before possible. GIS and its many components remain helpful for studying history and visualizing change over time. The Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information in unLike Environments (SIMILE) project at MIT develops robust, open source tools that enable access, management, and envisaging digital assets. Among the many tools built by SIMILE, the Timeline tool, which employs a DHTML-based AJAXy widget, allows digital historians to create dynamic, customizable timelines for visualizing time-based events. The Timeline page on the SIMILE website declares that their tool \\"is like Google Maps for time-based information.\\" Additionally, SIMILE's Exhibit tool boasts a customizable structure for sorting and presenting data.https://web.archive.org/web/20100605063616/http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/t-reviews/exhibitgant.html Exhibit, written in JavaScript, creates interactive, data-rich web pages without the need for any programming or database creation knowledge. Textual analysis software allows historians to make new use of old sources by finding patterns in large collections of documents or even just analyzing a source for frequency of terms. Textual analysis software allows historians to \\"text mine\\", or easily find correlations and themes in the documents. There are several textual-analysis programs available online, from sophisticated ones that allow the researcher to tailor the program to handle large amounts of data, like MALLET, and straightforward programs like TokenX, which generates word-frequency lists and word clouds to illustrate language usage and significance, to basic ones like Wordle, which offers simple visualizations of word frequency and relationships. Some websites provide textual analysis on their content automatically. Online bookmarking and research tool del.icio.us uses tag clouds to visually depict the frequency and importance of user- generated tags, and the recently instituted Google Ngram Viewer allows viewers to search the commonality of textual themes by year. However, with the development of digital history and the technology used to produce it, there has been questions raised over the validity of it. One such issue, is that raised by Jean Francois Baudrillard. He says that \\"Western Culture introduced significant modifications to the way it produced the real, by intensifying it and heightening it into a domain of reality in hyperspace: hyper-reality\\".Mike Gane, Jean Baudrillard: In Radical Uncertainty (Pluto Press, 2000), p. 34.

Born in Los Angeles, Toley graduated from Los Angeles High School and attended the University of Miami before returning to his hometown and graduating from USC in 1942 with a degree in Education. He was a nationally ranked tennis player during his college years, rising as high as 7th and 10th in doubles in 1939 and 1940 with partner, Gardnar Mulloy, and 20th in singles from 1940 to 1942. In 1941-42, Toley served for a brief time as a USC tennis coach, and also as a club pro at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club.

Josh Lambert writes that Remember Me To God was \\"hailed on publication as one of the finest novels ever written about American Jews and remained on the New York Times bestseller list for an entire year, almost no one remembers it today.\\" Kaufmann's second novel, Thy Daughter's Nakedness, appeared in 1968, and when his third, The Love of Elspeth Baker was published in 1982, the New York Times called him \\"a man who takes his time.\\" The later novels did not live up to the promise of the first. Early life Kaufmann was raised in Belmont, Massachusetts. As a boy, he composed serial adventure stories to entertain his classmates. He was valedictorian of his Belmont High School graduating class. He attended Harvard University with a concentration in biochemistry. After graduating in 1943, he entered the U.S. Army where he was trained as a Japanese translator. Critical reception of \\"Remember Me to God\\" Kaufmann's novel is set at Harvard. It deals with identity, assimilation, and the struggle of the son of Jewish immigrants to enter American society. At the time of his 25th Harvard reunion, he wrote: > \\"The existence of a vigorous orthodox Jewish community on the Harvard campus > was inconceivable in our time. About two years ago I walked in on a group of > Harvard students on an ordinary sabbath eve. As soon as ten were present, a > service began. There followed a kosher dinner until someone began the grace- > after-meals. After that psalms were sung in the original tongue. ... For the > past few years Kosher TV dinners have been available in the House dining > halls upon a surcharge of fifty cents ... how impossible it was twenty-five > years ago for all this to exist—how impossible it was to believe it ever > could exist. We had not the skill, we had not the knowledge. We had not the > will.\\" Critic Louis Harap considers Remember Me To God to be \\"a memorable treatment of the problem\\" of Jewish identity and assimilation in America. Today, the novel is perhaps as widely read by sociologists and historians of the American Jewish experience, as by literary critics. Sociologist Richard Alba writes: > \\"The second generation found a much more complex situation. Many of them > believed they heard the siren call of welcome to the social cliques, clubs, > and institutions of white Protestant America. After all, it was simply a > matter of learning American ways, was it not, and had they not grown up as > Americans and were they not culturally different from their parents, the > greenhorns?

Early life and education He was born in 1739, the son of Louis Mathieu de Balatier de Mas, a counselour of the parliament of Aix in Provence, and Anne Cécile d´Estienne Blégier. He was the only surviving son of seven children. Marriage and family In 1767 he married Anne Marie de Perier de la Garde, with whom he had eight children.PAUL-FRANCOIS-IGNACE, BARLATIER DE MAS, CAPITAINE DES VAISSEAUX DU ROY. LYON, A. REY, 1918.

A and B. A, D, B, C form a harmonic range. KLMN is a complete quadrangle generating it. In projective geometry, the harmonic conjugate point of an ordered triple of points on the real projective line is defined by the following construction: :Given three collinear points A, B, C, let L be a point not lying on their join and let any line through C meet LA, LB at M, N respectively. If AN and BM meet at K, and LK meets AB at D, then D is called the harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A, B.R. L. Goodstein & E. J. F. Primrose (1953) Axiomatic Projective Geometry, University College Leicester (publisher). This text follows synthetic geometry. Harmonic construction on page 11 The point D does not depend on what point L is taken initially, nor upon what line through C is used to find M and N. This fact follows from Desargues theorem. In real projective geometry, harmonic conjugacy can also be defined in terms of the cross-ratio as . Cross-ratio criterion The four points are sometimes called a harmonic range (on the real projective line) as it is found that D always divides the segment AB internally in the same proportion as C divides AB externally. That is: :{AC}:{BC} = {AD}:{DB} \\\\, . If these segments are now endowed with the ordinary metric interpretation of real numbers they will be signed and form a double proportion known as the cross ratio (sometimes double ratio) :(A,B;C,D) = \\\\frac {AC}{AD} \\\\left/ \\\\frac {BC}{-DB} \\\\right. , for which a harmonic range is characterized by a value of −1\\\\. We therefore write: :(A,B;C,D) = \\\\frac {AC}{AD} \\\\cdot \\\\frac {BD}{BC} = -1 . The value of a cross ratio in general is not unique, as it depends on the order of selection of segments (and there are six such selections possible). But for a harmonic range in particular there are just three values of cross ratio: since −1 is self-inverse – so exchanging the last two points merely reciprocates each of these values but produces no new value, and is known classically as the harmonic cross-ratio. In terms of a double ratio, given points a and b on an affine line, the division ratioDirk Struik (1953) Lectures on Analytic and Projective Geometry, page 7 of a point x is :t(x) = \\\\frac {x - a} {x - b} . Note that when , then t(x) is negative, and that it is positive outside of the interval. The cross-ratio is a ratio of division ratios, or a double ratio. Setting the double ratio to minus one means that when , then c and d are harmonic conjugates with respect to a and b. So the division ratio criterion is that they be additive inverses. Harmonic division of a line segment is a special case of Apollonius' definition of the circle. In some school studies the configuration of a harmonic range is called harmonic division. Of midpoint Midpoint and infinity are harmonic conjugates. When x is the midpoint of the segment from a to b, then :t(x) = \\\\frac {x-a} {x-b} = -1. By the cross-ratio criterion, the harmonic conjugate of x will be y when . But there is no finite solution for y on the line through a and b. Nevertheless, :\\\\lim_{y \\\\to \\\\infty} t(y) = 1, thus motivating inclusion of a point at infinity in the projective line. This point at infinity serves as the harmonic conjugate of the midpoint x. From complete quadrangle Another approach to the harmonic conjugate is through the concept of a complete quadrangle such as KLMN in the above diagram. Based on four points, the complete quadrangle has pairs of opposite sides and diagonals. In the expression of harmonic conjugates by H. S. M. Coxeter, the diagonals are considered a pair of opposite sides: :D is the harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A and B, which means that there is a quadrangle IJKL such that one pair of opposite sides intersect at A, and a second pair at B, while the third pair meet AB at C and D.H. S. M. Coxeter (1942) Non-Euclidean Geometry, page 29, University of Toronto Press It was Karl von Staudt that first used the harmonic conjugate as the basis for projective geometry independent of metric considerations: :...Staudt succeeded in freeing projective geometry from elementary geometry. In his Geometrie der Lage Staudt introduced a harmonic quadruple of elements independently of the concept of the cross ratio following a purely projective route, using a complete quadrangle or quadrilateral.B.L. Laptev & B.A. Rozenfel'd (1996) Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry, page 41, Birkhäuser Verlag P_1 = A,\\\\ P_2 = S, P_3 = B,\\\\ P_4 = Q, D = M; (ignore green M). To see the complete quadrangle applied to obtaining the midpoint, consider the following passage from J. W. Young: :If two arbitrary lines AQ and AS are drawn through A and lines BS and BQ are drawn through B parallel to AQ and AS respectively, the lines AQ and SB meet, by definition, in a point R at infinity, while AS and QB meet by definition in a point P at infinity. The complete quadrilateral PQRS then has two diagonal points at A and B, while the remaining pair of opposite sides pass through M and the point at infinity on AB. The point M is then by construction the harmonic conjugate of the point at infinity on AB with respect to A and B. On the other hand, that M is the midpoint of the segment AB follows from the familiar proposition that the diagonals of a parallelogram (PQRS) bisect each other.John Wesley Young (1930) Projective Geometry, page 85, Mathematical Association of America, Chicago: Open Court Publishing =Quaternary relations= Four ordered points on a projective range are called harmonic points when there is a tetrastigm in the plane such that the first and third are codots and the other two points are on the connectors of the third codot.G. B. Halsted (1906) Synthetic Projective Geometry, pages 15 & 16 If p is a point not on a straight with harmonic points, the joins of p with the points are harmonic straights. Similarly, if the axis of a pencil of planes is skew to a straight with harmonic points, the planes on the points are harmonic planes. A set of four in such a relation has been called a harmonic quadruple.Luis Santaló (1966) Geometría proyectiva, page 166, Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires Projective conics A conic in the projective plane is a curve C that has the following property: If P is a point not on C, and if a variable line through P meets C at points A and B, then the variable harmonic conjugate of P with respect to A and B traces out a line. The point P is called the pole of that line of harmonic conjugates, and this line is called the polar line of P with respect to the conic. See the article Pole and polar for more details. =Inversive geometry= In the case where the conic is a circle, on the extended diameters of the circle, harmonic conjugates with respect to the circle are inverses in a circle. This fact follows from one of Smogorzhevsky's theorems:A.S. Smogorzhevsky (1982) Lobachevskian Geometry, Mir Publishers, Moscow :If circles k and q are mutually orthogonal, then a straight line passing through the center of k and intersecting q, does so at points symmetrical with respect to k. That is, if the line is an extended diameter of k, then the intersections with q are harmonic conjugates. Galois tetrads In Galois geometry over a Galois field GF(q) a line has q + 1 points, where ∞ = (1,0). In this line four points form a harmonic tetrad when two harmonically separate the others. The condition :(c, d; a, b) = -1, \\\\ \\\\text{ equivalently } \\\\ \\\\ 2 (c d + a b) = (c + d) (a + b), characterizes harmonic tetrads. Attention to these tetrads led Jean Dieudonné to his delineation of some accidental isomorphisms of the projective linear groups PGL(2, q) for q = 5, 7, and 9.Jean Dieudonné (1954) \\"Les Isomorphisms exceptionnals entre les groups classiques finis\\", Canadian Journal of Mathematics 6: 305 to 15 If q = 2n, then the harmonic conjugate of C is itself.Emil Artin (1957) Geometric Algebra, page 82 Iterated projective harmonic conjugates and the golden ratio Let P_0,P_1,P_2 be three different points on the real projective line. Consider the infinite sequence of points P_n, where P_n is the harmonic conjugate of P_{n-3} with respect to P_{n-1},P_{n-2} for n>2. This sequence is convergent.F. Leitenberger (2016) Iterated harmonic divisions and the golden ratio, Forum Geometricorum 16: 429–430 For a finite limit P we have :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{P_{n+1}P}{P_{n}P}=\\\\Phi-2=-\\\\Phi^{-2} = -\\\\frac{3-\\\\sqrt{5}}{2}, where \\\\Phi=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\\\\sqrt{5}) is the golden ratio, i.e. P_{n+1}P\\\\approx -\\\\Phi^{-2} P_{n}P for large n. For an infinite limit we have :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{P_{n+2}P_{n+1}}{P_{n+1}P_{n}}=-1-\\\\Phi =-\\\\Phi^{2}. For a proof consider the projective isomorphism :f(z)=\\\\frac{az+b}{cz+d} with :f \\\\left ((-1)^n\\\\Phi^{2n} \\\\right )=P_n.

Lemmon is credited with starting the Western South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, helping the Chicago Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad - a predecessor of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad - through South Dakota, and founding a town along that railroad named Lemmon, South Dakota. He was also a prolific writer who preserved a firsthand account of the history of the western United States. Early years Lemmon was born at Bountiful, Utah. He began his days of working as a cowhand when he was twelve or thirteen years old. He worked as a cowhand and foreman for many different ranches in the Great Plains region. Lemmon began managing the Sheidley Cattle Company in 1891, and in 1893 sold his shares of the company and went into business with Richard Lake and Thomas Tomb. Later years While selling cattle in Chicago every year, Lemmon got to know many important members of the city, including the director of CM&SP; Railroad, R. M. Calkins. Calkins then asked Lemmon to help with a route for the railroad coming through South Dakota. Lemmon then picked a route from Mobridge, South Dakota through the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. He founded a town on the west side of the reservation. In honor of Lemmon, Calkins named the railroad town \\"Lemmon\\". The original site that Lemmon chose for the town was four miles east of its present location and into North Dakota. North Dakota having prohibition laws against saloons, Lemmon chose to locate the town just on the South Dakota-North Dakota border, thinking that this would help it in becoming a boom town. Also being on the border, Lemmon hoped to hold a dual county seat in Perkins County, South Dakota and Adams County, North Dakota. This never came about, but Lemmon is the largest city in present-day Perkins County. In his later years, Lemmon spent much of his time recording his life’s tales by publishing story articles in the Belle Fourche Bee, in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, every week. He started writing the stories in 1932 and kept writing until the 1940s. These weekly stories were compiled into a book by Phyllis Schmidt, titled The West As I Lived It. Lemmon died on August 25, 1945, in the town he founded.

They may contain what is found on a physical HDD, such as disk partitions and a file system, which in turn can contain files and folders. They are typically used as the hard disk of a virtual machine, are built into modern versions of Windows, and are the native file format for Microsofts hypervisor (virtual machine system), Hyper-V. The format was created by Connectix for their Virtual PC product, known as Microsoft Virtual PC since Microsoft acquired Connectix in 2003. VHDx was introduced subsequently to add features and flexibility missing in VHD that had become apparent over time. Since June 2005, Microsoft has made the VHD and VHDx Image Format Specifications available to third parties under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise.  Features  A Virtual Hard Disk allows multiple operating systems to reside on a single host machine. This method enables developers to test software on different operating systems without the cost or hassle of installing a second hard disk or partitioning a single hard disk into multiple volumes. The ability to directly modify a virtual machine's hard disk from a host server supports many applications, including: * Moving files between a VHD and the host file system * Backup and recovery * Antivirus and security * Image management and patching * Disk conversion (physical to virtual, and vice versa) * Life-cycle management and provisioning (re) VHDX was added in Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 to add larger storage capacity, data corruption protection, and optimizations to prevent performance degradation on large-sector physical disks. = Supported formats = VHDs are implemented as files that reside on the native host file system. The following types of VHD formats are supported by Microsoft Virtual PC and Virtual Server: * Fixed hard disk image: a file that is allocated to the size of the virtual disk. Fixed VHDs consist of a raw disk image followed by a VHD footer (512 or formerly 511 bytes). * Dynamic hard disk image: a file that at any given time is as large as the actual data written to it, plus the size of the header and footer. Dynamic and differencing VHDs begin with a copy of the VHD footer (padded to 512 bytes), and for dynamic or differencing VHDs created by Microsoft products this results in a VHD-cookie string conectix at the beginning of the VHD file. * Differencing hard disk image: a set of modified blocks (maintained in a separate file referred to as the \\"child image\\") in comparison to a parent image. The Differencing hard disk image format allows the concept of Undo Changes: when enabled, all changes to a hard drive contained within a VHD (the parent image) are stored in a separate file (the child image). Options are available to undo the changes to the VHD, or to merge them permanently into the VHD. Different child images based on the same parent image also allow \\"cloning\\" of VHDs; at least the globally unique identifier (GUID) must be different. * Linked to a hard disk (aka pass- through): a file that contains a link to a physical hard drive or partition of a physical hard drive. = Advantages = Significant benefits result from the ability to boot a physical computer from a virtual hard drive: * Ease of deployment: IT organizations can deploy standardized, 'pre-built' configurations on a single VHD. As an example, software engineering organizations that need a specific set of tools for a particular project could simply 'pull' the appropriately-configured VHD from a network location. * Backup-and-Restore: Changes to the contents of a VHD (such as infection by a virus, or accidental deletion of critical files) are easily undone. * Multi- User Isolation: Many current operating systems support having multiple users, but offer varying degrees of protection between them (e.g., one user of the OS could become infected by a virus that infects other users, or make changes to the OS that affect other users). By giving each user their own version of the operating system—say, by creating for each of them a differencing VHD based on a base installation of the OS—changes to any particular child image would have no effect on any of the other child images. = Native VHD Boot = Native VHD Boot refers to the ability of a physical computer to mount and boot from an operating system contained within a VHD. Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate editions support this ability, both with and without a host operating system present. Windows Server 2008 R2 is also compatible with this feature. = Limitations = The VHD format has a built-in limitation of just under 2 TiB (2040 GiB) for the size of any dynamic or differencing VHDs. This is due to a sector offset table that only allows for the maximum of a 32-bit quantity. It is calculated by multiplying 232 by 512 bytes for each sector. The formula in the VHD specification allows a maximum of sectors. About 127 GiB is also the limit for VHDs in Windows Virtual PC. For fewer than sectors (about 31 GiB) the CHS-value in the VHD footer uses a minimum of and a maximum of heads with sectors per track. The CHS algorithm then determines . The specification does not discuss cases where the CHS value in the VHD footer does not match the (virtual) CHS geometry in the Master Boot Record of the disk image in the VHD. Microsoft Virtual Server (also Connectix derived) has this limitation using virtual IDE drivers but 2 TiB if virtual RAID or virtual SCSI drivers are used.  Software support  Virtual Hard Disk format was initially used only by Microsoft Virtual PC (and Microsoft Virtual Server). Later however, Microsoft used the VHD format in Hyper-V, the hypervisor-based virtualization technology of Windows Server 2008. Microsoft also used the format in Complete PC Backup, a backup software component included with Windows Vista and Windows 7. In addition, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 include support for creating, mounting, and booting from VHD files. The Vista (or later) drive manager GUI supports a subset of the functions in the diskpart command line tool. VHDs known as vdisk in diskpart can be created, formatted, attached (mounted), detached (unmounted), merged (for differencing VHDs), and compacted (for VHDs on an NTFS host file system). Compacting is typically a two step procedure, first unused sectors in the VHD are filled with zeros, . The virtual machine additions in older VPC versions and the virtual machine integration features in Windows Virtual PC contain precompact ISO images for the first step in supported guest systems. Third-party products also use VHD file format. Oracle VirtualBox, part of Sun xVM line of Sun Microsystems supports VHD in versions 2 and later. In 2017 Red Gate Software and Windocks introduced VHD based support for SQL Server database cloning. = Offline modification = It is sometimes useful to modify a VHD file without booting an operating system. Hyper-V features offline VHD manipulation, providing administrators with the ability to securely access files within a VHD without having to instantiate a virtual machine. This provides administrators with granular access to VHDs and the ability to perform some management tasks offline. The Windows Disk Management MMC plugin can directly mount a VHD file as a drive letter in Windows 7/Server 2008 and newer. For situations where mounting a VHD within the operating system is undesirable, several programs enable software developers to inspect and modify VHD files, including .NET DiscUtils, WinImage, and R1soft Hyper-V VHD Explorer. 7-Zip supports extraction and inspection of VHD files.  Virtual Floppy Disk (VFD)  Virtual Floppy Disk (VFD) is a related file format used by Microsoft Virtual PC, Microsoft Automated Deployment Services and Microsoft Virtual Server 2005. A VFD that contains an image of a 720 KB low-density, 1.44 MB high-density or 1.68 MB DMF 3.5-inch floppy disk can be mounted by Virtual PC. Other virtual machine software such as VMWare Workstation and VMware Player can mount raw floppy images in the same way. Windows Virtual PC for Windows 7 (version 6.1) does not offer a user interface for manipulating virtual floppy disks; however, it still supports physical and virtual floppy disks via scripting. Under Hyper-V, VFD files are usable through the VM settings for Generation 1 virtual machines. Generation 2 virtual machines do not emulate a floppy controller and do not support floppy disk images.

In September 2008, The U.S. Department of the Treasury accused Rodriguez Chacín of materially assisting FARC's narcotics trafficking activities; the Venezuelan government said he was not guilty of those charges. US intelligence officials claimed that in an email between Rodriguez Chacín and the FARC leadership that he asked to train Venezuela's military in guerrilla tactics as preparation in case the United States invades. They also claimed that regarding an alleged 250 million dollar Venezuelan loan to buy weapons, Rodriguez Chacín wrote: \\"don't think of it as a loan, think of it as solidarity\\". The source for these documents was allegedly a 2008 cross-border raid by Colombian military into Ecuador which destroyed a FARC camp. Venezuelan Ambassador to the United States Bernardo Alvarez stated, \\"We don't recognized the validity of any of these documents... They are false, and an attempt to discredit the Venezuelan government.\\" In 2008, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned three current or former Venezuelan government officials, including Rodríguez, saying there was evidence they had materially helped the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in the illegal drug trade.

Because of the suspension of the Constitution Ubi periculum by Adrian V in 1276, this election was technically, perhaps, not a papal conclave. In fact, for the first time since the tedious Election of 1268–1271, the meetings were dominated neither by the Hohenstaufen nor Charles I of Naples (who had died on January 7, 1285). It may even be that the cardinals proceeded so swiftly to an election with the intention of forestalling any intervention from Naples. Participants Pope Martin IV, who was living at Perugia, never having visited the city of Rome, was stricken ill with a slow fever on Easter Sunday, March 25, and died on March 28, 1285. At that time, there were 18 living cardinals in the Sacred College, though three of them were away as Legates and were not notified in time.

This was according to the ancient custom, rather than the Constitution \\"Ubi Periculum\\" (1274) of Pope Gregory X. In the first scrutiny on the following day, they unanimously elected Cardinal Giacomo Savelli, prior Diacanorum of the College of Cardinals. Although he was already 75 years old, Savelli accepted his election and took the name of Honorius IV. His election and acceptance were even more surprising since he was suffering from a severe case of arthritis. He could only get around on crutches, and he had to have a special chair designed for him so that he could be seated at the altar during Mass, and have his arm supported so that he could raise the host at the consecration. He left Perugia for Rome at some point after April 25, 1285, where his election had been welcomed because he was a leading aristocrat of the Eternal City. His father had been Senator of Rome in 1266. He took up residence at the family estate on the Aventine Hill, next to the Church of Santa Sabina.His predecessor Martin IV (Simon de Brion) was French, and he was not able to visit Rome during his ponticate because of the enmity of Romans who were led by committed Ghibbelines. See Robert Brentano, Rome before Avignon: A Social History of Thirteenth Century Rome (Berkeley-Los Angeles: U. California 1974), pp. 143-144, 183-184. On May 19 the new Pope was ordained to the priesthood in the Vatican Basilica. On the following day, he was consecrated bishop by Cardinal- Bishop of Ostia Latino Malabranca Orsini and solemnly crowned by Cardinal Goffredo da Alatri, who became new protodeacon of the Sacred College.

History  Opened in 1925 as the Hillsboro Theatre by M.A. Lightman Sr. of Malco Theatres and his father Joseph Lightman as a silent movie house, boasting the most modern projection equipment and the largest stage in the city. The first film shown was America by D. W. Griffith. As the community grew, the Belcourt adapted to the new needs of the neighborhood by providing a regular home for two highly successful performance groups. Nashville Children's Theatre, the longest running children's theatre of its kind, and the venerable Grand Ole Opry both shared the Belcourt stage during the 1930s. The Opry's tenure from 1934 to 1936 shaped the format the radio show still uses today. Due to the intimate size of the room, the Opry began playing each show to two separate audiences. Performers found themselves playing two 15-minute performances rather than the single half-hour performance to which they were accustomed. In November 2007, the theatre was purchased by a nonprofit coalition of local arts activists (operating as \\"Belcourt Theatre Inc.\\") for $1.4 million. In September 2015, the Belcourt Campaign was announced to renovate the theatre. On December 24 of that same year, the theatre was closed for renovation, and it reopened on July 22, 2016.  Today  The Belcourt is Nashville's nonprofit film center with a stated mission \\"to engage, enrich and educate through innovative film programming in our historic theatre, our community, and beyond.\\" Its programming spans first- run (new releases) independent and documentary films (both U.S.-made and international) and repertory classics. Its concession stand includes classic movie snacks, locally-made baked goods and items like tamales and empanadas, and a full bar (including wine on tap and local craft/draft beers). The Belcourt also has an active education and engagement program, sharing films with young people throughout Middle Tennessee via its Mobile Movie Theatre and frequently hosting post-screening discussions with filmmakers, issue experts, and other special guests. The Belcourt reopened in July 2016 after undergoing seven months of renovations. The renovation increases the theatre's square- footage to include a new small screening room, classroom space for film education and outreach, an elevator, and larger fully accessible restrooms. The Belcourt is currently home to one of the largest paintings by noted painter Harry Underwood. The 4'x6' painting, Landmark Preservation, is a commentary on the uncertainty created when rapidly developing cities start to demolish historical buildings in order to make room for new construction.

He served as Chairman of the Presidium of the State Little Khural (titular head of state) of the Mongolian People's Republic from 1936 until he was purged in 1939. Early life and career Dogsom was born in 1884 in present-day Bayan-Ovoo district of Khentii Province. Literate at an early age, he first worked as a scribe in his district and provincial assemblies, and then at the ministry of finance during the Bogd Khaanate. In 1915 he participated as a scribe in negotiations that led to the Treaty of Kyakhta. =Outer Mongolian revolution of 1921= In 1919 Dogsom joined the revolutionary resistance group Züün Khüree (East Khüree), which counted Soliin Danzan and Damdin Sükhbaatar among its members. On June 25, 1920,Kh. Choibalsan, D. Losol, D. Demid, Mongolyn ardyn ündesnii khuv'sgal ankh üüseg baiguulagdsan tovch tüükh [A short history of the Mongolian revolution] (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), v. 1, p. 56. Züün Khüree merged with the Konsulyn Denj group (Dambyn Chagdarjav, Darizavyn Losol, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, and Dogsomyn Bodoo) to become the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP), later renamed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in 1924. He was one of seven original revolutionaries, \\"the first seven\\", to travel to the Soviet Russia in 1920 to establish first contacts with the Bolsheviks and seek assistance with their revolutionary struggle. In advance of the revolution, Dogsom and Bodoo returned to Khüree, where they worked to enlarge the party's membership and form an army. After the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921 Dogsom held a series of positions within the revolutionary government including in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of War, the MPP Central Committee, and the Economic Council. He was a counselor in the border districts of Khovd Province (1924-1926), First Secretary at the Mongolian Embassy in Moscow (1926-1927), again counselor at Altanbulag (1928-1929), Director of the Revolutionary Museum and Mayor of Ulaanbaatar from 1930 to 1932, and then Mongolia's representative to Tuvan People's Republic from 1933 to 1934. In February–March 1936, Dogsom was elected to the Presidium (or Politburo) of the MPRP Central Committee and concurrently as Chairman of the Little Khural, making him titular head of state. Purge Shortly after becoming Chairman of the Little Khural in 1936, Dogsom and Prime Minister Anandyn Amar aggravated Interior Minister Choibalsan and Moscow alike when they pardoned prisoners implicated in the Lkhümbe spy ring case in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of the revolution. Dogsom's enemies, particularly Choibalsan, used the event to connect him to the fictitious spy ring and accuse him of being in league with Japanese imperialists. In July 1939 as the Stalinist repressions in Mongolia drew to a close, Choibalsan arranged the arrest of Dogsom and Darizavyn Losol on charges of counterrevolution. Besides Choibalsan himself, the two were the last remaining members of the original \\"First Seven\\" founders of the MPP. He was sent to Moscow and tried on July 8, 1941 under Soviet authorities. He was executed on July 27 of the same year.

Students may present their science project at a science fair, so they may also call it a science fair project. Science projects may be classified into four main types. Science projects are done by students worldwide. Experimental projects Experimental projects, also known as investigatory projects, start with a question (AKA a hypothesis), use the scientific method to complete the research, and end with a report detailing the results and conclusions and an abstract. Engineering projects Engineering projects, also known as technology projects, start with a design of a machine or mechanical structure with the purpose of improving strength or performance. Researchers implement all their design ideas in a model they construct. The model will be tested to evaluate the design. Display projects This student is carrying his science project to school. Display projects involve a creative assembly of a display board and construction of a model to show a visual representation of a larger fact. Making a model of the solar system, a house, or of a simple electric circuit are considered display projects. Display boards are used to enhance the presentation. A tablet computer can be attached to the display board to make interactive display boards. Theoretical projects Theoretical projects may involve the same format as experimental or engineering projects. However, for several possible reasons, such as lack of feasibility due to costs, the actual experiment is not performed.

The trail traverses Sugarland Mountain, a massive ridge running perpendicular to the main crest of the Smokies and effectively dividing the park's north-central section from its northwestern section. Sugarland Mountain is flanked by the deep upper valleys of two of the park's major watersheds— the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River (to the east) and Little River (to the west). The trail passes through several forest types, including deciduous forest at lower elevations, heaths (\\"hells\\") along the mountain's backbone formations, and a stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest in the upper elevations. Occasional breaks in the foliage allow for views of Mount Le Conte and Sevier County to the east and Blanket Mountain and the ridges above Elkmont to the west. The trailhead is located at Fighting Creek Gap along Little River Road, between Gatlinburg and Elkmont. The trail's terminus is located just off Clingmans Dome Road, where the trail intersects the Appalachian Trail. Vital information * The Sugarland Mountain Trailhead at Fighting Creek Gap shares a parking lot with the popular Laurel Falls Trail (on the other side of the road). This parking lot fills up quickly on weekends, especially during Spring and Summer. * Backcountry campsite #21, formerly located on the Sugarland Mountain Trail near the Junction with Huskey Gap Trail, has been relocated to the Huskey Gap Trail near the junction with Little River Trail. * While there is a small parking lot (shared with the Fork Ridge Trail) near the trail terminus along Clingmans Dome Road, this road is closed December 1 through April 1. If the road is closed, the nearest parking lot is at Newfound Gap, east of the trail terminus. * The Mount Collins Shelter is approximately from the trailhead. * During cooler months, ice often forms on rock outcroppings along the trail between Huskey Gap and the Rough Creek junction. As the afternoon sun heats the western slopes of the mountain, this ice can break off and crash to the ground without warning. Ice and snow can also make the steeper ledges between the Rough Creek junction and the trail terminus slippery. * The Sugarland Mountain Trail— when conjoined with the Cove Mountain Trail, Laurel Falls Trail, Fork Ridge Trail, and Deep Creek Trail— forms a continuous path connecting the Sugarland Visitor Center (near Gatlinburg) with the Deep Creek Campground (near Bryson City).

The snow on the left will eventually end up in Little River, 2000 feet below. The snow on the right will end up in the Little Pigeon River. Sugarland Mountain is a ridge that consists of a series knobs and peaks, each increasing in elevation as the mountain approaches its junction with the main Smokies crest. The northernmost knobs, which overlook Fighting Creek Gap and Mids Gap, have elevations of around . Beyond Huskey Gap, the mountain rises sharply to its prominent northern peak as the crest narrows, and maintains an elevation of to for several miles. At the headwaters of Rough Creek, the mountain rises above for the first time, eventually reaching at its summit. The Chimney Tops, which consist of two barren slate capstones, crown a narrow ridge that branches off the southeastern slope of Sugarland Mountain, opposite the Rough Creek headwaters. Sugarland Mountain's various knobs and peaks are typically connected by narrow \\"backbone\\" ridges, some of which are just a few feet wide. The relatively broad Huskey Gap— between the mountain's northern peak and its lower northern knobs— is the exception. Several mountain streams have their sources high on slopes of Sugarland Mountain. Streams on the western side of the mountain include Mids Branch, Phoebe Branch, Big Medicine Branch, and Rough Creek. These all empty into Little River, which proceeds northward to Elkmont, veers west through the Little River Gorge, and turns north again to traverse Blount County before emptying into the Fort Loudoun Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River. Streams on the western side of the mountain include Sugarland Branch, Hickory King Branch, and Road Prong. These empty into the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River, which proceeds northward through Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge and Sevierville, where it merges with the Little Pigeon River proper before emptying into the French Broad River. Historical information The Sugarland Mountain Trail at Huskey Gap, with the northern peak visible through the treeline In Cherokee lore, the eastern slopes of Sugarland Mountain— along with the northern slopes of Mount Le Conte— were part of a ridgeline known as Walasi'yi, or \\"Frog Place.\\"James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 299, 545. An ancient Native American trail— possibly predating the Cherokee— crossed the crest at Indian Gap and descended along Road Prong to the West Fork of the Little Pigeon Valley. The trail then followed the valley northward, where it intersected the Great Indian Warpath near modern Sevierville. This trail was expanded several times by Euro-American settlers throughout the 19th century. While the main road gradually shifted to the lower Newfound Gap, the Road Prong Trail still follows this ancient road.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 322-323. The Rough Creek Valley - Horace Kephart's \\"Godforsaken\\" In the late 19th century, the residents of Little River (now Elkmont) and the Sugarlands built a log schoolhouse at Huskey Gap. To allow easier access to the school, they constructed a crude road along what is now the Huskey Gap Trail.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 31. Although the schoolhouse had burned down by 1916,Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County, 31. the trail received continued use by Sugarlanders working in logging camps in the Elkmont vicinity in the 1920s.Vic Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont (Knoxville, Tenn.: Olden Press, 1993), 26. By the time the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission started buying up tracts of land in the late 1920s for the formation of the national park, the Little River Lumber Company owned the entire western side of Sugarland Mountain and the Champion Fibre Company owned the mountain's southeastern section.Carlos Campbell, Birth of a National Park In the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), 69. Members of the Parton family and Huskey family owned small farms around Huskey Gap and the headwaters of Sugarland Branch, and members of the Quilliams family lived in the vicinity of Backcountry Campsite 21.Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County, map on the last page. Author Horace Kephart, writing in the early 20th century, described Sugarland Mountain as a \\"razorback ridge\\" that formed a \\"rampart tedious to scale from either side.\\"Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 214. Kephart referred to the upper Rough Creek Valley on the mountain's southwestern slope as \\"Godforsaken\\" — a remote land that seemed \\"unearthly in its dreariness and desolation.\\"Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders, 214. In \\"A Raid Into the Sugarlands,\\" Kephart gave a quasi-factual account of a North Carolina deputy's excursion into the Sugarlands to apprehend a fugitive. The deputy and his hodgepodge posse chased the fugitive across Sugarland Mountain to \\"Barradale's upper logging camp\\" on Rough Creek, although they failed to locate him. They returned to North Carolina empty-handed the following day.Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders, 230-233. George McCoy, writing in an early park guide in 1935, reported that the Sugarland Mountain Trail was \\"extremely rugged,\\" but offered excellent views of Mount Le Conte.George McCoy, Guide to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Asheville: The Inland Press, 1935), 66. In 1937, Laura Thornborough— who wrote extensively of hiking trails in the Smokies— echoed McCoy's description, calling the Sugarland Mountain Trail \\"rugged and rough,\\" but well worth an all-day trip.Laura Thornborough, Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1942), 107. Trail synopsis =Fighting Creek Gap to Huskey Gap — 3.1 miles= Mount Le Conte, viewed from a break in the foliage a mile or so from the trailhead The first half-mile or so of the Sugarland Mountain Trail is uphill as the trail rises out of Fighting Creek Gap and winds its way around the eastern side of the mountain's northernmost knob. After descending to Mids Gap (an unmarked manway follows Mids Branch to the Elkmont Nature Trail, a mile or so to the west), the trail swings to the western slope of the mountain, where it winds its way up and around a second knob and gradually descends to Huskey Gap. At Huskey Gap, the Sugarland Mountain Trail, which runs north-to-south, intersects the Huskey Gap Trail, which runs roughly east-to-west. The eastern half of the Huskey Gap Trail descends to Newfound Gap Road (U.S. Route 441), and continues as a \\"Quiet Walkway\\" to the ruins of the Sugarlands community along the banks of the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. The western half of the Huskey Gap Trail descends to the Little River Trail and Little River, just upstream from Elkmont. =Huskey Gap to Rough Creek Trail junction — 4.2 miles= View of Sevier County from a backbone between the north peak and the Rough Creek Trail The Huskey Gap-to-Rough Creek section of the Sugarland Mountain Trail is characterized by heaths and boulder fields as it winds its way around the western slope of Sugarland Mountain's northern peak. This peak comes into clear view as the trail enters its first substantial stand of heath immediately south of Huskey Gap. As the trail begins to ascend the northern peak, it reenters a thick deciduous forest. The headwaters of various streams have cut a series of hollows into the western flank of this peak, leading down into the Little River Valley. These upper hollows are littered with boulders, which over the years have broken off from higher elevations and have been carried down into the streambeds by erosional forces. Backcountry Campsite 21 was formerly located amidst the first of these boulder fields in the headwaters of Big Medicine Branch prior to being relocated to the Huskey Gap Trail near the junction with Little River Trail. Sandstone outcroppings are not uncommon along the steep western slope of the north peak. Approximately from the campsite, a pile of large rocks allows for an unobstructed view out over the Little River Valley westward to Miry Ridge and Blanket Mountain. Beyond the north peak, the trail traverses its first substantial backbone. Gatlinburg and Newfound Gap Road are visible through the treeline to the east. =Rough Creek Trail junction to Appalachian Trail — 4.8 miles= Mount Mingus, visible appx. 10 miles from the trailhead The Rough Creek-to- Appalachian Trail segment of the Sugarland Mountain Trail is its most rugged and most strenuous. Most of the remainder of the trail consists of sharp ascents over steep ledges alternating with smooth strolls over narrow backbones. Approximately one mile of the lower section of trail was burned during the catastrophic wildfirefire that occurred in the area in November 2016. This portion of the trail is now overgrown with tall weeds and brambles in summertime. At just over , a break in the foliage allows for an unobstructed view of the Rough Creek Valley below and Sweet Ridge and Miry Ridge in the distance to the northwest and west. Mount Le Conte dominates the view through the treeline to the east. The Sugarland Mountain Trail terminus Around from the trailhead, the Sugarland Mountain Trail passes just below the mountain's summit, which rises at the mountain's junction with Sweet Ridge. Beyond the summit, Mount Collins becomes visible through the treeline to the south, and Mount Mingus dominates the view to the east. After winding its way across Sugarland Mountain's upper elevations, the trail ascends sharply to the Mount Collins Shelter and the trail terminus along the Appalachian Trail. West of the Sugarland Mountain Trail terminus, the Appalachian Trail continues to ascend sharply, crossing the summit of Mount Collins and continuing onward to Clingmans Dome. A small footpath east of the trail terminus leads to Clingmans Dome Road and the Fork Ridge Trail terminus on the other side of the road. Newfound Gap is approximately east of the trail terminus. The Mount Collins Shelter is situated just off the Sugarland Mountain Trail approximately north of the trail's terminus at the Appalachian Trail. A spring— part of the headwaters of Moccasin Branch— provides the shelter's water source. The shelter— built of stone and enclosed by fencing at one end— is typical of Appalachian Trail shelters in the area.

He remained in the league for the season before being promoted to the Carolina League for the season. He spent half a season there before again being promoted on June 27 to the Eastern League. He umpired in the EL through the season, when he was brought up to the International League. Pallone spent the season in both the International and Eastern Leagues before being called up for good to the IL in . He stayed in the league until , when he was one of eight umpires hired during that year's strike by major league umpires. Pallone remained in the NL for ten years, and umpired in the 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the 1987 National League Championship Series. He was the home plate umpire when Pete Rose tied Ty Cobb for the most hits (4191); Nolan Ryan's 4,000th strikeout on July 11, , and on September 25, , he was the second base umpire when Mike Scott of the Houston Astros pitched a 2–0 no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants to clinch the NL West Division championship. On April 30, , Pallone was involved in a highly controversial confrontation with Rose when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. Pallone was umpiring at first base when he called New York Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson safe on a delayed call in the ninth inning, with the delay giving Howard Johnson the time to score the eventual game-winning run. Rose immediately rushed to Pallone to argue both the call and how slowly it was made. With both tempers boiling over, Pallone was mocking Rose's gestures by pointing his finger at Rose, which led Rose to accuse Pallone of poking him in the face. Rose then shoved Pallone, causing Rose's immediate ejection. Pallone denied touching Rose and Major League Baseball never determined that he did in fact touch Rose, nor did they determine that he did not. The incident led to fans throwing garbage on the field, temporarily stopping the game and causing Pallone to be taken out of the game to ease tensions. The incident also resulted in Rose being suspended for 30 days with a $10,000 fine as well. In September of that year, Pallone was forced to resign. He was \\"outed\\" in a New York Post article later in the year. Pallone later wrote his autobiography, Behind the Mask: My Double Life in Baseball, which became a New York Times best-seller, and has been republished as an e-book.

Built in 1828, it has been in continuous use since then. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973, as a possible work of Robert Mills, an important American architect of the first half of the 19th century. and It also has the distinction of being the site of the last witch trials to take place in the United States. Description and history The Lancaster County Courthouse is located in the heart of downtown Lancaster, at the southwest corner of Meeting Street (South Carolina Highway 9) and Main Street (United States Route 521). It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of locally-made bricks laid in English bond, with Flemish bond around the windows. Its main facade is five bays wide, with the main entrance on the second floor, accessed via stairs on either side of a projecting classical temple front supported by Tuscan columns. Windows are rectangular, set in round-arch openings. The interior of the ground floor has barrel-vaulted ceilings, providing support for the upper floor. The judge's bench in the main courtroom is a particularly fine example of Federal period wood carving. The courthouse was built in 1828 by Willis Alsobrook, and its design has been attributed, without conclusive evidence, to the architect Robert Mills, who is known to have designed the old 1823 county jail, also a National Historic Landmark. The building has been in continuous use as a courthouse since its construction. In 2008, the courthouse was heavily damaged, but not destroyed, by fire caused by arson; it will be rebuilt. On September 19, 2008, a local 17-year-old, Martavious Carter, was accused for setting the fire while being interviewed for other crimes he had recently committed.

It heads south toward Long Island Sound, soon crossing over the Amtrak railroad tracks, then turning east at Goshen Cove after another two miles (3 km). It soon passes by the entrance to Harkness Memorial State Park then cuts northeast across the shore along Niles Hill Road, crossing Alewife Cove into the city of New London. In New London, it turns north following Ocean Avenue through the southwestern part of the city to end at an intersection with US 1 in the downtown area. History In the 1920s, the road from downtown New London to Ocean Beach Park (Ocean Avenue from Route 1) was designated as a secondary state highway known as Highway 340. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, Ocean Avenue (old Highway 340) and an extension north of U.S. Route 1 along Jefferson Avenue up to Route 85 was designated as Route 213. In 1963, the southern terminus was moved westward to its current location. In 1972, the northern terminus was moved to Colman Street (modern US 1), with Route 213 ending at a junction with I-95 (then co-signed as US 1). In 1974, Colman Street became one-way southbound and the northbound route was shifted several blocks east to Jefferson Avenue.

The documentary highlights the alienation which these working class voters feel from the Tory Party. =Rivers of Blood= This documentary looks at Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech on the 40th anniversary of its delivery. The documentary charts sacking from the Cabinet of Edward Heath after the controversial speech which predicted violence on the streets of Britain and which quoted Roman poet Virgil's prophecy: \\"I see the Tiber foaming with much blood\\".BBC - White Season - Rivers of Blood The documentary also examines the effect of the speech on Britain's immigration policy. =White Girl= This drama by Abi Morgan is about an eleven-year-old English girl who becomes interested in Islam. The drama centres on a culture clash when a working class family from Leeds move to an otherwise all-Asian neighbourhood in Bradford. 11-year-old Leah (Holly Kenny) and mum Debbie (Maxwell Martin) move after a family relationship breaks down. Leah becomes friends with an Asian girl, Yasmin. However, rows begin when Leah comes home one day wearing a hijab.BBC - White Season - White Girl =The Poles are Coming!= This documentary by Tim Samuels looks at the attitudes of working class Britain's to their recent East European arrivals. The documentary is set in Peterborough and looks at the strain on public services and the effect on the local economy of thousands of new immigrants. The documentary contrasts the positive attitude employers have to the Polish immigrants to that of working class youths who accuse the new arrivals of taking their employment. The effect on Eastern Europe itself is also examined. It is revealed that Poland is struggling to build stadiums for the Euro 2012 Championship because of the skills drain. Despite the programme's title, it is not only Poles who have migrated to the city in large numbers in recent years, and the documentary shows that foreigners from other Eastern European countries, along with Asian immigrants, have swelled the population of that formerly small city. In parts of Peterborough, including Millfield, English people are the minority. The documentary included scenes at a primary school at which only one pupil spoke English as his first language - the vast majority of the children were Eastern Europeans and Asians. =The Primary= This documentary is on Welford Primary School in Handsworth, Birmingham, which has pupils from 17 different nationalities. Head teacher Chris Smith attempts to make pupils aware of the many different nationalities and cultures.BBC - White Season - The Primary =All White in Barking= This documentary by Marc Isaacs is on the area of Barking and Dagenham, in outer East London, which has recently seen some of the highest levels of immigration in the United Kingdom, and, as a result, is the borough with the highest number of BNP councillors in the UK. The activities of an activist for the British National Party are also analysed.FT.com / Home UK / UK - White men unburdened One of the people featured was a middle-aged white man, originally from Bow but who had moved a few miles east to Barking, who was horrified that many of his English neighbours had been recently replaced by various foreigners, and that his daughter had a child by a very violent Nigerian immigrant. The father and his daughter explained how she and her child have to live in protected, secure housing, as it is the only way to escape the Nigerian and his savagery. At the end of the documentary, the Englishman moves to (the much whiter) Canvey Island, Essex. Controversy =Allegations of racism= Allegations of racism emerged after the trailer for the series was shown where a white face was covered in writing until it disappeared under a mass of ink. It read 'Britain is changing' in many different languages. In an interview the BBC 2 controller Roly Keating responded: \\"I absolutely refute that it is at all racist. It's clearly arresting. It denotes to audiences that they will find certain elements of this season challenging. Part of the point of the BBC is to stimulate public debate.\\" Interview: Roly Keating, BBC2 controller Media The Guardian =Allegations of stereotyping= The series also gained criticism for the portrayal it gave to white working class Britons. Sarah Mukherjee, an environment correspondent at the BBC, argued that the series reinforced stereotypes that the white working class were violent, racist and lived on benefits.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1581438/BBC- series-'labels-white-working-class-racist'.html The BBC’s commissioning editor, Richard Klein, stated that the commissioning of the series was in response to a report which showed that white working class voices rarely made it onto TV, and that when they were shown, they were portrayed as \\"chavs\\" and \\"white trash\\".

Compared to continuously-flowing springs, rhythmic springs are uncommon, with the number worldwide estimated in 1991 to be around one hundred.Mather (2013), p.135, citing Bonacci and Bojanić, 1991. Mather notes that the figure of 100 is likely to be an underestimate.  Theory  Although the cause of the periodicity in flow is not known for certain, the most accepted theory (first postulated in the early 18th century) is that as groundwater flows continuously into a cavern, it fills a narrow tube that leads upwards from near the base of the cavern, then downwards to the spring. As the water level reaches the high point of the tube, it creates a siphon effect, sucking water out of the chamber. Eventually air rushes into the tube and breaks the siphon, stopping the flow if there is no other source feeding the spring, or reducing the flow if there is a continuous flow from another non-siphon source.Mather (2013), pp.144–9. In 2006 the University of Utah studied the Intermittent Spring in Swift Creek canyon in Star Valley, Wyoming, United States. Kip Solomon, a hydrologist at the University concluded that \\"The spring water's gas content has now been tested [...]. The data strongly suggests the water was exposed to air underground; strong support for the siphon theory.\\" Notable rhythmic springs The \\"Intermittent Spring\\" in Wyoming, mentioned above, is the largest rhythmic spring in the world. The Gihon Spring in the City of David in Jerusalem used to be a rhythmic spring before modern-time overpumping affected the level of the underground water table. It was of great historical, archaeological, and cultural importance because it is what made possible the human settlement in ancient Jerusalem. Pliny the Younger---who is famous for his accurate description of the Vesuvius eruption of AD 79---also accurately described a rhythmic spring in the last letter of Book IV.Pliny the Younger, Letters, 4.30 This rhythmic spring is still acting to the same time scale today (Villa Pliniana spring in Como, Italy).

It is a salmon enhancement project supported by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. It was started in 1976 by high school volunteers from local Centennial School in Coquitlam and teachers Ruth Foster and Rod MacVicar. They formed the Centennial School Salmon project, which is still an active club at the school. It has received much recognition for its unique and longstanding work. Ruth Foster has won a Canadian Environment Award for her work at Mossom Creek Hatchery. When the hatchery began, there were no salmon left in Mossom Creek. Thanks to the efforts of volunteers over the decades there is now a strong run of chum salmon and an increasing run of coho salmon. The hatchery also supplies fish to other streams that drain into Burrard Inlet. By reintroducing these salmon, the hatchery strengthens the surrounding ecosystem at various trophic levels. Every year the hatchery releases approximately 100,000 chum fry into the area and approximately 7,000 coho smolts. The hatchery is operated by Burrard Inlet Marine Enhancement Society, a non-profit group, and relies on volunteers year round. They also work closely with other organizations such as the Pacific WildLife Foundation and the Port Moody Ecological Society. Eggs and milt are collected from chum and coho salmon in the fall and early winter from Mossom Creek, Noons Creek (in cooperation with the Port Moody Ecological Society), and sometimes other river systems such as the Indian River. The eggs are fertilized and placed in stacked incubators until they hatch. During the winter, eggs hatch into alevins which absorb their yolk sacks to become fry. Chum are released into the streams as large fry in the spring. Coho smolts that are a year old are also released, as the coho fry must spend an extra year in the hatchery's large rearing tubs. Mossom Creek has been an absolutely pristine creek, and it is home to several other species of wildlife such as the coastal tailed frog and the American dipper. Black-tailed deer, black bear and bobcat also make their home within the watershed forest. Recently, upstream development on steep slopes in the Village of Anmore, has impacted the stream with heavy siltation. Much volunteer time has been directed at documenting and dealing with this issue. Another recent effect of upstream development can be see in recent water quality tests. These tests indicate that the levels of phosphates and nitrates have recently reached a detectable level.

History The first priest to attend Catholics in Ulster County along the river was Rev. Arthur Langdill who was stationed in Newburgh 1817-1818. Saugerties was the first place in Ulster to warrant the erection of a church. They were mainly Irish seeking work in the iron works, paper mills, and stone quarries. In 1830 Rev. Philip O'Reilly O.P., from County Cavan, Ireland, was sent by Bishop John Dubois to establish missions and build churches along the Hudson wherever there were sufficient resident Catholics. O'Reilly visited the village of Saugerties in 1832 about one Sunday a month, holding services in private homes. The church cornerstone was laid in 1833. O'Reilly was said to be a man of large and powerful build and commanding presence. At this time he was also serving congregations in Rondoubt, Newburgh, and Poughkeepsie. The church at Saugerties was dedicated in 1843.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X.

(New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.432 The Cemetery grew from the first graves around the church in 1833 to fill much of the church property now occupied. In 1915, nine acres in Barclay Heights were purchased for a new cemetery.\\"The History of St. Mary of the Snow\\", 175th Anniversary Book In 1837 Rev. Patrick Duffy became pastor of Our Lady of Loretto in Cold Spring and took over the missions in Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, and Saugerties. The first baptisms in Saugerties took place in May 1837. The same year Duffy was appointed pastor in Newburgh, at which time Rondout and Saugerties became mission stations of St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie. When St. Mary's in Rondout became a parish, Saugerties came under its jurisdiction. In 1847 the Diocese of Albany was established with the line of division falling between Rondout and Saugerties. Saugerties then came for a time under the care of Michael Gilbride, Pastor at Hudson. Rev. Michael C. Power served as pastor at Saugerties from 1852 to 1878. Power established a mission in Quarryville. During his tenure it was not uncommon to find one hundred men led by their foreman, marching eight to ten miles to attend Mass.Burtsell, Richard Lalor. \\"The Roman Catholic Church\\", Clearwater, Alphonso Trumpbour. The History of Ulster County, New York, W. J. Van Deusen, 1907 - Ulster County (N.Y.) The local authorities came recognize the value of the priests in settling disputes among the laborers, who were for the most part without families and living in barracks around the quarries and mills. Henry Barclay, of the Ulster Iron Works, was a major contributor to the church for his workers. The basement of the church served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. The steeple was added c. 1863 with its massive bell tower, inscribed “Jones & Co., Founders, Troy, NY”. (In 1878 Father Power retired to Wappingers Falls where he assisted a classmate, Fr. Denis Sheehan. Father Power served as a missionary priest to families in Stoneco and Sylvan Lake. Power owned a tract of land on West Main Street just south of the Wappingers Rural Cemetery. This land, known as Power’s Park, was enclosed by a board fence and contained a grandstand from which spectators could watch bicycle races which were run on a 1/4 mile track. This park was also the home field of the Wappingers Monitors baseball team and was the site of some of “Big Dan” Brouthers’ most memorable hits.) Father Power was followed by Denis Paul O'Flynn as pastor. In 1892 the church was seriously damaged by fire, but repaired and renovated by Father O'Flynn. The church features a high steeple, traditional stained glass windows, including a Tiffany window depicting the Virgin Mary at the Assumption. O’Flynn also built the original rectory in 1879 which became the sisters convent/school in 1881. The church was restored again in 1989 following a March 26 Easter Sunday fire. In August 2015, St. Joseph's Church, Glasco merged with St. Mary of the Snow into one parish with two campuses. School St. Mary of the Snow was a Catholic elementary school located in Saugerties, New York, which had students enrolled in pre-school through eighth grades from all Hudson Valley, Saugerties, Kingston, Catskills and Onteora districts who sought a Catholic education. The school was founded in 1881 by the Sisters of Charity and was closed on June 20, 2013 by the Archdiocese of New York during its consolidation of education programs due to decreased enrollment and increased cost of programs.http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2013/06/21/news/doc51c3b56801bc0474246567.txt the building is currently used for parish religious education program.St. Mary of the Snow and St. Joseph Religious Education St. Joseph's, Glasco Glasco takes its name from a glass company located in the mountain area several miles inland. The glass was carried by horse down the \\"Glasco Turnpike\\" to the banks of the Hudson where it was shipped on to ports for sale. The settlement along the river where the glass was loaded became known as Glasco. Settled largely by unskilled workers, first from Ireland and then from Italy, they came to the area in great numbers in the late 19th century by ferry after landing in New York City. They tended to live in company housing on the banks of the river. At one point, the town boasted over six brick factories, a ferry service, a school, churches and several saloons. St. Joseph's Church was established around 1886 as a mission church of St. Mary of the Snow. By the end of the nineteenth and into the early twentieth century, Glasco had become predominantly settled by Italian-Americans. To better minister to the needs of the faithful, another St. Mary's resident priest, Rev. Henry Newey, was assigned to St. Joseph's Mission. Rev. Newey had been educated in Rome and was able to converse in Italian with the parishioners.\\"The History of St. Joseph's\\", St. Mary of the Snow - St. Joseph In 1917 Father James A. Talbot, pastor of St. Mary of the Snow purchased and converted a former a Dutch Reformed Church to accommodate the growing parish. In response to parishioners' requests in July 1919, Archbishop Hayes directed pastor of St. Mary's, Father Joseph G. Cushman, to send a priest fluent in Italian to reside in Glasco and Father Matthew DiOrio became the first resident pastor of the parish.

History  During the Spanish conquest of Ecuador, the city was named by Sebastián de Belalcázar as San Pedro de Alausí, giving the city the name of the saint of the day, coinciding with the founding of the city of Quito. Later the founding of the city was legalized by Benálcazar with the name \\"Alausí\\". After the creation of the Government of Quito, Alausí formed part of that province as a lesser political and administrative entity. In 1810, when Quito launched its movement for independence, Alausí recognized the new government and named Captain José Antonio Pontón as its voice and member of the Junta. When the first assembly of the free towns took place in 1811, Captain José Antonio Pontón served as Representative for the Province of Alausí, in which capacity he signed the Carta de Estado de Quito in 1812. In recognition of its patriotism, fidelity, and honor of its inhabitants, the Bishop Cuero y Caicedo resolved that the town's political and administrative status be raised to \\"Villa\\".  Transport  Alausí is served by bus to many destinations in Ecuador. Alausi's bus station is located three blocks down from the train station, on 5 de Junio along the town’s main street. Buses to and from smaller towns run regularly. There are set schedules for more popular destinations, such as Quito, Cuenca and Guayaquil. It is also the starting-off point for the Nariz del Diablo train. This engineering work is among the most audacious projects realized in the Andean mountain range. Nariz del Diablo was the tomb of many Jamaican slaves contracted to dynamite the mountain. Tourists visiting the Ingapirca ruins in Cañar can board a bus heading for Cuenca. The ruins are about an hour and a half outside of Cañar. Cityscape Alausí is known for its architecture, and most of its houses are more than 100 years old. In Alausí, one finds various monuments located in the parks and important places in the city. Without doubt the most important is the Monument to Saint Peter (Monumento a San Pedro), the patron saint of the city, built by the Ecuadorian artist Eddie Crespo. This monument is located in Loma de Lluglli, and can be seen from any point in the city due to its large size and strategic location. The most important church in the city is \\"la Matriz\\", located in front of 13 November park (parque 13 de Noviembre). The church was constructed in the 18th Century with stone extracted from the mines of Chiripungo, located about 2 kilometers outside of the city. Festivals Statue of San Pedro, Alausí Carnaval is the traditional festival of Alausí, and is celebrated with a special parade, in which the neighborhoods of the city and special invitees participate. The most important festival is the running of the bulls. Non- professional bullfighting and other festivals are also celebrated here. A testament to the Spanish influence in South America, the Festival of San Pedro is celebrated from June 22 to July 2, and has been celebrated since the colonial era. Traditional dance, music, folklore, cockfights, bullfights and other activities attract Ecuadorians and international tourists to the celebration.

Climate The climate is dry and mild and it has an average annual temperature of 18o C. The central square of Atuntaqui. Economy On August 13, 1868 Atuntaqui was partially destroyed by an earthquake that left thousands dead and homeless. After its reconstruction and its subsequent development, the textile factory, which set up an hydroelectric plant on the banks of the Ambi river and the arrival of the railway in the town of Andrade Marín, located 2.5 km east of Atuntaqui, became especially important. Since 2000, it has been noted for its textiles and crafts. Every year the Atuntaqui Expo takes place here in the Carnival holidays, a day on which the city hosts a large number of visitors (140,000 visitors in the 2009 edition), who come to make purchases. Government The Local Government is the Municipal Council located in the Atuntaqui central square. Tourism Atuntaqui has great tourism potential, offering textiles, crafts, cuisine and culture, a varied and interesting mix to be enjoyed all year round.

It was published in 1958 by Gnome Press in an edition of 5,000 copies, of which 1,084 were never bound. The novel was published in paperback by Pyramid Books in 1960 under the title Space Prison. The novel is an expansion of Godwin's story \\"Too Soon to Die\\" which first appeared in the magazine Venture. Godwin wrote a sequel, entitled The Space Barbarians and published in 1964. Plot summary A ship heading from Earth to Athena, a planet 500 light years away, is suddenly attacked by the Gerns, an alien empire in its expansion phase. People aboard are divided by the invaders into Acceptables and Rejects. The Acceptables would become slave labor for the Gerns on Athena, and the Rejects are forced ashore on the nearest 'Earth-like' planet, called Ragnarok. The Gerns say they will return for the Rejects, but the Rejects quickly realise that that isn't going to happen. Ragnarok has a gravity 1.5 times that of Earth, and is populated by deadly, aggressive creatures and it contains little in the way of usable metal ores. This, combined with a terrible deadly fever that kills in hours, more than decimates the population. The novels follows the stranded humans through several generations as they try to survive there, and their unswerving goal to repay the Gerns for their cruelty. Reception Floyd C. Gale wrote that he \\"read this yarn with the same glow of pride in the indestructibility of the human race that I once received from van Vogt's early The Alien\\".

He is also a teacher in De La Salle College Waterford. Moran made his first appearance for the team during the 2006 championship and became a regular member of the starting fifteen over the following few seasons. Since then he has won two Munster winners' medals, one National League winners' medal as a non-playing substitute and one All-Star award. Moran has ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Moran is a two-time Munster medalist with De La Salle. In addition to this he has also won three county club championship winners' medals. Playing career =Club= Moran plays his club hurling with the De La Salle club and has enjoyed much success. He was still a minor when he made his senior debut as a seventeen-year-old in 2004, however, he quickly became a key member of the De La Salle team. In 2005 Moran lined out in his first championship decider as De La Salle faced Ballygunner. A narrow 2–10 to 1–12 defeat was Moran's lot on that occasion. After a number of years of early exits in the county championship, De La Salle reached the championship final again in 2008. Abbeyside were the opponents on that occasion and a close game developed. At the final whistle De La Salle were the champions by 0–11 to 0–9 and Moran collected his first county championship medal. De La Salle subsequently represented Waterford in the provincial series and even reached the final. A narrow 1–9 to 0–10 defeat of Adare gave Moran a first Munster medal. Moran's side later reached the All-Ireland decider where Portumna provided the opposition. De La Salle were well beaten on that occasion by 2–24 to 1–8. After surrendering their county and provincial titles in 2009, De La Salle bounced back the following year to reach the county final once again. A 3–13 to 1–11 defeat of Ballygunner gave Moran a second championship medal. He later added a second Munster medal to his collection following a one-point defeat of Thurles Sarsfield's. Two years later Moran won a third county championship medal as De La Salle trounced Dungarvan by 1–21 to 0–12 in the county final. =Inter-varsities= Moran also enjoyed much success with the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) in the universities and colleges series of games. In 2006 he was full-back on the WIT team that took on University College Dublin (UCD) in the final. A 4–13 to 0–8 trouncing of UCD gave Moran a Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Two years later WIT were back in the final, this time with Moran as captain. A narrow 0–16 to 1–12 defeat of the Limerick Institute of Technology (LIT) gave Moran a second Fitzgibbon Cup medal. =Inter- county= Moran made his senior debut for Waterford in a National League game against Wexford in 2006. Later that year he made his championship debut during the All-Ireland qualifiers. In 2007 Moran was still a peripheral figure on the Waterford team. He was a non-playing substitute as Waterford won the National Hurling League title following a 0–20 to 0–18 defeat of Kilkenny. Moran, however, later claimed his first Munster medal as Waterford defeated Limerick by 3–17 to 1–14 in the provincial decider. While Waterford were viewed as possibly going on and winning the All-Ireland title for the first time in almost half a century, Limerick ambushed Moran's side in the subsequent All- Ireland semi-final. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start Moran's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to trounce Waterford by 3–30 to 1–13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. Moran lined out in another Munster final in 2010 with Cork providing the opposition. A 2–15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Dan Shanahan. It was a second Munster winners' medal for Moran. In spite of a disappointing season for Waterford in 2012, Moran was presented with his first All-Star award. On 3 May 2015, Moran was captain as Waterford won their first league title since 2007 after a 1–24 to 0–17 win against Cork in the final. On 3 September 2017, Moran was captain and scored an early goal as Waterford lost the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Final to Galway.

It is the seat of the La Maná Canton.La Maná, is one of seven canton of the Cotopaxi Province in Ecuador. La Maná is not only a canton but also is the name the main town. It has a total area of 66,258 acres. It is the sixth canton of the province of Cotopaxi. The origin of La Mana has its mysteries and charms. La Mana, is derived from LANG MANA ATTI which means “mine of great king”. It is named that because of its abundance of gold and other minerals in the subsoil. The “Colorado” word (safiqui) MANA means “beautiful, big” which is attributed to the fertility of the land. La Mana was inhabited by the Tsachilas or “Los Colorados”. In the sector, many vestiges of their presence have been discovered, such as pieces of clay, zoomorphic statuettes with ornaments, and clay pots, where presumably, they melted metals like the gold that abounded in the mountains. The legislative Committee of Civil and Penal Law sent a bill for the creation of the canton La Maná, in the Cotopaxi Province. On May 19, 1986, under the government of León Febres Cordero, La Maná became a canton. In the canton, there is a monument to commemorate Carlos Lozada Quintana, who owned the La Merced Hacienda. He donated the lands for plazas, parks, streets, schools, and indispensable services for the community´s welfare. La Mana, unlike other towns, is a settlement town by people who came from different parts of the country. They all brought their customs and traditions with them. Its immense forests, its gigantic plantations of banana, orito, yucca, cocoa, tobacco and coffee, as well as its strategic geographic location and its auriferous wealth, confer special characteristics that favor its development and has a leading role in Ecuadorian economy.  Location  La Maná Canton is located in the foothills of the western mountain range of Los Andes. It is located on a plain of a mountain range formed by alluvial deposits covered with ashes and volcanic sands of unknown origin. The main town sits on an ancient alluvial terrace of the San Pablo River. It has several climatic levels that vary from subtropical to tropical.  Climate  The annual average temperature is 23 °C. The months with the highest temperature are March and April with 28 to 30º and the month with the lowest temperature is July with 18 °C. La Maná has two seasons: dry and wet season. During the dry season, the temperature is cooler with a minimum of 18 °C and it does not rain at all. For the wet season, the temperature reaches its peak at 30 °C and is very humid and rainy. The rain can cause floods in certain parts of the canton. Usually the wet season starts in December and ends in May. The dry season starts in June and ends in November.  Tourist places  = Las 7 Cascadas = La Maná has a tourist attraction called “Las 7 Cascadas” or “Cascadas del Zapanal”. This attraction gets a lot of tourists. This natural attraction belongs to Canton Pangua; however, because is so close to La Maná it is considered a part of this canton. = The Cañaveral = These mines are located 12 km away from the center of La Mana. It is also known for its organic gold. = Mirador Pucayacu = It is located five minutes from the urban center of Pucayacu. There is a view of the entire Pucayacu town from the top. = Cascada Guadual = It is located 15 km away from Pucayacu. It is necessary to follow a path to arrive there. The waterfall is approximately 25 meters high. In addition, 30 meters from the waterfall is another one that has a natural pool suitable for swimming. To get to the location, it is necessary to have a tourist guide to ensure the safety of the tourist. = Cascada de Brasil = It is located about 8 km from the center of Pucayacu and a two-hour walk from the Pucayacu – Sigchos road. The waterfall has an approximate height of 15 meters with an emerald colored lagoon of 5 meters in diameter. In the surrounding areas are flora species such as: orchids, Camacho (Xanthosoma undipes), Pambil (Wettinia Mayencis), Platanillo (Heliconia bihai L), ferns (Pteridium quilinum), and others. Among the species of fauna are butterflies, woodpeckers (Colaptes melanochloros) and many others. = Traditional Fair of Pucayacu Parish = The fair is held every Thursday and has been held for more than 50 years. The products for sale are green plantain, pork, beef, and vegetables from the sierra, Manaba cheeses, and Chinese potato. One negative aspect of this fair is the littering that occurs from the customers. You can also find lodging and food services near here. = Guasaganda = Guasaganda is a town of the canton La Maná, and it is located in the lower part of the province of Cotopaxi, about 60 kilometers from Quevedo. Its history is born with the first settlers that came from Sucre and Carmela, but the first inhabitants were the Indigenas who arrived from Saquisilí, Sigchos, Zumbahua, Chugchilán and Moreta. In addition, it is said that the Pucayaquenses colonized it. These uncultivated lands crossed the zone of the mountain range to Selecto. They were rough grounds that were difficult to cross because of the Guasaganda, Barropungo and Quindigua rivers. According to investigations the name ¨Guasa¨ comes from the Castilian word meaning “rude” and “Ganda” means “augmentative,” which can be interpreted to Big Land. Guasaganda was populated by wild animals, contributing to the difficulty of the journey, hence the name ¨Guasaganda¨. = Hacienda Malqui = This attraction is located in the north of the Pucayacu. It is about an hour and a half from La Maná. It was not known that the pile of stone that were in the property were an archaeological site, which were from the Atahualpa tomb. ¨Malqui¨ means “body or mummy of the Incas´s ancestors”. According to the distribution of the plants and the position of the infrastructure, it is estimated to be a populated center and more than 100 years old. On this cattle ranch, approximately 90 acres, people produce panela and artisan liquor. = Machay Archaeological Site = To enter these ruins, one must follow a cement road from the river Machay. The Ushno Pyramid shaped steps are supposed to be the King’s thrown. A water channel forms where the Incas bathed. “Machay¨ means “sanctuary”. The site that houses the ruins of Machay belongs to the Malqui region. With more than 100 years of history, researchers have found archaeological pieces, dating from the time of the Incas. They also found a stone construction made in the river, which is believed to have been the center of worship. It is currently part of the Malqui Machay cultural project.

Plotutils is a GNU package and is distributed under a free software licence, the GPL. History Several utilities were inspired by Unix plotting utilities. A graph utility and various plot filters were present in the first releases of Unix from Bell Laboratories. By the time of Version 7 Unix, \`graph', \`plot', \`spline', and several device-dependent versions of \`libplot' were a standard Unix features. The first display device supported by the package was a Tektronix 611 storage scope. By the early 1980s, numerous other devices were supported. In 1989, the first GNU versions of \`graph', \`plot', \`tek2plot', \`spline' and their respective documentation were written. Richard Stallman further directed development of the programs and documentation. The distribution, as it stood in 1991, was distributed under the name \`GNU graphics'. In 1995 the package was significantly expanded by writing a device- independent, standalone version of \`libplot', and by rewriting \`graph' from scratch, turning it into a real-time filter.

Jacob Ellehammer built the aircraft based on his monoplane design of the previous year. Like that aircraft, it featured a large, triangular wing, with a motor (of Ellehammer's own design and construction) mounted beneath it. The pilot sat on a seat that was suspended like a pendulum, allowing him to shift his weight to control the aircraft, similar in concept (if not execution) to the control of a modern hang-glider. Unlike his monoplane, however, the semi-biplane's main wing formed a constant, unbroken span. Additionally, it was fitted with an upper wing of the same triangular shape, which connected to the main wing at its three corners and to an arch above the aircraft's centreline. In this aircraft, Ellehammer made a short hop on on 16 August, and a sustained flight on 12 September, covering 42 metres at an altitude of around 50 cm (140 ft at around 2 ft). This was not a free flight, however, as the aircraft was tethered to a pole at the center of the runway. A replica of the aircraft was constructed in 1966 by Arvid Ligaard Sørensen, powered by a Citroën 2CV engine and donated to the Danmarks Flymuseum. Tests with the replica showed difficulties in transmitting engine power to the propeller and while this aircraft could taxi, it proved impossible to coax from the ground.

He played in eight games for the 1911 Brooklyn Dodgers. Later, he served as the chief of the enforcement division of the Ohio State Liquor Department from 1935-39. Biography Humphrey was born in Ashtabula, Ohio, the son of Russell and May (nee Castle) Humphrey. He joined the Charlotte Hornets minor league baseball team for the 1909 season. Initially a pitcher, by 1911 he had converted to an outfielder and was signed by the Youngstown Steelmen of the Ohio-Pennsylvania League. In August 1911, the Brooklyn Dodgers (then called the Superbas) purchased his rights. Humphrey made his major league debut in the second game of a doubleheader against Boston on 1 September, in which he hit a single off the first pitch he received. However, his career in Brooklyn would be short-lived, playing only eight games. Before the end of the month, he was released to Toronto's minor league team. He announced the following February that he intended to give up baseball and would become a farmer, partly because he had recently gotten married. Farming apparently did not pan out, as by 1932 he was an inspector for Ohio's Prohibition agency. In 1935, he was promoted to head of the Ohio Liquor Department's enforcement division following the dismissal and death of his predecessor, Edmond G. Mathews. Beginning in 1937, a series of scandals shook the department. One inspector was found by an Ohio Senate investigation to have illegally sold liquor on commission while working for the department. This was followed by a broader investigation into graft within the department, during which the investigating committee threatened to \\"level [Humphrey's] department to the ground and reduce it to ruins.\\" This further expanded into inquiries of other state departments, until Governor Martin L. Davey requested it be halted. Humphrey was subsequently dismissed from his position in early 1939, and the staffing of the liquor enforcement division was cut in half.

The Village Voice calls it \\"a fearless reimagining of the geography and meaning of the African diaspora.\\" The Boston Globe said, \\"Crossing the River bears eloquently chastened testimony to the shattering of black lives.\\" Plot introduction Crossing the River is a story about three black people during different time periods and in different continents as they struggle with the separation from their native Africa. The novel follows Nash, who travels from America to Africa to educate natives about Christ; Martha, an old woman who attempts to travel from Virginia to California to escape the injustices of being a slave; and Travis, a member of the U.S. military who goes to England during World War II. =Explanation of the novel's title= The title Crossing the River refers to a metaphor for both death and deliverance. Figuratively, the river symbolizes the great obstacles Africans had to overcome during life in being forcefully displaced. Those that survived the passage to their new destination spent the rest of their lives trying to overcome the obstacles. Most, however, as Phillips suggests, can only successfully cross the river and be delivered in death. The ancestor narrator also seems to suggest this when he calls his children home to him on the far side of the river after they have passed on. Geographically, the river refers to the Atlantic Ocean, the main body of water that Africans had to cross when traveling to America. Plot summary The novel’s opening is mostly the perspective of Nash, Martha, and Travis’ “father” mixed with the thoughts of the English slave trader James Hamilton, which are expressed in italics. The narrator explains that he had to sell his three children to slavery because his crops failed and he had no money. Nash’s story as an adult is first revealed through the perspective of his white master Edward Williams, who freed Nash so that he could go to Africa with the American Colonization Society to teach black natives. Edward, however, receives a letter saying that Nash had disappeared from the African village where he had been teaching. Edward immediately boards a ship to take him to Africa, and after many days of searching, a former slave of Edward’s informs him that Nash had died from fever. Edward is horribly upset, and his grief is further drawn out when he realizes that his beloved Nash was not the holy Christian he thought him to be. He finds plenty that points out Nash’s negative behavior, such as his large collection of native wives. The chapter ends with Edward gaping at the hovel that was once Nash’s residence while natives stare on, trying to understand the apparent momentary insanity of the shocked and aggrieved stranger. The story then switches to Martha Randolph, an old woman who, after losing her husband and daughter at a slave auction, decides to run away from her owners in Kansas and seek freedom in California. She only makes it to Colorado, however, where the group she is traveling with leaves her because she is slowing down the party. A white woman offers Martha a place to room for the night out of the bitter cold, but it is not enough. When the woman returns to Martha the next day, Martha is dead. The white woman decides that she is going to have to “choose a name for her if she was going to receive a Christian burial” (p. 94), which is ironic since Martha hated receiving a new name each time she was passed to a different owner and because Martha didn't believe in God. The final section is told through the eyes of Joyce, a white Englishwoman who falls in love with Travis, who is the “brother” of Nash and Martha. Since Travis’ story occurs during World War II (about a century after his supposed brother Nash's), it can be assumed that Travis is a sort of reincarnation of Nash and Martha’s brother from more than a century before. In that case, it can be implied that the ancestor narrator is not the children’s true father; rather he is some sort of all-knowing ancestor who has “listened” to his “children” for the last “two hundred and fifty years” (p. 1). Joyce meets Travis at her husband’s store. Joyce’s husband habitually beats her, and when her husband is taken to prison for selling items on the black market, Joyce and Travis have an affair. Joyce has Travis’s baby but has to give it up after Travis dies in the war because it would be unacceptable for her to raise a black baby on her own. The chapter ends with a visit from Greer when he is 20 years old, who meets his mother for the first time after being raised in an orphanage. The book ends with the ancestor narrator once more, who provides an optimistic view even after all his children have died, saying that though he “sold his beloved children … they arrived on the far bank of the river, loved” (p. 237). Characters in Crossing the River Major characters *The Ancestor: In the opening of the novel, the narrator is the voice of an old man who was forced to sell his three children into slavery because his crops failed. As the story develops, it becomes clear that the narrator is not a person. Rather the narrator is Africa or a sort of African voice or ancestor, grieving the children it has lost in the diaspora. *Edward Williams: A rich plantation owner who believes slavery is wrong yet participates in many of its aspects. He is a Christian man whose life's work consisted of instilling Christianity among his slaves. His favorite slaves were educated and went to college at Edward's expense. Those he saw as worthy enough were sent to Liberia under the American Colonization Society. *Nash Williams: Edward Williams' favorite slave who goes to Liberia as a Christian missionary and ultimately dies. In Liberia, Nash attempts to establish a Christian settlement but fails when his master ceases to communicate with him or support him. With no support from Edward, Nash loses his way and adopts many of the African customs he had previously regarded as primitive and unchristian. Nash dies of African fever weeks after his last communication with Edward. He dies without completing his missionary work and without returning to America to see his former master. *Martha Randolph: A runaway slave whose life goal is to reach California and rejoin her long-lost daughter. She never makes it to California but gets as far as Colorado where she dies from exposure. In her moment of death, Martha is delivered and dreams of reaching California and finding her daughter, Eliza Mae. *James Hamilton: A slave trader and master of the ship the Duke of York whose actions contradict his religious beliefs. He is a Christian man and believes slavery is wrong but is not dissuaded from enterprising in human bondage. He keeps a log of events and writes the hardships of his journey in his journal, which is how the reader gains access to his interiority. *Joyce: A white Englishwoman who represents progress in eliminating discrimination against blacks. She falls in love with Travis, an African American soldier and has an affair with him while her husband, Len, is in jail. Race is not an issue with Joyce, which is made clear by the fact that she never mentions his color. *Travis: A black officer in the U.S. Army serving overseas. He falls in love with Joyce and gives her the respect and consideration she has never received. He is the only character that embodies Christian values without hypocrisy or pretense. He is relocated to Italy where he dies and leaves Joyce widowed and his son fatherless. Other characters *Madison Williams *Amelia Williams *Charles *Chester *Lucy *Eliza Mae *Len *Joyce's mother Major themes Dislocation and restoration The feeling of loss and pain in the novel stems from one main thing: dislocation. Dislocation is the one thing that creates all the painful stories. One wonders what would have happened to these characters if slave traders hadn't torn them from their homeland. Nash never would have become Edward’s pet in America and never would have journeyed back to Africa to unsuccessfully fend off disease and later die. Martha never would have lost her husband and daughter. And Travis never would have died in Italy. All of these characters died in lands that were strange to them, suggesting that the characters were ill at ease in their new environments ever since they were taken from Africa. The narrator at the beginning and end of the text, however, is still optimistic, reasoning that his children will still reach the other side of the river – their true home – if they are determined and willing to survive. Nash, Martha, and Travis all struggled and defied what was expected of them; they didn't meekly accept their situations. Nash became so delusional in Africa as a missionary that he was almost like a white slave driver himself, forcing the natives to work for him and scoffing at their ideas of religion and cultural practices. Martha, on the other hand, looked for freedom on the West Coast, and Travis fell in love with a white woman. All of these characters defied the expectation that blacks would live low, submissive lives and fulfill the desires of the white man. In this way, they were able to find the other side of the river and become rooted as the “seeds of new trees” (p. 2). Contradiction of emancipation and restriction The irony in Crossing the River is that though Nash, Martha, and Travis are all \\"free,\\" they still are restricted in many ways. They each deal with their newly found freedom in different ways: Nash agrees to go to Africa as one in few educated and freed black men. Later, however, he becomes limited and restricted in his own view of the world – he sees things as a slave owner might toward the end of the novel. Freedom for Martha comes at the cost of her life as she escapes the Hoffmans in Kansas. Travis, whose story occurs after the Emancipation Proclamation, is technically free but is still bound by a white culture that refuses to accept his relationship with a white woman. Instead of freedom enhancing their world view, freedom impedes them and is one more obstacle that they must overcome before they can reach the far side of the river. Christianity and its relation to morality and hypocrisy Christians in Crossing the River are presented somewhat negatively. Many of Phillips' characters lack faith, and the majority of those that do believe act hypocritically. For example, one of the main characters, Martha, gave up believing in God because she couldn't “sympathize with the sufferings of the son of God when set against her own private misery” (p. 79). Martha, having lost her husband and daughter and everything worthwhile in her life, completely lost faith in everything, including religion. Martha’s owners the Hoffmans, on the other hand, were devout Christians and tried to get Martha to go to a “revival by the river,” where a minister tried to “cast light on Martha’s dark soul” (p. 79). The Hoffmans try to sell Martha when the family decides they want to move to California. They don't even think twice about sending her back to Missouri, where racism and evil slave traders flourish. Their decision demonstrates a lack of strong morals despite their religion. Joyce, Travis’ love interest, also does not believe in God. She expected God to listen to her after getting an abortion, and when he didn't, she “left Christ” (p. 194). Joyce seemed to want some sort of reconciliation with her cold, distanced mother and hoped that religion could fill the gap between them. But when Joyce left church, her mother “left (her)” (p. 194). The Hoffmans and Joyce’s mother (as well as Hamilton and Nash) all had the pretense of being good Christians. In reality, however, these characters' morals were anything but good. They all tried to force their beliefs on people that they deemed were below them. Phillips seems to say that it's wrong to transplant people from their native country and then force a belief system on them that the so-called Christians don't even follow themselves. The Hoffmans, Joyce’s mother, Hamilton, and Nash are all hypocrites. Martha and Joyce struggle to find their place in this forced system of beliefs, just like the Africans struggle to find their way in America or any other place they were forced to go once they’d been uprooted from their native land. Travis alone seems to be the one person who maintains Christian beliefs without becoming a hypocrite. When Joyce’s mother dies, he asks if he can say a prayer, and Joyce lets him. He never pushes Joyce to accept his religion. Travis is obviously flawed – as demonstrated by his affair with Joyce – but at least he never pretends to be something he's not. Literary significance and reception Crossing the River has been translated into various languages and is internationally acclaimed for its portrayal of the realities of the African diaspora. It has sold hundreds of thousands of copies since its initial publication in 1993 and has become required reading in universities across the country. Black scholars and critics alike have raved at Caryl Phillips' deep insight into the struggles of Africans in one of the largest dislocations of people in history. :\\"This ambitious novel amounts to a chorale. ... Phillip's gifts are manifest and his technical prowess enlarges with each novel. ... An impressively controlled performance.\\" —Chicago Tribune :\\"Beautifully measured writing that powerfully evokes the far-reaching realities of the African diaspora. A masterwork.\\" —Kirkus Reviews :\\"With irony, understatement, and artful compression ... Phillips distills the African diaspora to an essence, bitter, and unforgettable.\\" —Entertainment Weekly :\\"Memorable, convincing characters, broad vision, and evocative narrative result in a novel both resonant and deeply moving. ... A stirring meditation on the hardship and perseverance of people torn from home.\\" —Publishers Weekly Allusions and references =Allusions to other works= Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream\\" speech The ancestor of Nash, Martha, and Travis mentions in his closing remarks the following from Martin Luther King Jr.’s \\"I have a dream\\" speech: \\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\\" The quote is useful in connecting the entire African experience through the course of generations because it relates to a recent figure in black history. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin “Crossing the river,” as mentioned before, is a reference to Uncle Tom’s Cabin when the slave Eliza crosses the river to escape from her master. However, according to some literary scholars, the crossing of the river also meant crossing from “this world to the next.” This meaning fits well with the ancestor’s desire to call his children across the river after their deaths. Similar to the “I have a dream” speech, Uncle Tom’s Cabin also strings together another aspect of the black historical perspective. For even though the text was written by a white woman, it was essential in stirring up much antislavery sentiment – even in countries as far away as England. Uncle Tom's Cabin majorly advanced the cause of African Americans across the globe. Phillips further alludes to the novel when he names Martha's daughter Eliza Mae. Eliza and Eliza Mae are both long-lost daughters. Eliza eventually meets her mother in Canada. Martha, on the other hand, only meets Eliza Mae in her dreams and finds that Eliza Mae has changed her name to Cleo. Martha reports that \\"all was not right\\" (p. 94). Martha dies moments afterward, signaling her release from the anxiety of not finding her daughter. Through death, Martha is finally able to overcome the pain of her life and \\"cross the river.\\" =Historical allusions = World War I and II A large part of Joyce’s narration focuses on these two events. She first mentions her father who died in the Great War, which in part explains Joyce’s mother’s sadness and hostility throughout the text. World War II, however, takes on a greater significance in the novel since it is actually occurring at the time that Joyce tells her narrative. The text mentions Adolf Hitler, ration books, the Axis powers, Benito Mussolini, Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, blackout curtains, Jerry planes, and even a lack of basic hygiene products such as scented soap so that the reader gets the idea of what it was to actually live in that time period. Joyce mentions the fall of France and the disappointment on the troops’ faces as they heard the news. Most importantly, however, World War II claimed the lives of Joyce’s mother and of her husband, Travis. The first died when Germans bombed her small town because it had a steel manufacturing plant, and the second died in Italy, just a few weeks before the end of the war. American Colonization Society Edward Williams sent Nash Williams to Liberia under the American Colonization Society. The society actually existed until 1964. Its full name was The Society for the Colonization of Free People of Color of America. Today, scholars argue about the extent of the society's colonization ambitions, its development of Liberia, and whether or not it was a racist society. The society closely monitored and controlled Liberia until its independence in 1847.

Barden was the Manager, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Majestic Star Casino, LLC from its formation, with responsibility for key policy making functions. Since their inception, Barden had also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Majestic Investor Holdings, LLC and Manager of Barden Colorado Blackhawk, Colorado, Barden Mississippi Tunica, Mississippi, and Barden Nevada Las Vegas, Nevada; and Chairman and President of BDI. Barden also served as Chairman or Barden Gary Foundation, Inc. and Don H. Barden Foundation, Inc. since their formations. Additionally, he was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Barden Companies, Inc. and a group of other companies he owned and/or operated. Over the past 30 years, Barden had successfully developed, owned and operated many business enterprises in various industries including real estate development, casino gaming, broadcasting, cable television and international trade. In 2003, Black Enterprise Magazine selected Barden as Company of the Year. In 2004, Barden received the Trumpet Award for Entrepreneur of the Year. For years the Barden gambling facility in Gary existed beside another gambling facility belonging to Donald Trump. Barden bought the second facility for a price reflecting historic revenue at a time when several other facilities were opening up in Illinois and Indiana. Majestic Star and Fitzgerald casinos in Indiana, Mississippi and Colorado filed for bankruptcy in November 2009. In December 2011, the facilities were turned over to creditors. The Nevada casino and Barden's ownership in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania casino were separately held and were not part of the bankruptcy. Biography When one of Barden's companies acquired the Fitzgeralds Las Vegas Casino in Las Vegas, Barden became the first African-American casino owner in Vegas. In 2007, Barden was awarded the rights to build a casino in the North Shore area of Pittsburgh, adjacent to Heinz Field, home of the Pittsburgh Steelers. The selection was made over heavy objections of local taxpayers who preferred another competing offer from Isle of Capri Casinos. That offer would have built a new multi- purpose arena adjacent to a casino complex in the area now occupied by the Civic Arena. Isle of Capri agreed to foot the entire cost of the new complex, valued at the time at 290 million dollars. Barden's selection by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Gaming Commission forced the city of Pittsburgh and the buildings principal tenant, the Pittsburgh Penguins, to come up with an alternate plan, using taxpayer money to fund the facility. In 2008, Barden was unable to secure permanent financing that would that would have permitted work to continue on the North Shore Casino project. Work at the site was stopped for weeks, until another investor could be found. Only after Chicago billionaire Neil Bluhm of JMB Realty bought controlling interest in the project, did work continue. Barden retained a minority interest in the project. On May 19, 2011, Don Barden died of lung cancer at The Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, Michigan. He was 67. Earlier that year, his wife Bella had filed for legal separation, saying in court documents that her husband was so sick with cancer that he could not make his own business and financial decisions. He and his wife Bella are interred at Woodlawn Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan) near the Michael Jackson commemorative cenotaph.

It is the most wide-ranging glacier study ever conducted using ground-based, real-time photography. Starting in 2007 the EIS team installed as many as 43 time-lapse cameras at a time at 18 glaciers in Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, Canada, the Nepalese Himalaya (where cameras were installed at Mount Everest in 2010), and the Rocky Mountains of the U.S. The cameras shoot year-round, every half hour of daylight. The team supplements the time-lapse record by occasionally repeating shots at fixed locations in Iceland, Bolivia, the Canadian province of British Columbia and the French and Swiss Alps. Collected images are being used for scientific evidence and as part of a global outreach campaign aimed at educating the public about the effects of climate change. EIS imagery has appeared in time-lapse videos displayed in the terminal at Denver International Airport; in media productions such as the 2009 NOVA Extreme Ice documentary on PBS;“Extreme Ice” documentary and is the focus of the feature-length film Chasing Ice, directed by Jeff Orlowski, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in Utah on January 23, 2012. Major findings were published in 2012 in Ice: Portraits of the World’s Vanishing Glaciers by James Balog (Rizzoli Publishing).  History  Nature photojournalist James Balog founded the Extreme Ice Survey in 2007 after spending much of the previous two years photographing receding glaciers for National Geographic and The New Yorker. Balog saw extraordinary amounts of ice vanishing with shocking speed. Features that took centuries to develop were being destroyed much faster than scientific modeling had predicted, sometimes in just a few years—or even just a few weeks. Balog founded the EIS to provide visual evidence of the dramatic effects of global warming. The project ultimately evolved into an intensive team effort, bringing together journalists and scientists, artists and engineers.  Mission  The EIS aims to show epochal change happening within the time frame of human life, and to provide scientists with a photographic record to understand the mechanics and pace of glacial retreat and how it relates to climate change.  Fieldwork and equipment  The EIS team chose to put its time-lapse cameras — Nikon D200 DSLR cameras powered by a custom-made combination of solar panels, batteries and other electronics — at accessible and photogenic sites that represented regional conditions well, had high scientific value and were photographically and logistically manageable. Each camera system weighs 125-150 pounds or more and had to be secured with anchors and guy wires against winds up to 150 mph, as well as against temperatures as low as -40 °F, blizzards, landslides, torrential rain and avalanches. The cameras shot once every hour, in daylight hours, for approximately 8,000 images per camera per year. The total survey archives now include more than 800,000 frames. By capturing images in diverse locations throughout the Northern Hemisphere over several years, the EIS can provide a more complete picture of the effect of global warming across different geographic regions than previous ground-based, time-lapse studies. As of January 2012, the team has 27 cameras at 18 glaciers.  Project team  = Founder = The images of photojournalist James Balog have received international acclaim, including a Heinz Award, the Leica Medal of Excellence and the premier awards for both nature and science photography at World Press Photo in Amsterdam. Exhibitions of his images have been shown at more than 100 museums and galleries from Greece to Paris, New York to Los Angeles. He was the first photographer ever commissioned to create a series of stamps for the U.S. Postal Service; the 1996 release featured America’s endangered wildlife. Balog’s work has been published in numerous major magazines, including National Geographic, The New Yorker, Life, Vanity Fair, The New York Times Magazine, Audubon and Outside.

The half-life of 26Al is 7.17 years. This is far too short for the isotope to survive as a primordial nuclide, but a small amount of it is produced by collisions of atoms with cosmic ray protons. Decay of aluminium-26 also produces gamma rays and x-rays. The x-rays and Auger electrons are emitted by the excited atomic shell of the daughter 26Mg after the electron capture which typically leaves a hole in one of the lower sub-shells. Because it is radioactive, it is typically stored behind at least of lead. Contact with 26Al may result in radiological contamination necessitating special tools for transfer, use, and storage. Dating Aluminium-26 can be used to calculate the terrestrial age of meteorites and comets. It is produced in significant quantities in extraterrestrial objects via spallation of silicon alongside beryllium-10, though after falling to Earth, 26Al production ceases and its abundance relative to other cosmogenic nuclides decreases. Absence of aluminium-26 sources on Earth is a consequence of Earth's atmosphere obstructing silicon on the surface and low troposphere from interaction with cosmic rays. Consequently, the amount of 26Al in the sample can be used to calculate the date the meteorite fell to Earth. Occurrence in the interstellar medium The distribution of 26Al in Milky Way The gamma emission at 1809 keV was the first observed gamma emission from the galactic center. The observation was made by the HEAO-3 satellite in 1984. The isotope is mainly produced in supernovas ejecting many radioactive nuclides in the interstellar medium. The isotope is believed to provide enough heat to small planetary bodies so as to differentiate their interiors, such as has been the case in the early history of the asteroids 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta. This isotope also features in hypotheses regarding the equatorial bulge of Saturn's moon Iapetus. History Before 1954, the half-life of aluminium-26 was measured to be 6.3 seconds. After it was theorized that this could be the half-life of a metastable state (isomer) of aluminium-26, the ground state was produced by bombardment of magnesium-26 and magnesium-25 with deuterons in the cyclotron of the University of Pittsburgh. The first half-life was determined to be in the range of 106 years. The Fermi beta decay half-life of the aluminium-26 metastable state is of interest in the experimental testing of two components of the Standard Model, namely, the conserved-vector-current hypothesis and the required unitarity of the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix. The decay is superallowed. The 2011 measurement of the half life of 26mAl is 6346.54 ± 0.46(statistical) ± 0.60(system) milliseconds. In considering the known melting of small planetary bodies in the early Solar System, H. C. Urey noted that the naturally occurring long-lived radioactive nuclei (40K, 238U, 235U and 232Th) were insufficient heat sources. He proposed that the heat sources from short lived nuclei from newly formed stars might be the source and identified 26Al as the most likely choice. This proposal was made well before the general problems of stellar nucleosynthesis of the nuclei were known or understood. This conjecture was based on the discovery of 26Al in a Mg target by Simanton, Rightmire, Long & Kohman. Their search was undertaken because hitherto there was no known radioactive isotope of Al that might be useful as a tracer. Theoretical considerations suggested that a state of 26Al should exist. The life time of 26Al was not then known; it was only estimated between 104 and 106 years. The search for 26Al took place over many years, long after the discovery of the extinct radionuclide 129I (by Reynolds (1960, Physical Review Letters v 4, p 8)) which showed that contribution from stellar sources formed ~108 years before the Sun had contributed to the Solar System mix. The asteroidal materials that provide meteorite samples were long known to be from the early Solar System. The Allende meteorite, which fell in 1969, contained abundant calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs). These are very refractory materials and were interpreted as being condensates from a hot solar nebula. then discovered that the oxygen in these objects was enhanced in 16O by ~5% while the 17O/18O was the same as terrestrial. This clearly showed a large effect in an abundant element that might be nuclear, possibly from a stellar source. These objects were then found to contain strontium with very low 87Sr/86Sr indicating that they were a few million years older than previously analyzed meteoritic material and that this type of material would merit a search for 26Al. 26Al is only present today in the Solar System materials as the result of cosmic reactions on unshielded materials at an extremely low level. Thus, any original 26Al in the early Solar System is now extinct. To establish the presence of 26Al in very ancient materials requires demonstrating that samples must contain clear excesses of 26Mg /24Mg which correlates with the ratio of 27Al/24Mg. The stable 27Al is then a surrogate for extinct 26Al. The different 27Al/24Mg ratios are coupled to different chemical phases in a sample and are the result of normal chemical separation processes associated with the growth of the crystals in the CAIs. Clear evidence of the presence of 26Al at an abundance ratio of 5×10−5 was shown by Lee, et al. The value (26Al/27Al ∼ 5) has now been generally established as the high value in early Solar System samples and has been generally used as a refined time scale chronometer for the early Solar System. Lower values imply a more recent time of formation. If this 26Al is the result of pre-solar stellar sources, then this implies a close connection in time between the formation of the Solar System and the production in some exploding star. Many materials which had been presumed to be very early (e.g. chondrules) appear to have formed a few million years later (Hutcheon & Hutchison). Other extinct radioactive nuclei, which clearly had a stellar origin, were then being discovered. (t1/2=6.5x10^6 yr) That 26Al was present in the interstellar medium as a major gamma ray source was not explored until the development of the high-energy astronomical observatory program. The HEAO-3 spacecraft with cooled Ge detectors allowed the clear detection of 1.808 Mev gamma lines from the central part of the galaxy from a distributed of 26Al source. This represents a quasi steady state inventory corresponding to two solar masses of 26Al was distributed . This discovery was greatly expanded on by observations from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory using the COMPTEL telescope in the galaxy. Subsequently, the 60Fe lines (1.173 & 1.333 Mev) were also detected showing the relative rates of decays from 60Fe to 26Al to be 60Fe/26AL~0.11. In pursuit of the carriers of 22Ne in the sludge produced by chemical destruction of some meteorites, carrier grains in micron size, acid-resistant ultra-refractory materials (e.g. C, SiC) were found by E. Anders & the Chicago group. The carrier grains were clearly shown to be circumstellar condensates from earlier stars and often contained very large enhancements in 26Mg/24Mg from the decay of 26Al with 26Al/27Al sometimes approaching 0.2 These studies on micron scale grains were possible as a result of the development of surface ion mass spectrometry at high mass resolution with a focused beam developed by G. Slodzian & R.Castaing with the CAMECA Co. The production of 26Al by cosmic ray interactions in unshielded materials is used as a monitor of the time of exposure to cosmic rays. The amounts are far below the initial inventory that is found in very early solar system debris.

At present the order consists of some 16 families, a few of which, such as the Oncoceratidae, Brevicoceratidae, and Acleistoceratidae contain a fair number of genera each while others like the Trimeroceratidae and Archiacoceratidae are represented by only two or three (Sweet, 1964). Life reconstruction of Cyrtoceras sp  Physical characteristics The shells of oncocerids are primarily somewhat compressed cyrtoconic brevicones. More advanced forms include gyrocones, serpenticones, torticones, and elongate orthocones and cyrtocones, reflective of the different families and genera (Flower, 1950; Sweet, 1964). The siphuncle in the Oncocerida is commonly located at or near the ventral margin. Connecting rings are most commonly thin and structureless but in certain derived forms may become actinosiphonate with inwardly projecting radial lamellae. The juvenile segments in early genera are straight and tubular, with short orthochoanitic septal necks inherited from the Bassleroceratidae. Later in the mature stages of early forms and throughout in the more advanced the connecting rings are inflated with cyrtochoanitic septal necks, giving what can be described as a \\"beaded\\" or \\"ellipsoidal\\" appearance (Sweet, 1964). Evolution and diversity The Oncocerida are thought to be derived from the Bassleroceratidae through Graciloceras as a result of a thinning of the connecting rings in the siphuncle (Flower, 1976). Oncocerids reached their greatest generic diversity in the Middle Silurian with some 43 genera representing nine families (Sweet, 1964), the most at any time. Of these 43 or so genera, about 38 were new, a recovery from a precipitous decline in the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian. A second period of greater diversity occurred in the Middle Devonian with eight families represented by some 37 genera, following a second decline after the Middle Silurian. After this the order declined until its extinction in the Early Carboniferous (Mississippian). Near the beginning of the Devonian and well before its end, the Oncocerida gave rise to the Rutoceratidae (Flower, 1976; Kümmel, 1964), which form the root stock of the Nautilida, which among its members includes the modern Nautilus and Allonautilus. Distribution and range Oncocerids are well known as fossils from the later Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian in North America, Europe, and Australia, and to a lesser extent from parts of Asia, after which the order declined into the Mississippian and reached its end by the Pennsylvanian (late Carboniferous) (Flower, 1976; Sweet, 1964).

McIvor's first chance to shine came in the 1979 Texas Tech game when Coach Fred Akers used three quarterbacks to win 14-6. McIvor threw the game's only touchdown pass and most of the passing yards for Texas.http://stats.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/79/indgbg.htm#IGBG.PAS A few weeks later, after backup quarterback Jon Aune moved to defensive back, McIvor replaced Little in the TCU game, when Little left with sore ankles, leading the team on an 80-yard touchdown drive and running the offense for most of the second half. His first career start came the next week against Baylor and McIvor played well, throwing for 270 yards, then a Texas record, and 1 touchdown in leading the team to a 13-0 win. He started the last two games of the season losing to A&M; 13-7 and to Washington in the Sun Bowl 14-7. In 1980, he again entered the season as the back-up to Little. He saw mop-up action in the 35-0 blowout over Oregon State and came in for relief of Little in losses against SMU and Texas Tech.http://texastech.scout.com/2/1082260.html He nearly led the team back from a 24-0 deficit in the Tech game, until he was poked in the eye and had to leave the game.http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/tag/_/name/rick-mcivor He earned the starting job for the Houston game, which they won 15-13, but sat out the next two weeks due to an injury. He returned to share quarterback duties with Little for the losses to Baylor and Texas A&M; to end the season. When Little was injured during the last game of the season, McIvor was again named the starting quarterback for the bowl game, which they again lost, this time to North Carolina in the Bluebonnet Bowl. That year, he was the Southwest Conferences highest rated quarterback with a 121.8 rating. During the off- season, Little volunteered to move to wide receiver because he felt it would be his best shot at an NFL career,http://www.wacotrib.com/sports/texas_sports_hall_of_fame/hall-of-fame- little-groundbreaking-qb-at-all- levels/article_e0889bf1-f21b-5737-9d84-abe0cb5d10a0.html and McIvor became the starting quarterback for the 1981 season. After winning the first four games, including back-to-back wins over ranked Miami and Oklahoma, Texas was ranked #1. But McIvor's job was in danger after a disastrous 42–11 loss to unranked Arkansas in week 5. Texas won the next two games with McIvor under center, but he lost his position to walk-on Robert Brewer midway through the Houston game when he suffered an injury to his right shoulder and nerve damage to his neck. Texas was trailing when McIvor was pulled, but eventually closed with a 14-14 tie due to Brewer's efforts. It took him several games to recover from the injury and he threw only one more pass the rest of the season and it would more than 2 years before he would get a chance to start again.1981 Cotton Bowl Fact Sheet Just before the start of the 1982 season, McIvor suffered a knee injury in practice that would require surgery to repair damaged ligaments, so he redshirted the 1982 season. He missed the following spring practice because his grade point average had dropped below the requirement for upperclassmen and he had to drop out of school for a semester. He went home and worked on his father's ranch. In 1983, it appeared that McIvor would be the starting quarterback. But Todd Dodge was named the starter during summer practices after McIvor spent a couple of days in the hospital with an infected wrist and elbow. Later in the fall, a shoulder injury to Dodge in the final preseason scrimmage led to McIvor splitting time with his best friend Rob Moerschell in the first game of the season against Auburn. Despite an 80-yard touchdown pass McIvor threw in that game, one of the longest in Texas history, Moerschell emerged as the starter. Thanks to a head injury in the next game against North Texas, McIvor saw limited play for most of the season as the starting quarterback role went from Moerschell to Dodge and back to Moerschell. But, during the last game of the regular season, against in-state rival Texas A&M;, McIvor replaced Moerschell when the #2 Longhorns fell behind 14–0 and played spectacularly. He led the undefeated Longhorns to score 45 unanswered points, throwing for 170 yards and a record 4 touchdown passes without any turnovers. He played so well that he was named the starter in the following game, the 1984 Cotton Bowl. In his last game as a Longhorn, McIvor led #2 Texas against #7 Georgia in a game with National Championship implications. Texas held onto a small lead until late in the 4th quarter but a muffed punt return gave Georgia the opportunity it needed to score the game-winning touchdown. McIvor threw for 168 yards and 2 interceptions with no touchdowns. Later that day, #1 Nebraska was upset by #5 Miami, Fl, an outcome that would have secured Texas its 4th National Championship had they beaten Georgia. McIvor finished his career at Texas with a record of 8–5–1 as a starter, but was 0-3 in bowl games. =Records= * UT - Touchdown Passes, Game (4), tied with Randy McEachern and Clyde Littlefield, tied later by Peter Gardere, surpassed by James Brown in 1995 * UT - Passing yards, Game (270), surpassed by Donnie Little in 1980 * UT - Most attempts, Game (38), surpassed by Bret Stafford in 1986 Later life Having made an impression with his strong arm and clutch play in the Texas A&M; game, McIvor was selected 80th overall by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1984 NFL Draft.

It is a system of government where all rule equally. They originally intended to establish such a community in the United States, choosing a site on the banks of the Susquehanna River after considering other places such as Kentucky. By 1795 Southey had doubts about the viability of this and proposed moving the project to Wales. The two men were unable to agree on the location, causing the project to collapse. Others involved included the poet Robert Lovell and three of the Fricker sisters, Sara, Edith and Mary, who married the three poets, and George Burnett (who proposed unsuccessfully to another Fricker sister, Martha). Their friend Thomas Poole was not part of the scheme but considered moving to somewhere nearby, writing: Principles The Pantisocrats believed that contemporary society and politics were responsible for cultures of servitude and oppression.Morrow, John (1990). Coleridge's Political Thought, p. 8. St. Martin's Press, New York. Having abandoned these corrupting influences along with personal property for a fresh start in the wilderness, the Pantisocrats hoped that men might be governed by the “dictates of rational benevolence.” As spelled out by Southey, the utopian community he and Coleridge planned was to be built on two principles: \\"Pantisocracy\\" (meaning government by all) and \\"Aspheterism\\" (meaning general ownership of property).Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, vol. 1, p. 73. Houghton Mifflin & Co., Boston and New York. The scheme called for a small group of educated individuals to give up their possessions and labor together for the common good. Few regulations would be necessary to govern the colony and decisions would be made so as to avoid one man having more power than another. Coleridge envisioned Pantisocracy as a way to minimize the greed among men.Woodring, Carl R. Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge, p. 63. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison. Additionally, Coleridge and Southey hoped to enjoy a more relaxing existence than was possible in England, and expected that each member of the community would have to work just two to three hours per day to sustain the colony.MacGillivray, J.R., Ed. Malcolm Wallace (1931). \\"The Pantisocracy Scheme and Its Immediate Background\\" in Studies in English. The University of Toronto Press, Toronto. The Pantisocrats viewed their attempt as not only a search for personal domestic peace, but also as an attempt to change the status quo in England.Morrow, John (1990). Coleridge's Political Thought, p. 9. St. Martin's Press, New York. One influence on the plan was disillusionment with the French Revolution and with the current politics of England, from which Coleridge may have sought solace through a utopian escape. Coleridge viewed the utopian scheme as an experiment that, if successful, might be gradually extended to a larger citizenship.Sister Eugenia (1930). \\"Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts\\", in PMLA p. 1079. 28/1/2010 Coleridge also hoped that through a more active, natural lifestyle he would live a healthier and more wholesome existence with his family.Woodring, Carl R. (1961). Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge, p. 69. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison. Inspirations Like many utopian societies, the Pantisocracy envisioned by the members owed its origins to Plato's ideal commonwealth, envisioned in the later books of The Republic and in Critias. More modern examples for the Pantisocrats included Sir Thomas More's Utopia, Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, Tommaso Campanella's Civitas Solis, and the accounts of Cotton Mather. The Pantisocrats were also heavily influenced by contemporary travel accounts of the new world.Sister Eugenia (1930). \\"Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts\\", in PMLA p. 1069-1074. 28/1/2010 Many writers who visited the new world (including J. P. Brissot, Thomas Cooper and Joseph Priestley) described a fresh and inviting country, whose inhabitants were untainted by the evils of society. Coleridge and Southey pored over these and other accounts of the American continent. Beginnings As early as November 1793, Robert Southey was envisioning a utopia in the US.Southey, Rev. Charles Cuthbert, Ed. (1850). The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, vol. 1, p. 211. Longman, Brown, Greene, and Longmans, London. Coleridge's schoolfriend Robert Allen had become acquainted with Southey while at Oxford and introduced the two men while Coleridge was on a walking tour with another friend, Joseph Hucks. Southey would later write \\"that meeting fixed the future fortunes of us both\\". Coleridge extended his stay in Oxford for several weeks while the two men discussed the problems of the time and the possibility of setting up a utopian society in the United States, which Coleridge first dubbed \\"Pantocracy\\" then \\"Pantisocracy\\". Allen and Southey's friend George Burnett were early allies and when Coleridge and Huck departed for Wales, Southey and Burnett accompanied them part of the way. On their return journey to Oxford, Southey and Burnett discussed the practicalities of the scheme. Throughout July, Coleridge corresponded regularly with Southey about their plans (unfortunately, while many of Coleridge's letters to Southey have survived, only part of one of Southey's letters to Coleridge is known). Coleridge even went so far as to share his enthusiasm for Pantisocracy with many of the people he and Hucks met along the road, offending several listeners with their radical ideas. During the walking tour Coleridge also encountered an old flame, Mary Evans, and his interaction with her momentarily drove thoughts of Pantisocracy from his mind. On August 3, Coleridge and Hucks rejoined Southey in Bristol. In Bristol, Southey and Coleridge continued to flesh out their plans, and spoke openly of their radical ideas. One listener was John Poole, cousin of Tom Poole of Nether Stowey, who writes of his encounter with the two young men: \\"Each of them was shamefully hot with Democratic rage as regards politics, and both Infidel as to religion. I was extremely indignant...\\". During this time the young men also became acquainted with the family of Mrs. Fricker, a widow whose daughters seemed willing to join in the scheme (as Mrs. Southey and Coleridge).Beer, John, (2004). \\"Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, Oxford. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5888 Southey became interested in Edith and Coleridge began showing interest in Sara. Further planning and practical implications In the autumn of 1794, Coleridge began seriously to investigate the practical problems of setting up a community in America. During this time he encountered George Dyer, a student familiar with Priestley (who at the time was already living in Pennsylvania), and also spoke with a land agent. In a letter to Southey on September 6 he writes:Southey, Rev. Charles Cuthbert, Ed. (1850). The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, vol. 1, p. 193-196. Longman, Brown, Greene, and Longmans, London. Neither Coleridge nor Southey possessed the requisite wealth, but plans were laid for a spring departure in 1795. The young men hoped that other, wealthier immigrants who would join in the endeavor would be willing to fund it. Returning to Cambridge in late September, Coleridge began to spread word of the plan. Coleridge at this time envisioned the community including \\"twelve men with their families\\", among whom the costs would be split, with the wealthier members of the community making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members. Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among the families who were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge worried that they might already be deeply prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, vol. 1, p. 168. Houghton Mifflin & Co., Boston and New York. Disillusionment As the date set for departure arrived and the financial difficulties in undertaking the journey remained unsolved, the would-be emigrants began to lose excitement and resolve. Besides their lack of funds, other concerns challenged the Pantisocrats. Contrary to the glowing travel narratives that Coleridge pored over while researching the prospect of settling in America, other accounts of American life were less encouraging, and described a difficult and laborious existence.Sister Eugenia (1930). \\"Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts\\", in PMLA p. 1079-1081. 28/1/2010 In a review of Thomas Cooper’s Some Information Respecting America, (one of the positive accounts of the New World that Coleridge consulted) a reviewer describes Cooper and those like him as “rival auctioneers, or rather show-men, stationed for the allurement of incautious passengers. 'Pray, ladies and gentlemen, walk in and admire the wonders of Kentucky—Pray, stop and see the incomparable beauties of the Susquehanna.'” Coleridge also faced personal challenges in carrying out the scheme. He received a letter from Mary Evans which argued against the plan, and his feelings for her for a time swayed him against Pantisocracy. Learning that she had become engaged, Coleridge turned his attention back to Pantisocracy and Sara Fricker. Under pressure from Southey to act with regard to Sara (both because of the demands of Pantisocracy and also because she was being courted by other men), Coleridge married Sara in October 1795. As plans bogged down, Southey and Coleridge eventually reached an impasse. Coleridge, Southey and Burnett shared rooms in Bristol but the meticulous Southey grew worried by Coleridge's lifestyle and feared that finances were being left under his responsibility (he contributed four times more to their common funds than his roommates). Southey at one point advocated taking servants to the new world, a proposition Coleridge scoffed at. Southey and other would-be Pantisocrats also considered a less ambitious plan: the purchase of a common farm in Wales. Coleridge, still dreaming of the new world, felt that this compromise failed to meet the standards of Pantisocracy. In a letter to Southey he complains that private resources would not be abandoned at the farm in Wales and that, \\"In short, we were to commence partners in a petty farming trade.\\"Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, vol. 1, p. 140. Houghton Mifflin & Co., Boston and New York. By the winter of 1795, the dream of Pantisocracy had all but died out. Impact on Coleridge There are two of Coleridge’s poems that directly address the plans he and Southey were envisioning. \\"Pantisocracy,\\" a sonnet sent to Southey in a letter of September 18, 1794, was not published during Coleridge’s lifetime.Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. William Keach. (1997). The Complete Poems, p. 57-58. Houghton Mifflin & Co., Boston and New York. A second sonnet, \\"On the Prospect of Establishing a Pantisocracy,\\" has also been attributed to Coleridge, and was first published in 1826. Many of Coleridge's other works of the time implicitly suggest the New World, and may owe a debt to his musings over the Susquehanna.Cottle, Joseph. (1847). Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey, p. 22. Houlston and Stoneman, London. An early version of the poem \\"To a Young Ass\\" also makes mention of Pantisocracy.Woodring, Carl R. (1961). Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge, p. 70. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison. Pantisocracy presented Coleridge a practical outlet for ideas he had previously only considered theoretically.Colmer, John. Ed. R.L. Brett. (1971). '\\"Coleridge and Politics,\\" in Writers and Their Background: S.T. Coleridge p. 254 . G. Bell & Sons, London. While the scheme never produced an actual community, it did impact Coleridge's philosophical thinking. His lectures of the time reflect his Pantisocratic thinking on social relations and wealth. He wrote of the scheme years afterward that it was “a plan as harmless as it was extravagant” but it can be argued that much of the fantastic imagery and political thoughts present in his work owe a debt both to Pantisocracy and to the research he conducted in preparation for his voyage.Sister Eugenia (1930). \\"Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts\\", in PMLA p. 1084. 28/1/2010 On a literal level, perhaps the greatest impact Pantisocracy had on the young Coleridge was the addition of Sara Fricker (and their subsequent family) to his life.

It is situated west of the mouth of the Rio Yuma, near the Caribbean Sea. The word Yuma is an indigenous Taíno name. The village has a pleasant climate. It is peaceful and tranquil. A few miles west of the village is the Del Este National Park, one of the largest national parks in the country, with an area of 310 square kilometers. The bay of Boca de Yuma is used for fishing and boat trips. History =The Beginning of Boca de Yuma= The first families that settled the village of Boca de Yuma came from various regions of the Spanish colonial Captaincy General of Santo Domingo on Hispaniola. Perhaps one of the first persons to settle here was Pedro Sifuentes, nicknamed the Portugalete. He has also been referred to as the Dominican 'Robinson Crusoe' due to the many years of living alone here after the sinking of his ship in the adjacent Yuma Bay. =Forts and pirates= Boca de Yuma had a Spanish colonial fort overlooking the Yuma Bay. The fort held a highly defensible position, with the cannons as the main defense. The remains of a cannon is on the coastline, that is believed to be the same as the Archbishop Fernando Navarrete asked the King of Spain for, for the defense and protection of the Shrine of Our Lady of La Altagracia in Higüey. In 1877 an expedition organized by the baecista of Curaçao found cannons left underwater in Yuma Bay. They were placed as monuments on an ocean cliff where the community park and the historic lighthouse are located. Other guns and battleships remain on the Playa Blanca (White Beach). One of the great pirates of those times, who defended the poor, was a man named Roberto Cofresi Ramirez de Arellano, born in the coastal town of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. Deep below the river mouth there is a cave, where according to tradition the pirate ship \\"Cofresi\\" sank. In 1824, Roberto Cofresí engaged with a Spanish Commander in a fierce battle, after which Cofresí and his crew were captured. His death sentence took place on the morning of March 29, 1825, on the fields of Castillo San Felipe del Morro in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. =Port= Boca de Yuma was originally known as the \\"Port of Higüey.\\" Juan Ponce de León had his ship anchored in the Port of Higüey, and departed from here in 1508, for the conquest of Borinquen, Puerto Rico. In 1513 he left in search of the fountain of eternal youth, and instead made the discovery for subsequent colonization of Spanish Florida. Boca de Yuma was an important port in the victory over the English in 1655, the Battle of Sabana Real on January 21, 1691, and the Battle of Palo Hincado on November 7, 1808. Those were great military confrontations that changed the eventual history of the Dominican Republic. On October 29, 1808, the mouth of the Río Yuma at Boca de Yuma was the witness of the support sent by the Governor General Toribio Montes of Puerto Rico to the Port of Higüey for the Battle of Palo Hincado. The material, which has had been embarked in a Brigantine and a goélette included: two small boats equipped with guns, four hundred rifles with bayonets, and two hundred sabers. There were also two hundred volunteers, the majority emigrants from Puerto Rico. =Coast= On March 4, 1919 the landing began of American sailors to the port of Boca de Yuma from San Pedro de Macoris in the goélette Maria Consuelo, headed by Mr. Catalino Vidal. They settled where the first school was, close to the boat launch beach. Later they built the first concrete school here, named after John F. Kennedy in honor of the Thirty-Fifth President of the United States (1961–1963). In 1966, The Incorporated Club Nautical of Santo Domingo installed an extension of the team games recreation area on the coast. It was initiated by Don Alberto Bonetti Burgos, who traveled frequently to Boca De Yuma for fishing and hunting doves.  Boca de Yuma in the 21st Century  In 2008 the population was about 2,400 people. This hidden paradise remains a humble village surrounded by beautiful beaches. It is a town of simple individuals, and modest workers. Boca de Yuma is within short distance of La Altagracia province, one-hour drive from Punta Cana, thirty minutes from La Romana city and an hour thirty minutes from the capital city. If you ever step a foot in Boca de Yuma you will be wrap by numerous attractions, for example hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, photography, beaches, caves and national park. The national park is home of different species of birds and animals of the region. A navigable river of 1.5 km in length, which if you travel by boat up the river it reveals the beautiful landscapes and the caves where according to tradition the pirate Roberto Cofresí took refugee and hid his treasure. Another place to visit is The Cave Bernard with beautiful stalagmites and stalactites, the Cave of Bernard, that name by being inside the property of John Bernard one of the first founders of the community. The dictator Trujillo Leonida to provide water to all the people built the public water fountain (La Llave Publica). From John Bernard Park off the tip of the virgin you can see a beautiful panorama of the bay, a euphoric view of the beach, White Beach, Cape San Rafael, Cape Engaño and a beautiful view of the southern part of the town.

It is located in the western part of the state, 24 km west of Tuxtla Gutierrez covering parts of the Depresión Central (Central Depression) and the Montañas del Norte (Northern Mountains). It is bordered to the north by Tecpatán, to the east by Berriozábal, Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Suchiapa, to the south by Villaflores and to the west by Jiquipilas and Cintalapa. The name comes from the Nahoa language and means ‘forest of ocozote trees’. ‘De Espinosa’ was added in 1928 to honor Raymundo Enríquez Espinosa who was the first governor of the state of Chiapas. Ocozocoautla gained city status in 1926. The climate is warm and humid and the vegetation is mostly high and medium rainforest. As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 82,059, up from 72,426 as of 2005. As of 2010, the city of Ocozocoautla de Espinosa had a population of 39,180.

Carnival de Ocozocoautla The carnival of this town is based on native Zoque traditions that date back to pre-Hispanic times and Christian traditions brought over by the Spanish. It celebrates both the proximity of Holy Week and the resurrection of the land and of life. It begins the Sunday before Ash Wednesday. On this day, ‘’’cohuinás,’’’ who are people responsible for organizing and coordinating religious activities in the town, gather before the patron saint of the town, Saint John the Baptist to announce the beginning of the carnaval, which is primarily a dance festival. On Monday, a large parade is held for about 3 hours, in which various groups compete for recognition as “best-dressed,” “best-organized” etc. They also toss talc and water onto each other no matter how well dressed they happen to be. Then the people greet the cohuinás who receive them with chocolate, 2 types of bread called “pukzinú” (made with cinnamon and squash seeds) and “ponzoquí” (a bread doll cooked on a comal), as well as distilled spirits. On Tuesday, the cohuinás dance the “Baile de Plaza” also known as the “Baile Grande” or the “Danza del los Enlistaonados”. The dance is performed once in each of the three main plazas of the town. This dance has pre-Hispanic origins and honors “Tajaj Jama” or ‘Father Sun.’ Since the Spanish Conquest, European Christian characters have been added to this dance, including “el Mahoma”, an Arab figure who represents evil because of his opposition to Christianity, David, who represents good because he protects his people against Goliath and “el Caballo” (the Horse), a character whose mission is to help David. In the dance, the three battle until David triumphs. On Tuesday, the Dance of the Tiger is performed. Two tiger and two monkeys (male and female) are accompanied by a hunter, soldiers, “tatamonos” and “arreadores.” The tigers hunt the monkeys as the hunter hunts the tigers. Accompanied by tambourines, marimbas and flutes, the dance ends when the monkeys triumph over the tigers with the help of the hunter . Unlike most carnivals, the events do not end at midnight start of Ash Wednesday. On this day, all participants and visitors to the Carnival are purified with a “bath” using “zapoyal”, a powder extracted from a yellow pod-shaped fruit. On Thursday, there is a ceremonial “robbery” of the pig’s head that adorned the servant of “el Mahoma”. Then there is a dinner with marimba music. As part of this event, new people are chosen to play the various roles for next year’s Carnival .

He is remembered chiefly for his contributions to powered flight. 1914 photo of Ellehammer's coaxial helicopter hovering Following the end of his apprenticeship as a watchmaker, he moved to Copenhagen where he worked as an electronics mechanic before establishing his own company in 1898. In the beginning he produced cigarette machines, beverage machines and other electronic machinery. In 1904 he produced his first motorcycle, the Elleham motorcycle. It's an oddity that the design of the Elleham motorcycle is of step-tru type with the engine situated beneath the seating, hence predating the Vespa Scooter with 40 years. In 1903–1904 Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles fitted with single-cylinder Peugeot Frères engines to build the world's first air- cooled radial engine, a three-cylinder engine by utilizing Peugeot Frères cylinders and -heads in a home-cast engine block. The initial engine proved soon too weak and homemade cylinders with greater volume were fitted on an even bigger block which eventually brought him into the air. The original engine wasn't abandoned but saved for later use, which eventually happened when he had a flirt with helicopters: The helicopter experiments are known and photographically documented, but late in the century a down-scaled model of his helicopter was found deep in storage and it had a relatively small three- cylinder radial engine fitted which is considered being reuse of his original engine, hence the first functioning radial engine still exists and is displayed at the technology museum of Elsinore (Helsingör) where it is started up on a daily basis! The know-how from the three-cylinder was used as the basis for a yet more powerful five-cylinder model in 1907. This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free-flight hops as mentioned below. In 1905, he constructed a monoplane, and in the following year a \\"semi- biplane\\". In this latter machine, he made a tethered flight on 12 September 1906.1935 photo of Ellehammer's disc-rotor compound helicopter model Ellehammer's later inventions included a successful triplane and helicopter. His helicopter was a coaxial machine. A famous photo shows it hovering in 1914, though there is no evidence that it was successful in achieving horizontal flight. Ellehammer later studied a disc-rotor configuration - a compound helicopter with coaxial blades that extended from the hub for hover, and retracted for high speed vertical flight. Although a wind tunnel model was constructed, there's no evidence that anything more was studied. The initial experiments was done on a circular track attached to a central pole and constructed on a small island quite distant from Copenhagen where he lived by his workshop construction motorcycles and numerous devices. Once experiencing the first short lift offs he found time had come to move flight experiments close to Copenhagen. However with the workshop not located to the given 'airstrips' used he was forced to incorporate a folding wing for collapsing his second aircraft during transport out of town. As the first design was quite kite-like with the pilot and engine hanging separately to balance the aircraft, Ellehammer invented the UL-type motorised hang glider and the detail of foldable wings was probably decades prior to any other as the contemporary aircraft was rigid boxkite like biplanes. In 1986, Ellehammer was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

The novel takes place in Washington D.C., following the personal journey of a middle-aged, gay man dealing with the death of his mother. The novel received the 2007 Stonewall Book Award. Plot The narrative takes place in a predominantly gay neighborhood in Washington D.C. near the famous Dupont Circle. The story focuses on the exploits of a middle-aged, gay man who has recently moved to the city after the death of his mother. The novel follows this protagonist as he goes through the grieving process, holding true to the belief our deceased loved ones stay with us forever, or at least as long as we continue to grieve for them. Considering the novel's exploration of the complex and highly personal emotion of grief the title seems simple, yet remains effective. The protagonist convinces himself the emotion has become one of the major aspects of his life as a survivor. In essence, he lives to grieve both his mother and the numerous gay friends he lost during the 1980s AIDS epidemic. Characters frequently debate grief at various instances. Some of these individuals find the emotion unnecessary baggage. The protagonist refuses to accept this argument; he feels strongly that grief provides a crucial link between the living and the dead. The novel opens with a first- person narrator, a nameless, middle-aged, gay man. He has decided to take a teaching position in Washington D.C. He starts his journey waiting for his flight during a layover in Atlanta. Sitting in the departure lounge, he can’t help but think about his late mother. He reminisces how his life used to revolve around her when she was terminally ill. He remembers how he lacked any serious social life because he would spend every weekend with her after picking her up from the nursing home. After she passed, he realized a change in scenery was in order. His life in Florida had become hollow and depressing. The narrator arrives at his new residence on N Street N.W. to discover his landlord and future roommate is out of town. He has mixed emotions about having the new house to himself on his arrival. He enjoys the solitude, but feels a bit lonely. He takes time to observe the furniture, art work, and architecture of his new residence, as well as the exteriors of the other residential buildings throughout the neighborhood. Overall, he rather likes his new environment. During his first night in the house he comes across a book in his room entitled, Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters. The work consists of numerous letters written by the former first lady after the death of her husband. The narrator relates deeply to the grief Mary Todd Lincoln expresses throughout the pages of the text. After her husband died, she no longer had a stable home; she simply wandered the world in a permanent state of mourning. The narrator continuously reads this book throughout the novel; comparing Mary Todd Lincoln's suffering to that of his own. During his first few days alone in the house, he encounters numerous interesting locals around N Street. He meets a homeless man who works as a con-artist, telling people he needs money to take his nonexistent wife to the hospital. He also notices the handsome, yet reclusive, military veteran who cleans leaves off the sidewalk and receives helpful advice from the homosexual couple who live in the townhouse beneath him. The landlord soon returns from his business trip and introduces himself to the narrator. Similar to the protagonist, this character also remains nameless. The landlord is also gay, middle-aged, and currently single. The two men acquaint themselves and discuss current events taking place in the city. Apparently, a racial schism has broken out between blacks and whites after the mistreatment of a local African American politician. The narrator realizes he has picked a very tumultuous time to move to the nation's capitol. After getting settled, the narrator decides to visit his friend, Frank, who recommended him for the teaching position. Frank is also gay; however, he behaves far more flagrantly than the narrator or the landlord. During their visit the two discuss the death of the narrator's mother and the hardship of living as middle-aged gay men. Frank also mentions he has a new boyfriend, a handsome and muscular young man he refers to as the Lug. Desperate for the two of them to meet, Frank suggests the three of them should go out to a movie. The narrator declines, explaining he would rather explore the more intellectual aspects of his new city. Over the next couple of weeks he peruses the numerous museums and evening concerts Washington D.C. has to offer. He enjoys the cultural experience, but regrets having to do it alone. Walking through the streets alone at night tends to remind him of the grief he feels about his mother. One morning, after the landlord has left for work, the narrator discovers the man keeps his dog, Biscuit, cooped up in the study all day. He opens the door in hopes that the dog will come out, only to realize the animal enjoys her confinement. The narrator begins liberating the dog from the study on a regular basis and grows fond of her company. He keeps this secret from the landlord, worried it will upset the man. As the days turn to months, the narrator and his landlord develop a platonic friendship with one another. They share meals together and frequently discuss the local gay community. The landlord reveals himself to be a very popular individual on N Street. Unfortunately, personal issues have driven him to leave his previous social life behind. He admits to having been romantically involved with a member of the gay couple living beneath them. The relationship ended badly and the landlord finds it difficult to socialize while his ex-lover lives happily with another man. Nevertheless, the landlord continues to post personal ads in the local newspaper with the hope of attracting a new boyfriend. With time the narrator grows comfortable in his teaching position at the local university. His course focuses on literature specifically relating to homosexuality. He decides to reference the Mary Todd Lincoln book by comparing the assassination of Abraham Lincoln to the homosexual AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. This analogy angers one of his students, who viciously argues gays had a choice while Lincoln did not. The narrator proceeds to end the discussion by stating that “AIDS is dead,” considering it was primarily a homosexual disease, which will never impact the remaining population on such a high level. Few middle-age American homosexuals exist as a result of the 1980s epidemic. Such thoughts remind him of the numerous gay friends he lost to the virus. Just for living through the decade, he feels very much like a survivor. The narrator realizes he harbors a great deal of grief not just for his late mother, but for the many gay friends he lost during the 1980s. A few days later, the narrator encounters the belligerent student at the Metropolitan Museum. The student explains he takes the discussion of AIDS personally, because he had a gay brother who died from the virus. Their parents were appalled by their son's homosexuality, so he tended to his dying brother alone. The student quickly excuses himself, but leaves the narrator with many thoughts about his deceased gay friends and the choices they had made. One day while liberating Biscuit from the study, the narrator comes across a photo album. Flipping through the pages he notices his landlord knew his late friend, Nick. The two discuss their mutual friend in detail. Nick was a beautiful young man who the narrator had known in New York City several years ago. Nick was one of the many AIDS victims during the 1980s. The landlord explains that Nick's mother lives alone in Washington, not far from their house. The narrator pays her a visit and the two end up spending the day together. Over dinner, the two discuss grief and the impact it has had on both of their lives. In the end, they both agree mourning for lost loved ones remains one of the most human qualities on earth. As spring approaches, the narrator's teaching position ends and he prepares for his departure. Both his landlord and Frank encourage him to stay in Washington, assuring him the transition would be beneficial. Nevertheless, the narrator feels he must return to his house in Florida. He still has emotional issues he needs to deal with before he can truly move on with his life. Shortly before leaving, the narrator confesses to Frank he had lied to his mother about his sexual orientation. Allowing his mother to die ignorant of his homosexuality fills him with the grief he carries everyday of his life. Upon returning to his Florida home he finds the grief to be overwhelming. He turns to pray in a hope God will bless the spirits of his deceased father and mother. Characters in \\"Grief\\" Narrator - The novel's main character is a nameless middle-aged homosexual who has recently lost his mother. He moves to Washington DC to start his life over again and begins teaching a class about AIDS at a local university. During his stay, he examines his surroundings and uses them to provide insight into his own life experience. Throughout his stay in Washington, the narrator reflects on his views on grief. A prevailing thought he seems to cling to is that grief is a way of keeping your loved ones with you and maintaining a connection with them. The narrator fears that if he moves past his grief, he will no longer have a relationship with the dead and will lose the intimacy he developed with the deceased while they were alive. Landlord - The narrator's landlord is a nameless, handsome, middle-aged homosexual who pointedly maintains a distance between his tenant and himself. Upon meeting him, the narrator states that “he reminded me of an older America that had never changed its values of thrift, cleanliness, and order” (39). The landlord seems to have given up on life and on finding a significant other and often makes discouraging, negative remarks to the narrator when the narrator suggests attending particular social events. At one point, the narrator observes that “at fifty-five things had stopped happening to him... or rather: Everything that did happen to him had happened before--many, many times” (393). Frank - Frank is a sarcastic yet insightful friend of the narrator. He seeks to help the narrator overcome his grief and move on with his life. While the narrator argues that grief maintains a dead person's “presence on earth” (18), Frank argues that regardless of whether or not you grieve for the deceased, they are gone and there is no bringing them back. He helps the narrator interpret the actions of his landlord and also assists him in understanding the narrator's own emotions, his relationship with his mother, his need to be needed, even his relationship with his landlord's dog. Towards the end of the novel, it is revealed that Frank has cancer, and that his days are numbered. Nick's Mother - Nick's mother (nameless) was a mutual friend of the narrator and the narrator's landlord. She and the narrator trade their individual views on grief and reminisce about her son, who died of AIDS several years prior. While the narrator seems to harbor more romantic views on grief and the dead, Nick's mother entertains a more scientific view, which is illustrated when she states that “when we die, our bodies and brains have stopped. Hence there is no consciousness. Hence we cannot wake up. It's merely a false extrapolation people want to make because they cannot bare the thought of their own extinction” (117). Nick - Nick is a mutual friend of the narrator and the narrator's landlord. Nick believed strongly in the power of the mind to alter one's individual reality and learnt Silva Mind Control and how to walk on hot coals. He put a lot of energy into maintaining a healthy body, for example, he stayed out of the sun and only drank bottled water. Since he died of AIDS at an early age, the narrator views his work on his mind and body as futile. Narrator's Mother - The narrator's mother is recently deceased and spent the last part of her life in a nursing home where her son would often visit her. She and the narrator developed an especially intimate relationship during her final years and the narrator continues to actively grieve for her throughout the novel. Biscuit - Biscuit is the landlord's neglected dog and is often compared to the narrator's mother and is later compared to the narrator himself. Mary Todd Lincoln - Throughout the novel, the narrator reads the letters of Mary Todd Lincoln and her story exerts great influence on him and his views on grief. In particular, the narrator is interested in the way Lincoln reacts to the deaths of her loved ones. After her husband died, Lincoln seemed to believe “that any attempt to be happy was beside the point, since she was only waiting to be reunited with her husband and children in the afterlife” (68). At one point the narrator states that “the letters of Mrs. Lincoln were starting to be the reference for everything [he] noticed” (68). He is fascinated with her, and her personal story is an integral part of his. Washington D.C. - The narrator often analyzes the history and character of Washington D.C. throughout the novel. At one point, the narrator remarks that Washington is “the perfect city for grief: like walking through a cemetery” (66). In many ways, he has a more intimate relationship with the city than he does with individuals. Major Themes =Struggles and Hardships= This novel exemplifies the struggles and hardships of being gay and living in society at the same time. The narrator alludes to this during the course of his thoughts. He feels as though the world and society misconstrue what it actually means to be gay. According to everyone else, their life does not define normal. Being in Washington D.C., within a gay community, the narration shows how the hardship can only be mitigated if one surrounds one's self with similar people. The narrator, unable to come to terms with being gay, cannot openly display his preferences and has subsequent actions in reaction to this feeling. He goes to gay clubs but makes sure that he is inconspicuous; therefore people will not think he is a regular. Another subject brought up is the guilt he feels when he does not tell his mother that he is actually a homosexual, even when she blatantly asked it of him before she died. He feels guilt and despair when realizing his mother “had the misfortune to become dependent on a child who was a closeted homosexual, who had kept his real life from her for years, so that when he took care of her there was nothing but him and her – no life, no family of his own, nothing but his own solitude” (121). The narrator clearly explains that he feels like he causes the death of his mother because he was filled with despair of not being able to come to terms with being an openly homosexual person. The narrator, a professor at a local college, has a conversation one day with a student, trying to explain the difficulties concerning gays and wanting love and companionship. Frank concludes that gays are no different from regular humans by saying that the reason why homosexuals are so promiscuous is because “they were looking for love... [and] they thought they could get love from sex” (77). The student responds by stating that sex gave them AIDS and that “they should have known” better than to have sex promiscuously. The situation introduces confusion outsiders are often met with when trying to understand the gay culture. The student does not understand the thought process of homosexuals, who are only looking for love and life as any regular human desire. The student exemplifies the idea of society unable to accept and understand homosexuals, which is brings about the inability to accept gay culture. The idea of struggling to come to terms and the hardships of being able to be free to display sexual preferences within society are prevalent through the narrator and his actions. =Mortality of a Middle Aged Man= The theme of middle aged morality also come into play within the novel. As being survivors of the AIDS epidemic, the narrator, Frank and the landlord feel a sense of guilt and grief of out surviving many their common friends and lovers. Because of this, it prevents the narrator and the landlord ability to form healthy relationships with other men, because they are scarred from the hurt. The landlord spends a majority of the story putting ads into newspapers and blind dating many men who always turn out to be much too young and never looking for commitment. The explanation for wanting to put in ad in to the personal is stated by Frank. “Now we realize we’re not looking for sex anymore – we’re looking for fidelity. Tenderness! Intimacy! And that’s why he’s going to put an ad in the Personals” (55). The combination of out surviving many good friends has put the landlord at a struggle because he no longer knows where to look, to find older men that are his age. Many of them died from AIDS during the epidemic or continually look toward younger men who will satisfy their needs without the threat of commitment. This chronic loneliness that both the narrator and the landlord suffer through creates unrest among the two of them. Their only desire is to live their lives with someone to serve as company and love. =Loss of a Loved One= During the course of the novel, the concept of stages of grief is introduced. The stages are denial, anger, depression, and acceptance. The narrator, as well as other characters in the story, slowly passes through these stages in trying to deal with death. =Premature Death= During the story, the theme of dealing with grief overcomes the narrator, the landlord and Frank. Premature death grief results from the guilt that they try to deal with because of the AIDS epidemic. Many of their friends, for example one named Nick is overcome by the disease. When told about his HIV, Nick “looked like a deer caught in a car’s headlights for weeks... he even chased the doctor who had given him the news into a grocery store...one day and stood there in Produce screaming at him that he was wrong” (115). The idea of dealing with someone who should not have died is something that all of the homosexual men have to deal with because of AIDS. Along with not wanting to deal with the actual past events, they also become angered and depressed. The narrator explains the idea of trying to accept the death of someone who was not supposed to die. “Our age, our solitary status, the fact that we had survived something so many friends of ours had not... was one reason no doubt I simply walked around the halls but never touched a human being: the presence of the dead” (73). The sense of grief that they feel is one in which they are guilty, bearing down the weight of something that should have happened to them, but rather it did not. In that way, their grief remains constant, unable to be forgotten or to be accepted fully. Another example of this idea of grief is introduced by to the narrator. A student one day, while in a museum, explains to the narrator that his brother had died of AIDS. He tries to rationalize the fact that the person who died would want others to move on. “My brother would have wanted me to, I’m sure of that. My brother loved life. That’s why he got killed” (102). While the student seems to be able to rationalize and come to terms with a premature death, the narrator and the landlord seem to be unable to withdraw themselves from the situation in which was almost their own fate. They happened to be the lucky ones, and this trait to not have died from AIDS, while so many others did is the guilt they hold within themselves. =Family Member Death= The biggest theme in the story is one about the death of a family member. The narrator's mother is the single reason why he takes a visit to Washington D.C. in order to try to work through the grief of losing his mother. Being the sole caretaker of his mother, he feels as though he “kept her alive longer than she wanted to be” because of the fact that “families often hang on to [them] because they cannot let them go” (122). Grief, in this sense, is an overwhelming feeling of loss and despair, because the depression one goes through by not having someone they love around anymore as well the inability to accept death as a natural course of life. In order to work through his despair, the narrator finds ways in order to lessen the pain and to transfer some of the guilt he is feeling. He turns to roaming around Washington D.C. and conversing with his friend, Frank that “there are a lot of people who never get over certain things” like grief for example. “The past becomes their home. The dead become more real to them than the living – because there are more of the dead. They miss the dead, and when that happens, life stops” (21). This explanation perfects the theme of death of a family member. It helps to describe what happens when grief overpowers one's emotions and the reasons why one cannot overcome the death of a person. This is also a prevalent situation when the narrator parallels his life to that of Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Adams. Throughout the story, while reading the diary of Mary Todd Lincoln, titled Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters, the narrator makes connections between his grief and that of which Mary Todd Lincoln went through when her husband, Abraham Lincoln, was assassinated. Mary Todd Lincoln “grieved till she died – in a more ostentatious manner – who, you might say, tried to move on and couldn’t” (20). Henry Adams, who had to deal with the suicide of his wife, went through a similar situation. He tried to move on with his life “but when someone asked him to speak to a historical society years later, he turned and said, ‘But didn’t you know? I’ve been dead for fifteen years” (86). Both Henry Adams and Mary Todd Lincoln felt as if their life was cut short when their loved ones died without them. These feelings mirror what the narrator feels when his mother dies. With the guilt and the despair of missing his mother, the narrator feels as though his life is gone as well, even if he still is physically living. He wonders within his head one day while teaching if “[the students] will look up across the table and discover that their teacher is also dead” (75). The idea that grief overtakes someone's life is the common theme as seen with the example of the narrator, Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Adams. Grief comes to be the idea that one cannot overcome the idea of living without someone they love because “after someone you love dies, you are homeless, really, because your home was once with them” (142). This theme is the overpowering theme and motif throughout the story. Literary significance and reception Holleran's novel, Grief, had a great initial reception among gay literature critics. Even popular critics commemorated Grief for its craftsmanship and the intense themes it evokes within the story. For example, \\"Andrew Holleran's novel Grief could be to fiction what Joan Didion's best- selling 2005 memoir, The Year of Magical Thinking, was to non-fiction: A hit about how we consciously and unconsciously cope with the death and absence of someone we love. Grief, like Magical Thinking, is tempting to read in one sitting. Instead, it should be savored, because its emotional theme and elegiac tone are mesmerizing.\\"J. Ford Huffman (USA Today) *\\"The parallels between Grief 's emotionally immured protagonist and Mary Lincoln, ravaged and ultimately destroyed by grief over her husband's death, are evident but not overplayed. And the narrator's decision as to how to live the remainder of his life seems as etched in stone as the words he reads on the city's monuments. Still, in the end, Holleran's moving novel is mostly about human resilience and hope; our enduring need to love, despite our losses. The beautiful life is brief: all the more reason to embrace it.\\" by Elizabeth Hand (Washington Post) *\\"It is a testament to Holleran’s extraordinary skill that out of such mundane details he has assembled a story resonant with the tragedies of three American centuries. Grief captures the heartbreak of a generation-plus of gay men, men now well advanced in middle age, many of whom after the carnage of the plague can scarcely believe that they themselves are still alive.\\" by Lewis Gannet (Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide) *\\"Holleran handles a sensitive topic with nuance and care, peppering his narrative with discriminating observations about sex, love, life, death - and grief. Whether your husband is assassinated beside you as you sit watching a third-rate play or whether you are infected in a moment of sexual passion by a fatal virus, life has way of suddenly flipping so that you can end up dying internally, even spiritually, while still being physically alive.\\" by Michael Leonard (Curled Up With a Good Book) Allusions and References =Allusions to Other Works= *Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters by Justin and Linda Levitt Turner (references made throughout the novel) *Green Mansions by W.

Early life From approximately 16 through 21, he worked as a con artist, operated a card-cheating ring, a shoplifting gang and a pick-pocketing ring which bilked dozens of casinos, corporations and even at least one Mafia family. Transition into the magical arts Sometime around 2000 he began to adapt his talents from that of a criminal to the skills of a conjurer and slowly transitioned out of an illegal lifestyle over the next couple of years. Since then his magic has taken him on to perform in 17 countries across 4 continents (including television shows in the United States, China, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom and several others). He has probably best known for his feats of mentalism, but also often mixes sword swallowing, stunts, escapes, magic and his unique brand of humor in to his stage performances.> Guinness World Records he has broken 12 Guinness records. They include records for things such as escapes, sword swallowing, fire manipulation, feats of strength, and card manipulation. He usually performs these stunts for publicity or as the climax of his television specials. Lecturing Since his transition from a grifter to a performer he has also gone on to be an anti-fraud expert. The stories from his early years along with tips on how to protect yourself, information about fraudulent activities, and demonstrations of many of these feats were put together for his keynote speaking engagements.

The expression was a play on the popular song, \\"Roamin' in the Gloamin'\\" and was used in the lead paragraph of a story about the game written by Earl Hilligan for the Associated Press. The play The Pittsburgh Pirates had led the National League for much of the 1938 season, but when the final month of the season came, the Pirates began to falter. By the time they came to Chicago late in September for a three-game series, the Chicago Cubs were one and a half games behind the Pirates in the standings. The Cubs won the first game of the series 2–1, behind the pitching of Dizzy Dean, who a year after an arm injury was past his prime. Dean relied on his experience and grit to defeat the Pirates and would later call it the greatest outing of his career. The victory cut the Pirates' lead to a half game and set the stage for one of baseball's most memorable moments. The game on September 28, 1938, reached the bottom of the ninth inning with the score tied at five runs apiece. With darkness descending on a Wrigley Field that would not have artificial lighting for another 50 years, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning would be the last to be played. At the time, suspended game rules did not provide for suspending games due to darkness. The game would have to have been replayed in its entirety the following day, prior to the scheduled third game of the series. Hartnett came to bat with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness. Before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers for a game-winning home run, the stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Aftermath As a result of the shot, the Cubs vaulted into first place. They won the next day's scheduled game over the Pirates 10–1, completing a three-game sweep of the Bucs, and would clinch the pennant in St. Louis three days later. The Cubs would finish the season 89–63, with the Pirates two games behind at 86–64. That was the high point of the Cubs season, as they were swept in the 1938 World Series by the New York Yankees, their fourth World Series loss in ten years. For the Pirates, 1938 marked the closest they would come to going to the World Series between 1927 and 1960, as the team would slip to sixth place the following year, with average seasons in the early 1940s and a late pennant race in 1948 only to become one of baseball's worst teams from 1949 until 1956, not contending for the National League pennant again until the late 1950s. \\"Roamin' in the Gloamin'\\" was a popular song dating to 1911, written and recorded by Harry Lauder. \\"Gloaming\\" is a regional dialect term of Scots origin denoting \\"twilight\\". Writers picked up on these facts and Hartnett's clutch hit became known in Cubs lore as the \\"Homer in the Gloamin'\\".

The son of former Kerry Gaelic footballer Seán Walsh, he has played Gaelic football at club level with the Kerins O'Rahilly's club team and at inter-county level with the Kerry senior football team. Walsh played Australian rules football in the Australian Football League with and . Gaelic football =Minor and under-21= It was clear from an early stage that Walsh was a talented footballer. He was a star player for the Kerry team which reached the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final in 2006. He made his debut for the Kerry seniors in the 2007 National Football League, coming on as a substitute wing-forward on March 11 against Limerick. Kerry went on to win the 2007 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship although Walsh did not appear in any championship game. In 2008, Walsh won the All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship with Kerry. =Kerry= In 2008, Walsh was selected in the team for the first game of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship following some impressive NFL performances in the full-forward line. Walsh made his championship debut came against Clare in the Munster Senior Football Championship, scoring a point. He did not start in the Munster final, which Kerry lost to Cork, but came on as a substitute for the last few minutes. He regained his place and a number of impressive performances saw him named as All Stars Young Footballer of the Year. Later in the year, having resisted previous approaches from the Australian Football League, Walsh agreed to spend one week of preseason training with Australian Rules Football club, St Kilda. Players' agent Ricky Nixon described it as a 'big coup' for the AFL and said '\\"I can’t tell you if he'll want to play or stay or if he’ll be good enough but he’s definitely one of the best talents that I’ve seen.\\" However, Walsh later withdrew from the original trial and did not travel to Australia before the recruitment deadline, although he accepted an invitation to spend some time training with St Kilda. In 2009, Walsh suffered injury in the early part of the championship, which saw Kerry knocked out of Munster by Cork. Kerry came through the qualifiers to meet Dublin in the All-Ireland quarter-final, but Walsh was not on top form and was replaced before half-time. He was dropped from the team but came on as a substitute during the second half of the semi- final, and a more impressive performance saw him regain his place for the final. In the 2009 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, in which Kerry overcame Cork, Walsh notched up four points from play (two with each foot). Australian rules football =St Kilda= In October 2009, Walsh finally agreed to sign a two year AFL contract in 2009, with St Kilda general manager Matthew Drain saying that \\"he has enormous talent to become an important player for St Kilda\\". In October 2010, Walsh returned to Ireland to line out for the Irish international rules team in the 2010 International Rules Series, held at the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick. Ireland lost the first test of 2010. =Sydney Swans= In October 2011, Walsh requested and received a trade to the Sydney Swans and was selected for Ireland for the 2011 International Rules Series against Australia. Walsh was given the number 17 guernsey, vacated by the retirement of Tadhg Kennelly, who was a team-mate of Walsh's at Kerry in 2009. Walsh made his senior debut on Saturday 19 May 2012 against , kicking two goals as the Swans won by 101 points. In 2013, he tore three hamstring tendons from a bone. At the conclusion of the 2014 AFL season, Walsh informed Sydney that he would return to Ireland. Return to the Kerry team Kerry recalled Walsh for the 2015 National Football League. He played in six of Kerry's games in the Springs. He played his first Munster championship game since the 2009 when he came on as a sub in the semi-final win over Tipperary. He later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final win over Kildare. He played in four of Kerry's 2016 National Football League campaign, but left the panel before the start of the championship. Selector Mikey Sheehy later admitted this was a mistake, saying \\"we kind of threw him in at the deep end\\". In September 2018, veteran Kerry forward Kieran Donaghy retired. The same week Walsh scored 2–2 in a county championship meeting with Dr Crokes. In October 2018, Walsh told an interviewer: \\"I think it's unlikely that I'll play for Kerry again\\". The headline in the printed edition read: \\"From twin tower to supersub target man, Walsh is key to Kingdom dream\\". Peter Keane took over as Kerry manager in late 2018. He phoned Walsh. Walsh helped Kerry reach the 2019 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. A substitute against Dublin, the drawn game was the first time in a decade that he played in the decider. Almost as soon as he came on, Walsh set up a vital Kerry goal for Killian Spillane.

In the vicinity of the town line, Route 218 briefly becomes a four-lane road for about after its intersection with Route 185. Hall Boulevard continues north through southern Bloomfield following along Tumble Brook, then turns east at Cottage Grove Road, assuming the Cottage Grove name. Route 218 becomes a partially controlled-access divided four-lane highway for about four miles (6 km) as it runs east through southern Bloomfield. Along the way, it intersects Route 189 and Route 187. Just east of Route 187, Route 218 becomes undivided, but maintains 4 lanes, and soon reaches the Windsor.

Laugesen writes for The Washington Examiner, the National Catholic Register, Faith & Family magazine, is a former editor of Soldier of Fortune, Boulder Weekly, and was managing editor of the former \\"Consumers' Research\\" national magazine in Washington, D.C. Laugesen has produced the international Catholic prayer series, \\"Holy Baby!\\". Urban planning Laugesen, who considers himself a conservative libertarian, has criticized urban planners who advocate \\"affordable housing\\" while harming minorities and the poor with anti-growth policies. His work became the topic of a journalistic ethics debate in 2004, when he smashed historic windows from a Boulder, Colorado, home in protest of historic preservation orders by the Boulder City Council—an act that led media critic Michael Roberts to coin the phrase \\"commando journalism\\". Guns As assistant editor of Soldier of Fortune in the 1990s, Laugesen helped obtain guns and training for women in a Boulder neighborhood that was stalked by a serial rapist. He brought an obscure vice principal to the forefront by giving him Soldier of Fortune's annual Humanitarian Award for using a handgun to stop a school massacre in Pearl, Mississippi. Laugesen stirred controversy among Soldier of Fortune's conservative readership with a cover story that criticized modern police for exceeding their authority and violating the rights of citizens. Timothy McVeigh, four years after perpetrating the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing, was asked by reporters to \\"describe his motivations\\" for his lethal actions. McVeigh mailed a copy of the March 1999 Soldier of Fortune article along with a letter to Fox News reporter Rita Cosby. Catholic sex abuse scandal As the National Catholic Register's correspondent covering the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops when the Catholic sexual abuse scandal emerged, Laugesen is often cited for research that has put the problem in context by comparing abuse statistics of Catholic institutions with those of other religious and secular organizations. Drugs Though preferring to be seen as a social conservative, Laugesen has been critical of the war on drugs. His drug war research often appears on web sites hosted by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and other organizations devoted to drug legalization. Laugesen's research into the DARE program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) has led to articles that have been used in campaigns to get DARE out of public and private schools. Laugesen and The Gazette's editorial board were widely criticizedhttps://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/colorado_springs_gazette_marijuana.php in 2015 for producing the series \\"Clearing the Haze,\\" which blasted state regulations and regulators for problems with Colorado's recreational and medicinal marijuana industries. Religious controversies Laugesen often defends Israel and Judaism, but was accused of anti-semitism in a 2008 article in the Independent, an alternative newsweekly that intercepted an e-mail conversation between Laugesen and an official of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, an organization that fights against military efforts to establish religion. Other media reported on the controversy and the allegations were quickly refuted. A defender of religious liberty, Laugesen has become a frequent topic of criticism by atheist leader PZ Myers. Dozens of other well-known atheist activists have come out against Laugesen, including the atheist expert of About.com. Laugesen has stirred controversy in Colorado and the mostly-conservative Christian city of Colorado Springs by advocating for Mosques, inviting them to build in Colorado. Conversely, Laugesen routinely defended the former Denver Broncos rookie quarterback Tim Tebow against attacks from the secular media. Laugesen was featured on national television and radiohttp://video.foxnews.com/v/4439980941001/faith-under-fire- chick-fil-a-location-threatened/?intcmp=hpvid1#sp=show-clips to discuss the Denver City Council's 2015 opposition to Chick-fil-A in Denver International Airport, as a result of CEO Dan Cathy's statements and donations in support of traditional marriage and family. Video producer Laugesen and his wife, Dede, are co-producers of Holy Baby! and Holy Baby! 2, a popular set of multilingual prayer videos for Catholic children that have been referred to as the Catholic Baby Einstein. The videos are broadcast internationally on the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), and on New Evangelization Television (NET) in New York. Three cartoon characters from the videos—Baby Scholastica, Baby Bosco and his puppy Gregio—are sold internationally as plush toys in Catholic and non-Catholic Christian bookstores.

He was martyred by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2001 and recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 2007. Early life Gojdič (pronunciation Goydich) was born on July 17, 1888, at Ruske Peklany near Presov (Prjasev), the third child of the Byzantine Catholic priest Stefan Gojdic; his mother's name was Anna Gerberyova. He received the name of Peter in baptism. Gojdič attended elementary school at Cigelka, Bardejov, and Presov, finishing his primary studies at Presov in 1907. He began his study of theology at Presov and continued them a year later at the major seminary in Budapest. He and his brother Cornelius were ordained on August 27, 1911, after which Gojdič worked for a brief period as assistant parish priest with his father.

He was also entrusted with the spiritual care of the faithful in Sabinov as assistant parish priest. Gojdič was appointed to the Bishop's Chancery Office, where eventually he achieved the rank of Chancellor. A career as a diocesan administrator did not attract him, so he decided to become a Basilian monk. On July 20, 1922, Gojdič entered St. Nicholas Monastery on Chernecha Hora, near Mukachevo, where taking the habit on January 27, 1923, he took the name Pavel. Appointed Director of the Apostleship of Prayer, he became instrumental in spreading the practice of frequent confession and holy communion throughout the Eparchy of Mukachevo. He usually spent long hours, mostly at night, in the chapel before the tabernacle. In 1927 he was appointed titular Bishop of Harpasa and was consecrated on 25 March in the Roman Basilica of San Clemente by Bishop Dionisije Njaradi. After his episcopal ordination he visited the Basilica of St. Peter in Rome, where he prayed on the tomb of the Apostle. On March 29, 1927, together with Bishop Njaradi, he was received in a private audience by Pope Pius XI. The pope gave Gojdič a gold pectoral cross, saying: \\"This cross is only a symbol of all those heavy crosses that you will have to carry during your episcopal ministry.\\" Gojdič had been named Apostolic Administrator of the Eparchy of Presov on September 14, 1926. His first official act in this office was to address a pastoral letter on the occasion of the 1100th anniversary of the birth of St. Cyril, apostle of the Slavs. Gojdič was proud of his Slavic heritage and was very fond of his oriental rite.\\"Pavol Gojdic (1888–1960)\\", at the website of the Vatican Bishop In 1940 the Pope appointed him Bishop of Presov, and for the year 1939 Apostolic Administrator of Mukacheve. During the period before World War II, he decided to defend the Ruthenians and others against the onslaught of Slovak nationalism.Roy Palmer Domenico, Mark Y. Hanley, Michael J. Kopanic, Jr. Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pg 243 From the beginning of their persecution in Slovakia, Gojdič spoke up openly in favor of the Jewish population. On January 25, 1939, two days after the establishment of a special committee by the Slovak autonomist government charged with defining the \\"Program for the Solution of the Jewish Question,\\" the bishop wrote a letter addressed to all parishes in his Prešov diocese; in the letter, he predicted disastrous results caused by these discriminatory policies. After the Slovak parliament confirmed a special law permitting the expulsion of Jews from Slovakia, Gojdič wrote a protest against the cruel deportations which were being carried out by the clerical Hlinka Party.\\"Bishop Pavel Gojdic\\" at the Yad Vashem website On 31 March 1942, Gojdič suggested to Giuseppe Burzio that President Jozef Tiso ought to resign, or if he refused, be laicized for his complicity in the deportation of Jews. During the war the bishop helped refugees and prisoners, and rescued inmates of concentration camps. On October 26, 1942, Slovak security services informed the Ministry of the Interior of a high number of fictitious conversions taking place. The report pointed out several cases where only one member of a Jewish family converted to Christianity in order to protect all the other members. Out of 249 Jewish families, 533 Jews had converted to the Greek Catholic or Russian Orthodox faith in order to rescue some 1500 other members of their families, who had not converted; moreover, most of those who had converted continued to actively practice Judaism either in the open or undercover. According to the security service report, Gojdič had held a conversion ceremony in the town of Michalovce. After the end of hostilities, those who had been saved by Gojdič foresaw that his wartime actions would not be well received by the new Communist government and offered to help him emigrate to the West. However, Gojdič refused to leave his post as bishop. Foreseeing the Communist takeover, with the help of a new auxiliary, Bishop Hopko, he launched a campaign to reinforce the faith of his people by mobilizing every possible means: visits, missions, retreats, the press and the radio. Gojdič resisted any initiative to submit the Greek Catholics to Russian Orthodoxy, assisted by the Communist Party, while he knew he was risking persecution, arrest and maybe even death. Even though he was put under severe pressure to renounce the Catholic faith and break unity with the Pope, he refused every offer. Gradually he was isolated from the clergy and the faithful. Memorial to Bishop Gojdič at the Leopoldov cemetery On April 28, 1950, the Communist state outlawed the Greek Catholic Church and Gojdič was arrested and interned. Jewish witnesses wrote a letter in his defense to the then-Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia Antonín Zápotocký, but to no avail. In January 1951, in a trial set up against three 'high treason' bishops (Vojtaššák, Buzalka, and Gojdič) he was given a life sentence. Transferred from one prison to another, he remained faithful, praying and saying Divine Liturgy in secret, despite facing torture. Following an amnesty in 1953, given by Zapotocký, his life sentence was changed to 25 years detention. He was then 66 and his health continued to deteriorate, yet all further requests for amnesty were refused. At the prison of Ruzyň an official informed him that from there he could go straight to Prešov, on condition that he was willing to become patriarch of the Orthodox Church in Czechoslovakia. He rejected the offer as an infidelity to the Pope and the faithful, and remained in prison. He died of terminal cancer in the prison hospital of Leopoldov Prison in 1960, on his 72nd birthday. He was buried in an anonymous grave, n. 681, in the cemetery. Veneration In 1968, his remains were moved to Prešov, and since 1990 have been kept in a sarcophagus in the Greek-Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. On 4 November 2001, he was beatified by Pope John Paul II, who during his historic visit in Slovakia, while visiting Prešov, prayed at the tomb of this bishop-martyr in the chapel of the cathedral. Gojdič was legally rehabilitated on September 27, 1990. Subsequently, he was decorated posthumously with the Order of T. G.

Baron Francesco Bentivegna (4 March 1820 – 20 December 1856) was an Italian patriot, who led various revolts in Sicily against the Bourbon rulers between 1848 and 1856. Early life Bentivegna was born in Corleone, Sicily, to Giliberto de Cordova, Marquis of Giostra Florence and Teresa de Cordova, from the Bourbon-Orleans. His parents originally wanted him to become a priest as the Bentivegna family was very involved with the Roman Catholic Church and regularly donated large sums of money. This is dated back to St Benedict. Struggle against foreign occupation He initially fought against the Bourbons in Palermo in 1848. To honor his bravery, the provisional governor appointed Bentivegna to be the military governor of the Corleone district. He accepted the position but refused to be paid for his services. Within 16 months the Bourbon forces reoccupied Palermo. The Bourbon governor offered amnesty to the renegades if they would pledge fealty to the French rulers. Bentivegna refused to make the pledge. On 27 January 1850, he once again attempted a coup against the Bourbon government of Palermo. Barely escaping, he managed to live more than two years as a wanted fugitive, continuing to organize the Italian revolutionaries. He was finally arrested on 25 February 1853 in the Albergheria quarter of Palermo. He was released on 25 July 1856 before his lawyers could plead his case in court. After his release, Bentivegna deemed it was the right time for a full revolt of Italy from foreign domination. In 1856, with fellow revolutionary Salvatore Spinuzza, he attempted to create an uprising of the people. He organized squadre of peasants to attack Mezzojuso and Villafrati, while Spinuzza centered his activities in Cefalù. Giuseppe Mazzini promised to aid Bentivegna with his group, La Giovine Italia. Arrest and execution Before the 1856 uprising in Mezzojuso could occur, he was betrayed by Ignazio Milone, a Corleonese who had been promised a knighthood and an annual salary of 300 ducats. Bentivegna was arrested on 2 December 1856 while hiding in a house in the Punzonotto Contrada of Corleone. After a summary process the next day, he was sentenced to death by firing squad. The execution took place on 20 December 1856 at Mezzojuso. Bentivegna's death sentence was pronounced based on the charges for his arrest in 1853. But since he was released without having been given a trial at that time, his capital punishment has historically been considered illegal. Eyewitnesses claimed Bentivegna requested his estate be given to his mother, but this was prohibited by law since surviving males of the line inherited automatically. Fate of corpse Following his execution by firing squad, Bentivegna's corpse was thrown into an ossuary, but was quickly, and secretly, removed and hidden. On 23 June 1860, after Sicily had been liberated by Giuseppe Garibaldi, Bentivegna's body was transported to Corleone. One year later, wrapped in the Italian tricolor flag, he was entombed in the chapel of San Biagio (St. Blaise) in Cefalù, where a monument was erected in his honour.

The frame of the chair is generally painted black. The sling was originally leather, Alt URL but can also be made from canvas or other materials. The design is popular for portable recreational seating.  History  The Butterfly chair was designed in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1938 by the architects Antonio Bonet, Juan Kurchan and , who were working with Le Corbusier's studio, and who formed the architectural collective in Buenos Aires. The chair was developed for an apartment building they designed in Buenos Aires. On March 6, 1940, a picture of the chair appeared in the US publication Retailing Daily, where it was described as a \\"newly invented Argentine easy-chair . . . for siesta sitting\\". On July 24, 1940, the chair as awarded 2nd prize by the National Cultural Commission at the 3rd Salón de Artistas Decoradores exhibition in Argentina. Both the exhibition and the picture in Retailing Daily attracted the attention of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. At the request of the director of MoMA's Industrial Design Department, Edgar Kaufmann Jr., Hardoy sent 3 chairs to New York. One went to Fallingwater, Edgar Kaufmann Jr.'s home in Pennsylvania (designed by Frank Lloyd Wright), another went to MoMA, while the third probably went to Clifford Pascoe of Artek-Pascoe, Inc., New York. The chair gets the name of BKF chair from the initials of its creators \\"Bonet-Kurchan- Ferrari\\". It is also known as the Hardoy chair because an official letter from the firm attributed primary authorship of the design to Ferrari-Hardoy.  Origins  The BKF chair is a modern update of the Paragon chair (more recently known as the Tripolina chair), which was designed by Joseph Beverley Fenby and has been used as campaign furniture and camping furniture since the 1880s.  Production  The chair was originally made in Argentina. However, Edgar Kaufmann Jr. accurately predicted that it would become extremely popular in the US, calling it one of the \\"best efforts of modern chair design\\". In the early 1940s, it was produced in the US by Artek-Pascoe, Inc., New York). Production was slow, due to wartime shortage of metal. After the war, the US production rights were acquired by Hans Knoll, who had recognized its commercial potential in 1947 and added it to the Knoll line. The chair’s commercial success led to a surge in unauthorized replicas. After a losing a legal case for design-infringement, Knoll ceased production in 1951. Since then, the butterfly chair continues to be produced by many manufacturers from many countries.

He has been the Representative of Capiz's 2nd district since 2013, and previously from 2001 to 2010. He was the House Majority Leader from January to June 2019. Political career Castro was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2001, representing the 2nd district of Capiz. He was re-elected in 2004 and 2007, thus reaching the limit of three consecutive terms in 2010. During his first two terms in the House, Castro was a member of the Liberal Party and an ally of fellow Capiznon Mar Roxas (who at that time was trade secretary and later a senator). In the 2007 elections, he ran under Lakas–CMD, the party supporting then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He also served as the chairman of the party's Capiz chapter. In 2009, Castro also chaired the Capiz-based local party Ugyon Kita Capiz (UKC). With UKC, his wife Jane Tan-Castro was elected to the position he vacated. Jane served as the 2nd district's representative from 2010 to 2013. The Castros also allied themselves with former agriculture undersecretary Jocelyn Bolante, who was facing allegations of plunder. Bolante was UKC's vice-chairman who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010. Castro successfully returned to the House in 2013. Running under the National Unity Party (NUP; formed by disgruntled Lakas members), he defeated Maria Andaya of the Liberal Party. He then became chair of the House Committee on Suffrage and Electoral Reforms in the 16th Congress. In November 2013, Castro's committee unanimously approved House Bill 3587 or the Anti-Political Dynasty Act of 2013, which aims to prohibiting relatives up to the second degree of consanguinity to hold or run for public offices in successive, simultaneous, or overlapping terms. It was the first time since 1988 that an anti-political dynasty bill passed the committee level.

Unlike Ellehammer's semi-biplane of the previous year, this (otherwise unnamed) triplane was capable of making free, untethered flights. The aircraft featured three sets of triangular wings attached to an open tubular framework. The upper set was one continuous-span, but the lower sets were split and attached either side of the frame. A horizontal stabiliser was fitted aft of the frame. There were no conventional vertical stabilizers, however the covered tailwheel provided a very small amount of surface area for stability. On 14 January 1908 Ellehammer achieved a flight in this machine of 175 m (574 ft) and on 13 February, one of 300 m (1,000 ft). Around this time, he also started making curved flights. In June, Ellehammer demonstrated the triplane in Kiel, where he was able to collect a M 5,000 prize from Prince Henry of Prussia for making a powered flight in Germany.

The RNS device is implanted while connected to leads that are placed in up to two areas where seizures begin. The device monitors brain activity in order to detect abnormal patterns, and in response delivers electrical pulses in an attempt to prevent seizures. The RNS System was approved by the US FDA in 2013 to treat adults with partial onset seizures that are not controlled by medications. As of March 2017 over 1,000 patients have been implanted with the RNS System. Method The RNS System continuously monitors brain activity at the implant site, unperceived by the patient. The device is programmed by physicians to detect electrical patterns that can lead to seizures., which are different for every individual. The system is designed to detect brain patterns which lead to seizures, then disrupt those patterns, preventing seizures. The system also provides information to a patient's doctor about seizure frequency and electrocoricographic activity. The RNS System is surgically implanted in the skull by a trained neurosurgeon and typically involves an overnight stay in the hospital. The therapy is reversible; the procedure does not involve removing any brain tissue. Research The RNS System was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical study. The study included adults who have medically refractory, partial onset seizures with up to two localized seizure foci, and who had failed at least two medications. In total, 191 patients were randomized 1:1 to either treatment with the RNS System or sham stimulation. After the four month blinded period, stimulation was turned on for all patients. Treatment with the RNS System resulted in statistically significant seizure reductions compared to the sham group. By the end of the blinded period, patients in the Treatment group had a 41.5% reduction in disabling seizures compared to 9.4% in the Sham group (p=0.008). The safety profile of the RNS System compared favorably to deep brain stimulation as well as implantation of intracranial electrodes and epilepsy surgery \\"Responsive cortical stimulation for the treatment of medically intractable partial epilepsy\\". Morrell MJ; RNS System in Epilepsy. Neurology. 2011 Sep 27;77(13):1295-304. Patients treated with the RNS System experienced seizure reductions in the first year that continued to improve over time. At seven years, patients achieved a 72% median reduction in seizures (Bergey, 2015). Patients treated with the RNS System reported statistically significant improvements in mood and overall quality of life, including physical health, mental health, cognitive effects, and seizure worry (Meador, 2015). Patients treated with the RNS System showed statistically significant improvements in naming and verbal memory. This is meaningful because individuals with epilepsy are at risk for cognitive disability and decline which has also been associated with other epilepsy treatments. For example, many antiepileptic drugs have adverse cognitive effects, patients treated with deep brain stimulation have reported cognitive decline, and epilepsy surgery carries risks for decline in cognitive areas specifically related to those regions of the brain that are resected (Loring, 2015). The therapy is claimed to be less invasive than other therapies such as vagus nerve stimulation, which can have chronic stimulation-related side effects such as voice alterations, coughing, throat discomfort, and shortness of breath.

He was a member of the Docibilan dynasty which ruled the Duchy of Gaeta from 867 to 1032. During his long episcopate he achieved the economic security of his see in the face of labour difficulties, annexed the diocese of Traetto to his own in or soon after 999, and witnessed the decline and replacement of his family in Gaeta. Bernard was a younger son of Duke Marinus II. His appointment as bishop in 997 may have been intended to give the ruling dynasty control of the church in their city, where conflicts with prior bishops had not been uncommon, or to contain the ambitions of a younger son; or both.Skinner 1995, p. 90. His election as bishop was earlier than the month of May, during which he witnessed a charter by which the diocese leased some of its property to private persons, signing as a \\"cleric ... I should attain the rank of bishop\\" (clericus… quia debeo ad ordinem episcopatus adtingere).Petrucci 1967. In September he consecrated a church in Gaeta before ceding it to three Roman churchmen. Towards the end of 998 he participated in a synod in Rome under Pope Gregory V. After the death of Andreas, bishop of Traetto, who last appears in documents in 999, he united the Traettan diocese to his own.Skinner 1995, p. 162. The first tests of Bernard's leadership were a couple of disputes in 999. He disputed the rights to Spinio (Spigno Vecchia) with his nephew, Count Daufer II of Traetto, but they came to an agreement and divided the place later that year.Skinner 1995, p. 91. Then two famuli, John and Anatolius, sons of Passari Caprucce and his wife Benefacta, claimed they were free men while Bernard claimed they were slaves belonging the church of Gaeta.Skinner 1995, p. 254–55. Bernard called in the assistance of the imperial missus of the region, Notticher, who travelled to Gaeta, Traetto, and Castro Argento to settle other labour disputes which had arisen and were costing the diocese heavily. Bernard alludes to working refusing to work in his letter to Notticher. When the missus demanded that John and Anatolius submit to trial by combat (unheard of in Gaeta, where Byzantine law was the rule), they instead swore an oath that their mother had been a freewoman and paid a pound of gold, which Notticher accepted. As early as 1002 Bernard had entered into friendly relations with his sister-in-law Emilia. In that year he repaid her in land for the services she had done the church. When, in 1012, she became regent for her son, John V, Bernard supported her against her opponents, Leo I and Leo II, and by 1025 she was victorious, largely due to Bernard. In 1014 Bernard represented John during arguments held between the counts of Traetto and the Abbey of Montecassino, a sign of his importance during the regency of Emilia, but also of the declining importance of the dukes of Gaeta (nominally) in their own duchy.Skinner 1995, p. 151. In 1008, Bernard built the church of Saint John the Baptist in Gaeta with financial help from some of the leading families of the city.Skinner 1995, p. 221. Of the last three decades of his episcopate, little is recorded. The last datable record is from 1032, the same year Prince Pandulf IV of Capua conquered the city. He continued on as bishop under successive Lombard and Norman governments, but how long is unknown. One dubious document from May 1047 refers to him as bishop, but he was succeeded, thanks to the remaining supporters of his family, by his nephew Leo, son of Leo II, at least by July 1049.Skinner 1995, p. 159.

It is the oldest dwelling in Wake County and contains collections of 18th century artifacts and period furnishings. The museum grounds include a detached middle class home built circa 1790, formal city garden, and period herb garden. The house is named after Joel Lane, the \\"Father of Raleigh\\" and \\"Father of Wake County.\\" In the late 1760s, Lane settled at Wake Cross Roads located in colonial Johnston County. Lane and his house played a key role in North Carolina's transition from colony to state and in the establishment of Raleigh as the state capital. Joel Lane's plantation manor stood on a small hill, overlooking the future site of Raleigh. Lane owned thousands of acres, which enabled him to be influential in politics. Lane was a member of the colonial General Assembly, and in 1770 successfully lobbied to create Wake County, at the time a sparsely settled wilderness. The county was named \\"Wake\\" in honor of Margaret Wake, wife of colonial Governor William Tryon. In 1771, Wake County's first county court is believed to have convened at his home. Lane was appointed a member of the court, a position he held until his death. During the Revolutionary War, Wake Cross Roads was the site of important government meetings, both formal and informal. In 1776, Lane hosted the colony Council of Safety; the following year, he obtained a license for a small inn. From May to June 1781, Lane's property was the setting for a session of the state General Assembly. Lane served in the state Senate in 11 of the 14 sessions from 1782 to 1794. He was also a delegate to the 1789 convention in Halifax that ratified the United States Constitution. Lane was directly involved in the decision to locate the permanent capital of the state in Wake County. In 1792, the legislature authorized the purchase of of his land upon which to establish the city of \\"Raleigh\\" as the new center of state government. The community's western boundary was drawn just east of Lane's house, and a street of the city was named in his honor. After Lane's death in 1795, Lane's house served several owners before being purchased by businessman William Boylan in 1818. The house, along with Montfort Hall, remained in the Boylan family until 1909. During this time, the city of Raleigh absorbed the house into its expanding boundaries. Lane's former plantation became the site of new streets, homes and businesses. In 1911, the house was moved a short distance. In 1927, Lane's house was purchased by the National Society of Colonial Dames of America in the State of North Carolina to ensure its preservation. The organization continues to operate this Raleigh Historic Landmark as a house museum.

Based on experiments with models, Jacob Ellehammer constructed a full-size machine equipped with two contra-rotating discs, each of which was fitted with six vanes around its circumference. The pitch of these vanes could be varied in operation by the pilot, an early example of cyclic control. The same engine that drove the rotors also powered a propeller mounted tractor-wise to the aircraft's frame. 1935 photo of Ellehammer's disc-rotor compound helicopter model After a number of indoor tests, the aircraft was demonstrated outdoors and made a number of free take-offs. One of these trials was witnessed by Prince Axel of Denmark. Experiments with the helicopter continued until September 1916, when it tipped over during take-off, destroying its rotors. A famous photo shows it hovering in 1914, though there is no evidence that it was successful in achieving translational flight. Ellehammer later studied a disc-rotor configuration - a compound helicopter with coaxial blades that extended from the hub for hover, and retracted for high speed vertical flight. Although a wind tunnel model was constructed, there's no evidence that anything more was studied.

Ale spends rest of the day selling chocolate and candy to passengers on trains with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata). After they finish selling the candy, Carlos informs Ale that Rob (Rob Sowulski), the owner of an auto repair shop in Willets Point, is looking for new workers. Ale soon begins working at the repair shop, which Rob has also allowed him to live in. He is soon joined by his sister Isamar (\\"Izzy\\", played by Isamar Gonzales) who he finds work for in a food van that sells food to workers on the street. Ale later finds a van being sold by Carlos' uncle that he believes he can fix up and turn into his and Izzy's own food van business. The two begin saving their money to buy the $4,500 van. One night, Ale and Carlos go to the nearby truck stop to see the prostitutes working. There they discover that Isamar is working as a prostitute. Ale is disheartened by the fact but does not confront Isamar about it. The two continue working and saving their money up for the van. Ale makes additional money by selling unlicensed DVDs, selling hubcaps he steals from cars parked at the nearby stadium, and working for another auto shop owner, Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi) by stripping down a stolen car. One day, after hearing his sister talk on the phone to what he believes is a prostitution customer or a boyfriend, he steals some money from his sister and, together with the money they have saved, buys the van from Carlos' uncle. When he gets Ahmad to look into the repair of the van, however, he is informed that the interior of the van is unfit to serve food off and would cost around $10,000 to fix up. Angry that Carlos' uncle ripped him off, Ale starts a fight with Carlos before getting pulled off. With his dreams crushed, Ale goes to the stadium and snatches a woman's handbag and gets a phone he fails to sell. Isamar questions him about the phone. He yells at her and demands that she \\"should be working,\\" meaning she should be selling herself as a prostitute to make money for them. Isamar realizes her brother knows about her secret. Ale decides to get the van stripped for parts and loses money. Ale has nothing left. His dreams and his life have been \\"chopped up\\" into parts. He goes to the truck stop to look for Isamar. There, he begins to attack the man receiving a blowjob from his sister, before the two of them run back to the auto shop. When they get there, Isamar hides in the toilet and doesn't speak to Ale. The film ends the next day with Ale feeding seeds to the area's pigeons to cheer her up. The pigeons' sudden arrival make Isamar smile with her brother. She then scares them away and they go flying up into the sky.

Harrison. Nicknamed Fish Church, for its unusual shape, it is a unique example of modernist architecture, and an architectural landmark. Its Maguire Memorial Tower holds a 56-bell carillon. History and architecture The original First Presbyterian Church of Stamford was a wooden structure located at 90 Broad Street from 1854 to 1882 when it burned down. It was replaced with a stone edifice, enlarged in 1920, which was used until 1958. In 1954, the congregation voted to relocate to its present location at 1101 Bedford Street. Designed by Wallace K. Harrison, the new sanctuary was dedicated in March 1958. Its shape has been likened to that of a fish- a symbol used in early Christianity. The fish shape is apparent both in the profile and in the floor plan of the structure. Enhancing the unique shape of the church are the enormous stained glass windows in the sanctuary, which contain more than 20,000 pieces of faceted glass. These windows depict the story of the Crucifixion (on the right side), and the Resurrection (on the left). A cross faced with wood from the Canterbury Cathedral in England, dominates the Chancel. The church originally had an electronic organ, now replaced with a large Visser-Rowland pipe organ.alt= The stone wall along Bedford Street contains a series of tablets which recognize significant events, institutions, and individuals in the history of Stamford, particularly those with a religious impact, from 1641 to 1975. The Memorial Walk leading from Fellowship Hall (a multi-purpose space which includes a kitchen and stage) to the main entrance of the Sanctuary, has more than 100 stones, each representing an important figure in the Judeo/Christian tradition from the days of Abraham to the present. The corridor outside the chapel contains a collection of over 100 stones from sites of historical Christian significance, gathered during the world travels of former pastor Dr. George Stewart. The stone wall bears the inscription: \\"from far places where other believers turned not their back.\\" The church is home to a 56-bell carillon, now housed in the Maguire Memorial Tower.

Kaye (June 27, 1938 – January 31, 1975) was the co-founder of Tactical Studies Rules (TSR), the game publishing company most famous for their Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) role-playing game. He and TSR co-founder Gary Gygax had been friends since childhood, sharing an interest in miniature war games. In 1972, Kaye created Murlynd, one of the first D&D; characters, and play-tested him in Gygax's Castle Greyhawk campaign. Kaye and Gygax were convinced that D&D; and similar games were an excellent business opportunity, and together they founded Tactical Studies Rules in 1973. However, only two years later, just as sales of D&D; started to rise, Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack at age 36. Early life and early gaming Don Kaye was born on June 27, 1938. He grew up in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where at age 8, he became friends with Gygax, who had moved there from Chicago, Illinois. The two young boys also often played with tomboy Mary Jo Powell, but lost touch with her when she moved away. At age 15, Kaye and Gygax began playing miniature war games, designing their own miniatures rules for their large collection of 54 mm and 70 mm toy soldiers, using \\"ladyfinger firecrackers\\" to simulate explosions. When they were 19, Mary Jo Powell, now a young woman, returned to Lake Geneva and the two friends were smitten with her. Although they both courted her, it was Gygax who ultimately persuaded Mary Jo to marry him. This caused a rift in their friendship, and Kaye refused to attend Gygax's wedding. They eventually reconciled after the wedding. In 1965, Kaye, Gygax, Mike Reese, and Leon Tucker created a military miniatures society, Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA). Its first headquarters were in Gygax's basement, and they later held meetings in Kaye's garage. \\\\- excerpt notes from Paul Stromberg, with Gary Gygax and Rob Kuntz debating the location and organization of LGTSA meetings. Formation of TSR In the fall of 1972, Dave Arneson, a wargamer from nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul, demonstrated a new type of role-playing game to the LGTSA. Gygax then created a similar game set in the imaginary Castle Greyhawk, and invited his children, Ernie and Elise, \\"to create characters and adventure\\".Gygax: \\"It was in the late fall of 1972 when I completed a map of some castle ruins, noted ways down to the dungeon level (singular), and invited my 11-year-old son Ernie and nine-year-old daughter Elise to create characters and adventure. This they did, and around 9 pm ... they had to come back from such imaginary derring-do, put their index card character sheets aside, and get ready for bed. They had had a marvelous time and wanted to keep playing.\\" The next evening, Kaye joined the game along with Gygax's friends Rob Kuntz and Terry Kuntz. Kaye created the character Murlynd, Rob Kuntz created Robilar and Terry Kuntz created Terik.Gygax: \\"In a couple of days time Don Kaye (Murlynd), Rob (Robilar, Otto) and Terry (Terik) Kuntz joined the gang.\\" Kaye observed with interest as a very enthusiastic group played the prototype Dungeons & Dragons game at Gen Con VI (1973), and suggested to Gygax that they form a company to publish the game themselves. Sensing the potential popularity of the game, in October 1973 the two men each invested in the venture — Kaye borrowed his share on his life insurance policy — in order to finance the start-up of TSR, which was initially run out of Kaye's dining room. Their investment of $2000 was not enough to print their new role-playing game, so they instead published Cavaliers and Roundheads, a miniatures game based on the English Civil War, \\\\- \\"After being turned down by all major game manufacturers of the time, Gary Gygax and Don Kaye formed a partnership, which operated out of Kaye's dining room in Lake Geneva. It was named Tactical Studies Rules after their local wargaming club called Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association. Kaye covered the $1,000 they needed to publish Cavaliers and Roundheads, a miniature game of the English Civil War.\\" and planned to use its revenue to print and publish D&D.; But sales were poor, and they still did not have enough capital to publish Dungeons & Dragons. While developing D&D;, Gygax had sent copies of his preliminary rules to other wargaming friends for playtesting. Now worried that someone who had playtested the new type of game would bring a similar product to the market first, the two accepted an offer in December 1973 by playing acquaintance Brian Blume to invest $2000 in TSR to become an equal one-third partner. (Gygax accepted Blume's offer right away. Kaye was less enthusiastic, and after a week to consider the offer, he questioned Blume closely before acquiescing.) Blume's investment finally brought the financing that enabled them to publish D&D.; In January 1974, they printed a thousand copies of the game and hand-assembled them in the basement of Gygax's house. Warehousing and shipping was done from Kaye's home. The first printing sold out before the end of 1974, and sales of a second printing began to increase exponentially. In late 1974, Kaye helped develop some of the rules for a new Western-genre game to be called Boot Hill.Kuntz: \\"Don was a great fan of the Western and an avid supporter of the Boot Hill rules.\\" Death and legacy Although only 36 years old at the start of 1975, Kaye needed heart surgery, a fact that he did not disclose to his partners. Gygax and Blume were therefore unprepared when Kaye suffered a heart attack before the scheduled date for surgery and died on January 31, 1975. Kaye had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one- third share of the company, so his share of TSR passed to his wife, who was not interested in having any part of TSR. Gygax stated \\"After Don died [Kaye's wife] dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner.\\" Neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to formally buy the share owned by Kaye's wife, but Blume persuaded Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy it. The company was re-formed as TSR Hobbies, Inc, with the Blume family owning controlling interest. In 1975, Gygax and Blume published Boot Hill in memory of Kaye. Gygax highlighted Kaye's character Murlynd in the March 1983 issue of Dragon magazine. Gygax paid further tribute to Kaye when he used Murlynd's name for two spells (Murlynd's Ogre, Murlynd's Void) and an item (Murlynd's Spoon) in Unearthed Arcana.Gygax, Gary.

Emergence The nymphs live three to four years in the water before emergence. Immediately prior to emerging, the nymphs congregate near the shoreline in shallow water on partially exposed rocks. About one month before emergence pteronarcys californica start migrating from the center of the river to the shoreline making them more susceptible to predation. To emerge, the nymphs crawl from the water to rocks or the shore, and split the nymphal exoskeleton. The adults emerge from the exuviae ready to mate. The emergence is also followed closely by fly-fishermen, and is one of the highlights of the spring fishing season.

During his playing days he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Roarke was born in West Warwick, Rhode Island, where he graduated from high school in 1948. He earned a B.Sc. degree in history at Boston College, and served as captain of the Eagles' football and baseball teams. He won the Scanlan Award in 1951 for outstanding ability in scholarship, leadership, and athletic ability. Minor- league apprenticeship Like his college teammate, future MLB utilityman and manager Joe Morgan, Roarke signed with the local National League club, the Boston Braves, in 1952. After a brief stint with the Braves' Evansville farm club in the Class B Three-I League, Roarke entered the military, effectively delaying his professional debut until 1954. Known as a good handler of pitchers and an excellent defensive catcher, Roarke struggled as a hitter, eclipsing a .250 batting average only three times in his seven-year minor league career. The Braves, who had moved to Milwaukee just before the 1953 season, employed one of the best and most durable catchers of the 1950s, eleven-time National League All-Star Del Crandall, and were also one of the era's deepest and strongest Major League clubs. They never called Roarke up from Triple-A. Tigers' second-string catcher After the 1959 season, Roarke was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a deal that included Charley Lau. He toiled one further season, 1960, in the minors (with the Denver Bears of the American Association) before finally making his Major League debut with the Tigers at age 30 on April 19, 1961. He spent four seasons (1961–64) as Detroit's second-string receiver, working behind Dick Brown, Gus Triandos and Bill Freehan. In 194 total games, Roarke batted .230 with six home runs and 44 runs batted in. Bullpen and pitching coach He retired as an active player on October 9, 1964, to become a bullpen coach with the Tigers (1965–66) and California Angels (1967–69). Roarke then transitioned from bullpen coach to pitching coach—one of the handful of former catchers who excelled at being a pitching coach. He returned to the Tigers in 1970 as the replacement for high- profile mound tutor Johnny Sain for one season. Then, after a seven-year stint (1971–77) as a minor league manager and roving minor league pitching instructor, Roarke served as a pitching coach for the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals (where he worked on two NL pennant winners— and —under Whitey Herzog), San Diego Padres and Boston Red Sox, retiring after the strike- shortened 1994 season. He also spent three seasons in his native Rhode Island as pitching coach of the 1981–83 Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League, working with his old college classmate, Morgan, during his first two years with Pawtucket.

Life Hodgson was born in Potsdam, Prussia; a daughter of John and Frederica Lohman. She married the well connected Studholme George Hodgson in London on 18 February 1871 and the couple immediately migrated to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on the ship Melmerby on 24 June 1871.L.M.Robinson (2009) Madame Brussels: This Moral Pandemonium. p. 9\\\\. Arcade Publications, Carlton, Australia. In November 1872, Studholme joined the Victoria Police and was placed in country Mansfield, leaving his 25-year-old wife alone in Melbourne. By the end of 1874, Caroline, using the name 'Madame Brussels', was running a number of brothels, an occupation she continued successfully until 1907. When her husband became ill with tuberculosis in late 1892, Hodgson arranged for him to be nursed in at \\"Gnarwin\\", a property she owned on Beaconsfield Parade, St Kilda. He died in 1893. Memorial notices she placed as 'his loving wife Caroline Hodgson' made mention that he was 'brother-in-law of the baronet Sir Francis Wood, the brother of Sir Evelyn Wood'. In 1895, Hodgson married German engineer Jacob Pohl, who was at least 15 years her junior. However, Pohl suddenly disappeared to South Africa while they were on a trip to visit relatives in Germany in 1896. There was a reconciliation in 1898,L.M.Robinson (2009) p. 104 but a divorce was granted in February 1907 'on the grounds of desertion'. In court 'she appeared as a most benevolent looking old lady, and quite secured the sympathy of the court by her demeanor and recital of the story of her wrongs'. Hodgson died the following year at her Lonsdale Street home suffering from diabetes and chronic pancreatitis. She was buried at St Kilda Cemetery beside her first husband. She was survived by an adopted daughter, IreneBentley, Philip.

Career as a brothel keeper The Oddfellows Hotel, built in 1853, on the corner of Little Lonsdale Street and \\"Madam Brussels Lane\\" (formerly Little Leichardt Street) The reason for Hodgson's decision to turn to brothel keeping in 1874 is unknown, but historian Leanne Robinson suggests women had relatively few options open to them as a means to survive the economic uncertainty of life alone in the colony. Domestic service was poorly paid, as were the few occupations open to women – such as dressmaking and teaching. Hodgson's establishment of brothels in the Little Lon district, suggests she received financial backing from \\"friends in high places\\", a charge also made by Melbourne's Truth newspaper during their long campaign against her.L. M. Robinson. (2009) p. 26 Justin McCarthy also suggests the elite sex industry offered an attractive financial and social independence for women.Justin McCarthy (1989) The Commonwealth Block, Melbourne; Archaeological Investigation Report. Volume 1; Historical and Archaeological Report. p. 57\\\\. Australian Construction Services prepared for The Department of Administrative Services and Telecom Australia Hodgson's principal establishment, which was also her home, was located at 32-34 Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, not far from Parliament House. The building was extravagantly furnished and catered to Victoria's commercial, political and judicial ruling class, acting much as a gentlemen's club. Madame Brussels was 'used as a political football in 1906' and, the following year, was forced to close her businesses after the introduction of the Police Offences Act and increased efforts by the government to curtail prostitution. Campaign against her and end of career In the late 19th century Hodgson became the target of increasing vilification from newspapers and public figures.\\"A Graziers Carouse\\" The Advertiser (7 April 1907)] for example In his 1891 pamphlet The War between Heaven and Hell, religious crusader Henry Varley singled out Madame Brussels for particular scorn, describing her as an \\"accursed procuress\\", who was protected by the city's magistrates. In one famous passage, he claimed she had toured the streets of Melbourne \\"in charge of a beautiful young girl under twenty, with a white feather in her hat, telling by advertisement (the white feather) that maiden virtue was to be had for a price in her gilded den\\"Varley quoted in Graeme Davidson, David Dunstan & Chris McConville (Eds) (1985) The Outcasts of Melbourne. p. 50\\\\. Allen & Unwin, Australia. Madame Brussels is also associated with the disappearance of the Victorian Parliamentary mace in 1892. Rumours suggest politicians took the valuable object to one of her brothels 'where Members used it for \\"unparliamentary activities\\"'. Another theory has the mace disappearing at a brothel owned by her 'chief rival' Annie Wilson. John Norton's Truth newspaper also regularly attacked her, reporting in detail any of her court appearances. For example, in March 1906, the paper ran the headline \\"Madame Brussels' Notorious Bawdy House: Her Junketing Jezebels\\", above drawings of her \\"flash\\" girls. A wealthy grazier had called the police after his watch and sovereign purse were stolen in the brothel.Truth, 10 March 1906 Later that year, in a major exposé, the paper detailed Sir Samuel Gillott's many years of financial dealings with Hodgson. As Leanne Robinson notes, although Gillott \\"freely acknowledged his role as Caroline's mortgagee, he claimed ignorance as to the nature of [her] business – despite the fact that, as a parliamentarian, he'd been instrumental in framing legislation against gambling and licensing and had chaired public meetings on the suppression of vice.\\"L. M. Robinson (2009) pp. 96–97 Within a week, Gillott had resigned and soon after returned to England, and Hodgson had lost a significant ally. In April 1907, after appearing in court charged under new laws with \\"owing and operating a disorderly house\\", the ailing Caroline Hodgson closed her brothels in Lonsdale Street. With failing eyesight, diabetes and chronic pancreatitis, she continued to live at her Lonsdale Street property until her death in July 1908. Legacy Hodgson's former brothels at numbers 6-8 and 32-36 Lonsdale Street were demolished to make way for factories sometime before 1914. These factories were, in turn, demolished to make way for the Commonwealth building in the 1990s. Major archaeological investigations were conducted in the \\"Little Lon\\" block in 1988-9 and 2003, but they did not include the site of Hodgson's former properties. The studies did, however, establish prostitution as one of the key activities of this area in the late nineteenth century. All of the artefacts recovered during these digs are held by the Melbourne Museum. Several buildings still remain that were contemporary with Madam Brussel's era. These include the former Black Eagle Hotel (built 1854) at number 42-44 Lonsdale Street and the worker's cottage at Number 17 Casselden Place (built 1877). Caroline Hodgson's former seaside property in St. Kilda still stands. A city lanewayhttp://madamebrusselslane.com.au/home/story/ has been named after her, and a Melbourne bar also bears her name.
