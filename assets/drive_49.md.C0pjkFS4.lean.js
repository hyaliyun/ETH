In 2018 the quality of Givova sportswear jerseys made world wide attention in a story on involving the intersection of global sportswear brands, World cup teams, and international sanctions against Iran. On 14 June 2018, the New York Times reported that sanctions against Iran blocked the 2018 Iranian World Cup football team from using quality sportswear brands and limited the Iranian team to use other sportswear that were exempt from sanctions, such as Givova. In Belgium, the relatively new brand gained national attention when they announced their sponsorship of the Brussels-based football club FC ITT Gecko, renowned for their attractive brand of attacking football. FC ITT Gecko president Mr. Joeri Wei held a three-hour long press conference to celebrate the partnership with Givova, a sports moment that dominated the Belgian sports media for weeks. In 2017, after FC ITT Gecko had secured promotion to the highest division, the club announced that they were looking forward to a long-lasting and successful collaboration with Givova at the very highest level of Belgian football.

He represented the Singida North constituency in the National Assembly since 2000. He is currently a member of CHADEMA, an opposition party in Tanzania. Early life and career He pursued his undergraduate studies at Wartburg College in the United States, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration in 1997. Before that, he obtained an associate degree in Business Administration from Waldorf College in the United States. Nyalandu pursued secondary and primary Education in Tanzania. He went to Kibaha Boys' Secondary School and he went to Illboru Secondary School. In all these levels he obtained Division One (First Class) in the National Examination. Nyalandu pursued his primary education at Pohama Primary School in his home village in Singida. Prior to joining party politics, Nyalandu worked as an international affairs and development advisor for the Equal Opportunity Trust Fund, Tanzania from 1999‚Äì2000. This fund was established and run by Anna Mkapa, the wife of the former President of the United Republic of Tanzania. Before that, Nyalandu served as Operations Banker at Northwest Bank in Minneapolis, USA from 1998‚Äì1999. Non-Political Leadership and Governance Experience In April 2015, Nyalandu was appointed as Vice Chair of the New International Executive Board of Directors of Africa Travel Association (ATA)- a New York-based trade association promoting travel and tourism to Africa and strengthening intra-Africa partnerships. Nyalandu has previously served in a number of Organizations‚Äô Boards including chairing the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees of Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) from 2007 to 2010. Nyalandu was also a student leader, known for his role as the National President of Tanzania Christian Students Fellowship (TCSF), commonly known as UKWATA in Tanzania, from 1991 to 1993. Political career Nyalandu was first elected Member of Parliament for Singida North in November 2000. He was re-elected two times in 2005 and 2010. In representing citizens of Singida Rural, one of economically challenged Constituencies in Tanzania, Nyalandu's focus was based on systematic result-based rural development initiatives including development of water project for clean water accessibilities, building of secondary school laboratories to encourage science learning, and bringing faith leaders (Christians and Muslims together) in development work as well as in keeping the community together. As a former Member of Parliament, Nyalandu served as a member in a number of Parliamentary Committees including Foreign Affairs Committee and Public Accounts Committee for the period of 5 years each. Nyalandu also served as the Chair of the Tanzanian-Turkish Parliamentary Friendship Group, and the Tanzanian Young Parliamentary Association. =Minister= In his capacity as a Minister, Nyalandu had to work with both local and international partners in the fight against elephant poaching. As the world's leading country with over 130,000 tons of ivory stockpile, Tanzania has a key role to play in the fight against global cartel of ivory trade. In this respect, Nyalandu invited the United Kingdom government to join his Ministry in creating a transparent ivory stockpiles monitoring. This move counters unaccounted disappearance of ivory stockpiles. In May 2014, Nyalandu convened a conference that brought together international development partners including the UK, USA, EU, UAE, EAC, World Bank, UNDP, GEF, ADB, EABD, and other countries where ivory is sold to such as Japan, China, and Vietnam. The conference was an implementation action following the February 2014 Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London hosted by the UK Government. As Minister of Natural Resources & Tourism, Nyalandu took major initiatives through global forums to bring new hotel and infrastructure investment to Tanzania. He succeeded in winning the bid for Tanzania to host for the first time, the annual Africa Hotel Investment Forum scheduled for 2015. Under his watch, Nyalandu pioneered the establishment of the Tanzania Wildlife Authority, an independent government agency charged with protection and advancing wildlife conservation in protected areas outside national parks. In the ministerial positions he has held (both in Natural Resource and Tourism Ministry and in Industry and Trade), Nyalandu set a record of making bold and unprecedented decisions with immediate actions. Such bold decisions include: * Cancelling of license and revoking of all hunting permits to a company that was accused of gross misconduct in hunting practices in July 2014. * As Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade, he advocated for transparency and fairness in international labor migration by requiring all illegal immigrants to leave the country. =2015 Presidential campaign= On 28 December 2014, he announced his intention to run for the presidency in the 2015 election. Personal life He is married to Faraja Nyalandu (n√©e Kotta), the winner of Miss Tanzania in 2004. They have two children Sarah and Christopher. Nyalandu is a Christian.

S. Lewis as the primary location for his series of seven fantasy novels for children, The Chronicles of Narnia. The series tracks the story of Narnia when humans, usually children, enter the Narnian world from 'our world', or Earth, and meet Aslan, the creator of the world, in the book. The world is named after the country of Narnia, in which much of the action of the Chronicles takes place. In Narnia, some animals can talk, mythical beasts abound, and magic is common.  What type of thing is Narnia?  Narnia can be described as all of the following: * Fiction - form of narrative which deals, in part or in whole, with events that are not factual, but rather, imaginary and invented by its author(s). Although fiction often describes a major branch of literary work, it is also applied to theatrical, cinematic, and musical work. ** Fantasy fiction - form of narrative from the genre of fiction that commonly uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary plot element, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common. *** High fantasy fiction - a type of fantasy fiction defined either by its setting in an imaginary world or by the epic stature of its characters, themes and plot.Brian Stableford, The A to Z of Fantasy Literature, (p. 198), Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005. The term \\"high fantasy\\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \\"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\\". *** a fantasy world - fictional setting comprising an entire planet, used in fantasy fiction, for example in novels and games. Typical worlds involve magic or magical abilities and often, but not always, either a medieval or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. ** a fictional setting - *** a fictional universe - a universe that is made up. The Chronicles of Narnia describe a fictional universe with many worlds and dimensions, including Earth, Narnia, and others. **** a constructed world - ***** a fantasy world - fictional setting comprising an entire planet, used in fantasy fiction, for example in novels and games. Typical worlds involve magic or magical abilities and often, but not always, either a medieval or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. ***** a paracosm - **** a fictional parallel universe - * Intellectual property - creations of the mind. Intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works. ** a media franchise - collection of media whereby intellectual property (IP) is licensed from an original work of media (usually a work of fiction), such as a film, a work of literature, a television program or a video game, to other parties or partners for commercial exploitation. A property can be exploited across a range of mediums and by a variety of industries for merchandising purposes. Narnia has been marketed in the form of books and movies, soundtracks (music) of the movies are available, and Narnian characters have been portrayed on T-shirts, have been sold as toys, etc.  The Chronicles of Narnia media franchise  * Published works ** Author: C.S. Lewis *** The Chronicles of Narnia - series of seven high fantasy novels by C. S. Lewis, about the adventures of children who play central roles in the unfolding history of the fictional realm of Narnia, a place where animals talk, magic is common, and good battles evil.

History In 1981, MFM was created in Lyon, then named as Radio Montmartre, and proposed a format essentially based on French chansons from the 1920s till the 1960s. Following a certain success, Radio Montmartre extended its coverage in the late 1980s. In 1995, it was authorized by the CSA to change its name to \\"Montmartre FM\\". Until 1998, MFM was controlled by the RMC Group. The station was then acquired by LV & Co who were owned by G√©rard Louvin. After the purchase, Montmartre FM became known simply as MFM. In April 2007, the programming was made around a musical format focused on relaxation and emotion, broadcasting mainly songs from the 1970s to today. Since then, it always plays \\"40 minutes of ad-free music\\" for EVERY hour of the day. The format was changed to be aimed at mainly women between 35 and 49 years. The slogan of the station was, at the time, \\"l'√âmotion partag√©e\\". At the beginning of 2007, new radio hosts arrived at the radio station, including Thierry Debrune in the morning.

From 1881 to 1920, the organization struggled to secure women's right to vote. Its members organized marches, wrote petitions and letters, gathered signatures, gave speeches, and published pamphlets and broadsheets to force the Minnesota Legislature to recognize their right to vote. Due to their efforts, the legislature approved the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919. History=Origins= Sarah Burger Stearns was named the organization's first president in 1881. In the 1870s, many women across Minnesota organized local women's suffrage groups. In 1875, the Minnesota legislature recognized women's right to vote in school board elections. However, many women wanted to vote in all elections. Seeing the need for a statewide agency, fourteen women formed the MWSA in Hastings in 1881. The Minnesota chapter was affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Among the founders of the MWSA were Harriet Bishop and Sarah Burger Stearns. Stearns became the organization's first president. By 1882, the MWSA had grown to two hundred members. In 1885, MWSA- president Martha Ripley convinced NAWSA to hold their annual meeting in Minnesota. This national event demonstrated the importance of the Minnesota chapter to the larger organization. It also drew the attention of Minnesota's male lawmakers. In 1893, the MWSA convinced the Minnesota Senate to take up women's suffrage. President Julia Bullard Nelson worked with Ignatius Donnelly, a Populist state senator. The Populists regularly supported a women's suffrage plank. Nelson herself was a Populist school superintendent candidate in 1894. Nelson and Donnelly initially sought the vote for women in municipal elections. However, the Senate went further. Its members voted to remove the word \\"male\\"¬ù from the state's voting requirements. The bill passed thirty-two to nineteen. However, this change did not pass the House. That chamber did not have time to take it up before the legislative session ended. Even if it had passed the House, however, the voters of Minnesota would have had to approve it before it became law. After the failure of the 1893 amendment, the movement continued. However, the MWSA was unable to build on its earlier success. The MWSA and its ally, the Political Equality Club, placed women's suffrage before the state legislature every session. Each time, the bill either died in committee or was defeated. =In the early 20th century= During the 1910s, the movement picked up momentum again. In 1914, Clara Ueland - who would later become the MWSA's president in 1915 - organized a parade through Minneapolis of over 2000 suffrage supporters. This event gave the movement renewed attention. During this period, the MWSA had to contend with a rival organization, a Minnesota branch of the National Woman's Party (NWP). The NWP was more radical than the MWSA. It was much more likely to take direct action, such as hunger strikes, than the MWSA. Despite these differences in opinion, the two organizations often worked together. By 1919, 30,000 women across the state officially belonged to local suffrage associations. They joined the MWSA, the NWP, and other organizations. Their numbers and continued activities convinced lawmakers to act. In 1919, the Minnesota legislature recognized women's right to vote in presidential elections. The same year, the legislature ratified the Nineteenth Amendment. However, the amendment did not take effect until 1920, when it was ratified by two-thirds the required of the states. =Present Day= With their right to vote secured, the MWSA became the Minnesota League of Women Voters, selecting Clara Ueland as their first president. The League is still active in Minnesota politics today, publishing a voting guide to inform voters on candidate positions on issues affecting women. A memorial to the achievements of the MWSA currently stands on the lawn of the Minnesota State Capitol and is known as the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Memorial.

The character debuted on-screen on 1 July 1997. Sam Meikle played the character for one episode. When Richard Grieve quit his role as James' brother Lachlan Fraser; producers cast Michael Piccilliri to play James. They had invested time in Lachlan's relationship with Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright) and wanted to replace the character. James soon begins a relationship with Chloe. Producers were pleased with his performance and invited him to join the show's regular cast. Like Lachlan, James is portrayed as a doctor employed at the local hospital. Piccilliri has described James as an individual who balances his career with his social life. He is also addicted to love and his relationship with Chloe is problematic. The duo marry but soon separate. Piccilliri quit Home and Away in 1999 and departed on 5 April 2000. His exit storyline played out James departing Summer Bay after realising that Chloe does not love him. The actor briefly reprised the role in 2005 following Chloe's death. Creation and casting James appears in an episode (played by Sam Meikle) in which he helps his brother Lachlan (Richard Grieve) hide a family secret from his girlfriend Shannon Reed (Isla Fisher). In 1998, Grieve decided to leave Home and Away. Lachlan has a relationship with Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright). Producers had invested much time into developing their storylines and wanted them to continue. They decided to reintroduce James and paired him with Chloe instead. But the role was recast and Michael Piccirilli won the role. He told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that \\"the purpose of my character was to come in and marry the girl who was having my brother's baby.\\" Piccirilli was modelling in London when he submitted a screen test video tape to series producer Russell Webb. He thought that Piccirilli was perfect for the role and arranged a meeting with him. The actor travelled to Sydney and secured the role. It was Piccirilli's first television role and he viewed it as an \\"amazing opportunity and experience\\". The character was officially promoted to the regular cast on 15 October 1998. Herbison reported that producers initiated the return because Piccirilli had proved a \\"big hit\\" for the show. Development A writer from the serial's official website said that an upper-class upbringing, James is an \\"easygoing and likeable\\" person. His mother, Diana (Kerry McGuire), enjoys interfering in her children's personal lives. But unlike Lachlan, James is likely to stand up to her and refuses to tolerate her interfering. When James arrived in the show he was immediately put to work treating fellow characters in need. Piccirilli told Herbison that he treated just about everyone in Summer Bay. He added \\"I had to learn lots of medical jargon, although there was a nurse on set which made it easier\\". Picirrilli has claimed that he is similar to his character. He told Wendy Granditer of Inside Soap that \\"James loves nature and the outdoors and so do I. But the main similarity between us is that he doesn't necessarily want to put his career before his life. He tends to give them both equal balance. We're both addicted to love, too.\\" On James‚Äô arrival he is attracted to Chloe, the mother of Lachie‚Äôs daughter, Olivia. He knows Chloe still loves Lachie and tries to fight his feelings for her but soon falls for her. As Inside Soap's Herbison wrote, James had been insistent that he only wanted to support Chloe; but he ends up declaring his love. Grieve had agreed to reprise his role as Lachlan to accommodate the development of their relationship. James gives Chloe a ticket to visit Lachlan and resolve her feelings. The actor said told Annette Dasey from Inside Soap that he sympathised with James because he had been through a similar experience. Chloe discovers that Lachlan married another woman and she decides to be with James. Piccirilli believed that James and Chloe's romance was popular with viewers. On one occasion the actor was out in public with his girlfriend and a female viewer started shouting at him. She believed in the couple so much that she accused Piccirilli of being unfaithful to Chloe. James and Chloe's wedding was broadcast in March 1999. James nearly cancels the ceremony, suspecting that Chloe has a photograph of Lachlan in her locket. But Chloe reveals that it contains James' picture and they marry. The episodes featuring the wedding were filmed over two days. Piccirilli decided to wear his own Prada suit for the occasion. Wright told Steven Murphy from Inside Soap that Chloe's decision to marry James was a mistake. She was surprised that her character would marry a man she did not love. She added \\"I'd warn Chloe strongly against going through with it and I'm sure viewers would agree with me.\\" Chloe does not love James as much as she did Lachlan, but she thinks that James can offer Olivia a stable and life. Wright opined that the couple do not have the \\"special something\\", but Chloe believes that it could happen. Wright said that the shock from James stopping the ceremony to confront her about her locket nearly kills her character with humiliation. In November 1999, Herbison reported that Piccirilli had left Home and Away to go travelling. James exit storyline depicted him leaving Summer Bay when he realised that Chloe did not love him. The actor was happy with James' material because he got to do \\"some good dramatic stuff\\", despite only filming for eighteen months. Asked if he would return in 2004, the actor said \\"if I went back now, I'd be doing something I've already done. What would be the point?\\" But Piccirilli returned to the show in 2005. His return storyline features him returning to Summer Bay to gain custody of Olivia. Storylines James is first seen at a family lunch at his parents‚Äô house when Lachie brings his girlfriend Shannon to meet the family. James reappears the following year when he takes a position at Northern District's hospital. James uses this position to get closer to Chloe, the mother of Lachlan's daughter, Olivia. Chloe is suspicious of him at first and accuses of him being a spy for his mother, Diana but he assures her is not. He leaves to start his own practice in the country but returns several months later. James takes in an interest in Chloe but she is not over Lachie. He gives her a ticket to visit Lachie in America for Thanksgiving but when Chloe arrives she finds Lachie with a new partner, Dana and is heartbroken. James comforts Chloe when she returns and they grow closer together and he helps her with Olivia. After Olivia is treated for a heart murmur and recovers following a successful surgery, James and Chloe become a couple but are faced with the interference of Diana, who does not like Chloe. Diana continues playing mind games but the couple, make plans to marry. On the day of the wedding, James begins to have doubts as Chloe admits she still loves Lachie, and he leaves her at the altar but returns and they marry. However, The marriage quickly begins to show signs of strain when James wants a child of his own with Chloe but she is against the idea. She initially agrees but begins secretly taking contraceptive pills. James is enraged by the lies and they briefly separate. Chloe is keen to make the marriage work but following Lachie's death and Chloe's admission she never loved James the way she loved Lachie, things become and there is no return for the couple. Diana schemes to gain custody of Olivia but ultimately fails and has a breakdown as a result. Chloe leaves but she and James agree to remain friends Following Chloe's departure, James begins taking in tenants Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson), Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson) and later Harry Reynolds (Justin Melvey). He also enjoys romantic attention from Danielle McCarthy (Claire Parradine) and nurse Juliette Bellati (Nicole Nabout). He lets Danielle down gently but is surprised to discover a gift for his 30th birthday left by Juliette who is revealed to be his secret admirer. After a shaky start, James and Juliette begin dating. They then leave the bay together. Five years later, following Chloe's death in a car crash caused by Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin), James returns to Summer Bay in the middle of a custody battle between Diana and Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) over Olivia. He reveals that he is the executor of Chloe's will and tells Irene that Chloe's will stipulates that Diana will not get custody and Olivia will live James as per Chloe's wishes. Olivia is delighted and they leave for the UK. Reception Inside Soap's Dasey opined that James was a \\"lovelorn\\" character.

The Confederate States Army revival was a series of Christian revivals which took place among the Confederate States Army in 1863. It is generally regarded as part of the Third Great Awakening. Benjamin R. Lacy suggests that the revival began in the camps and hospitals around Richmond, Virginia. The revival began in the Army of Northern Virginia in early 1863. In March 1863, for example, a new chaplain arrived at the 41st Virginia Infantry regiment and found the beginnings of a revival.Henderson, William D. 41st Virginia Infantry. H.E. Howard, Inc., 1986, , pp 35-37. The revival was encouraged by Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee and by the middle of the 1863 it had spread to all the Confederate armies. Mark Summers argues, however, that Jackson and Lee were exceptional as far as enthusiasm among the officers went, and rather than a \\"top down\\" revival (the traditional Lost Cause of the Confederacy view), it was much more \\"bottom up\\", as thousands of religious tracts were distributed among the soldiers. Summers suggests that due to the Union blockade, the soldiers had little else to read. According to the Confederate chaplain J. William Jones, by the end of the war, 150,000 soldiers had been converted. Kurt O. Berends argues that the revivals were a major cultural event. Ben House suggests that the revivals provided \\"the spiritual resources that would be necessary to enable the South to survive defeat and Reconstruction with a strong Bible base still intact.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Carroll, Dillon J., \\"'The God Who Shielded Me Before, Yet Watches Over Us All': Confederate Soldiers, Mental Illness, and Religion,\\" Civil War History, 61 (Sept. 2015), 252‚Äì80. * Faust, Drew Gilpin. \\"Christian Soldiers: The Meaning of Revivalism in the Confederate Army.\\" Journal of Southern History (1987): 63-90. online  Miller, Randall M.

Beales was considered one of the leading experts on roses, especially species and classic roses, preserving many old varieties and introducing 70 new cultivars during his lifetime. He served as the President of the Royal National Rose Society from 2003 until 2005. Speaking of his contribution on BBC news, Alan Titchmarsh said: \\"It was the old and classic roses that Peter loved best and by growing them and making them available to a wider range of gardeners, he did tremendous work in terms of our rose-growing heritage.\\" Early life and career Peter Leslie Beales was born in Norfolk on 22 July 1936 and brought up by his grandparents near North Walsham. He studied at Norwich City College and then trained with LeGrice Roses in North Walsham before National Service, during which time he met his wife Joan. Peter then worked as manager at Hillings Rose Nursery in Surrey, under the guidance of legendary rosarian Graham Stuart Thomas. He succeeded Thomas as foreman of roses. Establishment of rose nursery In 1968, Peter Beales started Peter Beales Roses Ltd. ‚Äì initially in Swardeston, Norfolk, before moving to the market town of Attleborough. Beales' passion and specialism was wild and classic breeds of roses, many of which he saved from extinction by collecting and breeding them. Over time, the family-run nursery grew to become a major specialist centre, growing and retailing over 1,200 different varieties of rose. Beales' nursery holds more than 100 types of wild roses, recognised by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) as the most extensive collection of its kind in Britain. Beales' nursery also holds the National Collection of Rosa Spp (species roses). Peter Beales Roses has bred and introduced more than 70 rose cultivars. The company set up a full e-commerce website in 1997.

The RHS awarded Peter Beales the Victoria Medal of Honour, the society's top award, in 2003 for his work to promote gardening and roses. Publishing and speaking career The first publications from Peter Beales were pamphlets for a Jarrolds series on roses in the 1970s. His first major publication was the book Classic Roses in 1985. Other titles followed, including Twentieth-Century Roses in 1988, Roses in 1992, Visions of Roses in 1996, New Classic Roses in 1997, and A Passion for Roses in 2004. He lectured around the world on the subject and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Garden Media Guild in 2009. Beales was appointed an MBE in 2005.

On the American frontier, the term usually applies to the person responsible for assisting groups of immigrants or pioneers from the eastern US to the western US. Wagon masters were also hired to oversee shipments of cargo or mail. A group of wagons traveling together were referred to as a \\"train\\". The trip across the western US by wagon was long and very difficult. Typically, a wagon train would travel at around two miles an hour, which would only permit the train to average a little over ten miles a day. Therefore, the 2,000 mile journey from Missouri to California or Oregon would take about five to six months depending on weather or other difficulties. Responsibilities The job of wagon master was very important as the difference between a good and skilled wagon master and one who wasn't was often the difference between life and death. The wagon master had many responsibilities. It was vital that the wagon master be a knowledgeable and skilled individual in order for the people and goods to travel safely across the country. The wagon master also had to be familiar with the trail that they would be traveling. He would have to know what the terrain was going to be that the wagons were going to travel over, where the wagons could go and where they would not be able to go. It was important that the wagon master also have experience at such things as: * Survival * Fighting and warfare ‚Äì to fend off attacks * Animal husbandry ‚Äì to care for sick and injured animals * Mechanics ‚Äì to repair broken wagons * Hunting - to supplement the immigrant's diet along the journey * Climate and weather ‚Äì so he could determine when a storm would make travel too dangerous * Terrain ‚Äì to know where to go that a wagon could get through * Medical and dental knowledge * Negotiating and counseling to handle disputes between land owners, outlaws, Native Americans, or between those within the group Most initial wagon masters were mountain men who knew the terrain and had learned many of the skills that were required to lead a group of unskilled travelers. Operations Crossing the continent by wagon was an extremely expensive enterprise. It was estimated that the journey cost a family about $1,000 (approximately ). They had to have special wagon that could handle the weight and rough use. These wagons typically would cost about $400 (approximately ). The wagons had wooden hoops that went from one side to the other which were covered by a canvas top which would be waterproofed with linseed oil. The canvas protected the immigrants and their goods from weather and the sun. The wagons would be packed with food supplies, cooking equipment, water kegs, and other things needed for a long journey. Knowing that this was the only chance they had to transport their goods and that they may not be able to get what they needed where they were going, the pioneers usually over-packed their wagons. This often led to the wagons breaking down and the draw animals being overly fatigued. It was common to see route along the wagon trails littered with household items that had been cast off along the journey. When the wagon train would stop for any length of time, at night for instance, the wagons were arranged, end to end, in a circular or square pattern. This served two purposes, one as a corral for the animals and secondly, as protection against a possible attacks. The main cause of death on the overland trails was \\"accidental\\" shootings, although it is unclear how many were truly accidental. The second most prevalent reason for death was drowning, as the immigrants would have to cross dangerous rivers with their animals and wagons. Other reasons for people dying on the trip included sickness, disease, fighting, wild animals, and old age.

Its wood is sometimes used to make furniture. It is native to Central America and southern Mexico, but is grown throughout the tropics. Roseodendron chryseum is endemic to the dry forests of northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. It is known as araguaney, a name that also applies to Handroanthus chrysanthus. It differs from R. donnell-smithii in its smaller stature, smaller fruit, and more compact inflorescence. The inflorescence is a panicle, but appears racemose because of the short lateral branches and pedicels.Alwyn H. Gentry. 1992. \\"Bignoniaceae: Part II (Tribe Tecomeae)\\".

In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that Roseodendron is not closer to Tabebuia than Ekmanianthe, not closer to Cybistax than are Godmania and Zeyheria, and not closer to Handroanthus than are Spirotecoma, Parmentiera, Crescentia, and Amphitecna.Susan O.

Description  * The wood is not especially heavy or hard, like that of Handroanthus. * The indumentum is of lepidote scales and small glandular hairs. * The inflorescence has an erect and sturdy central rachis. * The calyx is spathaceous, usually somewhat viscid, and is soft and thin like the corolla. * The corolla is yellow and sometimes has thin, red lines. * The fruit is bullate and irregularly costate. The calyx texture and inflorescence structure of Roseodendron distinguish it clearly from Handroanthus and Tabebuia. The fruit ridges are much more conspicuous than those of any species of Tabebuia.

Miranda assigned to Roseodendron the same 2 species that it includes today. Both of these species were transferred back to Tabebuia by Alwyn H. Gentry in 1992. In that year, Gentry published a taxonomic revision of Tabebuia in Flora Neotropica. He divided Tabebuia into 10 species groups, including all of the species now placed in Roseodendron and Handroanthus. His group 1 corresponds to Roseodendron. In 2007, a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences resolved Roseodendron as one member of a tetratomy that is sister to Sparattosperma, the most basal clade in the Tabebuia alliance. A phylogenetic tree can be seen at Bignoniaceae. The Tabebuia alliance is an informally named monophyletic group that is not placed at any taxonomic rank. It consists of genera that had formerly been placed in the tribe Tecomeae.Richard G. Olmstead, Michelle L. Zjhra, L√∫cia G. Lohmann, Susan O. Grose, and Andrew J.

Life After Jesuit missionary Rev. Andrew White healed his son in 1639, Kittamaquund converted his family to the Catholic faith. Two years later, he sent his seven-year-old daughter, renamed Mary at her baptism, to be raised by Governor Leonard Calvert and his sister-in-law Margaret Brent.A photograph of Mary at her father's baptism, from a painting in the Maryland State Archives, is published in Kenneth Bryson, Images of America: Accokeek (Arcadia Publishing, 2013) p.12W.B. Chilton, The Brent Family, in Genealogies of Virginia Families: From the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (Baltimore, Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc. 1981) Vol. 1, pp. 314-316. Kittamaquund wanted the English colony's leaders to educate Mary so she could communicate between the two cultures, and solicit their help against hostile tribes.George and Virginia Schaun, Maryland: Biographical Sketches (Maryland Historical Press, 1984) pp. 11-12. Margaret Brent and her other unmarried sister Mary Brent were probably religious women, affiliated with the Mary Ward society, because they never married yet retained high status within the Maryland colony. The Mary Ward society was founded on the pattern of the Society of Jesus, and pioneered in the area of apostolic congregations of sisters.http://home.comcast.net/~jacksonday/marykit.htm =Maryland= Trading and religious conflicts, including the religious wars resuming in England, shaped Mary Kittamaquund's life. In late 1644, in Governor Calvert's absence, Margaret Brent had allowed her 38-year-old brother Giles to marry Mary Kittamaquund, though she was just 10 or 11 years old at the time. According to various reports. Calvert was either in England with his brother soliciting support for the Maryland colony, or collecting debts and hiring soldiers in Virginia to protect it. In any event, during his absence, on February 14, 1645, raiders led by Protestant sea captain and merchant Richard Ingle and his ally Virginia fur trader William Claiborne burned the Catholic chapel and other buildings at St. Mary's City and tried to destroy the new colony. The previous year, during Governor Calvert's absence, Giles Brent had briefly jailed Ingle for treason against King Charles I. When Ingle returned, he carried letters of marque and reprisal against the king's supporters issued by the Protestant Parliament. The Ingle/Claiborne raiders also raided and burned houses of Catholic settlers on Kent Island, which had begun competing with Claiborne's former post there (which burned down in 1631 but had been rebuilt) and another of his posts at Palmer's Island. In April, Ingle and Claiborne sailed back to England with both Jesuit priests, the provincial secretary and Giles Brent all as captives and in chains.In 1649, Edward Commins paid for the damage caused by Claiborne and Ingle's raiders at least to their property on Kent Island. Chilton, notes on pp. 314-315 Between December 1646 and April 1647, Governor Calvert's forces finally managed to repel the invaders (which reduced the Maryland colony from approximately 500 to 600 settlers to about 100 English). However, Calvert then fell ill and died on June 9, 1647. He had named Margaret Brent his executor, and told her to settle matters. In order to pay the mercenaries to go back across the Potomac River to Virginia, she sold Calvert's cattle. When Calvert's brother Lord Baltimore later learned this, he was upset, probably not realizing the danger his colony had faced. At some time during this period, chief Kittamaquund died, and Giles Brent (who had been freed in England and returned to Maryland) claimed all the Piscataway lands as Mary's husband. This violated Piscataway tribal customs and also conflicted with Lord Baltimore's land grant, which had given rise to the English colony in the first place.Chilton, note at p. 315. Moreover, Claiborne's erstwhile Susquehannock trading partners took their furs to the new Swedish trading post at Fort Christina.Stephen R. Potter, Commoners, Tribute, and Chiefs: the Development of Alconquian Culture in the Potomac Valley (University of Virginia Press, 1993) p. 191. =Virginia= Nevertheless, Giles and young Mary stayed together, moving to Chopawamsic Island in the Potomac River in 1647, then the following year to the Colony of Virginia in what is now the Northern Neck near Aquia, Virginia.John T. Goolrick, The Story of Stafford (1976) p. 14 Giles set up a trading post, shortly after the third Anglo-Powhatan War, and ultimately a plantation named Retirement. His sisters Margaret and Mary later joined them and lived at Giles' first Virginia plantation, named Peace, in what became Stafford, Virginia.Daniel M. French, Brent Family: the Carroll Families of Colonial Maryland (Alexandria, Va 1981) p. 36. Later Brents eventually built others nearby called Woodstock and Richland. Margaret Brent perfected title to many acres of land in Virginia, as she had earlier in Maryland, based upon headrights earned for people helped to emigrate across the Atlantic Ocean to the colony. According to Daniel French (at p. 37), Mary Kittamaquund died before Giles married Frances Wingreave Harrison (with whom he had no children). Furthermore, their son Giles married his first cousin Mary, daughter of George Brent and Marianna Peyton, while his sister Mary married Capt. John Fitzherbert but died childless. =Genealogy= Mary Kittamaquund was the daughter of Kittamaquund, Tayac of the Piscataway (Paramount Chief of the Piscataway Tribes) and Mary Piscataway (Kittamaquund). Scholars disagree about the number of children born to Mary Kittamaquund and Giles Brent. Some list only three children named in the 1663 and 1671 wills of Giles Brent and his sister Margaret. Margaret Brent appointed her brother Giles ‚Äúand his children Giles (Jr) Brent, Mary Brent, and Richard Brent‚Äù executors of her estate. Giles left bequests to his son Giles (Jr) Brent and daughter Mary Brent (Fitzherbert). Other historians, such as Dr. Lois Green Carr, Maryland Historian at the Maryland State Archives, on the basis of information gleaned from provincial court records, probate records, and quitrent rolls, identify six children of Mary and Giles, including Katherine Brent (who married Richard Marsham), Giles (Jr) Brent (who married his cousin Mary Brent), Mary Brent (who married John Fitzherbert), Richard Brent (who died after December 26, 1663), Henry Brent (who died young), and Margaret Brent (who also died young). Considering recent DNA evidence, it now seems certain Mary Kittamaquund and Giles Brent were the parents of Katherine, wife of Richard Marsham, and of Mary, wife first of John Fitzherbert and second of Charles Beaven. Lost and forgotten No records exist concerning Mary Kittamaquund's death, although in 1654 Giles Brent married Frances Whitegreave Harrison, who had emigrated from England to York County, Virginia, the previous year and had been wife of the recently deceased Dr. Jeremiah Harrison. Thus it is unclear whether Mary died as a young woman (childbirth deaths being common), or whether she left Giles and resumed her (matrilineal) Native American identity, or he divorced her as discussed below. In any event, Giles and Frances either had two or no children.Chilton p. 319 argues no issue, and at p. 323 includes a lawsuit verdict from 1737 stating that this Giles' only heir was his son Giles, who died about age 30, intestate and without issue, but does not explain why 16-year-old William Brent was the only heir-at-law of the younger Giles. The last wills and testaments of Giles (d. 1671) and Margaret (d. 1663) mention Giles' six children \\"of which four lived,\\" but not his wife Mary.Chilton's transcription of Giles Brent's will only mentions his daughter Mary Fitzherbert and son Giles, and that of Margaret Brent's will mentions Giles' children as Giles, Mary and Richard. Chilton at pp. 319-322. Giles' other quasi-monastic sister Mary died in 1658.French at p. 44 mentions Sarah E. Claggett's assertion that this Mary married a ship captain, Henry Rogers, and settled at St. Gabriels, Kent Island, but disbelieves that assertion, in part because in her will she only referred to herself, never mentioning a husband. If Mary Kittamaquund left or outlived Giles Sr. and returned to become a Piscataway matriarch, she could have moved to Brent lands in Maryland. St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Newport, Maryland) has a Brent family graveyard, as well as a section for burials now unknown, although the church itself was built two centuries after Kittamaquund's contact. Another more modern Catholic church near the Brent family's lands in Pomonkey, Maryland (named for another related tribe) and near Port Tobacco which became the Charles County, Maryland, county seat and a major slave trading port until it silted up also has a graveyard. Mary also could have moved further north, for her tribe traded throughout the Chesapeake Bay region, even though it was decimated by war and disease in this era. While the oldest, continuous, English-speaking, Catholic congregation in the United States is St. Francis Xavier in St. Mary's, Maryland (which replaced its chapel in 1660 and is relatively close to Newport though not Port Tobacco), the second oldest is St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland) in Cecil County, Maryland. This other important trading area near the Elk Neck Peninsula allowed trade with Iroquois-speaking Susquehannocks who had a settlement near Conowingo, as well as with Delaware Valley and Delmarva Peninsula tribes (including the Algonquian-speaking Lenape and Nanticoke). Swedes established a trading post, Fort Christina, at the top of the Elk Neck peninsula near the shortest route between the Chesapeake and Delaware basins. St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church (in northeast Maryland not far from Warwick) was founded during the early Colonial era as some of Mary's Algonquian-speaking Piscataway sold their land in Charles and St. Georges counties and moved north. =Black Sheep Son= In May 1679, Mary Kittamaquund Brent ‚Äì or more probably another Mary Brent (perhaps born in Worcestershire, England, around 1650)However, Chilton says the second Giles' wife was Mary, sister of George Brent of Woodstock, and who became the mother of William Brent. Chilton at p. 324. ‚Äì received the first legal marital separation in Virginia. The governor and Executive Council of Virginia issued it on the grounds of her husband's \\"inhumane usage\\", but the underlying documents are lost. Mary Kittamaquund's son, Giles Brent Jr. (ca. 1652-1679) had been arrested in 1677 for his actions in Bacon's Rebellion, especially for killing friendly Doeg Indians and (with his neighbor and friend George Mason II and about 30 militiamen) taking their land (part of which later became George Washington's estate Mount Vernon).Eby, pp. 7-8.It now hosts the American Horticultural Society and the masonic National Sojourners society.http://www.masonicworld.com/education/files/artjun02/NATIONAL%20SOJOURNERS.htm Because Giles Brent had laid down his arms and joined Lord Berkeley's forces, he was not hanged like many other rebels.Chilton at pp. 321-322 cites two sources that George Brent captained Berkeley's forces (variously of 1200 or 1000 men) but that his troops ran away rather than attack Bacon's forces. French at p. 39 states that Giles Brent received a commission from Bacon before changing allegiances and commanding the 1000 to 1200 men loyal to the Governor. However, Giles' half-Native ancestry could have caused problems both with the rebels (some of whom wanted to kill all Indians) and with racist elements in Berkeley's faction. In any event, shortly following his divorce from Mary Brent, Giles Brent married Frances Hammersley (b. 1660 and death date unknown) of Middlesex County, but he then died within a few months. His father had patented claims for 1800 acres in his name, which had been across from the Piscataway town and later became part of Alexandria, Virginia. =Virginia's hidden Catholics= Although the English-born Brent women never married or had children, the Brents became the only publicly Catholic family in Virginia for more than a century.Gerald Fogarty, Commonwealth Catholics: A History of the Catholic Church in Virginia (University of Notre Dame Press, 2001) pp. 13-19. Mary Kittamaquund supposedly lived with Mary Brent and Margaret Brent. Rumors persisted of a Catholic church, monastery or retreat house in the area long before St. Mary's Church was founded in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1795 by George Washington's aide, Col. John Fitzgerald. Brent men continued as merchants and lawyers, and also owned and operated plantations and a quarry near the Occoquan River's junction with the Potomac. George Brent (d. 1694) became the only Catholic delegate in the House of Burgesses in colonial times (representing Stafford County in 1688),French pp. 48-49 also mentions that his fifth son, Edward, died in Douai, France in 1676 before his ordination to the priesthood and in 1686 received title with three London partners to 30,000 acres later known as Brent town where Catholics could legally practice their religion.http://eservice.pwcgov.org/library/digitallibrary/hsdw/B_Folder/BrentTownSite&Grant76-163;/pdfs/BrentTownSite&Grant76-163SurvA.pdf; As anti-Catholicism grew in Virginia ‚Äì both paralleling developments in the mother country as well as reflecting local conflicts with French and Spanish fur traders and their Native American allies ‚Äì Brents held no further governmental positions outside their local community for nearly a century. Moreover, George Brent was forced to take cover at his law partner's house for five months in 1688 over false rumors that he was conspiring with Indians about an uprising.Chilton at pp. 338-339. Nonetheless, neighbors in what became Spotsylvania County, Stafford County, Fairfax County and Alexandria, Virginia, seem to have spared successive generations of lawyer Brents from the required anti-Catholic oath. Around the time of the American Revolution, William Brent and Richard Brent married the sisters of John Carroll, a Jesuit before the brief suppression of that order, and who himself became the first native Catholic bishop in what became the United States. William Brent and Richard Brent became revolutionaries and Founding Fathers, though less noticed than Marylanders Charles Carroll and Daniel Carroll (whose first wife was William Brent's daughter Anna). In 1780, subject to an elaborate but incomplete prenuptial agreement, their 50-year-old maiden sister Sarah Brent became the second wife of George Mason, who worked to establish religious freedom in Virginia and the new nation.Oddly, Chilton pp. 331-332 fails to mention this Sarah Brent. =Erased past= British raiders burned Brent family estates during the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812.French, David M., 'The Brent Family, The Carroll Families of Colonial Maryland,' Alexandria, VA, David M. French, 1981. Thus, they may have sustained more damage than their revolutionary Protestant neighbors. William Brent and Robert Brent became public servants in Washington, D.C., shortly after its founding (and at least one wrote and recorded a will to manumit his slave and allow him to retain his freedom without leaving the area, not having a large estate). However, the Virginia Brents eventually became strong supporters of slavery and the Confederacy. They developed Brentsville, Virginia, in western Prince William County in the 1820s. Alexandria sent lawyer George William Brent (1821-1872) to the Virginia Convention of 1861, at which he argued for union in order to support slavery. During the Civil War, Union troops secured a gun emplacement on Brent property overlooking the Potomac River near Aquia creek, and vandalized the nearby Brent family graveyard, removing brass name plates. Brentsville also sustained more damage than surrounding properties during that war. Honors *Virginia erected a historical marker to honor Mary Kittamaquund in 2009. It stands on the historic road to Richmond (Route 1), in front of the Aquia post office, about two miles south of the crucifix erected in 1930 to honor the first Catholic settlers in Virginia and Margaret Brent, as well as the later road marker honoring the same English people. A nearby plaque mentions the capture of Pocahontas when visiting the Stafford area about two decades before Mary Kittamaquund's birth. *Lake Kittamaqundi reservoir in Columbia, Maryland, honors the tribe of which Kittamaquund's father was chief and it honors Mary, sometimes called a \\"princess.\\"Agle, Nan Hayden, Princess Mary of Maryland, Tradition Press, 1967.

All three levels play an important role in terms of funding, policies and facilities. Each major sport is managed by a national sports organisation, with state counterparts that manage community sporting clubs. Umbrella or peak organisations represent the interests of sports organisations or particular sport issues. Education sector plays a small role through universities and schools. Private sector's involvement is extensive in professional sport through facilities, club ownership and finance/sponsorship. Government Government involvement in sport up until the 1970s was fairly limited with local governments playing a major role through the provision of sporting facilities. However, this changed over the next two decades with an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 2001‚Äì2002 finding that approximately $2 billion was spent on sport by three levels of government ‚Äì 10 per cent from the Australian Government, 40 per cent from state and territory governments, and the remaining 50 per cent from local government. State, territory and local government spending was predominantly directed to facilities and their upkeep. This amount most likely has increased since that survey. National Approach In 1973, the Recreation Minister's Council was established to provide a forum for Australian Government and State and Territory Minister's responsible for sport and recreation to discuss matters of interest. With government's taking an increased involvement in sport, it became the Sport and Recreation Minister's Council. More recently is referred to as Meeting of Sport and Recreation Ministers. The Meeting is assisted by the Committee of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) previously called the Standing Committee on Sport and Recreation (SCORS). The Meeting works cooperatively on issues such as match fixing, sport participation and water safety. In 2011, Minister's signed the National Sport and Active Recreation Policy Framework. The framework \\"provides a mechanism for the achievement of national goals for sport and active recreation, sets out agreed roles and responsibilities of governments and their expectations of sport and active recreation partners.\\" In 1993, National Elite Sports Council was established to provide a forum for communication, issues management and national program co-ordination across the high performance in Australia. It includes representatives from AIS, State Institute /Academies, Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association. In 2011, National Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement provides \\"guidance on how the sector will operate, with a principal focus on the delivery of the high performance plans of national sporting organisations.\\" =Australian Government= Australian Government provided small amounts of funding in the 1950s and 1960s through the support of the National Fitness Council and international sporting teams such as the Australian Olympic team. The Australian Government's serious involvement and investment into sport came with it establishing the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 1981. AIS was set up to improve Australia's performances in international sport which had started to decline in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in Australia winning no gold medals at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 1985, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) was established to improve the Australian Government's administration of sport in terms of funding, participation and elite sport. The 1989 Senate Inquiry into drugs in sport resulted in the establishment of the Australian Sport Drug Agency (now called Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA)) in 1990 to manage Australia's anti-doping program. The Minister for Sport is supported by the Office of Sport located in their department. The Office's works with the key agencies ASC and ASADA in the development of sport. Currently, the Office's main focus is in integrity of sport and bidding and hosting of major events in Australia. =State Governments= State and Territory governments have a department with responsibility for sport and recreation. These departments provide assistance to state sports organisations, develop and manage sporting facilities, provide financial assistance for major sporting events and develop policies to assist sports across their state or territory. Each Australian State and Territory has established its own institute/academy of sport ‚Äì ACT Academy of Sport (established 1989), New South Wales Institute of Sport (1996), Northern Territory Institute of Sport (1996), Queensland Academy of Sport (1991), South Australian Sports Institute (1982), Tasmanian Institute of Sport (1985), Victorian Institute of Sport (1990) and Western Australian Institute of Sport (1984). These institutes/academies and the AIS work together through the National Institutes Network and the National Elite Sports Council. Victoria and New South Wales have established regional academies. Many state governments have facility management trusts to manage their major sporting precincts and facilities. Examples are Sydney Olympic Park Authority (New South Wales) and State Sports Centre Trust (Victoria). =Local Governments= There are 560 local councils across Australia. Local governments generally focus on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, sporting fields, stadiums and tennis courts. Investment into sports development programs for local clubs is generally limited. In national sporting issues, local governments may be represented by Australian Local Government Association. Sports Organisations=National Sports Organisations= In 2012, there were 102 national sports organisations (NSO) in Australia recognised by the Australian Sports Commission. 63 NSO's received funding from ASC in 2011‚Äì2012. All of these organisations are affiliated to an international organisation and where appropriate to the Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, Australian Commonwealth Games Association and the Confederation of Australian Sport. These organisations manage the participation and high performance sport programs of the sport. Several of the national sports organisations run professional sports competitions/leagues: * Cricket Australia ‚Äì Sheffield Shield * Australian Football League ‚Äì AFL League * Australian Rugby League Commission ‚Äì National Rugby League * Australian Rugby Union ‚Äì Super Rugby * Football Federation Australia ‚Äì A-League and W-League * Basketball ‚Äì National Basketball League and Women's National Basketball League * Netball Australia ‚Äì ANZ Championship * Baseball Australia ‚Äì Australian Baseball League There are other leagues where athletes receive little remuneration. These include: * Bowls Australia * Sporting shooters association of Australia * Cricket Australia ‚Äì Women's National Cricket League * Hockey Australia ‚Äì Australian Hockey League (Men and Women) * Water Polo Australia ‚Äì Australian National Water Polo League (Men and Women) * Australian Parachute Federation ‚Äì Australian National Skydiving League =State Sports Organisations= National sports organisation generally have eight affiliated state sports organisations that manage the activities of clubs in their state. This means there are over 800 state sports organisations in Australia. Most states have an organisation that represents their interests. These include Vicsport, NSW Sports Federation, ACTSPORT, Tasmanian Sports Federation, Western Australian Sports Federation, Sport SA, and Sports Federation of Queensland. =Clubs= Community sporting clubs are regarded as the lifeblood of Australian sport. These sporting clubs are affiliated to national and state sporting organisations. In 2010, Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 2.3 million or 14% of the adult population undertook voluntary work with the sport and recreation organisations, most likely to be sporting clubs. At the club level, volunteers include coaches, officials and administrators. Clubs generally receive their limited income from membership fees. Professional sporting clubs have been established to compete in national and international leagues such as Australian Football League, National Rugby League, A-League, ANZ Championship and Super 15. Educator Sector=Universities= University sport in Australia is based primarily around the provision of sporting clubs and facilities. Only a few universities offer individual athletic scholarships. This is very different from the United States system organised by the National Collegiate Athletic Association which has well organised sports programs with scholarships. There has been a recent trend for universities to become involved with professional sporting teams. University of Canberra is a major sponsor the ACT Brumbies and Victoria University has developed a strong partnership with the Western Bulldogs. =Sport Schools= Most State Education Departments have established special sports high schools. These schools offer opportunities for talent sports students to develop sport skills in an environment that balances their sporting and education commitments. Westfield Sports High in Sydney is an example of a specialist school. Peak Organisations There are a range of peak or umbrella organisations that represent the specific interests and provide advice to governments, sports organisations and the community. * Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) ‚Äì manages Australia's participation at the Summer Olympics, Winter Olympics and Youth Olympics. * Australian Paralympic Committee (APC) ‚Äì manages Australia's participation at the Summer Paralympics and Winter Paralympics. * Australian Commonwealth Games Association (ACGA) ‚Äì manages Australia's participation at the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games. * Australian University Sport (AUS) ‚Äì manages university sport including the Australian University Games and Australia's participation at the Summer Universiade and Winter Universiade. * Confederation of Australian Sport (CAS)- * Coalition of Major Professional and Participation Sports (COMPPS) ‚Äì provides a collective response from the seven major sports * Deaf Sports Australia (DSA) - manages Australia's participation at the Summer Deaflympic Games and Winter Deaflympic Games. * Sports Medicine Australia (SMA) ‚Äì national umbrella body for sports medicine and sports science. * Sports Dietitians Australia (SDA) ‚Äì professional organisation of dietitians specialising in sports nutrition. * Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (ACHPER) ‚Äì represents the interests of professionals working in the fields of health, physical education, sport, movement sciences, dance and community fitness. * Australian Society for Sports History (ASSH) ‚Äì research and promotion of sport history in Australia. * Australian and New Zealand Sports Law Association (ANZSLA) ‚Äì education and advocacy on legal issues in Australian and New Zealand sport. * Australasian College of Sports Physicians (ACSP) ‚Äì represents Australian and New Zealand sports physicians. * Exercise and Sport Science Australia (ESSA) ‚Äì represents exercise and sports science professionals. * Australian Athletes Alliance (AAA) ‚Äì advocates on behalf of Australian athletes at the state and national levels * Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand ‚Äì research and promotion of sport management in Australia and New Zealand. * Sport Australia Hall of Fame ‚Äì recognises and promotes the sporting achievements of Australians. Private Sector This sector contributes to sport through facilities, finance and sponsorship. All professional sports competitions and their teams rely heavily on private sponsorship. This sponsorship is provided to national sports organisations and community clubs but at greatly reduced level. Only high-profile sports organisations such as Australian Football League, Australian Rugby Union, Australian Rugby League Commission and Football Federation Australia have substantial sponsorship income. Many sporting venues have been renamed to include the sponsor's name to increase revenue. Examples include Etihad Stadium, Suncorp Stadium and Paterson's Stadium. Many professional sporting teams have a private ownership model. This is a growing trend but it has not been without its difficulties.

Along with Willa Cather and others, Milmine worked as a researcher on 14 investigative articles about Eddy that were published by McClure's in 1907‚Äì1908. The only major investigative work on Eddy to be published in her lifetime besides Sibyl Wilbur's Human Life articles, the articles were instigated by Milmine: S. S.

McClure's articles First edition of The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science (1909) Before joining McClure's as a researcher, Milmine had been collecting material about Eddy for three years,\\"McClure's for 1907\\", The Daily Republican, 11 December 1906, p. 1. including court records, newspaper articles from the 1880s, and a first edition of Science and Health, which were hard to obtain. Lacking the resources to verify and write up the material, she sold it to S. S. McClure, who assigned several writers to check and expand it, including Willa Cather, Burton J. Hendrick, and Will Irwin. It was published in 14 installments between January 1907 and June 1908, and in 1909 as a book under Milmine's byline. When McClure's itself was sold, the new owner apparently threw away the research files, including the first edition of Science and Health. At least some of Milmine's research survived; it was purchased in June 1920 by The First Church of Christ, Scientist, \\"from a New York Manuscript dealer\\", according to the church.

History Throughout the 19th century, the current Kensington and Bailey areas were rural farms and timberland services. It wasn't until 1895 that the neighborhood became more urbanized, when Germans began to populate the area, mostly thanks to the construction of the Kensington Avenue street car line.

Photo series she has made include Elvis Presley fans, Marilyn Monroe impersonators, drag queens, wrestlers and bodybuilders and the recreation of photographs by Lewis Carroll using her daughter as a model. Early life and career Papapetrou was born in 1960 into a Greek immigrant family in Melbourne. She attended the University of Melbourne, graduating with a degree in Arts and Law in 1984. In 1997 she graduated with a Master of Arts degree from RMIT University and with a PhD from Monash University in 2007. She worked as a lawyer between 1985 and 2001. Papapetrou began taking photographs as early as 1987, and in her early years, she focused on cultural identity, photographing subcultures including Elvis Presley fans and impersonators, Marilyn Monroe impersonators, drag queens, body builders, circus performers and wrestlers. More recently she has focused on the representation of childhood in photography. Artistic practice Addressing issues of identity, representation and childhood, Papapetrou uses photography, scenic backdrops, landscape, costumes and masks in her work. The main protagonists in her work have been her two children Olympia Nelson (b 1997) and Solomon Nelson (b 1999). Early work Although known for her work about childhood identity, Papapetrou has explored other representations of identity. Between 1987 and 2005 Papapetrou photographed Elvis Presley fans and impersonators paying homage to Elvis Presley on the anniversary of his death at the Melbourne General Cemetery. The series, Elvis Immortal, made between 1987 and 2002, portrays Elvis Presley fans paying homage to Elvis on the anniversary of his death. Elvis Immortal was exhibited at the State Library of Victoria (1991), Bendigo Art Gallery, Victoria (1997), Old Treasury, Melbourne (1998), Nellie Castan Gallery, Melbourne (2006) and RMIT Gallery, Melbourne (2007). Her interest in Elvis Presley extended to Marilyn Monroe, a classic female icon that was as influential as Elvis Presley. She made the series Searching for Marilyn (2002). Rather than photograph fans and devotees as in Elvis Immortal, she explored ideas about Marilyn Monroe as a Hollywood creation, existing only as a constructed identity and someone whose identity was constantly changing depending on what was expected of her. Searching for Marilyn was first shown at Monash Gallery of Art (2002) and Nellie Castan Gallery (2006). In the early to mid 90s Papapetrou photographed Wrestlers and Body Builders at competition events. With an interest in circus life Papapetrou photographed at the Silvers and Ashtons circus in Melbourne in the early 90s. She also photographed drag queens at the then Trish's nightclub in North Melbourne and at the Annual Miss Alternative World Ball held at the San Remo Ball room, Melbourne. These early works were featured in the exhibition 'A Performative Paradox' at the Centre for Contemporary Photography Melbourne in 2013. Between 1995 and 2002, Papapetrou was interested in constructions of identity based on body and dress and explored this theme with images of drag queens and body builders. In Curated Bodies (1996), she reflected on the biological and social constructions of gender. Curated Bodies was shown at the Centre for Contemporary Photography, Melbourne (1996). In Body/Building (1997‚Äì2002) she reflected at how body builders were able to transform their body through diet and exercise. She placed images of body builders against images of neo- classical architecture to make the connection between Classical Greek notions of the ideal body and architecture. The photographs were run together to form a frieze that assumed the rhythms of an ancient Greek architectural frieze. Body/Building was exhibited at Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney (1997) and in the exhibition 'Fair Game' at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (2003). Work about childhood In 2002, Papapetrou began to explore the representation of childhood identity. Papapetrou has commented that in photographing children she is exploring the condition of childhood in its various guises. Viewing the children as shape-shifters, she's fascinated by their transformative process and how their identity develops, transforms through role-play and morphs as they grow. In the first body of work made with her then four-year daughter (Phantomwise in 2002), Olympia wore a series of masks that concealed her face from above the nose, but allowed her mouth and ears to be revealed. Papapetrou is interested in the transformative and performative function of the mask and how it can move both the subject and photograph from the 'real‚Äô to the 'imaginary‚Äô. Phantomwise has been exhibited as Olympia Masked Ballarat Fine Art Gallery (2002), Photographica Australis , Sala De Exposiciones Del Canal De Isabel II, Madrid, Spain (2002), National Gallery of Thailand, Bangkok (2003) and Singapore Art Museum, Singapore (2003). Papapetrou's series Dreamchild (2003) was based on the 19th century photographs of Charles Dodgson, more commonly known as Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She was drawn to re-staging Dodgson's photographs because his portrayal of dress up games ‚Äì the games that children play in everyday life and have often performed for the camera ‚Äì typified the boundary-crossing experience that occurs in photography. She photographed her daughter Olympia in a variety of dress ‚Äì Oriental, Middle Eastern, Victorian and other exotic costumes. Dreamchild was exhibited at Bendigo Art Gallery, Victoria (2003) Stills Gallery, Sydney (2004), Monash University Museum of Art, Melbourne (2004), Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney (2005) and 'Le Mois de la Photo‚Äô, 9th Montreal Photography Biennale, Montr√©al (2005). In the series Wonderland (2004), Papapetrou explored the psychological and physical presence in the fictive role that her daughter steps into. In staging the photographs for Wonderland, Papapetrou borrowed from the tradition of theatre and used scenic backdrops based on the illustrations that appeared in the original publication of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland made by Sir John Tenniel. Wonderland was at shown at Stills Gallery, Sydney (2004), 'Le Mois de la Photo‚Äô, 9th Montreal Photography Biennale, Montr√©al (2005), Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, New South Wales (2005), Monash University Gallery (2006), Te Tuhi Gallery, Manukau City, New Zealand (2007), Roger Williams Contemporary, Auckland (2007) and Warnambool Art Gallery (2008). In 2006, Papapetrou moved her work from the realm of fantasy into the natural world. For her it seemed an appropriate move as the children were growing older and their experience of the world was shifting from the imaginative interior world of dress-ups and make-believe into a more pragmatic experience with the world beyond the home. The series Haunted Country, (2006) was inspired by nineteenth century real and fictional accounts of children who went missing in the Australian bush. Papapetrou went to the sites of the most notorious disappearances where she staged and photographed scenes proposing what the physical and psychological circumstances may have been like for these lost and wandering children. Haunted Country was exhibited at Foley Gallery, New York (2006), Johnston Gallery, Perth (2006), Williams Contemporary, Auckland (2007), Nellie Castan Gallery, Melbourne (2007), The National Art Center, Tokyo (2008), the Museum of Photographic Arts, San Diego (2007), Aperture Foundation, New York (2007), De Cordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln, Massachusetts (2008) and the McClleland Gallery and Sculpture Park, Victoria (2008). Games of Consequence (2008) is based on Papapetrou's childhood memories of play, incidents that happened to her and feelings that she experienced growing up. Sensing that the process of growing up in the modern world had changed the exploration of personal individuality seemed a natural next step for her. By exploring her memories of play that occurred in places beyond the home, she wanted to reflect on the freedom that children of her generation enjoyed in these arcane spaces. The series was shown at the National Arts Center, Tokyo (2008), FotoFreo Fremantle Festival of Photography, Perth (2008), Foley Gallery, New York (2008) and Nellie Castan Gallery, Melbourne (2008). Following the Art Monthly Australia controversy, Papapetrou adopted the practice of covering her subject's faces. She wanted her photographs of children to move beyond the recognized identity of the subject so she could speak in a more universal way about childhood. By concealing the identity of the wearer with the mask it could expand the reading of the subject as a universal figure, the masked person representing no one in particular, yet anyone or everyone. Papapetrou has used the mask in her work Between Worlds, (2009), The Dreamkeepers (2012), The Ghillies (2013) and Lost Psyche (2014). The disguises, masks and outfits worn by the characters in these pictures change young bodies into old, children into animals or into anthropomorphic figures. Papapetrou exhibited Between Worlds and The Ghilies at Jenkins Johnson Gallery, New York. The Ghillies was featured in the 13th Dong Dong Gang International Photo Festival, South Korea (2014); the European Month of Photography, Athens and Berlin. In Lost Psyche (2014) Papapetrou evokes a lost past of symbolic roles that are at the end of their place in history. Using painted scenic backdrops, a practice she returns to after 10 years, masks, costumes and child actors, she weighs up the persistence of some historical conditions and the disappearance of others. The lost parts of the psyche are poetically reconstructed through metaphors of childhood ‚Äì which for adults is also a memory. In 2016 she created the series Eden completing a cycle of photographing her daughter and friends from childhood to adulthood. Exhibitions Papapetrou's work on childhood has been widely exhibited in major international photography festivals including: ‚ÄòPhotolux Festival of Photography‚Äô, Lucca (2017); ‚ÄòThe European Month of Photography‚Äô, Berlin (2016); ‚ÄòDaegu Photo Biennale, Korea‚Äô (2016); ‚ÄòThe European Month of Photography, Athens‚Äô (2016), the Dong Gang International Photo Festival, Yeongwol, South Korea (2014); ‚ÄòFotografica Bogota‚Äô, Colombia (2013); ‚ÄòPhotofestival Noorderlicht‚Äô, The Netherlands (2012); ‚Äò3rd Biennale Photoqua‚Äôi at Le mus√©e du quai Branly, Paris (2011); ‚ÄòThe Month of Photography, Bratislava (2010); Pingyao International Photography Festival, Pingyao, Shanxi, China (2010); ‚ÄòAthens Festival of Photography‚Äô (2010); Fotofreo, Fremantle Festival of Photography, Perth, (2008); ‚ÄòSeoul International Photography Festival‚Äô, Seoul (2008); ‚ÄòLe Mois de la Photo‚Äô, Montreal (2005). Controversy Papapetrou's photographs of her daughter have caused controversy. In January 2007 Gosford City Council closed the Australian Centre for Photography touring (ACP) exhibition Changeling: Childhood and the Uncanny at Gosford Regional Art Gallery a week early. A blurb, which gallery visitors were advised to read before making judgements, said the poses were \\"orchestrated by the child herself\\". In July 2008 Papapetrou's 2003 photograph of her daughter based on Charles Dodgson's photograph of Beatrice Hatch was featured on the July 2008 cover of Art Monthly Australia. Papapetrou came under fire from the then Australian Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd who said that he \\"couldn't stand this sort of stuff\\", referring to the photograph of the naked Olympia. Olympia commented in response that she was offended by what Kevin Rudd said about the picture. Illness and death Papapetrou was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. She recovered and was given the all- clear, but relapsed five years later. In late 2012, she was told she had just days to live, and moved back home to receive palliative care. She survived for more than five years, and died in April 2018, aged 57. Recognition Survey exhibitions of Papapetrou's work were shown at the Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney in 2011 (Tales from Elsewhere) and the Centre for Contemporary Photography Melbourne in 2013 in the exhibition, 'A Performative Paradox'.

The commentary explains what happened to Abraham when he was a young boy working in his father's idol shop. The story has been used as a way to discuss monotheism and faith in general. Characters=Abraham= Abraham is the first patriarch and is seen as the father of the four Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. The later life of Abraham is told in the book of Genesis Chapters 11-25. The missing years of Abraham's early childhood are explained through a series of Midrashim. =Terah= Terah is a Biblical figure from the book of Genesis. He is the father of three children including the Patriarch Abraham.Genesis 11:26 According to Jewish tradition, Terah was an idolater.Joshua 24:2 Terah also made and sold idols, as the Midrash Genesis Rabbah 38 explains. =Haran= Haran is the son of Terah, brother of Abraham, and the father of Lot.Genesis 11:27-32 Haran died in Ur of the Chaldees, in the presence of his father, Terah.Genesis 11:28 =Nimrod= Nimrod is a descendant of Noah and is considered to be a \\"mighty one on the earth.\\"Genesis 10:8 There is no description of a biblical interaction between Nimrod and Abraham. According to many Jewish and Islamic sources, the two did meet, and their meeting was symbolic of the confrontation between either: * good (Abraham) and evil (Nimrod) or * monotheism (Abraham) and polytheism (Nimrod) Basis of the Midrash The Midrash is based on Genesis 11:28, > ‚ÄúAnd Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his > nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.‚Äù The question the rabbis are trying to answer with the Midrash is why and how did Haran die in the presence of his father. Content of the Midrash According to Genesis Rabbah 38.13 R. Hiyya, a first generation Jewish sage, tells the following story: Abraham cast into the fire Terah was an idol manufacturer who once went away and left Abraham in charge of the store. A man walked in and wished to buy an idol. Abraham asked him how old he was and the man responded ‚Äú50 years old.‚Äù Abraham then said, ‚ÄúYou are 50 years old and would worship a day old statue!‚Äù At this point the man left, ashamed. Later, a woman walked into the store and wanted to make an offering to the idols. So Abraham took a stick, smashed the idols and placed the stick in the hand of the largest idol. When Terah returned, he asked Abraham what happened to all the idols. Abraham told him that a woman came in to make an offering to the idols. The idols argued about which one should eat the offering first, then the largest idol took the stick and smashed all the other idols. Terah responded by saying that they are only statues and have no knowledge. Whereupon Abraham responded by saying that you deny their knowledge, yet you worship them! At this point, Terah took Abraham to Nimrod. Nimrod proclaims to Abraham that we should worship fire. Abraham responds that water puts out fire. So Nimrod declares they worship water. Abraham responds that clouds hold water. So Nimrod declares they worship clouds. Abraham responds that wind pushes clouds. So Nimrod declares they worship wind. Abraham responds that people withstand wind. Nimrod becomes angry with Abraham and declares that Abraham shall be cast into the fire, and if Abraham is correct, i.e. that there is a real God, then that God will save him. Abraham is cast into the fire and is saved by God. Abraham‚Äôs brother Haran sees what happened and says that he believes in the God of Abraham. Haran is thrown into the fire, and is not saved by God. Hence the verse in Genesis 11:28, ‚ÄúAnd Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.‚ÄùGenesis Rabbah 38.13 The Midrash is not the only mention of this story‚Äîthe Quran discusses the story in great detail as well.Quran 21 Discussions relating to the Midrash There are several different ways in which this Midrash has been discussed. This Midrash can be interpreted as an example of persecution against those of monotheistic beliefs during a time when polytheism dominated. The Midrash has also been discussed in the contexts of complete, unquestioned faith. This comes from the idea that Abraham did not need proof of God before being cast into the fire, which is why God saved him. On the other hand, Haran needed to see that Abraham would be saved by God before believing, and because of this, Haran was not saved from the fire by God. The Midrash is also used by James Kugel, the chair of the Institute for the History of the Jewish Bible at Bar Ilan University in Israel, in his book The Bible As It Was, published in 1997 by Harvard University, to look at how stories from the Bible have been changed to how they are taught in the modern day. His analysis deals with how in modern times, Abraham came to be seen as the only monotheist. Kugel's interpretation continues in the tradition of looking at this midrash as part of the analysis of monotheism.

A weak lord of the Lagna (ascendant) and a weak Saturn jointly or severally cause suffering and hardships in life including being confined or imprisoned. Rahu is the karaka for being sent to jail. Mahadeva in his Jataka Tattva XI.35-42. states that Papa i.e. malefic, planets situated in the 12th, the 2nd, the 5th and the 12th indicate bandhana i.e. confinement. Equal number of planets situated in the 2nd and the 12th or in the 5th and the 9th or in the 6th and the 12th or in the 3rd and the 11th or in the 4th and 10th give rise to Bandhana yoga. Bandhana yoga also arises if at the time of birth malefic planets occupy the 2nd, the 5th, the 9th and the 12th house the Lagna falls in either Aries, Taurus or Sagittarius sign when the person will be bound by rope or cord, or in Gemini, Libra, Aries or Virgo sign when the person will be handcuffed or bound by iron chains, or in Pisces, Cancer or Capricorn when the person without being bound will be confined in a castle or fort or in a closely guarded prison or in Scorpio sign when the person will be confined in an underground cellar. Bandhana yoga is also caused if at the time of birth the lords of the Lagna and the 6th house occupy a kendra or a trikona in conjunction with Saturn. If benefics aspect the Bandhana yogas afore- detailed then the troubles are temporary but if malefics aspect then the person is likely to suffer very harsh treatment.Jaimini Sutras I.iii.42-3 The Lagna or the lord of the lagna and the Moon afflicted by a cruel malefic or malefics, the 4th house and its lord or the 9th house and its lord or the 10th house and its lord similarly afflicted make one commit evil deeds, become a criminal and suffer punishment at the hands of authorities. A person takes to a career of crime if at the time of birth Rahu afflicts the Moon and the lord of the 10th. Ketu situated in the 10th house makes one commit vile deeds and be impure in his resolves. In the case of Mahatma Gandhi born in Libra lagna, Saturn occupied the 2nd house in Scorpio sign and the Sun was in the 12th in Virgo as also Ketu was in the 4th and Rahu in the 10th for which reason he was frequently kept under house-arrest or in jails by the British authorities for political reasons. Similarly, Jawaharlal Nehru who was born in Cancer lagna had Saturn situated in the 2nd and Rahu in the 12th house who too suffered confinement like Gandhi. Ramkrishna Dalmia born in Gemini lagna had the Sun occupying the 3rd house and Rahu, the 11th; he went to jail punished for his mis-deeds and illegal activities. Aung San Suu Kyi born in Virgo lagna has Ketu occupying the 4th and the Sun conjoining with Saturn and Rahu in the 10th house, she has suffered a long period of confinement for her political beliefs. And, Sanjay Dutt born in Scorpio lagna not only has Saturn in the 2nd and Jupiter in the 12th but also has Ketu located in the 5th and the Sun in the 9th house. Mars situated in the 8th or in the 12th house if not associated with benefics leads to hospitalisation, living abroad or imprisonment. Mars, Rahu and Saturn, all three occupying the kendrasthanas indicate imprisonment. B V Raman states that Bandhana yoga is caused when the lords of the lagna and the 6th are in a trine or a quadrant in conjunction with Saturn, Rahu or Ketu. Mercury and/or Saturn situated in the 8th house from the lagna indicate death in a prison at the gallows.Jataka Tattva VIII.59 References Yogas ","title":"Bandhana yoga"},{"id":"38642652","text":"Ananda Dassanayake (April 16, 1920-August 9, 2012) was a Sri Lankan politician belonging to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

New Jersey Monthly, February 20, 2013.  Synopsis  Abby Ableman is a 42-year-old apartment flipper and interior designer with a routine domestic life and obligations. One afternoon, Abby's son Jake accidentally hits her on the head with a baseball and she is rushed to the emergency room by her wife, Kate, a divorce attorney. After being diagnosed with a concussion, Abby spends the next few days in a daze and begins to rethink her life. Kate falls asleep on Abby as they try to have sex. After an unsatisfying sexual encounter with a prostitute, Abby makes arrangements through her employee, Justin, to sleep with a young woman named Gretchen. The two women discuss how Gretchen uses this line of work to pay for college and that she loves having access to sexual encounters. Abby realizes that she also enjoys having access to new sexual encounters as they provide an escape from her monotonous life; she decides to take clients on a weekly basis. She meets with The Girl, Justin's business partner and new girlfriend, who agrees to send interested women to Abby in exchange for a small fee. Abby creates her alias, Eleanor, and meets with every potential client at a coffee shop as a precaution, only inviting them to her private loft to have sex if she deems them safe. Soon enough, Abby has sexual encounters with a wide variety of women, eventually becoming entangled with Sam Bennet, whom she recognizes from spin class. Like Abby, Sam finds herself in a nuclear family which includes a successful spouse (a husband in Sam's case), children, and plenty of money, yet feels an emptiness inside her. Abby's interest in Sam grows as she contemplates spending more time than just their sexual encounters together. Later, Abby attempts to have sex with Kate but comes off as too aggressive, leading Kate to call it off. Abby meets with Justin about which clients she wants to keep, prompting Justin to ask Abby if this is what she really wants to be doing with her life. Put off by this, Abby meets with The Girl at a coffee shop, where she cuts Justin out of the deal. After another sexual encounter, Abby misses picking up her kids from school, leading to a disagreement with Kate. Days later, Kate takes one of her divorce clients to tour the loft in the hopes of selling it. Abby acts disinterested as Justin pushes for the loft to be sold. The following night, Abby sees Sam with her husband Graham at the supermarket. She keeps her distance at first and observes how they seem to be a perfectly happy couple. Abby innocently introduces herself to Graham before making awkward conversation with Sam and leaving the store by herself. In time, Kate begins to suspect the encounters. She walks into the loft one day and finds a sleeping Abby, still naked from her most recent session. At home, Abby is on the phone with a client when Kate suddenly drives off. Abby chases after Kate but instead runs into Sam. Abby confronts Sam about their secret relationship, concluding that their sexual encounters were simply due to shared boredom. When Kate returns, Abby questions her wife why she never seems to want her. Kate confesses that she doesn't want anybody, including Abby. Abby sells the loft to Kate's recent divorce client and returns to her ordinary life with her wife and children. During spin class, she tells her friend Pru about all the maintenance she has to do on the house and on a new loft before the upcoming family trip to Argentina. When Pru asks her what she really wants, Abby echoes Sam and replies that she wants to take a hot yoga class.

Her work took penicillin from a laboratory experiment to a mass-produced drug during World War II.  Life and career  Hobby was born in the Washington Heights neighbourhood in New York City, one of two daughters of Theodore Y. Hobby and Flora R. Lounsbury. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931. She earned her and Ph.D. in bacteriology from Columbia University in 1935. She wrote her doctoral thesis on the medical uses of nonpathogenic organisms. Hobby worked for Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, during which time she collaborated with Dr. Karl Meyer, a biochemist, and Dr. Martin Henry Dawson, a clinician and associate professor of medicine, on determining diseases caused by hemolytic streptococci and later on refining penicillin. During this time, Hobby also worked for Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Hobby left Columbia University in 1944 to work for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in New York where she researched streptomycin and other antibiotics. In 1959, Hobby left Pfizer to specialize in chronic infectious diseases as chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, New Jersey. She also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College. In 1972 she founded the monthly publication, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, and continued to edit it for eight years. She retired from her main career in 1977. In retirement Hobby wrote over 200 articles, working as a consultant and freelance science writer. She also published a book, Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge, in 1985, in which she chronicled penicillin's journey and compared it to the Manhattan project in its importance to the war effort. Hobby died of a heart attack in 1993 at her home in a Pennsylvania retirement community.  Key contributions and impact Hobby is recognized for her work in creating a form of penicillin that was effective on human hosts. In 1940, Hobby and her colleagues, Dr. Karl Meyer and Dr. Martin Henry Dawson, wrote to Howard Florey and Ernst Chain to procure a sample of penicillin. They naively decided to make some penicillin and soon became experts in the fermentation process, and began refining it into a drug. Hobby, Meyer, and Dawson performed the first tests of penicillin on humans in 1940 and 1941, before presenting at the American Society for Clinical Investigation. They discovered that penicillin was a powerful germ-killer that reduced the severity of infectious diseases and made procedures such as organ transplantation and open-heart surgery possible. Their findings received media coverage, which helped attract funding from the United States Government to mass-produce penicillin during World War II, saving the lives of many soldiers. At Pfizer, Hobby did extensive early work on Terramycin and Viomycin, used for the treatment of tuberculosis.

The 'ham funeral' of the title is the feast to mourn the sudden death of Mrs Lusty's husband, held in Act 2.

Bahour also has reports of Lignite deposits but it is not exploited due to its close proximity to the sea and the likelihood of seepage of seawater, thus adulterating the ground water.https://frontline.thehindu.com/static/html/fl2905/stories/20120323290512400.htm It is a major access point for villages south of Puducherry and forms southern border to the Union territory. The city is also known as the ‚Äòrice bowl of Puducherry‚Äô due to the area being suitable for Paddy cultivation.https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/bahour-the-rice- bowl-turning-shaky-and-stale/article7026677.ece History The historical record of Bahour dates back to as early as the Chola Period. Bahour is home to an ancient temple- Sri Mulasthanam Udaiyar Temple, built around the 10th Century. The Earliest inscription on the walls of this temple are of Kannara Dev(Krishna III of Rashtrakuta Dynasty). Jouveau-Dubreuil considered this temple as one marking transition from the Pallava to Chola style of architecture.Vide Revue Historique de L‚ÄôInde Francaise, Vol VII, 1948 Evidence also exists of the presence of a centre for Sanskrit Studies- the Vidyasthana in the region which was known for imparting the Chaturdasa Vidya-fourteen branches of learning (i.e. the four Vedas, the six Vedangas, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Dharma Sastra and Puranas). The evidence of this centre can be found through the accounts of the Pallava King Nrpatungavarman(869-880 AD) which has mentions of grants of three villages as endowments to the Vidyasthana by the minister of the King.Balasubrahmanyam, C.R., Early Chola Temples. Orient Longman, 1971. The inscriptions of Rashtrukta King Krishna III also give an account of an elaborate system of village administration dating back to the tenth century. Inscriptions on the Mulasthanam temple give an account of an assembly, ‚ÄòThe Great Assembly of Vahur‚Äô which looked after village administration.Vijayavenugopal, G., Pondicherry Inscription Part II. Ecol\`e francaise d‚Äô Extreme-Orient. References to Bahour are also found as ‚ÄòVahour‚Äô and later as ‚ÄòSri Alagiya Chola Chaturvedimangalam‚Äô from the 25th year of Rajaraja I and onwards. Pre historic evidence of funeral urns excavated by archaeologist Kuppuswamy have also been found here,Kuppuswamy. Fernel Urns of Bahour. Pondicherry: Revue Historique de la Pondichery; 1974-75 making the territory an area of Pre-historic importance. Bahour Lake Bahour Lake is a major tourist spot in Bahour.

Indian Bird Conservation Network: Bombay Natural History Society and Birdlife International (UK).Pp.xviii+1133 the other being Ossudu Lake. ‚ÄòBahour Eri‚Äô or Bahour Lake in the Bahour Commune is the second largest and perhaps the oldest irrigation lake in the region. The lake was in existence since the Chola Period. Inscriptions of Kannaradev(Krishna III of Rashtrukta Dynasty) give an account of the lake as ‚ÄòPeria Eri‚Äô (the big lake) and also as Kadambu Eri (the lake surrounded by Kadambu Trees). Accounts of Rajaraja give a brief of how tax in form of paddy was collected for mainainance of the lake, failure of which would cost 25 Gold currencies and the task of digging up the lake to one who failed to pay the taxes. There are also accounts of a Council of Elders known as ‚ÄòEri Varya Perumakkal‚Äô whose responsibility was to look after the maintenance of lake and proper distribution of its water. Inscriptions of Chola King, Rajendra I mention how besides the tank task in form of paddy, every year, a pit measuring two rods by width and one rod by depth was to be dug by each member of the village aged between 10 and 80 years excepting untouchables. There are mentions of punishments in form of compensation even to the Lake Committee if they failed to collect taxes. =Historic Public Works at the Bahour Lake= Public works at the lake have been historically done by Devdasis. The Moolanathaswamy Temple displays numerous sculptures of Devdasis carved out of granite in various dancing postures. The plaque on the western side of the Ayi Mandapam Monument narrates how two Devdasi sisters- Bangari and Singari were responsible for the renewal of the lake. Bangari, to put an end to the dependency of the lake on rain water had taken up the task of building an irrigation canal which was excavated from Pennaiyar River to Bahour Lake and ran at the length of 13 km. Singari took up the task of renovating and desilting the lake. It was this initiative of the two sisters that had benefitted the whole of Bahour.Iswar, Clement.

It has seven department stores with its flagship store located on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen. The company is a subsidiary of the British department store retailer Debenhams. History Magasin du Nord on Kongens Nytorv in 1893 The company traces its roots back to 1868 when Theodor Wessel and Emil Vett opened a draper's shop in Aarhus under the name Emil Vett & Co. It was an immediate success and in 1871 moved to Immervad where the Aarhus store is still located. In 1870 the company opened a shop in Copenhagen in rented rooms in the mondain Hotel du Nord on Kongens Nytorv where Hans Christian Andersen had boarded from 1838 until 1847. The shop occupied an ever larger part of the hotel and the company adopted the name Magasin du Nord after it in 1879. In 1876 the two owners also founded a textile manufactury in N√∏rrebro, Vett, Wessel & Fiala, which later moved to √òsterbro where it also produced textiles for furniture. The factory has now been demolished. By 1889, Magasin du Nord had taken over the entire hotel. It was demolished in 1893 together with a neighbouring building and the current department store building was completed the following year in a French Renaissance Revival style to designs by the architects Henri Gl√¶sel and Albert Jensen. The executive architect was Olaus Mynster. The company opened branches throughout Denmark. In 1892, it had 50 stores all over the country and by 1906 the number had grown to 98. In 1911 the Th. Wessel & Vett branch followed in Malm√∂. The company was listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 1952 and the strategy was changed to having fewer, large department stores. Magasin du Nord took over its competitor Illum in 1991 but it was sold to Merrill Lynch in 2003. The company was controlled by Emil Vett's until the mid-1990s. To reduce its debts after a period with economic difficulties, the company chose to part with its buildings at Kongens Nytorv, in Lyngby and in Aalborg in a sale and lease back scheme. In 2004, Magasin du Nord was sold to an Icelandic consortium headed by Baugur Group. Baugur's bankruptcy in 2009 ceded Magasin du Nord to Straumur Investment Bank which subsequently entered into a joint venture with Pakistani businessman Alshair Fiyaz under the name Solstra Holding, which bought back what had previously been sold. Magasin du Nord was acquired by Debenhams in November 2009 while Solstra kept the 20% share of Illum and all properties. In May 2010, Fiyaz took full ownership of Solstra. In December 2010, he sold the properties in Lyngby, Aarhus and Odense to ATP and PensionDanmark for an estimated price of DKK 1.5 billion, keeping only the flagship building at Kongens Nytorv. Department stores Magasin du Nord, Copenhagen =Kongens NytorvOther branches= Magasin du Nord has three more stores in the Copenhagen area, located in the Field's shopping centre in √òrestad and in the suburbs of Lyngby and R√∏dovre. The chain further comprises branches in the cities of Odense, Aarhus and Aalborg. Museum On 2 February 2013, an exhibition about Magasin du Nord's history opened at the Kongens Nytorv store.

The battle resulted in a failure to Confederate forces trying to recapture the coastal town of New Bern which had been lost to the Union Army in 1862. Background Union forces had captured New Bern during Ambrose Burnside's North Carolina Expedition in March 1862 and had been under Union control ever since. In 1864 the Union garrison was a brigade-sized force commanded by Brig. Gen. Innis N. Palmer. Major General George E. Pickett commanded the Confederate ground forces coordinating against New Bern with a detachment of Confederate Marines and sailors led by Commander John T. Wood. Pickett organized a three-prong attack against the town. Battle Brigadier General Robert F. Hoke‚Äôs brigade first made contact on February 1 along Bachelor's Creek where he hoped to surprise the Union outpostChaitin p.92 under Col. Peter Claassen of the 132nd New York Infantry. Both sides brought forward artillery as the fight began to grow and Claassen ordered his men back into New Bern. In the darkness and fog Union reinforcements bound for the fighting became cut off and were captured. Hoke then halted his brigade outside New Bern and waited to hear from the rest of the Confederate attacks.Chaitin p.92 The second Confederate attack was led by Brig. Gen. Seth Barton which moved across the Trent River against the 17th Massachusetts Infantry under Col. Thomas I. C. Amory supported by the 3rd New York Light Artillery. Amory's artillery opened against Barton causing him to believe the Union defenses he faced were far too strong and withdrew from range of the artillery. Pickett's third attack was led by Col. James Dearing against Fort Anderson across the Neuse River. When Dearing came within sight of the fort, like Barton, he too believed the defenses facing him were too formidable to attack. By nightfall Palmer's Union defenses maintained their position and Pickett gave up hope of renewing the assault. On February 2 Commander Wood and his naval contingent surprised the crew of the USS Underwriter anchored in the Neuse River. The majority of the Underwriter‚Äôs crew escaped but Wood's Confederates seized the ship and set about to sail her downriver and attack the Union Navy Yard. Union artillery from Fort Stevenson opened fire on the Underwriter setting it on fire and forcing the recent captors to flee.Lloyd p.367 Pickett called off the offensive and retreated on February 4. Aftermath General Braxton Bragg, military advisor to Jefferson Davis, urged for a change in leadership. General Hoke would resume field command of the Confederate offensive against the Union-held North Carolina coast. Hoke would find greater success in his attack on Plymouth, North Carolina.

He is best known as a leading advocate of the Eight-hour work day. the effect would need to open jobs for more workers, and open new hours of leisure. Machinists' and Blacksmiths' Union Though little is known of Steward's early life, he became more involved with the labor movement while working twelve hours a day as a machinist's apprentice. He would go on to use this working experience as a means to garner sympathy and credibility in the movement while speaking at labor union meetings, taking part in strikes and publishing pamphlets. On the recommendation of Steward, the Machinists' and Blacksmiths' Union (to which he belonged) sent resolutions to the Boston Trades' Assembly, urging for a concentration on reduction of hours for working individuals. Not satisfied with the efforts of the Boston Trades' Assembly in approaching the issue, Steward joined several other former Machinists' and Blacksmiths' Union members in forming the Labor Reform Association, which in 1865 would be reconstituted into the Grand Eight Hour League of Massachusetts. Grand Eight Hour League Eight-hour leagues were established in cities all over the United States, with some politicians adopting a pro Eight-hour day stance and state-wide leagues forming in some cases. State laws for Eight-hour days were passed in several states including Illinois, New York and Connecticut, and city councils in Boston, Baltimore, Detroit and New York amongst others passed ordinances extending the eight-hour day to their employees. In 1868, government employees were granted the eight- hour day as a result of a law enacted by Congress. Enforcement of the laws, however, was ineffective at best. In many cases workers were faced with the choice of either accepting longer work hours or striking. In reaction to a shift of emphasis that he saw as detrimental to the cause (from working hours to monetary issues), Steward served on the arrangements committee of the short-lived New England Labor Reform League, which split into two separate movements. Seward said the greatest threat to overall prosperity was the poverty of workers, who competed with each other so as to lower the wage rate. The poverty of the many produced a state of stupefaction for the relentless toil primarily benefited the employers. Unity and struggle-- especially the strike-- was the tool but the goal was an eight hour day which would generate a revolution of rising expectations and ambitions, he argued.

He was one of the prominent Sanskrit writers of the twentieth century who wrote on both traditional and modern themes. He pioneered the use of several new genres in Sanskrit literature, writing radio plays, essays, travelogues, and short stories.Tripathi, Shastri and Pandey, eds. (2010), pp. iii‚Äìv. He wrote many songs in Sanskrit including Ghazals, Thumris, Dadras and Dhrupads. He pioneered the use of Prakrit (Braja and Hindi) metres in Sanskrit poetry. Life=Birth= Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri was born in Jaipur in the famous Devarshi family which had a tradition of great Sanskrit scholars and poets going back to more than four hundred years. His father's name was Devarshi Dwarkanath Bhatt, mother's name was Shrimati Janaki Devi and elder brother's name was Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, who himself was a Sanskrit scholar, proponent and commentator of Pushtimarg sect of 'pure non-dualism' (Shuddhadvaita). His ancestors were Tailanga Brahmins of the Gautama Gotra following the Krishna Yajurveda. The Devarshi family started with Baviji Dikshit, who migrated from Devarkonda or Devalpalli village (origin of their family name Devarshi) in current-day Andhra Pradesh to Varanasi during Mughal rule. The descendants of Baviji Dikshit later migrated from Varanasi to Prayag, then to Rewa (where they were given the Jagir of village named Divrikhiya) and then to Bundi. From Bundi, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh brought Kavikalanidhi Devarshi Shrikrishna Bhatt, a celebrated poet of Sanskrit and Braj-Bhasha, to his Jaipur-court and awarded him the title of \\"KavikalƒÅnidhi\\" (treasure of poetic expertise). Descendants of Shrikrishna Bhatt in the Devarshi family include Dwarkanath Bhatt, Jagdish Bhatt, Vasudev Bhatt, and Mandan Bhatt, who were all royal poets in the court of the Maharajas of Jaipur.Tripathi, Shastri and Pandey, eds. (2010), pp. xxix‚Äìxl. In this family, Mathuranath Shastri was born on 23 March 1889 in Jaipur. =Education= Mathuranath Shastri after acquiring basic knowledge of Urdu and Persian in the beginning, studied grammar and Sanskrit at the Maharaja's Sanskrit College in Jaipur. He topped in the grammar examination in 1903 and also in Upadhyaya examination for Sanskrit literature in the year 1906. In 1909, he passed the Acharya (Masters) examination in Sanskrit literature with highest marks. His teachers included Vidyavachaspati Pandit Madhusudan Ojha, Pandit Kashinath Shastri, Gopinath Nanglya, Laxminath Shastri, Haridutt Jha, and Shrikrishna Shastri. His contemporary Sanskrit scholar stalwarts were likes of Vedchoodamani Pandit Moti Lal Shastri, Mahamahopaadhyaya Pandit Giridhar Sharma Chaturvedi, Vyakaranmartand Pandit Lakshminath Shastri, Vaidya Lakshmiram Swami, Rajguru Pandit Chandradutt Ojha, Pt. Sooryanaarayan Sharma, Pandit Gopinath Kaviraj and Pandit Chandradhar Sharma Guleri. =Family life= Mathuranath Shastri married thrice. In 1909, he married Savitri Devi, daughter of the royal priest of Orchha, Raghunath Dauju. Savitri Devi gave birth to three children who all died in infancy. She also expired later. His second wife Mathura Devi, daughter of Narayanrao of Ajaigarh (Madhya Pradesh) died of plague within one year of their marriage. Although grossly reluctant to remarry, on the insistence of his relatives, he married Rama Devi daughter of Pandit Gopikrishna Goswami (of Mahapura, near Jaipur), a descendant of famous Tantrik scholar Shivanand Goswami, in 1922. From Rama Devi, he had four children ‚Äì two sons named Kala Nath and Kamla Nath, and two daughters named Jaya Goswami and Vijaya Tailong. His grandchildren are Hemant Shesh, Jayant Goswami, Devendranath Devarshi, Kalpana Goswami, Dhirendra Devarshi, Bhartendu Tailang, Neelima Sharma, Pranjal Sharma and Prachi Goswami. =Teaching= Appointed by the then Director of Education Shri Shyam Sunder Sharma, Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri taught Sanskrit from 1926 to 1931 at the Maharaja College in Jaipur, where other subjects besides English and humanities were also taught. From 1931 to 1934 he was the chief examiner/ Inspector of schools run by the Maharaja of Jaipur. From 1934 to 1942 he then taught at Jaipur's Maharaja Sanskrit College, besides serving as the Head of Department of Literature. During his teaching assignment, Pandit Bhatt wrote \\"Sanskrit- Subodhini\\" (in two volumes), a unique text book of its own kind to teach Sanskrit in an extremely simple and extraordinarily interesting way. Another text book \\"Sulabh Sanskritam\\" written by Pandit Bhatt was published in 1960. For many decades 'Sulabh Sanskritam' remained the main text book prescribed by the Government of Rajasthan for learning Sanskrit. Rightly considering it to be a nationalistic cause, Pandit Bhatt was a great supporter and propagator of Hindi since his student days. On his personal initiative, Jaipur was recognised as one of the centres of examination for various diploma/ degree courses of Prathmaa, Madhyamaa (Visharad) and Uttamaa (Sahityaratna) run by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. For this purpose he started special night classes in a city-temple, where he himself taught the students free of cost. Despite apprehension of attracting displeasure of the British officials, Pandit Bhatt and his team of dedicated teachers including Govind Rao Kaveeshwar, continued with conducting Hindi-teaching classes. =Death= Mathuranath Shastri died of a heart attack at the age of 75 on 4 June 1964 in Jaipur. His death was termed as an \\"irreparable loss to the world of Sanskrit literature\\" and was mourned by provincial and central governments in India, various Governors, and by Sanskrit periodicals and journals. Major works Mathuranath Shastri wrote many books, articles, essays and songs in Sanskrit, Hindi. He had started writing when he was just 14 years old and continued it until his death in 1964. His literature runs into more than one hundred thousand pages. =Sanskrit= * (1906) ƒÄdar≈õarama·πáƒ´ (‡§Ü‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§∞‡§Æ‡§£‡•Ä) published by 'Sanskrit Ratnakar'Tripathi, Shukla, Tripathi et al, eds.

Interpretatio christiana (Latin for Christian interpretation, also Christian reinterpretation) is adaptation of non- Christian elements of culture or historical facts to the worldview of Christianity.Eberlein, Johann Konrad (Munich). Interpretatio Christiana, Brill‚Äôs New Pauly The term is commonly applied to recasting of religious and cultural activities, beliefs and imageries of \\"pagan\\" peoples into a Christianized form as a strategy for Christianization.This strategy is not solely a feature of Christianity; the phenomenon was discussed in broader terms by F.W. Hasluck, Christianity and Islam under the Sultans (Oxford) 1929. From a Christian perspective, \\"pagan\\" refers to the various religious beliefs and practices of those who adhered to non-Abrahamic faiths, including within the Greco-Roman world the traditional public and domestic religion of ancient Rome, imperial cult, Hellenistic religion, the ancient Egyptian religion, Celtic and Germanic polytheism, initiation religions such as the Eleusinian Mysteries and Mithraism, the religions of the ancient Near East, and the religion of Carthage. Reformatting traditional religious and cultural activities and beliefs into a Christianized form was officially sanctioned; preserved in the Venerable Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum is a letter from Pope Gregory I to Mellitus, arguing that conversions were easier if people were allowed to retain the outward forms of their traditions while changing the object of their veneration to God, \\"to the end that, whilst some gratifications are outwardly permitted them, they may the more easily consent to the inward consolations of the grace of God\\".Bede, The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Digireads.com Publishing, Jan 1, 2004, p. 45 Practices=Reinterpretation of sacred sites= A menhir in Brittany topped with a cross Selective conservation of pagan sites: San Lorenzo in Miranda occupies the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, Rome, conserving the pronaos The Christianization of sites that had been pagan occurred both as a result of spontaneous conversions in early Christian times, and an important part of the strategy of Interpretatio Christiana.*MacMullen, Ramsay, Christianizing the Roman Empire, AD 100 ‚Äì 400 Yale University Press (paperback, 1986 ) The landscape itself was Christianized,Making Christian Landscapes , an archaeological research project through the Irish National Strategic Archaeological Research (INSTAR) Programme, 2009 (ref. no. 16716) as prominent features were rededicated to Christian saints, sometimes quite directly, as when the island of Oglasa in the Tyrrhenian Sea was christened Montecristo. Missionaries to the pagan nations enthusiastically turned pagan sites immediately over to church use. For example, Sulpicius Severus, in his Vita of Martin of Tours, a dedicated destroyer of temples and sacred trees, remarks \\"wherever he destroyed heathen temples, there he used immediately to build either churches or monasteries\\" (Vita, ch xiii), and when Benedict took possession of the site at Monte Cassino, he began by smashing the sculpture of Apollo and the altar that crowned the height. The letter from Pope Gregory I to Mellitus copied by Bede says in part: > ...that the temples of the idols in that nation ought not to be destroyed; > but let the idols that are in them be destroyed; let water be consecrated > and sprinkled in the said temples, let altars be erected, and relics placed > there. For if those temples are well built, it is requisite that they be > converted from the worship of devils to the service of the true God; that > the nation, seeing that their temples are not destroyed, may remove error > from their hearts, and knowing and adoring the true God, may the more freely > resort to the places to which they have been accustomed. =Reinterpretation of calendar and feasts= In the context of Christianization of Germanic tribes, Herbert Schutz notes that eventually old local gods were still \\"celebrated on their feast days, on their former sacred sites\\", replaced with some particular saints.The Germanic realms in pre- Carolingian Central Europe, Herbert Schutz, 2000, p. 156-157 The letter from Pope Gregory I to Mellitus copied by Bede continues thus: > ...And because they are used to slaughter many oxen in sacrifice to devils, > some solemnity must be given them in exchange for this, as that on the day > of the dedication, or the nativities of the holy martyrs, whose relics are > there deposited, they should build themselves huts of the boughs of trees > about those churches which have been turned to that use from being temples, > and celebrate the solemnity with religious feasting, and no more offer > animals to the Devil, but kill cattle and glorify God in their feast, and > return thanks to the Giver of all things for their abundance; to the end > that, whilst some outward gratifications are retained, they may the more > easily consent to the inward joys. However some scholars question the significance of the reinterpretation of pagan feasts. =Reuse of cultural artifacts= Cup of the Ptolemies; its pagan (Dionysian) motives ignored by the Church In the context of art, interpretatio christiana amounted to renaming (e.g., by added or changed inscription) or unnaming objects, as well as Christian allegorization of them. For example, a Roman cup or vase would be consecrated and used as a chalice in church. A notable example of the latter is the Cup of the Ptolemies. Unnaming could include deliberate omission of traditional pagan interpretations of the imagery in descriptions of artifacts, leading to their oblivion, whether intentionally or by ignorance.\\"Reuse Value. Spolia and Appropriation in Art and Architecture from Constantine to Sherrie Levine\\" edited by: Richard Brilliant, Dale Kinney, Farnham, Ashgate, 2011, , p. 109 in e-book; \\"Ancient Gems in Middle Ages\\" Crosses were inscribed on old architecture and its reused remnants (spolia). Liz James observes. \\"Inscribing a cross works similarly [to upsetting pagan statues], sealing the object for Christian purposes\\".Liz James, \\"'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople\\" Gesta 35.1 (1996:12-20) p. 16.(noting O. Hjort, \\"Augustus Christianus‚ÄîLivia Christiana: Sphragis and Roman portrait sculpture\\", in L. Ryden and J.O. Rosenqvist, Aspects of Late Antiquity and Early Byzantium (Transactions of the Swedish Institute in Istanbul, IV) 1993:93-112.) Martin Henig describes a number of personal intaglio seals with clearly pagan motifs, augmented with Christian inscriptions, such as \\"IESVS EST AMOR MEVS\\" (\\"Iesus est amor meus\\", \\"Jesus is my love\\").Martin Henig, \\"The Re-Use and Copying of Ancient Intaglios...\\" in: \\"Good impressions: image and authority in Medieval seals\\", British Museum Research Publication 168 , 2008 The Protestant Transylvanian Saxons acquired rugs from the Ottoman Empire, sometimes with Islamic motifs, and used them as prestigious decorations for their churches. Only their material value as a good of luxury, and their purely ornamental, non-figural design seems to have made these rugs appear as appropriate adornments of Protestant churches. A report about the great fire which had destroyed the Black Church of Bra»ôov in 1689 mentions the loss of a large rug which \\"according to legend was woven by St. Paul the Apostle (who was a rug weaver by profession)\\" It seems likely that the Christian owners of the rugs did not understand the original Islamic context, but created a new legendary context around these objects. =Reinterpretation of pre-Christian knowledge and lore= Pre-Christian sources and myths were subject to Christian reinterpretation during their transmission or placed in Christian settings. This presents difficulties for historical studies of the periods of conversion.Eric J. Sharpe, \\"Salvation, Germanic and Christian\\", in: Man and His Salvation: Studies in Memory of S. G. F. Brandon, 1974, A number of early Christian writers noted similarities between elements of Christianity and some pagan traditions, such as cult of Dionysus or Mithras, however in order to defend Christianity they insisted that these are plots of the devil to corrupt Christianity. Also, when translating pagan notions into a Christian worldview, pagan deities themselves were reinterpreted as demons.Richard Kieckhefer, \\"European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300‚Äì1500\\" e-book p. 58 An example is the Finnish name of the Devil, Perkele, probably derived from the Proto-Indo-European god of thunder Perkwunos. Though never a part of the doctrine or theology of any Christian group (and often attracting criticism), some rural Christian communities have continued to sacrifice animals (which are then consumed in a feast) as part of worship, especially at Easter. The animal may be brought into the church before being taken out again and killed. Some villages in Greece sacrifice animals to Orthodox saints in a practice known as kourbania. Sacrifice of a lamb, or less commonly a rooster, is a common practice in Armenian Church,Burkert, Walter (1972), Homo Necans, pp. 8-9, google books and the Tewahedo Church of Ethiopia and Eritrea. This tradition, called matagh, is believed to stem from pre- Christian pagan rituals. Additionally, some Mayans following a form of Folk Catholicism in Mexico today still sacrifice animals in conjunction with church practices, a ritual practiced in past religions before the arrival of the Spaniards. A thorough analysis of Christian reinterpretation of ancient learning was carried out by Herv√© Inglebert, with special attention to cosmography, geography, ethnography, and historiography.Herv√© Inglebert Interpretatio Christiana: Les mutations des savoirs (cosmographie, g√©ographie, ethnographie, histoire) dans l'Antiquit√© chr√©tienne (30-630 apr√®s J.C.), Collection des √âtudes Augustiennes Paris: Institute d'√âtudes Augustiniennes, 2001 Pp. 632 (review) Scholarship Humanistic studies of Antiquity and the Reformation combined in the 16th century to produce works of scholarship marked by an agenda that was occupied with identifying Roman Catholic practices with paganism, and identifying the emerging Protestant churches with a purgative \\"re-Christianization\\" of society. The Lutheran scholar Philip Melanchthon produced his Apologia Confessionis Augustanae (1530) detailing the rites derived from pagan practices. Heinrich Bullinger, De origine erroris libris duo (1539) detailed the pagan \\"origins of (Catholic) errors\\". Isaac Casaubon, De rebus sacris et ecclesiasticus exercitationes (1614) makes a third familiar example, where sound scholarship was somewhat compromised by sectarian pleading. Thus such pagan precedents for Christian practice have tended to be downplayed or even sometimes dismissed by Christian apologists as a form of Protestant Apologetics. The 20th century saw more purely historical inquiries, free of sectarian bias; an early historicist classic in this field of study was Jean Seznec's The Survival of the Pagan Gods: the mythological tradition and its place in Renaissance humanism and the arts..Jean Seznec *The La Survivance des dieux antiques, 1940 *English translation: The Survival of the Pagan Gods: Mythological Tradition in Renaissance Humanism and Art, 1953 See also *Interpretatio graeca, recasting of myths and traditions of other peoples in terms of the traditions of Ancient Greece, in an attempt to understand them *Inculturation *:Supernatural beings identified with Christian saints ReferencesFurther reading *Norberto Gramaccini, Mirabilia: das Nachleben antiker Statuen vor der Renaissance, 1996, *Erwin Panofsky, Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art, 1960 and later re- editions Christianity in the Middle Ages Christianization Christian terminology Christianity and religious syncretism ","title":"Interpretatio Christiana"},{"id":"38643512","text":"Illinois Route 179 (IL 179) was a state highway in LaSalle County, Illinois.

As of February 2020, there were 24 locations.  History  A view from Crazy Mocha The original store was the Dancing Goats coffee shop on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The shop had been named after the apocryphal legend of the dancing goat that heralded the beginning of coffee. It was purchased in 2000 by Ken Zeff, a merchandise buyer for J.C. Penney and native resident of Greenfield. As of 2003, the Crazy Mocha chain had growth to 3 locations. During 2004, the operation had doubled to 6 locations and 25 employees. The rapid pace of expansion raised questions among observers about whether the growth was sustainable. By 2008, the 21 locations required over 100 employees. In 2007, Zeff opened a store at PPG Place near to an existing Starbucks. The new location was to fill the void left by the closure of La Prima Espresso Company. Other downtown locations were developed to improve brand awareness. In 2009, the downtown flagship store was opened on Liberty Avenue in the Cultural District. In 2009, the expansion into Cranberry marked the first time the store had gone beyond City of Pittsburgh limits into the suburbs. That location was a direct challenge to nearby Starbucks locations had generated $1 million per year. Crazy Mocha was profiled by the Pittsburgh Business Times to highlight retail stores' issues with the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit. On March 14, 2018, Crazy Mocha was purchased by the Kiva Han Coffee Company, located in Cranberry Township, Pa. Kiva Han and Crazy Mocha now operate under the parent company of Ed's Beans, Inc., of which Ed Wethli is the owner. Business philosophy Each location has its own vibe, often themed along with the neighborhood. The Shadyside location matches the art-conscious neighborhood, South Side location has a faux-iron canopy hanging over the tables in honor of the area's industrial past, and the location at the SouthSide Works is based on a trendy Brooklyn cafe. The Bloomfield location teamed up with The Dreaming Ant, an independent video rental store. Crazy Mocha has been an early newcomer to urban rehabilitation in Lawrenceville and the North Side. The 2010 opening of the North Side location was hailed as the cornerstone of a redevelopment effort in that neighborhood.

The exceptions are Chiquititas Season Five, where the story takes place in a granary, and Chiquititas Sin Fin, in which the children have a different home. Rinc√≥n de Luz (literally \\"Corner Of Light\\") is also the title of a Chiquititas spin-of series that shares a similar plot, created by Cris Morena. The title Rinc√≥n de Luz replaced the previous one of Chiquititas, since Morena could not use the previous title due to copyright issues. Soon before its premiere, she stated that Chiquititas was \\"more than a title\\". The same name is used in the Chiquititas feature film. The manor is located at the Pasaje del Sauce, 829, in Buenos Aires. Story=Before the Corner= The original Rinc√≥n de Luz orphanage was idealized by Ramiro Mor√°n, in order to hide his new born granddaughter, whose mother, Gabriela, was too young and had the baby with a humble man. The baby grew up in the house, and became Mili, the first \\"orphan\\" to be sheltered by the place. She lived with Saverio, the adorable Chef of the Mor√°ns, and Ernestina, its rigorous janitor. The place then became home of seven other girls, who were actually orphans, and formed among themselves a family, they all guilded by Mili. The orphans periodically received the visit of Bel√©n, Saverio's endearing goddaughter who was studying to become a social assistant. They were also monitored by Emilia, the first woman to direct the orphanage, until she was fired by Carmen, an ambitious woman, and Ramiro's sister. She always managed to control his whole fortune, and wanted the own the house where Rinc√≥n de Luz was located. The house was also wanted by Ginette, Ramiro's ultimate (and several years younger) fianc√©e, whose father was supposedly its original owner. Through Ramiro, Ginette then replaced Emilia as the orphanage's administratrix, what prevented Bel√©n to accept Mart√≠n's proposal to occupy the position. Mart√≠n was Ramiro's son and Bel√©n's first romantic interest in the series, and the first one to offer her a position she would later assume. Ginette initially proved to be lovable to the chiquititas, but was later unmasked by Jimena, one of them. Bel√©n was then nominated the newest Rinc√≥n de Luz director by Ramiro himself, moments before his tragic death, and so she became. Her act would change the orphan's lives forever. =The Corner of Light= After Carmen managed to own the house, Bel√©n and the orphans were forced to leave their home, until a mysterious man, Pedro Vega, donated them a new one. Their newest house was a huge manor located at the corner of the Pasaje del Sauce street. The place then became the ultimate version of Rinc√≥n de Luz. The orphans discovered that some areas and artefacts inside the manor were actually magical, such as La Ventanita de Los Sue√±os (The Magic Window), that took place in the attic (Bel√©n's bedroom). Through the Window, the orphans could see their inner dreams and illusions becoming truer to life. The Window shared a similar function with a magic mirror, where the children could see their dreams if looking with only one eye. The manor also had some areas that could work as traps, and other hidden places. This new setting was introduced at the same time the story gained new overtones. The melodramatic plots were left as the number of adult characters was reduced, giving place to more children-centered plots. =The Granary= Years after Bel√©n and her chiquititas storyline ended, the Book of Life, in which she had written their story, was somehow found by Maria, a girl who lived in the streets with some other children. They later found a huge, picturesque granary, where Joaquin, a lonely old man, lived. His only company was an enormous tree, located in the middle of the granary, until the place then became the children's newest home. Following the Book's stories, Maria names it Rinc√≥n de Luz. An adorable woman called Ana arrived from the skies in a ballon, and gradually assumed Bel√©n's role in the life of the granary's orphans. She fell in love with Juan Maza, a widowed man who lived nearby the granary in his mansion, with his seven children, and Ana changed his life as well. The granary was burned down after they got married and left for honeymoon, by Juan's angry ex-fianc√©e P√≠a. She managed to send the orphans (alongside some of Juan's children, as well as her own daughter Tali) to a household where kids where treated as slaves, the Shadow orphanage. There, a shiny leaf felt right on Maria's hands, which Toya explained that the Tree was saying goodbye to them. Camila interpreted this as an advice for the chiquititas, to not lose their hope. P√≠a insanely burned down the granary, and died in her own fire. After escaping from the Shadow house, the children discovered that Ana and Juan died in an airplane crash, and that now they were left orphans, and homeless. =Back to the Corner= Fearing being sent back to the Shadow house, the remaining chiquititas stood homeless. Maria insistently kept the Book of Life, believing that to be the right moment to find the original Rinc√≥n de Luz described in the story. Following a magic star, they were then sent to the manor in the Corner, which was the very same from the past, except for its insides. The orphans discover a chimerical place full of toys, dolls and games, and through the Magic Window in the attic, they discover that they actually found their Rinc√≥n de Luz, as Bel√©n herself tells them in a vision. Somehow, the manor also became a gateway to a magical world inhabited by elves and fairies (where Maria befriends Tok the Elf). Also, in the library, the fairy tales come from their books to life. The reason the house was reformed is later clarified to the orphans through old documents found by them in a hidden office inside the manor. The house's owner, Rafael Sander, wanted it to be exclusively reformulated for his upcoming son. Unfornunately, his pregnant wife died in a car crash, and Sander was left in sorrow. His loyal valet Enzo tries to expel the orphans from the manor, stating that \\"it was an orphanage, now it's a private place\\". The kids stay insistent against Sander's bitterness. He hid himself in the manor's hidden places, lurking the children and a newcomer young woman named Luz, but was later discovered by Juanita. Luz became the newest maternal figure for the orphans, and later the orphanage's director, after it is legalized by the Juvenile Court. She had to struggle against Sander's angry and Paula's ambition to own the house she believes is hers. Paula was Sander's deceased wife's identical twin sister, who had always loved him, and still does, but in the end Luz and Sander get married, and he gives the manor to Luz as a gift. Due to the villainous acts of Lidia (a unscrupulous woman who assumed the house's administration in Luz and Rafael's absence), the manor was knocked down, leaving the children in desperation. However, the manor magically rebuilt itself for them, as the spirit of Bel√©n appeared in the skies. =In film= In the Chiquititas feature film, the name of \\"Rinc√≥n de Ni√±os Huerfanos\\" (\\"Corner for Orphans\\") is changed to \\"Rinc√≥n de Luz\\" after Bel√©n, Alejo and the children assume the house, becoming altogether a family. Other versions In the successful Brazilian adaptation of the story, the orphanage is named Raio de Luz (\\"Light Gleam\\"), and features adventure and fantasy stories unexplored in the original version, such as the children discovering a hidden treasure in the manor's surroundings. The manor was supposedly destroyed in the end of Season Four, and was set to return as a main setting in future seasons (which did not happen due to Chiquititas Brasil cancelation). Also, in this version, the Tree located in the middle of the granary is a gateway to a magical subterranean Wonderland-like world known as The Anthill. There, the orphans meet fantastic creatures, such as talking ants and flowers. No explanation about its origin is given, although Estrela tells the orphans that the Tree was there years before she was born. The granary was built around the Tree in order to protect it.

Mannadipattu, along with Nettapakkam Commune, forms the western border to the Union Territory. History Suttukeni had been active in trade with Rome via Arikamedu Port in 2nd century BCE. It is located 7 km from Mannadipattu. The Main Objective of Tribuvane Commune(renamed after Liberation as Mannadipet Commune) in the French Independence Movement When Puducherry was under the control of the French India Government, Tribuvane Commune (in English/Tamil: Thirubuvanai Commune/ ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ©‡Øà ‡Æï‡Øä‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡ÆØ‡ØÇ‡Æ©‡Øç) was one of the eight communes of Puducherry. After the conquest of Tribuvane Commune, the rules and decisions of the \\"Temporary Government\\", which had been formed by the revolutionary committee with the support of the people who had occupied the Commune after 06.04.1954, were not formally announced and communicated to the French India Government.The name 'Tribuvane Commune' came from all French records till 05.04.1954. Thus, the rules and decisions taken by the 'Temporary Government' after the capture of Tribuvane Commune after 06.04.1954 are not regulated by the French India Government. Therefore, in all French records, the term \\"Tribuvane Commune\\", the name changed to the name of the conquest and the ruler's name was not formally declared to the French Government. In the liberation struggle movement an interim Liberation Government set up after the conquest of the Tribuvane Commune by the Commune revolutionary party from the French Government has renamed it as the \\"Mannadipet Commune\\" after request of the public on 06.04.1954. Thus, from 06.04.1954 till today, the name \\"Tribuvane Commune\\" is called as \\"Mannadipet Commune\\".

This event can be engraved with golden letters in Puducherry history pages***. ''' The role of Tribuvane Communes' in the French independence movement is a unique one. The culmination of the anti-French struggle was decided by Narayanasamy S/o.

Accordingly, the decision was made by the revolutionary Communist Party to seize the police station. On 5th April, 1954 at around 11.00 PM, the police station was besieged by a heavily armed revolutionary group. On 06.04.1954 until early morning the next day at the police station in the crossfire, the French Guards and Police officers were chased. The French Police Station was brought under the full control of the revolutionary command of the trio led by S. Narayanasamy. The French flag flew over the Police Station was down and set on fire. The name board of the Police Station, which had been hanging in the front of the French police Station, was later demolished and then burned. Dawn on 6th April, 1954 the first Indian national Tri-colour flag was hoisted by the leader who led the revolutionary council S. Narayanasamy on the Tribuvane French Police Station. After the Police Station was seized and brought in their full control, more than a thousand guns, bullets and explosives were seized in the Armed Room of the Police station. This news spread to the villages around the Tribuvane police station, which was captured by the revolutionary group of three. (The French police station, captured by the three-armed action revolution, was demolished and in the same place new Police Station at Tribuvane was opened on 02nd June, 1984 and is currently working) Consequently, other volunteers from the Communist Party and the public, along with the revolutionary Communist party, escorted French officials from the French office across the district to go out of the Commune. After bringing the entire Commune under their full control, Narayanasamy announced that the revolutionary committee had been released the entire Commune freed from the French. Further, he arranged to put \\"dandora\\" (way of communication method used in villages to communicate messages) to the public that the revolutionary group was captured all over the areas of the Commune containing 22 villages and Tribuvane Commune was declared free from the French. On the orders of the revolutionary group leader, the French flag hoisted on French Government buildings were lowered and burnt down in the entire Commune.

Both schools are members of the Colonial Athletic Association. Through the 2019 season, the two teams have met 110 times on the football field, with New Hampshire currently holding a 57‚Äì45‚Äì8 edge in the all-time series. History The winner of each year's game gets possession of an \\"antique fowling\\" musket, named after former head coaches of the two programs; Fred Brice who coached at Maine (1921‚Äì1940) and Butch Cowell who coached at New Hampshire (1915‚Äì1936). The musket was \\"donated by Portland alumni of the two institutions\\", and was first awarded to the winner of the 1948 game (New Hampshire). It is a flintlock with a barrel in .65 caliber, made by Ebenezer Nutting of Falmouth, Maine, in the 1722‚Äì1745 era. Other than two seasons during World War II, when New Hampshire did not field a varsity team, the last year without a Maine‚ÄìNew Hampshire game was 1921. =Notable games= The Maine and New Hampshire football programs first met in 1903, when two games were played, both won by Maine. The 1919 contest ended in controversy, with confusion over whether a New Hampshire trick play in the final minute of the game was a touchdown or a touchback. Days later, a board of officials ruled the play a touchback, giving Maine a 7‚Äì3 win. In 1944, the teams met twice, with each team winning the game played on its home field. The 1944 Wildcats played a limited four-game schedule, with a roster consisting of 17-year-olds and returning veterans. The results of these two games are listed in Maine's media guide and College Football Data Warehouse, but have been absent from New Hampshire's media guide. The 1993 game had the largest margin of victory, 50 points, as New Hampshire won, 63‚Äì13. News reports around the 2012 game referred to it as the 100th meeting between the two programs. If the aforementioned 1944 games are included the all-time series, as is reflected in the below table, the 2012 game was actually the 102nd meeting between the teams. The only season to feature two games between the teams‚Äîother than 1903 and 1944 as mentioned above‚Äîwas 2013, with New Hampshire first winning the regular season contest, and then a rematch as part of the 2013 FCS playoff. Game results Note: The score of the first game between the teams, held on September 26, 1903, is listed as 18‚Äì0 in the New Hampshire football media guide, and in contemporary news reports of 1903; College Football Data Warehouse and the Maine football media guide list it as 10‚Äì0.

History This organism was first described in Brazil in 1910. This discovery was not confirmed until 2011 when experimental transmission of the organism showed its pathological capabilities. Description This parasite's normal life cycle involves wild canids and ticks. Domestic dogs are accidental hosts. It has been reported from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. This parasite is transmitted by ticks. After injection into the vertebrate host the parasite migrates to endothelial cells of the capillaries. The parasites lie within parasitophorous vacuoles that have a trilaminar membrane with villar protrusions. An apical complex is present which includes a polar ring and rhoptries but lacks a conoid. The parasites may also invade erythrocytes and leukocytes. Clinical features The disease caused by infection with this parasite is known as rangeliosis. In Brazil it is also known as nambi-uv√∫ (bleeding ears), peste de sangue (bleeding plague) and febre amarela dos c√£es (yellow fever of dogs). =Presentation= The clinical manifestations of this disease are anaemia, jaundice, fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, haematochezia and persistent bleeding from the nose, oral cavity and the tips, margins and outer surface of the pinnae.

A fire developed in the basket due to a leak in the balloon's gas fuel system, causing the balloon to deflate mid-air and crash to the ground. It was the deadliest ballooning accident in history and the deadliest aerostat disaster since the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, which killed 36 people. Background Hot air balloons are commonly used in Luxor to provide tourists with aerial views of the Nile River, the temple of Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, among other historical attractions. Concerns over passenger safety have been raised from time to time, with multiple crashes reported in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In April 2009, 16 people were hurt when a balloon crashed during a tour of Luxor. After the crash, flights were grounded for six months while safety measures were improved. Pilot training was increased and balloons were given a designated launching site. Following the toppling of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, the rule of law has largely been ignored. Sky Cruise, the operator of the balloon, had suffered a previous accident in October 2011, which even involved the same balloon. The company has stated that it is properly insured and prepared to compensate victims' families. Crash On 26 February at 07:00 Egypt Standard Time (05:00 UTC), an Ultramagic N-425 balloon,Ultramagic Balloons manuals (Archive) registration SU-283, operated by Sky Cruise departed on a sight-seeing flight carrying twenty passengers and a pilot. According to a nearby balloon pilot, Mohamed Youssef, a fire started in the Sky Cruise balloon a few meters off the ground as it was attempting to land, as a result of a leaking fuel line. As the fire engulfed the basket, the pilot and one passenger leaped to safety as the craft rose rapidly aided by a wind gust. As the balloon rose, approximately seven passengers jumped to their deaths to escape the fire. At an altitude of approximately , there was an explosion which could be heard several kilometers away. The balloon and remaining passengers plunged to the ground, killing everyone remaining on board. One eyewitness remarked that he heard \\"a huge bang. It was a frightening bang, even though it was several kilometers away\\" from his location. Youssef said it appeared that a gas leak in one of the balloon's tanks caused the fire and resulting explosion, consistent with information reported in state-run media. Earlier reports had indicated that the balloon may have contacted a power line. Two minutes later, the burning craft crashed into a sugar cane field west of Luxor. A second explosion was reported 15 seconds later. Ambulances arrived on the scene after 15 minutes. Bodies were scattered across the field when rescue workers arrived on the scene. The balloon's final moments were caught on amateur video. Casualties At the time of its ascent, the balloon carried 20 passengers and Momin Murad, the balloon's Egyptian pilot. Nineteen of the passengers were tourists: nine from Hong Kong, four from Japan, three from Britain, two from France, and one from Hungary; the 20th passenger was an Egyptian tour guide. Of the Hong Kongers, five were women and four were men. They were members of three families on a tour group organized by Kuoni Travel.

Retrieved on 2 March 2013. The accident killed 18 of the passengers on site; the pilot and two passengers survived the initial crash. The two surviving passengers, both British men, were rushed to hospital in critical condition. One of them died after five hours of surgery. Dr. Mohammad Abdullah, the head of the emergency ward of the Luxor hospital, said that the Briton who died in the hospital had probably suffered a fall. The surviving Briton was described as being in critical but stable condition, while the pilot was said to be conscious and talking, but with burns covering 70% of his body. Doctors at the Luxor International Hospital said that many of the dead suffered severe internal injuries and severe burns. Aftermath After news of the tragedy broke, Governor of Luxor Ezzat Saad banned hot air balloon flights in his jurisdiction until further notice. Egypt's civil aviation minister, Wael el-Maadawi, followed by suspending balloon flights nationwide. In a statement, President Mohamed Morsi expressed his \\"deepest condolences and sympathy for the families of those who lost their lives in this tragic incident.\\" National government spokesman Alaa Hadidi said a committee would be formed to investigate the accident. The bodies of the victims were transported to four hospitals in Cairo. Chinese consular officials in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Hong Kong Immigration Department officers were scheduled to travel with the family members of the Hong Kong victims to Cairo. Kuoni Travel, the Hong Kong travel agency that organized the tour attended by the Hong Kong passengers, made plans for the six tour members who did not take the balloon ride to leave Egypt. The tour agency stated that, in addition to the US$7000 per person stipulated by contract, additional compensation would be given. Mohammed Osman, head of the Luxor Tourism Chamber, accused civil aviation authorities of lowering standards prior to the accident. \\"I don't want to blame the revolution for everything, but the laxness started with the revolution,\\" he said. \\"These people are not doing their job, they are not checking the balloons and they just issue the licenses without inspection.\\" National authorities were quick to deny the allegations, noting that the balloon had recently been inspected. They also said the pilot should have shut off gas valves and attempted to put out the fire instead of bailing, and thus may have contributed to the tragedy. An anonymous civil aviation ministry official acknowledged to the press that standards had been weakened by the current regime. The pilot's license had been renewed one month prior to the accident. Local and foreign media analysts speculated that the crash would hurt Egypt's already weakened tourism industry, which was down 22% from 2010 levels. Wael Ibrahim, who oversees the tourism syndicate in Luxor, did not expect the accident to worsen the situation since tourism was already down so much. \\"This (type of) accident could happen anywhere in the world\\", he remarked. A local balloon operator, angered by the industry shutdown, remarked: \\"Why the mass punishment? Do you stop all flights when you have a plane crash? ... You will cut the livelihoods for nearly 3,000 human beings who live on this kind of tourism.\\" Angered by the industry-wide shutdown, tourism workers threatened to organize protests on 2 March. The same day, Saad admitted that pressure to resume balloon flights was mounting and promised that downtime would be less than a month. Hot air balloon rides at Luxor were set to resume in April, according to a statement on the Egyptian Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission's (CARC) website. Investigation Preliminary results of the government investigation ruled out criminal conduct as the cause of the crash. On 2 March, Luxor-area balloon pilots held a press conference to defend Egypt's safety protocol and their colleague's actions. The Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority released its final report of the crash on 7 January 2014. The 219-page report blamed a leak in a fuel line connected to the balloon's burner. The aging line had been in use since 2005 and sprung a leak, which ignited as the balloon came in to land. The fire severely injured the pilot, who jumped or fell from the basket. Some of the ground crew released the ground line in order to attend to the pilot, so that the remaining crew could not keep the balloon near the ground. The flaming balloon rose rapidly and uncontrolled, then exploded.

Mizrahi was a prolific filmmaker best known for making popular comedies and musicals. Between 1930 and 1946, he directed 30 Arabic-speaking films and four Greek speaking films, and he produced several films directed by other filmmakers. Early life Joseph Elie Mizrahi was born in Alexandria, Egypt to a Jewish family with Italian nationality. As a child he adopted the nickname, Togo, after Admiral Togo, commemorating Japan's victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. Career In 1929 Mizrahi established a studio in Alexandria, Egypt, and founded a production company, The Egyptian Films Company. He produced films in Alexandria until 1939, when he moved to Cairo. Over the course of his career, Mizrahi worked with many popular actors and musicians. He made a number of comedies starring Chalom (Leon Angel), Ali al-Kassar, and Fawzi al-Jazayirli. He directed five films starring singer Leila Mourad. His film, Sallama(1945), starring the Egyptian diva, Umm Kulthum, is thought to be her best performance on screen. He also worked with Youssef Wahbi, Amina Rizk, and Anwar Wagdi. Mizrahi directed actors Taheyya Kariokka and Ismail Yassine in their screen debuts.

Originating as an area of low pressure on 22 February well to the northwest of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the precursor to Rusty steadily developed within a favourable environment. Gradually decreasing surface pressures in the region signaled intensification and the low was classified as Tropical Cyclone Rusty on 23 February. Although a large, sprawling system, near-record high sea surface temperatures enabled Rusty to quickly deepen. Becoming essentially stationary on 25 February, the system acquired hurricane-force winds as its core improved in structure. The cyclone achieved its peak intensity two days later with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a barometric pressure of 944 hPa (mbar; 27.88 inHg). Thereafter, interaction with land caused its core to collapse before the system made landfall near Pardoo Station. Rusty weakened below cyclone strength on 28 February. Its remnants persisted over Western Australia for several more days before being absorbed into an extratropical cyclone on 5 March. Owing to the slow-moving nature of Rusty, a large swath of coastal Western Australia saw heavy rains from the storm with a storm peak of at De Grey Station. Substantial flooding took place accordingly; the De Grey River crested just shy of its all-time record at . Some structural damage took place, but the predominant effects of the storm were sustained by agriculture and infrastructure. Economic losses related to the storm exceeds A$500 million (US$510 million). The name Rusty was later retired, replaced with Riordan in 2016. Meteorological history In late February 2013, a monsoon trough combined with the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation to produce an area of low pressure on 22 February well to the northeast of the Kimberley region. Upon its formation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) began monitoring the system as Tropical Low 10U. Low to moderate upper-level wind shear and favorable diffluence supported tropical cyclogenesis as the system moved slowly south along the edge of a subtropical ridge. By 23 February, deep convective banding features were wrapping into a well-defined circulation. This prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300 UTC and subsequently initiate advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17S at 0000 UTC on 24 February. Surface pressures around the cyclone had significantly decreased by this time, with an automated weather station on Rowley Shoals, roughly 130 km (80 mi) southeast of the storm's centre, recording a 7 mbar (hPa; 0.21 inHg) drop to 993 hPa (mbar; 29.33 inHg) in 24 hours. The BoM similarly classified the system as a tropical cyclone hours later as gale-force winds were observed on Bedout Island. They consequently assigned it the name Rusty, at which time the cyclone was situated roughly north of Port Hedland, Western Australia. A large monsoonal cyclone, Rusty featured an expansive cloud mass with a relatively cloud-free centre spanning 160 km (100 mi). Under normal circumstances, cyclones of this nature tend to develop slowly due to their sprawling nature; however, near- record high sea surface temperatures of fueled an unusually quick organization. The high temperatures were linked to a record warm January across the entirety of Australia. Additionally the warmth extended to a great depth, resulting in a high tropical cyclone heat potential of 90 kJ/cm2. Throughout 24 February, convective bands steadily consolidated around the circulation as it intensified. The strongest winds continued to be displaced well to the south of the centre, however, within the most persistent convective band. This large, intense band extended westward from Broome to Port Hedland and into the western portion of Rusty's circulation. Areas within this band experienced gale-force winds despite being more than away from the cyclone. Increasingly rapid strengthening took place later in the day with a 35 km (25 mi) wide eye developing. Rusty became virtually stationary late on 25 February as a trough to its south weakened the ridge previously steering the cyclone south. Throughout 25 February, the storm's eye expanded to an asymmetrical 95 by 185 km (60 by 115 mi) diameter. By 1200 UTC, Rusty had intensified into a severe tropical cyclone ‚Äî a Category 3 or higher on the Australian cyclone intensity scale; this was supported by measurements of sustained at Rowley Shoals. The large circulation began contracting later that day and into 26 February. Intensification resumed later that day and into 27 February. Favorable outflow, enhanced by a mid-latitude trough to the south, allowed for deep convection to form around the eyewall. Rusty attained its peak strength early on 27 February with sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), with gusts up to 230 km/h (145 mph), and an estimated central pressure of 944 hPa (mbar; 27.91 inHg). The JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at this time to have been 185 km/h (115 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Shortly thereafter, the ridge over Australia began to rebuild and prompted Rusty to drift south-southeast. Interaction with the Australian mainland incited weakening of the cyclone. As it approached the Pilbara coastline, the eastern eyewall collapsed and its eye became increasingly cloud-filled. Bedout Island, which took a direct hit from the eyewall, only recorded sustained winds with gusts to . Around 0900 UTC on 27 February Rusty made landfall near Pardoo Station, roughly 110 km (70 mi) east of Port Hedland, with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). Once onshore, steady weakening ensued. Within six hours, the eye dissipated and deep convection diminished, becoming more confined to the southern side of the circulation. A combination of increasing shear and land interaction ultimately caused the storm to weaken below cyclone strength early on 28 February, at which time it was situated roughly southeast of Nullagine. The remnants continued southward over Western Australia, eventually opening up into a trough on 3 March. The system subsequently moved back over water that day before being absorbed by an approaching extratropical cyclone by 5 March. Preparations Satellite rainfall analysis from 21‚Äì28 February showing accumulations throughout Rusty's path. A storm maxima of approximately occurred offshore while onshore totals peaked at near Port Hedland. The Port of Port Hedland was shut down for 86 hours as the cyclone slowly moved by, causing significant disruptions to shipping. Twenty-six ships were evacuated from the port prior to the storm's arrival. Onshore mining was suspended for similar durations nearby. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto Group, and Fortescue Metals Group temporarily shut down or scaled back all operations in the area. The prolonged closure of the port resulted in a 2.4% drop in iron ore prices. Losses from lack of productivity and revenue associated with the port closures exceeds A$500 million (US$510 million). Coastal areas of Pilbara were placed on red alert on 26 February, meaning residents were on full lock down until the cyclone's passage. Approximately 500 people sought refuge in public shelters during the storm. As a preventative measure, a stretch of the Great Northern Highway between Port Hedland and Sandfire was shut down for several days. The road closures caused food and gas shortages in some areas; however, police eventually let trucks with supplies through the closed roads. As the remnants of Rusty moved south, flood warnings were raised across the Goldfields-Esperance region by 2 March and flood-prone roads were shut down. A local race was cancelled due to the storm in Esperance. Impact and aftermath A large algal bloom off the coast of Pilbara in March following Cyclone Rusty. Sediment run-off from heavy rains can also be seen along the coast. Owing to the slow movement of Rusty, many areas along coastal Pilbara experienced prolonged periods of gale-force winds and heavy rain. Sustained gales affected Port Hedland for a record-breaking 39 hours straight. Gusts reached on Bedout Island before the anemometer failed. Port Hedland International Airport recorded gusts up to . A large swath of Western Australia experienced heavy rains from the cyclone, with accumulations of at least stretching from northwestern areas of Kimberley to central areas of the state. A storm maxima rainfall of was measured at De Grey Station; however, an unofficial report of was received from Pardoo Station. Another report from Pardoo stated that the area received of rain in three days. Over five days, fell at the Anna Plains Station, accounting for 65% of its seasonal rainfall. Many farmers in Western Australia considered the rain to be beneficial as it caused little damage outside Pardoo. Farther south in the Goldfields-Esperance region, accumulations peaked at in Lorna Glen. Kalgoorlie experienced its wettest March day ever, with a 24‚Äëhour total of ; it was also on track to be the fourth wettest March on record in just two days. Major flooding took place along the De Grey River as it rose to , just short of the all-time record of set in 2000. Discharge also reached a tremendous 7,843 m3/s (276,973 ft3/2). Between 26 February and 2 March, an estimated 1.4 million megalitres (370 billion gallons) of water flowed the river. The effects of flooding from the river were mainly confined to Pardoo Station, where significant cattle loss took place. Many of the station's buildings were flooded and roughly of roads were washed away. The Nullagine, Oakover, and Coongan rivers rose above flood levels. Only minor damage took place in Port Hedland while some flooding took place in Kalgoorlie and Kambalda, with some homes damaged. Downed tree limbs and power lines in Port Hedland left 55 homes without power. Along the beach, a dolphin was washed ashore during the storm. It was brought to a tidal pool by Department of Environment and Conservation officers and cared for five hours before being released back into the ocean. The storm also weakened the seasonal monsoon trough over southern areas of the country in early March, triggering an intense heat wave across the region. Areas recently affected by the cyclone in Pilbara experienced temperatures up to , the highest temperatures in six years. Melbourne, Victoria, saw a record nine days of high temperatures above as the air mass moved east. Records in the city began in 1856. The city subsequently broke its record for continuous days with minimum temperatures of at least , reaching seven on 13 March. The Australian Energy Market Operator reported record electrical demands across the state of Victoria, with usage reaching more than 9,500 MW on 12 March. Owing to the prolonged heat, incidents requiring paramedics increased by 25 percent from the previous week. Immediately following Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30 personnel on standby and began aerial surveys to determine if residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned of the dangers of asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region. Later in 2013, Rusty was retired from the list names in the Australian Basin. During November 2014 the name Rubina was chosen to replace Rusty. However, Rubina was later withdrawn and replaced by Riordan in an update to the names in October 2016 See also *2012‚Äì13 Australian region cyclone season *Cyclone Lua ‚Äì A storm of similar intensity that struck the same regions a year prior *Cyclone Christine ‚Äì A storm of similar intensity that struck the same regions at the very end of the year References Notes General External links Rusty Cyclone Rusty Rusty 2013 Rusty 2013 Rusty 2013 Rusty ","title":"Cyclone Rusty"},{"id":"38643927","text":"Charles Kramer (1916 - March 23, 1988) was an American lawyer from New York City.

Cheeses from Holtsee are considered a speciality just as Holsteiner Katenschinken. Of course the proximity to the sea leads to the fact that fish does play a great role in the cuisine of Schleswig-Holstein and is featured in many dishes. Particularly typical are Maischollen, Heringe and Kieler Sprotte and carp dishes are traditionally served for New Year‚Äôs Eve. Famous desserts are vanilla ice cream served with Friesischer Bohnensuppe (a local liqueur). Especially in the rural and peasant cuisine many recipes were buried in oblivion since the mid of 20th century such as M√§dchenr√∂te (a dessert made of egg whites and cassis), F√∂rtchen (a kind of pastry), a precursor of the famous Berliner, Munkmarscher Muscheltopf (a seafood stew), Kalbfleischpudding or filled breast of pork, which is one of the many dishes with sweet and sugary side dishes. Sweet and tangy ingredients make the typical ‚Äöbroken s√∂√∂t‚Äò-taste of the cuisine of Schleswig-Holstein Taste characteristics One of the preferences of this regional cuisine is to combine the sweetness of a dish with a taste contrast like sour or salty. These combinations are also described as ‚ÄòBroken s√∂√∂t‚Äô which means ‚Äòbroken sweetness‚Äô in English and is especially present in dishes which are ‚Äòss√∂tsuur‚Äô (sweet-sour). Many typical dishes feature this ‚Äòbroken- s√∂√∂t-taste‚Äô due to their preparation such as Holsteiner Sauerfleisch or R√ºbenmalheur. This impression mainly emerges from the association of tangy meat dishes with sweet side dishes such as in the famous stew Birnen, Bohnen und Speck. In this stew the sweetness of pears is combined with the hearty and rich bacon broth. In some dishes this taste combination is accomplished by stewing meat for a long time together with vegetables and is then being served e.g. with caramelized potatoes or some sugar to add and adjust sweetness after the cooking process. Often the sweetness is also due to dried fruit such as plums or raisins which are not only used as a stuffing for poultry but can also be served as a side dish to grilled meats or fish or being featured in chicken or beef broth. Beverages Apart from the common drinks the cuisine of Schleswig-Holstein features many liqueurs such as Korn are popular to be drunk together with beer. This combination is also called ‚ÄòL√ºtt un L√ºtt‚Äô which literally means ‚Äòsmall and small‚Äô. The most famous beer brands have their origin in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein and are Flensburger Pilsener and Dithmarscher Pilsener. Hot drink specialities are particularly ‚ÄòTote Tante‚Äô (‚Äòdead aunt‚Äô), ‚ÄòPharis√§er‚Äô (‚Äòpharisee‚Äô, a coffee drink with rum) and ‚ÄòPunch‚Äô (a kind of glogg).

Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2000. He is largely credited alongside Syed Nazeer Husain with founding the revivalist Ahl-i Hadith movement, which became the dominant strain of Sunni Islam throughout the immediate region.Daniel W. Brown, Rethinking Tradition in Modern Islamic Thought: Vol. 5 of Cambridge Middle East Studies, pg. 27. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. Malik, pg. 72.M. Naeem Qureshi, Pan-Islam in British Indian Politics, pg. 458. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1999. Khan's controversial nature has led to contrasting assessments of his personality, having been described by contrasting sources as a radical fundamentalist, an underhanded and scheming politician and one of the first heroes of the Indian independence movement.Claudia Preckel, Wahhabi or National Hero? Siddiq Hasan Khan. International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World, vol. 11, #1, pg. 31.Annmarie Schimmel, Islam in the Indian Subcontinent, pg. 207. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1980. Life Khan's family were said to be descendants of Ali, the fourth Caliph of Rashidun Caliphate. Initially settling in Bukhara, they migrated to Multan and later to the Shi'ite strongholds of Bareilly and Kannauj. Khan himself was born in Bareilly on 14 October 1832.Shaharyar Khan, The Begums of Bhopal: A History of the Princely State of Bhopal, pg. 120. London: I.B. Tauris, 2000. Seema Alavi, Siddiq Hasan Khan (1832‚Äì90) and the Creation of a Muslim Cosmopolitanism in the 19th century. Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, vol. 54, #1, pg. 4. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2011. Khan grew up in a family which was impoverished despite its history of Islamic scholarship; his father converted from Shi'a Islam to Sunni Islam in the early 1800s. Religiously, he was initially influenced by the ideas of Syed Ahmad Barelvi. Khan received much of his education in Farukhabad, Kanpur and Delhi under the care of friends of his father, who died when Khan was only five years old.Khan, pg. 121.Alavi, pg. 5. After pursuing Islamic studies with two Yemeni clerics who had emigrated to Bhopal, Khan came under the influence of the works of prolific Yemeni author Muhammad ash-Shawkani. The reformist influence on Khan's thinking only increased with his performance of the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, whereby he became familiar with the works of Syrian polemicist Ibn Taymiyyah; Khan brought back a large amount of books with him upon returning to Bhopal and began writing commentaries. Khan relocated to Bhopal in 1854 initially selling perfume but later working as a schoolteacher, where his religious views gained him the ire of traditionalist locals. He was expelled to Tonk in 1857, but soon returned to Kannauj to protect his family during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.M. Khan, pg. 122. Khan took up a job as an archivist and state historian in 1859 under Shah Jahan, who at the time was notable as a woman in a Muslim principality who was heir apparent to the throne. For the first time in his life, Khan was financially well-off and brought his sister and mother to live with him in Bhopal. Khan married for the first time in 1860, to the daughter of the prime minister who was eleven years his senior. Siddiq Hasan Khan eventually married Begum on suggestion of his father-I-law (father of his first wife). Upon Shah Jahan's coronation in 1871, Khan was promoted to the position of chief secretary, began spending longer periods of time alone with Shah Jahan and the two were eventually married; with his second marriage, Khan had become the male consort of the female monarch.Alavi, pg. 6. According to Lepel Griffin, the marriage was in part to quash the rumor mongering, and officials made it clear that Khan was merely the Sultan's husband and would not function in any executive role.M. Khan, pg. 125. The marriage was controversial due to Indian beliefs regarding the remarriage of widows; ironically, the stated justification for support of the marriage by British officials - themselves predominantly Christians - was that Islam encourages widows to remarry. Despite remaining the spouse of the actual monarch, Khan's wife began to observe purdah and corresponded with male diplomats with Khan as her representative. Khan's mother-in-law held rather negative reviews of her daughter's new husband, and there was friction between the two families. Khan eventually fell out of favor with British authorities, unhappy with what was viewed as his strong influence on his wife's decisions. Both before and after his removal from the royal court by the British in 1885, Shah Jahan defended her husband to the very end as shown in the meeting minutes of a heated, vehement exchange between herself and Sir Griffin.M. Khan, pg. 141. For her part, Shah Jahan denied that her husband held any executive power and merely advised her on some issues, arguing that the claims of her husband controlling her were based on jealousy on the part of her son-in-law and personal problems between Khan and Lepel.Khan, pg. 148. In 1890, Khan fell extremely ill with hepatitis. Resident Francis Henvey, Griffin's replacement, dispatched a medical officer but refused to administer medicine for fear that, given the terminal nature of Khan's illness, the British would be accused of poisoning him. Khan died on 20 February 1890. Reception With the help of Yemeni Islamic scholars, Khan began criticizing folk Islam as well as the practices of both Sufism and Shi'a Islam. Khan banned celebrations for the Islamic prophet Muhammad's birthday as heretical practices without basis in Islam, something which upset Sufis greatly; additionally, his reformist ideas in regard to Islamic jurisprudence upset the predominant Hanafi school of Islamic law.Malik, pg. 76. Khan's humble beginnings and working-class background also caused him to become the object of scorn, condescension yet also jealousy on the part of Bhopal's gentry.Khan, pg. 127. Khan was still described as a prototypical Indo-Persian gentleman, multilingual, educated and with wide- reaching international ties. His efforts proved to be his undoing; just as quickly as he rose to become Bhopal's most influential Muslim leader, so did he lose this status. Initially, the British ignored accusations of his Muslim opponents that Khan was a proponent of Wahhabism, a label hated within both the British and Ottoman Empires due to Arabian challenges to the dominance of the two states in the Middle East. After reviewing a book of Khan's which contained passages about jihad and observing several students from Arabia attend lessons under Khan, the British relented and also accused him of puritanism and anti-colonial agitation in 1881. The British press at the time maligned Khan as a negative influence in the region, and pejoratively dubbed him as \\"the penniless adventurer.\\" Despite being accused of sedition against the state, Governor-General of India Lord Dufferin found no evidence of seditious acts on Khan's part at all after official inquiries.Malik, pg. 76. Khan even went so far as to write criticisms of Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab, who followed an entirely different school of Islamic law, in order to exonerate himself from the accusations of Wahhabism.Malik, pg. 76.Alavi, pg. 8. Among other details, Khan accused the Wahhabist of engaging in inter-religious violence and bloodshed and still clinging to the same traditionalist views for which Khan also criticized the Indian Sufis and Shi'ites. Additionally, Khan based his religious views on the internationalism borne by the networks created by colonialists themselves. The Wahhabist movement, on the other hand, was geographically specific to the anti-colonial struggle and cultural environment of the Middle East. Khan elaborated on his position that the Wahhabist movement had no relevance to the situation and experience of reform- minded Muslims in India:Alavi, pg. 9. ::\\"Those who worship one God object to being called Wahhabis in the Ibn Abdul-Wahhab kind of way not only due to his belonging to a different nation and all of its politics, but because they consider God as the ruler and the protector of the whole world and this univeralistic stance is blunted if they are said to be followers of a terrotorially rooted Abdul-Wahhab.\\" Despite his own defense and the efforts of his wife to protect him, Khan was deposed by the British in 1885 and spent the remaining five years of his life living in privacy. According to University of Erfurt professor Jamal Malik, the British overthrow of Khan was due to a number of political concerns rather than wrongdoing on Khan's own part. The start of the Mahdist War in Sudan in 1881 (which Khan ironically openly opposed), diplomatic ties between Khan's wife and the Sharif of Mecca and Khan's letter exchanges with Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II all caused the British authorities to fear a pan-Islamist uprising;Alavi, pg. 7. to withdraw the accusations against Khan, however baseless they were, would have weakened the British Empire's position in the wider Muslim world.Malik, pg. 77. Eventually, British officials admitted that they had overreacted based on rumors and intrigues among Bhopal's political elite and that Khan had been falsely accused; regardless, the Indian nationalist movement still regarded him as a hero in the anti-colonialist struggle. Upon Khan's death, his widow Shah Jahan negotiated with British authorities to have all of his official titles restored posthumously; Shah Jahan saw this as vindication of her belief that her husband had been falsely slandered, and filled her new court with Khan's relatives and associates.Khan, pg. 142. Outside politics Khan's efforts to preserve and revive Hadith studies, focusing on the statements and actions of Muhammad, were well received. Due to his large amount of edited and original published works, he has been dubbed \\"the Indian Al-Suyuti.\\"Mu·∏•ammad Is·∏•ƒÅq, India's contribution to the study of Hadith literature, pg. 175. University of Dhaka, 1955. Legacy=Views= Khan's theological views were very much a product of Shah Waliullah's reformist school in India.Schimmel, pg. 208. Coupled with the reformist ideas of Shaukani and Ibn Taymiyyah, Khan and his Ahl al-Hadith movement established similar iconoclastic ideas to the mainstream at the time. Not surprisingly given the fate of his ideological predecessors, much of Khan's philosophy was based as a reaction against the prevailing religious climate; Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the Deobandi and Barelvi movements and the Shi'ites from which Khan himself was descended were all targets of Khan's reformist criticism. Khan's religious views have been described as centering on a desire to return to the pristine values with which Islam originally came, and to rid the Muslim world of the ills of charlatans, frauds and Hindu influence on Muslim practice. =Works= After his marriage to the Sultan, Khan began publishing his own original works in Arabic, Persian and Urdu; the number of his works eventually topped 200, and many of them were distributed by the state press for free in Bhopal's schools.Malik, pg. 75. His polemical and theological works are generally underlain by the principles of self-judgment, reason and rationality. Khan has been noted as one of the first scholars to research the topic of lexicography of the Arabic language, a field of study which the Arabs themselves had ignored until recently.John A. Haywood, Arabic Lexicography, pg. 1. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1965.John A. Haywood, \\"An Indian Contribution to the Study of Arabic Lexicography.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, October 1956, pgs. 165-180.

Chandrayogadhyaya sloka 5. This yoga has also been cited by Varahamihira as arising from the Moon alone. B. Suryanarain Rao, concurring with others states that this definition of Adhi yoga indicates that all benefics must be in these houses or in any one of these houses i.e. in 6th, 7th and 8th, or in 6th or in 7th or in 8th, or in 6th and 7th or 6th and 8th or in 7th and 8th. He also cites the opinion of Srutakriti who states that malefic planets occupying these bhavas will also give rise to Adhi yoga but the person will be evil minded and tyrannical; if benefics and malefic are thus placed then mixed results will ensue. Mandavya and Saravali class Adhi yoga as Raja yoga. Mantreswara in his Phaladeepika declares that Adhiyoga will arise even when the three natural benefics happen to occupy the 6th, the 7th and the 8th bhavas counted from the Lagna (Birth ascendant). However, Mahadeva does not seem to agree and reproduces in his Jataka Tattva Parashara's description of Adhi yoga. B V Raman reproducing Parashara's description of Adhi yoga states that the person will be polite and trustworthy, will have an enjoyable and happy life, surrounded by luxuries and affluence, will inflict defeats on his enemies, will be healthy and will live long. While citing the opinion expressed by Varahmihira to the effect that only natural benefics should occupy these houses he clarifies that one natural benefic planet in any one of the stated bhavas from the Moon will make one a leader, two planets will make one a minister and three planets will make one hold an eminent position in life but if these benefics be devoid of strength then the prescribed influence of this yoga will not be there. Bill Gates was born with Adhi yoga. In his case, the Moon situated alone in Pisces sign has Jupiter in Leo in the 6th, Mercury conjoining with Mars in Virgo in the 7th, and Venus is in the 8th with the Sun and Saturn in Libra, this location of benefic and malefic planets gives rise to other important yogas. There is the opinion that influence of malefics may not spoil this yoga, they bring in aggression, ruthlessness and power and stand for technical education and scientific professions. The view that a single natural benefic in the 6th or in the 7th or in the 8th from the Moon gives rise to Adhi yoga appears to be too far-fetched for it is seen that single Jupiter either in the 6th or in the 8th gives rise to the inauspicious Sakat yoga and if it is alone in the 7th to the favourable Gajakesari yoga. Adhi yoga can be seen present with other yogas and Raja yogas.

Ghulam Mohiuddin also made a special appearance. Chambaili is a political drama exploring the subject of political corruption. Since the flower 'Chambaili' (lily flower) is the national flower of Pakistan, the film-makers' intentions were to encourage patriotism and nationalism in Pakistan and they obviously picked this name for a reason., Retrieved 15 July 2016 Plot The film is a story of a group of friends and their courage, romance and sacrifice at a fateful time. It is set in the fictional city of 'Falakabad' in the country of 'Mulke Khudadad'. In Falakabad, the story revolves around Yaadgaar Colony (an historical district dating to the pre-partition period before 1947). Mulke Khudadad drifts towards anarchy, civil strife and a dark age. Political parties, leaders and lobbies pursue their own agendas. Corruption is at a record high, law and order have deteriorated. Inflation and unemployment are rampant, and intolerance is the order of the day. Deprivation and desperation set the stage for dissent. Confusion and chaos are voiced in the mainstream media, leading to disillusionment. The people wage a daily war for survival, with no time for ideas for the common good of the people. A group of friends are led by circumstances to try to change the future of the country. They form a political party (Chambaili Tehreek) despite their lack of experience, resources or political background in politics, but their efforts seem doomed. Faced with threats, arrest, cynicism and rejection, electoral reforms give them the impetus to continue. Under the new electoral system, 'Chambaili Tehreek' wins by a wide margin and its elected president gives his \\"Freedom Speech\\".

At its release, the film surpassed Bollywood's Ashaqui 2 and Hollywood's Oblivion at the Pakistani box office. It was discussed in the national media, and has been praised for its contribution to democracy in Pakistan. Chambaili has been credited with galvanizing non-voters and youth to vote in the 2013 Pakistani general elections, which had a large turnout.

Biography  He was born into a wealthy family. He showed little ability for practical pursuits, but his mother was a good friend of Jozef Isra√´ls and was able to obtain him positions in the workshops of some well-known lithographers, notably Petrus Franciscus Greive.Profile @ the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie. After Greive's death in 1872, he studied with his nephew, Johan Conrad Greive, then set himself up as an independent painter in Eemnes, where he often worked en plein aire. He sometimes painted interiors without figures, to avoid the cost of models.Brief biography @ the De Valk Lexicon kunstenaars Laren-Blaricum. In 1878, he took a course at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp with Charles Verlat. He then settled in Blaricum, but kept a small apartment in Oosterpark, where he spent the winters. Except for short periods in Nunspeet and Brabant, he travelled little. In 1887, he was married and bought a house in Laren, near the \\"Villa Ariette\\" of Anton Mauve, who he greatly admired. When Mauve came to visit, he would often hide what he was working on, claiming that it had already been sold and shipped, because he was afraid that Mauve would not like it. He is considered to be a member of the Laren School. Although mostly known for simple, peasant interiors, he also did landscapes and portraits. His canvases brightened up later in life, when he appears to have become more confident of success. A street in Laren is named after him.

Bach, though on a somewhat smaller scale, and belongs, together with Gottfried Kirchhoff and Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow to the group of composers of the so-called Hallischen Sp√§tbarock. His father was the schoolhead and organist Daniel Ziegler (born 1630), son of the Saxon schoolteacher Johann Ziegler. Life Ziegler had already caused a stir as a child prodigy at the Dresdener court of August the Strong, as his contemporary Johann Gottfried Walther, a distant cousin of Bach, wrote in his Musicalischem Lexicon that he could sing at the age four, play the keyboard a couple of years later, and as a 10-year-old play the organ at religious services. Gotthilf became a pupil of Christian Petzold, organist of the Sophienkirche. He also studied three years in the Collegium musicum des Paedagogium regium of August Francke, in Halle, where he also studied law and theology for 3 years. In 1710 he became a pupil of Friedrich Zachow (who was also the teacher of Johann Philipp Krieger and none other than George Frideric H√§ndel. In 1715 Gotthilf also took lessons with Johann Sebastian Bach, especially in the art of choral music. In 1714 he became assistant of the organist A. Meissner in the Ullrichskirche in Halle. Four years later he succeeded Meissner as organist and Director musicis until his own death in 1747. He also acted as Bach's agent in the sale of various musical printings. Ziegler was married to Anna Elisabeth Kr√ºger, with whom he had 5 children.

With this method he was able to show that electrochemical reaction analysis is possible even under ultrathin electrolytic films and non-conducting coatings. With the help of the Kelvin probe, Stratmann was able to explain the atmospheric corrosion of iron and iron based alloys, and the de-adhesion of polymer coatings of reactive metallic surfaces. With the insight that the formation of electrochemical elements and especially the reduction of molecular oxygen is the key factor to understand the stability of metal-polymer bonds, Stratmann and his team developed new interface-chemical concepts to increase the stability of these bonds which finally lead to self-healing processes of defect interfaces. These concepts were also transferred into industrial applications.

It was found in 1982 in the Allan Hills at the end of the Transantarctic Mountains, during a meteorite gathering expedition (ANSMET). Discovery and naming ALH A81005 was found on 17 January 1982 by John Schutt and Ian Whillans. It is named after the Allan Hills, a mountain chain in Antarctica where many meteorites are gathered by expeditions. The large number of meteorites collected in Antarctica and the lack of geographic terms that could be used for names have led to the adaption of the \\"Antarctic rules\\" for meteorite naming. Every meteorite found in Antarctica receives the names of the collection area (Allan Hills) and a number. The number consists of the year the expedition started \\"81\\" and a three digit number that is given out consecutively (005). The \\"A\\" in front of the number stands for meteorites collected by ANSMET expeditions and can be considered optional. The definition of the year is used because the year changes during the Austral summer season (December to March) and this avoids samples from one expedition having different years. This is the reason ALH A81005 has the year \\"81\\" in its name despite being found on 17 January 1982. Description ALH A81005 measures . It has a dark fusion crust on the outside. The interior is made up of a black to dark grey groundmass (matrix) with larger grey and white angular crystals (clasts). This appearance is typical for breccias, including those originating on Earth. The size of the larger crystals ranges from sub-millimeter to in diameter. Thin section analysis revealed that the crystals are mostly plagioclase, with some pyroxene and olivine. It was also discovered that the meteorite had similarities to terrestrial gabbro or basalt. Microprobe analysis showed that the plagioclase was very calcium-rich. The crystals are a solid solution of 97% anorthite and 3% albite. The pyroxenes have a variable composition lying between enstatite, ferrosilite and wollastonite. The olivine is a solid solution of 11 to 40% fayalite with the rest being forsterite. ALH A81005 is classified as a \\"lunar anorthosite breccia\\" and belongs to the group \\"lunar anorthosite\\" (abbreviated Lun-A).  History  The determination that ALH A81005 was of lunar origin was made by Robert Clayton and Toshiko Mayeda, researchers at the University of Chicago, following the determination by Smithsonian Institution scientist Brian Harold Mason that the meteorite was similar in chemical and isotopic composition to rocks returned by the Apollo program astronauts from lunar highland areas. Evidence that ALHA 81005 is a lunar sample, was presented at the 18 March 1983 meeting of the Lunar and Planetary Institute. The evidence included fabric data, mineralogical data, compositional data, Oxygen isotope data, Noble gas data, Cosmic ray exposure history, magnetic properties, nuclear particle tracks, and thermoluminescence data.

He was accused of the murder of two boys in Montigny-l√®s-Metz, in Moselle on 30 April 1987, at the age of 16. On 27 January 1989, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder. On 24 April 2002 after spending 15 years in prison, he was exonerated. The French government gave him one million euros (of which 700,000 euros in compensation) for judicial mistake. This is one of the most serious judicial mistakes recognised in France and it's the first one concerning a minor sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Case On 28 September 1986, two children, Cyril Beining (b. 1978), and Alexandre Beckrich, were found dead alongside a SNCF track in Montigny-l√®s-Metz. Patrick Dils, who was 16 years old at the time and a trainee cook, was questioned because he was living in the same street as the victims and he was denounced by an anonymous call. His timetable did not match with the hour of the murder indicated by the coroner so he was released. On 28 April 1987, following a new testimony which reconsidered the time of death indicated by the coroner, he was taken in for questioning after finishing his shift at a restaurant in Montigny-l√®s-Metz. After 36 hours in custody and police interrogation which lasted a few days, he admitted the murders and stated that he didn't know the reasons for the crimes. On 30 April 1987, he was charged with voluntary homicides and sent to the prison of Metz- Queuleu. He gave a different version to his attorney but the investigating judge organized a reconstruction on 7 May during which he continued to admit the crime. Moreover, he recognised the rocks which served for the crime. This fact convinced the judge of his guilt. According to his parents, he didn't realise the importance of the procedure. On the 30 May 1987, he wrote to his attorney to modify his declarations. Investigation Seven months passed between the murder and Dils arrest. Dils parents described Bernard Varlet, who was Inspector of Judicial Police of Metz and in charge of the investigation, as very aggressive and relentless against Dils. Varlet had already obtained confessions from two other suspects, but these were rejected. Throughout the investigation investigators obtained confessions from three different people, all single, living with their parents and having a low level of education. The first suspect who confessed was Mr. L., on 10 December 1986, who worked one hundred meters from the scene of the murder. According to the report of the hearing, he accurately described the bike and children's clothing. Police doubted his confession after he failed to climb up a slope at the crime scene during a reconstruction. On 12 February 1987, investigators arrested a new suspect for \\"outraging public decency.\\" After confessing, he was eventually also exonerated because of inconsistencies in his testimony. Dils was the last remaining suspect investigators had. They believed he was guilty despite the inconsistencies that remained around the timeline of the murder, and the difficulty that a teenager may have had in causing the extreme physical violence acts perpetrated on the victims. The judge at the time, Ms. Mireille Maubert, appeared to have the same view as the investigators. When Dils parents requested a permit to visit their son, she told them they would never see him. For sixteen months she refused to grant a permit. Sentencing On 27 January 1989, he was sentenced to life sentences for murder by the juvenile Cour d'assises of Moselle. They didn't take into account that he was a minor, however, the excuse of minority which was constantly presented to the jury would have permitted to halve the sentence (for the current law but at this time, being a minor would have only reduced the sentence to a maximum of 25 years). For the first time since April 1987, his parents were allowed to see him for 5 minutes in a corridor controlled by policemen. Victims' parents said that they would have preferred the death penalty for Patrick Dils (abolished in France for minors in 1980 and then fully in 1981). Appeals Dils' lawyers filed the first request for review with the Court of Cassation on 26 July 1990. The request was rejected. On 6 May 1994, Dils requested a presidential pardon from Fran√ßois Mitterrand, who refused him. Mitterrand wrote to the victim's family and assured them that he would never grant clemency to a murderer of children. New facts Chief Warrant Officer gendarmerie, Jean-Fran√ßois Abgrall, from the research section of the gendarmerie Rennes, was a specialist in cases where the serial killer Francis Heaulme was convicted, indicted or a suspect. On 24 October 1997, he sent a legal document detailing a conversation he had considered during the 1992 arrest of Heaulme in Brest. In the minutes, Abgrall wrote: \\"Francis Heaulme kept us the following statement, saying he had done a bike ride along a railroad track in eastern France, have been stones thrown by two children, leaving, then passing by the scene a few minutes later, when he saw the bodies of two children near cars and garbage near a bridge, seeing the scene of firefighters and police officers.\\" Abgrall immediately conducted research on any unsolved crimes involving two children. There was no trace of a double murder because at that time (1992), Patrick Dils had already been convicted and the double murder had been removed from the database. In 1998, Dils' parents, who still believed their son was innocent, asked two lawyers, Parisian masters Jean-Marc Florand and Karim Achoui, to reconsider the case. Interested in Francis Heaulme, they sent a letter to the gendarmerie in Rennes. Abgrall decided to write the minutes of the legal information, and on 27 March 1998, Florand filed a new petition for review after learning that the serial killer Francis Heaulme was near the scene of the crime at the time it took place. Court of Cassation magistrate, Jean Favard, began his investigation from a record of criminal intelligence. He visited Francis Heaulme and obtained new details about his schedule on 29 September 1986, the day of the double murder. At the time of the murder Heaulme worked in a business located 400 metres from the crime scene. He acknowledged having been on site at the day, the time and exact location of the crimes, seeing the children having stones thrown on their heads by the two children, but denied carrying out the double murder. However, his presence is a \\"new fact likely to raise doubts about the guilt of the condemned.\\" The counselor rapporteur of the Committee on Revision published two reports dated 30 June 1998 and 16 July 1998. On 21 June 1999, the board of review of criminal convictions, chaired by Henri Le Gall, found that the evidence adduced was totally unknown to the file of the Court of Assizes of minors in 1989 and can only cast doubt on Patrick Dils' guilt. He agreed to submit the file to the Dils Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court sitting as a Court of Revision. It concluded that it should order further investigations and conduct further hearings of witnesses already heard in 1986 and 1989, but by comparing the statements of Francis Heaulme. Acquittal On 21 April 2001, the Court of Revision quashed Dils' conviction but refused to release him pending a retrial. On 20 June 2001 a new trial opened before the Assize Court of the minor Marne. Francis Heaulme appeared as a witness, but he refused to take responsibility for the double murder, despite the suspicions against him. On 29 June 2001, the court sentenced Dils to twenty-five years imprisonment, to everyone's surprise. The journalists had already prepared their articles announcing his acquittal, at the time the Advocate General had expressed his personal belief: according to him, Dils could not be the culprit, he would not have had time to commit the crime. Convicted again, Dils had ten days to appeal. The third trial in the Assize Court minors Rh√¥ne opened on 8 April 2002. The law now allowed the trial to be held in public. The majority of public opinion was in favour of Dils, who appeared with a new look, without sunglasses and relaxed. Francis Heaulme was heard again, with prosecution testimony against him. Witnesses said they saw him covered in blood the day of the incident, which he confirmed himself at the bar, claiming to have fallen off his bike. For the first time, Dils spoke of the torments he endured in prison; he was beaten, mocked and raped. He returned to his very detailed confession, which was one of the only pieces of evidence pointing to Dils' guilt. It is still unclear exactly why Dils first accused himself at the beginning of the case. Evidence was produced by the police, showing that Dils did not have time to commit the crime: the children died around 17:00, while Dils was back home until about 18:45. On 23 April 2002, the General Counsel did not charge or sentence him, the jury deliberated for a few hours and Dils was acquitted on 24 April 2002. He was released from jail the same evening. The families of the victims were disappointed, convinced that the court had released a murderer.

Views Protogaea built on, and criticized, the natural philosophy of Ren√© Descartes, as expressed in his Principia Philosophiae. Leibniz in the work adopted the Cartesian theory of the Earth as a sun crusted over with sunspots. He relied on the authority of Agostino Scilla writing about fossils to discredit speculations of Athanasius Kircher and Johann Joachim Becher; he had met Scilla in Rome a few years earlier. He took up suggestions of Nicolaus Steno that argued for the forms of fossils being prior to their inclusion in rocks, for stratification, and for the gradual solidification of the Earth.

Mir changed his Jewish birth name, Edwyn Meyers, to Ezra Mir because he felt his original name \\"lacked Indianness\\". After working originally as a stage actor, he moved to New York in 1924 and started working in film, first as an actor and then later as an editor. During this period he also made his first short film, The Symbolesque (1929). Returning to India, Mir began directing films based on Hindi theatre. He made his first full length film in this genre, Noorjehan, for the Imperial Film Company in 1931, and subsequently Zarina and other films for the Sagar Movietone. He made a number of films for Madan Theatre Studios in the 1930s, and his most well-known work, Rickshawala, was produced by Ranjit Movietone. He then set up his own studio, Everest Pictures, in 1939. During the 1940s, Mir joined the Film Advisory Board and began making documentary films. The three notable shorts he made for them were Making Money, The Road To Victory and the Voice of Satan in 1940. The Road To Victory was about the proclamation of dictatorship and was effectively directed and narrated by Mir. Voice of Satan was a two-reeler about the propaganda used by the Germans in their broadcasting methods. Both the war documentaries were a production of Wadia Movietone, a co-operative effort with the Film Advisory Board. When the Advisory Board was replaced by Information Films of India, Mir continued to work for them, producing newsreels such as Indian News Parade. After the war, he continued documentary work, founding the Indian Documentary Producers Association in 1956, and worked on over 700 documentary films. Mir was appointed Chief Producer of the Ministry of Information's Films Division in 1956; under his management, the Division was highly prolific, releasing newsreels at the rate of one per week as well as over 100 documentary films per year.

The 1883 ft (574 m) long Llinars HSR bridge comprises two parts: a 1008 ft (307 m) long composite steel‚Äìconcrete structure crossing the highway, and a continuous prestressed concrete bridge crossing the Mogent River with a maximum span of 157 ft (48 m). After analyzing many possible color combinations for the Llinars bridge, the designers selected blue for the members above the deck level and gray for the bottom of the longitudinal beams. This combination was intended to make the structure appear more slender. Description The 574 m long Llinars bridge comprises two parts: A 307 m long composite steel and concrete structure crossing tollway 7 and a continuous structure made of prestressed concrete crossing the Mogent River with a maximum span of 48 m. The location of the piers was dictated by the highly skewed angle of the highway crossing and by the launching process used to erect the bridge. The final bridge features a composite steel and concrete deck suspended on structural steel tied members. Construction Construction of the Llinars bridge began in 2003. An effort was made to develop an aesthetically pleasing solution that would be transparent and well suited to the site. To avoid interfering with the operation of Barcelona‚Äôs critically important tollway 7, incremental launching construction methods were used for the composite steel and concrete section. This section includes a deck that is a continuous structure with five spans. The suspension members have a typical box girder cross section with an average depth of 1.7 m. The flange width, 1.6 m, does not vary along the girder. For aesthetic reasons, the members have a radius of curvature of 48.6 m, limiting the large structure‚Äôs vertical clearance over the highway and diminishing its visual obtrusiveness. A complex steel structure with innovative aesthetics. This High-Speed Rail Bridge required a complex dynamic analysis. The launching method used for construction avoided any interference with the traffic below and to complete the structure on time and budget. References *Sobrino, J.A.; Moving at the speed of steel.

The story introduces a local children tradition of rescuing young birds, pufflings. Every August millions of pufflings leave their burrows in the cliffs and take their first flight at night time. Some of them get confused, presumably by street lights, and get stranded in the village streets, where they can become an easy prey for local cats and dogs. The children get ready to take patrols in the night streets, gather the bewildered pufflings in cardboard boxes and later set them free at the beach at daytime. The birds will spend the next year or two at open sea before returning to Heimaey for mating.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 17 February 1993 and was watched by 14.31 million viewers during its original transmission. This was the first episode to consist of a single story line and was shot entirely on location in Southsea.  Plot = Act 1: Checking in and hotel suite problem = For a bank holiday weekend, Mr. Bean decides to stay at the Queens Hotel. Upon parking his Mini at the foot of the entrance stairs, he fights with the bellboy (Matthew Ashforde) over his suitcase, mistaking him for a thief. While Bean is checking in, the bellboy returns and asks Bean to move his car, and Bean hands him the steering wheel with which to go and park the car for him. As Bean checks in, a quiet man (Michael Fenton Stevens) checks in as well and Bean becomes determined to beat the man to his hotel room (room 425), but the man gets to the lift before him. In retaliation, Bean runs up the staircase and stops the lift on every floor. He almost succeeds in entering his room first, but struggles to unlock his door and the man ultimately enters his room before Bean enters his. Once inside his room, Bean immediately starts investigating, such as flicking the light switch on and off rapidly, standing on his suitcase to see the sea through his window, testing out the telephone, jumping on the bed, and when the bellboy returns and clears his throat to ask for a tip, he gives him a cough sweet instead. Bean finds the remote control for the television and initially mistakes it for a phone, due to his own TV at home having no remote. He tests the remote control's signal range and turns the volume up once he is outside his room until his other neighbour in room 427 comes outside to investigate the noise. Bean hides the remote in his jacket and pretends to tell the guest inside room 426 to be quiet, and goes back inside once the neighbour is gone. Back in his room, Bean unpacks his suitcase and places Teddy in his makeshift \\"bed\\" in the drawer, accidentally decapitating him in the process. He personalises the room by changing the lampshade for his own, placing his own curtains on the window and drilling holes to hang framed pictures on the walls (the noise can be heard throughout the hotel). He then decides to have a bath, but realises his room doesn't have a bathroom. Bean then hears running water in room 425, and is annoyed to discover that room has an en suite bathroom whereas his doesn't. Bean uses a glass to listen through the wall to locate the bathroom, and then once the man in room 425 leaves, he uses his drill to cut a giant hole in the wall for him to gain access to the bathroom. Once again, the noise is heard throughout the hotel, and the vibration travels all the way to the lobby and restaurant, prompting the manager (Roger Brierley) to investigate where it is coming from. Just as he knocks on the door to Mr. Bean's room, the man from room 425 complains that he left his watch in the bathroom but can't get the door open. The manager also tries to turn the handle (in vain) and apologises to the man, suggesting that it may be jammed. However, it is revealed that Bean has locked the door and is in the bathtub quickly washing himself. He then finishes and hides the hole with his wardrobe and the curtains from the bathroom. The manager then says that he will have someone come and look at the man's bathroom door just as Bean peeks out of his room wearing nothing but a towel to see what all the fuss is about. The manager notices this as Bean heads back into his room and gives him a suspicious look before walking away. = Act 2: The disgusting oysters = At lunchtime, Bean again tries to beat his neighbour to the dining room by knocking on his door and then running off, only to find that the lift is out of order. Annoyed, he goes to take the fire exit stairs, but becomes even more annoyed when he gets stuck behind a slow- moving elderly woman with a walking frame. Instead of simply asking the lady to let him pass, he decides to go around to the other staircase, but becomes further annoyed when he somehow ends up stuck behind her again. He then contemplates pushing her, but stops himself when he hears a couple walking past. Fed up knowing that it is a big staircase and that he could be there for a long time, he takes a risk and climbs onto the opposite side of the banister to finally get past her. But his victory is short-lived when he ends up behind an equally slow-moving elderly man with 2 walking sticks (presumably the lady's husband). Now stuck between the two with insufficient space to repeat the same tactic and still feeling unable to ask for space to pass, Bean is forced to go down slowly. Once he reaches the restaurant, he takes a plate and cutlery and sees his neighbour and three people ahead of him in the queue. As a result, he cheats his way to the front by knocking the cutlery and napkin from the two people in front of him. Now behind his neighbour, he proceeds to copy what food he is taking from the buffet, but doubling the quantity and even going so far as to fill his entire plate with oysters, and putting back what the man puts back. Bean then steals the table that his neighbour was going to sit at and starts imitating him by drinking water and using a napkin before putting an obscene amount of salt onto his food. He then gluttonously eats whatever the man is eating at a certain time. When the man starts to eat his oysters, Bean eats all of his without smelling them. However, the man notices an odd smell coming from his own oysters and asks the headwaiter about it; the headwaiter smells them and apologizes by saying that they are off, then goes to collect the platter of oysters from the buffet and is repulsed by the smell. Upon seeing what is happening, Bean becomes scared and sickly that he has just eaten rotten oysters. = Act 3: Locked out of the room naked = That night, with lots of tissue paper and a full chest of medicines beside him, Bean feels ill as a result of eating the bad oysters, and wakes up from a shocking nightmare in which his neighbour and the restaurant owner laughing demonically at him while oysters are being eaten nastily. He then removes his pyjamas and underwear (as he feels hot) and is about to go back to sleep completely nude when music blasts him from next door. Bean looks at the alarm clock and upon realizing that it is 12:05 am, gets up while forgetting that he's nude, knocks angrily at the door and shushes loudly. The music stops and he walks back to his room just as the door closes and locks itself. He reaches for his key, only to remember he does not have it, and he is locked outside his room naked. Panicked and humiliated, Bean hides in a doorway as a couple come past from a night out. Once they have gone, he manages to escape by covering himself with a fire extinguisher and several door signs (\\"Private\\", \\"Exit\\", etc.) while avoiding people. He begins to run down the stairs, only to get stuck behind the elderly lady yet again. So he goes back up and heads for the lift; on the way he comes across another couple making out, so he sneaks past them by crawling under the carpet. He then enters the lift, but the door closes on the string by which he is dragging the \\"Exit\\" sign along with him. We then see the floor numbers go down and hear a lady screaming in sheer shock. Down in the lobby, Bean peeks out the lift and sneaks out with \\"Out of Order\\" and \\"No Entry\\" signs, into his work space. Meanwhile, the manager is talking to Danny La Rue (played by himself), who is performing at the hotel, saying his show was marvellous and that they love him. The performer delightfully goes back in to give them an encore. The clerk then gives Matthew (the porter) the keys to the car and tells him to bring them to Mr. La Rue's car. Meanwhile, Mr. Bean gets the keys to his room from the front, and hides behind a pole as Matthew parks the suitcase and leaves. The manager gets back behind his counter and almost sees the suitcase moving several times (Bean being in it changing). Matthew then comes back and locks the suitcase, and brings it out to the car, dropping it on the stairs. Just then, Mr. Bean shows up at the counter in a sparkly gown and wig and lipstick, saying \\"426 please\\", and the manager replies \\"Certainly, madam\\". Right at that moment, Danny La Rue walks by, noticing his stuff is being worn. He approaches angrily, and says to him \\"Here, that's my frock\\" and yanks an earring off Bean's ear, causing Bean to shock out in pain. Cast *Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean *Matthew Ashforde as the hotel porter *Michael Fenton Stevens as the man in Room 425 *Roger Brierley as the hotel manager *Danny La Rue as himself  Production  This was the first episode to incorporate only one storyline instead of separate acts or sketches as well as the first to be shot entirely on location. The episode was filmed at the Queen's Hotel in the seaside resort of Southsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire. Principal photography began on 1 October 1992. It was also the first full episode to be directed by Paul Weiland, previously the series' specialist director for film sequences. Another episode-length story, Mind the Baby, Mr. Bean, was also filmed in Southsea. This was also the first episode to be commissioned and presented for the ITV network by Central Independent Television following the loss of Thames' ITV franchise in London. Central would also oversee commissioning and compliance for a number of other Thames independent productions, such as Minder, Wish You Were Here...? and Strike It Lucky, until the ITV Network Centre removed the requirement for a 'commissioning company' in the late 1990s. \\"Homeless\\" from Mr. Bean: The Animated Series was inspired by this episode. The last scene also inspired the episode \\"Opera Bean\\" where Bean wears a lady's frock. The ending of the second act, in which Mr. Bean realizes that he ate spoiled oysters is the reason why he doesn't like them in Mr. Bean's Holiday. Another scene in the film that alludes to this episode is that he passes by a kissing couple at Gare de Lyon as he leaves the restaurant when he overhears the screams of a woman who found oysters in her purse while picking up her cell phone, whereas, in this episode, he passes by a kissing couple underneath the hotel rug while naked and locked out of his hotel room.  Censorship  Some scenes of Bean naked during the final part of the episode were edited out for broadcasts on Disney Channel and Philippine network ABS-CBN. This episode was never broadcast on Nickelodeon UK, possibly due to Bean being naked for the majority of the last act.

Rix & Sons Ltd is a family-owned British business that is headquartered in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. The roots of the company date back to 1873 when founder Robert Rix, the son of a Norfolk farmer, established a ship building business in Teesside, which he subsequently moved to Hull in 1883.A History of Robert Rix & Sons & J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd by Graham Atkinson Today J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd is involved in a large range of activities ranging from commercial, residential and marine fuel distribution, fuel cards, ship owning, stevedoring, warehousing and offshore wind farm support to holiday home manufacturing, car retail and property, through a number of subsidiaries of which the largest is Rix Petroleum Ltd. Others include Rix Heating Services; Rix Shipping; Rix Sea Shuttle; Maritime Bunkering; Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd; Jordans Cars; Rix Truck Services; Fuelmate, and; Victory Leisure Homes. In 2014 the company was ranked 30th in the Sunday Times‚Äô Top Track 250. The current chairman of J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd, Tim Rix CBE, is the great-great- grandson of founder Robert and was awarded the CBE in the 2018 Honours List for services to the economy and regeneration on the Humber region. Early years Robert Rix Robert Rix was born in March 1841 into a farming family in Burnham Overy, Norfolk, and at age 10 was sent to work on the land. However, he did not take to the work and within two years had run away to sea. He joined a small sailing coaster on the Tees and his early career was spent trading with northern Scottish ports down to South Wales and later the near Continent. He settled in Stockton-on-Tees in the North East of England and in 1862 married Margaret Dobson. It was while living here that he first established a shipbuilding company on the south bank of the Tees while at the same time continuing to work as a captain. The couple produced seven children and moved to Hull in 1883 where Robert continued his business. Robert was joined in the business by his three sons, John Robert (Bob), Ernest Bertie (Bert) and Herbert Dobson (Herbie), and continued to expand his fleet with the addition of several steamers. In 1908 he came ashore to manage the business from the office. =1914‚Äì1918= Due to an increased demand for freight tonnage during the Great War, Robert Rix & Sons increased revenue and profit throughout the period and invested in a ship building programme to modernise its fleet. The company also offloaded a number of older steamers which were fetching higher prices than in peacetime. In 1916 and 1917 Robert Rix & Sons took delivery of two pairs of steamships from Cochrane & Sons Ltd in Selby, which for the first time bore the family name. These were the Magrix, the Robrix, and Jarrix and the Ebbrix and they set the precedent by which all Rix ships would be named from then on. =1920s ‚Äì 1950s= The early 1920s were a difficult period for ship owners due to the depressed economic conditions and the increasing popularity of rail freight, but Robert Rix & Sons continued to grow its fleet with the addition of six ships, many of which were used to work the east coast coal trading routes. In November 1925 Robert Rix died following a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 84. He had worked right up to his death, leaving the office the day before along with the rest of the staff. In 1927 the roots of the largest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons group, Rix Petroleum Ltd, were established when Robert Rix & Sons began importing tractor vaporising oil to the UK to fuel the post-war agricultural revolution. The company also carried lamp oil from Russia to the Humber on Rix ships. This led to such an expansion that by 1939 the company owned 11 ships spread across four companies. =1939 ‚Äì 1947= Freight rates increased again before the Second World War which meant the value of elderly steam coasters rose and Robert Rix & Sons sold a number of vessels. The company also lost two ships during the war; one, the Malrix hit a mine off Southend in December 1940 and the Pegrix sank off the Norfolk coast after colliding with Coast Line‚Äôs Normandy Coast. The company helped the war effort directly in several ways. The Ebbrix was taken for special duties on the east coast of Scotland as part of the invasion of Europe and Kenrix‚Äôs master, Capt. George Simison, was awarded the Atlantic Star medal for his participation in the Normandy Landings. During the war years the shipping companies were run by Robert Kenneth Rix (Ken) and the petroleum business by John Leslie Rix (Les), both sons of Bob Rix. After the war, however, Malcolm and Geoffrey Rix, sons of Bert and Herbie respectively, both expressed an interest in joining the firm. Bob felt the company was not big enough to support the extra family members and it was finally decided that the partnership should be dissolved. Bert and Herbie became equal partners in Robert Rix & Sons and Bob, Ken and Les left to establish J.R. Rix & Sons. J.R. Rix & Sons started life on January 1947 with a working capital of ¬£7,000 and one motor ship, the Magrix, in offices in the Bank of England Chambers, Whitefriargate, Hull, but did not become a limited company until 14 February 1957. In the meantime, several Rix companies still in existence today were established including Rix Shipping Co Ltd (Rix Shipping), formed in March 1950, and Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd, formerly Piggins Rix Ltd, based in Montrose, Scotland. Piggins Rix Ltd grew out of Rix Limes Ltd which had been established to supply limestone mined in quarries in the East Riding of Yorkshire to the Scottish agricultural market. The lime was transported by sea from Hull to Montrose on Rix ships where it was discharged by J.M. Piggins Ltd. J.R. Rix & Sons bought the company ‚Äì its first owned interest in Scotland ‚Äì and renamed it Piggins Rix Ltd. A short time later Rix Petroleum established a fuel depot there to serve the offshore industry and its growing domestic, agricultural and haulage customers. Piggins Rix Ltd was renamed Rix Shipping (Scotland) Ltd in January 2013. Rix Shipping Ltd Rix Shipping was formed on 23 March 1950, making it is the oldest company in the J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd group, however it did not become a limited company until 14 February 1957. It started out with a single ship, Magrix (2) but the company soon acquired two further vessels: Roxton, from Middlesbrough owners, and a ship bought from Swedish owners which the company renamed as the Jarrix (2). Rix Shipping Ltd established regular voyages for coal from Amble, Blyth and Goole for Teignmouth, Exmouth, Hayle, Penryn, Falmouth and Penzance, with back cargoes of china clay and stone chippings. Another regular cargo was sulphate of ammonia from the Tyne or Tees bound for Ipswich and Avonmouth and in 1958 Rix Shipping Ltd began carrying agricultural limestone from Whitby to North Eastern Scottish ports as well as chalk, mined from Little Weighton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, from Hull. Over the years the company continued to expand its fleet by both buying ships and commissioning new vessels to be built until by the early sixties it had four motor ships all under five years old. This enabled the business to trade with near continental ports as well as those in the Baltic and Bay of Biscay. Regular return cargoes included seasonal crops, including French onion sellers who, complete with bikes, were carried in the ship‚Äôs hold with the onions. Today Rix Shipping Ltd is based at the head office of parent firm, J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd, in Spyvee Street, Hull, and owns and operates a fleet of estuarial tank barges, coastal tankers and high speed crew transfer workboats. Its main business activities include carriage of petroleum products, carriage of engineers to maintain wind turbines and stevedoring services through Hull's King George Dock and Montrose in Scotland. Rix Shipping Ltd also owns 25 acres of secure storage and warehousing space close to King George Dock in the east of the city and significant areas of land and warehousing in Montrose. Rix Petroleum Ltd Rix Petroleum Ltd is the largest subsidiary of J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd which turned over ¬£425.4 million in 2011. It is headquartered in Hull but has depots across the UK, from Aberdeen down to Coleshill in the West Midlands. A Rix fuel tanker A now closed Rix filling station in Hornsea, East Riding of Yorkshire. The roots of Rix Petroleum go back to 1927 when Robert Rix & Sons began importing tractor vaporising oil and lamp oil from Russia to supply local garages. The war years saw the business expand and supply commercial diesel customers in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the road transport industry. Domestic customers also provided an opportunity for the business as many households converted to cheaper, oil-fired central heating and the agricultural sector opened up as farmers turned from horses to tractors. The company was incorporated in June 1956 operates a fleet of more than 100 tankers in the UK serving agriculture and agribusiness, hauliers and other fleet-vehicle operators and the residential heating oil market customers. Its red, white and blue logo has remained relatively unchanged for many decades and is a common site on tankers, particularly around Yorkshire, but also in other regions where the business operates. Maritime Bunkering Ltd The demand for marine fuel also spawned another Rix company, Maritime Bunkering Ltd, which supplies marine fuels to vessels on the Humber Estuary. Jordan & Co (Hull) Ltd Jordan & Co (Hull) Ltd is a car dealership based in Witham, close to central Hull that is well known locally as a Rix-owned business. The business was established in the early 1900s as a bicycle retailer based on High Street in Hull City Centre. In the 1920s it progressed to selling motorcycles and in the 1950s became a car retailer. In 1960 the roots of the modern day business were laid down after Rix Petroleum acquired the Jubilee filling station on Holderness Road in the city, which was also the site of a BMC car dealership. The location became the site of Jordans & Co (Hull) Ltd, where it remains to this day. Over time BMC vehicles lost out to more reliable Japanese brands and therefore the company began selling Datsun, which later became Nissan. Jordans, as it is known locally, was recently the subject of a ¬£300,000 investment in its showroom facilities to become the UK‚Äôs first ever Fiat \\"super centre\\". Hepworth Shipyard Ltd In 1977 J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd bought the Paull-based shipbuilder J.R. Hepworth & Co (Hull) Ltd and a formed new company, Hepworth Shipyard Ltd, which built small craft such as trawlers and tugs at its location on the north bank of the Humber. The yard successfully continued shipbuilding until 2012 and was for many years the last remaining shipbuilder on the Humber as all other yards had turned to repairs only. But after completing the 53m long Lerrix for Rix Shipping Ltd early last year, the company was closed and the premises was let to Dunston (Shipbuilders) Ltd, a new business dedicated to making aluminium boats for the wind farm industry. Fuelmate Ltd Along with its core services of supplying commercial diesel and residential heating oil, Rix Petroleum also provided UK fuel cards to help its customers manage their fuel costs effectively. However, as demand for fuel cards increased, J.R. Rix & Sons Ltd decided to create a specialist fuel card supplier to complement the services of Rix Petroleum; in 2008 it launched Fuelmate Ltd. Victory Leisure Homes Ltd Victory Leisure Homes Ltd is a holiday home and lodge manufacturer established by J.R. Rix & Sons in April 2009, after the demise of Cosalt Holiday Homes in the previous year. Cosalt had occupied land adjacent to Rix Road Industrial Estate, a 12-acre site owned by Rix on Stoneferry in the east of Hull; when it ceased trading Rix decided to buy the factory, land and plant to create its own caravan and lodge manufacturing facility and increase the size of its land holding in the area to 20 acres. Three years after being founded the business outgrew its initial base and moved to a modern manufacturing plant in Gilberdyke, East Riding of Yorkshire, around 20 miles west of Hull city centre, the former home of modular buildings maker Britspace, which went into administration in 2011. Rix Sea Shuttle Ltd Rix Sea Shuttle is the most recently established business in the J.R. Rix & Sons group. It was founded in 2012 to provide high speed crew transfer boats for wind farm personnel and equipment from the east coast of the UK to offshore wind farms in the North Sea. The business was created in response to the burgeoning renewables industry, particularly offshore wind farms, much of which is centred round the Humber Ports complex of Hull, Immingham and Grimsby. Rix Sea Shuttle owns five specially-constructed wind farm work boats built in Blyth, Northumberland, and in Paull on the north bank of the Humber Estuary. The company plans to increase the size of its fleet by 2015. ReferencesFurther reading * External links * Official Rix page Companies based in Kingston upon Hull ","title":"J.R.

Since 1982, it houses the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael.  History  The estate as it was at the end of the 17th century The name Clingendael means valley in the dunes. In 1591, Philips Doublet acquired the farm and surrounding land. The original part of the manor house was built between 1643 and 1660 for Philip Doublet III. Several of the Doublets held the office of Treasurer General in the Republic of the Seven United Provinces. Philip's wife was the sister of the celebrated poet and statesman, Constantijn Huygens, and Philip‚Äôs son married one of Huygens‚Äô daughters, Suzanna. The architecture of the original part of Clingendael shares some of the features of the Huygens‚Äôs country house in Voorburg, Hofwijck. In 1804, the estate passed on to Baron Willem van Brienen. His son, Baron Arnoud van Brienen, merged Clingendael with the neighbouring estate of Oosterbeek. The two estates are separated by a meandering moat. He also built a racecourse for his guests at Clingendael; it has since been moved to nearby Duindigt. Arnout‚Äôs unmarried daughter Margu√©rite, known as Lady Daisy, laid out Clingendael‚Äôs fine Japanese garden. In 1914, the manor house was renovated by the architect , and was expanded in 1915 by and J.Th. Wouters. During World War II, the estate was confiscated by the Nazis and occupied by Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart. The many bunkers in the grounds of the estate date from this period. After the war, Baron Edgar Michiels van Verduynen and his family, and Baron Johann Edzard von Ripperda and his family moved into the two estates. Both families had lost their respective, ancestral homes during the war. In 1953, the gardens and parkland were sold to the state and, subsequently, opened up to the public. The families Michiels van Verduynen and Von Ripperda remained at the combined Clingendael-Oosterbeek estate. Since 1982, following a thorough renovation, the manor is home the Clingendael Institute.  Japanese Garden  The Japanese Garden was created in the beginning of the 20th century by Baroness Margu√©rite van Brienen (1871-1939), also called Lady Daisy. Lady Daisy sailed off a number of times by ship to Japan and brought back to the Netherlands a number of lanterns, a water cask, sculptures, the pavilion, the little bridges and several plants. The original design with the serene pond, meandering brook and the winding pathways has remained intact all these years. The Municipality of The Hague has always taken great care of the Japanese Garden because of its uniqueness and tremendous historical value. The garden was placed on the list of national historical monuments in 2001. Due to its fragility, the garden can be visited only during a short period of the year.

That year was 200 years after Ivar Aasen was born. It was 100 years after Det Norske Teatret (The Norwegian Theatre) opened. Ivar Aasen's life work was the development of Nynorsk (New Norse), a language with grammar and vocabulary based upon the way ordinary Norwegians, primarily rural, spoke. After a few hundred years under Danish rule, many in the cities as well as everyone educated in Denmark, spoke and wrote Danish and Danish was taught in schools. Det Norske Teatret is a theatre in Oslo that primarily produces plays in Nynorsk. These two jubilees were the main reasons for the decision to create a national year of celebration of languages. Spr√•k√•ret 2013 was a stand-alone project, organised within the Nynorsk kultursentrum (Nynorsk culture center) and funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture.  Valuable cultural expressions  The purpose of Spr√•k√•ret 2013 was to embrace and celebrate the diversity of language that exists in Norway. One sought to put focus on the positive effects that arise out of living in a country with several languages. The two official written versions of Norwegian, Bokm√•l and Nynorsk, the language of the indigenous people in the north, S√°mi, and the three recognised national minority languages; Kvensk, romani, romanes as well as Norwegian sign language, another official language. In addition there is huge variation in local dialects as well as the many languages spoken by immigrants. The year of 2013 was dedicated to celebrating, discussing, and trying to raise awareness of the valuable cultural expressions and identities that are connected to languages and dialects.  Objectives for the year  * To create stronger linguistic self-esteem amongst people who have Nynorsk as their preferred language and moreover to heighten public acceptance of the country's language-divided culture.'' * To increase pride in the linguistic culture of Nynorsk, also among the people who have Bokm√•l as their preferred language. * To increase knowledge of and respect for the native language S√°mi, minority languages, immigrant- languages and sign language. * To put the language situation in Norway into international and comparative perspectives.'' *To take an initiative to more contact among language-policy actors with common interests that cross linguistic borders and ethnicity.'' In an interview in December 2013, the leader of the language year project, the author Inger Johanne S√¶terbakk, said that the language year had lived a life of its own; many arrangements occurred without central steering. No one knows how many there were, but it was more than a thousand. S√¶terbakk said that she saw that the use of dialects have an emotional element, while written language is used more as a tool. While she regretted that it wasn't possible to engage minority language groups more, she was very pleased with the activity-level all around the country.

It was originally scheduled for broadcast on 1 March 1993 on ITV but following the murder of Kirkby toddler James Bulger on 12 February 1993, it was delayed for over a year until 25 April 1994.  Plot = Act 1: The Baby = Mr. Bean decides to go to a funfair at Southsea, Portsmouth; However, he has difficulty finding it especially after some people at the beach give him contradicting directions, but is eventually successful in locating the fair. However, the boot handle of his Mini was not in its locked position and as he reverses and moves forward again, a baby's pram gets caught in the handle, and tags along with him to the funfair. Once Bean notices the \\"kidnapped\\" baby, he initially attempts to leave it in a crowd of chatting mothers with babies, but they are oblivious to both Bean and the baby's presence, and leave the baby behind. Being a responsible citizen, Bean reluctantly goes back for him. Bean, however, sees a policeman outside the amusement park entrance and races to find him, but loses him among a crowd of teenagers wearing fake police helmets from a nearby gift shop. Bean eventually realises that he has no choice but to look after the baby whilst enjoying himself. Bean unchains a guard dog and uses the chain to tie the baby's pram while taking the baby with him on various rides. First, he goes to the dodgems, but in his hurry to pay the man in charge, he puts the baby's feet on the pedal and has difficulty getting back to the dodgem by riding on the back of other dodgems and driving his own while standing up. The man in charge stops the dodgems and confronts Bean, who manages to hide the baby and sneak off. = Act 2: The Kiddie Ride = Bean finds a Postman Pat kiddie ride and decides to put the baby inside to cheer him up; however, he then puts nine coins in it so it will play for a long time and keep the baby safe while Bean can go off and have fun on his own. Bean goes on a roller coaster, but quickly gets bored and falls asleep (though he is frightened by someone awakening him). He then goes to an archery range but accidentally hits the employee in the head, before running off. He tries his hand with a coin pusher game in an amusement arcade and tries to cheat by repeatedly hitting the machine after running out of coins. He succeeds in releasing many coins from the machine, but gets his comeuppance when a young boy (who he tried to stop from doing so earlier) steals his prize. Meanwhile, a long queue builds up by the kiddie ride. Bean, apparently oblivious to the queue, tries to put more coins in when an angry mother confronts him by complaining to him that they have been waiting for half an hour and makes him take the baby out. Disgruntled, Bean obliges. = Act 3: Changing the Nappy = While walking the baby in his pram, Bean suddenly detects a bad smell and, after some pondering over the source of the smell, realises that the baby needs its nappy (diaper) changed. Unable to find any fresh nappies in the pram, Bean steals a teddy bear from a little girl (pretending that he will look after it while she goes on a ride), cuts the stuffing out and uses it as a makeshift nappy for the baby while leaving the real nappy to be blown about the funfair and ending up on various people's faces and a man's toffee apple. Unfortunately, the baby cries and Bean tries to calm him with his squeaky toy, but the guard dog he set free earlier on follows the noise (comically barking each time Bean squeaks the toy) and gets close to the baby. Though the dog means harm towards neither Bean nor the baby, Bean lures the dog into a ticket booth and locks it inside. In order to cheer the baby up, Bean cheats in a game of darts by prematurely piercing cards with his darts and throwing them in such a way that it appears he hit a card with all three darts, winning a goldfish. But the plastic bag carrying the fish leaks, and when the water fountain proves to be not working, Bean desperately puts the fish and the remaining water in his mouth in order to keep it alive. He then plays a round of Bingo and wins, but upon shouting \\"Bingo!\\", he reflexively swallows the water, along with the fish. Fortunately, he manages to spit the goldfish out of his mouth and into a fishbowl with another goldfish; Bean notices this and smiles before leaving. = Act 4: The Reunion = Later on, the baby cries again, and this time, nothing Bean does calms him down. Bean buys lots of balloons and ties them to the pram, but, although it succeeds in making the baby stop crying, the balloons carry the pram into the sky while Bean is paying the vendor. In panic after seeing this, Bean steals a bow and arrow from the archery game where he hit the operator, sharpens the tip of the wooden arrow with a pencil sharpener and fires it, popping some balloons and allowing the pram to land right in the same spot Bean accidentally took it from, where the baby's mother is complaining to the police. The mother is reunited with the baby, much to Bean's relief. Bean almost forgets to return the squeaky toy to the baby, but realises how much he will miss the baby and decides to keep the toy to remember his little friend. Satisfied about returning the baby to his mother, Bean starts to drive home, unaware that the guard dog, having escaped from the ticket booth, has sneaked into the back of his Mini after Bean squeaked the toy. As he drives off, Bean squeaks the toy again and the dog barks, shocking Bean.

It was proven to be plausible, although an impracticably large number of balloons were needed for it to actually work. =Casting= Matthew Ashforde who played the hotel porter in Mr. Bean in Room 426, returned as the young man with toffee apple. =Music= A cover of Shakin' All Over performed by The Guess Who is featured in the episode,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0651845/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd making it the only episode to feature licensed music.

This building is and architecture from the colonial period. It is a representation and legacy of the German occupation in Cameroon.  History  Its master-builder, David Mandessi Bell, was a wealthy planter and King Rudolf's intendant. He lived there until his death in 1936. He was among the first Cameroonians whose revenues were not exclusively related to fishing or doing business. In 1840, when the slave trade was officially prohibited, the Duala turned to other sources of income, as their commercial monopoly was also on the decline. For instance, they initiated plantations in the Nkam, the Abo, or the Mungo. Although of less importance than the huge German farms on the slopes of mount Fako, they nevertheless provided substantial income, enough to build houses such as this one. This building was constructed in heritage of his son Sam (1911-1978). His son Sam, born in 1911 (died in 1978), continued the farming activity, and lived in this house half of his life. His adoptive brother, Jean Mandessi Bell, along with L√©opold Moum√© Etia, founded l'Union Camerounaise in Paris, in 1937-38. Consistent with their wish for independence, this organization aimed at obtaining the mandate status for Cameroon. Later, Jean Mandessi Bell became an activist of the Jeucafra (Jeunesse Camerounaise Fran√ßaise) led by Paul Soppo Priso. As the first political association that was acknowledged, if not favored by France, Jeucafra fought against a German come-back in Cameroon, at the eve of the 2nd World War. In their wish to make Cameroon a colony, rather than a territory under mandate, this political group was much criticized, accused of collaborating with the French. Yet it was to become, according to Um Nyob√®, the melting pot of the country's first political activists. In 2006 the building is highlighted by an urban sign produced by doual'art and designed by Sandrine Dole; the sign presents an historical image of the building and a description of its history.La Villa Mandessi-Bell in Douala Ville d'art et d'histoire, doual'art, Douala, 2006. Architecture Business activities in front of Villa Mandessi Bell Built from 1904 to 1909-1910, at the end of the German pacification campaign (soon to be followed by the first town-planning groundwork), this house of patrician size is typical of the German and colonial architecture. The rectangular form, which is constructed with mud bricks facilitates the regulation of the temperature. Its vast roof top protects it from storms which are common in the litorial bounded by the equatorial climate. It is a testimony of the wish of Mandessi Bell, to confirm his success.

Although there is no settlement within that area so named, it still retains its distinct community character with its own parish church and primary school. The only concentrated collection of dwellings is the small hamlet of Knock near its eastern border that is nestled beneath the hill of the same name that, though no higher than 430 metres, dominates both it and the all the agrarian haughs that extend from the Grampians to the coastal plains. The total area is 6,089 Hectares (15,048 Acres). From north to south it stretches for 9.5 km (6 miles) and from east to west it spans 8 km (5 miles) making it almost square. The population in 1991 was 723, a slight increase from the previous census after gradual decline.

During the school year, the young leaders from all the communities where the program is running are convened once every few weeks to continue their training and learn from one another about what is happening in the various settlements. Those who are selected to guide additional year, undergo advanced training on leadership and science and are more responsible for the operation of current activities in the communities . After finishing high school, the leaders can choose one of the following possibilities: studies as a part of academic reserve program, service year along with military service, national service and pre-military preparation course. Graduates who have committed military service / national service can get academic scholarships. Students in academy constitute a significant program. Thus, we see the closure of the circle and creating scientific leadership inside the community. The Science Festival As part of their training, all of the program's Youth participate and guide in a science festival which takes place in Beit Yaziv and Karaso Park of Science.

It was first broadcast on ITV on 10 January 1994 and was watched by 15.60 million viewers during its original transmission.  Plot = Act 1: New Year Party = It's New Year's Eve 1993 and Mr. Bean is excited. He has invited his two best friends Rupert and Hubert over to his flat for a New Year party and is putting the finishing touches on his decorations, which aren't much (a circle of chairs in the living room and a bunch of balloons hanging from the front door). He greets his neighbour who is also throwing a party, and goes back inside to prepare for his guests' arrival. Soon enough, Rupert and Hubert arrive, and they realise that it's not really the party they were expecting: Bean gives his guests party hats made of newspaper, assigns them designated chairs, and the only form of entertainment is a radio. Bean then goes to the kitchen to prepare refreshments. However, he finds he has almost run out of Twiglets, and so improvises by chopping up a branch outside his kitchen window with a butcher knife and dipping the twigs in Marmite in an attempt to disguise them. He then opens a bottle of Champagne, but discovers that there is only enough to fill half a glass. As Rupert and Hubert wait in the living room, Bean improvises again by using a bottle of vinegar and adding sugar to sweeten it. As the night goes on, it becomes apparent that Rupert and Hubert are not having a good time. They've uncovered that the \\"food\\" they've been given isn't genuine (there is a small leaf growing on one of the sticks on Rupert's plate and Hubert is repulsed by the smell of vinegar) and refuse to eat it, despite Bean eating his and pretending to like it. Bean then heads back to the kitchen and takes peanuts from a bird feeder outside and pours them onto a plate. Meanwhile, Rupert and Hubert, fed up with Bean's awful party and now desperate to leave, turn the clock in the living room to just before midnight. When Bean comes back, the clock chimes and Rupert and Hubert say \\"Happy New Year!\\". Bean is also happy, saying \\"Doesn't time fly while you're enjoying yourself?\\". They then link hands (almost forgetting Teddy) and sing \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" to celebrate (although Bean over-excitedly rushes through the song). Rupert and Hubert then feign yawning and claim that they are tired, so Bean puts the doorknob back on his door (for some reason he had taken it off and put it into a fruit bowl; this is a running gag throughout the episode) and bids them goodnight. Right outside the door, Rupert and Hubert come across two women who laugh at their paper hats before heading into the neighbour's flat, where a swinging New Year's party is underway. They then ponder whether to leave or go to the party, ultimately deciding to do the latter. Meanwhile, Bean is in bed and puts Teddy next to him before turning off the light and going to sleep. However, he hears the countdown process at the party across from him as well as everyone singing \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", indicating the real New Year has started. Confused, he turns the light back on and takes a small clock out of his chest of drawers, which indicates that it's just past midnight (at this point, the clock in the living room shows 1:40). He is angered when he finds out that Rupert and Hubert deceived him and attended the larger party next door. Just as Bean switches off the light, a person from the party shouts \\"Three cheers for Rupert and Hubert!\\". He then goes back to sleep. = Act 2: The Department Store Sale = Rowan Atkinson recreating a famous scene from the episode on a Mini at Goodwood Circuit On New Year's Day 1994, Bean drives to the Arding & Hobbs department store in order to take full advantage of the January sales, nearly running over several pedestrians while parking. Dozens of other people have queued overnight to get there first, but Bean manages to jump the queue and annoy everyone in the process by revealing that he created the \\"person\\" as a dummy, which he placed there the night before in order to cheat his way to the front of the queue. When the doors finally open, Bean excitedly runs in, but not knowing where to go first, he heads downstairs. Later, Bean has purchased many items, including the armchair that was on display in the window, tins of paint, brushes and mops. After strapping the armchair to the roof, he runs into a problem: because he squeezed everything else inside of his Mini, there is no room left for himself. However, he manages to construct a way of driving the Mini while sitting on the armchair strapped to the roof. He first places a brick attached to a string in front of the front wheel to hold the Mini, and releases the handbrake. He then uses a paint can attached to another string to operate the clutch, further strings for the gear stick and steering wheel, and joins his mop and broom together to form a long rod with which to operate the accelerator and footbrake. At first, all goes incredibly well, but he ends up on a steep downhill slope after swerving to avoid a roadworks barrier (and behind a parked police car: When policeman eating a bread). He desperately tries to keep the Mini under control as it starts to pick up speed, and things get worse when the head accidentally comes off the broom. Now with no way to stop the Mini, his only braking method is to drive it into a parked lorry delivering mattresses, creating an explosion of pillow feathers. = Act 3: Painting with Fireworks = Back at the flat, Bean begins to redecorate with the new items he bought, although it doesn't go as planned. He first realises that moving the table from in front of the hole in the kitchen wall is impractical, as he can no longer place objects on it through the hole while he is in the kitchen (he drops three glass objects, which smash to the floor). His solution: just move the hole. After getting exact measurements using three pencils (one in his mouth and one in each hand), he uses a reciprocating saw to cut out a section of the wall before moving it into the original hole. However, he neglects to consider what is on the opposite side of the wall, and cuts through a telephone cable and a picture of kittens (including decapitating one of Prince Charles and Princess Diana) in the process. He also cuts a picture of a body builder, near the groin area. He then begins to paint the whole living room white, but finds that the bristles on his paintbrush are dried solid. He uses a hammer to attempt to soften them, but when he goes into the living room and dips the brush into the paint, the bristles disappear into the paint, annoying Bean. In a cruel improvisation, he shoves the brush handle into Teddy's rear and uses his head to paint the walls. However, he manages to only get a few lines of paint done before accidentally dripping paint onto things. Bean then realises a more efficient way of painting the wall. He carefully covers virtually everything in the living room and kitchen (including each individual grape in his fruit bowl) in newspaper and, when he runs out of newspaper to cover his clock, uses the hat Hubert left behind. Bean then looks through his box of fireworks until he finds a suitable one to explode the can of paint. He places the firework in the paint can and ignites the fuse; however, as he tries to escape, he realises that there is no doorknob as he has wrapped it up and put it in the fruit bowl. He retrieves it and manages to escape just as the firecrackers are about to explode. Bean quickly runs out and hides behind a corner in the hall. At that moment, a tired and hungover Hubert stumbles out of the neighbour's flat covered in lipstick from the party he and Rupert attended. He is just about to leave, when he realises that he left his hat in Bean's flat and goes in to retrieve it just as the firecracker explodes. As Bean returns to his flat, he is puzzled to find his front door wide open and a trail of white footprints leading out to the stairs. He goes inside and is satisfied that his paint bomb worked, as his whole flat is covered with white paint. However, he is shocked to discover a silhouette of Hubert fetching his hat (which Bean had used to cover his clock) is frozen onto a section of wall as the only unpainted area (and his clock covered in paint). The episode ends with Bean looking at the camera with a confused look on his face. = Deleted scene = The following scene was originally cut from the episode in the middle of Act 2, although it was included in early United States VHS releases. Mr. Bean is shopping in a department store, when he sees a chair that he wishes to purchase. Upon approaching the reclining chair, he discovers that a sales assistant is already demonstrating its features to an elderly couple. When Bean realises that the couple wants to take the chair, Bean find the ways of fooling them into thinking it's broken: he unplugs it, which is almost immediately noticed by the assistant. While the elderly woman enjoyably sitting on a chair, Bean then sneaks up to a control panel on the chair's arm and tampering the wires inside, unknown to the elderly woman. As the elderly woman tries out the reclining feature this time, it folds over, sandwiching her in the middle, she yells to her hearing-impaired husband for help but is unheard despite being only a couple of metres away. In addition, Bean turns up the music playing on the store's intercom, to make it harder for her to be heard. Ultimately, she falls backwards. Cast *Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean *Robert Austin as the party guest *Simon Godley as Rupert *Helen Burns as the woman on the narrow sofa *David Stoll (uncredited) *Rupert Vansittart as Hubert *Andy Greenhalgh (uncredited)  Production  Location scenes were recorded on ENG videotape at Arding & Hobbs (ran at the time as an Allders department store) in Battersea. Studio sequences were recorded at Teddington Studios, although for safety reasons, part of Act 3 was filmed without a live audience. It was also the first episode produced by Tiger Aspect founder Peter Bennett-Jones. During its second transmission, the episode was watched by 12.96 million viewers, outrating the final two episodes of the series. Along with \\"Mr. Bean in Room 426\\", this episode has never been repeated on Nickelodeon UK for unknown reasons.  Legacy  MythBusters tested the idea of painting with explosives in Mind Control after being inspired by a rerun of the episode. They first ran tests to see if it was really possible to cover an entire room with paint by exploding a firework in a paint can, but the method was proven impossible by the test. In a later revisit in Painting with Explosives/Bifurcated Boat, Jamie Hyneman's twist on Mr. Bean's technique using a steel sphere was also busted while Adam Savage's snowflake frame twist on the idea worked, but not well enough to be either busted, confirmed or judged plausible. The scene Act 2 where Bean uses a brick attached by some string to hold his car and releases the emergency brake was later reused in the episode \\"In the Pink\\" from Mr. Bean: The Animated Series where Bean uses the technique in order to arrest the thieves. In 2015, a recreation of the car stunt scene was staged in central London to promote the 25th anniversary of the series, ending with a photo call outside Buckingham Palace.  Censorship  Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on August 31, 1997 the scene where Bean accidentally decapitates her picture while cutting a new serving hatch has been removed from some broadcasts, only showing Prince Charles, whose head Bean cuts through with the jigsaw, possibly as mark of respect.

She is the CEO of Nayla Al Khaja Films, a Dubai-based company previously named D-Seven Motion Pictures, and is also founder of The Scene Club, Dubai‚Äôs first film club, launched in 2007. Al-KhƒÅja wrote, produced and directed several films, presented and awarded in international film festivals. Since 2018, Al-KhƒÅja focuses on directing films. She is also a motivational speaker, a cultural consultant and an influencer. Beginnings Holder of a degree in Mass Communication from Dubai Women's College, she graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor in Image Studies and Filmmaking from Ryerson University (Canada). Back in Dubai, she directed and produced the documentary Unveiling Dubai. Supported by H.H. Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, UAE‚Äôs Minister of Higher Education, the film premiered at the 2006 Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF) and he officially announced her as the first woman filmmaker in the UAE. Filmmaker Paving the way for her career as a professional film director, al-Khaja shot several debut films as of 1993. Her first 8mm work was a film called Sweet Sixteen (1996). It was entirely shot in the deserts of Mirdif and was immediately followed by The Will (released in 2003), in collaboration with Tim Smythe, from the Dubai production company Filmworks. She experimented the documentary style with 3adi.com (1998), followed by two narratives, Cockroach (2004) and The Loss (2005). In 2006, Al Khaja wrote and directed her first commissioned short film, Arabana about child abuse (with the support of Unicef), which premiered at DIFF 2007. The same year, she was awarded the title of Best Emirati Filmmaker. She wrote and directed three more short films: Once (2009), Malal (2010) and The Neighbor (2013).

Animal also received the Jury Award in the \\"Narrative Film\\" category at the Ras Al Khaimah Fine Arts Festival (UAE) in February 2018. Since 2017, Al Khaja has been developing her first feature film, Animal, and was awarded an accreditation to present the project at the Producers Network during the Cannes Film Festival (France) in May 2018.

Over the years, she has produced in numerous promotional films and TV commercials in the UAE for local and international brands, while mentoring young Arab talents. In 2015, her company was hired by Discovery Studios for a TV show about Dubai housewives. An American reality- show channel bought the rights for this show and D-Seven Motion Pictures line- produced its pilot, entirely shot in Dubai. The same year, the Dubai Film and TV Commission asked Al Khaja‚Äôs company to shoot a behind-the-scenes film for Star Trek Beyond to highlight Dubai as a regional filming hub. Her film club, The Scene Club (22,000 registered members) has been continuously presenting a wide selection of independent movies and award-winning films in their original format to UAE audiences. The year 2017 marked the 10th anniversary of the club. In 2017 D-Seven Motion Pictures rebranded to Nayla Al Khaja Films.

The books are written in Classical Gaelic,. and are best known for their traditional account of the history of Clan Donald.. The manuscripts are commonly referred to as the Red Book and the Black Book. The name \\"Red Book\\", however, may actually be a misnomer. Although Gaelic tradition on South Uist notes a \\"Red Book of MacMhuirich\\", it is uncertain whether this book is identical to the surviving manuscript. In fact, the manuscript may be partly derived from the red book of tradition. The name \\"Black Book\\" may have been coined in order to distinguish it from the so-called Red Book. The Red Book was composed by Niall MacMhuirich, a member of the MacMhuirich bardic family, who wrote the clan history within, and was responsible for the collection of some of the manuscript's other poetical material. A later hand also added material into the book. Compared to the Red Book, the Black Book is more of a miscellaneous collection of material. This manuscript was compiled by several people, but the history within this work was written by Christopher Beaton, a member of the Beaton learned family, who appears to have been employed by the family of the Earls of Antrim.

It uniquely occurs at folios 165 recto 168 recto of Digby 86, where it is preceded by a Latin text on truths and followed by an English charm listing 77 names for a hare. It appears that the text originally part of a separate booklet inserted into its current place in the manuscript when the volume was bound.Tschann and Parkes, Facsimile of Digby 86, pp. xliii-xliv Dame Siri√æ is based on a traditional story that has analogue in a number of different languages and that might ultimately have been oriental in origin. As a fabliaux (fablel, 'little story' in the manuscript title), it is bawdy, and the action revolves around a trick (or cointise, 'strategem') played upon one of the characters, an illicit love interest, localized action, and non- aristocratic protagonists. As Bennett and Grey point out, there is very little narrative description in the text; instead, its dynamic is dialogue.Bennett, Middle English Literature, p. 18. Dame Siri√æ might have been performed orally by a poet reading the different roles in a variety of voices with identifiable props; in some ways, then, it could be considered as a proto-dramatic text. This text is written in tailrhyme stanzas, made up of three- or four-beat lines. In the earlier part of the manuscript text, letters placed in the margin indicate a change of speaker in the text; these are the produced Testator (T), Clericus (C), Uxor (U) and Femina (F), representing the narrator, Wilekin, Margery and Dame Siri√æ respectively.As suggested by J.

She was born in Kyiv, but her family moved to Spain when she was two. Both of her parents (Vladimir Dvorak and Flora Khasanova) were also international table tennis players. She won a bronze medal in the women's team event at the 2009 Mediterranean Games in Pescara, Italy. As of May 2019, Dvorak is ranked no. 94 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). Dvorak is a member of the table tennis team for CN Matar√≥, and is coached and trained by Peter Engel, Linus Mernsten, and her mother Flora Khasanova. She is also right-handed, and uses the classic grip. Dvorak made her official debut, as a 20-year-old, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where she competed only in the inaugural women's team event. Playing with Chinese emigrants Shen Yanfei and Zhu Fang, Dvorak placed third in the preliminary pool round, with a total of four points, two defeats from Japan and South Korea, and a single victory over the Australian trio Miao Miao, Jian Fang Lay, and Stephanie Sang Xu. Four years after competing in her first Olympics, Dvorak qualified for her second Spanish team, as a 24-year-old, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, by receiving an allocation spot from the Final World Qualifying Tournament in Doha, Qatar. With a maximum of two quotas per nation in the singles tournament, Dvorak accepted the third spot, and thereby competed only in the women's team event, along with her fellow players Sara Ram√≠rez and Shen Yanfei. Dvorak and her team lost the first round match to the formidable Chinese trio Li Xiaoxia, Guo Yue, and Ding Ning, with a unanimous set score of 0‚Äì3 (4‚Äì11, 7‚Äì11, 12‚Äì14). At the 2016 Summer Olympics, she competed in the women's singles only. She was a replacement for the injured French player Carole Grundisch. She lost to home player Lin Gui in her first match.

Participants include designers, design agencies, communication agencies, brands, packaging manufacturers and design students. History The Pentawards were created by Jean Jacques Evrard and Brigitte Evrard-Lauwereins, both with degrees in design. They created and directed a design agency which joined Carr√© Noir from 1994 to 1998 and subsequently the Desgrippes Gob√© group. At the end of 2006, they left their agency in order to run Pentawards full-time. The purpose of Pentawards is to promote packaging design art globally. The head office of Pentawards is in Brussels, Belgium. Registration and voting Candidates must register on the awards' website and present their creations in detail from the last twelve months by providing standardized visuals. These creations are grouped into categories and presented to the twelve members of the Jury and its President. The jury's vote takes place without the identity of the participants being revealed. The packaging designs are judged in three ways: creativity/innovation ‚Äì impact/branding/communication ‚Äì quality of execution. In each category, the five packaging designs receiving the highest scores are \\"nominated\\". Participants are then asked to provide a physical sample of their nominated packaging (except for concepts). Upon seeing the packaging, the President of the Jury validates and confirms the nomination and prize level obtained: bronze, silver, gold, platinum or diamond. Jury The Jury is composed of thirteen personalities from the world of packaging design including designers or design agency directors and packaging design officials from large commercial brands. The president of the jury is G√©rard Caron, founder of the Carr√© Noir agency and publisher of the Admirable Design. The judging process is supposed to take into account international sensitivities, cultures and markets. Their mandate runs for a maximum of four consecutive years and approximately one third of the jury is renewed every year. To become a member of the jury, candidates must have previously won a Gold, Platinum or Diamond Pentaward. Awards Five levels of awards are given: diamond, platinum, gold, silver, bronze. The diamond award is given to the packaging design which, across all categories, received the highest number of points. The platinum award goes in each of five major categories, to the packaging designs which received the most points in the given category. The gold, silver and bronze awards are given to the best packaging design in each sub-category. The trophies are representations of the Pentawards logo, a circle with a hollow pentagon in the center. They are manufactured with a zinc alloy and after being polished are plated. The \\"diamond\\" is a Swarovski crystal. The trophy was designed and engraved by Belgo-American artist Christian Heckscher.

It was originally a cottage with an attached barn but has now been converted into one long residential building. History It is difficult to determine the exact age of Stumperlowe Cottage, various sources give conflicting dates for its construction and it is possible that the cottage and the cruck barn were constructed at different times. Local historian Bessie Bunker, author of the book ‚ÄúCruck Buildings‚Äù states that the ancient cruck building dates from around 1400. Bunker considered the cottage to be the original Stumperlowe Hall, and was later downgraded to become a labourers cottage and attached barn when the new hall was built in the 1650s by Robert Hall.\\"Cruck Buildings\\", Bessie Bunker, privateley published, , Gives historical details of cruck building. In the 15th century the cottage stood in a completely rural situation with the ancient track between Ecclesall and Hallam Head passing in front of the building, however this was built over in Victorian times as was the farms extensive lands. =Modern times= The cottage was in a ruinous state in 1968 when the last resident of the old building moved out (photograph on Picture Sheffield), the barn had lost its roof and the cruck timbers were open to the elements, the walls were held up by wooden props. Demolition of the ancient cottage seemed certain, however it was saved and protected when it was made a Grade II listed building in September 1970. The cottage was eventually purchased by Mr. & Mrs. D. Millar who were living next door, the Millars took seven years to renovate the building and moved in at Christmas 1993.\\"Sheffield‚Äòs Remarkable Houses\\", Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, , Pages 28/29 Gives historical details of cottage.

Mukerjee) famously known as Sohphlang is a nitrogen fixing herb with characteristic tuberous root, belonging to the genus Flemingia. The root is edible and is a common vegetable in some Asian tribal communities. In addition, it has been traditionally used as an anthelmintic, the basis of which is scientifically validated. It is found as a wild herb along the mountain slopes of Himalayas. It is distributed in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, Nepal and Khasi hills , Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya in Northeast India. It is also sparsely found in Laos, Philippines and Vietnam. Description F. vestita is a perennial herb, having a prostrate but weak stem, measuring about ~60 cm in average. It is highly branched with hairy rhizome and hirsute stems. The roots are tuberous (6 cm or longer). Leaves are pinnately compound with obovate-cuneate leaflets. Leaves are digitately 3-foliolate; and also pubescent like the stem. Lateral leaflets are obliquely elliptic, and slightly smaller. Raceme is axillary or terminal, about 2‚Äì10 cm, and densely pubescent; bracts lanceolate. Calyx is 5-lobed; lobes are linear-lanceolate, lower one is longest, longer than the tube. Corolla is slightly longer than calyx and elliptical. Fruits are hairy sub-cylindrical pods. Seed is globose, brown or black in colour. Flowers are bright-red. It flowers during August and September. Chemical constituents It is rich in bioactive isoflavones such as genistein, daidzein, formononetin and pseudobaptigenin. Uses=VegetableFruit= Sohphlang, Ready to Eat The juicy tuber is a highly priced vegetable among the Garo , Khasi and Jaintia tribes of Meghalaya, India. In fact its demand as foodstuff has increased so much that it has been cultivated as a cash crop and is regularly available in the local markets. The delicate skin is easily peeled off to expose a smooth cream-coloured flesh that has a sweet, nut-like flavour. In terms of nutritional value, it is particularly rich in phosphorus and proteins. =Medicinal= The tuber has been an indigenous vermifuge among the Khasis, to whom it is called soh-phlang. The raw tuber or the root peel is directly consumed for the treatment of soft-bodied intestinal worms. Experimental investigation started in 1996 when the in vitro activity of tuber peel extract was tested against different helminth parasites, including the nematodes such as Ascaris suum, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ascaridia galli, Heterakis gallinarum, a cestode Raillietina echinobothrida and trematodes such as Paramphistomum sp., Artyfechinostomum sufrartyfex and Fasciolopsis buski. In 1991 an isoflavone, genistein was isolated from the tuber extract which was demonstrated to be the major anthelmintic principle, highly potent against trematodes and cestodes. It was further demonstrated effective against the sheep liver fluke Fasciola hepatica and human tapeworms such as Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus metacestodes. =Agriculture= Its property of nitrogen fixation has been put to experimental use. Mixed cropping with F. vestita was found to give better economic returns, mainly due to improved soil fertility with a net gain in nitrogen of up to 250 kg/ha/year.

It covers and is centred on Braunton Burrows, the largest sand dune system (psammosere) in England. The boundaries of the reserve follow the edges of the conjoined catchment basin of the Rivers Taw and the Torridge and stretch out to sea to include the island of Lundy. The biosphere reserve is primarily lowland farmland, and includes many protected sites including 63 Sites of Special Scientific Interest which protect habitats such as culm grassland and broadleaved woodlands. The most populous settlements in its buffer area are Barnstaple, Bideford, Northam, Ilfracombe, and Okehampton. The reserve was the first of the \\"new style\\" of UNESCO biosphere reserves in the United Kingdom when it was expanded from its previous area in 2002. The new guidelines encourage its management to strike a balance between people and conservation of the environment they live in through sustainability, income generation, and a reduction in poverty. It is managed by the Biosphere Reserve Partnership, which includes a number of interested parties such as the Environment Agency, Natural England, Devon Wildlife Trust, and the National Trust. The partnership organises landscape projects and works closely with the inhabitants of the reserve. Within the reserve's core area are the sand dune system and culm grassland. To the west in Bideford Bay (visible from the beach element of the dunes, Saunton Sands which is a due-west facing surfing beach) is a coral reef with a diversity of coral and marine life seen nowhere else in Britain. The sand dunes have a rich habitat of hundreds of flowering plants while the Taw- Torridge estuary is an important feeding area for long-journey migratory birds. The economy of North Devon is largely supported by tourism. Four million people per year visit the area, and visitor numbers can rise as high as 60,000 per day in August. Most of these people come because of the environment.  Geography  North Devon's Biosphere Reserve is in northern Devon in South West England. Although mainly in the districts of North Devon and Torridge, the reserve also extends into West and Mid Devon. It covers a large area of sea up to in depth off the North Devon coast and includes Lundy island from the shore. The core area is centred on Braunton Burrows, a large sand dune system, which consists of of sand dunes, slacks (troughs between the dunes), grassland, scrub habitat, and a part of the Taw-Torridge Estuary. The reserve's boundary follows the edges of several river catchment areas, mainly of the River Taw and the River Torridge, but also those of smaller rivers running into the sea between Hartland and Lynton. The North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty lies at the heart of the reserve, while parts of the national parks of Dartmoor and Exmoor fringe the boundaries. There are no cities within the reserve. Barnstaple, Bideford, Ilfracombe, Braunton, Northam and Great Torrington contain many of the 155,000 people living in the wider buffer area of the Biosphere.http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk 2011 Census The surrounding towns and villages are also included in reserve projects and policy decisions.  History  There is evidence of humans in North Devon from Mesolithic times onward. Worked pieces of flint or stone, known as flint scatters, that date to this era have been found around Baggy Point in an area where flint does not occur naturally. In the clays beneath the sand of Westward Ho! beach there is a Mesolithic midden, a prehistoric dump for domestic waste, composed of mussels, cockles, peppery furrow shells (Scrobicularia plana), and carpet shells (Venerupis spp.). On Exmoor the remains of small flint tools called microliths, used by hunter-gatherers to hunt and prepare animals, have been found and date to the late Mesolithic. In the Neolithic period, people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms, and started to cut down the woodlands of Exmoor, rather than act purely as hunters and gatherers. These Neolithic people created stone monuments and by the Bronze Age were creating barrows (burial mounds) and roundhouses. Evidence shows that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools, weapons, containers and ornaments had started by the Iron Age. Bronze Age barrows have also been found on elevated parts of Bursdon Moor, near Hartland and on Berry Down, near Berrynarbor. Iron Age hill forts were built on prominent parts of the coastline and hinterland. Examples can be found at Hillsborough near Ilfracombe, Embury Beacon and Clovelly Dykes in the Hartland area, with numerous other examples along the coast. Many villages and hamlets may be found within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), most dating back to Saxon times and many recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Grade I-listed remains of medieval architecture can be found in Combe Martin, Berrynarbor and in the hamlet of Stoke, near Hartland. In 1959 the North Devon Coast was designated as an AONB, the first in Devon. In 1976, Braunton Burrows was designated a biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme, with a focus on research questions and on environmental conservation. The reserve was greatly expanded in 2002 under a new set of guidelines that promoted the interactions of mankind with nature in terms of sustainable living, income generation, and reducing local poverty. It became the first of these \\"new style\\" biosphere reserves in the United Kingdom. The dune system of Braunton Burrows was re-designated as the core area of the biosphere reserve under the revised goals. Since its recognition, the AONB had no management service until the early 1990s when a Heritage Coast Service was formed to manage two defined Heritage Coasts which have similar boundaries to the AONB, the Hartland Heritage Coast and the North Devon Heritage Coast. This service went through a number of name and remit changes, first renamed as the Northern Devon Coast and Countryside Service, and then as the North Devon AONB and Biosphere Service. The establishment of the North Devon AONB Partnership in 2004 led to the service being split to become two separate entities, the North Devon AONB Service and the North Devon Biosphere Service.  Management  UNESCO sets out three functions of a biosphere reserve: conservation, learning and research, and sustainable development. Biosphere reserves aim to create and maintain sustainable communities where people can live and work in an area of high environmental quality; these areas can then provide a blueprint for other areas to learn from. The reserve must be environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. To achieve this, the reserve oversees management of natural resources, initiatives to develop the local economy, and an effort to reduce inequalities between people. = Biosphere Reserve Partnership = Clean-up of the River Taw is part of an improvement scheme organised by the partnership. The management of the biosphere reserve is undertaken, on behalf of local authorities and stakeholders, by North Devon's Biosphere Reserve Partnership. The group is composed of a number of interested parties including the Ministry of Defence, Devon County Council, the Environment Agency, Natural England, some educational institutions, national park authorities, representatives from northern Devon commerce and industry, local farmers and fishermen, Devon Wildlife Trust, and the National Trust. The partnership was formed to encourage cooperation between the relevant local authorities in fulfilling their commitments to North Devon's Biosphere Reserve. The partnership is required by the statutory framework for biosphere reserves, the UNESCO Seville 95 Strategy, to develop vision and strategies for the effective functioning of the reserve. Its remit includes several large- scale projects which have been developed through the partnership. A¬£1.8 million improvement project along the River Taw, funded by the Environment Agency, is designed to decrease polluted surface runoff from fields and urban areas into the river. The project will restore habitats and remove obstacles such as weirs which prevent animals from freely moving between sections of the river. The decrease in pollution is also hoped to increase beach quality in places such as Instow, which failed water quality tests in 2012, one of only sixteen beaches in the South West to fail. A Nature Improvement Area proposed to protect and enhance the catchment of the River Torridge‚Äîhome of Tarka the Otter in Henry Williamson's book of the same name‚Äîwas chosen by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as one of twelve nationally important landscapes which will receive funding to restore and recreate ecosystems in the area. Other large projects work to use the natural environment to offset the negative impacts of human activities within the Biosphere. = Farming = The predominant farm type in Devon is livestock farming, which includes dairy, lowland cattle, and sheep farms. In 2006, the total labour force on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, but is not designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully with the cooperation of farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from nonpoint source pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This is one of the most pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by fine soil particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, and have a good role within the community.  Ecology  North Devon's Biosphere Reserve contains many nationally important habitats including culm grassland (Molinia caerulea and Juncus spp.), broadleaved woodlands, estuaries, and coastal heathland. A 10-year Biodiversity Action Plan for the reserve identifies actions that can be carried out by the partnership to help nature conservation, learning, and research. It also contains 63 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), 671 County Wildlife Sites, a Special Area of Conservation, and six Local Nature Reserves. The Braunton Burrows core area consists of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting a wide variety of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and white horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round- leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK. Behind the dunes, grassland, or dune pasture, supports a variety of grasses, sedges and herbs including rough poppy (Papaver hybridum) and toothed medick (Medicago lupulina). Scrub invasion occurs with native species such as willows, privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and common blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and introduced species such as sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides). The scrub and grazed vegetation supports lichens such as the sausage lichen (Usnea articulata) and scrambled-egg lichen (Fulgensia fulgens), and around 60 species are found in the compacted soils. The common dormouse is the only species of dormouse native to Great Britain. Braunton Burrows, along with the Taw-Torridge Estuary (also an SSSI), is a main route for bird migration along the west coast of Great Britain. Waterfowl winter on the shores of the sea and estuary, while the coastline supports a variety of breeding species such as whitethroats (Sylvia communis) and magpies (Pica pica) in the scrub; skylarks (Alaunda arvensis) and meadow pipits (Anthus pratensis) in the grassland; and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) and shelducks (Tadorna tadorna) in holes or burrows. Invertebrates are abundant throughout the dune system, which includes 30 species of terrestrial or freshwater molluscs, including the sandbowl snail (Catinella arenaria), which is only known in two sites in the UK. The characteristic and notable species outside the core area include sea purslane (Halimione portulacoides), Salicornia spp., pea crabs that live inside mussels, lugworm, Hydrobia snails, and annual seablite (Suaeda maritima) in estuarine and saltmarsh habitats; common reed (Phragmites australis), creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), common rush (Juncus effusus), and fat duckweed (Lemna gibba) in the low and grazing marshland of the floodplains; and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), and creeping bentgrass in mixed farmland. The reserve also contains nationally rare mammals such as the common dormouse and the European otter, the marsh fritillary butterfly, and coral reef off Lundy Island found nowhere else.  Activities  The South West Coast Path follows the North Devon Coast past these cliffs at Clovelly. North Devon's Biosphere Reserve in its wider definition attracts a large number of visitors each year. Four million people a year visit, up to 60,000 a day in August. Northern Devon receives around 1.4 million visitors during the year who stay within the reserve and contribute over ¬£250 million to the area's economy. Surveys show that 80% of these visit because of the environment. Walking and hiking opportunities attract a large number of people to North Devon's Biosphere Reserve. There are footpaths throughout the national parks of Exmoor and Dartmoor, and the South West Coast Path stretches along the whole of the north coast of the reserve from Welcombe to Lynton. In 2003 research indicated that the South West Coast Path brought around ¬£300 million a year in total to the South West, which could support more than 7,500 jobs. This research also recorded that 27.6% of visitors to the region came because of the Path, and they spent ¬£136 million in a year. Local people took 23 million walks on the Path and spent a further ¬£116 million, and other visitors contributed the remainder. A further study in 2005 estimated this figure to have risen to around ¬£300 million. Other popular attractions include surfing, the Tarka Trail, Northam Burrows Country Park, Rosemoor Garden, and Watermouth Castle.

That was based on the facts the M√©tis had been considered Aboriginals in Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, that non-status Indians were those descended from Indians to whom the Indian Act did not apply, and that the government's refusal to recognize those groups meant that they have been discriminated against.Daniels, para. 4 The defendants argued that there were insufficient facts for a declaration to be issued, that M√©tis had never been considered Indians, and that there was not a group known as \\"non-status Indians.\\" They denied allegations of discrimination.Daniels, para. 5 They claimed that issuing any declaration requested by the plaintiffs would lead only to more litigation.Daniels, para. 53 =Opinion= The Federal Court agreed to the first declaration but dismissed the other two.Daniels, paras. 20 and 619 It determined that such a declaration was along the lines recommended by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal People.Daniels, para. 59 It found that the overarching purposes of the Constitution Act, 1867 were settlement, expansion and development of the Dominion; that building a transcontinental railroad was integral to those purposes, that section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867,the power over \\"Indians,\\" was related to these purposes, that by section 91(24) the Framers of the Constitution Act, 1867 intended to give themselves adequate power to deal with any and all situations involving indigenous people that could frustrate these purposes and accordingly the power over \\"Indians\\" at section 91(24) was large enough to deal with all Aboriginal people, including the M√©tis of the West. The court found support for that interpretation in the fact that M√©tis had been recognized as \\"Indians\\" under the Secretary of State Act, 1868.Daniels, paras. 362‚Äì364 He agreed that the definition of \\"Indian\\" in the Indian Act was narrower than the one found in section 91(24).Daniels, para. 551 =Appeals= On 6 February 2013, the Canadian government appealed the ruling.

Supreme Court In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court restored the trial judge's declaration on the first issue, as it settled a \\"live controversy.\\" However, it agreed that there was no \\"practical utility\\" in issuing the other declarations, as those questions \\"would be a restatement of the existing law.\\"SCC, par. 53, 56 It did so because: :* Delgamuukw v British Columbia had already accepted that Canada‚Äôs Aboriginal peoples had a fiduciary relationship with the Crown, and Manitoba Metis Federation Inc v Canada (AG) accepted that such a relationship exists between the Crown and M√©tis.SCC, par. 53 :* Haida Nation v British Columbia (Minister of Forests), Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia and R v Powley already recognized a context-specific duty to negotiate when Aboriginal rights are engaged.SCC, par. 56 The fact that federal jurisdiction exists in the matter does not necessarily invalidate any provincial legislation, as the Supreme Court had held in Canadian Western Bank v Alberta that it \\"favour[s], where possible, the ordinary operation of statutes enacted by both levels of government.\\"SCC, par. 51, quoting Canadian Western Bank, par. 37 =Impact= The Supreme Court's characterization of M√©tis as being equivalent to \\"M√©tis-as-mixed\\" appeared to represent a reversal of its ruling in Powley.

Eevo Boscar√≥l; ), born 15 April 1956, is the founder and CEO of Pipistrel, a producer of ultralight and light aircraft, based in Ajdov≈°ƒçina, Slovenia. Boscarol is most known as an aircraft designer and entrepreneur.  Early career  Boscarol was born in 1956 in Postojna, Slovenia, at the time also part of Yugoslavia. His father Augusto Boscarol, a machine engineer, spent several young years as a test pilot at the Aermacchi, an Italian aircraft manufacturer. Family lived in Ajdov≈°ƒçina, a town in western Slovenia near which a small military airfield was located. After elementary and high school in Ajdov≈°ƒçina Boscarol studied economy at the University of Ljubljana. From 1976 to 1986 he was involved in publishing, owned a studio, in photography (official photographer at the ≈†entjakobsko gledali≈°ƒçe theatre in Ljubljana 1976‚Äì1980), was an advertising manager of the student radio station in Ljubljana (1976‚Äì1978), a manager of several musicians and rock bands. Boscarol also organized several art photo exhibitions, including nudes. He introduced the badge concept and mass production to Yugoslavia, at the time unfamiliar in the country. Pipistrel Virus SW 912 IS ultra-light airplane  Pipistrel  In the eighties of the past century the era of hang gliding and powered hang gliding arrived and Boscarol, though flying private aircraft of any kind was not legal, started an own private business, Boscarol studio, a small-scale production of motorized hang gliders, mainly for customers in the neighboring Italy. He had to test his prototypes, first hang gliders, later ultra-lightairplanes, and to avoid too much attention he flew between dusk and darkness. The flying times and shape of the wings earned the aircraft the nickname \\"pipistrel\\", a word locals use in dialect for bat. It is derived from Italian pipistrello. Boscarol used the word to name his new company, Pipistrel. After a struggling first decade the markets began to open up following the exhibition of Pipistrel Sinus ultra- light aircraft at the 1995 AERO Friedrichshafen European general aviation trade show. Commitment to light designs and fuel efficiency, possible especially in the category of motor gliders paved the way to wide recognition of the company and his ideas. Assembled engine on a light-sport aircraft in the Pipistrel Ajdov≈°ƒçina factory Most visible was the successful participation at several NASA Centennial Challenges, prize contests aimed at engaging the public at large to help advance the aeronautic and space technologies. It began with the 2007 NASA Personal Air Vehicle (PAV) Challenge competition (Pipistrel Virus) and was followed in 2008, when the event was renamed to NASA General Aviation Technology Challenge (GAT). The most important of all was the participation at the Google-sponsored 2011 NASA Green Flight Challenge (GFC) competition with a $1,350.000 main prize, the largest in aviation history. Competition rules asked for an aviation breakthrough. The competing aircraft were required to fly in less than two hours; reach an average speed of at least ; take off at a distance of less than to clear a obstacle; deliver a decibel rating of less than 78 dBA at full-power takeoff while using less than of gasoline per occupant. 10 planes entered the competition, 3 of them actually flew and only 2 met the above requirements. The contest-winning Taurus G4 electric plane was of an unconventional design, with two fuselages and a large () motor in between. Such a design was required to accommodate the over of lithium-ion polymer batteries, nearly half the weight of a plane. The development of this aircraft, led by Tine Tomazic, 5 months from concept to production was achieved using high performance computing (HPC) technologies including computational fluid dynamics. It won the 2014 HPC Innovation Excellence Award.

It succeeded the Energy Act 2010. The Act focuses on setting decarbonisation targets for the UK, and reforming the electricity market. The Act was intended by Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey to \\"attract investment to bring about a once-in-a- generation transformation of our electricity market\\". History The Energy Bill was introduced by the government in the House of Commons for first reading on 29 November 2012, and passed a vote at third reading with cross- party support on 4 June 2013. The Bill received Royal Assent on 18 December 2013. Aims The Act aims to maintain a stable electricity supply as coal- fired power stations are retired. This includes facilitating the building of a new set of nuclear power stations and the establishment of a new regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. The Act proposes a delay in setting decarbonisation targets under the Climate Change Act 2008, until 2016. Businesses and analysts have criticised the uncertainty this causes for investors, notably Balfour Beatty and Ernst & Young. Conservative MP Tim Yeo and Labour MP Barry Gardiner tabled amendments to the Bill to reinsert a 2030 decarbonisation target for the power sector by 2014. The Act also enables the government to privatise the Government Pipelines and Storage System.

Operated by the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de fer fran√ßais (SNCF), it was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (TEE) until 1984 and then a two-class Rapide until discontinued, circa 1990. The train was named after the region of Aquitaine, of which Bordeaux is the capital. Route=Core route= The Aquitaine's core route was the long Paris‚ÄìBordeaux railway. Initially, the train ran non-stop, but by the time it was discontinued, it had the following stops: * Bordeaux-Saint-Jean ‚Äì Angoul√™me ‚Äì Poitiers ‚Äì Saint-Pierre-des-Corps ‚Äì Paris-Austerlitz =Variation= Starting in late 1984, the Aquitaines northbound route was extended to start in Hendaye on Mondays only (except holidays). On other operating days, Tuesdays through Fridays, the train still started in Bordeaux. Southbound trips continued to terminate in Bordeaux on Mondays through Thursdays, but on Fridays (except holidays) were extended to Pau, and in autumn 1986 extended farther, to Tarbes (still on Fridays only). History The train was introduced on 23 May 1971, as a counterpart to another named train, the √âtendard, a Rapide that had been running on the same route, in the opposite direction (i.e. Paris‚ÄìBordeaux‚ÄìParis), since 1968. In its first two years of operation, the Aquitaine departed from Bordeaux-Saint-Jean as TEE 2 at 07:15 and reached Paris-Austerlitz at 11:25; the return Aquitaine, TEE 1, left Paris at 17:55 and arrived in Bordeaux at 21:55. The Aquitaine was aimed at business travellers, and therefore did not run on Saturdays, nor during the high season. At the start of the winter 1971/72 timetable, the √âtendard was upgraded to TEE status, as TEE 5/4. This meant that on weekdays two TEE trains, the Aquitaine and the √âtendard, served the same route in each direction. From the summer 1973 timetable onwards, the morning Aquitaine departed 45 minutes later. In the summer of 1981, both the morning and evening Aquitaine services began stopping in Angoul√™me. In the winter of 1981/82, another stop, in Poitiers, was added to both services, and the morning train also began stopping in Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. In the summer of 1982, the Saint-Pierre-des-Corps stop was added to the timetable of the evening train. These additional stops did not overcome waning demand for the Aquitaine. For the winter 1983/84 timetable, the morning train was rescheduled to depart Bordeaux half an hour later, and the days of operation of both services were cut back: the morning train became a Tuesday to Friday service, and the evening train was reduced to Mondays to Thursdays. At the next timetable change, the Aquitaine was downgraded to a two-class InterCity/Rapide train,\\"Summer services, 1984\\" (changes taking effect).

He was the eldest son of Vincent Novello, and the creator of Novello and Company Ltd as a revolutionary force in music publishing. Life J. Alfred Novello was born in London, the eldest son of the famous organist and composer Vincent Novello, who was the father of eleven children; two died in infancy, two survived infancy but died in childhood, and a son died in early manhood. One son and five daughters survived to carry on the family musical tradition. In 1811 Vincent Novello founded the music publishing firm Novello & Co which carries his name, as he issued sheet music on a subscription basis from his own house and continued to do so until his son J. Alfred Novello took over the business in 1829 at the early age of nineteen. Before this business venture, Alfred, as a bass singer, had done some professional singing. Alfred Novello promoted and built the business into a huge commercial success, and is credited as being the first to introduce inexpensive sheet music (reducing the retail price by a factor of four)A brief history of Novello and Co Ltd and to depart from the method of publishing by subscription. In 1836 Novello started the publication of The Musical World, a weekly periodical that was the first devoted to music; its publication continued until 1891.The Musical World (London, 1836‚Äì1891) from Retrospective Index to Music Periodicals (ripm.org) From 1841 Henry Littleton assisted him, becoming a partner in 1861, when the firm became Novello & Co., and, on Alfred Novello's retirement and the completion of the sale in 1866, sole proprietor. Having incorporated the firm of Ewer & Co. in 1867, the title was changed to Novello, Ewer & Co., and still later back to Novello & Co., and, on Henry Littleton's death in 1888, his two sons carried on the business. Before his retirement, Alfred Novello actively worked against British \\"taxation of knowledge\\" and played a significant role in the 1853 repeal of the advertisement duty, the 1855 repeal of the newspaper stamp,The campaign for a free Press ‚Äî The Peel Web, A Web of English History (Dr Marjorie Bloy)Taxes on Knowledge ‚Äî Spartacus Educational repeal of duties on paper and foreign books, and repeal of the security system.In reply to an email query as to what is meant by \\"repeal of the security system\\", Dr. Marjorie Bloy replied on 26 Feb 2013, giving a reference to Collet Dobson Collet's book A History of the Taxes on Knowledge: https://archive.org/stream/historyofthetaxe035181mbp/historyofthetaxe035181mbp_djvu.txt. This is a book; you need chapter 21, if you're going to read it ... If you aren't, then the short answer is that it refers to the Six Acts of 1819 which levied a tax on newspapers. I gather that newspapers had to be registered under a security by the proprietor and it was this which was abolished. Newspaper proprietors had to give a \\"security\\" against libel in the period of distress/riots etc. immediately after the French Wars. The House of Lords debate says \\"The principle of the present Bill was to repeal the Acts of Parliament which required securities of publishers and printers, and to preserve the Acts of Parliament which insisted on the registration of newspapers at Somerset House.\\" He was a friend of Henry Bessemer. After his retirement from the music publishing business, Alfred Novello moved to Genoa and pursued his interests in the Italian Irrigation Company, playing and composing organ music, and the study of hydrodynamics. He obtained several patents on ship construction and worked with William Froude. He died in Genoa.

The International Communist Current (ICC) is a left communist international organisation, headquartered in Paris, France. It was founded in 1975, and has published an international quarterly in English and French from that date. Subsequently, a Spanish edition has also been made available. Pre-history=Marc Chirik= One of the key figures in the formation of the ICC was Marc Chirik, one of the founders of the Palestinian Communist Party at the age of 13.Pierre Hempel, Marc Laverne, p16. Arriving in France in 1924, Chirik was expelled from the French Communist Party shortly afterwards, at the same time as Albert Treint,Vie de Treint, http://www.collectif- smolny.org/article.php3?id_article=292 and with latter participated in the short-lived \\"Ligue Communiste\\".Hempel, p35 In 1935 he joined the \\"Bilan\\" group of the \\"Italian Fraction of the Communist Party\\" based in Paris. Mobilised briefly during the \\"Phoney War\\", and imprisoned by the Germans after the collapse of the French armies, Chirik managed to escape to Marseille where he spent the rest of the war. In 1941, under the difficult and dangerous conditions first of the Vichy regime, then of the German occupation, Chirik was one of a small group of militants from the Italian Fraction, who had escaped to Marseille and managed little by little to renew contacts with others in Belgium and Paris.Hempel, p59 In 1942, a \\"French Fraction of the Communist Left\\" was formed alongside the Italian Fraction, with Chirik's encouragement. Disagreements with the majority of the Italian Fraction as to how to react to the uprisings in Italy at the end of World War II led Chirik to join the French Fraction in 1945, the latter transforming itself into the \\"Gauche Communiste de France\\" (Communist Left in France) in the same year. The GCF was to publish a newspaper (L'Etincelle) and a theoretical review (Internationalisme) between 1945 and 1952.Smolny presentation of Internationalisme http://www.collectif-smolny.org/article.php3?id_article=521 In 1952, the GCF (fearing an outbreak of a new world war as a result of the conflict in Korea) decided to disperse its handful of militants around the world, and Chirik left France for Venezuela; with his departure, the GCF went into decline and disappeared. = May 1968 and the formation of R√©volution Internationale = It was not until 1963 that Chirik was able to form around him a new group, essentially made up of students, which began to publish Internacionalismo in 1965 and developed correspondence with other groups around the world, notably News and Letters in the United States, and the short-lived Mouvement pour l'instauration des conseils created in Toulouse in 1968 and which began publishing R√©volution Internationale in 1969.Bourseiller, p206 The group quickly achieved a certain notoriety. However, the Situationist International criticised them for intellectual dishonesty.On libcom, http://libcom.org/library/internationale-situationiste-12-article-4 In 1970, Chirik returned definitively to France and joined the RI group. The early 1970s was a period of intense discussion amongst a whole series of groups in the process of rediscovering the heritage of what was known as left communism. RI took an active part in the process, participating regularly in the meetings of Informations et Correspondances Ouvri√®res.Bourseiller, p458 In June 1972, a conference in Clermont Ferrand decided on the merger of RI, the Cahiers du Communisme de Conseils from Marseille, and the Organisation conseilliste de Clermont Ferrand. Foundation of the ICC, 1975 International discussions took place between RI and several other groups: World Revolution, a break away group from Solidarity in Great Britain,Recollections of my time in Solidarity Accessed 3 October 2018 Internationalism (United States), Internacionalismo (Venezuela), and Accion Proletaria (Spain) led to the formation in 1975 of the International Communist Current, which published the first issue of its International Review in April 1975. The following year, a minority faction of the Communist Workers Organisation joined World Revolution (UK). In 1976, the ICC held its first international congress; among the participants was Jan Appel, a veteran of the German Revolution and the 1920 Ruhr Uprising. In the years that followed, contact was also opened up with Onorato Damen of the Partito Comunista Internazionalista in Italy, and with Cajo Brendel of Daad en Gedachte in the Netherlands.Bourseiller, p463-464 In 1981, a group of members, mostly based in Scotland, split from World Revolution (UK) to form the Communist Bulletin Group. At Marc Chirik's death in 1990, having given his last 15 years to the organisation, the ICC published a brief summary of his life.http://en.internationalism.org/ir/065/marc-01http://en.internationalism.org/ir/066/marc-02 Political positions and intervention The ICC claims to have created a \\"synthesis\\" of the different elements of the left communist tradition, in particular those targeted by Lenin in his famous Left Wing Communism, an infantile disorder: against participation in parliament or the trades unions, and against \\"entryism\\" into the Social Democratic, Labour, Communist or Trotskyist parties.http://en.internationalism.org/basic-positions However, at the same time they reject varieties of councilism which reject the Russian Revolution, saying that they express \\"a movement away from the conceptions of revolutionary marxism\\".Contribution to a history of the revolutionary movement: Introduction to the Dutch-German Left accessed 14 January 2012 The \\"Basic Positions\\" published on the back of every ICC publication define the organisation's activity as follows: *\\"Political and theoretical clarification of the goals and methods of the proletarian struggle, of its historic and its immediate conditions. *Organised intervention, united and centralised on an international scale, in order to contribute to the process which leads to the revolutionary action of the proletariat. *The regroupment of revolutionaries with the aim of constituting a real world communist party, which is indispensable to the working class for the overthrow of capitalism and the creation of a communist society.\\" From the beginning, the ICC attached considerable importance to the republication and critique of texts from the workers' movement.Authier and Barrot's La Gauche Communiste en Allemagne mentions the critique of Daad en Gedachte published in the second issue of the International Review http://en.internationalism.org/node/2511 Over the years, it has published a number of books and texts including: * A history of the British Communist LeftCited in Spartacus educational resources: https://spartacus-educational.com/TUbsp.htm * A history of the Russian Communist LeftCited in (recent issues of the International Review have included a previously unavailable complete edition of a document by Gavril Myasnikovhttp://en.internationalism.org/series/1237) * A history of the left wing of the Turkish Communist Party The ICC's conception of practical activity within the day-to-day struggles of the working class was set out in a \\"Reply to our critics\\".http://en.internationalism.org/node/2748 The organisation's French section was heavily involved in the steelworkers' struggle in 1979.Bourseiller, p479 In November 2010, the ICC joined people advocating the use of \\"legitimate force\\" to stop a rise in tuition fees at British universities to mobilise school children. At least one ICC member attended a planning meeting of the Education Activist Network campaign group. The ICC has defined itself as anti-freemasonry, stating that \\"As exploiting classes, these enemies of the proletariat necessarily employ secrecy and deception both against each other and against the working class.\\" Publications The ICC continues to publish its theoretical quarterly International Review in English, French, and Spanish. It publishes regular agitational articles (in its printed press and/or on its web site), in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Tagalog, and Portuguese. It also publishes less regularly, or occasionally, in Russian, Hindi, Bengali, Korean, Persian, Japanese and Swedish.

The origins of the group lay in the Socialist Labour Party (SLP). The SLP was a De Leonist group, but in support of the October Revolution, it decided to participate in unity negotiations with the other British communist groups ‚Äì principally the British Socialist Party (BSP) and the Workers Socialist Federation (WSF). To this end, it formed a Unity Committee in January 1919. This committee included many prominent members of the SLP: Tom Bell, Arthur McManus, J. T. Murphy and William Paul, all of them proponents of a united communist party. The main difficulty in the negotiations was the BSP ‚Äì the largest group ‚Äì were affiliated to the Labour Party and wished any new communist party to be so, or at least that former BSP members could maintain their individual affiliations, a position vehemently opposed by the SLP and WSF. As discussions broke down, the Unity Committee proposed that the issue could be avoided by holding a vote on Labour Party affiliation one year after the formation of a communist party, reasoning that once the party was formed, BSP members would conclude they did not need to remain part of Labour. Not only was this proposal unsuccessful, but the SLP executive publicly repudiated and dissolved the Unity Committee, and decided against further unity negotiations. The main figures of the Unity Committee ‚Äì with the exception of Murphy ‚Äì continued to attend the unity negotiations unofficially, and in April 1920 they organised a separate conference alongside the SLP conference. This event was not well attended, but the Committee had now moved in opposition to the SLP and directed the conference to constitute itself as the Communist Unity Group. The CUG adopted a policy of negotiated unity with parliamentary agitation but opposition to the Labour Party. A small number of SLP branches joined the CUG, but the group drew fewer members than they had hoped. However, around two thirds of its members were from the SLP. The group attended the unity convention which formed the Communist Party of Great Britain on 1 August 1920. Although the convention approved Labour Party affiliation by 100 votes to 85, the CUG joined the CPGB, initially becoming its second largest component.

In the same month, the Communist Party of South Wales and the West of England was founded, with a very similar programme. Under the influence of John Maclean MA, the group was provisionally named the Scottish Communist Party.

It also decided that it should remain a provisional body with the aim of joining the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), a position championed by Willie Gallacher.

The league is organized on the party pattern. Its leader is its First Secretary, who is an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The current First Secretary (appointed June 2018) is He Junke (born February 1969). The Communist Youth League is responsible also for guiding the activities of the Young Pioneers (for children below the age of fifteen).  History  Founded in May 1920, it was originally named as the Socialist Youth League of China. Whilst the Party was officially established in July 1921, the Chinese Socialist Youth League was organized with the Party being set up throughout the country. In May 1922, the 1st National Congress () of the League was held under the leadership of the Party, and therefore became a unified organization in China. In the 3rd National Congress in January 1925, the Chinese Socialist Youth League was renamed as the Chinese Communist Youth League. After the Sino-Japanese War, in order to adapt to the new social and political situation, it was officially renamed as the Chinese New Democracy Youth League in April 1949. Later in May 1957, its name as the Chinese Communist Youth League was resumed, historically combining the congresses of all three leagues (the Chinese Socialist Youth League, the Chinese Communist Youth League as well as the Chinese New Democracy Youth League). During the 10 years of the Cultural Revolution, the functioning of the League was blocked and the Central Committee was disbanded as it was accused of revisionism; its functions were partly resumed in the early 1970s. From 1978 to 2008, six congresses were held. The Communist Youth League has contributed a number of top echelon leaders of the Communist Party-led government of the People's Republic of China. The proliferation of leaders with a Youth League background has led to the informal name \\"Youth League faction\\" being used to describe certain members of the leadership at different times. The first \\"Youth League faction\\" was represented by Hu Yaobang (party chairman 1981-1982, party general secretary 1982-1987 following the abolition of the chairman position). The second \\"Youth League faction\\" is represented by Hu Jintao (General secretary 2002-2012, President 2003-2013). While there is no direct political lineage between the two Hus, Hu Jintao's administration has formally elevated the memory of the earlier Hu. In 2005, the 90th anniversary of Hu Yaobang's birth, a new museum and a series of commemorative books and television programs were launched. The scandalous death of the son of Ling Jihua and Gu Liping, a couple associated with the Communist Youth League, may have tarnished the reputation of the organization as a path to power. Current General Secretary Xi Jinping has sought to reduce the prominence of the Communist Party's youth wing, stating that \\"All they [cadres] can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk\\". Political commentators have noted that the diminishing of the Communist Youth League faction curtailed the influence of former paramount leader Hu Jintao, solidifying Xi's own political faction.

She is known for being a \\"human letter\\" sent by the suffragettes to the Prime Minister.  Life  Elspeth was born on 20 May 1879 in Keighley, Yorkshire to John McClelland, an accountant, and Epsey McClelland (n√©e Robinson). She was baptised in Ilkley on 19 July the same year. Elspeth trained as an architect, the only female student among 600 men at the Polytechnic Architectural School in London, and has been described as the first woman to practice as an architect, although this is unlikely to be quite accurate. Architectural drawings show that she was working as an architect by 1904. She became a suffragette in the 1900s, married William Albert Spencer in 1912 and moved to Whitchurch Lane, Edgware. Elspeth had three children before dying in childbirth in 1920. According to her family, she was given a silver tea service by the queen in recognition of her contribution to women's causes. This was sold by her husband after her death.  Suffragette  McClelland's time as a suffragette is best known for when she was sent as a \\"human letter\\" to the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, on 23 February 1909. At this time Post Office regulations had been relaxed to allow individuals to be \\"posted\\" by express messenger, so McClelland and fellow suffragette Daisy Solomon were dispatched by Jessie Kenney and \\"Christabel Pankhurst from Clement's Inn and were taken by Mrs. Drummond to the East Strand Post Office\\". Daisy Dorothea Solomon was from South Africa and she was the daughter of another suffragette Georgiana Solomon.Elizabeth van Heyningen, ‚ÄòSolomon , Georgiana Margaret (1844‚Äì1933)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2006 accessed 17 Nov 2017 They were addressed to \\"The Right Hon H. H. Asquith, 10 Downing Street, SW\\". For the price of a threepenny stamp, A.S. Palmer, a telegraph messenger boy, delivered them to Downing Street, where the policemen on duty allowed them through to number 10. At that point, an official came out and \\"notwithstanding the ladies' protest that they had been 'paid for', said 'you cannot be delivered here. You must be returned; you are dead letters'\\". Elspeth and Daisy were returned to the offices of the Women's Social and Political Union. The Prime Minister was said to have been \\"amused\\" by the incident. The front-page photo from the Daily Mirror can be seen on The British Postal Museum & Archive Website. In September 1913 Mrs Elspeth Spencer placed a classified ad in the suffragette newspaper Votes for Women (p. 732) describing herself: 'Architect of uncommon houses and cottages. Furniture and decorations in suffrage colours designed and executed. Apply Studio A, 22 Blomfield Road, Kensington.'  Architect  There are conflicting reports about Elspeth's time as an architect. According to Atkinson, \\"McClelland had been the only woman among 600 male students at the Polytechnic Architectural School in London, and became the first woman to practice as an architect\\". However, records at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) indicate that its first female member was Ethel Mary Charles in 1898, when Elspeth would have been 19. The Polytechnic Architectural School has been absorbed into the University of Westminster. They do not have complete records for the likely dates of Elspeth's study. What they do show is Elspeth passing a Senior Commercial Education Certificate in book-keeping in the London Chamber of Commerce Examinations, 1911. Some facts about her career are clear from surviving architectural drawings and other records. Cottage Design by McClelland in 1905. 'The Ideal Cottage for the Society of Artists' - Winning cottage design for 106 Wilbury Road Most of her drawings are undated, although one shows a date (1904) above the door. Several of her properties are in Letchworth, the one at 106 Wilbury Road having been designed as part of a competition to design a ¬£150 cottage. According to Victoria Rawlings, Curator ‚Äì Collections at the First Garden City Heritage Museum, \\"In 1905 strict planning regulations meant that in rural areas, the cost of building a cottage would be more than the tenant could afford to pay in rent. This and other factors were adding to 'urban drift', whereby many agricultural workers were forced to move to the towns. A Mr J St Loe Strachey, editor of The Spectator newspaper, put forth a proposal that an exhibition of ¬£150 cottages should be held. This challenge was taken up by First Garden City Ltd as, at the new town of Letchworth, rural bye-laws would not be applicable. \\"Amongst the 85, otherwise male entrants to the competition, was Miss Elspeth McClelland, who designed and supervised the building of a cottage for the Society of Artists. This group was, in Miss McClelland's own words: 'A Society of Women Decorators who have sometimes felt that architects do not study the requirements from a woman's point of view'. Many newspapers ran articles extolling the virtues of what one paper called, 'The house that Jill built'. \\"Elspeth Cottage, as it was named, was built in concrete with a timber surround giving the look of an old English style but with modern materials. Miss McClelland also designed much of the interior furniture herself in a traditional cottage style. However, she was keen to point out the cottage was not merely an aesthetic venture, stating that: 'Much of the working women's time is spent in the scullery and I am therefore making it a bright and cheerful room with two windows instead of a dismal back kitchen'. The coals and the toilet in this period were usually accessed through an outside door but Miss McClelland placed them with access from the inside and a covered porch, again making life easier for the housewife.\\" Elspeth gave talks on this design, for example, that reported by the Standard on 22 June 1905: \\"'A Cottage for ¬£150' was the alluring title of an interesting lecture which Miss Elspeth McClelland gave yesterday at the Women's Institute, Victoria Street, W. Many people in better circumstances than working men might covet the charming little country cottages, the construction of which Miss McClelland explained in detail, and remarked that such sound, well-constructed little houses were admirable investments.\\" In the same month, The Estates Gazette reported that \\"A member of the fair sex has come forward as a practical advocate of cheap houses for the working classes in country districts. On Wednesday last, at the Institute, Miss E. McClelland delivered an interesting lecture, entitled ‚ÄòA Cottage for ¬£150,‚Äô in the course of which she demonstrated to the satisfaction of an attentive audience that her designs combined comfort, economy and artistic consideration.\\" Elspeth not only designed houses, but also the fabrics and furniture to suit them. The Daily Express described her as \\"a young lady of many talents. After building a house for her clients, she will design wall papers, carpets, mantelpiece, and even furniture, to suit the rooms.\\", while The Lady's Pictorial wrote that \\"to Miss McClelland we owe the opening of another field for women‚Äôs work\\". If not supporting the claim that she was the first woman to practice as an architect, this indicates that there were few others.

Like many youth of that period, he was involved in one of the Socialist Zionist youth movements. At the age of 18 he joined the Palmach, the newly created Jewish paramilitary defense organization, as Palestine was becoming threatened by Rommel's rapid advance across North Africa. After Rommel's defeat in 1943 however, Peled was involved in various acts against the continuing British rule. He served in the Palmach's Jerusalem Platoon together with Yitzhak Rabin, with whom Peled was to maintain lifelong contact. War of independence In 1946 Peled started law studies in London, but the outbreak of civil war, following the Partition of Palestine brought him back to the military. With the ensuing 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War (Israeli war of Independence/Palestinian Nakba) in May, he was among the cadre of militia officers who became the backbone of the newly founded Israeli Defence Forces, as the newly created state of Israel had to transform its collection of militias into a single, full-fledged, regular army, in the midst of heavy fighting on multiple fronts. With many still in their twenties, Peled and his fellow-officers were often entrusted with highly responsible positions, which in most armies are entrusted to older and far more experienced officers. As the military commander of the Jerusalem region following the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Peled participated in a single project to resettle Palestinian refugees, in which a small group of villagers were allowed to cross the Green Line from the Jordanian-held West Bank back into Israel; this act was a marked exception to the government's policy of outright rejecting the return of Palestinian refugees. These refugees, however, were not allowed to return to their original village‚ÄîEin Neqova west of Jerusalem‚Äîbut were resettled at a nearby location, the village of Ein Rafa. Peled, an officer with wide-ranging intellectual interests, was marked early-on as a potential staff officer and in the early 1950s was sent to study at the British Staff and Command College, together with Rabin and others, who later held senior positions in the IDF over the following decades. During his stay in Britain, Peled met and befriended some Jordanian officers, who also had been sent there; some of these officers were to gain senior positions in their own, opposing military. Military commander of Gaza Peled served as the military commander of Gaza during the half-year Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, which followed and extended the Suez Crisis in 1956. Though lasting only briefly, it was a crucial turning point in his life, as he was to recount on numerous later occasions; he found himself the \\"lord and master\\" over hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. While his daily decisions as governor profoundly affected their daily life, sometimes with life-and-death significance, he commanded without any personal knowledge of their language, and only the most vague idea of Palestinian culture and their way of life. This experience led to his decision to study Arabic, and the more general idea that Jews and Arabs who share a single small country should know each other's language. This conclusion, however, was not yet based on any particular political concept, and it was only many years later when he formulated his alternative political ideas that characterized his later career. The \\"Generals' Protest\\" and the Six-Day War During the severe political crisis of May 1967, in the lead-up to the Six-Day War, Peled‚Äîthen at the rank of Aluf (Major General) and in charge of the IDF Supply Division‚Äîwas considered a hawk. At the time when the government of PM Levi Eshkol seemed to be hesitating whether or not to launch a pre-emptive attack on the Egyptian armies concentrating in the Sinai, Peled was among a group of generals who demanded that the government start a war, and threatened to resign if it did not. Others involved in this Generals' Protest (which only became known to the general public many years later) were then Major General Ariel Sharon and Major General Israel Tal. Sharon later became Defence Minister and Prime Minister and held positions then diametrically opposite Peled's. Tal, who later also became a dove, but a less radical one, never entered active politics. Some historians credit the Generals' Protest with a decisive role in Israel's making the decision to launch the Six-Day War‚Äîa crucial turning point in the history of the country and of the entire Middle East to the present day. Others, however, assert that the Eshkol Government had already decided to go to war and that its apparent hesitation was mainly aimed at gaining international (and specifically, American) support. When later asked about this incident‚Äîas he was on numerous occasions during his later career on the Left‚ÄîPeled expressed no regret. He stated that having been in charge of the Supply Division, he was aware that prolonged mobilization, with the IDF reserves comprising a significant percentage of Israel's overall workforce, would severely cripple the country's economy, which was already suffering from a severe, years-long recession. Therefore, Peled asserted, he was duty-bound to tell the government that the country could not afford a long mobilization and that it had to strike \\"a sharp decisive blow,\\" after which the reserves could be discharged‚Äîwhich is what Israel proceeded to do in the June 1967 Six-Day War. Peled reiterated, however, that he had conceived of this as a purely military operation to counter a military threat, and that he had no idea that Israel would maintain occupation of the territories captured for decades afterwards, or establish settlements designed to effect their annexation and permanently change their demographic character. He had opposed these tendencies as soon as they appeared after the war. Peled retired from military life in 1969. In that period he visited Vietnam as an official guest of the U.S. Army and was cordially received by American generals. At the time he still supported the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, a position that was to change in subsequent years. Scholar and commentator Peled had already studied Arabic literature during his military service, and soon after being discharged he completed and submitted to UCLA his Ph.D. thesis on the Egyptian Nobel Prize laureate Naguib Mahfouz. Subsequently, Peled was one of the founders of the Arabic Literature Department at Tel Aviv University, which he headed for several years, and soon gained a reputation as a serious and innovative scholar in his chosen field. At the same time, he started regularly publishing articles in the weekend edition of Maariv, in which the clear leftward change in his political stance was evident. He also joined the Israeli Labor Party, though holding no office on its behalf, and in the 1973 elections was among a group of prominent doves who called upon voters to vote for Labor, despite its faults, rather than for the more radical small left-wing parties (which, under Israel's system of proportional representation had a good chance of gaining some seats in the Knesset). Peled later reversed this position, becoming a leading member in several such left-wing parties in succession, and on numerous occasions expressing sharp criticism of Labor. Still, until his last day, he considered himself a Zionist, irrespective of the biting skepticism voiced by his political opponents on that point. Peace activist In 1975 Peled was one of the founders of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace (ICIPP), together with Uri Avnery, Yaakov Arnon, Yossi Amitai, Amos Keinan, Aryeh Eliav and others. Aside from Avnery (a journalist and Knesset member who had confronted the Israeli establishment since the early 1950s) most founders of the ICIPP‚Äîlike Peled himself‚Äîwere dissident members of the establishment who had moved leftward in the early 1970s.American Friends Service Committee: Profile of Matti Peled (March 30, 2010) Arnon, for example, was a noted economist, who had headed the Zionist Federation of the Netherlands until 1948, when he came to Israel and became the director-general of its newly founded Ministry of Finance; later on he was chairman of the board of the Israeli Electricity Company. Eliav had been until shortly before the secretary-general of the Alignment, from which he resigned over the declaration of then-PM Golda Meir that \\"There is no Palestinian people\\". The ICIPP Charter called for Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967 and the creation of an independent Palestinian state in these territories, Jerusalem being shared between them. At the time this was considered a very radical plan, which the ICIPP was the first Zionist organization to support it. (Peled and several other ICIPP members won a libel suit against a columnist who had called them and their organization \\"anti- Zionist.\\") The ICIPP sought to promote private and unofficial dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in as many ways as possible, but also to try to bring about official negotiations between the Government of Israel and the leadership of the PLO. As the chief coordinator of the ICIPP, Peled took a leading role in the initially clandestine meetings with PLO leaders. The first meeting in Paris in 1976 brought Peled and several other Israelis together with PLO senior official Issam Sartawi, who acted with the full authorisation of Yasser Arafat‚Äîthough Arafat personally would become involved in such dialogue only during the siege of Beirut in the First Lebanon War in 1982. The very holding of this dialogue represented a significant step from the PLO's side; until then, the organization had the official policy of \\"talking only to anti-Zionist Israelis;\\" i.e., only to a small handful among the Israeli Jewish population.Haaretz: Following in the footsteps of his father, a Zionist hero, toward a free and democratic Palestine (April 8, 2013) Sartawi was assassinated in 1983 by an extremist Palestinian group, as was Sa'id Hamami, another Palestinian participant in the dialogue. Also assassinated was Henri Curiel, an Egyptian Jewish communist living in exile in Paris, who had played a key role in facilitating the opening of Israeli-Palestinian contacts. Curiel's assassination in 1978 remains a mystery, with the French police never finding (and according to some of his friends, never making a real effort to find) the killer(s). The Israeli participants were spared such tragedies, though there were many death threats, and some newspaper columnists explicitly accused them of \\"treason.\\" The PLO was then considered to be arch-terrorists and murderers, and few Israelis could comprehend the idea of talking to them. Peled did approach his old comrade in arms Yitzhak Rabin, then on his first term as Prime Minister of Israel (1974‚Äì77). He offered to brief Rabin on his talks with the Palestinians, and Rabin consented. On several occasions, indeed, Sartawi and other Palestinian interlocutors used this channel to pass on specific messages intended for Rabin's ears. The PM patiently heard him out, but never consented to send a message in return. \\"That would be negotiating with the PLO, and I will never never do that\\" he told Peled‚Äîironic words in retrospect, as Rabin was later to conduct intensive talks with the PLO and sign the Oslo Agreement with Arafat. Peled always believed that Oslo was at least in part a late flowering of the seeds he and his friends had sown in the 1970s. Founding the Left Camp of Israel Peled's first direct involvement in a political party was in 1977 with the foundation of the short- lived Left Camp of Israel party, whose platform focused on advocating peace negotiations with the Palestinians. Peled, like virtually the entire membership of the ICIPP went into the new party as a matter of course, but things did not go as smoothly as may have been expected. While all members of the party were doves as far as the Israeli general political spectrum was concerned, there were considerable difference of political strategy and tactics. One faction, headed by Ran Cohen‚Äîlater a Knesset Member and cabinet minister for the Meretz party‚Äîheld that Israeli peaceniks talking to the Palestinians should strive to extract concessions from them, such as an official recognition of Israel. On the other hand, Peled‚Äîmember of the Left Camp of Israel Executive for the whole of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf‚Äîclaimed that the Palestinian leadership, representing its entire people, could not be expected to make in a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if and when it came to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP‚Äîwith Peled and Avnery at its head‚Äîbecame a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction. Things came to a head with the outbreak of the First Lebanon War in 1982. Peled outspokenly supported the reserve soldiers who refused to take part in the war, organised by the newly founded Yesh Gvul movement‚Äîsome 200 of whom served terms in the military prisons. Peled's position in support of the refusers drew much public attention due to Peled's illustrious military past. Ran Cohen, himself a reserve Colonel (Aluf- Misheh) strongly objected, stating that it was a soldier's duty to obey orders, even when he politically objects to the war being conducted; and indeed, Cohen himself, as an artillery officer, took part in the bombardment of Beirut. Avnery, Peled's partner, arrived in Beirut in quite different circumstances‚Äîcrossing the lines to conduct a first-ever meeting with PLO leader Yasser Arafat, at his besieged and bombarded headquarters. Cohen strongly condemned the meeting, which he characterised as \\"fawning\\". Thereupon Peled, always known as a forthright speaker, accused Cohen of being \\"a war criminal who bombards a civilian population\\". This precipitated a final split and break-up of the party. Cohen and his followers decisively parted ways with Peled and Avnery, and joined with Shulamit Aloni and other factions to form the Meretz party. Knesset Member in the Progressive List for Peace For their part, Peled and Avnery were in 1984 among the founding members of a Jewish-Arab political party, the Progressive List for Peace. Their Arab partners were headed by Mohammed Miari, a veteran radical political activist and human rights lawyer specializing in land confiscation cases, and Rev. Riach Abu-el-Assal, Vicar of the Anglican Church in Nazareth (later Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem). Several attempts were made by the government and right- wing parties to outlaw the PLP and prevent it from running in elections‚Äîwhich was the fate of earlier parties in which Miari was involved, such as Al Ard in 1965. However, the Supreme Court overturned these attempts. Thus, in the elections of that year Miari and Peled were elected to the Knesset. Peled's parliamentary term coincided with the tense atmosphere of the outbreak of the First Intifada. However, he was far from confining himself to the hotly controversial issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, taking great interest in a great spectrum of subjects, on some of which he found common ground with staunch right-wingers. He soon gained a reputation as one of the most serious and industrious of Israel's parliamentarians, whose speeches on the Knesset floor \\"resembled academic lectures\\". Reportedly, he was capable of reading up for a whole week to prepare a ten-minute speech on an obscure subject. To the despair of the party's press spokespersons, he utterly refused to make any \\"gimmicks\\" to catch the attention of the press, or include any \\"soundbite\\" in his parliamentary speeches. He lost his seat in the 1988 elections when the party was reduced to one seat. Final years Peled dedicated his last years to advancing a dialogue of mutual recognition and respect between Israelis and Palestinians, and to research of Arabic literature. He was the first Israeli professor of Arabic literature who introduced studies of Palestinian literature into the academic curriculum. Peled published numerous political articles in Israeli and international media and translated several pieces of Arabic literature to Hebrew. For what turned out to be his last work of translation‚Äî\\"The Sages of Darkness\\" by the Syrian- Kurdish writer Salim Barakat‚ÄîPeled won the Translators' Association Prize. In 1993, he took part in forming Gush Shalom, the Israeli Peace Bloc‚Äîa grassroots peace movement in whose ranks Peled alternately expressed a sharp criticism of his old friend Rabin for severe human rights violations in the occupied territories; warmly commended and congratulated him for his dramatic rapprochement with the PLO and the handshake with Arafat on the White House lawn; and finally expressed a growing worry and anxiety at the slow pace of the peace process and the continuing occupation, oppression and settlement activity‚Äîwhich gave ample opportunity, as Peled wrote in several admonitory articles, to extremists on both sides to create a renewed dynamic of escalation. In 1994, seventy years of robust health were broken when Peled felt sharp pains that turned out to be the sign of an incurable liver cancer. Virtually until his last day he followed political developments and continued to write political essays even when the very act of sitting at his word processor became extremely difficult and painful. His last essay, written a few weeks before his death and published in The Other Israel, the ICIPP's newsletter, was entitled \\"Requiem to Oslo\\"‚Äîan article expressing disappointment with the Oslo Accords and predicting the explosion that was to break out with the Second Intifada of 2000. Peled's funeral brought together a unique combination of radical peace activists with former generals and senior officers. At the graveside, messages of condolences were read from both the government of Israel and PLO Chairman Arafat. After his death, his widow Zika Peled contributed Matti's private library to the Arab Teachers' College at Beit Berl. His political articles were contributed to the Lavon Institute. Peled was married and had two sons and two daughters. One daughter, Nurit Peled-Elhanan, is a professor of language and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She lost her 14-year-old daughter Smadar Elhanan in the 1997 Ben Yehuda Street suicide bombing, in the center of Jerusalem. One son, Miko Peled, is also a peace activist and lives in San Diego.

Descent of the manor=de Meulles= In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was a double manor, part of the historic Shirwell Hundred and was one of the 176 landholdings in Devon held in-chief by Baldwin de Meulles, Sheriff of Devon, who held the largest fiefdom in Devon and was the first feudal baron of Okehampton. These two holdings are thought to correspond to today's division of the parish into (Higher) Loxhore, where is situated the parish church, and Lower Loxhore, two miles south in the valley bottom of a small tributary stream of the River Yeo. Prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066 the part called Lochesore was held by the Saxon Doleswif, whilst the other, called Locheshore, the entry following it, was held by Wulfward. Before 1066 both paid tax at the same sum, for 1/2 a hide, and both were valued in 1086 at 20 shillings. Wulfward's former holding contained more arable land, and 4 more villagers, but less pasture and woodland than Doleswif's. Wulfward's holding also contained 4 acres of alder-grove, the presence of which wetland-loving trees may suggest his estate was Lower Loxhore, and that Doleswif held the estate on higher ground where now stands the parish church. Baldwin de Meulles' tenant of both holdings as listed in Domesday Book was \\"Robert de Beaumont\\". =Beaumont= In the Domesday Book of 1086 the twin holdings of Loxhore were two of at least four manors held in Devon by the Norman magnate Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Count of Meulan (c. 1040/50-1118) as a mesne lord from Baldwin de Meulles.Thorn, Caroline & Frank, Domesday Book, Vol. 9, Devon, Morris, John, (general editor), Chichester, 1985, Part 2, (notes) 16,65 William the Conqueror had granted Robert about 91 English manors in several counties as recompense for his service in the Norman conquest of England. Loxhore, along with Ashford (east of Heanton Punchardon) and Shirwell, stayed for many generations within the Beaumont family.Beaumont, Edward T., The Beaumonts in History. A.D. 850-1850.

The only previous holder of that Earldom was Hugh de Beaumont, 3rd son of Robert de Beaumont who held Shirwell & Loxhore The earliest positively identifiable descendant of the Domesday tenant Robert de Beaumont was the 13th-century Sir Richard Beaumont, whose family had long been seated at the capital estate of Youlston within their adjacent manor of Shirwell. His eldest son and heir was Philip Beaumont (died c. 1272), of Youlston, and his younger son was William Beaumont \\"of Sabrecot\\" (i.e.\\"Sepscott\\"), to whom he granted the manor of Loxhore. Sepscott survives today as an estate about 3 miles south of Youlston, and 7 miles south-west of Loxhore Church, and was anciently known as Sabrecot, Shebescote et al.,In Feudal Aids, I, p.361, the fee of Shebescote in the manor of Shirwell, was held from the feudal baron of Okehampton by Robert Beaupel (Thorne, Domesday Book, Devon, part 2, (notes) 16,65) (probably of the Landkey family) and this branch of the family eventually inherited Shirwell also, on the failure of the senior male line. Philip Beaumont (died c. 1272), of Youlston married Ermengard Punchardon (originally de Pont-Chardon), daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Punchardon of Heanton Punchardon in Devon. His son was Sir John Beaumont (died 1330), of Youlston, MP for Devon in 1326, who married Alice Scudamore.Beaumont, T., p.61 His son was John Beaumont who married Alice, of unknown family. His only son and heir was William Beaumont, who died without progeny leaving his sister Joan Beaumont, the wife of Sir James Chudleigh, as his heiress. She too died without progeny and the Beaumont estates, now enlarged by the addition of the Punchardon lands, passed to her cousin John Beaumont (died 1378/80), of Sepscott, grandson of William Beaumont, who had been granted Loxhore by his father Sir Richard Beaumont, and son of Richard Beaumont. John Beaumont married Joane Crawthorne (or Crawstone), the heiress of her grandfather Sir Robert Stockey, MP in 1318. He purchased the North Devon manor of Parkham.Beaumont, T., p.62 Their son was William Beaumont, Sheriff of Devon in 1399,Pole, Sir William, Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon who held the Castle and Borough of Barnstaple. He further increased the family's estates by marrying Isabel Willington, daughter of Sir John Willington of Umberleigh, and co-heiress of her brother John Willington (died 1396). Their son was Sir Thomas Beaumont (1401-1450), born at the Willington manor of Yate in Gloucestershire. He married twice, the offspring of which two marriages became successively heirs to his estates.

The seventh letter, here substituted as ·õü (o), was destroyed when the ring was cut in half by thieves in 1875. The reading of the damaged part is disputed, but it is clear that the inscription begins with the name of the Goths (Gutani) and ends with the word for \\"holy, sacred\\" (hailag). Gothic religion was the original religion of the Goths before their conversion to Christianity. History The Goths first appear in historical record in the early 3rd century, and they were Christianized in the 4th and 5th centuries. Information on the form of the Germanic paganism practiced by the Goths before Christianization is thus limited to a comparatively narrow and sparsely documented time-window in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The center of the Gothic cult was the village or clan (kuni), and the ritual sacrificial meal held by the villagers under the leadership of the reiks. The reiks saw themselves as the guardians of ethnic tradition. This was expressed starkly in the Gothic persecution of Christians in the 370s, when the reiks Athanaric saw this privilege threatened by the new religion, responding by the persecution of converted Goths (but not of Christian foreigners): according to the Passio of Sabas the Goth, Sabas was executed for professing Christianity (or rather for refusing to sacrifice to the tribal gods), while his companion, the priest Sansalas, was let go because he was a foreigner. After the Goths had settled in Scythia in the 2nd century, it is probable that a process of ethnogenesis was set in motion, and that most of the \\"Goths\\" of the 3rd and 4th century were not in fact descended from Scandinavia but (much as was the case with the \\"Huns\\" in the following century) consisted of a heterogeneous population which was united under the name of \\"Goths\\" by virtue of having submitted to the elite formed by the ruling dynasties of the reiks. Gothic religion was purely tribal, in which polytheism, nature worship, and ancestor worship were one and the same. We know that the Amali dynasty deified their ancestors, the Ansis (Aesir), and that the Tervingi opened battle with songs of praise for their ancestors. The gradual Christianisation of parts of the Gothic population came to a turning- point in the 370s. A civil strife between the Christian reiks Fritigern and the pagan reiks Athanaric prompted Roman military intervention on the side of the Christian party, leading to the Gothic War (376‚Äì382). In 376, the Romans allowed a number of ostensibly Christian Goths, including bishops and priests, to cross the Danube, but these \\"looked like clowns to the pagan Romans, and utterly scandalized the Roman Christians\\", supposing that they were in fact pagan Goths who had dressed up as Christian clerics in order to be granted asylum by the Romans. Religious practices The word god itself is cognate with the Gothic word guth for a pagan idol (presumably a wooden statue of the kind paraded by Winguric on a chariot when he challenged the Gothic Christians to worship the tribal gods, executing them after they refused). It became the word for the Christian God in the Gothic Bible, changing its grammatical gender from neuter to masculine in this new sense only. The name of the Goths themselves is presumably related, meaning \\"those who libate\\" (while guth \\"idol\\" is the object of the act of libation). The words for \\"to sacrifice\\" and for \\"sacrificer\\" were blotan and blostreis, used in Biblical Gothic in the sense of \\"Christian worship\\" and \\"Christian priest\\". One peculiarity which separates Gothic religion from all other forms of early Germanic religion is the absence of weapons as grave goods. While pagan warrior graves in Scandinavia, England and Germany almost invariably contain weapons, and the practice is discontinued with Christianization, the pagan Goths do not seem to have felt the need to bury their dead with weapons. This may have arisen from the fact that weapon burials began to become prominent among pagan peoples in the 5th and 6th centuries, possibly as a method of permanently establishing prestige upon certain families through burial ritual in a period of a heightened economy and increased inter-group competition, thus well after the Christianization of the Goths. A Gothic belief in witches is attested with the story of the haliurun(n)ae (c.f. Anglo-Saxon hellr√∫ne) who were expelled from the tribe by king Filimer, after which they mated with evil spirits and gave birth to the Huns, who eventually destroyed the Gothic empire. Wolfram compares the rejection of necromancy or witchcraft by the Goths with the pagan Scandinavian rejection of the sei√∞r of Finnic sorcerers or shamans. Gothic deities Regarding the individual gods worshipped among the Goths, very little can be said with certainty. They did have a cult of a god of war, identified with Roman Mars, presumably a manifestation of Germanic Tiwaz, perhaps (on the basis on the letter names) called *Teiws in Gothic, among the Tervingi perhaps also known as \\"The Terwing\\", as the supposed eponymous ancestor of the tribe. Perhaps related too to the lost sword legend of Tyrfingr, 'the finger' of the god Tyr causing sudden death on touch to its enemies. Another important god may have been called *Fairguneis, identified with Roman Jupiter. Then, there was Gaut or Gapt, the ancestor of the Amali dynasty, and presumably eponymous of the entire people of the \\"Goths\\"; it is unclear whether this deity should be considered independent of those just mentioned, or if it is just another name by which either of them was also known; in any case, Old Norse Gaut in later centuries was considered another manifestation of Odin in Scandinavia. It may also be significant, that in the Eddaic tradition, Odin himself is said to have come to the north from the \\"Black sea region/Turkland\\", i.e. the lands some believe was formerly and later inhabited by some ancestors of the Goths. If Gapt was the original \\"ansic\\" ancestor, later identified with Wodan-Odin, the Gothic letter name *ansuz (aza) may testify to his importance. The Aesyr were considered the folk which the god Odin led in his 'Wuoth' ('raging') Ghostly Host charging through the nights and battlefields. These are identified as 'The Aes' (or Asians) of Antiquity, where the Indo-Iranian Alans were considered as the first gens that came off Asia beyond the Western Scythians or Sarmatians in the steppes ethnic geography for the Greek and classical sources. But these may be echoes that hark back to an older influence from many centuries earlier, when it is visible in the archaeological records the introduction of steppes elements among the earliest Germanic cultural horizon, or in the formation of the proto-Germanic ethnogenesis at the end of the Bronze Age. Finally, the letter name enguz may testify to the existence of the god Ingwaz among the Goths, but there is no additional evidence for this. The river Danube may have also been deified, as *Donaws. In the light of comparative evidence from later forms of Germanic paganism, it seems possible that the \\"Germanic trinity\\" of Wodan- Tiwaz-Thonar may have had a parallel among the Goths, with Gapt, Teiws and Fairguneis; but this does not imply that Gapt should be assumed to have had the attributes typical of Viking Age Odin.

The term was coined after Ilya Ehrenburg's 1954 novel The Thaw (\\"–û—Ç—Ç–µ–ø–µ–ª—å\\"), sensational for its time. The Thaw became possible after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953.

The Thaw was highlighted by Khrushchev's 1954 visit to Beijing, People's Republic of China, his 1955 visit to Belgrade, Yugoslavia (with whom relations had soured since the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split in 1948), and his subsequent meeting with Dwight Eisenhower later that year, culminating in Khrushchev's 1959 visit to the United States. The Thaw initiated irreversible transformation of the entire Soviet society by opening up for some economic reforms and international trade, educational and cultural contacts, festivals, books by foreign authors, foreign movies, art shows, popular music, dances and new fashions, and massive involvement in international sport competitions. As the power struggle between pro-Khrushchevists and pro-Stalinists never stopped, it eventually weakened the Soviet Communist Party. The Thaw allowed some freedom of information in the media, arts, and culture; international festivals; foreign films; uncensored books; and new forms of entertainment on the emerging national TV, ranging from massive parades and celebrations to popular music and variety shows, satire and comedies, and all-star shows like Goluboy Ogonyok. Such political and cultural updates altogether had a significant influence on the public consciousness of several generations of people in the Soviet Union.Khrushchev, Sergei N., Nikita Khrushchev and the Creation of a Superpower, Penn State Press, 2000.Schecter, Jerrold L, ed. and trans., Khrushchev Remembers: The Glasnost Tapes, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1990 Leonid Brezhnev, who succeeded Khrushchev, put an end to the Thaw. The 1965 economic reform of Alexei Kosygin was de-facto discontinued by the end of 1960s, while the trial of the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966‚Äîthe first such public trial since Stalin's reign‚Äîand the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 identified reversal of the liberalization of the country. Khrushchev and Stalin Khrushchev and Stalin, 1936, Kremlin Khrushchev's Thaw had its genesis in the concealed power struggle among Stalin's lieutenants. Several major leaders among the Red Army commanders, such as Marshal Georgy Zhukov and his loyal officers, had some serious tensions with Stalin's secret service.Dmitri Volkogonov. Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy, 1996, On the surface, the Red Army and the Soviet leadership seemed united after their victory in World War II. However, the hidden ambitions of the top people around Stalin, as well as Stalin's own suspicions, had prompted Khrushchev that he could rely only on those few; they would stay with him through the entire political power struggle.The most secretive people (in Russian): –ó–µ–Ω—å–∫–æ–≤–∏—á –ù. –°–∞–º—ã–µ –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏. –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è –±–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–π. –ú., –∏–∑–¥. –û–õ–ú–ê-–ü–†–ï–°–° –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω—ã–π –º–∏—Ä, 2003 –≥. That power struggle was surreptitiously prepared by Khrushchev while Stalin was alive, and came to surface after Stalin's death in March 1953. By that time, Khrushchev's people were planted everywhere in the Soviet hierarchy, which allowed Khrushchev to execute, or remove his main opponents, and then introduce some changes in the rigid Soviet ideology and hierarchy. Stalin's leadership had reached new extremes in ruling people at all levels, such as the deportations of nationalities, the Leningrad Affair, the Doctors' plot, and official criticisms of writers and other intellectuals. At the same time, millions of soldiers and officers had seen Europe after World War II, and had become aware of different ways of life which existed outside the Soviet Union. Upon Stalin's orders many were arrested and punished again, including the attacks on the popular Marshal Georgy Zhukov and other top generals, who had exceeded the limits on taking trophies when they looted the defeated nation of Germany. The loot was confiscated by Stalin's security apparatus, and Marshal Zhukov was demoted, humiliated and exiled; he became a staunch anti-Stalinist.Georgy Zhukov's Memoirs: Marshal G.K. Zhukov, Memoirs, Moscow, Olma-Press, 2002 Zhukov waited until the death of Stalin, which allowed Khrushchev to bring Zhukov back for a new political battle.Strobe Talbott, ed., Khrushchev Remembers (2 vol., tr. 1970‚Äì74) The temporary union between Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov was founded on their similar backgrounds, interests and weaknesses: both were peasants, both were ambitious, both were abused by Stalin, both feared the Stalinists, and both wanted to change these things. Khrushchev and Zhukov needed one another to eliminate their mutual enemies in the Soviet political elite.Vladimir Karpov. (Russian source: –ú–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –ñ—É–∫–æ–≤: –û–ø–∞–ª–∞, 1994) Moscow, Veche publication. In 1953, Zhukov helped Khrushchev to eliminate Lavrenty Beria, then a First Vice-Premier, who was promptly executed in Moscow, as well as several other figures of Stalin's circle. Soon Khrushchev ordered the release of millions of political prisoners from the Gulag camps. Under Khrushchev's rule the number of prisoners in the Soviet Union was decreased, according to some writers, from 13 million to 5 million people. Khrushchev also promoted and groomed Leonid Brezhnev, whom he brought to the Kremlin and introduced to Stalin in 1952. Then Khrushchev promoted Brezhnev to Presidium (Politburo) and made him the Head of Political Directorate of the Red Army and Navy, and moved him up to several other powerful positions. Brezhnev in return helped Khrushchev by tipping the balance of power during several critical confrontations with the conservative hard-liners, including the ouster of pro-Stalinists headed by Molotov and Malenkov.World Affairs. Leonid Brezhnev. Khrushchev's 1956 speech denouncing Stalin O kulcie jednostki i jego nastƒôpstwach, Warsaw, March 1956, first edition of the Secret Speech, published for the inner use in the PUWP. Khrushchev denounced Stalin in his speech On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences, delivered at the closed session of the 20th Party Congress, behind closed doors, after midnight on 25 February 1956.Russian source: Factbook on the history of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union. –°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫ –ø–æ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –∏ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞ 1898 - 1991 . In this speech, Khrushchev described the damage done by Joseph Stalin's cult of personality, and the repressions, known as the Great Purge that killed millions and traumatized many people in the Soviet Union. After the delivery of the speech, it was officially disseminated in a shorter form among members of the Soviet Communist Party across the USSR starting 5 March 1956. Then Khrushchev initiated a wave of rehabilitations that officially restored the reputations of many millions of innocent victims, who were killed or imprisoned in the Great Purge under Stalin. Further, tentative moves were made through official and unofficial channels to relax restrictions on freedom of speech that had been held over from the rule of Stalin. Khrushchev's 1956 speech was the strongest effort ever in the USSR to bring political change, at that time, after several decades of fear of Stalin's rule, that took countless innocent lives.Stalin's Terror: High Politics and Mass Repression in the Soviet Union by Barry McLoughlin and Kevin McDermott (eds). Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p. 6 Khrushchev's speech was published internationally within a few months, and his initiatives to open and liberalize the USSR had surprised the world. Khrushchev's speech had angered many of his powerful enemies, thus igniting another round of ruthless power struggle within the Soviet Communist Party. Issues and tensions=Georgian revolt= Khrushchev's denouncement of Stalin came as a shock to the Soviet people. Many in Georgia, Stalin's homeland, especially the young generation, bred on the panegyrics and permanent praise of the \\"genius\\" of Stalin, perceived it as a national insult. In March 1956, a series of spontaneous rallies to mark the third anniversary of Stalin's death quickly evolved into an uncontrollable mass demonstration and political demands such as the change of the central government in Moscow and calls for the independence of Georgia from the Soviet Union appeared,Nahaylo, Bohdan; Swoboda, Victor (1990), Soviet disunion: a history of the nationalities problem in the USSR, p. 120. Free Press, leading to the Soviet army intervention and bloodshed in the streets of Tbilisi.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, pp. 303-305. Indiana University Press, =Polish and Hungarian Revolutions of 1956= The first big international failure of Khrushchev's politics came in October‚ÄìNovember 1956. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was suppressed by a massive invasion of Soviet tanks and Red Army troops in Budapest. The street fighting against the invading Red Army caused thousands of casualties among Hungarian civilians and militia, as well as hundreds of the Soviet military personnel killed. The attack by the Soviet Red Army also caused massive emigration from Hungary, as hundreds of thousands of Hungarians had fled as refugees.Gati, Charles (2006). Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt. Stanford University Press. . At the same time, the Polish October emerged as the political and social climax in Poland. Such democratic changes in the internal life of Poland were also perceived with fear and anger in Moscow, where the rulers did not want to lose control, fearing the political threat to Soviet security and power in Eastern Europe.Stalinism in Poland, 1944-1956, ed. and tr. by A. Kemp-Welch, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1999, . =1957 plot against Khrushchev= A faction of the Soviet communist party was enraged by Khrushchev's speech in 1956, and rejected Khrushchev's de-Stalinization and liberalization of Soviet society. One year after Khrushchev's secret speech, the Stalinists attempted to oust Khrushchev from the leadership position in the Soviet Communist Party. Khrushchev's enemies considered him hypocritical as well as ideologically wrong, given Khrushchev's involvement in Stalin's Great Purges, and other similar events as one of Stalin's favorites. They believed that Khrushchev's policy of peaceful coexistence would leave the Soviet Union open to attack. Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Georgy Malenkov and joined by Dmitri Shepilov at the last minute after Kaganovich convinced him the group had a majority, attempted to depose Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Party in May 1957. But Khrushchev had used Marshal Georgy Zhukov again. Khrushchev was saved by several strong appearances in his supportespecially powerful was support from both Zhukov and Mikoyan.Volkogonov, Dmitri Antonovich (Author); Shukman, Harold (Editor, Translator). Autopsy for an Empire: the Seven Leaders Who Built the Soviet Regime. Free Press, 1998 (Hardcover, ); (Paperback, ) At the extraordinary session of the Central Committee held in late June 1957, Khrushchev labeled his opponents the Anti-Party Group and won a vote which reaffirmed his position as First Secretary. Then he expelled Molotov, Kaganovich and Malenkov from the Secretariat and ultimately from the Communist Party itself. =Economy and political tensions= Khrushchev's attempts in reforming the Soviet industrial infrastructure led to his clashes with professionals in most branches of the Soviet economy. His reform of administrative organization caused him more problems. In a politically motivated move to weaken the central state bureaucracy in 1957, Khrushchev replaced the industrial ministries in Moscow with regional Councils of People's Economy, sovnarkhozes, causing himself many new enemies among the ranks in Soviet government. Eventually Khrushchev's power, although indisputable, was slowly eroding and never became comparable to that of Stalin's. Some of the new people who came into the Soviet hierarchy, like Mikhail Gorbachev were younger, better educated and more independent thinkers.Mikhail Gorbachev. The first steps towards a new era. Guardian. In 1956, Khrushchev introduced the concept of a minimum wage. The idea was met with much criticism with communist hardliners, they claimed that the minimum wage was so small, that most people were still underpaid in reality. The next step was a contemplated financial reform. However, Khrushchev stopped short of real monetary reform, when he ordered the replacement of old money bearing portraits of Stalin, and made a simple redenomination of the ruble 10:1 in 1961. In 1961, Khrushchev finalized his battle against Stalin: the body of the dictator was removed from Lenin's Mausoleum on the Red Square and then buried outside the walls of the Kremlin.Pipes, Richard. Communism: A History. Modern Library Chronicles, 2001 (hardcover, ); (2003 paperback reprint, ) The removal of Stalin's body out of Lenin's Mausoleum was arguably among the most provocative moves made by Khrushchev during the Thaw. The removal of Stalin's body consolidated pro- Stalinists against Khrushchev, and alienated even his loyal apprentices, such as Leonid Brezhnev. Openness and cultural liberalization Enver Mamedov (right), the editor of The USSR magazine, presents it to the CBS audience (1957) After the early 1950s, Soviet society enjoyed a series of cultural and sports events and entertainment of unprecedented scale, such as the first Spartakiad, as well as several innovative film comedies, such as the Carnival Night, and several popular music festivals. Some classical musicians, filmmakers and ballet stars were allowed to make appearances outside the Soviet Union in order to better represent its culture and society to the world. In 1956, an agreement was achieved between the Soviet and US Governments to resume the publication and distribution in the Soviet Union of the US-produced magazine Amerika (magazine), and to launch its counterpart, the USSR magazine in the USA.Walter L. Hixson: Parting the Curtain: Propaganda, Culture, and the Cold War, 1945-1961 (MacMillan 1997), p.117 In the summer of 1956, just a few months after Khrushchev's secret speech, Moscow became the center of the first Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR. The event was made pompous in the Soviet style: Moscow hosted large sports teams and groups of fans in national costumes who came from all Union republics. Khrushchev used the event to accentuate his new political and social goals, and to show himself as a new leader who was completely different from Stalin. In July 1957, the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students was held in Moscow. It was the first World Festival of Youth and Students held in the Soviet Union, which was opening its doors for the first time to the world. The festival attracted 34,000 people from 130 countries.Moscow marks 50 years since youth festival. In 1958, the first International Tchaikovsky Competition was held in Moscow. The winner was American pianist Van Cliburn, who gave sensational performances of Russian music. Khrushchev personally approved giving the top award to the American musician. Khrushchev's Thaw opened the Soviet society to a degree that allowed some foreign movies, books, art and music. Some previously banned writers and composers, such as Anna Akhmatova and Mikhail Zoshchenko, among others, were brought back to public life, as the official Soviet censorship policies had changed. Books by some internationally recognized authors, such as Ernest Hemingway, were published in millions of copies to satisfy the interest of readers in the USSR. In 1962, Khrushchev personally approved the publication of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's story One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, which became a sensation, and made history as the first uncensored publication about Gulag labor camps. There was still a lot of agitation against religion that had temporarily halted during the war effort and the years after toward the end of Stalin's rule. The era of the Cultural Thaw ended in December 1962 after the Manege Affair. = Music = Censorship of the arts relaxed throughout the Soviet Union. During this time of liberalization, Russian composers, performers, and listeners of music experienced a newfound openness in musical expression which led to the foundation of an unofficial music scene from the mid 1950s to the 1970s. Despite these liberalizing reforms in music, many argue that Khrushchev's legislation of the arts was based, less on freedom of expression of the Soviet people, and too much on his own personal tastes. Following the emergence of some unconventional, avant-garde music as a result of his reforms, on 8 March 1963, Khrushchev delivered a speech which began to reverse some of his de- Stalinization reforms. In his speech, he stated: \\"We flatly reject this cacophonous music. Our people can't use this garbage as a tool for their ideology.\\" He claimed: \\"Society has a right to condemn works which are contrary to the interests of the people.\\" Although the Thaw was considered a time of openness and liberalization, Khrushchev continued to place restrictions on these newfound freedoms. Nonetheless, despite Khrushchev's inconsistent liberalization of musical expression, his speeches were not so much \\"restrictions\\" as \\"exhortations\\". Artists, and especially musicians, were provided access to resources that had previously been censored or altogether inaccessible prior to Khrushchev's reforms. The composers of this time, for example, were able to access scores by composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and Pierre Boulez, gaining inspiration from and imitating previously concealed musical scores. As Soviet composers gained access to new scores and were given a taste of freedom of expression during the late 1950s, two separate groups began to emerge. One group wrote predominantly \\"official\\" music which was \\"sanctioned, nourished, and supported by the Composers' Union\\". The second group wrote \\"unofficial\\", \\"left\\", \\"avant-garde\\", or \\"underground\\" music, marked by a general state of opposition against the Soviet Union. Although both groups are widely considered to be interdependent, many regard the unofficial music scene as more independent and politically influential than the former in the context of the Thaw. The unofficial music that emerged during the Thaw was marked by the attempt, whether successful or unsuccessful, to reinterpret and reinvigorate the \\"battle of form and content\\" of the classical music of the period. Although the term \\"unofficial\\" implies a level of illegality involved in the production of this music, composers, performers, and listeners of \\"unofficial\\" music actually used \\"official\\" means of production. Rather, the music was considered unofficial within a context that counteracted, contradicted, and redefined the socialist realist requirements from within their official means and spaces. Unofficial music emerged in two distinct phases. The first phase of unofficial music was marked by performances of \\"escapist\\" pieces. From a composer's perspective, these works were escapist in the sense that their sound and structure withdrew from the demands of socialist realism. Additionally, pieces developed during this phase of unofficial music allowed the listeners the ability to escape the familiar sounds that Soviet officials officially sanctioned. The second phase of unofficial music emerged during the late 1960s, when the plots of the music became more apparent, and composers wrote in a more mimetic style, writing in contrast to their earlier compositions of the first phase. Throughout the musical Thaw, the generation of \\"young composers\\" who had matured their musical tastes with broader access to music that had previously been censored was the prime focus of the unofficial music scene. The Thaw allowed these composers the freedom to access old and new scores, especially those originating in the Western avant-garde. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, young composers such as Andrei Volkonsky and Edison Denisov, among others, developed abstract musical practices that created sounds that were new to the common listener's ear. Socialist realist music was widely considered \\"boring\\", and the unofficial concerts that the young composers presented allowed the listeners \\"a means of circumventing, reinterpreting, and undercutting the dominant socialist realist aesthetic codes\\". Despite the seemingly rebellious nature of the unofficial music of the Thaw, historians debate whether the unofficial music that emerged during this time should truly be considered as resistance to the Soviet system. While a number of participants in unofficial concerts \\"claimed them to be a liberating activity, connoting resistance, opposition, or protest of some sort\\", some critics claim that rather than taking an active role in opposing Soviet power, composers of unofficial music simply \\"withdrew\\" from the demands of the socialist realist music and chose to ignore the norms of the system. Although Westerners tend to categorize unofficial composers as \\"dissidents\\" against the Soviet system, many of these composers were afraid to take action against the system in fear that it might have a negative impact on their professional advancement. Many composers favored a less direct, yet significant method of opposing the system through their lack of musical compliance. Regardless of the intentions of the composers, the effect of their music on audiences throughout the Soviet Union and abroad \\"helped audiences imagine alternative possibilities to those suggested by Soviet authorities, principally through the ubiquitous stylistic tropes of socialist realism\\". Although the music of the younger generation of unofficial Soviet composers experienced little widespread success in the West, its success within the Soviet Union was apparent throughout the Thaw (Schwarz 423). Even after Khrushchev's fall from power in October 1964, the freedoms that composers, performers, and listeners felt through unofficial concerts lasted into the 1970s. However, despite the powerful role that unofficial music played in the Soviet Union during the Thaw, much of the music that was composed during that time continued to be controlled. As a result of this, a great deal of this unofficial music remains undocumented. Consequently, much of what we know now about unofficial music in the Thaw can be sourced only through interviews with those composers, performers, and listeners who witnessed the unofficial music scene during the Thaw. International relations The death of Stalin in 1953 and the twentieth CPSU congress of February 1956 had a huge impact throughout Eastern Europe. Literary thaws actually preceded the congress in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and the GDR and later burgeoned briefly in Czechoslovakia and Chairman Mao's China. With the exception of the arch Stalinist and anti-Titoist Albania, Romania was the only country where intellectuals avoided an open clash with the regime, influenced partly by the lack of any earlier revolt in post-war Romania that would have forced the regime to make concessions.Johanna Granville, \\"Dej-a-Vu: Early Roots of Romania's Independence,\\" East European Quarterly, vol. XLII, no. 4 (Winter 2008), pp. 365-404. From left to right: Nina Kukharchuk, Mamie Eisenhower, Nikita Khrushchev and Dwight Eisenhower at a state dinner in 1959 Khrushchev meeting U.S. president John F. Kennedy in 1961 In the West, Khrushchev's Thaw is known as a temporary thaw in the icy tension between the United States and the USSR during the Cold War. The tensions were able to thaw because of Khrushchev's de-Stalinization of the USSR and peaceful coexistence theory and also because of US President Eisenhower's cautious attitude and peace attempts. For example, both leaders attempted to achieve peace by attending the 1955 Geneva International Peace Summit and developing the Open Skies Policy and Quest for Arms Agreement. The leaders' attitudes allowed them to, as Khrushchev put it, \\"break the ice.\\" Khrushchev's Thaw developed largely as a result of Khrushchev's theory of peaceful co-existence which believed the two superpowers (USA and USSR) and their ideologies could co-exist together, without war (peacefully). Khrushchev had created the theory of peaceful existence in an attempt to reduce hostility between the two superpowers. He tried to prove peaceful coexistence by attending international peace conferences, such as the Geneva Summit, and by traveling internationally, such as his trip to USA's Camp David in 1959. This spirit of co-operation was severely damaged by the 1960 U-2 incident. The Soviet presentation of downed pilot Francis Gary Powers at the May 1960 Paris Peace Summit and Eisenhower's refusal to apologize ended much of the progress of this era. Then Khrushchev approved the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Further deterioration of the Thaw and decay of Khrushchev's international political standing happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. At that time, the Soviet and international media were making two completely opposite pictures of reality, while the world was at the brink of a nuclear war. Although direct communication between Khrushchev and the US president John F. KennedyKennedy, Robert F. Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis; . helped to end the crisis, Khrushchev's political image in the West was damaged. Social, cultural and economic reforms Khrushchev's Thaw caused unprecedented social, cultural and economic transformations in the Soviet Union. The 60s generation actually started in the 1950s, with their uncensored poetry, songs and books publications. The 6th World Festival of Youth and Students had opened many eyes and ears in the Soviet Union. Many new social trends stemmed from that festival. Many Russian women became involved in love affairs with men visiting from all over the world, what resulted in the so-called \\"inter-baby boom\\" in Moscow and Leningrad. The festival also brought new styles and fashions that caused further spread of youth subculture called \\"stilyagi\\". The festival also \\"revolutionized\\" the underground currency trade and boosted the black market. Emergence of such popular stars as Bulat Okudzhava, Edita Piekha, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Bella Akhmadulina, and the superstar Vladimir Vysotsky had changed the popular culture forever in the USSR. Their poetry and songs broadened the public consciousness of the Soviet people and pushed guitars and tape recorders to masses, so the Soviet people became exposed to independent channels of information and public mentality was eventually updated in many ways. Khrushchev finally liberated millions of peasants; by his order the Soviet government gave them identifications, passports, and thus allowed them to move out of poor villages to big cities. Massive housing construction, known as khrushchevkas, were undertaken during the 1950s and 1960s. Millions of cheap and basic residential blocks of low-end flats were built all over the Soviet Union to accommodate the largest migration ever in the Soviet history, when masses of landless peasants moved to Soviet cities. The move caused a dramatic change of the demographic picture in the USSR, and eventually finalized the decay of peasantry in Russia. Economic reforms were contemplated by Alexei Kosygin, who was chairman of the USSR State Planning Committee in 1959 and then a full member of the Presidium (also known as Politburo after 1966) in 1960. =Consumerism= In 1959, the American National Exhibition came to Moscow with the goals of displaying United States' productivity and prosperity. The latent goal of the Americans was to get the Soviet Union to reduce production of heavy industry. If the Soviet Union started putting their resources towards producing consumer goods, it would also mean a reduction of war materials. An estimated number of over twenty million Soviet citizens viewed the twenty-three U.S. exhibitions during a thirty-year period.Richmond, Yale, \\"The 1959 Kitchen Debate (or, how cultural exchanges changed the Soviet Union),\\" Russian Life 52, no. 4 (2009), 47. These exhibitions were part of the Cultural Agreement formed by the United States and the Soviet Union in order to acknowledge the long-term exchange of: science, technology, agriculture, medicine, public health, radio, television, motion pictures, publications, government, youth, athletics, scholarly research, culture, and tourism.Richmond, Yale, \\"The 1959 Kitchen Debate (or, how cultural exchanges changed the Soviet Union),\\" Russian Life 52, no. 4 (2009), 45. In addition to the influences of European and Western culture, the spoils of the Cold War exposed the Soviet people to a new way of life.Brusilovskaia, Lidiia, \\"The Culture of Everyday Life During the Thaw,\\" Russian Studies in History 48, no. 1 (2009) 19. Through motion pictures from the United States, viewers learned of another way of life. The Kitchen Debate The Kitchen Debate at the 1959 Exhibition in Moscow fueled Khrushchev to catch up to Western consumerism. The \\"Khrushchev regime had promised abundance to secure its legitimacy.\\"Reid, Susan, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De- Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61, no. 2 (2002), 242. The ideology of strict functionality concerning material goods evolved into a more relaxed view of consumerism. American sociologist David Riesman coined the term \\"Operation Abundance\\" also known as the \\"Nylon War\\" which predicted \\"Russian people would not long tolerate masters who gave them tanks and spies instead of vacuum cleaners and beauty parlors.\\"David Riesman as quoted in Reid, Susan, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61, no. 2 (2002), 222. The Soviets would have to produce more consumer goods to quell mass discontent. Riesman's theory came true to some extent as the Soviet culture changed to include consumer goods such as vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and sewing machines. These items were specifically targeted at women in the Soviet Union with the idea that they relieved women of their domestic burden. Additionally an interest in changing the western image of a dowdy Russian woman led to the cultural acceptance of beauty products. The modern Russian woman wanted the clothing, cosmetics, and hairstyles available to Western women. Under the Thaw, beauty shops selling cosmetics and perfume, which had previously only been available to the wealthy, became available for common women.Reid, Susan, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61, no. 2 (2002), 233. Khrushchev's Response Khrushchev responded to consumerism more diplomatically than to cultural consumption. In response to American jazz Khrushchev stated: \\"I don't like jazz. When I hear jazz, it's as if I had gas on the stomach. I used to think it was static when I heard it on the radio.\\"Johnson, Priscilla, Khrushchev and the Arts (Cambridge: The M.I.T. Press, 1965), 102. Concerning commissioning artists during the Thaw, Khrushchev declared: \\"As long as I am president of the Council of Ministers, we are going to support a genuine art. We aren't going to give a kopeck for pictures painted by jackasses.\\" In comparison, the consumption of material goods acted as a measure of economic success. Khrushchev stated: \\"We are producing an ever-growing quantity of all kinds of consumer goods; all the same, we must not force the pace unreasonably as regards the lowering of prices. We don't want to lower prices to such an extent that there will be queues and a black market.\\"Reid, Susan, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61, no. 2 (2002), 237. Previously, excessive consumerism under Communism was seen as detrimental to the common good. Now, it was not enough for the consumer goods to be made more available; quality of consumer goods needed to be raised as well.Reid, Susan, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61, no. 2 (2002), 228. A misconception surrounding the quality of consumer goods existed because of advertising's role in the market. Advertising controlled sale quotas by increasing the desirability of surplus sub-standard goods.McKenzie, Brent, \\"The 1960s, the Central Department Store and Successful Soviet Consumerism: the Case of Tallinna Kaubamaja‚ÄîTallinn's \\"Department Store\\", \\"International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences 5, no.9 (2011), 45. Origins and outcome The roots of consumerism started as early as the 1930s when in 1935 each Soviet Republic capital city established a model department store.McKenzie, Brent, \\"The 1960s, the Central Department Store and Successful Soviet Consumerism: the Case of Tallinna Kaubamaja‚ÄîTallinn's \\"Department Store\\", \\"International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences 5, no.9 (2011), 41. The department stores acted as representatives of Soviet economic success. Under Khrushchev the retail sectors gained prevalence as Soviet department stores GUM (department store) and TsUM (Central Department Store), both located in Moscow, began to focus on trade and social interaction.McKenzie, Brent, \\"The 1960s, the Central Department Store and Successful Soviet Consumerism: the Case of Tallinna Kaubamaja‚ÄîTallinn's \\"Department Store\\", \\"International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences 5, no.9 (2011), 42. =An increase of private housing= On 31 July 1957 the Communist party decreed to increase housing construction and Khrushchev launched plans for building private apartments that differed from the old, communal apartments that had come before. Khrushchev stated that it was important \\"not only to provide people with good homes, but also to teach them‚Ä¶to live correctly.\\" He saw a high living standard as a precondition leading the path on the transition to full communism and believed that private apartments could achieve this.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific-Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 295. Although the Thaw marked a time of openness and liberalization primarily located in the public sphere, the emergence of private housing allowed for a new formulation of a private sphere in Soviet life.Susan E. Reid, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De- Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61 (2002), 244. This resulted in a changing ideology that needed to make room for women, who were traditionally associated with the home, and consumption of goods in order to create a well-ordered \\"Soviet\\" home.  A shift away from collective housing  Khrushchev's policies showed an interest in rebuilding the home and the family after the devastation of World War II. Soviet rhetoric exemplified a shift in emphasis from heavy industry to the importance of consumer goods and housing.Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61.2 (2002): 115-16. The Seven-Year Plan was launched in 1958 and promised to build 12 million city apartments and 7 million rural houses.Lynne Attwood, \\"Housing in the Khrushchev Era\\" in Women in the Khrushchev Era, Melanie Ilic, Susan E. Reid, and Lynne Attwood, eds., (Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 177. Alongside the increased number of private apartments was the emergence of changing attitudes toward the family. The prior Soviet ideology disdained conceptions of the traditional family, especially under Stalin, who created the vision of a large, collective family under his paternal leadership. The new emphasis on private housing created hope that the Thaw-era private realm would provide an escape from the intensities of public life and the eye of the government.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific-Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 289. Indeed, Khrushchev introduced the ideology that private life was valued and was ultimately a goal of social development.Iurii Gerchuk, \\"The Aesthetics of Everyday Life in the Khrushchev Thaw in the USSR (1954-64)\\" in Style and Socialism: Modernity and Material Culture in Post-War Eastern Europe, Susan E. Reid and David Crowley, eds., (Oxford: Berg, 2000), 88. The new political rhetoric regarding the family reintroduced the concept of the nuclear family, and, in doing so, cemented the idea that the women were responsible for the domestic realm and running the home. Recognizing the necessity of rebuilding the family in the postwar years, Khrushchev enacted policies that attempted to reestablish a more conventional domestic realm, moving away from the policies of his predecessors, and most of these were aimed at women.Natasha Kolchevska, \\"Angels in the Home and at Work: Russian Women in the Khrushchev Years,\\" Women's Studies Quarterly 33 (2005), 115-17. Despite being an active part of the workforce, women's conditions were considered by the western, capitalist world to exemplify the \\"backwardness\\" of the Soviet Union. This concept goes back to traditional Marxism, which found the roots of woman's inherent backwardness in fact that she was confined to the home; Lenin spoke of woman as a \\"domestic slave\\" who would remain in confinement as long as housework remained an activity for individuals inside the home. The prior abolition of private homes and the individual kitchen attempted to move away from the domestic regime that imprisoned women. Instead, the government tried to implement public dining, socialized housework, and collective childcare. These programs that fulfilled the original tenets of Marxism were widely resisted by traditionally-minded women.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific- Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 291-94. The individual kitchen In March 1958, Khrushchev admitted to the Supreme Soviet his embarrassment about the public perception of Soviet women as unhappily relegated to the ranks of a manual laborer.Susan E. Reid, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61 (2002), 224. The new private housing provided individual kitchens for many families for the first time. The new technologies of the kitchen came to be associated with the projects of modernization in the era of the Cold War's \\"peaceful competition.\\" In this time, the primary competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was the battle of providing the better quality of life.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific-Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 289-95. In 1959, at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, U.S. Vice-President Richard Nixon declared the superiority of the capitalist system while standing in front of an example of a modern American kitchen. Known as the \\"Kitchen Debate,\\" the exchange between Nixon and Khrushchev foreshadowed Khrushchev's increased attention to the needs of women, especially by creating modern kitchens. While affirming his dedication to increasing the living standard, Khrushchev associated the transition to communism with abundance and prosperity.Susan E. Reid, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61 (2002), 223-24. The Third Party Programme of 1961, the defining document of Khrushchev's policies, related social progress with technological progress, especially technological progress inside the home. Khrushchev spoke of a commitment to increasing production of consumer goods, specifically household goods and appliances that would decrease the intensity of housework. The kitchen was defined as a \\"workshop\\" that relied on the \\"correct organization of labour\\" to be most efficient. Creating what were perceived to be the best conditions for the woman's work in the kitchen was an attempt on the part of the government to ensure that the Soviet woman would be able to continue her labor inside and outside of the home. Despite the increasing demands of housework, women were expected to maintain jobs outside the home in order to sustain the national economy as well as fulfill the ideals of a Soviet well-rounded individual.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific-Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 290-303. During this time, women were flooded with pamphlets and magazines teeming with advice on how best to run a household. This literature emphasized the virtues of simplicity and efficiency.Susan E. Reid, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De-Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61 (2002), 244-49. Additionally, furniture was designed to suit the average height of Moscow women, emphasizing a modern, simple style that allowed for efficient mass production. However, in the newly built apartments of the Khrushchev era, the individual kitchens were rarely up to the standards invoked by the government's rhetoric. Providing fully fitted kitchens were too expensive and time-consuming to be realized in the mass housing project.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific-Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 315. Design of the home The streamlined, simple design and aesthetic of the kitchen was promoted throughout the rest of the home.Susan E. Reid, \\"The Khrushchev Kitchen: Domesticating the Scientific-Technological Revolution,\\" Journal of Contemporary History 40 (2005), 308-309. Previous styles were labeled as petit-bourgeois once Khrushchev came to power.Susan E. Reid, \\"Women in the Home\\" in Women in the Khrushchev Era, Melanie Ilic, Susan E. Reid, and Lynne Attwood, eds., (Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 153. Khrushchev denounced the ornate style of high Stalinism for its wastefulness.Susan E. Reid, \\"Destalinization and Taste, 1953-1963,\\" Journal of Design History, 10 (1997), 177-78. The arrangement of the home during the Thaw emphasized that which was simple and functional, for those items could be easily mass-produced. Khrushchev promoted a culture of increased consumption and publicly announced that the per capita consumption of the Soviet Union would exceed that of the United States. However, consumption consisted of modern goods that lacked decorative qualities and were often poor quality, which spoke to the society's emphasis on production rather than consumption.Susan E. Reid, \\"Cold War in the Kitchen: Gender and the De- Stalinization of Consumer Taste in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev,\\" Slavic Review 61 (2002), 216-243. Khrushchev's dismissal and the end of reforms Both the cultural and the political thaws were effectively ended with the removal of Khrushchev as Soviet leader in October 1964, and the installment of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1964. When Khrushchev was dismissed, Alexei Kosygin took over Khrushchev's position as Soviet Premier, but Kosygin's economic reform was not successful and hardline communists led by Brezhnev blocked any motions for reforms after Kosygin's failed attempt. Brezhnev began his career as the General Secretary with the Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel trial in 1965, which showed the establishment of an authoritarian ideology. After that, Brezhnev approved the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and ended with the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War which continued after his death; he installed an authoritarian regime that lasted throughout his life and the lives of his two successors, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.

History repeated Many historians compare Khrushchev's Thaw and his massive efforts to change the Soviet society and move away from its past, with Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost during the 1980s. Although they led the Soviet Union in different eras, both Khrushchev and Gorbachev had initiated dramatic reforms. Both efforts lasted only a few years and were supported by the people, while being opposed by the hard-liners. Both leaders were dismissed, albeit with completely different results for their country. Mikhail Gorbachev has called Khrushchev's achievements remarkable; he praised Khrushchev's 1956 speech, but stated that Khrushchev did not succeed in his reforms.

Today it is published monthly, mailed to all SPD members. History The paper was founded as a merger of the Eisenacher's Der Volksstaat and the Lasalleans Der Socialdemokrat (General German Workers' Association). Its first editors were Wilhelm Hasenclever and Wilhelm Liebknecht. Friedrich Engels and Kurt Tucholsky both wrote for Vorw√§rts. It backed the Russian Marxist economists and then, after the split in the Party, the Mensheviks. It published articles by Leon Trotsky, but would not publish any by Vladimir Lenin. During the First World War Vorw√§rts opposed the SPD's Burgfriedenspolitik in favour of pacifism and neutrality until 1916 when, some time after Rudolf Hilferding had been drafted into the Austrian army, Friedrich Stampfer was introduced as editor- in-chief. He guided the central organ back towards the party line (prompting accusations from half of the Socialist camp that it had become chauvinist).

Rudolf attended a public gymnasium from which he graduated as an average student, allowing him access to the university. Directly afterwards, he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study medicine.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding, Dietz, 2000. . p. 14. Even before his school leaving examinations, in 1893 he joined a group of Vienna students that weekly discussed socialist literature and later formed with young university teachers the student-organization Freie Vereinigung Sozialistischer Studenten, whose chairman was Max Adler. This is where Hilferding first intensely came in contact with socialist theories and first became active in the labour movement. The organization also participated in social-democratic demonstrations, which came in conflict with the police, drawing the attention of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ).William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 15.

She also had a Jewish background, had made her exams at the University of Vienna, and was a regular contributor to Die Neue Zeit. Margarete gave birth to their 1st child, Karl Emil. Kautsky worried that Hilferding, who now complained about his lack of time, would neglect his theoretical work in favor of his good social situation as a doctor in Vienna. Kautsky used his connections to August Bebel, who was looking for teachers for the SPD's training center in Berlin, to suggest Hilferding for this position. In July 1906, Bebel recommended Hilferding for this job to the party executive, which agreed to give it to him for six months.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 41, 42. = Life in Berlin and World War I = In 1906, he gave up his job as a doctor and, following August Bebel's call, started teaching Economics and Economic history at the training center of the SPD in Berlin. Having arrived in Berlin in November 1906, he taught there for one term, but a law forbade the employment of teachers without German citizenship. He had to give up this job and was replaced by Rosa LuxemburgWilliam Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 50. after being threatened with eviction by the Prussian police in 1907. Until 1915, he was the foreign editor of the leading SPD newspaper Vorw√§rts, in the immediate proximity of the most important party leaders.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 47. Bebel had recommended Hilferding for this job, after there was a conflict between the editors of Vorw√§rts and the party executive. His appointment was also meant to raise the share of marxism in the editing. In a short time, Hilferding took a leading role in the paper and was soon appointed editor-in-chief.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 51. Together with his work for Die Neue Zeit and Der Kampf, it provided him an adequate income. He was also supported by his fellow Austrian, Karl Kautsky, who was his mentor and whom he succeeded in the 1920s as the chief theoretician of the SPD.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 46. Hilferding's theoretical abilities and his personal relationships to leading socialists allowed him to make his career in the party. He published his most famous work, Das Finanzkapital (Finance Capital), in 1910, which was an important theoretical milestone that has kept its importance until today.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 52. It built Hilferding's reputation as a significant economist, a leading economist theoretician of the Socialist International, and, together with his leading position in Vorw√§rts, helped him raise into the national decision level of the SPD. It also confirmed his position in the marxist center of the SPD, of which he was now one of the most important figures. Since 1912 he represented Vorw√§rts at the meetings of the party commission, which allowed him to decisively take part in the decision-making of the socialist politics in the years before World War I.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 70, 71. When World War I broke out in 1914, Hilferding was one of the few social democrats who from the very start opposed the SPD's Burgfriedenspolitik and the party's support for the German war effort, including its vote for war loans. In an internal party vote, he was only one of a small minority, led by Hugo Haase, a close friend of his, and thus they had to yield to the party's decision to support the Reichstag motion on the war loans. Hilferding, together with the majority of the editors of Vorw√§rts, signed a declaration to oppose these policies.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 77, 78. In October 1915, the SPD leadership fired all these opposing editors, but Hilferding had already been drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army as a medic long before.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 85. At first, Hilferding was stationed in Vienna, where he led the field hospital for epidemics. He lived together with his wife and his two sons, Karl and Peter, who was born in 1908. Thanks to his correspondence with Kautsky, he got news about the party. Then, in 1916, he was sent to Steinach am Brenner, near the Italian border, as a combat medic. During the whole war, Hilferding remained active in writing and was politically involved. He published numerous articles in Die Neue Zeit and Kampf.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 85, 86. One of these articles, published in October 1915, summarized the situation of the SPD and revised his theories of Finance Capital containing his first formulation of the concept of organized capitalism.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 87. = Weimar Republic = Hilferding joined the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) in 1918. During the November Revolution in 1918, he returned to Berlin, shortly after the Republic was proclaimed and the emperor had fled.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 96. For the following three years, he was editor-in-chief of the USPD's daily newspaper, Die Freiheit, and thus member of the party executive. The Freiheit quickly became one of Berlin's most widely read dailies with a circulation of 200,000.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 114. Later, Kurt Tucholsky bashed him for his work for the newspaper in Die Weltb√ºhne in 1925. The Council of the People's Deputies, the provisional government of the November Revolution, consisting of members of the SPD and USPD, which had signed the cease-fire, delegated Hilferding to the Sozialisierungskommission (Socialization Committee). Its official task was to socialize suitable industries. He spent months with this project, which was, in spite of support among the workers, not a priority for the government. In fact, the SPD leadership opposed socialization at this point since the armistice, demobilisation of the army and feeding the German people seemed more pressing issues at the time. Hilferding gave a speech before the Reichsr√§tekongress (worker's councils' congress) and presented a plan to socialize industry. It went down well with the congress and a resolution was passed, but the government largely ignored it. The government's lack of support was the reason why this committee was disbanded in April 1919.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 107, 108. After the Kapp-L√ºttwitz-Putsch, the government, under pressure, appointed a new Socialization Committee, of which Hilferding was again a member, but the government was still not keen to pursue a course of socialization.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 112, 114. Tensions between the SPD and USPD escalated when Friedrich Ebert used troops to suppress riots in Berlin on 23 December 1918 without consulting the USPD. To protest the policies of the Council, the USPD withdrew its three representatives from the government. Hilferding, who had accused the SPD of trying to oust the USPD from government, supported this decision. After a poor performance of the USPD in the elections for the Weimar National Assembly, leading USPD politicians, including Hilferding, started to support workers' councils. Hilferding wrote articles in the Freiheit and made suggestions how they should be implemented,William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 101. which were sharply criticized by Lenin.William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding. p. 104. Hilferding disagreed with the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, and opposed the October Revolution. He later described the USSR as \\"the first totalitarian state\\" and a \\"totalitarian state economy\\". In 1919, he acquired German citizenship and in 1920, he was appointed to the Reich Economic Council. In 1922, he strongly opposed a merger of the USPD with the Communist Party of Germany, which he attacked throughout the 1920s, and instead supported the merger with the SPD, where he emerged as its most prominent and visible spokesperson. At the peak of the inflation in the Weimar Republic, he served as the German Minister of Finance from August to October 1923. He contributed to stabilizing the mark, but was unable to stop the inflation. During his term of office, the introduction of the Rentenmark was decided, but he resigned from office shortly before the monetary reform took place. From 1924 to 1933, he was publisher of the theoretical journal Die Gesellschaft. On 4 May 1924, he was elected to the Reichstag for the SPD where he served as the SPD's chief spokesman on financial matters until 1933. Together with Karl Kautsky he formulated the Heidelberg Program in 1925. Between 1928 and 1929, he again served as finance minister, on the eve of the Great Depression. He had to relinquish this position because of pressure from the President of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, causing his fall in December 1929 by imposing to the government his conditions for the obtainment of a loan. = Life in exile = After Hitler's coming to power, Hilferding as a prominent socialist and Jew had to flee into exile in 1933, together with his close associate Rudolf Breitscheid and other important party leaders, first to Denmark, then Saarbr√ºcken, Paris, and finally Zurich, Switzerland. He lived in Zurich until 1938 and from 1939 on in Paris, France. However, he remained influential, having been appointed to important posts in SPD's Sopade. Between 1933 and 1936, he was editor-in-chief of Die Zeitschrift f√ºr Sozialismus and contributor to Neuer Vorw√§rts. Until 1939 he was also the party's representative for the Socialist International and his advice was sought by the SPD leadership in exile. After the attack on France he and Breitscheid fled to unoccupied Marseille. Efforts were undertaken by the Refugee Committee, under Varian Fry, to get him out of Vichy France, along with Rudolf Breitscheid. However, they both refused to leave illegally, because they didn't have identification papers. They were arrested by the police of the Vichy government in southern France and, despite their emergency visa to enter the United States of America, handed over to the Gestapo on 9 February 1941. Hilferding was brought to Paris and was severely maltreated on the way. After being tortured, he died of unknown causes in a prison in Paris, the Gestapo dungeon of La Sant√©. http://www.oekonomie-klassiker.de/biographien/pagegh.php His death was not officially announced until the fall of 1941. Fry, among others, believed that Hilferding was murdered by the Gestapo on the orders of Adolf Hitler or another senior Nazi Party official. Hilferding's wife, Margarete, died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942.  Finance Capital  Finanzkapital, 1923 Hilferding's Finance Capital (Das Finanzkapital, Vienna: 1910) was \\"the seminal Marxist analysis of the transformation of competitive and pluralistic 'liberal capitalism' into monopolistic 'finance capital'\\",Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change, Routledge, 1998. hardback, paper. p. 356. and anticipated Lenin's and Bukharin's \\"largely derivative\\" writings on the subject.Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 361. Writing in the context of the highly cartelized economy of late Austria-Hungary,Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 357‚Äì359. Hilferding contrasted monopolistic finance capitalism to the earlier, \\"competitive\\" and \\"buccaneering\\" capitalism of the earlier liberal era. The unification of industrial, mercantile and banking interests had defused the earlier liberal capitalist demands for the reduction of the economic role of a mercantilist state; instead, finance capital sought a \\"centralized and privilege-dispensing state\\".Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 359. Hilferding saw this as part of the inevitable concentration of capital called for by Marxian economics, rather than a deviation from the free market. Whereas, until the 1860s, the demands of capital and of the bourgeoisie had been, in Hilferding's view, constitutional demands that had \\"affected all citizens alike,\\" finance capital increasingly sought state intervention on behalf of the wealth-owning classes; capitalists, rather than the nobility, now dominated the state.Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 359‚Äì360. In this, Hilferding saw an opportunity for a path to socialism that was distinct from the one foreseen by Marx: \\"The socializing function of finance capital facilitates enormously the task of overcoming capitalism. Once finance capital has brought the most importance (sic) branches of production under its control, it is enough for society, through its conscious executive organ ‚Äì the state conquered by the working class ‚Äì to seize finance capital in order to gain immediate control of these branches of production.\\"\\"Rudolph Hilferding. Finance Capital: A Study of the Latest Phase of Capitalist Development. Chapter 25, The proletariat and imperialism. http://www.marxists.org/archive/hilferding/1910/finkap/ch25.htm\\" This would make it unnecessary to expropriate \\"peasant farms and small businesses\\" because they would be indirectly socialized, through the socialization of institutions upon which finance capital had already made them dependent. Thus, because a narrow class dominated the economy, socialist revolution could gain wider support by directly expropriating only from that narrow class. In particular, according to Hilferding, societies that had not reached the level of economic maturity anticipated by Marx as making them \\"ripe\\" for socialism could be opened to socialist possibilities.Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 360. Furthermore, \\"the policy of finance capital is bound to lead towards war, and hence to the unleashing of revolutionary storms.\\"Quoted in Bideleux and Jeffries, p. 360.

The immiseration thesis is related to Marx's analysis of the rising organic composition of capital and reduced demand for labor relative to capital equipment as technology develops.  Karl Marx  In Karl Marx's early writings of the 1840s, he was influenced by David Ricardo's theory of wages, which held that wages tended down to a subsistence minimum. This was the \\"Iron law of wages\\" coined by the socialist Ferdinand Lassalle. In On the Question of Free Trade (1847), Marx wrote: \\"Thus, as means are constantly being found for the maintenance of labor on cheaper and more wretched food, the minimum of wages is constantly sinking.\\" This implied an absolute decline in living standards. However, Marx changed his position in the 1850s. In the first volume of Capital, chapter 25, section 4, he instead suggested instead a relative immiseration of workers vis-√†-vis capital occurred. Concerning the evolution of the worker's conditions, he wrote: Marx argued that, in accordance with the labour theory of value, capitalist competition would necessitate the gradual replacement of workers with machines, allowing an increase in productivity, but with less overall value for each product produced, as more products can be made in a given amount of time. This process forms part of the general law of capitalist accumulation, in which the proportion of \\"constant capital\\" increases relative to \\"variable capital\\" (i.e. workers) in the production process over time. Marx also noted that this movement is not merely an abstract relation, but that it is a result of class struggle, and it could be temporarily stopped should wages dip below an amount that the proletariat deem acceptable.  Diverging views  Raymond Geuss asks: \\"What if capitalism came to be capable of raising the standard of living of the workers rather than further depressing it? A trade union consciousness could then establish itself that was not inherently and irrevocably revolutionary, one that was itself, as Lenin claimed, a form of bourgeois ideology, that is, a form of consciousness that was itself a means through which the bourgeoisie could extend and solidify its domination over the working class.\\"Geuss, Raymond (2004): Dialectics and the revolutionary impulse. In Rush, Fred, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Critical Theory. Cambridge University Press. p. 113. = Frankfurt School = The immiseration thesis was equally questioned by later theorists, notably by early members of the Frankfurt School. For Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, state intervention in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the \\"relations of production\\" and \\"material productive forces of society\\"‚Äîa tension which, according to traditional Marxist theory, constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously \\"free\\" market (as an \\"unconscious\\" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and \\"irrevocable\\" private property of Marx's epoch have gradually been replaced by the centralized state planning and socialized ownership of the means of production in contemporary Western societies. The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is thus suppressed, effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination: \\"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism.\\"Horkheimer, Max and Theodor Adorno. (2002). Dialectic of Enlightenment, p. 38. = Relative immiseration = When it became clear that the conditions of the working class were not growing worse in objective terms (for example, wages continued to rise and living conditions improved), it was suggested that Marx did not believe the working class would be immiserated in absolute terms but rather in relative terms i.e. the worker would become more exploited. However, Neven Sesardic criticises this view on two grounds. Firstly, it is unclear if this is an empirical statement that can actually be examined, whereas absolute immiseration can be. Secondly, Sesardic argues that it is not clear Marx did mean relative immiseration; Sesardic observes that in the Communist Manifesto, Marx talks about the workers having nothing to lose but their chains, which is more in line with the view of absolute immiseration. Even by 1865 when Marx had moved towards a more scientific analysis, his work still implied absolute immiseration. In the 1865 paper \\"Value, Price and Profit\\", read at the International Workers' Association, Marx states that capitalism will drive down the average standard of wages.Sesardiƒá, Neven. \\"Marxian Utopia.\\" (1985), pp.34-35  See also  * Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory) * Crisis theory * Technological unemployment * Unfree labour * Wage labour * Wage slavery  References  Capitalism Labour economics Marxian economics Socialism ","title":"Immiseration thesis"},{"id":"38646907","text":"Red October is another name for the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia.

Lewis's father, a successful builder and architect, came from a Welsh farming family, and was a very devout Methodist. Young Lewis's social and political views clashed with those of his father. Their quarrels eventually led to his father disinheriting him. Education and religious work Lewis attended Dulwich College and University College London, where he earned his B.Sc. Having been raised a Methodist, he soon left that church to become a Congregationalist. He studied for the ministry at Cambridge, and in 1916 was appointed to a Presbyterian church in Gravesend, Kent; in 1924, he moved to a church in Birmingham. He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Birmingham, specialising in the philosophy of Karl Marx, and becoming a Marxist himself. By 1929, his left wing views were too strong for the church he was in and he moved to Ipswich as a Unitarian minister. Here, his leftist political sermons attracted a large youth following, but upset a group of older, more conservative members. Their complaints led Lewis to offer his resignation, to be put to a vote of the membership. In a packed and charged meeting, he received the support of the majority of church members. Political and social activism Lewis participated in anti-war political activity starting in 1916. On one occasion, he had to be rescued from an angry crowd. He also became involved in work to support the unemployed, and served on the local Trades Union Council. On one occasion, at Christmas, he led a group of unemployed men who marched to the Town Hall, where the Mayor was holding his formal Christmas dinner. They walked in and sat down, demanding to join the feast. He also was involved with the Boy Scout movement, running a Scout troop, and authoring training booklets. He acted as a guide for outdoor holidays organised by the Holiday Fellowship. He often went to Switzerland, and took parties up the Matterhorn. In the 1935 General Election he stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for Great Yarmouth. Leftist politics The Bolshevik Revolution had a great effect on Lewis, and he studied Russian. He became a Christian Socialist, and later a Marxist. In 1936 the Left Book Club, started by the publisher Victor Gollancz, was very popular. Lewis quit his ministry in Ipswich to take on the task of building a national network of discussion groups. The groups brought together in a progressive movement intelligent, literate people who had not found rewarding political action in leftwing parties. Soon there were groups in every town. In effect, the Left Book Club and its groups had become a quasi-political party. He also became the editor of the British Marxist journal, Modern Quarterly, from 1946‚Äì1953. He was very interested in polemical writing, and authored many books and articles in a polemical vein on topics of philosophy, social issues, and Marxism. In one exchange of polemics, he took on the French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser. Althusser's part of the exchange is the article \\"Reply to John Lewis\\". \\"Reply to John Lewis\\" first appeared, translated by Grahame Lock, in two numbers of the theoretical and political journal of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Marxism Today, in October and November 1972. As Althusser himself noted: \\" \\"Reply\\": because, a few months earlier (in its January and February numbers of 1972), the same journal had published a long critical article by John Lewis (a British Communist philosopher known for his interventions in political-ideological questions) under the title: \\"The Althusser Case\\".\\"This article was republished by Althusser in his Essays in Self-Criticism, now available in an online version. Miscellaneous During World War II Lewis was a lecturer for the British Army, working with the Army Education Corps and the Army Bureau of Current Affairs and lecturing on, among other things, Britain's wartime ally, the Soviet Union. He also taught at several different schools, including a stint teaching biology at Morley College, an adult education college in London.

The Ministry is responsible for infrastructure policy and development throughout the country. Claver Gatete is the current Minister of Infrastructure in the Government of the Republic of Rwanda. Prior to that, he has served his Government in different capacities; Minister of Finance and Economic Planning (2013-2018); Governor of the Central Bank of Rwanda (2011-2013) and High Commissioner to the UK, Ireland and Iceland,(2005 - 2009).  History  The ministry was founded after Rwandan independence in 1962 as the Ministry for Technical Businesses. Three years later it was renamed to the Ministry of Public services. Following the military coup which brought President Juvenal Habyarimana to power, the ministry was renamed again to the Ministry of Public Services and Energy. It retained this name until 1980, when it was expanded to include a water remit. The Ministry of Public Services was retained after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, reverting first to its former title of Ministry of Public Services and Energy, from 1994 then back to its 1960s title of Ministry of Public Services (MINITRAP) in 1997 and to the new name of Ministry of Public Services, Transport and Communication in 1999. The Ministry gained its current name Ministry of Infrastructure in 2002. The Ministry is headed by the Minister of Infrastructure.

He was known for diverging from classical Marxism in his breakdown of the working class into subgroups of diversely held power and therefore varying degrees of class consciousness. Wright introduced novel concepts to adapt to this change of perspective including deep democracy and interstitial revolution.  Personal life and career  Erik Olin Wright was born on February 9, 1947, in Berkeley, California though he was raised in Lawrence, Kansas. Wright's parents were both psychology professors at the University of Kansas. His parents were both Jewish. He received two B.A. degrees, one from Harvard College in 1968, and one from Balliol College, University of Oxford in 1970. Wright received a Ph.D. from University of California, Berkeley in 1976. He became a Professor of Sociology at University of Wisconsin - Madison in 1976. Wright began making contributions to the intellectual community in the mid-1970s, along with a whole generation of young academics who were radicalized by the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wright supervised the dissertations of numerous young scholars who proceeded to become notable sociologists and politicians, among whom are included Wilmot James, C√©sar Rodr√≠guez Garavito, and Vivek Chibber. Wright also served on the dissertation committees of scholars who go on to make considerable contributions to the fields of social stratification, social policy, and inequality including G√∏sta Esping-Andersen, former American Sociological Association president Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, and the late Devah Pager. Throughout Wright's career, he was solicited by other universities to join their sociology faculty. One notable such recruitment attempt occurred at Harvard University in 1981. Among Wright's supporters were Harrison White, who respected Wright's work despite opposition to Wright's Marxist political commitments. Wright's opponents at Harvard included Daniel Bell and George Homans, as well as university president Derek Bok who purportedly blocked the department's attempt to recruit Wright. Harvard's attempt to recruit Wright coincided with its decision to deny tenure in 1981 to Theda Skocpol, a decision that was later reversed following controversy over accusations of gender discrimination. In 2012, Wright was elected President of the American Sociological Association. Wright died on January 23, 2019, from acute myeloid leukemia at a hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, aged 71. Wright was also an avid fiddle player, often encouraging guests to square dance at parties.  Thought = Social classes = Wright has been described as an \\"influential new left theorist\\". His work was concerned mainly with the study of social classes, and in particular with the task of providing an update to and elaboration of the Marxist concept of class, in order to enable Marxist and non-Marxist researchers alike to use \\"class\\" to explain and predict people's material interests, lived experiences, living conditions, incomes, organizational capacities and willingness to engage in collective action, political leanings, and so on. In addition, he attempted to develop class categories that would allow researchers to compare and contrast the class structures and dynamics of different advanced capitalist and \\"post- capitalist\\" societies. Wright has stressed the importance of: # control over and exclusion from access to economic/productive resources; # location within production relations; # market capacity in exchange relations; # differential control over income derived from the use of productive resources; and, # differential control over labor effort in defining 'class', while at the same time trying to account for the situation of expert, skilled, manager, and supervisory employees, taking inspiration from Weberian accounts of class and class analysis. According to Wright, employees with sought-after and reward- inelastically supplied skills (due to natural scarcities or socially constructed and imposed restrictions on supply, such as licensing, barriers to entry into training programs, etc.) are in a \\"privileged [surplus] appropriation location within exploitation relations\\" because, while they are not capitalists, they are able to obtain more privileges through their relation to the owner of the means of production than less skilled workers and harder to monitor and evaluate in terms of labor effort. The owner(s) of the means of production or their employer in general therefore has to pay them a \\"scarcity\\" or \\"skill/credential\\" rent (thus raising their compensation above the actual cost of producing and reproducing their labor power) and tries to \\"buy\\" their loyalty by giving them ownership stakes, endowing them with delegated authority over their fellow workers and/or allowing them to more or less be autonomous in determining the pace and direction of their work. Thus, experts, managers of experts, and executive managers tend to be closer to the interests of the employers than to other workers. Erik Olin Wright's books include Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis (Cambridge, 1997), which uses data collected in various industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, Norway, and Sweden. He was a professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison until his death. = Real utopias = Later in his career, Wright was associated with a renewed understanding of a socialist alternative, deeply rooted on social associativism. The transition to this alternative, according to Wright, depends on designing and building \\"real utopias\\", the name of a research project and book of his. Examples of \\"real utopias\\" that counter prevailing institutions by advancing democratic and egalitarian principles, thereby pointing in the direction of a more just and humane world, include Wikipedia and the Mondragon Corporation.

Lundstrom is an American electrical engineering researcher, educator, and author. He is known for contributions to the theory, modeling, and understanding of semiconductor devices, especially nanoscale transistors, and as the creator of the nanoHUB, a major online resource for nanotechnology. Lundstrom is Don and Carol Scifres Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and acting dean of the College of Engineering at Purdue University.  Early Life and Education  Lundstrom was born and grew up in Alexandria, Minnesota and graduated from high school in 1969. He received his BEE from the University of Minnesota in 1973. As an undergraduate student, he was introduced to research by working in the laboratory of Aldert van der Ziel. Lundstrom received an MSEE degree from the University of Minnesota in 1974 for research on surface acoustic wave devices. He was a Member of the Technical Staff at Hewlett Packard Corporation in Colorado where he worked on integrated circuit process development. Lundstrom received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University in 1980 for research on silicon solar cells. His thesis advisor was Richard J. Schwartz, inventor of the Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) solar cell. In 1980, Lundstrom joined Purdue University.  Career  Lundstrom‚Äôs research focuses on understanding current flow in electronic devices. He has conducted studies on the theory, modeling, and numerical simulation of charge carrier transport in semiconductor devices ‚Äì especially devices with dimensions at the nanoscale. He is the author of Fundamentals of Carrier Transport (Addison-Wesley, 1990), the second edition of which (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000) has become a standard reference on charge carrier transport in semiconductors. Lundstrom‚Äôs most important contribution is a conceptual model for nanoscale transistors backed up with rigorous numerical simulations, and elaborated in his books Fundamentals of Nanotransistors (World Scientific, 2017) and Nanoscale Transistors - Device Physics, Modeling and Simulation (Springer, 2006) as well as numerous journal articles. He has also contributed to the understanding, modeling and design of other semiconductor devices. His early work focused on heterostructure devices, namely solar cells and bipolar transistors. In 1994, with his student Greg Lush, he proposed the use of photon recycling to increase the efficiency of GaAs solar cells‚Äîa concept that later produced record efficiencies in single junction solar cells. His recent work extends his approach to electronic transport to thermal transport by phonons and coupled electro- thermal transport, effects that are important in the design and analysis of thermoelectric devices. In 1995 with his colleagues Nirav Kapadia and Jose A.B. Fortes, Lundstrom created PUNCH ‚Äì the Purdue University Network Computing Hub, which provided access to scientific simulations through a web browser, and was an early example of cloud computing. As founding director of the National Science Foundation-funded Network for Computational Nanotechnology, Lundstrom created the nanoHUB in 2000. The nanoHUB has grown into a major online resource for nanoelectronics, offering researchers, educators and students online access to sophisticated electronic device simulations as well as open-content educational resources. Most of the one million plus annual visitors to the nanoHUB access its educational resources. Lundstrom is a major contributor to nanoHUB content. More than 500,000 individuals have viewed his seminars, tutorials, and courses on nanoHUB.org. In 2012, Lundstrom launched nanoHUB-U to provide free, online short courses on topics that were not yet widely taught. The goal of nanoHUB-U is to help students and working engineers acquire the breadth needed for the increasingly diverse electronics of the 21st Century ‚Äì without requiring a long string of prerequisites. To complement nanoHUB-U, Lundstrom established the Lessons from Nanoscience Lecture Notes Series (World Scientific). In addition to bringing new content into the curriculum, the goal was to re-think the way traditional topics are understood so that working from the nanoscale to the system scale is seamless and intuitive. On December 12, 2019, Lundstrom was named acting dean of the College of Engineering at Purdue University.  Awards  Lundstrom is the recipient of numerous awards. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2009 ‚ÄúFor leadership in microelectronics and nanoelectronics through research, innovative education, and unique applications of cyberinfrastructure.‚Äù He was elected Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1994 and elevated to Life Fellow status in 2017. Lundstrom was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) in 2000 ‚ÄúFor insights into the physics of carrier transport in small semiconductor devices and the development of simple, conceptual models for nanoscale transistors.‚Äù He was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2006 ‚ÄúFor outstanding contributions in the area of simulating nanoscale metal-oxide-field-effect transistors, and for providing these simulations to users worldwide through the Internet.‚Äù In 2014, Lundstrom was included on the Thomson Reuters Corporation's list of The World‚Äôs Most Influential Scientific Minds.

It is located in north-west central Toronto where the Don Valley Parkway intersects with Lawrence Avenue East. It was the location of pioneer Alexander Milne's mill town known as Milnesford Mills and his homestead farm. Today it is dominated by transportation uses, (including two rail lines, an expressway and an arterial road) with parkland alongside. The parkland has seen recent naturalization efforts by the City of Toronto government and volunteer organizations, including the opening of the East Don Trail in 2012. Description Milne Hollow is a wide section of the valley of the East Don River. It was first inhabited by Europeans in the 19th century. The Milne family set up a pioneer farm and mill on the river. The river itself flows from the north-west to the south-east of the hollow. To the north-west and south-east, the river floodplains are forested. Along the south and west slopes of the hollow, the Canadian National rail line crosses the hollow, following the river valley. Along north-south lines, the Don Valley Parkway descends into the hollow where a large interchange exists for access to Lawrence Avenue, an arterial road crossing the hollow on an east-west direction. Other than transportation uses, the hollow is in a natural state. In the south-east quadrant is Moccasin Creek Park. Along the river, and occupying the east bank of the river and the south-east quadrant of the valley is the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which continues to the south-east along the East Don River. Milnesford Mills The small village of Milneford Mills was located along Lawrence Avenue at its crossing of the river. The Milne family moved to the site in 1832, moving its mill operations from the Milne farm located further to the west (the property known as Edwards Gardens today), due to low flows of water. In 1846, Milne built a woolen mill. In 1878, the entire mill village was swept away by a flood but the Milnes decided to rebuild. The woolen mill operated into the 20th century before being abandoned. The mill building was demolished years later in 1946 to re-use its bricks. The floods of Hurricane Hazel in 1954 destroyed what was left of the mill site and buildings. One house remained and it was used for the Civic Gardens Centre (today known as the Toronto Botanical Garden) until the 1960s. Don Valley Parkway project As the Greater Toronto Area grew in population after World War II, the Province of Ontario set up a special regional government in Toronto known as Metropolitan Toronto to build and manage the infrastructure for the growing suburbs. One of Metro's priority projects upon its founding in 1954, was the construction of the Don Valley Parkway expressway from downtown Toronto to the Ontario Highway 401. The route chosen followed the lower Don valley to the forks of the Don River, then proceeded north along the 'right-of-way' assigned to Woodbine Avenue in the grid layout of Toronto. This crossed the valley of the East Don at Lawrence, which was a dirt road at the time. As part of Metro's road-building project, Lawrence was expanded to a six-lane arterial road through Milne Hollow. A cloverleaf-style interchange with the DVP was constructed, the interchange necessitating the removal of the rest of the Milne buildings except for a house on the east bank of the river, south-east of the interchange. The East Don also crossed Lawrence at the same point as the interchange, and roadways were built around the existing path of the river. The river channel was itself 'channelized' using concrete and fill for flood control through the interchange. The river channel south-east of the parkway was mostly preserved, except for the use of concrete fill to curb erosion. Don Valley Ski Centre The eastern slope, just south of Lawrence Avenue, was used for downhill skiing. The facility was known as the Don Valley Ski Centre and was run by the Don Valley Ski Club. The centre featured three lifts - two rope and one Poma. When the snow was unreliable, the centre used its $70,000 artificial snow-making machine. Lift passes were between $3 and $5. Opened in the 1950s, the facility closed in the 1970s. Some of the remains of the facility still exist. It is located on the eastern slope Today In 2012, the East Don Trail was extended north through the Charles Sauriol Reserve along the east bank of the Don River up to Lawrence Avenue and Milne Hollow.

Born and graduated in Italy, he obtained his PhD (1991) and habilitation (1996) from the Free University of Berlin. From 1997 to 2014, he was professor of Jewish Studies at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Since 2014, he is professor of Jewish philosophy and religion at the University of Hamburg and director of the Maimonides Centre for Advanced StudiesMaimonides-centre.uni-hamburg.de as well as director of the Academy of World Religions in Hamburg since 2017.  Career  Giuseppe Veltri was born in San Giovanni in Fiore, Calabria, Italy. From 1978 to 1983, he studied philosophy and theology in Siena and Viterbo. After obtaining his diploma at the Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm, he studied biblical criticism at the Pontifical Biblical Institute (1983‚Äì1986). In Rome, his mentor was the Targum researcher Roger Le D√©aut. In 1990, he moved to the Free University of Berlin, where he studied with the expert on Jewish studies and eminent scholar in comparative religion, Peter Sch√§fer and the religious historian and theologian Carsten Colpe. Both significantly influenced his development as a scholar. From 1990 to 1996, he worked on the project Magic from the Cairo Geniza and the project Greek-Roman Religion in Palestine (financed by the German Research Foundation, and headed by Peter Sch√§fer). In 1991, he completed his PhD on the concept of translation in Jewish-Hellenistic and rabbinical contexts.Eine Tora f√ºr den K√∂nig Talmai. Untersuchungen zum √úbersetzungsverst√§ndnis in der j√ºdisch-hellenistischen und rabbinischen Literatur, Texte und Studien zum Antiken Judentum 41 (T√ºbingen: Mohr 1994). He then obtained a habilitation in Jewish studies at the Free University of Berlin (1996). The topic of this habil. thesis, which is still cited today as an important study,Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 25 May 2011, No. 121, p. N3, \\"Passworte,\\" by Lorenz J√§ger. is the connection between magic, law and the history of science.Magie und Halakha. Ans√§tze zu einem empirischen Wissenschaftsbegriff im sp√§tantiken und fr√ºhmittelalterlichen Judentum, Texte und Studien zum antiken Judentum 62 (T√ºbingen: Mohr 1997). Giuseppe Veltri was offered a professorship at the University of Halle-Wittenberg, where he was appointed Professor for Jewish studies in 1997. In 2013, Giuseppe Veltri was offered the chair of Jewish religion and philosophy at Hamburg University.Forschung und Lehre 11 (2013) , accessed November 18th, 2013. Since 2015, he is also director of the Maimonides Centre for Advanced Studies, a Centre founded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/267222884 He is also elected director of the Academy of World Religions AWR in Hamburg since 2017. One aim of the Academy is to promote interfaith dialogue between Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and Alevism.  Contributions to academia  In 1998, Veltri founded the now renowned Leopold Zunz Center at the Leucorea Foundation (Wittenberg) and has organised a large number of conferences, symposia and readings there. He took on the editorship of the Newsletter of the European Association for Jewish Studies (EAJS Newsletter), and has turned it into a respected, peer-reviewed periodical (European Journal of Jewish Studies), which is financed in part by the Rothschild Foundation and published by Brill.www.brill.nl/ejjs. It is recognized by Thomson Reuters Indices as an ISI journal. In 2001, Veltri founded a successful scientific-scholarly series with Brill, the Studies in Jewish Culture and History, which has published 54 volumes to date.www.brill.nl/sjhc. In the 1990s and beyond, Veltri draw his efforts to the establishment of the field of Jewish Studies as an academic discipline in former Eastern Germany. Due to this endeavour, Jewish studies in Germany became an acknowledged faculty with its own distinctive profile (Jewish philosophy, religion and Middle Eastern Studies). Since Veltri's appointment as professor at Halle University, the Seminary of Jewish studies has developed from a virtually one person enterprise into an efficient and recognized institution. From 2004 to 2012, Giuseppe Veltri was member of the scientific committee 106 of the German Research Foundation (DFG). From 2009 to 2019, he was chairman of the German Association for Jewish Studies.https://www.facebook.com/JewishStudiesGermany/?__tn__=kC-R&eid;=ARDPYUia5o-MjQKreZVREX6nuKoQjdX6qHvYeJu5n9xYfzcfaWH8xEnepiBuIpzrVraxTZgs9zJ4NlZB&hc;_ref=ARRdw3cM0xqCcrTdJMlG6nMWQ6g7wbZFNa8Edg5-dnnengQISLig8vzOSFq5DMOFc5M&fref;=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAWTYdCtGSqfFL1aIf5MvdQzijTNt00bfLHaGk3BAy9lrwH3_LuXg-7kVbX3DKsu_m_TES9Idb8FwRWcMPdVqLWJQUVXiZaD_Dt4modsP0tsElXX3t-s- MKVy8eTwoFwMqnKYNV4_4t5nCd77DT_fDfkeMJAX54iKcjy68YAJLSE1rdjJRy2VA37crday10QtcgF4saUY- GuTRdTnlqEnZNXL4KMlXT1i4C0XFpIHJixOkg11ZU8WChnA92sZnOS0KQKtx7lrnIb_Jyq9VGVfLPpGt1-O1EX8H9Wrh20aGUg5PDF8HVtPdKjBaxQhALXcY3N1-sdyFDX1i0B2ax9Cea5A In 2014 he was appointed professor of Jewish philosophy and religion at the University of Hamburg. He created the first Institute for Jewish Philosophy and Religion in Germany. His areas of research here are the Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages, of the last scholastic and Humanist Jewish philosopher Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno and of the Jewish scepticism. = Research = Giuseppe Veltri's research interests focus on the religion of ancient Judaism, medieval philosophy, the culture and philosophy of the Renaissance and Early Modern Period, and the Science of Judaism. He successfully realised several research projects dedicated to these fields. His doctoral dissertation on Jewish-Hellenistic and rabbinical conceptions of translation, as well as his habilitation thesis on magic, Jewish law and science have been recognized as ground-breaking in scope and depth for the study of the religion of ancient Judaism. The former was commended by the eminent Israeli scholar Emanuel Tov as a standard work on the topic, and the latter highly recognized by Hans- Dieter Betz, a distinguished expert on the history of magic. Veltri's research on the subject was and is further extended and deepened through the DFG project Midrash Tehillim that realized the edition of the rabbinic Midrash to Psalms, as well as the DFG project Sprachauffassungen,www.sprachauffassungen.de that investigates the relation between the Biblical conception of language and rabbinical and medieval grammatical terminology. In cooperation with scholars from Israel, France and the Netherlands, and through obtaining third party funding, Veltri could realize an important pilot project PESHAT (short for \\"Philosophic and Scientific Hebrew Terminology\\"), which is his key work in the area of Jewish philosophy. PESHAT is a long-term project that aims at the systematic study of the emergence and development of the philosophic and scientific terminology of premodern Hebrew in its cultural and historical context. An online multilingual thesaurus of medieval Hebrew philosophical and scientific terminology, already accessible via the project's homepage, is a 21st-century upgrade of and supplement to its printed predecessor, Jacob Klatzkin's Thesaurus philosophicus linguae hebraicae et veteris et recentioris, published in 5 volumes in Berlin in 1928‚Äì1933. Much of his scholary endeavour, Veltri devoted to the study of Renaissance philosophy and religious views. He translated and published the philosophical sermons of Judah MoscatoJudah Moscato's Sermons. Volume One, Volume Two, Volume Three, together with Gianfranco Miletto and Jehuda Halper (Leiden: Brill 2011‚Äì2013), and organized several conferences and symposia on the intellectual life of the Jews during the Early Modern period in Italy and elsewhere. A second project in this field is preparing the edition of the works of Simone Luzzatto.Scritti politici e filosofici di Simone Luzzatto, Rabbino e Filosofo nella Venezia del Seicento, in cooperation with Paola Ferruta & Anna Lissa (Milan: Bompiani 2013), The study of the Science of Judaism is associated with the name of Leopold Zunz, the founder of the \\"Wissenschaft des Judentums\\", who did his doctorate at the University of Halle and whose name is closely connected with the \\"Leopold Zunz Center for research on European Jewry\\" that Veltri founded at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. Veltri made the entire Jerusalem archive of Zunz available through cataloguing and digitalisation of more than 30,000 fols.www.jewish.archives.org A further research area is Jewish skepticism and Jewish skeptics. Since 2015, Giuseppe Veltri has been director of the Maimonides Center for Advanced Studies (MCAS). This research centre is based on the assumption that scepticism is an essential aspect of the processes and categorizations within Jewish philosophy, religion, literature, and society in its permanent exchange with adjacent cultures. He understands scepticism as the enquiry of the ‚Äòperpetual student‚Äô, who harbours doubts about different dimensions and systems of secular or revealed knowledge, calling authority as such into question. According to him, scepticism does not represent an intellectual or theoretical worldview, but rather an attitude that provides a basis for numerous and diverse phenomena. Hence, scepticism addresses fundamental processes and categorisations in Jewish philosophy, religion, literature, and society. More specifically, he applies the term scepticism to expressions of social deviance from, and conformity with, political structures, as well as to systems of governance, when they respond to and are in exchange with adjacent cultures.https://www.maimonides-centre.uni- hamburg.de/en/the-centre/research-profile.html From the skepticism research developed Giuseppe Veltri a concept of tolerance, whose research today takes a focus of his work. = Honours and offered positions = Giuseppe Veltri held guest professorships at the University College London, the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris), Sapienza University of Rome and the University of Bologna. In 2010, he was granted an honorary professorship for comparative religion at the University of Leipzig. In November 2010, the department of Jewish studies at the University of Halle-Wittenberg and Prof. Veltri as the head of department were granted the Emil Fackenheim Prize for Tolerance and Understanding awarded by the Jewish Community of Halle. The prize was for the first time awarded to an academic institute.news release of the University of Halle, November 16th, 2010, accessed February 26, 2013  Selected bibliography  *Discourse on the State of the Jews and in particular those dwelling in the illustrious city of Venice (1638), Simone Luzzatto, bilingual edition, edited, translated and commented together with Anna Lissa (Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2019), . *Socrates or on Human knowledge.

After completing a degree in law in 1958, Griffa became a practicing lawyer. In the sixties, Griffa began working as an assistant to the Italian painter Filippo Scroppo, a member of the MAC (Art Concreta) movement and a teacher at the Accademia Albertina in Turin.

Painting with acrylic on raw un-stretched canvas, burlap and linen, Griffa's works are nailed directly to the wall along their top edge. When not exhibited, the works are folded and stacked, resulting creases that create an underlying grid for his compositions.

Powered by a Pobjoy radial engine, three were built. Design Designed by Theo Slot, who was responsible for all of Pander & Sons original designs, the Multipro is variously described as a side-by-side two-seat or three-seat light aircraft. It had high and almost constant chord wings, braced on each side by a V-form pair of struts fixed to the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was a rounded, plywood-skinned structure, contemporaries remarking, as they had with other Panders, on the quality of the finish. It was powered by a Pobjoy R seven-cylinder radial engine; the two-blade propeller was driven via spur gears that reduced its speed and placed the output shaft above the engine centre, an unusual arrangement for a radial. The cabin was under the wing with a deep starboard-side access door and multi-panel glazing. The fuselage tapered aft, with the tailplane set halfway up it, and its fin and rudder together were almost triangular apart from a rounded tip. The Multipro's conventional undercarriage was fixed, with the mainwheels on V-struts attached to the lower longerons and stabilized laterally by an inverted V-strut jointed at the fuselage central underside. The Multipro flew for the first time in September 1932. Operational history In all, three Multipros were built. The first and third were rapidly sold to private individuals; the second remained registered to the Pander works until 1937, when it too was bought privately. All remained on the Dutch civil aircraft register until at least 1939. One, the second aircraft, is known to have been destroyed by German bombing during the invasion of the Netherlands on 10 May 1940.

Life  She was born in Bergen as a daughter of teacher and military officer Wessel Joachim Reehorst Joys (1841‚Äì1922) and Lina Storjohann (1841‚Äì1925). On the maternal side she was a niece of Nanna and Johan C. H. Storjohann, and a first cousin of Marie Michelet. After primary school, Joys travelled to Berlin in 1892 to undergo nursing education at the institution Victoriahaus. While studying she was a subordinate nurse at Friedrichshain Hospital, and after graduating in 1895 she was hired as a chief nurse there, only 23 years of age. In 1897 she was persuaded to return to Bergen, where she was offered the job as chief nurse at the Bergen Municipal Hospital surgical department. She stayed here until her retirement in 1933. She was credited (together with Camilla Struve and Betty Bull) with planning and establishing the first three-year nursing education in Norway. This started at Bergen Municipal Hospital in 1908. At this course they also pioneered the pre-training school, a theoretical course that aspiring nurses had to attend before entering the practical training. This idea was soon adapted by other nursing educators as well as the Norwegian Nurses' Union. Joys was a co-founder of the Norwegian Nurses' Union in 1912. During the First Balkan War, during the winter of 1912‚Äì1913, Joys volunteered at an Ottoman military hospital in Constantinople. She thus became known as one of the first nurses to volunteer in a catastrophic setting abroad‚Äîalready from her study days she had been an admirer of Florence Nightingale. In 1948 she issued her memoirs, Erindringer, where she described the war among other things. Arntzen was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1923 and the international Florence Nightingale Medal from the Red Cross in 1937. She did not marry. She died in November 1944 in Bergen.

It lies in the middle of the range, and according to most sources, it is 1310 meters high. The peak itself is surrounded by dense pine forest, which makes it impossible view the surrounding area. In the past, however, no trees were present there, and according to the 1832 sources, it was possible to see the city of Krak√≥w with a telescope. On the top there is a stone obelisk with an iron cross. Turbacz belongs to the Crown of Polish Mountains. Turbacz is popular among tourists, with a junction of several trails located in front of a local PTTK shelter. The shelter itself, located at the height of 1283 meters, provides views of the Tatras and the Pieniny mountains. Turbacz shelter is a large stone building, with two wings. It was opened in 1958, and has 100 beds. Next to the shelter there is a PTTK Museum of Mountain Culture and Tourism, opened in 1980. Every second Sunday of August a Celebration of Mountains takes place next to the so-called Papal Chapel, on the Wisielakowka clearing. It attracts a number of tourists, and in the same spot, a traditional service was led by Reverend J√≥zef Tischner. On August 12, 2012, a monument dedicated to Polish soldiers was opened on the Wisielak√≥wka clearing. Every summer, a mountain bike race takes place from Rabka Zdr√≥j to Turbacz and back. During World War II and in the second half of the 1940s, numerous anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet partisan units operated in the area of Turbacz. One personality closely associated with the peak is J√≥zef Kura≈õ, nom de guerre Ogie≈Ñ, a controversial Polish cursed soldier, who fought both Nazi and Soviet occupiers. In the past, the mountain was known by local people as Kluczki. In 1790, Habsburg cartographers, working on the map of Galicia, made a mistake, placing the village of Niedzwiedz in the location of the peak, which resulted in naming confusion throughout the 19th century. The word Turbacz itself probably is of Wallachian origin, coming from the Romanian word turbƒÉ, which means \\"peat\\". The summit of Turbacz has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc) due to its elevation. The average temperatures are comparable with those found in places in far Northern Europe, such as Alta, Norway, however, the high annual precipitation in combination with the low temperatures places it firmly within the Subalpine Rainforest zone according to Holdridge.

It was directed and co-written by Harold Cronk and stars David A.R. White, Anna Zielinski, Randy Travis, Lee Majors, Stacy Keach, and Marco Khan.  Plot  In this end of times thriller, seven backpack nukes, code named The Seven Wonders have been dispatched throughout the United States by terrorists. A battle for Jerusalem has begun, and Israel's main ally, America, is targeted for destruction. Senior FBI Agent Shane Daughtry (David A. R. White) and agent Eve Rearden (Anna Zielinski) must find these weapons before they can be detonated. Time is of the essence; useful information is coming from Arlin Rockwell (Lee Majors), a dysfunctional arms dealer who smuggled the weapons, Jackson (Stacy Keach), a retired FBI agent, and Jack Thompson (Randy Travis), a rigid CIA Deputy Director, against a Russian-Iranian terrorist group known as The Revolution of God who put the nuclear attack plan into motion. The anti -Israeli group is under the command of Matthew Dean and a private transporter named Javad (Marco Khan).  Cast  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was written by Jeehun Hwang.  Reception  Several reviewers complained about character development that leads nowhere and excessive attention lavished on newscasts pertaining to negotiations in Israel, the importance of these issues characters might be revisited in a sequel. Victor Medina's review for Cinelix mentions an additional nine cut scenes from the Blu-ray, that would have provided more character development, but would have also slowed down the action. For this type of film, Jerusalem Countdown includes better than average performances, a fair degree of filmmaking craft, but some rote and clich√© ridden writing.

History of the UDF=Establishment= After the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, General Jan Smuts, the Union's first Minister of Defence, placed a high priority on creating a unified military out of the separate armies of the union's four provinces. The South African Defence Act (Act 13 of 1912) made provision for a UDF that would be composed of a Permanent Force (or standing army) of career soldiers, an Active Citizen Force (ACF) of temporary conscripts, a Coast Garrison Force and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (South African Division) (RNVR(SA)), as well as any other defence arm that might in future be established to meet the defence requirements of the Union of South Africa. The 1912 law also obligated all white males between seventeen and sixty years of age to serve in the military, but this was not strictly enforced as there were a large number of volunteers. Instead, half of the white males aged from 17 to 25 were drafted by lots into the ACF. =Permanent Force= Initially, the Permanent Force consisted of five regular mounted regiments and a small artillery section as well as a headquarters, instructional and administrative staff. Provision was also made for a Coastal Defence Corps, South African Aviation Corps (SAAC) ‚Äì part of the ACF and School Cadet Corps. No provision was made for an overall commander, instead the commanders of the Citizen Force, Cadet Corps and Permanent Force reported directly to the Minister of Defence. =Headquarters= On 1 July 1912 the Headquarters of the UDF was established in Pretoria. Headquarters comprised three sections: Secretariat, General Staff and an Administrative section. A Medical Services Section was added in December 1913, and during 1916 the Administrative Section became the Quartermaster-General's Section. Brigadier General Christian Frederick Beyers was appointed Commandant General of the Citizen Force, Brigadier General Henry Lukin became Inspector General of the Permanent Force and Colonel Percival Scott Beves became Commandant of Cadets. They reported directly to the Minister of Defence. C.F. Beyers resigned his post in September 1914 and the role was taken over by the Minister of Defence The titles of the officers in charge of these sections were changed on 1 July 1915. The Head of the General Staff became Chief Staff Officer, General Staff and Adjudant-General. The Head of the Administrative section became Quartermaster General. In July 1917 the General Staff post was again renamed to Chief of the General Staff and Adjudant-General. In May 1918 the co- ordination of all military staff work at HQ and the issue of all military orders was vested in the Chief of the General Staff, as well as the responsibilities of Commandant of Cadets and the role of Adjudant General was split off. There were 4 sections under the CGS ‚Äì General Staff section, Adjudant General, Medical Services and Quartermaster General. Andries Brink was appointed Chief of the General Staff in 1920. The posts of Chief of the General Staff and Secretary of Defence were combined on 30 September 1922, following the retirement of Sir Roland Bourne =Creation of the Services= The South African Army was created first by merging the existing military structures of the former British colonies and Boer Republics that had become the four provinces of the Union. The formation of the South African Air Force followed in 1920. The South African Naval Service was created in 1922, following the donation of HMS Thames which became the South African Training Ship General Botha. =1922 re-organisation= The SA Defence Act Amendment Act, No. 22 of 1922 re-organised the Permanent Force. From 1 February 1923 the Permanent Force consisted of the Staff Corps, Instructional Corps, Naval Service, Field Artillery, 1st Regiment, Mounted Riflemen, the Permanent Garrison Artillery, the Engineer Corps, the Air Force, SA Service Corps, SA Medical Corps, Ordnance Corps, Veterinary Corps and the Administrative, Pay and Clerical Corps. =1926 to 1934= To save money another reorganisation took place in 1926. The last regiment of the SA Mounted Riflemen was disbanded as was the Brigade HQ of the SA Field Artillery. The Great Depression put pressure on the Budget and 56 Citizen Force units were disbanded and the number of military districts was reduced from 16 to 6 The Special Service Battalion was started as a way of creating work for young people who could not find employment. A drastic move was the disbanding of the Naval Service In 1933 Oswald Pirow became Minister of Defence, General Brink was appointed GOC of the UDF as well as the Secretary of Defence and Pierre van Ryneveld became Chief of the General Staff. In addition the 6 military districts were redesignated \\"Commands\\". =Pirow's 5yr expansion plan= As the economy improved Minister Pirow put forward a plan to expand and reorganise the Defence Force. The Air Force would be increased to 7 squadrons, with new bases being built at Waterkloof, Bloemfontein, Durban and Youngsfield. However, by the start of World War II this had not materialised. The Active Citizen Force units would increase from 8 to 24, 12 based in urban areas and 12 based in the countryside Wars and other actions In 1913 and 1914, the new 23,400-member Citizen Force was called on to suppress several industrial strikes on the Witwatersrand. The UDF participated in the First World War, The Second World War, the Berlin Airlift and the Korean War. World War I=Military action against Germany= The Union Defence Force saw action in a number areas in the First World War. In Africa the Army invaded German South-West Africa, later known as South West Africa, and now known as Namibia. The South Africans expelled German forces and gained control of the German colony. As part of the Allies' East African Campaign an expedition under General Jan Smuts was dispatched to German East Africa (later known as Tanganyika). The objective was to fight German forces in that colony and to try to capture the elusive German General von Lettow-Vorbeck. Ultimately, Lettow-Vorbeck fought his tiny force out of German East Africa into Mozambique and then Northern Rhodesia, where he accepted a cease-fire three days after the end of the war. In Europe the 1st South African Infantry Brigade were shipped to France to fight on the Western Front. In addition to 5 batteries of Heavy Artillery, a Field Ambulance, a Royal Engineers Signal Company and a General Hospital were raised and sent to the front. The Battle of Delville Wood in 1916 was the most costly battle fought by the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force. South Africans also saw action in the Middle East, with the Cape Corps deploying as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. =Military contributions and casualties= More than 146,000 whites, 83,000 blacks and 2,500 people of Coloured and Asian descent served in South African military units during the war, including 43,000 in German South-West Africa and 30,000 on the Western Front. An estimated 3,000 South Africans also joined the Royal Flying Corps. The total South African casualties during the war was about 18,600 with over 12,452 killed ‚Äì more than 4,600 in the European theater alone. World War II Union Defence Force infantry on parade, c. 1939. South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theaters of war. South Africa's contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, airmen and material for the North African campaign (the Desert War) and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa. Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force. #The South African Army and Air Force played a major role in defeating the Italian forces of Benito Mussolini during the 1940/1941 East African Campaign. The converted Junkers Ju 86s of 12 Squadron, South African Air Force, carried out the first bombing raid of the campaign on a concentration of tanks at Moyale at 8am on 11 June 1940, mere hours after Italy's declaration of war. #Another important victory that the South Africans participated in was the liberation of Malagasy (now known as Madagascar) from the control of the Vichy French who were allies of the Nazis. British troops aided by South African soldiers, staged their attack from South Africa, landing on the strategic island on 4 May 1942 to preclude its seizure by the Japanese. #The South African 1st Infantry Division took part in several actions in North Africa in 1941 and 1942, including the Battle of El Alamein, before being withdrawn to South Africa to be re- constituted as an armoured division. #The South African 2nd Infantry Division also took part in a number of actions in North Africa during 1942, but on 21 June 1942 two complete infantry brigades of the division as well as most of the supporting units were captured at the fall of Tobruk. #The South African 3rd Infantry Division never took an active part in any battles but instead organised and trained the South African home defence forces, performed garrison duties and supplied replacements for the South African 1st Infantry Division and the South African 2nd Infantry Division. However, one of this division's constituent brigades ‚Äì 7 SA Motorised Brigade ‚Äì did take part in the invasion of Madagascar in 1942. #The South African 6th Armoured Division fought in numerous actions in Italy in 1944-1945. #The South African Air Force made a significant contribution to the air war in East Africa, North Africa, Sicily, Italy, the Balkans and even as far east as bombing missions aimed at the Romanian oilfields in Ploie»ôti, supply missions in support of the Warsaw uprising and reconnaissance missions ahead of the Soviet advances in the Lvov- Cracow area. #Numerous South African airmen also volunteered service to the RAF, some serving with distinction. #South Africa contributed to the war effort against Japan, supplying men and manning ships in naval engagements against the Japanese. Of the 334,000 men volunteered for full-time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 coloureds and Indians), nearly 9,000 were killed in action. Korean War The names of those who died and are listed as missing can be found on the Memorial plaque in the gardens of the Union Buildings in Pretoria. In the 1950s, 2 Squadron (\\"The Flying Cheetahs\\") of the SAAF served as South Africa's primary contribution to the United Nations Command. Over 200 officers and some 545 airmen in the South African Air Force saw action over Korea between 1950 and 1953. Also represented were 38 different ranks from other branches of the UDF. South Africa suffered 34 dead or missing in action during the Korean War. Eight pilots either shot down by communist forces or forced to land their aircraft behind enemy lines were taken prisoner.

The Victory Corps was an American program during the Second World War that provided military training to male and female high school students. On September 25, 1942, Commissioner of Education John W. Studebaker, in conjunction with United States Departments of War, Navy, and Civil Aeronautics, established the Victory Corps. The program was designed to prepare secondary school students for possible military service and participation in the war effort. Although participation in the program was voluntary, many high schools across the country sought to aid the war effort due to rising patriotic fervor following Pearl Harbor. For example, a survey conducted by the American Legion in 1943 found that of 232 high schools in Oregon, 86 schools had established a Victory Corps program and 96 schools planned on implementing the program in the following semester. The United States Office of Education aimed that every high school in the country would implement the Victory Corps program. At the start of the 1942‚Äì43 school year, the United States Office of Education proposed that the Victory Corps purpose was to fulfill two major objectives: 1. The training of youth for the war service that will come after they leave school; 2. Active participation of youth in the community's war effort while they are yet in school. Two categories of membership were offered. A general membership, one for students who were involved in school war effort activities; and a divisional membership open to students in grades eleven and twelve who had completed two years of general membership. The program focused on skills relevant to the war effort, ranging from physical conditioning to more specialized skills depending on the desired branch of the armed forces, such as trigonometry for the U.S. Navy. Broadly, the Corps emphasized \\"science, mathematics, and physical education\\". Specifically, the program consisted of eight areas of training to prepare students for war service and war effort participation: * Guidance into Critical Services and Occupations * Wartime Citizenship * Physical Fitness * Basic Training in Mathematics and Science * Pre-flight Aeronautics * Production Training for Critical Occupations * Community Service * Military Drill From these areas, students would choose an occupational path based on their strengths and interests. These paths, or divisions, included the following: air service (for aviation cadets or aircraft repair), sea service (for the Navy or Merchant Marine), land service (for the Army or Marine Corps), production service (for trades and war industries), and community service (for professional positions such as engineering and nursing). Along with the program's curriculum being taught in the classroom, school clubs were also created and modified for war work. For example, at Whittier High School in Whittier, California, the Home Economics Club made garments for the Red Cross while the World Friend's Club held panels on post-war problems. The ambition of the Victory Corps Program was not always matched with application. The program was only implemented into 52% of schools, and these schools complained of being understaffed, and unsure of how to implement the Victory Corps into their existing curriculum. Criticism of the program came from Quakers and Brethren churches as they feared that the introduction of the Victory Corps was a step towards militarism in American schools. Parallels were drawn between the militarization of German and Japanese schooling and youth movements. As the war drew to a close in Europe and Asia, the Corps was gradually phased out starting in June 1944. However, the Victory Corps Program made a significant impact in the United States war effort during WWII. During its two years of existence, the program distributed a substantial amount of knowledge to schools across the country and raised millions of dollars for the war effort. Along with its practical achievements, the Victory Corps program was also groundbreaking for its time because it allowed participation from both white and African-American students, ten years before public schools were desegregated.

The Commission assessed that NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was \\"illegal but justified\\", in order to prevent further atrocities by Yugoslav forces, which intensified during the NATO bombing. The crisis had been caused by ongoing human-rights violations by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo during the 1990s, although when some Kosovar Albanians shifted from unarmed to armed resistance, this exacerbated the Yugoslav response which included many crimes against humanity. The Commission also reported that international presence established in Kosovo did not prevent Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and other Albanians to ethnically cleanse Kosovo ethnic minorities. The decision of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) not to open an investigation against NATO was widely criticized.  Members  Seven out of eleven members of the commission were from countries which are members of NATO. Richard Goldstone and Carl Tham were appointed as first co-chairmen and other members were chosen for one-year terms. The first eleven members included Anan Ashrawi, Richard A. Falk, Martha Minow, Mary Kaldor, Michael Ignatieff, Grace d'Almeida, Theo Sommer, Jacques Rupnik, Jan Urban, Akiko Domoto, and Oleg Grinevsky. One of the members, Richard A. Falk, later coauthored a work on distinction between legality and legitimacy published in 2012.  Purpose  One of its purposes of the commission was to assess \\"the adequacy of present norms and institutions in preventing and responding\\" to ethnic conflict as seen in Kosovo.  Commission's reports  The Commission found that: The assessment of the Commission regarding the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was that it was \\"illegal but justified;\\" it had not been authorized by the UN Security Council, but the intervention was beneficial for the Albanian population at direct risk from the government crackdowns. The commission's finding that the NATO action was illegal may result in determining a responsibility of individuals or state. The decision of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) not to open an investigation against NATO regarding individual responsibility was heavily criticized, as well as the humanitarian interventionism. The commission criticized NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for failing to protect minorities in Kosovo and allowing \\"reverse ethnic cleansing\\". The commission stated that KFOR was reluctant to and did not have the capability to prevent violence against ethnic minorities and that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and other Albanians ethnically cleansed Kosovo after the international presence was established in Kosovo.

The reductions in spending authority were approximately $85.4 billion (versus $42 billion in actual cash outlays) during fiscal year 2013, with similar cuts for years 2014 until 2021. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total federal outlays would continue to increase even with the sequester by an average of $238.6 billion per year during the following decade, although at a somewhat lesser rate. The cuts were split evenly (by dollar amounts, not by percentages) between the defense and non- defense categories. Some major programs like Social Security, Medicaid, federal pensions and veteran's benefits are exempt. By a special provision in the BCA, Medicare spending rates were limited to no more than 2% per year versus the other, domestic percents planned for the sequester. Federal pay rates (including military) were unaffected but the sequestration did result in involuntary unpaid time off, also known as furloughs. The sequester lowers spending by a total of approximately $1.1 trillion versus pre-sequester levels over the approximately 8-year period from 2013 to 2021. It lowers non-defense discretionary spending (i.e., certain domestic programs) by a range of 7.8% (in 2013) to 5.5% (in 2021) versus pre-sequester amounts, a total of $294 billion. Defense spending would likewise be lowered by 10% (in 2013) to 8.5% (in 2021), a total of $454 billion. Savings in non-defense mandatory spending would total $170 billion, while interest would be lowered by $169 billion. The CBO estimated that in the absence of sequestration, the GDP would grow about 0.6 percentage points faster for 2013 (from 2.0% to 2.6% or about $90B) and about 750,000 more jobs would be created by year-end. As of May 2013, FY2013 spending ($3.455 trillion) was projected to be lower in an absolute sense than FY2012 spending ($3.537 trillion). The blunt nature of the cuts has been criticized, with some favoring more tailored cuts and others arguing for postponement while the economy improves.NYT-Paul Krugman-Sequester of Fools- February 2013  Legislative history  On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 as part of an agreement with Congress to resolve the debt-ceiling crisis. The Act provided for a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the \\"super committee\\") to produce legislation by late November that would decrease the deficit by $1.2 trillion over ten years. When the super committee failed to act, another part of the BCA went into effect. This directed automatic across-the-board cuts (known as \\"sequestrations\\") to be split evenly between defense and domestic spending, beginning on January 2, 2013. The sequestration became a major topic of the fiscal cliff debate. The debate's resolution, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), eliminated much of the tax side of the dispute but only delayed the budget sequestrations for two months, thus reducing the original $110 billion to be saved per fiscal year to $85 billion in 2013. Proposals and counterproposals =Before the sequester took effect= The following significant proposals for stopping or mitigating the automatic cuts were floated before the sequestration was implemented on March 1, 2013: By the President While supporting various Democratic measures but without getting into specifics, President Obama has said that he would still like to see a broad range of spending cuts and tax changes. Failing that, Congress should at least pass a smaller package that would delay the sequester for a few more months. The White House did rule out any attempts to raise the eligibility age for Medicare. By Republicans in Congress The Republican House had narrowly passed a bill on December 20, 2012, which would have replaced only the defense side of the sequester with cuts to programs including food stamps, Dodd-Frank and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In February with their reduced majority, key Republicans admitted that they would not be able to pass the bill again, even in the House. Nevertheless, many Republicans believed that the bill would serve as a template for what they wanted: no tax increases, no defense cuts, and considerable domestic spending reductions. By Democrats in Congress On February 8, Democrat Chris Van Hollen, ranking member of the House Budget Committee, introduced new taxes and reduced spending to fend off the sequestration, including a Buffett-style tax-rule on millionaires, a repeal of some oil subsidy loopholes, a reduction in farm subsidy payments and an increase in flood insurance premiums. Patty Murray, Democratic Chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, proposed on February 14 to replace the 2013 sequester with $110 billion in spending cuts and tax increases. Like the House version, these policies also include a Buffett-rule tax, the closure of the oil subsidies, and cuts to farm subsidies. Additionally, this bill would cut defense spending for 2013 in excess of the amounts required by the current sequester. But this bill has little chance of winning the 60 votes required to override a filibuster. Both of these plans are temporary in the sense that they allow much of the sequestration to resume at the end of 2013. By others Some public interest groups concerned about the federal budget wanted to stop the sequester, but few offered detail plans (beyond a \\"balanced approach\\") for replacing the automatic cuts. These few included: * FreedomWorks and the Conservative Action Project said that the sequester should be replaced by defunding Obamacare; that is, eliminating: the refundable tax credits that form the basis of the federal health exchanges, the Medicare expansion matching funds and the increased funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) and Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). =During the sequester= While leaving the sequestration in place, the House approved a bipartisan bill on March 6 by a vote of 267 to 151 to extend the continuing resolution from March 27 to September 30 and to keep the federal government from shutting down. The bill also provides Defense and Veterans Affairs some flexibility to fine-tune the sequester cuts. CBO projections=Overview= The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in September 2011 that the sequester would have the following effects between 2013 and 2021: *\\"Reductions ranging from 10.0 percent (in 2013) to 8.5 percent (in 2021) in the caps on new discretionary appropriations for defense programs, yielding total outlay savings of $454 billion.\\" *\\"Reductions ranging from 7.8 percent (in 2013) to 5.5 percent (in 2021) in the caps on new discretionary appropriations for nondefense programs, resulting in outlay savings of $294 billion.\\" *\\"Reductions ranging from 10.0 percent (in 2013) to 8.5 percent (in 2021) in mandatory budgetary resources for nonexempt defense programs, generating savings of about $0.1 billion.\\" *\\"Reductions of 2.0 percent each year in most Medicare spending because of the application of a special rule that applies to that program, producing savings of $123 billion, and reductions ranging from 7.8 percent (in 2013) to 5.5 percent (in 2021) in mandatory budgetary resources for other nonexempt nondefense programs and activities, yielding savings of $47 billion. Thus, savings in nondefense mandatory spending would total $170 billion.\\" *\\"About $31 billion in outlays stemming from the reductions in premiums for Part B of Medicare and other changes in spending that would result from the sequestration actions.\\" *\\"An estimated reduction of $169 billion in debt-service costs.\\" *\\"In all, those automatic cuts would produce net budgetary savings of about $1.1 trillion over the 2013‚Äì2021 period.\\" =Discretionary spending= Discretionary spending for the 2012-2020 periods, as projected in the CBO's Budget and Economic Outlook publications from January 2010 and February 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (which includes the sequester) is the primary difference. Discretionary spending includes both defense and non-defense spending elements, but excludes mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The Budget Control Act of 2011 included both caps on discretionary spending as well as the sequester, both of which reduce discretionary spending. CBO projected in February 2013 that under the sequester and Budget Control Act caps: *Discretionary spending outlays will be reduced from $1,285.3 billion in 2012 to $1,213.9 billion in 2013, a reduction of $71.4 billion or 5.6%. Discretionary spending will fall again to $1,170.0 billion in 2014, a decrease of $42.8 billion or 3.6%. *Discretionary spending will rise gradually from $1,170.0 in 2014 to $1,423.8 billion by 2023, an annual growth rate of 2.2% during the 2014 to 2023 period and 0.9% for the 2012-2023 period. The 2.2% growth rate approximates CBO's projected rate of inflation and is well below the annual spending growth rate of 6.3% from 2000 to 2012. *Discretionary spending will fall steadily from 8.3% GDP in 2012 to 5.5% GDP by 2023. Discretionary spending averaged 7.7% GDP from 1990 to 2012, ranging from 6.2% GDP to 9.0% GDP. Defense spending CBO projected in February 2013 that under the sequester and Budget Control Act caps: *Defense spending outlays (including \\"overseas contingency operations\\" for Iraq and Afghanistan) will be reduced from $670.3 billion in 2012 to approximately $627.6 billion in 2013, a decrease of $42.7 billion or 6.4%. Defense spending will fall again to $593.4 billion in 2014, a decrease of $34.2 billion or 5.5%. *Defense spending will rise gradually from $593 billion in 2014 to $714 billion by 2023, an annual growth rate of 2.1% during the 2014 to 2023 period and 0.6% for the 2012-2023 period. The 2.1% growth rate approximates CBO's projected rate of inflation and is well below the annual spending growth rate of 7.1% from 2000‚Äì2012. *Defense spending will fall steadily from 4.3% GDP in 2012 to 2.8% GDP by 2023. Defense spending averaged 4.0% GDP from 1990 to 2012, ranging from 3.0% GDP to 5.2% GDP. In spite of these reductions, the major defense contractors saw good profits during the sequester. Non-defense discretionary spending Non-defense discretionary spending includes Cabinet Departments and Agencies. CBO projected in February 2013 that under the sequester and Budget Control Act caps: *Non-defense discretionary spending outlays will be reduced from $615.0 billion in 2012 to approximately $586.3 billion in 2013, a reduction of $28.7 billion or 4.7%. This spending will fall again to $576.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of $9.7 billion or 1.6%. *Non-defense discretionary spending will rise gradually from $576.6 billion in 2014 to $709.8 billion by 2023, an annual growth rate of 2.3% during the 2014 to 2023 period and 1.3% for the 2012-2023 period. The 2.3% growth rate approximates CBO's projected rate of inflation and is well below the annual spending growth rate of 5.6% from 2000‚Äì2012. *Non-defense discretionary spending will fall steadily from 4.0% GDP in 2012 to 2.7% GDP by 2023. This spending averaged 3.8% GDP from 1990 to 2012, ranging from 3.2% GDP to 4.6% GDP. =Mandatory spending= Mandatory spending represents outlays to qualified program participants. It does not have to be renewed annually. Major categories of mandatory spending include Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The latter two programs are not in the scope of the sequester. An estimated $170 billion over the 2013-2022 period would be saved relative to the pre-sequester path. Medicare CBO estimated in September 2011 that \\"most\\" Medicare spending would be reduced by approximately 2% per year versus planned levels, for total savings of $123 billion over the 2013-2022 period. CBO projects that Medicare spending will rise from $551 billion in 2012 to over $1 trillion in 2023, despite the sequester. This is an annual growth rate of 6.3%. Starting April 1, 2013 the sequester cut 2% of the Medicare budget, primarily targeting oncologist reimbursements.Sequester Has Real Effects For Medicare Medicare Benefits: Hank Pomeranz Retrieved April 10, 2013. Since oncologists cannot change the drug prices, they argue that the entire 2 percent cut will have to come out of the 6 percent overhead they use to cover the cost of storing and administering the medication.Cancer clinics are turning away thousands of Medicare patients The Washington Post: Sarah Kliff Retrieved April 3, 2013. Other mandatory spending Other mandatory spending totaling $47 billion would also be reduced during the 2013-2022 period. This includes cuts to aid for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (welfare) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) are however exempt from sequestration. =Interest savings= CBO estimated in September 2011 that interest would be reduced by approximately $170 billion over a decade if the sequester is implemented, due to relatively lower national debt levels compared to the previously planned path. =Timing of outlay reduction= CBO explained why it expects the sequestration to reduce outlays by $42 billion in fiscal year 2013, although the automatic budget cuts total $85 billion: \\"The $85 billion represents the reduction in budgetary resources available to government agencies this year as a result of the sequestration. But not all of that money would have been spent in this fiscal year in the absence of the sequestration: Some would have been used to enter into contracts to buy goods or services to be provided and paid for next year or in subsequent years. Acquiring major weapons systems and completing large construction projects, for example, can take several years. The $42 billion figure is CBO‚Äôs estimate of the reduction in cash disbursements in fiscal year 2013; much of the remaining outlay reductions from the 2013 sequestration will occur in fiscal year 2014, though some will occur later.\\" Sequester in 2014 and beyond The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in April 2012 that the process for 2014 and beyond is different from 2013:Center on Budget and Policy Priorities-How the Across-the-Board Cuts in the Budget Control Act Will Work- April 27, 2012 *If Congress passes appropriations legislation that are below the Budget Control Act caps, then \\"unlike in 2013, there will be no automatic cut of all affected defense programs by the same percentage.\\" The same will be true for the non-defense discretionary cuts. *\\"For non-defense programs, the process in years after 2013 is the same as in 2013 for entitlements but different for non-defense discretionary programs.\\" *\\"Medicare payments to providers and health insurance plans will continue to be cut by 2 percent; in other words, for the entire nine-year period 2013-2021, providers and plans will be paid 98 cents on the dollar. But because Medicare costs are projected to rise from 2013 through 2021, the dollar amount saved by this 2 percent cut will increase, from $11.0 billion in 2013 to $11.4 billion in 2014 and ultimately to $17.8 billion in 2021.\\" *\\"Because Medicare will take a growing share of the $54.7 billion annual non-defense cut (it will account for 21 percent of that amount in 2014 but 33 percent in 2021), other non-defense programs will absorb a declining share of the cut.\\" The sequestration levels will not be enforced until January of each fiscal year, because historically Congress would pass appropriations bills later than the beginning of the fiscal year, and the final appropriated amounts would not be known until after Congress had adjourned at the end of the calendar year. Mitch McConnell has said that he will attempt to lock in the sequestration in any future budget deal. CNO Jonathan Greenert testified that this would result in immediate cutbacks in naval construction and final combat fleet of 255 ships, and others testified that sequestration risks injuring several programs such as fighter engines, rotorcraft, missiles and railguns. In December 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 changed the sequestration caps for FY2014 and FY2015. This deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. Federal spending would thus be larger in these two years, but would be less in subsequent years until 2023, due to other provisions such as imposing sequester cuts in 2022 and 2023, raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers. Paul Ryan said that the bill would lower the deficit by $23 billion overall. The increased spending for 2014 and 2015 was spread evenly between defense spending and non-defense discretionary spending, leaving the cuts to mandatory spending unchanged. The bill did not make any changes to entitlement programs. Economic effects Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, predicted that the sequestration would contribute significant economic headwinds that would slow the recovery of the U.S. labor market. In February 2012 the CBO reported, \\"In the absence of sequestration, CBO estimates, GDP growth would be about 0.6 percentage points faster during [the 2013] calendar year, and the equivalent of about 750,000 more full-time jobs would be created or retained by the fourth quarter.\\" Economist Paul Krugman reported one estimate that implementation of the sequester could cost 700,000 jobs.Macroadvisers-MA's Alternative Scenario: March 1 Sequestration-February 2013 The International Monetary Fund plans to lower its 2013 GDP growth forecast for the U.S. from 2.0% to 1.5% if the sequester is implemented.Bloomberg-IMF Says It Will Lower U.S. Outlook Because of Sequestration-February 28, 2013 Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke testified in February 2013 that the Federal government should replace the sequester with smaller cuts today and larger cuts in the future, due to concerns the sequester would slow the economy.NYT-Binyamin Appelbaum-Austerity Kills Government Jobs as Cuts to Budgets Loom-February 26, 2013 He reminded lawmakers of the CBO's guidance that recent austerity measures were projected to reduce economic growth by up to 1.5 percentage points in 2013 (relative to what it would have been otherwise), of which 0.6 percentage points related to the sequester. Bernanke stated that the long-run fiscal issues mainly related to an aging population and healthcare costs. He wrote: \\"To address both the near- and longer-term [fiscal] issues, the Congress and the Administration should consider replacing the sharp, front-loaded spending cuts required by the sequestration with policies that reduce the federal deficit more gradually in the near term but more substantially in the longer run. Such an approach could lessen the near-term fiscal headwinds facing the recovery while more effectively addressing the longer-term imbalances in the federal budget.\\" Bernanke also explained that although current laws would stabilize the debt- to-GDP ratio at around 75%, the ratio averaged less than 40% from 1960 to the onset of the crisis in 2008: \\"This relatively low level of debt provided the nation much-needed flexibility to meet the economic challenges of the past few years. Replenishing this fiscal capacity will give future Congresses and Administrations greater scope to deal with unforeseen events.\\" A few months later, the Federal Open Markets Committee reviewed the latest economic data and concluded that the sequestration was \\"restraining economic growth\\" and slowing the recovery in the jobs market. A May 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office quantified the effects of the sequestration on federal employees and concluded that the Justice Department laid off one staff member as a result. Impact on research funding Under sequestration, agencies that fund research and development would see their budgets cut 5.1 to 7.3 percent in 2013 and remain stagnant through 2021. In the next three years, this reduction in R&D; is projected to decrease the number of jobs by 600,000. The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation estimates sequestration will reduce GDP by $200 billion compared to a scenario where R&D; funding were fixed at 2011 amounts and by $565 billion compared to a scenario where R&D; funding grows in proportion to output. The current Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Francis S. Collins, said: \\"I worry desperately this means we will lose a generation of young scientists.\\" Grant applications are already funded at half their historic rate, and with the sequester the chances of approval are expected to decrease even further. Former NIH head Dr. Elias Zerhouni argued that the sequester would have a substantial impact on the future of scientific research. Since the NIH will have to continue to fund existing research, the sequester will fall heavily on new research proposals. The current generation of rising scientists will find it particularly hard to fund their research projects. Other effects In September 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report entitled \\"Voices from the Field\\" citing the impacts of sequestration to include \\"New intelligence investigations were not being opened. Criminal cases were being closed. Informants couldn‚Äôt be paid. And there was not enough funding for agents to put gas in their cars.\\" For the 2013‚Äì2014 academic year, the Early Head Start and Head Start Programs eliminated services for 57,000 children to balance budgets diminished by the federal sequester.

Plot summary Set during the 1970s, Trauma focuses on the life of Dr Charlie Weir, who lives and works in New York City as a psychiatrist specializing in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Charlie's narration begins with a reminiscence of his early life and his mother's developing struggle with depressive illness, before moving into other traumatic instances of his relationship with his mother before the revelation of her death. Charlie rekindles a relationship with his ex-wife Agnes of the day of his mother's funeral, triggering Charlie to relive the reasons for their separation, namely the suicide of Agnes brother Danny. Eight years prior to this, Charlie worked as a psychotherapist helping veterans of the Vietnam War to overcome their post-traumatic stress. Included amongst his patients was Danny, who was well-respected by the other veterans, though rarely spoke. Charlie, in an attempt to draw him out of his malaise, followed Danny to a bar and attempted to engage him about his experiences, an act that Charlie would later believe to be the direct cause for man's suicide, as soon after he killed himself with a gun in his shower. At the same time as Charlie is recounting these memories, he has also begun a new relationship with Nora Chiara, which quickly turns sour. Nora begins to have violent nightmares that Charlie attributes to some psychological disorder, though she refuses to seek treatment. The strain this places on their relationship, in combination with Charlie's own negative relationship with his family and his continuing return to painful memories associated with Danny, forces Charlie to confront his own repressed traumas. He retreats to an old family holiday destination in the Catskills, triggering the repressed memory of his mother's violent rape at gun point, and ending in a confrontation with his brother and father in which Charlie shoots his brother. The novel ends as Charlie waits for psychiatric aid to arrive, and, as he believes, to be taken 'home' to a state hospital for the insane.  Themes = Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder = A central theme of the text is the effects of post-traumatic stress and the ways in which the mind deals with significant psychological trauma.

Originally, a commercial hotel to Waterloo's first brewery, it served as a hotel and storage area for its sister brewery, a source of alcohol during Canadian prohibition and eventually a cafe, restaurant and pub. It remains an architectural feature and gathering spot for uptown Waterloo. History The south east corner of the Huether The original building was started in 1855 by Wilhelm Rebscher, the original owner of the land in the area and operator of Waterloo's first brewery, the Lion Brewery which sits just north of the hotel. The brewery and hotel were bought by a father and son, Christopher and Adam Huether, both of whom worked in the brewery in 1856 when Rebscher died. The building and brewery were both expanded over the next 40 years, digging several caverns and tunnels under the hotel for storage. A Victorian facade was also added to the building in 1880. The hotel changed hands to Theresa Kuntz in 1899 when Christopher Huether died then to Albert Snyder in 1934 and the Adly family in 1953. Between 1934 and 1987, the premises where named the Kent Hotel, to attract a richer crowd. Current business \\"The Huether\\" no longer operates as a hotel but as a restaurant (Lion Brewery Restaurant), brewpub (Barley Works Pub and Grill), and cafe (Cafe 1842).

The Huether during prohibition In 1961, the Waterloo Works Department found a hole in a street adjacent the property and unwittingly unearthed a cavern and tunnel that had been dug out west of the Huether that is believed to have served as storage during prohibition, although the cavern itself likely dates to the Huether ownership during the late 19th century. Further excavations in 1981 also found foundations from a previous Malt house and Masonic lodge. The entire area was used to create room for the restaurant that is now on site.

George Haddad was born in the Jordanian city of Salt and lived in Irbid. He studied the language arts at Beirut Arab University (BAU). He started his career as a teacher; he was a pioneer in teaching like the most of his generation in Jordan, not only he knew syntax and morphology; but he also planted the awareness of leading their nations, the right of their nation upon them and the facts of the conflict with the colonizer, within the conscious of his students.  Career  He moved to media in 1971, working with the Jordanian radio, he worked as the chief of the political department then he moved to work in the Jordanian television as a political analyst and the founder of the Hebrew section, and was appointed as its head, then he was appointed as the manager for the news department in the television in 1974. Then as a political adviser in the ministry of media. In his time working in the Jordanian radio George met the martyr president Wasfi Al Tal, and he believed in Al Tal's project and approach, for building the modern Jordanian nation and its renaissance unionist speech, and this subject is objectively against the Hebrew project, and it is also against it judging by the construction and configuration and speech. And his relationship with president Al Tal flourished on a remarkable level; so he became closest to him, joined by the same intellectual and political orientation. = Ar-Ra'i Newspaper = He also had a daily job as a political writer in Al Ra'i newspaper since its establishment and until the beginning of the 1980s, then he transferred to Addustour newspaper where he persevered for a quarter of a century on writing his thoughts and social and intellectual and philosophical analysis under the column \\"Hazzet Ghrbal\\" (which means the \\"shake of a sieve\\"), and it‚Äôs a corner in the paper where he comes up with sayings and maxims and innovates them in a summarised, condensed and incredibly moving manner. His relationship with King Faisal. = King Faisal of Saudi Arabia = King Faisal Bin Abd Al Aziz was the King of Saudi Arabia, and was extremely fond with reading his articles. George Haddad was the first journalist who had the courage to praise Hamas Movement and its founder Ahmad Yaseen, and he had done so by writing a number of articles since it has started. He has some sung folkloric poems, as he noticed earlier to the importance of folk songs, and their role in transmitting the value of love, giving and life; he wrote a part of the words of the inspirational songs that the heritage and local folk share, he also prefers to talk in the known slang language in his dialogue despite his abundance in writing language. = Zionism = The columnist Fu'ad Husain described him saying: \\"George Haddad adored the valleys of Houran, and the mountains of Salt, and the streets of Amman, as he adored the alleys of Baghdad, and the people of Jerusalem, and Qasoun Mountain, all were to him parts of Great Syria and they are to its people and no one else, and the Zionists where only like the franks before them just passing by and nothing but passing words, as his grandparents fought the franks who tried to steal Christianity from its people in the east, George Haddad was fighting and rallying against the Zionist occupation, that occupation that despite its growth and strength it did not worry him, on the contrary, his mind was at comfort knowing that it is just a matter of time, and they will be gone exactly like all the invaders before them.\\"  Bibliography  * https://archive.is/20130411083128/http://isamallah.maktoobblog.com/1619115/ÿ∫ÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ¨Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨- ÿ≠ÿØÿßÿØŸàÿØÿßÿπÿßŸã/  References  * http://albaladoman.com/?p=3525 * https://archive.is/20130411073155/http://www.mahjoob.com/ar/forums/showthread.php?t=315213 20th-century Jordanian poets Jordanian journalists Year of birth missing Year of death missing 21st- century Jordanian poets ","title":"George Ibrahim Haddad"},{"id":"38648326","text":"1905 in philosophy  Events  Publications  Births  * February 2 - Ayn Rand (died 1982) * June 21 - Jean-Paul Sartre (died 1980)  Deaths  References  Philosophy Contemporary philosophy Philosophy by year ","title":"1905 in philosophy"},{"id":"38648328","text":"Deh Now (; also known as Shahr-e Now) is a village in Poshtkuh Rural District, Falard District, Lordegan County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran.
