Tucker, Photog.Camborne is a locality and former galena-mining town on the east side of the Incomappleux River, northeast of the head of Beaton Arm of Upper Arrow Lake in the Kootenay Country region of British Columbia. Mining became active in Camborne in 1899 with the Eva, Oyster, Beatrice and Silver Dollar mines. Camps and adits were started on the slopes as was town and millsite at the river level. The mines were a mixture of silver and gold, with lead and zinc considered secondary. Cory Mehinick was a Cornish hotel owner and mine operator. A road was built through the Fish Canyon to access the town from Beaton. The mines only operated for a few years and activity dropped precipitously after 1902. In 1930 with the Depression and the pegging of gold prices interest renewed in the area: the Oyster mine was re-worked under the Meridian name, and the True Fissure mine was explored in the upper valley at over 7000 feet elevation. A cat road was proposed but not built until the 1960s. Camborne became another Japanese internment camp after 1941. The Meridian mine was again reworked under the Sunshine Lardo name in the 1950s. Period buildings stood until recently, though vandals and logging have affected the area. The site is abandoned today although the name remains in use by a few local remaining area residents. Other towns and former towns in the region, which is known as Arrowhead (also the name of one of those towns), include Beaton, Comaplix and Galena Bay. Name origin The name is derived from that of the mining town of Camborne, Cornwall in England, or to the School of Mines in that town, which was a mining college of the time (1902). The name is thought to have been conferred by Cory Menhinick, a tinplate worker and mining engineer from Cornwall who had arrived in the region via Elwood, Indiana, then the location of the largest tinplate manufacturing operation in North America.

Early life Molteno was born in the Cape Colony, the second son of John Molteno, an Anglo-Italian immigrant who later served as the Cape's first Prime Minister. His father named him in honour of his old friend and business colleague, Percy John Alport. He attended Diocesan College (Bishops), took first place in the Cape matric examination and achieved academic honours at Trinity College, Cambridge, before being called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in London. Shipping magnate Union-Castle liners in Cape Town harbour. Early 1900s. After qualifying as a barrister and practising law in the Cape for several years, he moved to Britain to accept a partnership in the firm of Donald Currie & Company, managers of the Castle (later, the Union-Castle) Line and even married Sir Donald Currie's daughter Elizabeth. As chairman of the Union Castle Company he oversaw a massive expansion in export shipping lines from Southern Africa, eventually, through these shipping lines, controlling the routes of the bulk of southern Africa's foreign trade.H.H. Hewison: Hedge of Wild Almonds: South Africa, the Pro-Boers & the Quaker Conscience, 1890-1910. James Currey Publishers:London, 1989. From the beginning, he saw great potential in South Africa's agricultural exports. His father had undertaken the first experimental export of fruit as a young man in 1841, loading a ship with dried fruit for the Australian market. Percy however, was keenly interested in the possibility of using the new science of refrigeration to allow South African produce to be successfully shipped to the enormous European consumer markets, thereby opening them up for South African exports. Having a scientific frame of mind, he embarked on an extensive process of research and experiments in refrigeration techniques for large shipping vessels. The end result was that he developed and brought in new refrigeration methods to allow for the first successful introduction of South African fruit to European and other overseas markets. On 31 January 1892, when the first shipment arrived in Britain, John X. Merriman from the Cape Government accompanied him to see the cases opened, and when case after case opened in perfect condition, the relief and joy was immense. Land prices in the Cape immediately shot up, and a new economic chapter was opened for Southern Africa.De Beer, G. 160 Years of Export. Cape Town: PPECB, 2003. p.21-27. At the same time, he established Southern Africa's first fruit export organisation, with an eye to developing and controlling the Cape's agricultural exports. Although this was originally set up as a syndicate with other members of his family (particularly his brothers William and John Molteno), he soon shared his discoveries and influenced many other shipping companies to install refrigeration chambers on their vessels.Murray, M: Union- Castle Chronicle: 1853-1953. Longmans Green, 1953. p.314 Nonetheless, in the ensuing decades, it was his two youngest brothers, Edward and Harry Molteno, who eventually took over most of southern Africa's export fruit industry.P.B. Simons: Apples of the sun : being an account of the lives, vision and achievements of the Molteno brothers. Vlaeberg: Fernwood Press, 1999. De Beer, G. 160 Years of Export. Cape Town: PPECB, 2003. p.14. He is consequently regarded as the pioneer of the South African export fruit industry.Fruit and Food Technology Research Institute, Stellenbosch: Information Bulletin no.22.(1971) Political career Molteno as a young man Molteno served as a liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom, where he came to represent a radical wing of the British Liberal Party. He had originally needed to move to London to oversee his vast network of international shipping lines, but he remained deeply attached to southern Africa. His close friend the activist John Tengo Jabavu called him \\"a true son of the soil, and a South African patriot I know and admire\\".Phyllis Lewsen (ed.). Selections from the correspondence of John X. Merriman, 1905-1924. South Africa: Van Riebeeck Society, 1969. p.132. He also remained closely involved in its politics, through his many influential family members, as well as through his friendship with nearly all of the most powerful South African politicians and businessmen. He was a prolific letter-writer who corresponded with many of the leading political figures of the colony. His writings and politics were guided by two main themes: his advocacy of responsible government and his staunch opposition to the Boer War. Those views made him a divisive figure both inside and outside the Liberal Party, of which he was a member: Winston Churchill once refused to attend a dinner if they were sitting together, and Henry Simpson Lunn reports fearing that his windows would be smashed if word got out that Molteno was present at his club. Southern Africa in the late 1800s; with the Cape Colony coloured blue, and the Boer republics in orange Opposition to the Boer War In the early 1890s, the rise of aggressively imperialist politicians such as Rhodes, Chamberlain and Milner heralded a change in British policy regarding Southern Africa, and the earliest signs of the coming war. From very early on, Molteno foresaw the nature of the upcoming catastrophe and, through his correspondence with the leading politicians of the day, sought to warn them, and attack \\"official ignorance in high places of the realities in South Africa\\". As the war drew nearer, he threw his influence and fortune behind the minority \\"peace party\\" (which now included his colleagues \\"Onze Jan\\" Hofmeyr, Jacobus W. Sauer and John X. Merriman), and he severed business relations with Rhodes and other prominent figures, whom he saw as instigators. He was also a chairman of the South Africa Conciliation Committee.The South Africa Conciliaton Committee, list of names and addresses (1899). National Press Agency, London. SACC. 1899. Finally, when war broke out, he took his place in the heart of British society as openly \\"Pro- Boer\\".Davey, Arthur (1978). The British pro-Boers, 1877-1902. South Africa: Tafelberg. . Not surprisingly the effects of such political activism on his business empire were devastating. In 1896, after the Jameson Raid, he wrote to the William Schreiner: :\\"What a blow to all our hopes of friendly feeling and consolidation of races has been given by the wicked attempt of foolish men, elated by the enormous gains which Africa has yielded to them - what a miserable return to have made to her for such benefits!\\" Molteno was prominent in condemning the British forces' use of 'scorched earth' tactics against the Boer guerrillas. Postwar reconstruction In the years following the Boer War, Molteno withdrew from the shipping trade and devoted both himself and his remaining fortune to postwar humanitarian efforts in South Africa. Having returned to South Africa to see what he could do to \\"salvage something from the wreckage\\" and experience first-hand where need was most urgent, Molteno traveled extensively through the war-ravaged country, setting up relief funds and even adopting war orphans. The degree of his involvement surprised even his fellow liberals; as Catherine Courtney wrote to him in 1902, \\"You seem to spend yourself body, soul and fortune as if the war lay on your conscience alone\\".Letter from Catherine Courtney to Molteno, 23.8.1902 Furious about Lord Kitchener 's use of scorched earth tactics and concentration camps against the Boers, he also continued the work that he had started during the height of the war with Emily Hobhouse, exposing the atrocities and setting up institutions for the rehabilitation of survivors.http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/uploads/47-Summer%25202005.pdf Movement towards Union Molteno entered the British House of Commons as the Member for Dumfriesshire in 1906, and soon used his increased parliamentary influence in the direction of the granting of full Responsible Government to the \\"ex-Republics\\" in southern Africa. John Tengo Jabavu, educator and activist, was a close friend and political ally of Molteno. He was deeply involved in the process leading up to the Union of South Africa in 1910. He was also the adviser and confidant of a number of leading South African statesmen during this process.Phyllis Lewsen (ed.). Selections from the correspondence of John X. Merriman, 1905-1924. South Africa: Van Riebeeck Society, 1969. p.164. Molteno saw the upcoming union as politically inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing. He had, after all, been advocating the ending of animosities between Briton and Boer for years. However, he was deeply concerned about the movement to unite the Afrikaners and British diaspora in a common policy of politically excluding the Black South Africans. General Louis Botha, Boer war hero and first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. Molteno had been acutely aware of the earliest beginnings of that tendency many years earlier, and it increasingly became his primary concern about the political future of South Africa. It also led him to intensify his support for the cause of black African nationalist movements, and activists such as John Tengo Jabavu. Jabavu was a political ally and old friend of his brothers, the Cape Members of Parliament John and James Molteno, and had worked with Percy from the time of the Boer War.L.D. Ngcongco: Jabavu and the Anglo-Boer War. South Africa: Kleio, 1970. Molteno was particularly involved in Jabavu's \\"Imvo Zabantsundu\\" newspaper, in which he also had shares, and decades later, when Jabavu's son wrote his father's biography, he dedicated it to their family friend as \\"...a token of thanks, for deeds of true friendship to the hero of this work.\\"D.D.T. Jabavu: The Life of John Tengo Jabavu. South Africa: Lovedale. 1922 In addition, during this time he used his influence in both Africa & London to attack the pass laws in the Boer republics, their \\"brutal\\" labour laws, the practise of flogging, the morality act, discriminatory taxation (the hut tax), restricted land rights, martial law with its closing down of black African political publications, and the recommendations of the Native Affairs Commission.L.M. Thompson: The Unification of South Africa, 1902-1910. Oxford, 1960. Molteno supported the extension of the Cape's multiracial \\"Cape Qualified Franchise\\" into a system of universal franchise across South Africa. It was widely known that it would inevitably result in black majority rule. However, the political predicament on the eve of Union was that it course of action was supported only by a few white liberals and black politicians in the Cape, and the overwhelming majority of the predominantly-white electorate across Southern Africa was strongly opposed to that outcome. Besides, the British government was inclined to support the opposition. Thus, supporters of universal franchise, led by JW Sauer, Cape Prime Minister Merriman and Molteno himself, fought a losing battle, and General Louis Botha rode the wave of white public opinion to power by publicly opposing nonracial politics.M.A. Grundlingh: The Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, 1872-1910. Archives Year Book for South African History, 1969, Vol II.Phyllis Lewsen: Merriman as last Cape Prime Minister. The South African Historical Journal. Nov 1975. A final compromise saved a weak form of qualified franchise but only in the liberal Cape. Molteno, who increasingly saw even the qualified franchise as insufficiently inclusive, called the compromise \\"pathetic\\" and predicted a worsening struggle over the issue of political rights. His later letters to Botha and Merriman (1914) warn of history repeating itself in \\"poor South Africa\\" and of approaching troubles to which he could see no end.P.A. Molteno (1914): Letter dated 13 February 1914. Edited by J.W.E. van de Poel. South African Library: The Merriman Papers. Later life and humanitarian work Percy Molteno in later life Developments after the Union like the rise of Afrikaner nationalism and Apartheid led to his disillusionment with South African politics and his increasing devotion to humanitarian issues such as the Vienna Emergency Relief Fund, which he started in 1919. In South Africa, he publicly supported and donated large sums of money to the fundraising activities of John Dube and the infant African National Congress (ANC). In addition, he later offered his name and international network of connections to assist Dube and his cause.Heather Hughes: The First President: A Life of John L. Dube, Founding President of the ANC. Jacana Media, 2011. p.153. Sol Plaatje was another African nationalist to receive his support.Brian Willan: Sol Plaatje, South African nationalist, 1876-1932. Heinemann, 1984. p.186. Molteno was a rationalist and a great supporter of scientific endeavour (The Molteno Institute was his endowment to Cambridge University in 1921). His scientific work was primarily with refrigeration and hydro-electricity (he designed the hydro-electric power station at Glen Lyon), but he had a passion for Biology and was a keen student of Darwin, Huxley and Herbert Spencer. He also shared his father's love of animals. This may have been one of the reasons why, though he was an excellent shot, he never joined in the hunts which were a popular pastime of the wealthy at the time. In his personal beliefs, he was an atheist (though he preferred the term \\"Lucretian\\") and founded the Common Sense magazine where he intended writers to present articles on controversial issues of the time that were based on reason, evidence and ethics, rather than on emotion and nationalism. He was also a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, chairman of the South African Real Estate Corporation, and a founder of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, together with Otto Beit and Baron Rothschild. In person, family friend Selous described him \\"acutely intelligent\\" and unusually open-minded. A very unostentatious man who despised flatterers and timeservers, he, throughout his life, repeatedly refused titles and honours, though his influence behind the scenes was immense. Famously, when Prime Minister Botha refused to attend the first Imperial Conference in 1907 to discuss Union, it was a personal and undisclosed cable from Molteno that brought Botha to London in a cooperative frame of mind. Molteno's family was originally Italian and, throughout his life, he visited Italy for extended periods. He was particularly attached to the island of Sicily and, in his later life, he spent more time there. He died in 1937 at the age of 76, on a trip to Zurich.

Their son Richard was born in 1924. Career as a writer Beers achieved considerable national acclaim for her novels, all of which were set in the northern plains. While still in her mid-twenties, she attracted the interest of major New York publisher E. P. Dutton, whose editors took pains to debut her as a “literary” writer (as opposed to a writer of romances). When Prairie Fires was published in 1925, Louis Kronenberger writing in the Saturday Review of Literature called it \\"a modern epic of the soil\\" and \\"a spacious novel\\" with \\"vitality, variety, a power of making its narrative march....\\" Kronenberger, Louis, \\"A Novel of the Soil: Prairie Fires by Lorna Doone Beers,\\" Saturday Review of Literature, July 11, 1925, p. 891. Respected critic Robert Morss Lovett wrote in The New Republic, “There is something Russian about this book, and there is also something very American about it.” Lovett praised “its truth to essential conditions.”Quoted in publisher’s materials provided by E.P. Dutton and Company with the first edition of The Mad Stone, 1932. Prairie Fires was lauded in The New Yorker in three separate issues.See The New Yorker issues of August 7, July 25, and September 12, 1925. In 1929 Beers published A Humble Lear, which an Ohio reviewer described “as an amazingly gripping novel of farm life,” and the New York Times Book Review characterized as “absorbing because it is real.”Quoted in publisher’s materials provided by E.P. Dutton and Company with the first edition of The Mad Stone, 1932. Lorna Beers second novel, published in 1929. Published in 1932 and the winner of a prestigious Avery Hopwood Award at the University of Michigan, The Mad Stone was enthusiastically promoted by Dutton as “an example of the pure American novel.” It was “a contribution to American literature,” the publisher said.Quoted in publisher’s materials provided by E.P. Dutton and Company with the first edition of The Mad Stone, 1932. Beers’ career as a serious novelist would last no longer, however, than this eventful ten-year period between the early twenties and the appearance of The Mad Stone. Despite the early promise, she never published another novel. (The same period was similarly fruitful for another small town Minnesotan, Sinclair Lewis, who was developing some of the same themes in Main Street, Babbitt, and Elmer Gantry before becoming the first American winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.) After 1932, and during the decade of the 1940s, Beers attempted no sustained writing efforts as ambitious as novels. Her time and energies were increasingly consumed, she would tell confidants years later, by caring for her husband, who was plagued by emotional problems, including crippling phobias.Chambers, Lorna Beers. Personal interview with Jay Divine, Staunton, Virginia, February, 1975. During this time the couple lived mostly in Summit, New Jersey, within commuting distance of Manhattan where Ray Chambers worked in the investment community. In the 1950s, Beers produced two perennially popular books for young readers that are still being read today, The Book of Hugh Flower (1952) and The Crystal Cornerstone (1955). In 1966, W.W.Norton published Wild Apples and North Wind, her lyrical and haunting memoir of living on a farm in Vermont. This book brought back some of the passion and intensity of her novels, but at a distant, bittersweet remove from the prairie narratives. Its acute, understated descriptions of the intersections between nature and people echo Robert Frost and anticipate Annie Dillard.The Mad Stone won the prestigious Hopwood Award in 1932. Later years The couple retired to a 150-year-old farmhouse in rural Vermont in the late 1950s. Through the sixties and into the seventies Beers was a frequent contributor of poetry, stories, and short pieces to publications like Harper's, Yankee, The New England Galaxy, The Sign, and the Christian Science Monitor. August Derleth selected one of her poems for Fire and Sleet and Candlelight, an anthology devoted to works on fantasy and the macabre by living poets.Derleth, August, ed. Fire and Sleet and Candlelight. Arkham House, 1961. By 1966, the couple moved to Staunton, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. Widowed in 1974, Beers lived quietly there with her widowed daughter-in-law, whom she adored, on a shady hill above a lovely women’s college campus. The walls of her old house were lined floor to ceiling with thousands of books. She died in 1989 at age 92. Among her papers was a completed first draft of another novel.Ms. Beers submitted a copy of this manuscript for review to close friends in the spring of 1977. Literary reputation The readership of Lorna Beers can be said to be at a very low ebb today.(All three of her novels are not only out of print but actually qualify as rare books.) Even short biographical articles are difficult to find. Beers’ popular audience today is composed largely of teachers and parents or grandparents who were touched by her children’s books in the 1950s, or somehow came across Wild Apples and North Wind in the 1960s. (It is now long out of print as well). There is a continuing interest in her novels, however, by professors and graduate students in literature, and they continue to be a focus of doctoral dissertations and scholarly articles on the literature of the plains states, or early twentieth century feminist authors, or American literary regionalism.

Before she can join him in Tunis, Said asks that she give him a son. On the island Djerba, Aïcha lives under the rule of her mother-in-law, with a few other wives, while their husbands work elsewhere. Aïcha eventually gives birth to a son and is allowed to move to Tunis with her husband. However, her son Aziz has developmental problems and is likely autistic, which causes Saïd to reject him. Aïcha returns to Djerba, this time with her son Aziz and her two adult daughters. The film uses extended flashbacks between Aïcha and her young daughters living in Djerba prior to the birth of Aziz and then scenes in the present, where Aziz is about eight, just before she moves back to Djerba. The film ends with Aïcha and Aziz working together on the loom, making tapestries that Aïcha sells. The film ends with Aïcha's younger daughter Emna leaving, which Aïcha and Aziz live together in Djerba. Major characters * Aïcha: the main character. She is married to Saïd and has a strong will and mind of her own. Though she struggles, she wants the best life for her children. * Saïd: Aïcha's husband.

The community elected the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly in 1955 and an independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1977. The country has experienced large migrations and the size of the Baháʼí community has also dramatically changed. In the most recent cycle the 2002 national census showed about 0.1%, or 500, Baháʼís mostly in three of its Regions though Baháʼís were noted in every Region. However, by 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 13,000 Baháʼís. Baháʼís are now widely distributed across Guyana and are represented in all major racial groups and regions. The Baháʼí community, while relatively small, is well known for its emphasis on unity, non-involvement in politics and its work in issues such as literacy and youth issues.  Early Phase   ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan  ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Baháʼí community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unavailing in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. Root's travels to Latin America began in the summer of 1919. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. > \\"His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the > world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God. ... the republic of > Mexico ... to be familiar with the Spanish language ... Guatemala, Honduras, > Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the seventh country Belize ... > Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America ... Likewise > the islands of ... Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, ... Bahama Islands, > even the small Watling Island ... Haiti and Santo Domingo ... the islands of > Bermuda ... the republics of the continent of South America—Colombia, Ec­or, > Peru, Brazil, the Guianas, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, > Venezuela; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, > such as Falkland Islands, the Galapagòs, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and > Trinidad. ...\\" Following the release of these tablets and then ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Baháʼís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America. In 1927 Leonora Armstrong made public mention of the religion in the capital city of Georgetown of what was then British Guiana.  Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades  Shoghi Effendi, who was named ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > \\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Baháʼí Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous > stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Baháʼu'lláh and establish structural basis of His > World Order.\\" Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. In 1936 Dudley M. Blakely, after becoming a Baháʼí in 1920, embarked with Elsa, his wife, on worldwide travels to promote the religion and traveled to Guyana for several weeks to promulgate the religion. During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Baháʼís communities and assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America.  Establishment of the community  The first Baháʼí to settle in Guyana was Dr. Malcolm King, a Jamaican, who traveled from his home in the United States in 1953 via Trinidad. In 1955 the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Guyana in Georgetown. Following the election of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of South America in 1950, in 1957 this assembly was split into two - basically northern/eastern South America and one of the western/southern South America. In 1963 smaller groups of Baháʼís were known in Campelville, Kitty and Lodge Village (now suburbs of Georgetown), Grove and Providence (both in Demerara-Mahaica in East Bank Demerara), and MacKenzie (now part of Linden).thumb In August 1965 the Baháʼís of Georgetown hosted a regional conference with Hand of the Cause Jalál Kházeh and Baháʼís from British, French and Dutch Guiana, northern Brazil, eastern Venezuela and Trinidad attending. In early February, 1968 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum visited giving public talks, visiting a school for the blind, and civic leaders. In 1970 the Baháʼís of Guyana, Surinamé and French Guiana first elected a regional National Spiritual Assembly. Rúhíyyih Khanum represented the Universal House of Justice at the convention to elect the assembly. There were 54 delegates representing at least 10 assemblies in Guyana, 3 in Surinamé and 3 in French Guiana. The members elected were Jamshid Ar-jomandi; Henry Dolphin; August Holland; Cheryl Plerre; Ellen Widmer; Mr. Rivadavia da Silva, Eileen Hill, Ivan Fraser, and Daisy Hahnfeld. While there Rúhíyyih Khanum again spoke to the public press and civic leaders this time including then President Arthur Chung. Her comments dwelt on the Baháʼí teachings of the oneness of humanity and ending racial prejudices. The first regional Baha'i Youth Conference was held in Paramaribo, December 29 through 31, 1972. The Conference was especially for Baha'i youth of Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Guyana, Surinam and French Guiana. A sixth youth conference was held in 1979. Meanwhile, in 1975 the National Assembly asked for guidance from the Universal House of Justice on the approach to respond to requirements of national service which advised such service for agriculture was approved while trying to minimize the chances of service requiring combat. Early in 1976 the first members of the Macushi and Wai Wai tribes joined the religion. In December 1976 the assembly was able to officially incorporate. In 1977 the Surinamé and French Guiana communities organized their own national assembly and Guyana elected an independent assembly. The elected members of the first National Assembly of Guyana were Sheila Dolphin, Henry Dolphin, Ellen Widmer, Frank Sheffey, Ivan Fraser, Eileen Hill, David Morris, Rooplall Doodnauth, and Krishna Seegopaul. Meanwhile, pioneers continue to arrive in Guyana. In July and August 1980 Shanaz Furudi, a Baháʼí from India toured Guyana and addressing the public and offering training for Baháʼí institutions. Guyanese residents of Asian Indian extraction learned of the religion's situation there. While she was there the first Baháʼí of the Arecuna (see Pemon) converted. Guyanese citizens have also moved to other countries where some have become Baháʼís as well.  Modern community  Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In Guyana in 1980 saw the first Baháʼí women's conference. A main topic through the conference was the role of women in religion as well topics dealing with life in the tropics. In April 1981 more than 60 artists attended a workshop set up by five Baháʼí artists which presented workshops emphasizing spiritual issues and introduced Baháʼí sand-painter David Villasenor to the Guyanese. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In the 1980s the Guyanese Baháʼí community's established an Office of Social and Economic Development which consulted with rural communities on a needs assessment which focused on the issue of literacy. In 1984 Baháʼí Frank Fernandes, a native of Guyana, was the guest of honor at a dinner of civic leaders followed by a piano recital at, and a fundraiser for, the National Cultural Centre for an audience of 250. One response of the community was to contact the Baháʼí communities in Canada, the US, and the UK. Together they made arrangements for 40,000 reading books which became the basis of libraries in 65 villages. Training workshops were organized with the cooperation of the Ministry of Education which were developed in the context of the Macushi and Wapashana languages. As recently as 2000 Baháʼís were noted contributing to the training of 1500 teachers for this project. Also in the 1980s some Baháʼís opened a private school - the School of the Nations in Guyana, an all age private Baháʼí inspired school. There are 650 full-time students (representing 22 nationalities) and 300 adults who pursue the International General Certificate of Secondary Education in the evenings. In 1988 represented a year of multiple events. In April an inter-Guyana conference of Baháʼís was held. In May Baháʼí youth mobilized for activities from which over 200 converted. In June two Baháʼí physicians from Great Britain visited Guyana for two weeks to conduct lectures and work at Georgetown Public Hospital and then toured the country at Baháʼí events. In 1992 the government of Guyana honored the Baháʼís by releasing stamps overprinted noting the Baháʼí Holy Year in 1992. In 1999 the national assembly contributed to the dialogue on the reform of the Constitution of Guyana. In the 2000s Baháʼí organizations cooperated with projects to fight the spread of poverty and AIDs among youth - as well as studies on the effectiveness of religion in motivating people to deal with social ills. In 2002 the Baháʼís collectively and individually contributed to the Guyana Peace Education Institute at its inauguration and to discussions on reform held at the Muslim Youth Organization office. Youth workshops were noted in 2006 presenting patterns for change to cycles of social ills like alcoholism and family violence and participated in national discussions and exhibitions on ethnic relations by the National Commission on Ethnic Relations in 2006 and dialogues on religious tolerance. The Baháʼí community was also noted for its support for inter-religious activities through the Inter-Religious Organization (IRO), a nongovernmental umbrella organization for Christian, Hindu, Islamic, and Baháʼí organizations, and the Ethnic Relations Commission.  Demographics  Baháʼís sources state there were 110 members in 1969 and that by 1989 there were 22,000 (with 11,000 joining the religion in a three-month period in 1989.) C. 1990–1996 there are claims of the Baháʼís population being over 5% of the population. Large migrations, including many Baháʼís, left Guyana for other places, especially New York and Toronto. By the time of the 2002 national census the Baháʼí population had ebbed to about 0.1%, or 500, Baháʼís mostly in Regions 3, 4, and 6 though Baháʼís were noted in every Region. However, by 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 13,000 Baháʼís. More recently the National Assembly mentioned adding assemblies in Lethem, Corentyne and Essequibo. Baháʼís are now widely distributed across Guyana and represent all major racial groups and regions. The Baháʼí community, while relatively small, is well known for its emphasis on unity, non-involvement in politics and its work in issues such as literacy and youth issues.

It was converted into a clinical centre and medical library for the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1991.Mercer's Medical Centre History The hospital has its origins in a house established by Mary Mercer for the shelter of poor girls in 1724. Following Mary Mercer's death, in 1734, a number of eminent surgeons took over the running of the facility and converted it into a hospital. The political pamphleteer, Jonathan Swift, was on its first board of governors. To support funding for the hospital a number of concerts were arranged over the following years. The most significant of these was the first performance of Handel's Messiah, which took place in the Ancient Musick Rooms in Fishamble Street on 13 April 1742. To provide room for a large audience, ladies were requested to lay aside their hoops and gentlemen their swords. By this means an audience of 700 was crowded into the space, and the concert realised £400. The hospital was completely rebuilt to a design by J.H. Brett in 1884.Fleetwood, 1983 In the late 19th century Mercer's was one of the chief teaching hospitals in Dublin; it was located close to several schools of medicine, including Kirby's and the Ledwich school (run by Thomas Ledwich) in Peter Street. Ledwich's brother, Edward, became surgeon and lecturer at the hospital. Among other surgeons who practised there in the latter half of the 19th century were Edward Stamer O'Grady.Fealy, p. 33 In the late 1880s trouble broke out among the staff, leading to charges being brought against Dr. O'Grady, senior surgeon at the hospital. In October 1887 he was accused of insulting his professional colleagues to such an extent that they were unable to work with him. He had also charged one of the members of the board with loitering in the female ward for immodest purposes.Irish Times, October 1887 Some of the staff left. Lectures were disrupted and the numbers of students fell. The row continued into the 1890s until finally he and most of the staff were dismissed by the governors, and he refused to seek re-election. O'Grady died at home on 18 October 1897.British Medical Journal, 23 October 1897 A new management team was appointed under the rule of Dr. (\\"Bull\\") Elliott in 1898: among them was Sir John Lumsden. The hospital closed in 1983 and was acquired by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland who converted it into a clinical centre and medical library in 1991. Notable physicians Among the notable physicians who have been associated with Mercer's Hospital are: *Francis L'Estrange (1756–1836), physician born in County Westmeath who was educated as a surgeon. In 1779 he was appointed Assistant Surgeon to Mercer's Hospital, where he later became surgeon. He was later appointed Assistant Surgeon to the House of Industry Hospitals, and surgeon to the Marine School. He engaged in obstetrical practice and was present at the birth of the poet, Thomas Moore (1779). He became president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1796. *John Lumsden (1869–1944), the Principal Medical Officer for the Commissioners of Irish Lights, Chief Medical Officer at the Guinness Brewery and founder of the St John Ambulance Ireland.History of The St John Ambulance Brigade in Ireland *J.

The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show was a live-action theatrical presentation featuring dangerous-appearing stunts in a scripted presentation along with various mechanical and pyrotechnic special effects. The show was first mounted at Universal Studios Hollywood, opening in 1980. History The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show was a live stunt show at Universal Studios Hollywood, based upon a hodgepodge of Universal's Western films. Opening in 1980 in the upper lot section of the park, the show featured cowboy-themed actors surviving death-defying stunts, shootings and explosions. The show closed in 2002, leaving the arena abandoned except for its use during Halloween Horror Nights and Grinchmas. It was finally demolished in 2012. The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show was also opened at Universal Studios Florida on July 4, 1991, in the Amity section of the park. The show was nearly an exact recreation of the show from USH, although the amphitheater was more modern and better appointed. The show closed on September 1, 2003, and was replaced by Fear Factor Live which opened on June 3, 2005. A similar show is still shown at former Universal-owned theme park PortAventura Park. The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show opened on March 31, 2001, in the Western Town section of Universal Studios Japan. The show closed in 2006 and has since been replaced by Wicked. The Western Area, and with it The Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show and the Animal Actors show, were revamped to become Land of Oz in 2006. This involved completely re-theming two live shows, one restaurant, and a number of retail facilities. A re-themed version of this show was opened at Wakayama Marina City's Porto Europa Theme Park under the title Viking Adventure. Although featuring Vikings rather than cowboys, the script was virtually the same, and the major stunts were re- created verbatim. This included the high fall onto a wooden breakaway platform, and the climactic \\"falling facade\\" gag. The show is now closed.

The story is centered on the sudden disappearance of honey bees from beehives around the world, caused by the poorly understood phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD. Although the film does not draw any firm scientific conclusions as to the precise cause or causes of CCD, it does suggest a link between neonicotinoid pesticides and CCD. The UK cinema release of the film was supported by The Co- operative Group.  Cast  * David Hackenberg as himself * Michael Pollan as himself * Simon Buxton as himself * Emilia Fox as narrator (UK release) * Ellen Page as narrator (US release) Reception The film was first released in the UK with a British narration by Emilia Fox and received mixed reviews from critics, achieving a rating of 62 percent on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. Filmstar called Vanishing of the Bees “The most important documentary film since An Inconvenient Truth.” And Stuart McGurk of The Sunday Times wrote that while the \\"subject is serious\\", and this film was \\"well intentioned and urgent\\", it was \\"let down by hammy narration, [and] a made-for-TV budget\\". Philip French of The Observer called it a \\"serious, didactic, rather rambling documentary [that] features some good, decent people\\". He added that \\"The blame falls principally on pesticides (which began when chemical warfare techniques were switched to farming), monoculture (ie, the widespread specialisation in single crops), genetic engineering and the world's changing landscape. Governments, the film charges, are listening more closely to the producers of chemicals than to beekeepers.\\" The film was then re-released in the US with a new edit and narration by Ellen Page.

Williams defeated his fellow city council member, Democrat Roy Cary, an African-American, 38,596 votes (59 percent) to 27,018 (41 percent). Eliminated in the nonpartisan blanket primary was the Democratic former Mayor John Brennan Hussey. As his chief administrative officer, Mayor Williams chose Wendell Fraser Collins (1938-2018), a native of Many in Sabine Parish and a former long-term employee of AT&T.; In 1990, Williams was elected to a single term on the Shreveport City Council from District E. He received, 6,293 votes (53 percent) to Democrat John L. Albritton's 5,503 ballots (47 percent). He left the council after one term to become mayor. Williams was physically impaired as mayor. He used a wheelchair as a result of an accident several years earlier and had limited upper-body movement. Former Mayor James C. Gardner in his memoirs entitled Jim Gardner and Shreveport, Vol. II, describes Williams as follows: > I came to realize that most Shreveporters did not comprehend the physical > limitations of the mayor. This was to handicap him politically as he could > not be as physically visible as the citizens were accustomed . ... and this > was sometimes interpreted as lack of activity. ... Mayor Williams > compensated for his physical limitations by his study of city government. He > knew his facts and figures: he did his homework. ...

Gardner claims that I-49 was not a priority of Governor Murphy J. \\"Mike\\" Foster, Jr., the Republican who served from 1996 to 2004. In the 1998 nonpartisan blanket primary, Williams ran a weak second and withdrew from a pending general election. Democratic candidate Keith Paul Hightower, the District C council member from southeast Shreveport, led with 20,250 votes (42 percent) to Williams' 13,637 (28 percent). Three other candidates, two Democrats and another Republican, divided the remaining 30 percent of the ballots. Williams, who trailed by nearly 7,000 votes, declined to proceed to a second round of balloting, and Hightower hence won the position outright. Hightower served two terms. Williams and his wife, the former Melba Clark (born 1939), reside in Shreveport.

They differ from the crystalline nappes in that they were originally part of the European plate, while the Penninic nappes were part of the crust below various domains in the Tethys Ocean.Schmid et al. (2004) The external massifs are the Argentera in the Alpes Maritimes, the Pelvoux massif and the Belledonne range in the Dauphiné part of the French Alps, the Aiguilles Rouges in the Savoy part of the French Alps, the Mont Blanc Massif at the borders between France, Italy and Switzerland and the Aarmassif and Gotthardmassif in the Central Alps of Switzerland. The massifs are composed of the basement of the former margin of the European plate, consisting of metamorphic and igneous rocks of Hercynian age or older. The Mesozoic cover that was originally on top of these rock has mostly been detached by thin skinned thrusting about 40 to 25 million years ago (Ma).Pfiffner (2009) At some places along the Aarmassif, the Mesozoic cover is partly still lying conformally on top of the Hercynian basement rock, this Mesozoic is called the Infrahelvetic complex.

Mr. Stensby resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of Premier Cruises in the fall of 1997 after growing the company to annualized revenues in excess of $200 million, an operating profit in excess of 20% and more than 3,000 employees, making Premier Cruises, with its 5,500 lower berths, the largest privately-held cruise line in the world at the time. Post-1997 Premier Cruises (under new ownership and management led by Bruce Nierenberg)http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/board- management-changes/6668678-1.html changed their business strategies and decided to cancel their marketing agreements with international marketing partners such as Thomson Holidays, Pullmantur and others and decided to reposition a number of their ships back to the United States.HighBeamhttp://www.rosling.com/ss.islandbreeze/ A number of these marketing partners used this opportunity to establish their own cruise operations, such as Pullmantur in Spain who established their own cruise operations (Pullmantur Cruises) after the cancellation of their partnership with Premier Cruises. Pullmantur Cruises, through its parent company, was purchased by Royal Caribbean International in 2006. Thomson Holidays also used the opportunity to build and expand their cruise operation post 1997 and is now part of the largest travel group in the world TUI. Premier Cruises filed for bankruptcy in late 2000 and ceased operations.  Premier Cruise Line  Premier Cruise Line was formed in 1983 by two cruise veterans, Bjornar Hermansen and Bruce Nierenberg, under a licensing agreement with the Walt Disney World Resort, and was the direct predecessor to the Disney Cruise Line. In 1992, The Walt Disney Company decided to establish their own cruise line and terminated their licensing agreements with the company. Premier then entered into a similar licensing agreement with Warner Bros. featuring the Looney Tunes characters, in order to maintain its family friendly image. The line continued to operate offering land/sea vacation packages including visits to Disney World and Universal Studios theme parks in Florida. Some Premier Cruises vessels were still operating until fairly recently, such as the SS Oceanic (\\"Big Red Boat\\"), which was sold by Pullmantur (a Royal Caribbean company) in April 2009 to Japan-based Peace Boat, and the SS Rembrandt, formerly known as the SS Rotterdam, was purchased by an investor group in the Netherlands, to be restored and kept as an historic landmark in the city of Rotterdam.

Bucholz photog.Halcyon Hot Springs, originally Halcyon Hotsprings, also known simply as Halcyon, was a hot springs resort and spa located on the east side of Upper Arrow Lake, between Galena Bay and Nakusp, in the Kootenay Country of British Columbia, Canada. Halcyon Mountain nearby to the northeast derives its name from the resort. History The springs were well-known to the Sinixt and Ktunaxa peoples, who fought over ownership of the springs and of the Arrow Lakes region in general. The name Halycon was conferred by Robert Sanderson, a steamboat captain who staked a mineral claim here and opened the first hotel in 1894, in reference to that word's meaning of contentment (see halcyon). The springs attained a worldwide reputation and water from them was bottled for export, reaching customers in London. When the local mining rush ended and steamboat traffic stopped, the hotel changed hands a number of times and became rundown. In 1924, British Army Brigadier-General Dr. Frederick Burnham, who was a surgeon, revamped the hotel as a sanatorium. In 1955, the hotel burnt to the ground, taking with it the life of Dr. Burnham. The site was abandoned due to lack of road access, although a resort has since been rebuilt. Tourism Halcyon Hot Springs, also known as Halcyon Hot Springs Resort & Spa, is a popular travel destination in British Columbia, found 35 km north of Nakusp, BC on the Upper Arrow Lake. Halcyon Hot Springs Resort & Spa is open to the public year round and has two natural hot spring pools, a cold plunge pool and a seasonal swimming pool, located directly on the beautiful Upper Arrow Lake. The Resort is equipped with a full-service restaurant, 'The Kingfisher', that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Wi-Fi Direct is single-hop communication, rather than multihop communication like wireless/mobile ad hoc networks. Wi-Fi becomes a way of communicating wirelessly, much like Bluetooth. It is useful for everything from internet browsing to file transfer, and to communicate with one or more devices simultaneously at typical Wi-Fi speeds. One advantage of Wi-Fi Direct is the ability to connect devices even if they are from different manufacturers. Only one of the Wi-Fi devices needs to be compliant with Wi-Fi Direct to establish a peer-to-peer connection that transfers data directly between them with greatly reduced setup. Wi-Fi Direct negotiates the link with a Wi-Fi Protected Setup system that assigns each device a limited wireless access point. The \\"pairing\\" of Wi-Fi Direct devices can be set up to require the proximity of a near field communication, a Bluetooth signal, or a button press on one or all the devices. Background Basic Wi-Fi Conventional Wi-Fi networks are typically based on the presence of controller devices known as wireless access points. These devices normally combine three primary functions: * Physical support for wireless and wired networking * Bridging and routing between devices on the network * Service provisioning to add and remove devices from the network. A typical Wi-Fi home network includes laptops, tablets and phones, devices like modern printers, music devices, and televisions. The majority of Wi-Fi networks are set up in \\"infrastructure mode\\", where the access point acts as a central hub to which Wi-Fi capable devices are connected. The devices do not communicate directly with each other (that is, in \\"ad-hoc mode\\"), but they go through the access point. In contrast, Wi-Fi Direct devices are able to communicate with each other without requiring a dedicated wireless access point. The Wi-Fi Direct devices negotiate when they first connect to determine which device shall act as an access point. Automated setup With the increase in the number and type of devices attaching to Wi-Fi systems, the basic model of a simple router with smart computers became increasingly strained. At the same time, the increasing sophistication of the hot spots presented setup problems for the users. To address these problems, there have been numerous attempts to simplify certain aspects of the setup task. A common example is the Wi-Fi Protected Setup system included in most access points built since 2007 when the standard was introduced.\\"Wi-Fi Protected Setup\\", Wi-Fi Alliance Knowledge base Wi-Fi Protected Setup allows access points to be set up simply by entering a PIN or other identification into a connection screen, or in some cases, simply by pressing a button. The Protected Setup system uses this information to send data to a computer, handing it the information needed to complete the network setup and connect to the Internet. From the user's point of view, a single click replaces the multi-step, jargon-filled setup experience formerly required. While the Protected Setup model works as intended, it was intended only to simplify the connection between the access point and the devices that would make use of its services, primarily accessing the Internet. It provides little help within a network - finding and setting up printer access from a computer for instance. To address those roles, a number of different protocols have developed, including Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS), and Zero Configuration Networking (ZeroConf). These protocols allow devices to seek out other devices within the network, query their capabilities, and provide some level of automatic setup. Wi-Fi Wi- Fi Direct has become a standard feature in smart phones and portable media players, and in feature phones as well.Glenn Fleishman, \\"Broadcom squeezes 11n, Bluetooth, FM into new, cheap chip\\", Ars Technica, 8 December 2008 The process of adding Wi-Fi to smaller devices has accelerated, and it is now possible to find printers, cameras, scanners, and many other common devices with Wi-Fi in addition to other connections, like USB. The widespread adoption of Wi-Fi in new classes of smaller devices made the need for ad hoc networking much more important. Even without a central Wi-Fi hub or router, it would be useful for a laptop computer to be able to wirelessly connect to a local printer. Although the ad hoc mode was created to address this sort of need, the lack of additional information for discovery makes it difficult to use in practice.Eric Griffith, \\"New 'Wi-Fi Direct' Spec Revamps Device Networks\\", PCMag.com, 14 October 2009Olga Kharif, \\"Wi-Fi Is About to Get a Whole Lot Easier\\", BusinessWeek, 14 October 2009 Although systems like UPnP and Bonjour provide many of the needed capabilities and are included in some devices, a single widely supported standard was lacking, and support within existing devices was far from universal. A guest using their smart phone would likely be able to find a hotspot and connect to the Internet with ease, perhaps using Protected Setup to do so. But, the same device would find that streaming music to a computer or printing a file might be difficult, or simply not supported between differing brands of hardware. Wi-Fi Direct can provide a wireless connection to peripherals. Wireless mice, keyboards, remote controls, headsets, speakers, displays, and many other functions can be implemented with Wi-Fi Direct. This has begun with Wi-Fi mouse products, and Wi-Fi Direct remote controls that were shipping circa November 2012. File sharing applications such as SHAREit on Android and BlackBerry 10 devices could use Wi-Fi Direct, with most Android version 4.1 (Jellybean), introduced in July 2012, and BlackBerry 10.2 supported. Android version 4.2 (Jellybean) included further refinements to Wi-Fi Direct including persistent permissions enabling two-way transfer of data between multiple devices. The Miracast standard for the wireless connection of devices to displays is based on Wi-Fi direct. Technical description Wi-Fi Direct essentially embeds a software access point (\\"Soft AP\\"), into any device that must support Direct. The soft AP provides a version of Wi-Fi Protected Setup with its push-button or PIN-based setup. When a device enters the range of the Wi-Fi Direct host, it can connect to it, and then gather setup information using a Protected Setup-style transfer. Connection and setup is so simplified that it may replace Bluetooth in some situations.Chris Foresman, \\"Wi-Fi Direct protocol to ease peer-to-peer WiFi connections\\", Ars Technica, 14 October 2009 Soft APs can be as simple or as complex as the role requires. A digital picture frame might provide only the most basic services needed to allow digital cameras to connect and upload images. A smart phone that allows data tethering might run a more complex soft AP that adds the ability to bridge to the Internet. The standard also includes WPA2 security and features to control access within corporate networks. Wi-Fi Direct-certified devices can connect one-to-one or one-to-many and not all connected products need to be Wi-Fi Direct-certified. One Wi-Fi Direct enabled device can connect to legacy Wi-Fi certified devices. The Wi-Fi Direct certification program is developed and administered by the Wi-Fi Alliance, the industry group that owns the \\"Wi-Fi\\" trademark. The specification is available for purchase from the Wi-Fi Alliance. Commercialization  Laptops  Intel included Wi-Fi Direct on the Centrino 2 platform, in its My WiFi technology by 2008. Wi-Fi Direct devices can connect to a notebook computer that plays the role of a software Access Point (AP). The notebook computer can then provide Internet access to the Wi-Fi Direct-enabled devices without a Wi- Fi AP. Marvell Technology Group, Atheros, Broadcom, Intel, Ralink, and Realtek announced their first products in October 2010. Redpine Signals's chipset was Wi-Fi Direct certified in November of the same year.  Mobile devices  Android. Google announced Wi-Fi Direct support in Android 4.0 in October 2011. While some Android 2.3 devices like Samsung Galaxy S II have had this feature through proprietary operating system extensions developed by OEMs, the Galaxy Nexus (released November 2011) was the first Android device to ship with Google's implementation of this feature and an API for developers. Ozmo Devices, which developed integrated circuits (chips) designed for Wi-Fi Direct, was acquired by Atmel in 2012. Wi-Fi Direct became available with the Blackberry 10.2 upgrade. As of March 2016, no iPhone device implements Wi-Fi Direct; instead, iOS has its own proprietary feature, namely Apple's MultipeerConnectivity. This protocol and others are used in the feature AirDrop, used to transfer large files between Apple devices using a similar (but proprietary) technology to Wi-Fi Direct.  Game consoles  The Xbox One, released in 2013, supports Wi-Fi Direct. NVIDIA's SHIELD controller uses Wi-Fi Direct to connect to compatible devices. NVIDIA claims a reduction in latency and increase in throughput over competing Bluetooth controllers.  Televisions  In March 2016 Sony, LG, Philips and X.VISION have implemented Wi-Fi Direct on some of their televisions.

The holiest local Muslim site, it is located some 5 km north-east from the centre of Kashgar, in Haohan Village ( Hào Hǎn Cūn; Ayziret in Uyghur),Display board at the site which has is also known as Yaghdu., page 75. The shrine is heavily patronized by sightseers. History The mazar (mausoleum) was initially built in ca. 1640 as the tomb of Muhammad Yūsuf, a Central Asian Naqshbandi Sufi master who had come to the Altishahr region (present-day Southern Xinjiang) in the early 17th century and possibly was also active in spreading Sufism in China proper.Due to scanty and imprecise documentary evidence, the late career of Muhammad Yūsuf and the date of his death remain uncertain. According to Joseph Fletcher's research, Muhammad Yūsuf had worked among Hui and Salar people in present-day Gansu and Qinghai provinces in the mid-17th century, then returned to Altishahr and died there in 1653, poisoned by his rivals. On the other hand, the dean of Hui studies in China, Ma Tong, thought that Muhammad Yūsuf died in 1622, and all preaching in Qinghai and Gansu was done by his son Afāq Khoja. ( Lipman's source is: Joseph Fletcher, \\"The Naqshbandiya in Northwest China\\", in ) Later, Muhammad Yūsuf's more famous son and successor, Afāq Khoja, was buried there as well in 1694. As believed, the tiled mausoleum contains the tombs of five generations of the Afāqi family, providing resting places for 72 of its members. The monument is also known as the Fragrant Concubine's tomb, as it is the burial place of one of Afaq Khoja's descendants, Iparhan, who is believed to be the legendary Fragrant Concubine. She was the wife of a rogue leader who was captured by the Qianlong Emperor's troops and was taken to Beijing to be the emperor's imperial concubine. Refusing to serve him, a Uyghur tale said she was forced to commit suicide or was murdered by the Emperor's mother. Description The mausoleum is perhaps the finest example of Islamic architecture in Xinjiang. A large dome of 17 m is at the center surrounded by four corner minarets with stripes and arabesque floral patterns. Each of the windows of the minarets are in a different geometric pattern while the tops have turrets with an inverted lotus dome and scalloped edges. The entrance to the mausoleum is a majestic facade and a tiled iwan-niche style typical of Central Asian mosques. The tombs are decorated with blue glazed tiles and draped in colorful silks. Inside the tomb hall is the Casket of Iparhan which supposedly carried her from Beijing. There is a mausoleum, four prayer halls which are supported by wooden beams with muqarnas on the capitals, a lecture hall and a cemetery which is still in use by the Ugyhur population and has distinctive mud and brick tombs. A gateway also has blue glazed tiles and there is a pond in the courtyard for people to cleanse before entering. \\"This was the famous shrine, and we were invited to step inside, where we saw a crowded mass of bluetiled tombs, that of the Saint-King being draped with red and white cloths. There were numbers of flags and banners before the tombs, and on one side was a palanquin in which a great-grandson of Apak had travelled to and from Peking. While there he had married his daughter to a Chinaman, and at the date of our visit a Celestial had arrived in Kashgar accompanied by a band of relatives, to demand his share of the great wealth of the shrine. His credentials were unexceptionable, and during a century and a half his ancestors had been given pensions by the Chinese Government; but owing to the revolution these subsidies had been stopped. Hence his appearance, which was causing much perturbation among the managers of the shrine funds.\\" - Sir Percy Sykes and Ella Sykes.

Background From 1878 Valentin Zubiaurre worked at the Madrid Royal Conservatory as a composer of audition pieces for potential members of the school. He had experience in this form of composition from his duties at the Chapel Royal, where he composed audition pieces for most instruments, as well as religious music.Brass Wind Publication 4107PA The Pieza De Cornetin para oposiciónes is his piece for the trumpet, and was probably used as a setpiece for final examinations in the conservatoire.Musicroom.com Description The beginning of the piece's andante movement The piece is divided into two movements, marked andante and allegretto respectively. The piano accompaniment (and the piece itself) is written in B major, but the trumpet part is transposed into C major (the trumpet is a B key instrument). Only the trumpet part will be discussed here. The andante is written in 3/4 time, and was written to bring out some of the smooth and tranquil sounds of the trumpet. For examination purposes it was designed to show off the performer's ability to play a slow melody with a good sound and sensitive phrasing. The andante finishes with a diminuendo-ing long pause, and then moves into the 6/8 allegretto. This section demands a flamboyant and ostentatious playing style with quick tonguing. It is written for the more exuberant side of the trumpet's personality. The piece as a whole is written in a light Spanish style, very much like Bizet's opera Carmen.

The village straddles an unclassified road leading from the main A1 highway at .  History  There is believed to have been settlement in the area for over 1,500 years, and Spott is the site of many finds from the time of the Romans occupation of southern Scotland. An Anglian homestead is located at nearby Doon Hill. Spott holds the dubious distinction of playing host to the last executions of the Scottish witch-hunts of the 17th and 18th centuries, when several alleged witches were executed at Spott Loan in October 1705. The first Battle of Dunbar in 1296, took place less than a mile from Spott. Before the second Battle of Dunbar in 1650, the Scots army, which vastly outnumbered Oliver Cromwell's army, camped at Doon Hill, just to the east of Spott, before leaving the high ground to meet Cromwell and defeat.Ordnance Gazetteer for Scotland The war memorial in Spott dates from 1920 and was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer The Witches' Stone, by the road to the south-west of the village  Spott House  Spott House has served as home to the proprietors of Spott since the 13th century. Elias de Spott swore fealty to King Edward I of England at Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1296. Over the centuries the estate has changed hands on several occasions and many eminent Haddingtonshire families – the Humes, Douglasses, Murrays and the Hays – have held the lands of Spott. The old Hume laird of Spott was killed in the fields at harvest time in September 1591 by the Homes of Ayton in a feud. His murderers fled to England.Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 572, 575, 595. His successor, Sir George Home of Spott entertained James VI with a banquet at Spott in October 1600.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 722. Spott House was originally a tower house, constructed in 1640, the family home of the Hays of Yester. It is reputed to have housed Oliver Cromwell during the Battle of Dunbar (1650). In 1830, it was purchased by James Sprot, who had the house remodelled by William Burn, the pioneer of the Scots Baronial style. The estate remained in the Sprot family until 1947, when it was sold to Sir James Hope. It was eventually sold to the Lawrie family, who sold it to the Danish-born Lars Foghsgaard in 2000.Andrew Cusack: The Spott Estate, Dunbar http://www.andrewcusack.com/2010/11/28/spott-estate-dunbar/ Following Foghsgaard's return to Denmark the estate was put up for sale in 2010, but after three years with no purchaser, was broken up into smaller lots of land or buildings.  Church  The origins of the church are somewhat vague, but it is certain there was a church here before the Reformation, when Spott Kirk was a prebendary of the Collegiate Church of Dunbar. Major repairs were carried out on the church in 1790 and again the following century giving its present cruciform shape. One arm of the church is an ancient burial vault. In 1570 the minister, John Kelloe, strangled his wife in the manse before delivering 'a more than usually eloquent sermon'. He was executed on October 4 at Edinburgh at the Gallow Lee on Leith Walk for the crime. Patrick Simson, the Greek language expert, whose father was minister in Dunbar, preached here.

Apparently, the National Register information submitted in 1984 by Glenn Dorroh, a previous owner, correctly identifies this as the house of Dr. Brown Young (1823-1893), a fact confirmed by Jessamine county maps from 1861 and 1877 which identify the house as belonging to \\"Dr. B. Young.\\" But Dorroh's file goes on to claim: \\"Brown Young's father John was a Revolutionary War soldier and his son was the historian Col. Bennett H. Young.\\" Both of these claims are false. Bennett H. Young himself would say so as he wrote A History of Jessamine County KY (1898), which he dedicated to his father. Bennett Young identifies his father as Robert Young, whom he describes as a native of Fayette County, KY, who set up shop as a hatter (hat maker) in Nicholasville, KY (Jessamine County) from 1825 to 1848. In 1848 Robert sold the store and bought a farm. The Jessamine County Atlas of 1877 shows that the farm of R. Young was located on Kentucky Route 29 just west of what is now the Nicholasville by-pass. The home no longer stands and is the site of a subdivision, but its location is included on C. N. Bunch's map of Jessamine County Historical Homes (2003). Since Bennett would have been 6 years old by the time his father bought the farm, he clearly was not born there either; he probably was born in the town of Nicholasville in the home adjacent to his father's hat shop. The house pictured here (not actually on Route 29 but off it on the Lexington Road to Wilmore, KY, far further to the southwest) is indeed the former house of Dr. Brown Young. He was the son of Dr. Archibald and Martha Young, who lived in the home adjacent to the north. Archibald was apparently either the brother or the cousin of Robert Young (there was more than one), and both of them were among the several sons of John Young, who had been a revolutionary War soldier. Brown Young married Emline Drake, whose family owned the property adjacent to the south of the B. Young house. Brown and Emline had a daughter, Adelia (b. 1846), who married a Leonard Willis. According to the Lamont Family DNA study, the Youngs may also have had a son named Samuel (b. 1849), but there is no mention of this son in the biographical sketch of Dr. Brown Young in Kentucky: A History of the State (Battle, et al., 1887), so he may have died in infancy or childhood. The 150 acres is now a working Angus farm named Sycamore Hill in reference to the Sycamore trees that line the driveway. The property is owned by the Ashbrook family although they do not occupy the main house. It is rented as a single family home. The property was placed on the United States National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1984. Architecture The Young House was supposedly built between 1814 and 1820, and is decorated in the Italianate style. The two-story, nine-room house has 18 -inch-thick brick exterior walls and is now a total of approximately 3600 square feet in size. It has wide-plank, ash wood flooring. But if this date is correct, then it could not have been built by Brown Young himself, as he was born in 1823. The National Register only claims this home was built in the mid-19th century.

Architecture The main structures of St. Bartholomew's are all modernist (or International style) in design. Architectural buffs have granted the main church building some attention, one blogger calling it a \\"nice setting\\",wefworld.blogspot.com, accessed January 8, 2014. and another calling attention to the \\"bluer\\" ceiling of its nave.architecturetourist.blogspot.com, accessed January 8, 2014. History 1950s and 1960s In the early 1950s, many people were moving into DeKalb County, especially in the vicinity of W. D. Thomson School, the area now known as Toco Hill. St. Bartholomew's Church originated when a group of Episcopalians recognized the need for a church in this rapidly growing community. With the permission of the Bishop of Atlanta, the Rt. Rev. Randolph Claiborne, these Episcopalians met in December 1953, to start the process. On February 24, 1954, St. Bartholomew's officially became an \\"organized mission of the Protestant Episcopal Church,\\" with the Rev. Harry Tisdale (then Rector of Holy Trinity in Decatur) as priest-in-charge. In March of that same year, the mission purchased property on LaVista Road and soon bought a former barracks building and moved it onto the property. This building served as church, parish house, Sunday School, kitchen, office and nursery. Later, it housed Nicholas House for homeless families. In January 1955, when the Rev. Austin Ford began his ministry, the mission's original six families had grown to fifty. One of the original organizers was George A. Craig, a grad student/employee of Georgia Tech.personal experience On January 27, 1957, St. Bartholomew's achieved full recognition as a parish. With communicants exceeding 250, construction began on a new church building (now the Parish Hall). In 1960, the 700 communicants spun off another parish, St. Bede's. In 1967, Fr. Ford left to establish Emmaus House, a ministry in the inner city.Cultivating Hope: For twenty-eight years, alumnus Austin Ford has led a ministry of social change in downtown Atlanta 1970s The Rev. Charles Hackett served as rector until 1971, when he resigned to continue his studies and start the Anglican Studies program at Emory University's Candler School of Theology.Anglican Studies Program at the Candler School of Theology of Emory University In 1972, the Rev. Harwood (\\"Woody\\") Bartlett became the rector, and during his tenure, the parish joined several other area churches in outreach efforts focused on the inner city, including programs at several housing projects. The Olde English Festival began in 1978, in an effort to raise funds for a new organ. The fun and profits of the Festival led to its continuation for 25 years. After the first few years, all proceeds went to causes outside the parish. Also in 1978, the parish once again expanded its facilities to create offices, a music department, and more classrooms. 1980s In 1982, Fr. Bartlett left to become the director of the Episcopal Charities Foundation. During the interim period between rectors, the parish opened a family shelter in Sunday school rooms in response to increasing homelessness in the community. The Rev. Chester (Chet) Grey became rector in that same year. He played a major role in the establishment of Jerusalem House, a residence for those affected by AIDS. In 1988, Project Open Hand began using the kitchen facilities at St. Bartholomew's to prepare meals for 14 people with AIDS. The organization, which expanded its mission in 2000 to serve those living with virtually any chronic illness, homebound seniors and at-risk youth, now occupies a new, much larger facility, where it prepares over 5,000 meals each day for thousands of people across 18 Georgia counties. Now called Open Hand Atlanta, the organization also provides much-needed nutrition education throughout the state, and Market Baskets, which include fresh fruit and vegetables, for clients now able to prepare meals themselves. 1990s The St. Joseph of Arimathea garden opened in 1992, and the Emmanuel Center for Pastoral Counseling also opened during this period. In 1993, Fr. Grey left to assume the role of Dean of Trinity Cathedral in Trenton, New Jersey, as another major building program was underway. In 1994, the Rev. Stacy Sauls became the rector and oversaw the construction that was underway. In 1995, the construction of a new worship space was completed, and the old church became the parish hall and chapel. Fr. Sauls also supervised the purchase of a new organ. The Toco Hill Community Ministry was formed to provide financial help for families in trouble. The parish converted the former rectory into a meeting place, now known as the Amerson House. During these years, the music program grew in strength, size, and quality with directors Randolph James and Brad Hughley. 2000s Stacy Sauls left in 2000, upon his election as the Bishop of Lexington. In the interregnum, the parish was led by the Rev. Jim Curtis. In 2002, the Rev. Wm. McCord (\\"Mac\\") Thigpen III, became the sixth (and first openly gay) rector of St. Bartholomew's. He has presided over the completion of the Rosales organ and a full renovation of the Amerson House (former rectory). He has brought a renewed vision of hospitality to St. Bartholomew's as well as a joyful celebration of the parish's fifty-year history.

He appeared as a young boy on local television on Morris B. Sach's Amateur Hour singing and playing the accordion. He appeared on an interview show, Ernie Simon's Curbstone Cut-up. He sang his hit record \\"Were Wolf\\" on disc-jockey Jim Lounsbury's TV show in Chicago. He went on to promote local bands with his weekly dances at local ballrooms including the Aragon Ballroom, Madura's Danceland and The Holiday Ballroom with owner and collaborator Dan Belloc of big band fame (Billy May Orchestra). He recorded and produced over 200 records with various recording artists. He fronted a local group, The Gem- tones, whose saxophone player, Harry Manfredini, became a movie musical score arranger for the \\"Friday the 13th\\" movies. He then turned to managing and promoting local teen bands (garage-bands in the early 60s). His most famous clients were The Buckinghams and the all-girl group The Daughters of Eve. He also managed Thee Prophets, from Wisconsin and Mickey & Larry and the Exciters from Boston. He managed The Delights, in Chicago. He worked for the Willard Alexander Booking Agency with agent Herb Gronauer, who now promotes celebrities in Palm Springs, California. He also worked for the CASK Attractions agency. As a young band manager Bonafede promoted many young teens in a new phenomenon – the garage band. One of these groups included The Fabulous Centuries. The Centuries consisted of Nick Fortuna, Curtis Bachman, Carl Giammarese and Jerry Elarde. Carl Bonafede first crossed paths with Phil Orsi in 1964 when Phil was fronting Phil Orsi and the Little Kings at the Vogue Ballroom in Chicago.Screaming Wildman: Carl Bonafede, Joel Bierig: 9781539420965: Amazon.com: Books\\". www.amazon.com.page 108 Retrieved 2017-09-14 Another group with great vocal harmonies was known as The Pulsations. John Poulos, Dennis Miccolis, George LeGros and Dennis Tufano were members of The Pulsations. These two groups merged to form The Buckinghams. One day, Sheldon Cooper, an executive at WGN-TV, witnessed a promotion of Carl's outside Lane Tech High School across the street from WGN-TV's studios. Carl's discussion with Cooper led to The Pulsations entering and winning a competition to appear for 13 weeks on The All-Time Hits, Chicago's first locally produced TV program broadcast in color, featuring a variety of musical guests. By the end of the 13-week run, the Pulsations/Fabulous Centuries became The Buckinghams. He was on hand at the Chess Records studios in Chicago, Illinois to record \\"Kind of a Drag\\" with the Buckinghams co-producer 'Dan Belloc and arranger Frank Tesinsky. Jim Holvay of the local Chicago group The Mob was the composer of \\"Kind of a Drag\\". Present day As of 2017, Carl Bonafede aka \\"The Screaming Wildman\\" (a nickname given to him by a priest who witnessed Carl running a local parish teenage dance) still lives and works in Chicago in the Lincoln Park area, close to the lakefront.

It consists of crystalline rocks that were, before the formation of the Alps, part of the upper crust of the southern margin of the European continent (the northern margin of the Alpine Tethys Ocean). Position and outcrops The Gotthard nappe is found south of its larger neighbour, the Aarmassif. The two crystalline zones are separated by a thin zone of metamorphosed and strongly deformed sedimentary cover rocks of the Tethys sea. In the south, the Simano and Adula nappes lie on top of the Gotthard nappe. The Gotthard nappe crops out in an elongated strip through the Central Alps. This outcrop begins west of the mountain ridge between the Binntal and the Goms (the valley of the Rhone) east of Brig. It stays south of the Goms and south of the Furka Pass, Andermatt, north of Airolo in the Valle Leventina, south of the Oberalp Pass, Disentis and ends south of the eastern part of the Surselva (the valley of the Vorderrhein). Geology The outcrop can be divided into three parts or zones: a central core of Ordovician orthogneiss, called the Streifengneis (\\"striped gneiss\\"); flanked on both sides by zones of mica schist or paragneiss. The northern paragneiss zone contains lenses of various lithologies, such as calcareous schists, amphibolite, eclogite, peridotite (mostly thoroughly serpentinized) and gabbro. The southern paragneiss zone contains characteristic hornblende-garnet schists called Garbenschiefer, part of the Tremola series.Labhart (2005) The crystalline rocks of the Gotthard nappe carry strong traces of at least two older orogenies before the Alpine orogeny. The oldest phase, sometimes (erroneously) called \\"Caledonian\\", took place in the Ordovician. The paragneiss of the Gotthard nappe was once oceanic sediment, which was deformed into an accretionary wedge during this orogeny. The gabbros and peridotites, now lenses in the paragneiss, probably represent pieces of oceanic crust underneath these sediments, that were incorporated into the Ordovician accretionary wedge. The eclogite metamorphism has been dated at about 470 Ma (million years ago). In the late stages of the Ordovician orogenic phase, granitoid magma bodies intruded, especially granite. During the Hercynian orogeny, about 320 Ma, all of these units were strongly deformed. Today, the Ordovician intrusives form the Streifengneis of the central zone. The Hercynian orogeny ended with another phase of granitoid intrusions. Four Hercynian intrusive bodies are found in the current outcrop of the Gotthard nappe: the Rotondo granite north of the Val Bedretto, the Fibbia and Gamsboden granites close to the Gotthard Pass and the Cristallina granite around the Lukmanier Pass. These intrusions have ages between 305 and 290 Ma. See also *Aarmassif *Geology of the Alps References *; 2005: Geologie der Schweiz, h.e.p. verlag ag, Ott Verlag, 7. Auflage, Bern.

Current passes through the junction via the process of quantum tunneling. The STJ is a type of Josephson junction, though not all the properties of the STJ are described by the Josephson effect. These devices have a wide range of applications, including high-sensitivity detectors of electromagnetic radiation, magnetometers, high speed digital circuit elements, and quantum computing circuits. Quantum tunneling Illustration of a thin-film superconducting tunnel junction (STJ). The superconducting material is light blue, the insulating tunnel barrier is black, and the substrate is green. Energy diagram of a superconducting tunnel junction. The vertical axis is energy, and the horizontal axis shows the density of states. Cooper pairs exist at the Fermi energy, indicated by the dashed lines. A bias voltage V is applied across the junction, shifting the Fermi energies of the two superconductors relative to each other by an energy eV, where e is the electron charge. Quasiparticle states exist for energies greater than Δ from the Fermi energy, where Δ is the superconducting energy gap. Green and blue indicate empty and filled quasiparticle states, respectively, at zero temperature. Sketch of the current-voltage (I-V) curve of a superconducting tunnel junction. The Cooper pair tunneling current is seen at V = 0, while the quasiparticle tunneling current is seen for V > 2Δ/e and V < -2Δ/e. All currents flowing through the STJ pass through the insulating layer via the process of quantum tunneling. There are two components to the tunneling current. The first is from the tunneling of Cooper pairs. This supercurrent is described by the ac and dc Josephson relations, first predicted by Brian David Josephson in 1962.B. D. Josephson, \\"Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling,\\" Physics Letters 1, 251 (1962), For this prediction, Josephson received the Nobel prize in physics in 1973. The second is the quasiparticle current, which, in the limit of zero temperature, arises when the energy from the bias voltage eV exceeds twice the value of superconducting energy gap Δ. At finite temperature, a small quasiparticle tunneling current — called the subgap current — is present even for voltages less than twice the energy gap due to the thermal promotion of quasiparticles above the gap. If the STJ is irradiated with photons of frequency f, the dc current-voltage curve will exhibit both Shapiro steps and steps due to photon-assisted tunneling. Shapiro steps arise from the response of the supercurrent and occur at voltages equal to nhf/(2e), where h is Planck's constant, e is the electron charge, and n is an integer.S. Shapiro, \\"Josephson currents in superconducting tunneling: The effect of microwaves and other observations\\" Physical Review Letters 11, 80 (1963), Photon-assisted tunneling arises from the response of the quasiparticles and gives rise to steps displaced in voltage by nhf/e relative to the gap voltage.M. Tinkham, Introduction to Superconductivity, 2nd edition, Dover Publications, 1996  Device fabrication  The device is typically fabricated by first depositing a thin film of a superconducting metal such as aluminum on an insulating substrate such as silicon. The deposition is performed inside a vacuum chamber. Oxygen gas is then introduced into the chamber, resulting in the formation of an insulating layer of aluminum oxide (Al_{2}O_{3}) with a typical thickness of several nanometers. After the vacuum is restored, an overlapping layer of superconducting metal is deposited, completing the STJ. To create a well-defined overlap region, a procedure known as the Niemeyer- Dolan technique is commonly used. This technique uses a suspended bridge of resist with a double-angle deposition to define the junction. Aluminum is widely used for making superconducting tunnel junctions because of its unique ability to form a very thin (2-3 nm) insulating oxide layer with no defects that short-circuit the insulating layer. The superconducting critical temperature of aluminum is approximately 1.2 kelvin (K). For many applications, it is convenient to have a device that is superconducting at a higher temperature, in particular at a temperature above the boiling point of liquid helium, which is 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. One approach to achieving this is to use niobium, which has a superconducting critical temperature in bulk form of 9.3 K. Niobium, however, does not form an oxide that is suitable for making tunnel junctions. To form an insulating oxide, the first layer of niobium can be coated with a very thin layer (approximately 5 nm) of aluminum, which is then oxidized to form a high quality aluminum oxide tunnel barrier before the final layer of niobium is deposited. The thin aluminum layer is proximitized by the thicker niobium, and the resulting device has a superconducting critical temperature above 4.2 K.A. A. Joseph, J. Sese, J. Flokstra, & H. G. Kerkhoff, \\"Structural testing of the HYPRES niobium process,\\" IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, 15, 106 (2005), Early work used lead-lead oxide-lead tunnel junctions.G. J. Dolan, T. G. Phillips, and D. P. Woody, \\"Low‐noise 115‐GHz mixing in superconducting oxide‐barrier tunnel junctions,\\" Applied Physics Letters 34, 347 (1979), Lead has a superconducting critical temperature of 7.2 K in bulk form, but lead oxide tends to develop defects (sometimes called pinhole defects) that short- circuit the tunnel barrier when the device is thermally cycled between cryogenic temperatures and room temperature, and as result lead is no longer widely used to make STJs. Applications Radio astronomy STJs are the most sensitive heterodyne receivers in the 100 GHz to 1000 GHz frequency range, and hence are used for radio astronomy at these frequencies.J. Zmuidzinas and P. L. Richards, \\"Superconducting detectors and mixers for millimeter and submillimeter astrophysics,\\" Proceedings of the IEEE 92, 1597 (2004), In this application, the STJ is dc biased at a voltage just below the gap voltage (|V= 2\\\\Delta /e). A high frequency signal from an astronomical object of interest is focused onto the STJ, along with a local oscillator source. Photons absorbed by the STJ allow quasiparticles to tunnel via the process of photon-assisted tunneling. This photon-assisted tunneling changes the current-voltage curve, creating a nonlinearity that produces an output at the difference frequency of the astronomical signal and the local oscillator. This output is a frequency down-converted version of the astronomical signal.M. J. Wengler, \\"Submillimeter-wave detection with superconducting tunnel diodes,\\" Proceedings of the IEEE 80, 1810 (1992), These receivers are so sensitive that an accurate description of the device performance must take into account the effects of quantum noise.J. R. Tucker, \\"Quantum limited detection in tunnel junction mixers,\\" IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics 15, 1234 (1979), Single-photon detection In addition to heterodyne detection, STJs can also be used as direct detectors. In this application, the STJ is biased with a dc voltage less than the gap voltage. A photon absorbed in the superconductor breaks Cooper pairs and creates quasiparticles. The quasiparticles tunnel across the junction in the direction of the applied voltage, and the resulting tunneling current is proportional to the photon energy. STJ devices have been employed as single-photon detectors for photon frequencies ranging from X-rays to the infrared.STJ detectors from the European Space Agency, accessed 8-17-11 SQUIDs The superconducting quantum interference device or SQUID is based on a superconducting loop containing Josephson junctions. SQUIDs are the world's most sensitive magnetometers, capable of measuring a single magnetic flux quantum. Quantum computing Superconducting quantum computing utilizes STJ-based circuits, including charge qubits, flux qubits and phase qubits.

The club was founded in spring 2008 as part of the planned merger of the football divisions of the two sports clubs Lüneburger SK and Lüneburger SV.  History  The former Oberliga team, Lüneburger SK, got into financial difficulties after its relegation from Regional League North (Regionalliga Nord) in 2001, which eventually led in 2002 to the initiation of insolvency proceedings. To resolve the club's debts its president, Manfred Harder, looked for suitable partners. After three months of negotiations he announced in early 2008 with the committee of the district league team, Lüneburger SV, the foundation of a new club, FC Hansa Lüneburg. In the 2008–09 season the new club merged the football divisions of both clubs fully. FC Hansa Lüneburg took over the position held by Lüneburger SK in the Lower Saxony League (Niedersachsenliga) and its right to participate in the first main round of the 2008–09 DFB-Pokal, playing VfB Stuttgart (result 0–5). In the Lower Saxony League the club achieved 4th place in its first season. In the 2013–14 season of the Niedersachsenliga, Lüneburg SK Hansa was the champion and have thus played since the 2014–15 season again in the 4th league, the Regionalliga Nord. In the 2017–18 season, LSK again played in the DFB-Pokal. The club were beaten in the first main round, with a 1–3 defeat against Bundesliga side Mainz 05, however midfielder Felix Vobejda scored the first goal for the club in the cup's history. The first team has been using the Heinrich-Langeloh-Platz (shared with TSV Bardowick) since 2014, after Wilschenbruch stadium was demolished following its sale to make way for new residential homes. Current squad  Honours  The club's honours: * Niedersachsenliga ** Champions: 2014  Name  Team manager, Christos Dovas, and the president of Lüneburger SK, Manfred Harder, chose the name of the newly founded football club, FC Hansa Lüneburg.

G. Corfield Ltd, England in May 1953 as the first and original model from this source. The camera resembles the Leica Standard and qualifies fully as a Leica copy. However, film loading is by way of a removable back, and it provides through the lens visual focusing using an inverted periscope to be lowered into the light path between the lens and the film, utilising the single-lens reflex principle, showing a small section from the lower middle of the full image. The Periflex became quite popular in Britain and several improved models were introduced during the ensuing years until their demise in the early 1960s. Description The body is made of black painted metal alloy castings, while the top and base- plates are of black anodised stamped aluminium with delicate engravings. The covering material of the first two hundred units or so were brown pigskin, while all later ones were finished in black leather cloth because the pig skin stained easily. Also for this reason, whenever a camera was returned to the Wolverhampton works for service, the brown covering would be replaced without charge, if the owner so desired. The knobs and controls on the top-plate are turned and milled from solid aluminium. Engraved numerals and arrows in the top plate indicate their respective function and mode of operation. A semiautomatic decrementing frame-counter is built into the wind-on knob visible through a small cutaway window in the knob. A small button next to it, which also doubles as a film rewind release, allows the wind-on knob to be turned back and forth to set the frame counter to the number of frames remaining on the loaded film. The optical viewfinder, with individual eyesight adjustment, is mounted in an accessory shoe slightly offset to the left-hand side on the top plate. It matches the field-of-view of the standard 50mm camera lens. It may be replaced by separately available ones matching the field of view of interchangeable lenses of the photographer's choice. The built-in focusing aide is situated centrally on the top plate. It is lowered manually into the light pass behind the camera lens and held in position against spring tension by pushing a small knob on the side of the periscope to its down position. The motive is shown magnified on a focusing screen inside the periscope, making it particularly useful for macro and copy work. The cloth focal-plane shutter provides speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The shutter release button is situated on the right-hand camera front externally threaded for Leica cable release. The shutter control is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter speed selector. A standard coaxial flash synchronising socket is situated at the front of the camera, below the shutter release button. The camera back is removable for changing film. A milled button next to the tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film- pressure plate of thick glass is mounted on a piece of rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.. No isbn number available The Periflex was sold with a Corfield England Lumar f=50mm 1:3.5 standard lens in a bright aluminium barrel. Corfield had the British Optical Lens Company calculate the three element Cook design which proved to be quite satisfactory, and subsequently became the manufacturer and supplier of the coated glass elements, while Corfield turned, cut and milled the barrels, and completed the lenses in their premises. The original Periflex has the engravings directly in the black anodised aluminium top and base plates. The first few hundred cameras were covered in brown pigskin, which proved difficult to mount in production without getting glue stains on it, so it was soon changed to black leather. Some time after that the engraving of the top plate was dropped and instead an engraved disc was placed under the shutter speed dial. \\"Corfield / Periflex / England\\" was engraved on the front of the periscope housing. After about one and a half year of manufacture, the top and base plate finish were changed to bright anodised aluminium. All later standard models were finished in bright aluminium and black leather. * 1st version - black body, brown pigskin cover, aluminium lens barrel * 2nd version - black body, black leatherette cover, aluminium lens barrel * 3rd version - black body, black leatherette cover, engravings moved to bright aluminium parts * 4th version - chrome body, black leatherette cover, black leather strips on lens. The Periflex was replaced by the largely reworked Periflex 3 in 1957, and a year later complemented by the economy model Periflex 2.

Cullen, 1903–1946, page 4, link from Google books In 1928 and 29 he had several poems published in The New Yorker magazine. In 1952 he wrote a children's book Kay Kay Comes Home: a Fable of Enthusiasm in the form of a Russian folktale. The book was selected by New York Times as one of the best illustrated children's books of 1952.Best illustrated books (listed as 1962) from New York Times In 1955 Samstag described strategies used to improve corporate public relations in the book The Engineering of Consent which was edited by Edward Bernays. Bernays defined public relations as \\"the attempt, by information, persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution\\".Bernays (1955) The Engineering of Consent, pp. 3–4 Samstag was a junior associate of Bernays at the time, and contributed a long chapter on \\"Strategy\\" which was noted as both enlightening and provocative. It illustrated with cases the variety of strategies in public relations. More notable was his willingness to air the controversial subject of ethics in the field. His chapter concluded, :It may be said that to take advantage of a man's credulity, to exploit his misapprehensions, to capitalize on his ignorance is morally reprehensible—and this may well be the case. [. . .] Where, then does the author of this chapter stand on these difficult and reproachful questions? I do not quite know—and I am neither contented nor arrogant in that unsatisfactory answer. But this should be said: a strategy is an instrument for winning. Samstag closes by discussing warfare and business as synonymous, suggesting generals and bosses \\"must make terms with their own consciences. I cannot help them there\\" (p. 137). In 1957 he wrote his own manual for promotion: Persuasion for Profit. In 1960 he was invited by the Minnesota Advertisers' Club to speak. He encouraged the advertisers to become generalists by reading widely so that they may better communicate with their markets. The speech was published by Vital Speeches of the Day. Samstag died of cancer in Manhattan in 1968 at 64 years of age. The Time magazine article marking his death said: > A recognized, often flamboyant practitioner of his trade, Samstag wrote a > number of successful books, including Bamboozled and The Uses of Ineptitude > and, while running his own agency after 1960, took ads in Manhattan > newspapers offering to teach anyone everything he knew about the advertising > and promotion business—for a fee of $10,000.

Early life Constance of Wrocław was born in 1227, the second child of Henry II the Pious and his wife Anna of Bohemia, the daughter of Ottokar I of Bohemia and Constance of Hungary. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Constance of Hungary. Constance and her siblings were brought up away from their parents at the monastery of Trzebnica, where they were cared for by their paternal grandmother Hedwig of Andechs. Hedwig (who was later canonized) greatly influenced the young Constance - she became pious. Later, Hedwig also influenced Constance' son, Leszek. She was expected to marry soon after coming of age at 12 years, and could do so according to canon law.K. Jasinski Pedigree Little Poland and Kuyavian Piast, Poznań – Wrocław 2001, p. 62 Earlier in K. Jasinski's Pedigree of the Silesian Piast dynasty. Volume I. The Piast and Legnica-Wrocław brzescy, Wrocław Scientific Society, Wrocław 1973, pointed out that as younger than Constance, Gertrude was born probably after 1220 Cf. K. Jasinski Pedigree of the Silesian Piast, Thu. I, ed. II, Kraków 2007, p. 120 In Table I / 2 at the end of the book: zap. 1221–1227. She married in 1239. At the time only her sister Gertrude was married, to Bolesław I of Masovia. Only one other sister, Elisabeth of Wrocław was to marry, her other sisters becoming Abbesses.In general, married daughters were given in order of seniority, the youngest offspring was sent for the priesthood. Gertrude, in 1233, married Bolesław I of Masovia, Elizabeth, in 1244, married Przemysł I of Greater Poland, while Agnieszka cysterką Trzebnicka was a Jadwiga who joined the Poor Clares monastery in Wrocław. Cf. K. Jasinski Pedigree of the Silesian Piast, Thu. I, ed. II, Kraków 2007, p. 120 Constance was more carefully educated than her future husband, Casimir I of Kuyavia, who was tutored by John Heron, who was later educated by Casimir's parents.  Marriage  In 1239 at Wrocław, Constance married Casimir I of Kuyavia, the second son of Konrad I, Duke of Masovia.SILESIA, Medieval Lands In literature there are two theories for the marriage. The first theory is that Constance's father, Henry, for political reasons wanted a strong alliance with his potential enemy, Konrad I. With Constance's sister Gertrude already married to Konrad's eldest son, her marriage would make a stronger alliance. The second theory states that Constance's father had internal and external state problems, whereby good relations with the Duke of Mazovia would help greatly, and the marriage of his daughter to the son of the Duke was intended as an effective way to strengthen cooperation.T. Žemaitija, The study divided Kingdom. Duke Leszek the Black, Warsaw 2000, p. 26 Henry filed a dowry for Constance's marriage to Casimir. This dowry and inheritance of Henry would later cause fighting between Casimir and Bolesław the Pious (1258–1262), ending in Bolesław gaining Greater Poland Bolesław the Pious reported claims to the land which the 1237 lost his father, Wladyslaw Odonic, while at war with Constance's father. Constance's husband, Casimir, was born between 1210 and 1213.K. Jasinski Pedigree Little Poland and Kuyavian Piast, Poznań – Wrocław 2001, p. 57-58. O. Balzer, Genealogy Piast, Kraków 1895, p. 292, put his birth at around 1211 He was the second son of Konrad I and Agafia of Rus. He reigned over Kuyavia from 1230 or 1231 after his brother and Gertrude's husband, Bolesław, died. Bolesław, instead of leaving his lands, including Masovia, to Casimir, as stipulated in Konrad's will, passed these to Casimir's younger brother, Siemowit I of Masovia. Casimir had been married once before, to Jadwiga, a Polish noblewoman whose origins are unknown.This view is D. Karczew's, included in the work On the origin of Hedwig, the first wife of Prince Casimir Kuyavia Konradowica[In] K. Zielinska-Melkowska (ed.), Central and Eastern Europe in politics Piast, Toruń, 1997. Speak for him: the same name of his wife Odonic, HedwigAnd the friendly relations between the prince and his father Casimir Wielkopolskie, Konrad Mazowiecki. Cf. K. Jasinski Pedigree Little Poland and Kuyavian Piast, Poznań – Wrocław 2001, p. 61-62. Casimir and Jadwiga had no children and Jadwiga died childless. Constance and Casimir had two children: #Leszek II the Black (1240-42 - 30 September 1288), Duke of the Fragmentation of Poland #Ziemomysł of Kuyavia (1241-45 - 29 October or 24 December 1287), Duke of Kuyavia Death The date of death for Constance is disputed. With regard to the year, she is last noted as a living person in a document dated 25 May 1252, whereas the first document indicating her death is from 3 May 1257. As far as the day and month, Nekrolog strzeleński reported that she died on the 21st of February, but, according to Nekrologu opactwa św. Wincentego we Wrocławiu (en: obituary from the Abbey of St. Vincent in Wrocław), her death occurred on the 23rd of February.O. Balzer, Genealogy Piast, Kraków 1895, p. 299, opted for the earlier date, as specified by the local source. He claimed that the obituary from Wrocław indicated a date two days later, as news of Constance's death arrived late to Silesia. According to him the two obituaries were independent of one another; K. Jasinski Pedigree of the Silesian Piast, Thu. I, ed. II, Kraków 2007, p. 120-121, recognized both dates as equally likely. According to him, the Wrocław obituary would have been able to keep the record from the Nekrolog strzeleński obituary, which allegedly took the initial information about the death of Constance. Neither obituary survives to the present day. The obituary from the Abbey of St. Vincent in Wrocław is known from a thirteenth-century manuscript, and the obituary from Nekrolog strzeleński with a later copy. Thus, she is considered to have died on 21 or 23 February between 1253 and 1257. Due to the fact that the only three mentions of her death in the documents of Casimir I were from 1257 (3 May, 16 September, and 10 November), it is considered highly likely that she died earlier that year. Constance's burial place is unknown. The document from 16 September 1257 was issued by her two sons and Casimir to the Bishop of Chełmno. Her sons wanted to have daily Mass celebrated for Constance's soul.

PECI designs and manages energy efficiency programs for utility providers, government organizations, and other clients. Some of the organizations PECI has worked with include the U.S. Department of Energy, Avista, Wal-mart, Southern California Edison, the Community Energy Project, Energy Trust of Oregon, Pacific Gas & Electric and the San Diego Natural History Museum. As energy consumption rises, governments and utility companies are looking for ways to meet demand without creating energy-generating infrastructure. Meanwhile, many businesses are looking to reduce overhead costs by lowering their energy consumption. PECI designs tactics that encourage commercial businesses and residential consumers to adopt energy-efficient technology and behaviors, and manages the programmatic framework to implement these tactics on an appropriate scale. On September 16, 2014, PECI announced that its current assets and contracts had been acquired by CLEAResult, a for-profit company that designs, markets and implements energy programs for utilities, businesses and residential energy customers., Ownership of the PECI name and brand remains with the PECI board of directors.  History  Originally called Portland Energy Conservation, Inc., PECI was created by the city of Portland in 1979 as a public agency tasked with carrying out private sector aspects of the Portland Energy Conservation Policy. In 1984, PECI was spun off from city government into a private, non-profit company with 12 employees. In 1990, PECI managed the Energy Edge program for the Administration. The intent of Energy Edge was to learn how energy-efficient lighting, refrigeration, and HVAC measures performed in commercial buildings. In addition to being PECI’s first commercial energy efficiency program, Energy Edge was a landmark event in the creation of building commissioning processes. PECI’s first energy efficiency program for residential consumers was the ENERGY STAR CFL program, which was launched in 1995 and operated throughout the Pacific Northwest. By 2002, PECI was focusing on program designs that could be more easily replicated for different markets. A program called EnergySmart Grocer provides no-cost energy audits to supermarkets, convenience stores, and restaurants. Based on the results of the audit, the business can elect to install energy efficient refrigeration, lighting, HVAC, and food service equipment. The cost of the installation is offset by financial incentives from the utility company, allowing businesses to see the benefits of energy- and cost-saving technology while minimizing the cost of the upfront investment. Since 2006, EnergySmart Grocer programs have saved 227 million kWh of electricity in the Pacific Northwest. Another replicable PECI program, AirCare Plus, was also created in 2002. The program trains HVAC contractors to offer no-cost diagnostic tune-ups to utility customers’ HVAC systems. Increasing the efficiency of HVAC equipment saves energy from what is typically a home or commercial building’s largest energy consumer. It also increases equipment life and reduces the building’s environmental impact. AirCare Plus programs have been launched across the Pacific Northwest and California, saving more than 91 million kWh of electricity. PECI opened two California offices in 2010, in Santa Ana and San Francisco. The same year, PECI won an $18.8 million contract from the California Energy Commission, funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to run a program called EnergySmart Jobs. The program was similar to EnergySmart Grocer, except that energy audits were performed by PECI-trained members of the California Conservation Corp, a work development program for men and women between the ages of 18 and 25. EnergySmart Jobs operated in California from 2010 to 2012 and saved more than 62 million kWh of electricity and created 265 job years,http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Job-Years_Revised5-8.pdf the U.S. government’s official metric to measure jobs created by ARRA funds. In 2011, PECI moved its headquarters to a LEED Platinum Platinum building in downtown Portland. PECI added many energy-efficient features to the core building, including insulated low-e glass windows, a high-efficiency HVAC system, daylight dimming mechanisms and energy-efficient data center systems.  Corporate Social Responsibility  According to PECI's 2013 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, PECI's Portland office consumed 527,489 kWh of electricity and created 10.3 tons of waste in 2013, equal to about 91 pounds per employee and 0.36 pounds per employee per day. According to the EPA, in 2010, the average American generated 4.43 pounds of waste per day. 39 percent of PECI's total waste was recycled (2010 U.S. recycling rate: 34.1%) and 36 percent was composted. PECI employees traveled 2.4 million miles for commuting and business travel in 2013. About 55 percent of commuting miles were travelled via bicycle and public transit, with the remainder traveled by carpool or single-occupancy vehicle. PECI participated in volunteer, charitable, and educational activities with the Community Energy Project, Clark Center for Men, Friends of Trees, and the Northwest Earth Institute in 2013.  Energy Savings  The effectiveness of energy efficiency programs is typically measured by energy savings, in the form of electricity, gas, and water consumption that was avoided as a result of program efforts. In 2012, PECI programs saved 328 million kWh of electricity, 3.6 million Therms of gas and 3.36 million gallons of water.http://www.peci.org/results According to an energy savings equivalency calculator from the Environmental Protection Agency, these energy savings equal: # The annual greenhouse gas emissions produced by 51,963 cars # The monthly CO2 emissions of 2.79 million households # The CO2 emissions from consuming 1,073 railroad cars of coal # The CO2 emissions from consuming 21,891 tanker trucks of gasoline  Awards  2013 Governor's Sustainability Award from Oregon Sustainability Board 2013 Best Green Companies to Work for in Oregon (35th) 2013 Sustainability at Work Gold Certification 2012 Portland Afoot Top 25 Best Employers for Low-Car Commuters 2012 Best Green Companies to Work for in Oregon (26th) 2012 Energy Star Partner of the Year – Utah Home Performance Program 2012 Energy Star Sustained Excellence - Questar Thermwise Builder Program 2011 Best Non-Profits to Work For in Oregon 2011 100 Best Green Companies to Work for in Oregon (22nd) 2011 City of Portland Climate Champion 2010 AESP Program Design and Implementation Award – Energy Trust of Oregon New Homes Program 2010 100 Best Green Companies to Work for in Oregon (15th) 2010 Energy Star Partner of the Year – Questar Gas 2010 Energy Star Sustained Excellence – Rocky Mountain Power 2010 Pacific Gas & Electric Integration Awards – AirCare Plus 2010 San Diego Gas & Electric Energy Champion 2009 Energy Star Partner of the Year – Rocky Mountain Power 2009 Energy Star Partner of the Year – Questar Gas 2009 100 Best Green Companies to Work for in Oregon (37th) References Category:Organizations based in Portland, Oregon ","title":"Portland Energy Conservation"},{"id":"24703869","text":"Gunnister is a small 'abandoned' village at the North-West Mainland in Shetland, Scotland.

Samuel Hallifax, by Henry Edridge. Life He was born at Mansfield on 8 January 1733, eldest son of Robert Hallifax, apothecary, and by Hannah, daughter of Samuel Jebb of the same town. Robert Hallifax, M.D. (1735–1810), who was physician to the future George IV, was a younger brother. Sir Richard Jebb and John Jebb were his first cousins. After attending the grammar school of Mansfield, Hallifax was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, as an ordinary sizar 21 October 1749, and was elected to a closed scholarship. In January 1754 he graduated B.A., when he was third wrangler in mathematics, and won the chancellor's gold medal for classics, and in 1755 and 1756 he carried off one of the members' prizes. He was elected foundation scholar on 16 February 1754, and admitted to a fellowship on 22 June 1756. Next year he proceeded M.A., and before resigning his fellowship at Jesus College, early in 1760, held the college offices of praelector, dean, tutor, steward, and rental bursar. On migrating to Trinity Hall Hallifax was elected to a fellowship (3 April 1760), became its tutor; he was noted for his harshness towards Samuel Heywood, a Unitarian. He took the degree of LL.D. in 1764. He was presented to the rectory of Cheddington, Buckinghamshire, 30 November 1765, and held it until 1777, but continued to reside at Cambridge, and retained his fellowship until 1 November 1775. When the chair of Arabic became vacant in January 1768, Hallifax, then deputy of William Ridlington, professor of civil law, defeated his cousin, John Jebb, who had studied Arabic for some time, in the contest for the Arabic chair. He held as sinecures for two years the positions of Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic and Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic (1768–70); and fell out with John Jebb. Their differences were aggravated in 1772 on the attempt to abolish subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles by clergymen and members of the universities, when some letters signed 'Erasmus' in the newspapers, in favour of subscription, were generally ascribed to Hallifax. He was attacked by Ann Jebb with such wit and sarcasm that he is said to have called on Wilkie, her publisher, to request him not to print any more of her writings. They were again at odds in 1774, when Jebb carried his grace for a syndicate to promote annual examinations. From 1770 to 1782 Hallifax held the regius professorship of civil law at Cambridge. He was created chaplain in ordinary to the king in February 1774, and D.D. by royal mandate in 1775. When Francis Topham vacated his position as master of faculties at Doctors' Commons, Hallifax succeeded to the post (1770). In 1778 Mrs. Gally, for his services to religion, rewarded him with the rectory of Warsop, Nottinghamshire, where he made the parish choir famous for miles round. His candidature in 1779 for the mastership of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, was unsuccessful. On 27 October 1781 he was consecrated bishop of Gloucester, and on 4 April 1789 he was confirmed as bishop of St Asaph, apparently the first English bishop who had been translated to a Welsh see. He died of kidney stones at Dartmouth Street, Westminster, on 4 March 1790. His wife, whom he married in October 1775, was Catherine, second daughter of William Cooke, dean of Ely. Their surviving issue was one son and six daughters; the widow is said to have received a pension from George III. John Milner suggested in his End of Religious Controversy that Hallifax died a Catholic; he was contradicted in the British Critic April 1825, and Samuel Parr discussed the matter and Hallifax in detail. Works His publications comprised: * Saint Paul's Doctrine of Justification by Faith explained in three Discourses before the University of Cambridge, 1760; 2nd edit. 1762, in which he replied to some previous sermons by John Berridge on Justification by Faith alone, without Works. *Two Sermons preached before the University, 1768, in praise of Benefactors. *Three Sermons preached before the University on the Attempt to abolish Subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, 1772, two editions; this produced an anonymous Letter to Dr. Hallifax upon the Subject of his three Discourses, 1772, by Samuel Blackall. * An Analysis of the Roman Civil Law, in which a Comparison is occasionally made between the Roman Laws and those of England: being the heads of a course of Lectures publickly read in the University of Cambridge, 1774; 2nd edit. 1775; 4th edit. 1795; new edition, with alterations and additions by James William Geldart, 1836. * Twelve Sermons on the Prophecies concerning the Christian Church, and in particular the Church of Papal Rome. Warburtonian Lectures at Lincoln's Inn, 1776. * Sermons in Two Volumes by Samuel Ogden. To which is prefixed an Account of the Author's Life, with a vindication of his writings by Hallifax, 1780, 1786, 1788, and 1805. Hallifax followed Samuel Ogden at the Round Church, Cambridge. *Preface by Hallifax to a Charge delivered by Bishop Butler at his Primary Visitation of Durham Diocese, 1786. The preface was added to editions of Joseph Butler's Analogy from 1788. He contributed to the university collections of poems printed in 1760 and 1763. He published fourteen single sermons, and that preached in 1788 on the anniversary of the martyrdom of King Charles provoked 'A Letter to the Bishops on the Test Acts, including Strictures on Hallifax's Sermon 1789.' An apology for the clergy and liturgy of the established church was attributed to him by Michael Lort.

These include Pacific oysters, blue mussels, littleneck clams, scallops, and bull kelp. Finfish farming has been prohibited in Alaska by the 16.40.210 Alaskan statute, however non-profit mariculture continues to provide a steady supply of aquaculture in the state. Many organizations that helped the ban, now encourage the growing of shellfish and other oysters.Martin, James D. \\"Alaska seeks to establish oyster industry.\\" Feedstuffs 29 Jan. 2001: 29. Expanded Academic ASAP. Web. 14 Oct. 2009 Overview Salmon boats fishing on the Naknek River. Alaskan aquaculture is an important resource not just for the state, but for the entire country. Alaska is filled with a variety of aquatic fish, shellfish, plants, and other species that all play an important role in the aquaculture process. Commercial salmon and herring fisheries dominate Alaskan harvesting and production and harvesting sights are located on the coast line throughout the state, producing an average of 750 million pounds each year. Commercial shellfish fisheries also greatly contribute to annual statistics and at its high point 400 million pounds of shellfish have been produced in one year.http://www.cf.adfg.state.ak.us/geninfo/geninfo.php Cultured species Salmon The commercial fishing of returning salmon to Alaskan waters provides one of the most important industries in Alaska. Beginning in the 1880s, commercial salmon fishing has become a dominant area of Alaskan aquaculture, although hatchery salmon still make up the minority of the catch. Over the course of four years the average salmon harvest by commercial fishermen was approximately 157 million fish or 742 million pounds and averaged an annual value of over $230 million. Many inhabitants of Alaska greatly rely on the salmon harvest each year for income and cultural purposes. Major salmon fisheries in Alaska are located in the Yukon, Bristol Bay, Southeast/Yakutat, Cook Inlet, Chignik/Kodiak, Copper River, and Prince William Sound areas.Woodby, Doug, et al. Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Spec. issue of Commercial Fisheries in Alaska Special Publication 05-09 (2005): 1-66. PDF-1,059K file. Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game . Herring Beginning in the 1880s, commercial herring ocean ranching has continued to support commercial fisheries and feed the Alaskan people. Herring are harvested in late summer to fall in southern Alaska and Norton Sound areas after the spawning process has taken place. Spawning begins in the early spring in Southern Alaska and ends in the middle of the summer months in the northern Bering Sea. Major commercial herring fisheries are located in the Norton Sound, Cape Romanzof, Kuskokwi, Bristol Bay, Alaskan Peninsula, Kodiak, Prince William Sound, and Southeast Alaska areas. Herring eggs can also be harvested after they are deposited by the herring on shoreline vegetation, which includes wild and Pound kelp. Crabs Crabs are a dominant and famous source of aquaculture found in Alaska, particularly the king crab, which includes the varieties of blue, scarlet, golden, and red. Red king crabs dominate over the other species in commercial harvesting and are most commonly found in the Bristol Bay area and less commonly but still found in the Southeast, Norton Sound, and Adak areas. Other important crabs harvested in Alaskan areas include the Tanner crab, snow crab, and Dungeness crab. Shrimp In the 1980s shrimp production was a key and important role in Alaskan shellfish harvests but an increase in Pacific cod caused shrimp production to decrease. Small trawl shrimp fisheries are still located in Southeast Alaska, Kodiak, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Island areas. Other species Clams- Alaska has clam fisheries in Southeast Alaska and fisheries in the Cook Inlet specifically for razor clams. Scallops- Scallops are dredged off the Eastern Gulf of Alaska and continue to be the overall largest commercial species in the world.

Joseph and George Cox are known through the Allegheny Mountains as The Lost Children of the Alleghenies. George and Joseph Cox, then aged seven and five respectively, disappeared from their home in Pavia on April 24, 1856. Their dead bodies were found several days later in the surrounding woods and they were buried in the Mount Union United Methodist Church cemetery in nearby Lovely. There is a small memorial to them in the Spruce Hollow forest in Blue Knob State Park, Pennsylvania. Text of the monument erected to remember the Lost Children of the Alleghenies. The grave site of the Children in Mount Union Cemetery, PA. The monument in Blue Knob State Park, PA. Photo of the sign erected explaining the events of the Lost Children of the Alleghenies in Blue Knob State Park, PA. Legend behind the story George, 7, and Joseph, 5, were the sons of Samuel and Susannah Cox. The Cox family lived in a cabin built by Samuel for his wife and kids. At this time old-growth logging had not yet begun in this area of Pennsylvania and the area was still heavily forested.Lost children still haunting mountain usnews.com Retrieved 27 September 2018 During the morning of April 24, 1856, Samuel Cox heard his dog barking in the forest and thought that it must have treed a squirrel. Samuel retrieved his rifle and headed into the woods. It is thought that while Samuel was gone, the boys must have strayed from home to follow their father. Susannah thought that Samuel had taken the boys with him. It was only when Samuel returned without them that they realized their children were gone. They called for the boys but received no replies. Samuel went for help from his nearest neighbors and by that evening more than one hundred men were searching for the children. Fires were lit in the forest in the hope that the boys would see one and approach. Nearly a thousand people showed up to search the next day. A nearby stream, Bob's Creek, was surging with spring snow melt and it was thought that there was no way the boys could have crossed to the other side without drowning. A search of the creek was performed but the boys were not found.The Lost children Roadsideamerica.com Retrieved 27 September 2018 On April 26, suspicion fell on Samuel and Susannah Cox. It was thought that they might have murdered their children in the hope of gathering donations from a sympathetic population. The Cox cabin and garden were searched but no bodies were located. The searchers went so far as to bring in a dowser and a witch from Somerset County. The dowser found nothing and the witch, despite claiming to know the children's location, led a search team through the woods for hours without turning up anything. The legend tells that the night after the disappearance a local farmer, Jacob Dibert, heard about the missing children and remarked to his wife that he wished to be able to dream of the boys' location. On May 2, 1856, he had a dream in which he walked a path through the woods past a dead deer, a child's shoe and a fallen birch tree and eventually to a copse of birch trees in a small ravine. Here he found the bodies of the Cox boys. The dream reoccurred on the two following nights. Dibert told no-one but his wife about the dream; however, he felt that the dream was prophetic and on May 7 he told his brother-in-law Harrison Whysong. Whysong recognised elements from Dibert's dream and the two men decided to make a search, culminating in the discovery of the bodies just as the dream had described - under birch trees in a small ravine reached along a track with a dead deer, a child's shoe and a fallen birch.  Cultural impact  In 1906, for the 50th anniversary of the event, the community of Pavia took up donations for a Lost Children of the Alleghenies Monument to honor the Cox family. In 1910, they erected the monument at the spot where Joseph and George Cox were found over 50 years earlier.

Academic responsibility and relevance is crucial, and is purposefully combined with the necessary sport and cultural activities that forms a comprehensive education inside and outside the classroom to empower a pupil for the future. The school use and participate in the contemporary learning materials of indicato. It is a suite of private confessional Christian schools with a drive for education suited to the information age, and the world of the 21st century. The Bible is the Word of God, and confessionally the schools refer to the three confessional tracts of the Synod of Dordrecht (1618/19) and this basis encourages education to be relevant to educate and train pupils to be able to preserve, develop and utilise the creation of God to the best of the wonderful ability that God has given to man. From 2014 the schools are located on its own premises in Raslouw, Centurion, Gauteng, South Africa. The schools are Afrikaans in language and culture, and pupils enjoy the benefits of being schooled in a triangle of home, church and school that strives to be in unison. The schools The primary school started in January 2000 and grew from two teachers and six pupils to a fully-fledged set of schools from 3 year olds to Grade 9. The school went up to Grade 12 (matric) in 2011, but the lack of suitable infrastructure showed that the high school could not fully provide for the needs of the 21st century pupil, where academic, sport and cultural participation and pride requires facilities more than what were available in the small classrooms rented at churches. Academically the high school's ability to successfully teach CIE was proven, with the three matric pupils of 2011 currently successfully studying at three different universities in South Africa, and boasting numerous distinctions in their AS examination achievements. After 10 years of existence as a parent owned mutual school, the school was bought out in 2010 by indicato inligting (Edms) Bpk in which two families with children in the school were involved. The schools are owned and operated by Raslouw Onderwys (Edms) Bpk which is a full subsidiary of indicato. The current managing director, Leonard van der Dussen was a founder member of the school since its earliest planning. The school obtained its own land in September 2013 and operates on this site since January 2014. One of the first permanent developments on this 2,6ha property in Raslouw, Centurion, South Africa, was the sports field. The specific land parcel is well placed close to major routes, just off the main road, and is a rectangular site that can be fully utilised. Existing trees are being preserved where possible, and the land has the qualities of space and natural Bosveld feel with which the South African child identifies. The school consists of three divisions: * Raslouw Pre-primêr (Pre-primary) - a toddler class for 3 - 5 year olds, and a Grade 0 (preparatory for primary school) class for 6 year olds.  Laerskool Raslouw (Primary School Raslouw) - Grades 1 - 7 (junior and secondary primary phases of three years each, with Grade 7 transitional to high school)  Hoërskool Raslouw (High School Raslouw) - Grade 8 and 9 These schools use the indicato curriculum up to Grade 7, and from thereon IGCSE and AS-levels of the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). The schools are Afrikaans language based, with strong emphasis on English as second language skills in a globalised world. Sport participation is encouraged, with athletics, rugby, netball, hockey, cricket and tennis as well as team chess, skululu and archery. General fitness is encouraged, and a biokinetics programme is part of the formal morning roster. The school has a full-time music teacher, and employs part-time specialists for individual music lessons (e g piano) and a junior and senior choir.

It follows the 1984 case in which American businessman Robert O. Marshall was charged with (and later convicted of) the contract killing of his wife, Maria. Adapted by John Gay and directed by Paul Wendkos, the miniseries was originally broadcast in two parts with a total runtime of 190 minutes. The cast includes Robert Urich, Joanna Kerns, Doris Roberts, Johnny Galecki, William Forsythe and Dennis Farina.  Plot  In Toms River, New Jersey, the Marshalls — Rob (Urich) and Maria (Kerns), and their three sons, 18-year-old Roby (Barry Gray), 17-year-old Chris (Jay Underwood) and 12-year-old John (Johnny Galecki) — are an apparently happy family living the American Dream. But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of $100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman. As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence. Rob admits to Sal that he hired Ferlin L'Heureux (William Forsythe), a private detective, on the night his wife was killed to find out how he lost all of his money. Roby has trouble coping with a recent newspaper article in which his mother's personal life has been attacked. Upset, he is almost involved in a car accident. The police find an audio tape which Rob recorded shortly before he attempted to kill himself. On tape, he speaks about L'Hereux, who in turn claims that Ricky Dunlap (David Andrews) was the man hired to murder Maria. On Christmas Eve, Rob is arrested. Roby visits him in jail and is assured by his father that he is not guilty. The trial begins at the Atlantic Courthouse in 1986. L'Hereux gives detailed testimony in which he claims that Rob hired him to murder Maria so that Marshall could collect on her insurance. L'Hereux states that he found her too beautiful to kill, and contacted Ricky Dunlap to finish the job. Under extreme pressure from the trial, Roby and John are unable to hide their emotions, and Chris turns into an angry young man wanting justice to be served. When the moment comes that Rob asks Roby to give false testimony which would provide him an alibi, it becomes clear to Roby that his father is not the person he thought him to be. Dunlap is found not guilty. The entire blame goes to Rob, disparaged by prosecuting attorney Kelly (Dennis Farina) as \\"a legend in his own mind\\" whom he considers many times worse than Dunlap, even if he was not the one who performed the actual murder. Rob is sentenced to death by lethal injection. The narration reveals that, in 1990, Rob is on death row, waiting for appeal; Roby finished college; Chris became a varsity swim coach; and John, who married at age 17, never stopped believing in his father's innocence. Cast Production and release Based on the 1989 true crime book Blind Faith by Joe McGinniss, the miniseries was initially broadcast in two parts, premiering on February 11, 1990. It was adapted by John Gay and directed by Paul Wendkos, with a total runtime of 190 minutes. Blind Faith was nominated in 1990 for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries, Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special (for part II), Outstanding Achievement in Hairstyling for a Miniseries or a Special (for part I) and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or a Special - Single Camera Production (for part II). It was also nominated in 1991 for an ACE Eddie award for Best Edited Episode from a Television Mini- Series (for part II). During filming, Joanna Kerns became very close with Robert and Maria Marshall's eldest son, Roby Marshall, who served as a consultant on the miniseries. It was through that relationship that Roby met actress Tracey Gold, who had costarred with Kerns on the TV series Growing Pains. Marshall and Gold married in 1994 and are currently raising four sons together. See also * Robert O.

The name of nearby Mount St. Leon is derived from that of the springs and settlement. Name origin According to one entry in the British Columbia Geographical Names Information System, the name is thought to have been conferred by an early hunter and trapper in the area, who had relatives in \\"St. Pol de Leon\\" (actually Saint-Pol-de-Léon), Finistère, France, but another account says it was named for one of the many places named St. Leon in Quebec which also had a mineral spring. History The springs were first discovered and land in the area claimed by Michael M. Grady of Revelstoke in 1894 who built a small hotel, then rebuilt it in 1901 and again in 1906 (Grady Lake and Mount Grady in the same area are named for M.M. Grady). The resort was popular throughout the Kootenays and thrived from being a port-of-call on the Arrow Lakes steamboat route, which connected with railway lines at Castlegar and Revelstoke. Due to the economic downturn in the first year of World War I, Grady closed the hotel and disconnected its supply of hot water from the springs. Citizens of Revelstoke appealed to him to create a townsite out of his original alienation of so they could build campsites and cottages for their own private use, which he did in 1918, with 10 cottages being erected soon after. The settlement was inundated, and its name rescinded, following the raising of the level of the Arrow Lakes by the Keenlyside Dam at Castlegar. Closure The private dirt road leading from the highway to the springs has been chained off and is now inaccessible as of the summer of 2016. A man died in the springs due to a heart attack, and the property owners became concerned about lawsuits. A rise in partiers and garbage left behind likely has also contributed to the closure.

Initially, they focused on European and American painting and sculpture of the mid-1940s through early 1960s, purchasing works by European postwar artists such as Jean Fautrier and Tàpies, and American Abstract Expressionists such as Franz Kline and Mark Rothko. They were also among the first patrons of Pop art, purchasing 11 of Robert Rauschenberg’s “combines” of the mid-1950s, as well as works by Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, and James Rosenquist.

The bog body was found on 12 May 1951 as the men were digging peat for fuel. It was discovered at a depth of about at grid reference HU3290 7330. A stone placed by the Northmavine History Group now marks the find location.  Description  The body is believed to date from the late 17th or early 18th century. Three coins found in a knitted purse were a 6-Stuiver piece from Nijmegen (Netherlands) dated to 1690, a 2-Stiver piece from Overijssel dated to 1681 and a Öre from Sweden dating from 1683. The knitted purse found with the body is believed to be the earliest example of two-colour knitting in Shetland. The man was dressed in many woollen clothes, all of which survived burial in the peat in excellent condition. He wore a woollen shirt, a suit of long coat and short wide breeches, and an outer jacket. He had two caps, a pair of gloves and knitted stockings. His remains suggest he was walking in wintertime, and he may have died of illness or exposure. It is not possible to see any settlement from where he was buried and weather in late 17th and early 18th century northern Europe was extremely cold and stormy. His body was purposefully buried, with the objects he carried carefully buried with him. It is not known if he was a Shetlander or a visitor to the islands. The coins were common in Shetland at that time because of trade by north European merchants, so these give no clear indication of his origin. Other items found included a leather belt, a silk ribbon, three woollen cords, a small knitted fragment, a birch stick, a wooden stave tub, a knife handle, a horn spoon, a quill, a horn container with wooden stopper, and two flat pieces of wood. The only remains of the man were a piece of skull with dark hair, finger and toe nails, fragments of bone from the sleeves and in one stocking. Items found on the body All objects in the original find went to Edinburgh and are now in the collections of the National Museums of Scotland. Some objects are on permanent display in various parts of NMS galleries. Immediately after the burial was discovered, the finds were taken to a local house, where some people knitted replicas of the stockings and purse. These replicas are on display in Tangwick Haa Museum in Northmavine, Shetland. In 2009, Shetland Museum and Archives made full replicas of all of the finds, which are together displayed in a permanent Gunnister Man display in Lerwick, Shetland. Purse The purse was originally a natural mixed grey colour, with stripes of red and white pattern on it. It is difficult to know if the man's garments were knitted in Shetland or elsewhere, but even if they weren't, it proves that stranded knitting, now known as fair isle knitting, had been at least seen in Shetland by the beginning of the 18th century. Gloves The gloves are well-knitted with decorative stitches on the upper palms and gauntlets. They are similar to other gloves of the period. The palm of the right glove is more worn and patched than the left glove, suggesting he was right-handed. Open-work knitting A small piece of open-work knitting was found with the man's findings, with a pattern of three concentric diamonds but no worked edge. Small pieces of knitting were also found sewn into the lining of the man's jacket, and this fragment may have been kept to use as a patch.

C-AKv is an abbreviation of Compact Automatische Kupplung vereinfacht in German, translating to Compact Automatic Coupler simplified in English. CAKv coupler on a goods wagon.  History  In the 1970s a new type of automatic coupler was developed by the European railways. This was called the UIC automatic coupler and represented a West European variant of the AK69e type and the East European Intermat type. It was intended as a full replacement for the buffers-and-chain setup, which is not suitable for heavy loads, very time-consuming to be connected, and requires intensive maintenance. As it would have had to be introduced all across Europe within a very short time frame, this introduction was repeatedly postponed. In addition, the UIC automatic coupler was not compatible with the existing chain couplings, which would have made this conversion budgetarily difficult for some of the European state railways to carry out. Even though the project was abandoned it did lead to one thing: As such a center coupling will have to handle all the power from pushing (like the buffers in a buffer-and-chain setup), pulling (like the chain in a buffers-and-chain setup) and damping the forces when the train is slowing down or braking. All these forces must be absorbed, so a direct conversion of older rolling stock (locomotives/engines, various kinds of wagons, etc.) is not possible, so changes will be needed. But from around 1970 every piece of rolling stock equipped with buffers-and-chain was prepared for conversion, which can be seen by looking at the square hole behind where the chain is bolted to the piece of rolling stock. Thus, it is basically a matter of removing the chain, mounting the new coupler in the hole (or cutout, if you want) and fastening it, and done. Of course, until every piece of rolling stock is converted (or at least those for international traffic)), it will be necessary to keep the buffers to do their previous job (absorbing pushing and braking force) as the chain on an unconverted piece of rolling stock will not be able to do so, and the C-AKv will then do the job of the hook in the buffers-and-chain setup. The C-AKv coupler was developed by SAB WABCO, now Faiveley Transport Witten GmbH. Unlike the UIC automatic coupler, it is compatible with the existing chain coupler, which would allow for a longer transition period. Since the year 2002, the C-AKv has been on trial on the German railways. It is used on heavy coal block trains between the opencast mines at Profen and the Schkopau power plant. At this time, the German railways, Faiveley and the Technical University of Berlin are developing possible transition scenarios for a general introduction of the C-AKv coupler. Heaviest Trains In a field test starting in 2004, the trains on the connection from the brown coal strip mine near Wählitz to the Schkopau Power Station were equipped with C-AKv-couplers which showed that regular wheel replacements shrunk below a third due to reduced wear. The solution has been kept and it spawned further investigations. Beginning in late 2009, eighteen DBAG Class 189 electric locomotives owned by DB Schenker were converted to C-AKv couplers, in order to handle 6,000 tonne iron ore trains from Rotterdam to the Dillingen steel works in Saarland, replacing the previous German class 151 double units and Dutch class 6400 triple units commonly used on these workings previously. As these locomotives are also capable of operating on both the 15 kV AC and 25 kV AC (and 1.5 kV DC, for a short stretch under reduced power) overhead system on the German and Dutch networks, locomotive changes on the Dutch-German border are no longer required. Loaded trains are commonly operated by two 189s in a multiple unit setup, with the wagons retaining the AK69e type couplers they have been fitted with since the 1980s.  Design  Being an evolved version of the UIC AK69e coupler, the C-AKv coupler has the same basic outline as the SA3 coupler. Unlike the Russian SA-3 coupler, however, connectors for brake air lines and - if required - electric conduits are integrated into the coupler, which are automatically connected while coupling up. Also, these pneumatic and electric connectors are compatible with the buffers and chain setup, as opposed to previous types. Since the brake line and electric connectors are integrated into the coupler's main body rather than in a separate body part below the main body, as had been the case on the AK69e type, it is possible to couple C-AKV equipped stock to stock not thus equipped. The design is much more compact than the former SA3 coupler. The shape is slightly different from that of the SA-3 coupler, due to an additional alignment horn and the matching pocket on the opposite side. These two components allow for greater vertical stability in two connected C-AKv couplers.

Folk (1811 - June 25, 1885) was an American law enforcement officer in New York City during mid-to late 19th century. A prominent police official during the early years of the Municipal Police Department, Folk served as the first police chief of the Brooklyn Municipal Police from 1851 to 1865, NYPD police inspector until 1870 and police superintendent from 1873 to 1875. He was also a participant in the Bread Riot of 1837, the Angel Gabriel riot of 1854 and the Draft Riot of 1863, helping defend both the offices of the New York Tribune and the Brooklyn Eagle from rioters. Biography John S. Folk was born in Brooklyn, New York around 1811. His exact birthplace was a farmhouse which occupied the present-day site of the Municipal Building. Folk worked as a carpenter prior to joining the borough's first organized police force, the Brooklyn City Watch, during the 1830s. He remained \\"a trusted member\\" of the city watch throughout his service and, according to the New York Times, his \\"large and powerful frame, his undaunted courage, and his ceaseless energy made him a valuable preserver of public peace\\". This was especially evident in his conduct during the Bread Riot of 1837 in which he reportedly displayed \\"remarkable coolness, bravery, and genius for leadership\\" and was a key figure putting down the riot. The city watch was then composed of officers whose members were elected and, within a short time, Folk was nominated as Head Constable. He was continuously elected to the position several times until 1851 when the Brooklyn Municipal Police was formed. He and ex-Police Chief Joel Smith were nominated for Brooklyn Chief of Police, which Folk won with a large majority, and held the position for almost 15 years. During 1854, he led police during the Angel Gabriel riot as well as violence among abolitionists and volunteer firefighters. It was while battling with firemen that Folk was nearly killed from being struck on the head with an iron wrench and carried the scar for the rest of his life. In the Draft Riots of 1863, Folk led a small police detachment into Manhattan. After helping stabilize Uptown Manhattan, he joined with Inspector Daniel C. Carpenter to relieve the besieged defenders of the New York Tribune office. After the rioters were driven from the New York Tribune, he and Carpenter trapped them in City Hall Park and broke up the mob. Folk later returned to Brooklyn where he further suppressed rioting over the next few daysAsbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 131) and saved the Brooklyn Eagle offices as well. He also protected the Plymouth Church who, with a group of 40 other officers, stood guard in the lecture room and behind the church organ as Reverend Henry Ward Beecher gave a Sunday sermon and church services.Griswold, Stephen Morrell. Sixty Years with Plymouth Church. New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1907. (pg. 176) At the end of the American Civil War, the modern Metropolitan Police Department was established by the New York State Legislature. The newly formed Board of Commissioners, which then included Brooklyn and Staten Island under its jurisdiction, appointed Folk to the rank of police inspector and gave him authority over the entire Brooklyn police force. He was eventually legislated out of office when the Brooklyn Board of Commissioners was formed in 1870, with Patrick Campbell being appointed superintendent. Two years later, Folk was made a police inspector and succeeded Campbell as superintendent a year later. He held this position until Campbell was reappointed in 1875. Folk remained with the police force for several more years until he began suffering health problems brought on by old age. In 1885, he became seriously ill and suffered from dropsy for around two weeks prior to his death. Folk died at his Skillman Street home on the morning of June 25, 1885. A special meeting of NYPD police captains was held shortly afterwards, which included Superintendent Campbell and Inspector John MacKellar, to appoint a committee to handle the funeral arraignments. This was headed by Captains Cornelius Woglom, Henry L. Jewett and James McLaughlin. The funeral was held at Folk's home the next evening and then interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in a private burial. He was survived by two sons and three daughters. One of his sons, William H. Folk, was a noted veteran police detective and captain of the Twelfth Precinct at the time of his father's death. A daughter, Elizabeth, was married to Samuel H. Wilson in the late 1870s, and their daughter, Vinia, was born around 1880. This Wilson-Folk marriage dissolved in December, 1891.\\"Brooklyn Eagle\\", Page 7, December 23, 1897. Eight years later, Wilson married Miss Margaret D. McNeal in Newburgh, New York in June 1898. His wife Elizabeth did not remarry, and was a schoolteacher in Brooklyn until her death in 1912. Her daughter Vinia married Alexander Cruden in about 1906, and they had one son, Milton A. Cruden, an executive with Con Edison who died childless in 1967 while on vacation in Canada. References Further reading *Barnes, David M.

Sophie Margareta von Knorring, née Zelow (28 September 1797 – 13 February 1848), was a Swedish novelist and noble. She is regarded as a pioneer of the realistic novel in Sweden. Most of her novels are romantic love stories in an aristocratic environment. Biography She was born the offspring of the noble major Christer Göran Zelow, chamberlain at the royal court, and Helena Sophia Gripenstedt, at the manor Gräfsnäs on 28 September 1797. She and her four younger sisters was given an education regarded suitable for a female noble before marriage and debuting in aristocratic high society life: German, English, French, Italian, Music, painting and dance, all provided for by private teachers at home. They were taught religion, history and literature by the poet Arvid August Afzelius. She lived in the capital of Stockholm with her mother and sisters from 1810, where she debuted in society in the 1812–13 season. This was a particularly lively society season in Stockholm, which is estimated to have affected her and her work: she was introduced to Madame de Staël, for whom she felt deep admiration. She also watched Racine and Corneille performed by the French theatre company, including the famous Marguerite Georges, which had been expelled from Russia, and tableau vivants and pantomimes performed by Henriette Hendel-Schütz, which made a great success in Stockholm. In 1814, her father was ruined, and the family lived under limited circumstances. In 1820, she married colonel Baron Sebastian von Knorring. Her marriage in did not change her economic situation much, as though her spouse was a noble, he supported himself merely at his salary. She followed her spouse on his commendations: from 1834, they lived permanently in Axevalla. From 1827, she suffered from consumption, and though she \\"long mastered it successfully\\",Sophie M Knorring, von, urn:sbl:11659, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Carl-Edvard Nattsén), hämtad 2014-11-15. she was forced to spend her winters inside, and eventually died from it. She was able to travel abroad a couple of times; she visited Copenhagen in 1838 and Germany and Austria in 1846. Work Sophie von Knorring debuted in 1834. As her first novels depicted several private people, such as her own former love objects, she initially wished to remain anonymous. Her debut Cousinerna (The cousins) treats the subject of love opposite duty. A reoccurring theme in all her work was the tragedy in having to give up forbidden love, though this was also something necessary to do in the end. Her love stories normally portrayed the passionate love affair between a demonic male character and a virtuous female, who tragically but heroically defeated her forbidden desire with sense, religion and duty, even when acknowledging that there is nothing more painful in life than forsaking love.Sophie M Knorring, von, urn:sbl:11659, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Carl-Edvard Nattsén), hämtad 2014-11-15. In her novel Förhoppningar (Hopes), the hero of the story was the sixteen-year-old stepson and his former stepmother, the widow Ottilia, which was a controversial combination in the 19th century. According to the critic Böök: \\"She caresses desires in parallel with praising duty\\",Sophie M Knorring, von, urn:sbl:11659, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Carl-Edvard Nattsén), hämtad 2014-11-15. which was reoccurring theme in her work. von Knorring herself stated that her true element was \\"the deepest secrets of the human of every day life\\". In her novel Torparen (The Farmer), her first novel not set in an aristocratic environment, she defended the right of \\"people of the lower order\\" to have their stories told without prejudice, as \\"they think, feel, act, rejoice and suffer the same as we do - though under different circumstances\\".Sophie M Knorring, von, urn:sbl:11659, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Carl-Edvard Nattsén), hämtad 2014-11-15. During the 1830s and -40s, her books were translated to German, French, English and Danish. Sophie von Knorring was inspired by Fredrika Bremer, though their opinion regarding feminism differed. Bremer has described von Knorring as a frivolous, witty and vivacious aristocrat with a consuming passion, who only succumbed to religion on her death bed.Sophie M Knorring, von, urn:sbl:11659, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Carl-Edvard Nattsén), hämtad 2014-11-15.

She engaged publicly in an analysis of the psychology of adultery, which made her a target of Almqvist and von Braun. With her friend Malla Silfverstolpe, she participated in the public debate regarding common law marriage: in her novels, she wrote passionately of the strength of forbidden love, but they always ended in her characters tragically forsaking love for duty, and she objected to Almqvist radical idea that people should be able to live together for love without being married. Upon this, Almqvist replied in his article: \\"Why people argue against what they deep inside desire with the most heavenly corner of their soul\\".Sophie M Knorring, von, urn:sbl:11659, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Carl-Edvard Nattsén), hämtad 2014-11-15.

Ford Memorial Bridge. Design The bridge is a steel spandrel-braced (cantilever) arched design with a concrete deck. There are five arched trusses, each long, and two approach spans at each end, all supported by a foundation of stone piers. The deck is wide, and consists of two vehicle lanes, each flanked by a pedestrian sidewalk. The bridge originally contained trolley tracks, but these were removed in 1950. History The first bridge across the Tennessee River at this site was a temporary pontoon bridge built during the American Civil War. It was followed by a permanent bridge with stone supporting piers, built by Union General Ambrose E. Burnside, that was washed away in a flood in March 1867. Knox County built a covered bridge at the site, which opened on May 2, 1875, but it was blown down by a tornado shortly afterward. The county sold the surviving piers and rights-of-way to G. W. Saulpaw, who built a wooden Howe truss bridge at the site in 1880. Saulpaw's bridge stood until 1898, when it was demolished after the completion of the Gay Street Bridge. The Gay Street Bridge under construction, circa 1897–1898; the Saulpaw bridge (1880–1898) is on the left The Gay Street Bridge was designed by Charles E. Fowler, chief engineer of the Youngstown Bridge Company of Ohio.Designated Properties: Knoxville Historic Zoning Commission , Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission website, accessed October 15, 2009 Fowler later boasted that he had hastily sketched the bridge's design—which was chosen over three other bids—on the back of an envelope during his train ride to Knoxville to meet with county officials. Construction of the bridge, which was supervised by Fowler, began in 1897. Due to the scarcity of certain building materials during the Spanish–American War, Fowler was forced to modify his original design, and was constantly bickering with Knox County officials over who should pay the extra costs. The Gay Street Bridge opened to traffic on July 9, 1898.Gay Street Bridge, Historic Bridges of the United States website, accessed October 15, 2009 Knox County issued a statement proclaiming the bridge \\"for the use of all the world except Spain,\\" in reference to the war which had been raging throughout the year. Engineering journals such as Engineering News and Bridge Engineering praised the bridge's combination of safety and aesthetics. Because the 1898 bridge included trolley tracks, its construction accelerated residential development in the Island Home Park area on the south side of the river, which previously had been isolated from downtown Knoxville.Island Home History , Island Home Park Neighborhood Association website, accessed October 15, 2009 After receiving poor safety ratings, the bridge was extensively repaired in a project that required its closure from December 2001 to April 2004.

He was killed at the Second Battle of Zurich. Hotze was born on 20 April 1739 in Richterswil in the Canton of Zürich, in the Old Swiss Confederacy (present-day Switzerland). As a boy, he graduated from the Carolinum in Zürich and pursued studies at the University of Tübingen. In 1758, he entered the military service of the Duke of Württemberg, and was promoted to captain of cavalry; he campaigned in the Seven Years' War, but saw no combat. Later, he served in the Russian army in Russia's War with Turkey, (1768–74). His persistent attentiveness to Joseph II garnered for him a commission in the Austrian imperial army, and he served in the brief War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79). A diligent and creative commander, he rose quickly through the ranks. His campaigning in the War of the First Coalition, particularly at the Battle of Würzburg, earned him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa and, in 1798, the Commander's Cross. Archduke Charles placed him in full command of the center of the Austrian line at the First Battle of Zurich in 1799. He was killed by French musket fire in the morning mist near Schänis, in Canton of St. Gallen on 25 September 1799. Childhood and early career Friedrich Hotze was the second son of Johannes Hotze, a doctor and surgeon in Hessian military service and his Zürich-born wife, Juditha Gessner.

His regiment served in the field during the brief War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79). He served for a short time with the cuirassiers regiment Marquis de Voghera in Hungary, and returned with this regiment to Vienna in 1783. In 1784, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel (Oberstleutnant) and given command of the 1. Galican Lancers, which, in 1795, became the foundation of the 1. Lancers Regiment. Ebert.Freiherr von Hotze. Hotze's experience with military preparedness and organization gave him an advantage in establishing the lancers as a new combat arm. Recognizing the importance of lancers as part of the Austrian armed force, he embarked on an organizational and training program. The Emperor named him as commander of these corps, with the rank of a full colonel. In 1787, he returned temporarily to Russia, this time to establish a similar force in Catherine the Great's army. At the outbreak of the border war between the Ottoman Empire and Austria, he returned to Austria and took command of his regiment. Badge of the Order of Maria Theresa. Hotze received this award for his actions in the Würzburg campaign. French Revolutionary Wars Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the revolution in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, , pp. 41–59. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince of Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, adjacent to the French-German border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.Blanning, pp. 44–59. War of First Coalition In April 1792, Hotze and his regiment joined the autonomous Austrian Corps under Paul Anton II, Count von Esterházy in the Breisgau; although they took no part in any military clashes. Early in 1793, Hotze and his regiment were assigned to the Upper Rhine Army, commanded by General of Cavalry Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, at which time Hotze was promoted to major general. As commander of the third column, he played an essential role the storming of the line at Wissembourg and Lauterburg, for which he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. In the following year, 1794, he was assigned to the Army Corps of the Prince von Hohenlohe-Kirchberg, on the left bank of the Rhine, and later, from May–September at Heiligenstein on the Rhine, Schweigenheim, Westheim, and Landau in der Pfalz, against the French army commanded by the general of division Louis Desaix. Ebert. Freiherr von Hotze; Hürlimann, Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz. In each of these assignments, Hotze proved himself as a confident and courageous general against the stronger French Army of the Moselle. In recognition, he was promoted to Feldmarschall-leutnant, a rank unusual for a man from a non-aristocratic family. He was also raised to the rank of baron (Freiherr) by Emperor Francis II. In the campaign of 1795, he served again under the command of Wurmser; his troops secured Rhineland positions near Mannheim, and later took part in engagements at Edighofen and Kaiserslautern. Ebert, Freiherr von Hotze; Hürlimann, Hotze, in Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz. In the Battle of Neresheim (11 August 1796), Hotze commanded 13 battalions and 28 cavalry squadrons, a total of 13,300 men, and formed the center of Archduke Charles' line.Smith. \\"Neresheim.\\" Data Book.. Although Hotze's force managed to push the French out of several villages, his force was not strong enough to follow up on his advantage.Rickard, John. Battle of Neresheim, 11 August 1796. History of War, Peter Antill, Tristan Dugdale-Pointon, and John Rickard, editors. Accessed 14 February 2009. Following the action at Neresheim, his force participated in the joint battles of Neumarkt and Lauf, followed by the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September 1796. During these consecutive actions, Hotze's organization and initiative led to the overwhelming of the French lines. For his actions in this campaign, he was awarded a promotion on 29 April 1797, and received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa. Peace and the Congress of Rastatt The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg. While experiencing greater success in the north, in Italy, the Coalition's achievements were more limited. Despite the presence of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.Blanning, pp. 41–59. The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties, to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details. These were to be convened at a small town in the mid-Rhineland, Rastatt, close to the French border. The primary combatants of the First Coalition, France and Austria, were highly suspicious of each other's motives, and the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory than originally agreed. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. The Rastatt delegates could not, or would not, orchestrate the transfer of agreed upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic.Blanning, pp. 230–232. Other factors contributed to the rising tensions. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. Furthermore, the French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English actually discussed this possibility.John Gallagher. Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme, Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, , p. 70. In this caricature about the Helvetic Republic in Zürich 8 May 1798. People from Zürich dance around a tree as a symbol for freedom and revolution while French troops carry away the treasure of the overthrown City- State of Zürich. As an officer in the Habsburg army, Hotze lost his Swiss citizenship after the Swiss Revolution. Outbreak of war in 1799 With the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio on 17 October 1797, Hotze left Austrian service and returned to his home in Switzerland. Hardly had he arrived there when the government of the Swiss Confederation in Bern was overthrown, with the assistance of the French Directory. He returned to Austria, received a new commission and a new command. Hürlimann, Hotze, in Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz. He was already in the border regions between Switzerland, Austria, and Liechtenstein when the war broke out again in 1799. Archduke Charles of Austria, arguably among the best commanders of the House of Habsburg, had taken command of the Austrian army in late January. Although Charles was unhappy with the strategy set forward by his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, he had acquiesced to the less ambitious plan to which Francis and his advisers, the Aulic Council, had agreed: Austria would fight a defensive war and would maintain a continuous defensive line from the southern bank of the Danube, across the Swiss Cantons and into northern Italy. The archduke had stationed himself at Friedberg for the winter, east-south-east of Augsburg. His army settled into cantonments in the environs of Augsburg, extending south along the Lech River.Blanning, p. 232; ; Ramsey Weston Phipps. The Armies of the First French Republic, volume 5: The armies of the Rhine in Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Egypt and the coup d'etat of Brumaire, 1797-1799, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 49–50. As winter broke in 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, the Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl.John Young, D.D. A History of the Commencement, Progress, and Termination of the Late War between Great Britain and France which continued from the first day of February 1793 to the first of October 1801, in two volumes. Edinburg: Turnbull, 1802, vol. 2, p. 220. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before the Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.Rothenberg, pp. 70–74. The Army of the Danube, meeting little resistance, advanced through the Black Forest in three columns, through the Höllental (Hölle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt; a fourth column advanced along the north shore of the Rhine, and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of Lake Constance. Jourdan pushed across the Danube plain and took up position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen and eventually pushing toward the imperial city of Pfullendorf in Upper Swabia.Rothenberg, pp. 49–50. At the same time, the Army of Switzerland, under command of André Masséna, pushed toward the Grisons, intending to cut the Austrian lines of communication and relief at the mountain passes by Luziensteig and Feldkirch. A third Army of Italy, commanded by Louis Joseph Schérer, had already advanced into northern Italy, to deal with Ferdinand and the recalcitrant Neapolitans.Blanning, p. 232. War of the Second Coalition When Hotze took up arms against the French in Switzerland, the revolutionary Swiss government in Bern revoked his Swiss citizenship. For the Coalition allies, though, his Swiss roots made him an ideal emissary between Vienna and Confederation sympathizers in Switzerland. He worked with William Wickham, and a Colonel Williams, an Englishman in Austrian service, to establish the Bodensee (Lake Constance) Flotilla.David Hollins. Austrian Commanders of the Napoleonic Wars, 1792–1815. London: Osprey, 2004, pp. 18–19. As Feldmarschall-leutnant, he commanded 15,000 troops in the Vorarlberg against France's Army of Switzerland, commanded by André Masséna. After fortifying Feldkirch, he overwhelmed the fortress at St. Luzisteig, an important pass (elevation: ) in the Canton of Graubünden that links Swiss Confederation and Liechtenstein. Then, realizing that the main French army had crossed the Rhine and moved north of Lake Constance, he reorganized the defenses of Feldkirch, and deputed command to Franjo Jelačić, an able officer and commander. Hotze took 10,000 of the 15,500 troops designated for the defense of the Vorarlberg toward Lake Constance, intending to support Archduke Charles' left wing at the battles of Ostrach and, a few days later Stockach. Although his forces did not arrive in time to participate in the battles, the threat of their pending arrival influenced French planning.Ramsey Weston Phipps. The Armies of the First French Republic, volume 5: \\"The armies of the Rhine in Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Egypt and the coup d'etat of Brumaire, 1797–1799.\\" Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 49–50. In his absence, Jellacic's 5,500 men faced 12,000 under the command of generals of division Jean-Joseph Dessolles and Claude Lecourbe, inflicting enormous casualties (3000) on the French while suffering minimal losses (900) of their own.The third action at Feldkirch, 23 March 1799. Digby Smith. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. pp. 147–148. First Battle of Zurich By mid-May 1799, the Austrians had wrested control of Switzerland from the French as the forces of Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde pushed them out of the Grisons; after pushing Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's force, the Army of the Danube, back to the Rhine, Archduke Charles' own sizable force—about 110,000 strong—crossed the Rhine, and prepared to join with the armies of Hotze and Bellegarde on the plains by Zürich. The French Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube, now both under the command of Masséna, tried to prevent this merger of the Austrian forces; in a preliminary action at Winterthur, the Austrians succeeded in pushing the French forces out of Winterthur, although they took high casualties. Once the union took place in the first two days of June, Archduke Charles, supported by Hotze's command, attacked French positions at Zürich.Lawrence Shadwell. Mountain warfare illustrated by the campaign of 1799 in Switzerland : being a translation of the Swiss narrative, compiled from the works of the Archduke Charles, Jomini, and other...London: Henry S. King, 1875, p. 110; Blanning, p. 233. In first Battle of Zürich, on 4–7 June 1799, Hotze commanded the entire left wing of Archduke Charles' army, which included 20 battalions of infantry, plus support artillery, and 27 squadrons of cavalry, in total, 19,000 men. Despite being wounded, he remained on the field. His troops not only pushed the French back, but harassed their retreat, forcing them across the Limmat river, where they took up defensive positions. Ebert, Freiherr von Hotze; Hürlimann, Hotze, in Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz; and Blanning, pp. 233–34. Death at Second Battle of Zurich The village church at Schänis, where Hotze was originally buried. In August 1799, Archduke Charles received orders from his brother, the Emperor, to withdraw the Austrian army across the Rhine.Blanning, p. 252. While Charles could see this to be unreasonable—Alexander Suvorov had not yet reached central Switzerland, and it was folly to think that Alexander Korsakov's force of 30,000 and Hotze's 20,000 could hold all of the region until the arrival of the rest of the Russian force—the order was emphatic.Blanning, pp. 253–53. Charles delayed as long as he could, but in late August he withdrew his force across the Rhine and headed toward Philippsburg. When Suvorov heard of this breach of military common-sense, he wondered \\"the owl [referring to the Emperor] has either gone out of his mind, or he never had one.\\"Philip Longworth. The art of victory: the life and achievements of Generalissimo Suvarov. London: Constable, 1965 . p. 270. The order was eventually reversed too late for the Archduke to stop his withdrawal.Blanning, p. 253. Unlike Korsakov, Hotze knew his military business, and he had organized a competent defense of the St. Gallen border, on Korsakov's left flank, reasoning, correctly, that Suvorov was on his way and needed St. Gallen as a safe haven after he passed through the Canton Schwyz.Blanning, p. 254; Longworth, pp. 269–271. On the morning of 25 September, Hotze and his chief of staff, Colonel Count von Plunkelt, conducted a reconnaissance ride near the village of Schänis, on the Linth river, only from Richterswil, the village in which he had been born. In the heavy morning mist, they encountered a party French scouts from the 25th demi-brigade concealed behind a hedge. Summoned to surrender, Hotze wheeled around and spurred his horse, where both he and Colonel Plumkelt were killed by a volley of musketry.Shadwell Mountain Warfare p.207 Initially, Hotze was taken from the battlefield to the church in Schänis, where he was buried. In 1851, his body was moved to Bregenz and established in a monument there. Ebert. Freiherr von Hotze; Hürlimann, Hotze, in Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz. Consequences of Hotze's death Hotze was sorely missed. Despite mis- communication between and among the British, the Austrians and the Russians, the British miscalculation of the size of troops (consistently 10–25 percent higher than they actually were), the lack of Swiss volunteers, and failed promises of transport mules, Suvorov organized his impressive march across the Alps from northern Italy, counting on Korsakov and his Austrian allies to hold Zürich. His soldiers took the pass at St. Gotthard in a bayonet charge, and endured incredible hardships navigating the narrow trails of the Alps. By the time the Russian army reached Schwyz, preparing to descend from the mountains into the Zürich plain, Masséna's army already had crushed the incompetent Korsakov's force at Zürich, and, in Hotze's absence, Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French division overwhelmed the Austrian flank at Schänis and crossed the Linth unhindered.Blanning, p. 254. When Suvorov cleared the mountains, he had nowhere to go; he was forced to withdraw in another arduous march into the Vorarlberg, where his starving and ragged army arrived in late October. Between Korsakov's inability to hold the French at Zürich, and Hotze's death at Schänis, the Swiss campaign degenerated to an utter shambles.Blanning, p. 254; Young, D.D. vol. 2, pp. 220–228.

Asked why he was hiding, Falcon said to his father, \\"You guys said that, um, we did this for the show.\\" On October 18, 2009, Larimer County sheriff Jim Alderden announced his conclusion that the incident was a hoax and that the parents would likely face several felony charges. On November 13, 2009, Richard Heene pleaded guilty to attempting to influence a public servant. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and ordered to pay $36,000 in restitution, and Mayumi Heene was sentenced to 20 days of weekend jail.Balloon boy parents are sent to jail for hoax Following the incident, the Heene family maintains their innocence, claiming that they were pressured into a guilty plea under the threat of Mayumi Heene's deportation. Background Richard Heene () and met at an acting school in Hollywood, California, and married in 1997. Heene had tried acting and stand-up comedy without success and, for a time, he and his wife ran a home business producing demo reels for actors. Heene is also a handyman. Associates described him as a shameless self-promoter who would do almost anything to advance his latest endeavor. Heene became a storm chaser in the 1970s after a storm took the roof off a building he was working on. Heene's storm chasing has included riding a motorcycle into a tornado and reportedly flying a plane around the perimeter of Hurricane Wilma in 2005. He regularly involved his children in his endeavors, taking them along on UFO-hunting expeditions and storm-chasing missions. The Heenes have three sons named Falcon, Bradford and Ryo. A domestic violence investigation was launched at the Heenes' home in February 2009, after Mayumi was seen with a mark on her cheek and broken blood vessels in her left eye. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence. The family had been featured on the reality television show Wife Swap on two occasions, the second time as a fan-favorite choice for the show's 100th episode. During his time on the show, Heene expressed his belief that humanity descended from aliens and spoke of launching home-made flying saucers into storms. Heene had unsuccessfully sought the media's interest in a proposed reality show called The Science Detectives, which he envisioned as a documentary series \\"to investigate the mysteries of science\\". Months before the balloon incident Heene had pitched a reality show idea to the television channel TLC, but the network passed on the offer. After the balloon incident, the producer of Wife Swap said that a show involving the Heenes had been in development, but that the deal was now off. The producer declined to provide specifics. The Lifetime channel had been set to air one of the Wife Swap episodes involving the Heenes on October 29, 2009, but the station pulled the episode because of the balloon incident. Helium balloon Richard Heene said the saucer-shaped balloon was an early prototype of a vehicle which \\"people can pull out of their garage and hover above traffic\\". He also stated that, once \\"the high voltage timer\\" was switched on, the balloon \\"would emit one million volts every five minutes for one minute\\" in order to \\"move left and right—horizontal\\". The balloon, in diameter and high, was constructed from plastic tarps taped together, covered with an aluminum foil and held together with string and duct tape. Its base, in which Falcon allegedly rode, was a box made from a very thin piece of plywood and cardboard on the side, also held together by string and duct tape. Fully inflated, a balloon of this size would contain just over of helium. Helium's lift capacity at sea level and 0 °C is 1.113 kg/m3 (0.07 lbs/ft3) and decreases at higher altitudes and at higher temperatures. The volume of helium in the balloon has been estimated as being able to lift a total load, including the balloon material and the structure beneath it, of at sea level and at . Fort Collins is at an elevation of about and the balloon was estimated to have reached . Incident Location of Fort Collins in Larimer County in Colorado The family said they first suspected Falcon Heene was missing when, immediately after the balloon had taken off, Falcon's brother told them that he had seen the six-year-old climb into the balloon's basket beforehand. A home video released the following day shows the launch of the balloon. Richard inspects the basket, then his family count down in unison \\"three, two, one\\" before releasing the cord. Apparently believing the balloon to be tethered a few feet from the ground, the family starts screaming in distress when it floats off into the sky. Richard Heene, who can be seen kicking the wood frame that supported the balloon, yelled amidst a myriad of obscene words, \\"You didn't put the fucking tether down!\\" Falcon is nowhere to be seen and nobody mentions the possibility of Falcon being in the balloon. According to initial reports from the sheriff, the family first called the Federal Aviation Administration, although later the sheriff's office stated that \\"they had no confirmation that Richard Heene actually made the call to the FAA.\\" They then called Denver NBC affiliate KUSA-TV; they reportedly requested that the station send a news helicopter to track the balloon's progress, and then called emergency services. During the call to 911 at 11:29 AM local time (MDT) Richard Heene said, \\"I don't know whether it's possible you guys could detect the electricity that it emits ... it emits a million volts on the outer skin.\\" The balloon, tracked by helicopters, drifted for , passing through Adams County and Weld County. Planes were rerouted around the balloon's flight path. Reports that Denver International Airport was briefly shut down were later determined to be incorrect. The balloon finally landed two hours later at around 1:35 PM local time near Keenesburg, northeast of Denver International Airport. When the boy was not found inside the balloon, officials expressed concern that he might have fallen out during the flight. Although it was reported that it did not appear breached, Margie Martinez of the Weld County Sheriff's Office said that the door was unlocked in the balloon. A sheriff deputy reported seeing something fall from the balloon near Platteville, Colorado and a photograph of the balloon in flight with a small black dot below was said to suggest the boy may have fallen out or that something had detached from the balloon. Search and rescue crews in Colorado searched for the boy. At approximately 4:14 PM, CNN and other news reported that the boy was found hiding in a cardboard box in rafters above the garage, but county sheriff Jim Alderden later said, \\"For all we know he may have been two blocks down the road playing on the swing in the city park.\\" The New York Post estimated that the total cost of the rescue operation would be about $2 million, although this has yet to be verified. The helicopter flights alone during the rescue operation cost about $14,500. The Colorado National Guard assisted the effort with UH-60 Black Hawk and OH-58 Kiowa helicopters. Hoax allegations and criminal investigation Investigation After the incident, several news agencies began questioning whether it was a hoax. Editor & Publisher pointed out that \\"few had raised the issue of whether such a balloon could even lift off with a kid inside and then float the way it did\\" during the flight. The police initially said it did not appear to be a hoax, but when Falcon and his family were being interviewed later in the day by Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Larry King Live he asked Falcon, \\"Why did you not come out of the garage?\\" After his parents repeated the question, he responded, \\"You guys said that, um, we did this for the show.\\" Blitzer did not hear the answer, and when he was told by people in the control room what was said, he did not question the boy further after the statement was made. The next day, during interviews on ABC's Good Morning America and NBC's Today, the boy vomited when he was asked about his comment and again when his father was asked about it, fueling more suspicion. Falcon's answers prompted the sheriff's office to pursue further investigations as to whether the incident was part of a publicity stunt. On October 16, Alderden said that \\"the suggestion that the boy ... was coached to hide seems inconceivable.\\" Researcher Robert Thomas sold a story to Gawker alleging that he had helped plan a publicity stunt involving a weather balloon and investigators expressed a desire to interview him. Larimer County Sheriff's officials had consulted a Colorado State University physics professor, Brian Jones, who initially determined, based on the dimensions provided by Richard Heene, that the balloon could plausibly lift off with a boy of Falcon's reported size (). However, when authorities later measured the balloon, they concluded it was not large enough to lift the child. Upon inspecting the balloon, authorities learned it weighed more than Heene had said. Alderden said the base of the balloon could have handled without breaking, but to get airborne with those inside it would have to have been attached to a more powerful balloon. After viewing the home video of the balloon launch, Alderden said the balloon appeared to have been rising very quickly. During a press conference on October 18, Alderden called the incident a hoax, stating \\"we believe we have evidence at this point to indicate that this was a publicity stunt in hopes to better market themselves for a reality show.\\" He also said that charges in the case have not yet been filed but that the parents could face both misdemeanor and felony charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, filing a false report with authorities and attempting to influence a public servant. Alderden stated that his comments on October 16 were part of a \\"game plan\\" to keep the Heenes' trust. Richard Heene's lawyer, David Lane, announced on October 19 that Richard and Mayumi Heene would surrender to police as soon as charges were filed, and plead not guilty. According to the supporting affidavit that law enforcement submitted with their application for a search warrant, Mayumi later admitted that she \\"knew all along that Falcon was hiding in the residence.\\" The affidavit alleges that the couple planned the hoax about two weeks before releasing the balloon on October 15 and \\"instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax\\", for the purpose of making the family \\"more marketable for future media interests.\\" Guilty plea Richard Heene's attorney announced on November 12, 2009, that both parents intended to plead guilty to the charges filed against them, for which the prosecutor would recommend probation. The attorney's statement said that the threat of deportation of his wife, Mayumi Heene, who is a Japanese citizen, was a major factor in the plea negotiations. On November 13, Richard Heene pleaded guilty to a felony charge of attempting to influence a public servant. Mayumi Heene did not appear with him, but still faced a misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities. However, on January 7, 2010, Richard Heene told authorities that he only pleaded guilty to prevent his wife's potential deportation. On December 23, 2009, a judge sentenced Richard Heene to 90 days in jail and 100 hours of community service. He was also ordered to write a formal apology to the agencies that searched for Falcon. Mayumi Heene was sentenced to 20 days in jail, to be served through jail-supervised community service for two days a week. Mayumi was also allowed to begin her sentence after her husband's ended in order to ensure her children would be cared for, and the Heenes were also banned from receiving any profits from the hoax for several years. Richard Heene was also ordered to pay $36,000 in restitution. In a 2015 interview with Today, Heene claimed that the incident was not a hoax. In a 2019 interview with ABC News, the Heene family continued to maintain that the incident was not a hoax, with Mayumi Heene claiming to have confessed out of fear of deportation. Media attention For hours, the incident received extensive media coverage in many parts of the world, with local TV helicopters broadcasting live video of the balloon and rescue operation. The incident also sparked a \\"balloon boy\\" Internet meme, as the events were closely followed in blogs and social networking sites in real time, generating speculation, image editing jokes and parodies of the story, which started even when the boy's safety was uncertain. \\"Balloon boy\\" became the No. 1 search on Google within hours of the event and 34 of the top 40 searches on Google were related to Falcon Heene and the incident. On Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update, the balloon was interviewed by Seth Meyers. In July 2011, Richard Heene auctioned the balloon, selling it to Mike Fruitman—an Aurora, Colorado, businessman—for $2,502. Heene said that proceeds would go to victims of the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Criticism Editor & Publisher noted that \\"only after the crash did TV hosts stress that reports of [a] boy in it were 'unverified' and raise the possibility of a hoax.\\" Experts and commentators also criticized the media's vetting process, questioned the separation between journalism and reality television and raised concerns about the exploitation of children for news stories. Robert Thompson, of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said that the incident \\"was a wake-up call to the media but it's a wake-up call that every single one of us is going to sleep through.\\" Thompson blamed technology rather than the media for the problem: \\"There are two technological phenomena driving this—one is television satellite trucks and the ability to broadcast from anywhere and two is an unlimited number of platforms to place this stuff.\\" See also * Lawnchair Larry flight References External links    Uncut home video of the balloon's liftoff, released to media by the Heene family * Audio of the Heenes' 911 emergency call, released by the Larimer County Sheriff's Office * Heene 2009 Affidavit * Approximate flight path Category:2009 hoaxes Category:2009 in Colorado Category:2009 in the United States Category:Balloons (aircraft) Category:History of Fort Collins, Colorado Category:Hoaxes in the United States Category:Internet memes introduced in 2009 Category:October 2009 events in the United States ","title":"Balloon boy hoax"},{"id":"24704488","text":"Delancey Street Preview Center is an attraction located at Universal Studios Florida.

He helped to form a volunteer company comprising members of the royal staff. Under his leadership this unit fought in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. During a battle there, Beck and many of his men went missing, presumed killed. Early life and career Born in Oxwick, Norfolk, he was the son of Edmund Beck, land agent to the British royal family at Sandringham. Educated at Norfolk County School, North Elmham, he inherited his father's position on the King's estate, serving as Land Agent at Sandringham to Edward VII when Prince of Wales, 1891–1901, and when King, 1901–10; and to King George V from 1910 until the war. He was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (4th Class) in 1901 and created a Knight of the Order of St Olav by the King of Norway in 1906. Beck was instrumental in the formation of the Sandringham Company of Volunteers (\\"E\\" Company, 5th Battalion Norfolk Regiment, Territorial Force), which included grooms, gardeners, farm labourers and household staff from the King's estates. Beck raised the company as a Volunteer Force unit in 1906. War service and death Despite his age and the fact King George V told him not to go, he volunteered for foreign service after the outbreak of war and served with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force at Gallipoli, leading his company during the attack on Anafarta on 12 August 1915. He fought alongside his two nephews, Arthur Evelyn and Albert Edward Alexander Beck, who were both awarded the Military Cross. On that day, a large part of the Norfolks, including Capt. Beck and many of the Sandringham men, were missing in action. For several years, nothing was known of their fate, and a legend grew up that the battalion had vanished into a mysterious cloud. Queen Alexandra, Edward VII's widow, took a particular interest in establishing what had happened to the men, many of whom had been her employees. Many years later, a legend sprang up that they had disappeared in a massive cloud of unknown origin. However, after the 1918 Armistice of Mudros, 180 bodies were found \\"scattered over an area of about one square mile, at a distance of at least 800 yards behind the Turkish front line.\\" This information was kept from Queen Alexandra as it was felt she would be too distressed at the news. His body was not identified. His watch, given to him in 1915 by Sir Dighton Probyn VC, was bought from a Turkish officer after the war. It was presented to his heirs in 1922 and remains in the family's possession.McCrery, p. 109. Memorials Beck is commemorated on the Helles Memorial, with other servicemen with no known grave. There is a brass plaque in the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Sandringham and a stained glass window (by Karl Parsons) in the Church of St Peter and St Paul, West Newton. He and 18 other men from the company who died at Suvla Bay, Gallipoli are commemorated on the Sandringham war memorial cross and at West Newton parish church. Film portrayal In 1999, a film was made, entitled All the King's Men, depicting the formation of the Sandringham company, its fate, and Beck's role in this. Beck was portrayed by David Jason. Family Beck married Mary Plumpton Wilson in 1891 and had five daughters. His only son died in infancy.

Bates, an 18-year-old college freshman, was stabbed and slashed to death on the grounds of Riverside City College. Police determined the assailant had disabled the ignition coil wire and distributor of Bates's Volkswagen BeetleThe Hunt for Zodiac: The Inconceivable Double Life of a Notorious Serial Killer p. 88 as a method to lure her from her car as she studied in the college library.True Crime: Unsolved Crimes p. 6 The murder itself remains one of Riverside's most infamous cold casesAmerica's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer pp. 212-213 and has been described by some locals as a murder which \\"stripped Riverside of its innocence\\". Bates's murder became highly publicized due to both the graphic nature of her death, and the fact she is considered by some investigators to have been the first murder victim of the Zodiac Killer, although this theory has never been definitively confirmed.True Crime: Unsolved Crimes p. 8 Early life Cheri Josephine Bates was born in Omaha, Nebraska on February 4, 1948. She was the younger of two children born to Joseph and Irene Bates. The Bates family relocated to California in 1957, where her father found employment as a machinist at the Corona Naval Ordnance Laboratory. Bates was a graduate of Ramona High School, where she had been a varsity cheerleader,Co-ed Stabbed to Death on Riverside College Campus, Los Angeles Times, November 1, 1966, p. 3. active upon the student government, and an honor student. Described as a \\"sweet, outgoing girl\\" by acquaintances, she held aspirations to become a flight attendant.Evidence Links Zodiac Killer to '66 Death of Riverside Co-ed, Los Angeles Times, November 16, 1970, pg. A1. Following her graduation from Ramona High School, Bates enrolled at the Riverside City College (RCC) and found part-time employment at the Riverside National Bank.The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up: AKA: The Silenced Badge p. 56 Her savings, plus wages from this part-time employment, helped pay for a 1960 lime green Volkswagen Beetle,America's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer p. 213 a vehicle she was proud to own. Bates lived alone with her father at 4195 Via San Jose (her parents having divorced in 1965). Bates's mother also lived in Riverside, and her brother, Michael Bates, served in the United States Navy.The Cases That Haunt Us p. 163 Murder On the morning of October 30, 1966, Bates and her father attended Mass at the St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic Church before the two shared breakfast at a local restaurant.The Cases That Haunt Us p. 164 In the early afternoon, Bates opted to visit the college library to both study and to work on a research paper. She is known to have twice phoned a close friend of hers named Stephanie (at 3:00 and 3:45 p.m. respectively), asking whether she would like to accompany her to the college library to study and retrieve books, although on the occasion of the second phone call, her friend refused. Bates is believed to have left her house to visit the college library sometime between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. Her father returned home in the evening to find a note taped to the family refrigerator reading: \\"Dad—Went to RCC Library.\\" Shortly before Bates left her home, she phoned a co-worker at the Riverside National Bank, inquiring as to whether she had seen a term paper bibliography she (Bates) had misplaced. When her co-worker replied she had not, Bates replied: \\"Now I'll have to start all over on my note cards.\\" A subsequent eyewitness report given to Riverside investigators indicated Bates drove her Beetle in the direction of RCC at approximately 6:10 p.m. This eyewitness also claimed her vehicle was closely followed by a bronze 1965 or 1966 model Oldsmobile. According to many eyewitnesses, Bates studied in the library until the standard closing time of 9:00 p.m.True Crime: Unsolved Crimes p. 5 A subsequent witness statement obtained from a female RCC student given to investigators would claim that a young man whose age she estimated to be either 19 or 20 years old and approximately () in height had been lurking in shadows across the street from Bates's vehicle and had been staring in the direction of her car at around the standard closing time of the library. Although this witness did not know the individual lurking within shaded areas aside the street, as she had passed him, the two had exchanged brief pleasantries. Bates's father waited the entire night for his daughter to return home before filing a missing person report with Riverside police at 5:43 a.m. He filed this report after phoning Bates's close friend, Stephanie, in the early morning hours only to be informed that she (Bates) was not at her residence and had intended to study at the RCC library the previous evening, having held no plans to spend the evening away from home. At approximately 6:28 a.m. on the morning of October 31, a groundskeeper named Cleophus Martin discovered Bates's body on the grounds of RCC. Investigation Bates was found sprawled face down on a gravel path between two unoccupied houses on Terracina Drive, close to the library parking lot where she had parked her Beetle the previous evening. She was still dressed in a long-sleeve pale yellow print blouse and faded red capri pants and her woven straw bag—containing both her identification and 56 cents—lay alongside her body. Her clothing was undisturbed but was saturated in blood. She had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and left shoulder, and suffered several deep slash wounds to her face and neck.The Cases That Haunt Us pp. 163-164 Ten feet from Bates's body, investigators discovered a cheap, paint-spattered Timex brand wristwatch with a seven-inch circumference along with a footprint of a shoe produced by Leavenworth prisoners sold solely in military outlets. The shoe size was between eight and ten inches. Although only in height, Bates had been an athletic girl. Both an examination of the crime scene and Bates's subsequent autopsy revealed ample evidence of a ferocious physical struggle between Bates and her murderer; she having evidently scratched her assailant's arms, face and head and torn off his wristwatch. Bates's Beetle was parked just 75 yards east of the location where her body was discovered. The ignition wiring of the vehicle had been deliberately pulled loose but the ignition key was in place and both the driver's side and passenger window were rolled partly down. Three library books on the subject of United States government were lying on the front seat, and several smeared, greasy palm prints and fingerprints were found upon the vehicle. Investigators would determine these prints did not belong to Bates or any of her friends or relatives, and believe they may have belonged to her murderer.  Autopsy  An autopsy revealed Bates had been repeatedly kicked in the head in addition to having received two stab wounds to her chest inflicted by a knife estimated to be one-and-a-half-inches wide and three-and- a-half-inches in length. Her left cheek, upper lip, hands and arms had also been cut, with three slash wounds to her throat having severed her jugular vein and larynx and almost decapitating her. Bates had evidently lain upon the ground when she had received the knife wounds to her left shoulder blade and neck. Furthermore, she had not been subjected to any form of sexual assault or robbery within this attack. Numerous fragments of skin and brown hairAmerica's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer p. 229 were also recovered from beneath the fingernails of her right hand; this evidence having evidently been collected beneath her nails as she clawed at her assailant in a desperate effort to defend herself.True Crime: Unsolved Crimes pp. 5-6 The ground surrounding her body was described in her official autopsy report as \\"looking like a freshly plowed field.\\" On November 4, 1966, Bates was laid to rest at the Crestlawn Memorial Park in Riverside. Her parents, older brother and several hundred other mourners were present at this service.Zodiac: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer p. 103  Murder scenario  Within 24 hours of Bates's murder, investigators had interviewed 75 individuals, including numerous RCC students, and had begun interviewing military personnel stationed at the nearby March Air Force Base. By November 6, all but two of the individuals known to have been on the RCC campus had been traced and eliminated from the inquiry.Zodiac: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer p. 167 Investigators also received testimony from two separate individuals who had heard brief female screams emanating from the direction of Terracina Drive on the evening of the murder. From this, plus the conclusion of the coroner, investigators determined Bates had most likely been murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m. Investigations into her background could deduce no obvious motive for the killing, and revealed nothing which could classify her as an obvious or typical target for any form of revenge or random non-sexual violence.The Cases That Haunt Us p. 165 Investigators theorized Bates's murderer had likely disabled her vehicle before waiting for her to return from her studying within the college library on the night of her murder; they also believe the perpetrator likely surprised Bates after she had repeatedly attempted to start her car, before offering her assistance as an initial ruse to lure her from her vehicle before proceeding to attack her within a dimly lit section of Terracina Drive partly shielded from the view of potential witnesses by domestic shrubbery.The Encyclopedia of Undolved Crimes p. 321 At the time of discovery, both windows of Bates's Beetle were rolled down, and the keys of her vehicle were still in the ignition, thus meaning she had likely been forced from her vehicle to the scene of her murder while she stood aside or sat inside her vehicle.America's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer p. 225 At the initiative of Detective Sergeant David Bonine, a staged re-enactment of Bates's final hours studying within the RCC library was conducted nine days after her funeral in the hope of producing vital eyewitnesses.The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up: AKA: The Silenced Badge p. 253 Present at this re-enactment were 62 students, two librarians, and one custodian who had actually been in the library on the evening of October 30;Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killers Revealed p. 167 all of whom sat or stood where they had actually been on the evening in question. All participants who owned a vehicle were asked to park their car in precisely the same spot it had been on the evening of the murder, and all participants wore the same clothing they had on the evening in question. This initiative did bring forward numerous eyewitnesses, although no fruitful leads were gained. Nonetheless, several individuals stated they had seen a tan-gray Studebaker vehicle in the close vicinity of the RCC campus on the evening of October 30. Despite extensive appeals by both investigators and the local press, the owner of this vehicle was never traced. Correspondence One month after Bates's murder, two identical type-written letters arrived at Riverside police headquarters and the editorial offices of The Press-Enterprise. The author of these letters described in detail a likely scenario as to how Bates had been lured from her vehicle and subsequently murdered. This author described in detail how he had first disabled Bates's car before allegedly watching her repeatedly attempt to switch on the ignition until the vehicle battery had drained of power. He had then offered her assistance, claiming his own vehicle was further down the street; thus luring her away from her vehicle. According to the author of this letter, after the two had walked a short distance from her car, he had stated to her, \\"It's about time.\\" Bates had replied, \\"About time for what?\\" to which he had simply replied, \\"About time for you to die.\\"Zodiac: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer p. 169 According to the author, he had then clasped his hand over her mouth and pressed a knife against her neck before forcing her to walk to a dimly lit alley where he had proceeded to beat and kick Bates in their initial struggle before stabbing and slashing her to death.The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up: AKA: The Silenced Badge p. 191 The author of these letters claimed to have known his victim, proclaiming: \\"Only one thing was on my mind: Making her pay for the brush-offs that she had given me during the years prior.\\" Due to the fact the letter included details of the murder which had not been released to the press—including the fact the ignition coil and middle wire of the distributor of Bates's vehicle had been disabled—investigators initially believed that the author of the letter may have been the actual murderer,True Crime: Unsolved Crimes pp. 6-7 although later advances in forensic technology such as the DNA retrieved from this letter not matching the actual DNA retrieved from beneath Bates's fingernails make an unlikely possibility the author of the letter could have been the actual perpetrator of the crime.America's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer p. 218America's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer p. 226 On April 30, 1967, The Press- Enterprise printed a further update on Bates's murder. The following day, both the police and Bates's father received handwritten letters from an unknown individual, who had scrawled the message \\"Bates had to die. There will be more\\" on a single sheet of paper.The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes p. 321 This letter was also considered by police to have been a distasteful hoax, although at the bottom of each letter was an indecipherable number or letter which was either a \\"2\\" or a \\"Z\\". Potential link to Zodiac Killer It has been hypothesized that Bates may have been an early victim—perhaps the first victim—of an unidentified serial killer active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s known as the Zodiac Killer, and that this unidentified individual may have originated from Riverside and later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area.The inscription upon the Riverside City College library desk, discovered in 1967. One of the potential clues supporting this theory was the discovery of a set of lower case initials (r h) inscribed below a macabre poem scratched into a desk at RCC. This poem was discovered by a custodian six months after Bates's murder, and contains graphic references to repeated assaults upon young women with a bladed weapon. The desk in question was in the college storage area at the time the poem was discovered, although the custodian informed police the desk had been on the library floor at the time of Bates's murder. Police photographed the inscription and added this piece of circumstantial evidence to the case file. Furthermore, the fact the perpetrator subsequently sent correspondence to the police and press, including details of the murder withheld from the public, is reminiscent of the Zodiac Killer.America's Jack The Ripper: The Crimes and Psychology of the Zodiac Killer p. 217 In addition, Riverside police have also noted similarities between Bates's slaying and the general modus operandi of a fatal attack upon a young couple committed at Lake Berryessa in September 1969—an attack conclusively ascribed to the Zodiac Killer.Zodiac Tie To Riverside Slaying Confirmed, Los Angeles Times, November 17, 1970, p. A1. San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery followed the series of murders committed by the Zodiac Killer from the date of the perpetrator's first definite murders. In November 1970, Avery received a letter from an anonymous source informing him of the similarities between the murders committed by the Zodiac Killer and the murder of Bates four years previously. The letter urged Avery to investigate the similarities in greater detail.True Crime: Unsolved Crimes p. 40 Although Riverside police remained unconvinced of his conclusions, both Avery and a handwriting expert named Sherwood MorrillThe Hunt for Zodiac: The Inconceivable Double Life of a Notorious Serial Killer p. 59 stated on November 16 that the handwriting scratched on the desk at RCC and the letters sent to The Press-Enterprise and Bates's father in 1967 were \\"unquestionably\\" written by the same individual who had later written the Zodiac letters. By this date, the Zodiac Killer claimed to have killed fourteen victims, although only five murders and two attempted murders committed between December 1968 and October 1969 have ever been conclusively attributed to this individual.One Was Not Enough p. 176-179 In a letter dated March 13, 1971, the Zodiac Killer penned a letter to the Los Angeles Times in which he claimed to be responsible for the murder of Bates, stating: \\"I do have to give [the police] credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones. There are a hell of a lot more down there.\\"The Zodiac Killer: Terror in California p. 40 Alternative theories Former Los Angeles police investigator Steve Hodel, in his book Most Evil, has claimed that his father, George Hodel, was responsible for the murder of Bates.Most Evil (Avenger, Zodiac, and the Further Serial Murders of Dr. George Hill Hodel), Steve Hodel with Ralph Pezullo, E.P. Dutton, New York, New York, September 2009, pp. 110 - 119. This claim has been viewed with little credibility, not least because—among other cases—Hodel has also claimed that his father was the Zodiac Killer, Lipstick Killer, and the perpetrator of the 1947 murder of the Black Dahlia. Aftermath Officially, Bates's murder remains an unsolved case, and the theory she was a victim of the Zodiac Killer (which has been strongly disputed by the Riverside police) has never been proven. Despite several suspects having been investigated and eliminated from the inquiry since 1966, the current investigator assigned to the case, Detective Jim Simons, has stated one individual still remains of interest to the investigation, although because tests conducted upon the mitochondrial DNA of the hair and blood samples found at the crime scene did not match those of this suspect, insufficient physical evidence exists to link this individual to the crime. Investigators who conducted DNA profiling were, however, able to determine that her murderer was a Caucasian male. Following the murder, Bates's family established a memorial scholarship at RCC. This scholarship, entitled The Cheri Jo Bates Memorial Endowed Scholarship, is awarded to a student active in various school projects and initiatives, who demonstrates financial needs, undertakes volunteer work, and who majors in music with a B grade average.

Examples of such laws include special Jewish quotas, Jewish taxes and Jewish \\"disabilities\\". Some were adopted in the 1930s and 1940s in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and exported to the European Axis powers and puppet states. Such legislation generally defined Jews, deprived them of a variety of civil, political, and economic rights, and laid the groundwork for expropriation, deportation, and ultimately the Holocaust. Nazi Germany 1935 chart used to explain the Nuremberg Laws The 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service excluded all \\"non-Aryans\\", including those who had even just one Jewish grandparent (in contrast to the way the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 regarded such people, as \\"quarter-Jews (\\"Vierteljuden\\")) from the civil service. In 1935, the Nazis passed the Nuremberg Laws which forbid Jews from citizenship and prohibited sexual relations and marriages between Jews and \\"Aryans\\". The total number of laws against Jews reached 400 since the end of the war. The issuing of laws begun in 1933, with 80 until the Nuremberg Laws, and the other decrees were issued against the Jews after the Nuremberg Laws. Fascist Italy The Manifesto of Race published on July 14, 1938, prepared for the enactment of racial laws to be introduced. The Italian Racial Laws were passed on November 18, 1938, excluding Jews from the civil service, the armed forces, and the National Fascist Party, and restricting Jewish ownership of certain companies and property; intermarriage was also prohibited.Morley, 1980, p. 167. The legislation remained in effect after the fall of Mussolini for the first months of the Badoglio government,Morley, 1980, p. 178. before being repealed on January 20, 1944. Poland The Second Polish Republic, from the 1920s the Polish government excluded Jews from receiving government bank credits, public sector employment, and obtaining business licenses. From the 1930s limits were placed on Jewish enrollment in university education, Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, Shechita, Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations, etc. While in 1921-22 25% of students were Jews, by 1938-9 the proportion went down to 8%. The far- right National Democracy (Endeks) organized anti-Jewish boycotts. Following the death of Poland's ruler Józef Piłsudski in 1935, the Endeks intensified their efforts which lead to violence in a few cases pogroms in smaller towns. In 1937 the Endeks passed resolutions that \\"its main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland\\". The government in response organized the Camp of National Unity (OZON), which in 1938 took control of the Polish parliament. The Polish parliament then drafted anti-Jewish legislation similar to anti-Jewish laws in Germany, Hungary, and Romania. OZON advocated mass emigration of Jews from Poland, boycott of Jews, numerus clausus (see also Ghetto benches), and other limitation on Jewish rights. According to William W. Hagen by 1939, prior to the war, Polish Jews were threatened with conditions similar to those in Nazi Germany.Hagen, William W. \\"Before the\\" final solution\\": Toward a comparative analysis of political anti-Semitism in interwar Germany and Poland.\\" The Journal of Modern History 68.2 (1996): 351-381. Slovak State The Slovak State passed its first racial legislation on April 18, 1939, defining Jews as including religious Jews, and any Jews baptized after October 30, 1918.Morley, 1980, p. 74. According to Morley, \\"the Jewish Code was promulgated on September 9, 1941, without the approval of the Slovak parliament or the signature of Tiso\\".Morley, 1980, p. 75. The Slovak parliament on May 15, 1942, retroactively legalized the deportations, deprivation of Jewish citizenship, and expropriation of property that had occurred.Morley, 1980, p. 86.  Hungary  Hungary passed laws on 28 May 1938 and 5 May 1939 banning Jews (defined primarily by official religion; e.g. practising Judaism) from various professions. A third law, added in August 1941, defined Jews practically as anyone with at least two Jewish grandparents - exempted those who were born Christian and their parents had been as well the time of their marriage, etc. - and forbade sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non-Jews. Romania In August 1940, the Romanian government passed legislation that Jews who converted to Christianity would be regarded as Jews for legal purposes, and barred from marriage with ethnic Christians; by defining Jews not based on religion this was \\"the first step, and a large one at that, to further racial legislation\\".Morley, 1980, p. 25. Vichy France France passed its Statute on Jews in October 1940. Similar legislation was adopted later that year in the French possessions of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Bulgaria Bulgaria passed its anti-Jewish code, the Law for protection of the nation, in 1941. Independent State of Croatia The Independent State of Croatia issued a definition of Jews on April 30, 1941, laying the groundwork for expropriation and forced labor, followed by deportations.Morley, 1980, p. 148. Empire of Japan Imperial Japan never issued legislation specifically targeting Jews, however they were still subject to Japanese persecution in countries occupied by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, such as Indonesia and Singapore.

He was President of the American Medical Association, and served Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee during the American Civil War. He was a graduate of the George Washington University Medical School. Early life Alexander Yelverton Peyron Garnett was born in essex country, September 19th, 1820. He was the son of Muscoe Garnett and Maria Battile, his wife. Among ancestry were many of the best known old families of Virginia. His childhood was spent at his home, and his education conducted under private tutors. Biography Garnett began studying medicine at the University of Pennsylvania at the age of nineteen, and graduated in 1842. After graduation, he was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Navy. His first cruise was to the Pacific, under Commodore Cornelius Stribling, on the American steamer USS Cyane. On a subsequent cruise to South America, he met his wife, Mary Wise, daughter of then United States Minister to the Court of Brazil, Henry A. Wise. After his marriage he was stationed temporarily at Washington, but later resigned his position in the Navy and began his career as a civilian physician. He was then elected to the chair of Theory and Practice of Medicine in the National Medical College of Columbian University. At the outbreak of the American Civil War his sympathies were with his native state of Virginia; he left Washington for Richmond, Virginia, where he remained until the close of the war. So many of his friends and former patients were in this city that he very soon found himself actively engaged in as large a practice as he had had in Washington. Dr. Garnett was appointed surgeon in the Confederate Army, and placed in charge of two hospitals. He was also a member of the Board of Medical Examiners to examine applicants for admission to the Medical Corps. These positions he continued to hold during the entire war. He was the physician of General Robert E. Lee and family, as well as to the families of Generals Joe Johnston, Wade Hampton, William Preston Johnston, John C. Breckinridge, and of many members of the Confederate Cabinet and Congress. At the termination of the war in 1865, when Richmond was evacuated, Dr. Garnett, at the request of Jefferson Davis, accompanied him as a member of his personal staff, but after the surrender of Johnston's army he returned to Richmond a paroled prisoner. He resumed the practice of his profession in Richmond, but in 1865 returned to Washington where he immediately found himself engaged in active practice and in lecturing. He was elected to the chair of Clinical Medicine in the Medical Department of Columbian University, which position he held for many years. He also became one of the Board of Directors of the Children's Hospital, and served as President of the Medical Society and of the Medical Association of the District of Columbia. In 1874, he was chosen President of the Southern Memorial Association of Washington, and selected to deliver the oration upon the occasion of the interring of the dead of Early's army, who had fallen in the attack upon Washington. His address upon that occasion was conciliatory in its tone.http://allenbrowne.blogspot.com/2011/06/confederate-monument.html Dr. Garnett was elected President of the American Medical Association, and presided at its meeting in 1886. His address on medical education excited a great deal of notice and approval at the time, as he brought into very broad relief the evils of medical education in this country. His last public work was in connection with the meeting of the International Medical Congress, held in Washington in 1887. It is well known how many obstacles and difficulties attended the completing of the arrangements for that meeting and it was only by dint of most arduous labor and untiring energy that Dr. Garnett, as Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements, gave it so large a measure of success. There is no doubt that the anxiety of mind and physical fatigue attendant upon his duties at this time helped to bring on the death of Dr. A. Y. P. Garnett, a failure of health which ended in his sudden death in the summer of 1888 at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Works Dr. Garnett contributed a number of papers to medical journals, which were all of great practical value and interest. The paper which he read at the meeting of this Society, in 1887, entitled “Observations on the Sanitary Advantages of Tide Water Virginia” is a fair example of his thoroughness in the treatment of medical questions. Other papers are: *“Condurango as a Cure for Cancer” *“The Potomac Marshes and their Influence as a Pathogenic Agent” *“Epidemic Jaundice among Children” *“The Sorghum Vulgare or Broom-Corn, Seed in Cystitis” *“Nelaton's Probe in Gunshot Wounds” *“Coloproctitis treated by Hot-Water Douche and Dilatation or Division of the Sphincters” Notes References  External links * A Letter from AYP Garnett * Letters to and from AYP Garnett Category:1820 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Physicians from Virginia Category:People from Essex County, Virginia Category:Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:George Washington University faculty Category:People of Virginia in the American Civil War Category:George Washington University Medical School alumni ","title":"A.Y.P.

It was the first news organization specializing on Italian science daily.About MolecularLab.it. Retrieved on 23-06-2008. One of the features of this site has been the intensive use of systems for distribution of news: custom feeds to be updated on certain categories or topics,One implementation of the RSS service, dated 13 December 2004. News Ticker and widgets to spread to other sites, an ICS file to sync with the events reported by MolecularLab, and other tools as plugins to search the site by the browser. Since January 2006Partnership MolecularLab and WorldCommunityGrid MolecularLab is in partnership with World Community Grid to promote the use of computers in biomedical research. During the first years, the comments associated to the news were free making it possible for users to open discussions of interest. From 2007, comments were moderated and limited to registered users. Later a multimedia section, a directory science, a section for beginners, and a glossary were added. The last section consists of a quiz. The newspaper, now owned by Richard Fallini, works with the European information system CORDIS and the association for consumers Aduc, receives press releases from the major Italian research institutions, and operates through some researchers to the first scientific blog network in Italy.The announcement of the creation of Inside Blogs References External links *MolecularLab, official website (home page) *Community Site *Blog Site Category:Biotechnology Category:Italian science websites ","title":"MolecularLab"},{"id":"24704622","text":"Chuanying District () is a district of Jilin City, Jilin, People's Republic of China.

Life He was the son of the Rev. John Benson, rector of Cradley, Herefordshire, and was born there on 23 April 1689. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Christ Church, Oxford, of which he became a tutor; he matriculated in 1706, graduated B.A. in 1712 and M.A. in 1713. He subsequently travelled on the continent, where he met George Berkeley, his friend and correspondent for thirty years, and Thomas Secker, whose sister he married. Soon after his return he became, in 1721, archdeacon of Berkshire. In 1724 he obtained one of the 'golden' prebends in Durham Cathedral; and in 1726 was made chaplain to the Prince of Wales. In 1727 he was presented to the rectory of Bletchley, and in 1728, on occasion of a royal visit to Cambridge, received the degree of D.D. In January 1735 he was nominated bishop of Gloucester; his friend and patron Lord Chancellor Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot suffered the rejection of his previous nominee Thomas Rundle, whose promotion to Gloucester had been successfully opposed by Edmund Gibson, the Bishop of London. On his appointment Benson declared his resolution to accept no higher preferment. He revived the institution of rural deans, repaved the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, added pinnacles to the lady chapel, and repaired the palace. He visited the diocese of York, under commission from the aging Archbishop Lancelot Blackburne, who left him a service of plate by his will. He tended Bishop Joseph Butler in his last illness, died a few months later on 30 August 1752, and was buried in his cathedral. Alexander Pope celebrated him along with his friend Berkeley in the couplet: :Manners with candour are to Benson given, :To Berkeley every virtue under heaven. His only publications were some separate sermons.

Located around west of Wigtown on the Machars peninsula, it is in the parish of Mochrum in the traditional county of Wigtownshire. The plantation was purchased from the Forestry Commission by the Tinne Beag Workers’ Co-operative in 1999 and since then the co-operative has been managing the woodland for sustainable use of both timber and non-timber forest products, while increasing biodiversity and restoring native vegetation types where possible.  Woodland  The woodland comprises of sitka spruce plantation with a substantial area of semi-natural deciduous woodland of oak, ash, beech, birch, Scots pine, willow, alder, and sycamore. There is also of peat bog wetland that was clear-felled around 1998. It is being regenerated with birch, rowan, willow and oak. Within the sitka there are many wetland glades of derelict alder coppice and areas containing a variety of sphagnums.  Hill fort  The Doon of May plantation takes its name from a vitrified Iron Age hill fort on the south-west of the plantation. The fort is some above sea level and provides views of Luce Bay with the coast of Ireland in the distance. The fort, also described as a walled settlement, is roughly elliptical, measuring east to west by north to south. The surrounding wall is up to on the south side, and the entrance was probably from the west. The facing stones of the heavily vitrified wall have almost entirely gone. Natural cliffs enhance the defensive nature of the site, and no evidence survives of outer defences. The Doon of May is a scheduled monument.  Boundaries  The northern boundary of the woodland is formed by the south edge of Mochrum Loch, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, hosting Britain's largest inland nesting colony of cormorants. The woodland is adjacent to part of the Sustrans National Cycle Network. A Peace Pole has been erected at the eastern side of the public road which passes through the plantation.

It was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and directed by Eisenberg. It originally aired on October 22, 2009 on NBC. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Jim and Pam return from their honeymoon and discover that Michael is dating Pam's mother, which infuriates her. Meanwhile, Dwight tries to install a recording device in Jim's office, by giving him a wooden mallard as an apology for their long rivalry. Synopsis Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) return from their honeymoon in Puerto Rico and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tells Jim that he has been dating Pam's mother, Helene (Linda Purl), after spending the night with her at their wedding in Niagara. Jim is shocked and tells Michael not to mention anything to Pam (which he reluctantly agrees to do) and to break it off with Helene immediately (which he does not agree to). However, when Jim and Pam give Michael a gift from Puerto Rico, Michael asks if Pam thinks he should date who he wants. He then lets it slip he is dating Helene, and Pam storms out of the office and into the parking lot, screaming all the way down. She calls her mother and angrily asks her why she started dating him after her mother continuously complained to her about Michael's behavior over the past several years. During a conference room meeting, Pam maintains a hostile attitude toward Michael and openly defies him in response to the news. Michael then gets a call from Helene, who wants him to tell Pam to calm down. Pam then announces that he has been dating Helene to the rest of the office. Everyone is initially disgusted by this, but Michael appeals to them with his human need for companionship, and they agree that Pam is overreacting. In response, Pam becomes hostile towards the rest of the office. Michael complains to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about Pam's behavior, but when Toby tries to coax Pam into discussing the issue, she becomes angry with Toby as well. Pam brings Michael into the kitchen and orders him to stop dating Helene, and Michael responds by saying he will \\"start dating her even harder.\\" At the end of the day, Michael feels bad and says goodnight to Pam, without response. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) apologizes to Jim for their feuds, and offers him a token of his desire for peace with a wooden mallard, actually a concealed recording device which he means to use to gather damaging information about Jim. Jim quickly finds the device and starts using it to prank Dwight. He brings Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) into his office and plays \\"M'Appari\\" from the opera Martha loudly while he talks to Andy so Dwight will not hear their conversation, while using gestures to make it clear that they are discussing Dwight. He then gives the mallard to Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) in the annex, meaning Dwight can hear the couple's bickering, and is forced to pay $10 to get it back. Jim finally summons Dwight to his office and tells him he knew about the recording device all along. Dwight admits to being jealous of Jim's promotion. Jim tells Dwight to wash his car as punishment, which Dwight agrees is fair. Jim then brings Pam into the conference room and cheers her up by saying Dwight is washing their car out of sympathy for what she has been through and recounting stories from their honeymoon. At the end of the episode, Dwight reveals that that recording device underneath the mallard was a decoy, and his primary recording device was installed on the tip of a pen that he claimed Jim left on his desk earlier, along with the mallard. Dwight explains he would never put his primary listening device in such an obvious place, as he is \\"not insane.\\" Reception This episode was watched by 8.5 million viewers, with a 4.2 rating and an 11 share in the 18–49 demographic.

She was the prime benefactor of Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet in Gothenburg, Sweden. Biography Margareta Huitfeldt was born at the Skjelbred farm in the parish of Fiskum in the district of Eiker in Buskerud, Norway. She was the only child of the Danish noble Hartvig Andersen Huitfeldt (1582-1637) and Norwegian noble Bente Jonsdotter Schack (ca.1594-1622). In 1635, she married Danish noble Thomas Iverssön Dyre (1605–1651). Of their three children, only their son Iver Dyre (1644-1663) lived past infancy. She became one of the greatest land owners in Scandinavia as the heir of her parents and her spouse. Most of her properties were situated in Bohuslän, at that time a province of Norway. Her principal holdings included Skjelbred in Eiker and her residence Sundsby Manor (Sundsby säteri) in Bohuslän. Sundsby is located on the island of Mjörn in the parish of Valla in Bohuslän. She had inherited the property in 1625 following the death of her relative, Norwegian Chancellor Anders Lauritsson Green (ca. 1550-1614). She and her husband further expanded the estate through purchase of adjacent property and built an extensive estate complex. With time, her holdings came to include properties in Skee parish at Fiskebäckskil, at Åby and on Hisingen as well as sizable portions of Tjörn. Legacy Her husband Thomas Dyre died during 1651 and her surviving son Iver Dyre in 1663. Margareta Huitfeldt died during 1683 and was buried at Valla Church. Following the death of her son, she had made a notable donation providing payment for the schooling of students from Bohuslän. Upon her own death, her estate was put under the protection of the Swedish Crown. Her will included a legacy for Valla Church. Her will provided for the larger part of her estate to be donated to Göteborgs gymnasium in Gothenburg which Queen Kristina of Sweden had originally founded in 1647. The school would later be renamed Hvitfeldtska gymnasiet in her honor. References  Other sources  * Beata Losman (1984) Margareta Huitfeldt.

It first appeared as an abstract published in Archives générales de médecineDuchenne in 1862 and was then published in three formats: two octavo editions and one quarto edition. The work was an important resource used by Charles Darwin (1809–82) for his own study on the genetics of behaviour, entitled The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals,Darwin but in recent years it has been reclaimed as an important landmark in the history of the photographic arts. Overview Duchenne and his patient, an \\"old toothless man, with a thin face, whose features, without being absolutely ugly, approached ordinary triviality\\" Influenced by the fashionable beliefs of Physiognomy of the 19th century, Duchenne wanted to determine how the muscles in the human face produce facial expressions which he believed to be directly linked to the soul of man. He is known, in particular, for the way he triggered muscular contractions with electrical probes, recording the resulting distorted and often grotesque expressions with the recently invented camera. He published his findings during 1862, together with extraordinary photographs of the induced expressions, in the book The Mechanism of Human Physiognomy (Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine). Like physiognomists and phrenologists before him, Duchenne believed that the human face was a map the features of which could be codified into universal taxonomies of inner states; he was convinced that the expressions of the human face were a gateway to the soul of man. Unlike Lavater and other physiognomists of the era, Duchenne was skeptical of the face's ability to express moral character; rather he was convinced that it was through a reading of the expressions alone (known as pathognomy) which could reveal an \\"accurate rendering of the soul's emotions\\".Duchenne, Mecanisme, part 3, 130-1, trans. Sobieszek. He believed that he could observe and capture an \\"idealized naturalism\\" in a similar (and even improved) way to that observed in Greek art. It is these notions that he sought conclusively and scientifically to chart by his experiments and photography and it led to the publishing of The Mechanism of Human Physiognomy during 1862Also known as The publication history of Duchenne's Mecanisme is complex and to a degree uncertain. It was published during 1862 and possibly into 1863. (also entitled, The Electro-Physiological Analysis of the Expression of the Passions, Applicable to the Practice of the Plastic Arts. in French: Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine, ou Analyse électro-physiologique de l'expression des passions applicable à la pratique des arts plastiques). The work compromises a volume of text divided into three parts: # General considerations # A scientific section # An aesthetic section These sections were accompanied by an atlas of photographic plates. Believing that he was investigating a God-given language of facial signs, Duchenne writes: > In the face our creator was not concerned with mechanical necessity. He was > able in his wisdom or – please pardon this manner of speaking – in pursuing > a divine fantasy … to put any particular muscles into action, one alone or > several muscles together, when He wished the characteristic signs of the > emotions, even the most fleeting, to be written briefly on man's face. Once > this language of facial expression was created, it sufficed for Him to give > all human beings the instinctive faculty of always expressing their > sentiments by contracting the same muscles. This rendered the language > universal and immutable Duchenne, Mecanisme, part I, 31; Cuthbertson trans., > 19. Duchenne defines the fundamental expressive gestures of the human face and associates each with a specific facial muscle or muscle group. He identifies thirteen primary emotions the expression of which is controlled by one or two muscles. He also isolates the precise contractions that result in each expression and separates them into two categories: partial and combined. To stimulate the facial muscles and capture these \\"idealized\\" expressions of his patients, Duchenne applied faradic shock through electrified metal probes pressed upon the surface of the various muscles of the face. Duchenne patient, photo from Houghton Library, Harvard University TypPh 815.62.3402 (A) Duchenne was convinced that the \\"truth\\" of his pathognomic experiments could only be effectively rendered by photography, the subject's expressions being too fleeting to be drawn or painted. \\"Only photography,\\" he writes, \\"as truthful as a mirror, could attain such desirable perfection.\\"Duchenne, Mecanisme, part I, 65; Cuthbertson trans., 36. He worked with a talented, young photographer, Adrian Tournachon, (the brother of Felix Nadar), and also taught himself the art in order to document his experiments.Although Tournachon contributed some of the negatives for the scientific section, most of the photographs of this section, and all eleven plates corresponding to the aesthetic section, were done by Duchenne. From an art-historical point of view, the Mechanism of Human Physiognomy was the first publication on the expression of human emotions to be illustrated with actual photographs. Photography had only been invented recently, and there was a widespread belief that this was a medium that could capture the \\"truth\\" of any situation in a way that other mediums were unable to do. Duchenne used six living models in the scientific section, all but one of whom were his patients. His primary model, however, was an \\"old toothless man, with a thin face, whose features, without being absolutely ugly, approached ordinary triviality.\\"Duchenne, Mechanism, part 2, 6; Cuthbertson trans., 42 Through his experiments, Duchenne sought to capture the very \\"conditions that aesthetically constitute beauty.\\"Duchenne, Mecanisme, part 2, 8; Cuthbertson trans., 43. He reiterated this in the aesthetic section of the book where he spoke of his desire to portray the \\"conditions of beauty: beauty of form associated with the exactness of the facial expression, pose and gesture.\\"Duchenne, Mecanisme, part 3, 133; Cuthbertson trans., 102 Duchenne referred to these facial expressions as the \\"gymnastics of the soul\\". He replied to criticisms of his use of the old man by arguing that \\"every face could become spiritually beautiful through the accurate rendering of his or her emotions\\", and furthermore said that because the patient was suffering from an anesthetic condition of the face, he could experiment upon the muscles of his face without causing him pain. Aesthetics and narrative setting G.-B. Duchanne de Boulogne, Synoptic plate 4 from Le Mécanisme de la Physionomie Humaine. 1862, albumen print. In the upper row and the lower two rows, patients with different expressions on either side of their faces Whereas the scientific section was intended to exhibit the expressive lines of the face and the \\"truth of the expression,\\" the aesthetic section was intended also to demonstrate that the \\"gesture and the pose together contribute to the expression; the trunk and the limbs must be photographed with as much care as the face so as to form an harmonious whole.\\"Duchenne, Mecanisme, part 3, 133-5; Cuthbertson trans., 102-3 For these plates Duchenne used a partially blind young woman who he claimed \\"had become accustomed to the unpleasant sensation of this treatment …\\".Duchenne, Mecanisme, part 3, 141; Cuthbertson trans., 105 As in many of the plates for the scientific section, this model was also stimulated faradically to provoke a different expression on either side of her face. Duchenne advised that looking at both sides of the face simultaneously would reveal only a \\"mere grimace\\" and he urged the reader to examine each side separately and with care. Duchenne's experiments for the aesthetic section of the Mechanism included the use of performance and narratives which may well have been influenced by gestures and poses found in the pantomime of the period. He believed that only by electroshock and in the setting of elaborately constructed theatre pieces featuring gestures and accessory symbols could he faithfully depict the complex combinatory expressions resulting from conflicting emotions and ambivalent sentiments. These melodramatic tableaux include a nun in \\"extremely sorrowful prayer\\" experiencing \\"saintly transports of virginal purity\\"; a mother feeling both pain and joy while leaning over a child's crib; a bare-shouldered coquette looking at once offended, haughty and mocking; and three scenes from Lady Macbeth expressing the \\"aggressive and wicked passions of hatred, of jealousy, of cruel instincts,\\" modulated to varying degrees of contrary feelings of filial piety.Duchenne, Mecanisme, part 3, 169-74; Cuthbertson trans., 120-2 This theatre of pathognomic effect dominates the aesthetic section of the Mecanisme. Beauty and truth To help him locate and identify the facial muscles, Duchenne drew heavily upon the work of Charles Bell, although he did not share the Scottish anatomist's interest in the expressions found in insanity. Duchenne may have avoided photographing the \\"passions\\" of the insane because of technical problems at the time; however, it is much more likely that he did so for aesthetic reasons – simply, that he did not regard the expressions of the insane as socially acceptable. Charles Bell's writings also showed an instinctive revulsion for the mentally ill. The exact imitation of nature was for Duchenne the sine qua non of the finest art of whatever age, and although he praised the ancient Greek sculptors for unquestionably attaining an ideal of beauty, he nevertheless criticized them for their anatomical errors and failure to attend to the emotions. Thus at the end of the scientific section, for instance, Duchenne \\"corrects\\" the expressions of three widely revered classic Greek or Roman antiquities: In no manner, argues Duchenne, do any of these countenances conform to nature as revealed by his electrophysiological research. He even questions the Greek artist Praxiteles's accuracy in sculpting the Niobe: > Would Niobe have been less beautiful if the dreadful emotion of her spirit > had bulged the head of her oblique eyebrow as nature does, and if a few > lines of sorrow had furrowed the median section of her forehead? On the > contrary, nothing is more moving and appealing than such an expression of > pain on a young forehead, which is usually so serene.Duchenne, Mecanisme, > part 2, 125; Cuthbertson trans., 100.

He was honorably discharged from the 94th Aero Squadron on 2 Jun 1919 and assumed command of the 147th Aero Squadron on 18 Sep 1919. On 26 Dec 1919 Cook was relieved of command of 147th Aero Squadron and honorably discharged. Cook and Rickenbacker became friends, known to each other as \\"Weird\\" and \\"Rick.\\" Both were strong proponents of more adequate training for rookie combat pilots, having themselves benefited from aerial combat training by Lafayette Escadrille veteran Raoul Lufbery and others. Between the wars After World War I, Cook helped to form the U.S. Army’s U.S. Air Mail Service and was one of the first transcontinental airmail pilots. Cook spent only a few months (from August 23, 1920 until December 8, 1920) in the airmail service. During that time, he was assigned for three months to the Western Division. After flying the Rock Springs to Salt Lake City route, he called those 150 miles \\"the rottenest stretch of territory in the country.\\" He also served with the civilian aviation industry in multiple duties such as working on the Hoffman cabin-chute for passenger transport airplanes. Cook’s 1926 air race pilot license was signed by friend and cohort Orville Wright. He had a continued affiliation with the Indiana National Guard serving as their air officer. He resigned his Army commission in 1928 to become vice president and general manager of the Curtis Flying Service of Indiana, located in at Stout Army Air Field in Indianapolis. Cook was a pioneer in bringing Indianapolis its first principal airport, Indianapolis Municipal Airport which opened in Indianapolis in 1931. Construction cost $724,000, and the airport terminal building was completed for $125,000. Later in Indianapolis, he was involved in the development of the first dive bombing sight for the United States Army. He fought for military recognition of the airplanes’ potential and was part of the group of officers who “lost favor” with the Army during the court martial of General Billy Mitchell. Cook served for many years as director and vice president of the American Legion National Aeronautics Commission in Indianapolis and was later the first American Legion National Director of Aviation. Cook became involved in recognizing the Wright Brothers’ contributions to flying. The Smithsonian did not recognize the brother’s flight at “Kitty Hawk” in 1903 as the first powered aircraft flight. Due to his dogged determination, the flight was eventually officially recognized in 1940 as the first powered flight. Weir Cook was a member of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Airport Siting Committee, which picked the site for the Indianapolis airport. The airport opened in 1931 and Cook was the airport’s first manager. World War II After December 7, 1941, Cook achieved the rank of colonel in the 38th Division of the Indiana Air Guard located in Indianapolis. Early in 1941, after intensely lobbying for an assignment to the front lines, Cook went back into the Army Air Corps service as a procurement officer and became the commander of air bases in New Caledonia. Cook died in New Caledonia on March 24, 1943, in an airplane crash while training young pilots for combat. Colonel Cook left his base, Oua Tom airbase piloting a Bell P-39 Airacobra in order to find and to bomb a reported submarine. While hunting for the submarine, Cook misjudged his altitude because of cloudy weather and struck the side of a mountain (Ouassio Hill) crashing to his death. He is buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Section O, Grave 440. In his honor, the Indianapolis Municipal Airport was renamed Weir Cook Municipal Airport and in 1944 a Liberty ship was named H. Weir Cook. In 1976, Weir Cook Municipal Airport was renamed Indianapolis International Airport, but due to the outcry by veterans' groups, the newly constructed terminal building of the airport was named after him on October 28, 2008.

The term is commonly used to denote the Age of Enlightenment, but is also used in Western cultures in a religious context. It translates several Buddhist terms and concepts, most notably bodhi, kensho and satori. Related terms from Asian religions are moksha (liberation) in Hinduism, Kevala Jnana in Jainism, and ushta in Zoroastrianism. In Christianity, the word \\"enlightenment\\" is rarely used, except to refer to the Age of Enlightenment and its influence on Christianity. Roughly equivalent terms in Christianity may be illumination, kenosis, metanoia, revelation, salvation and conversion. Perennialists and Universalists view enlightenment and mysticism as equivalent terms for religious or spiritual insight. Lord Mahavira attaining enlightenment. Asian cultures and religions Buddhism The English term enlightenment is the western translation of the abstract noun bodhi, the knowledge or wisdom, or awakened intellect, of a Buddha. The verbal root budh- means \\"to awaken,\\" and its literal meaning is closer to \\"awakening.\\" Although its most common usage is in the context of Buddhism, the term buddhi is also used in other Indian philosophies and traditions. The term \\"enlightenment\\" was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of Max Müller. It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth or reality. The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts, which are used to denote insight (prajna, kensho and satori); knowledge (vidhya); the \\"blowing out\\" (Nirvana) of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release (vimutti); and the attainment of Buddhahood, as exemplified by Gautama Buddha. What exactly constituted the Buddha's awakening is unknown. It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and dhyāna, applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving. The relation between dhyana and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism, and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice. In the western world the concept of spiritual enlightenment has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self and false self, being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning., , , Hinduism In Indian religions moksha (Sanskrit: '; liberation) or mukti (Sanskrit: ; release —both from the root ' \\"to let loose, let go\\") is the final extrication of the soul or consciousness (purusha) from samsara and the bringing to an end of all the suffering involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and rebirth (reincarnation). Advaita Vedanta Advaita Vedanta (IAST '; Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त ) is a philosophical concept where followers seek liberation/release by recognizing identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman) through long preparation and training, usually under the guidance of a guru, that involves efforts such as knowledge of scriptures, renunciation of worldly activities, and inducement of direct identity experiences. Originating in India before 788 AD, Advaita Vedanta is widely considered the most influential and most dominantGandhi And Mahayana Buddhism, Journal of Oriental Studies 35:2 (1996), pp. 84-105 (accessdate=2011-06-10) sub-school of the Vedānta (literally, end or the goal of the Vedas, Sanskrit) school of Hindu philosophy. Other major sub-schools of Vedānta are ' and Dvaita; while the minor ones include Suddhadvaita, Dvaitadvaita and Achintya Bhedabheda. Advaita (literally, non-duality) is a system of thought where \\"Advaita\\" refers to the identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman). Recognition of this identity leads to liberation. Attaining this liberation supposedly takes a long preparation and training under the guidance of a guru, however Ramana Maharshi called his death experience akrama mukti, \\"sudden liberation\\", as opposed to the krama mukti, \\"gradual liberation\\" as in the Vedanta path of Jnana yoga. The key source texts for all schools of Vedānta are the Prasthanatrayi—the canonical texts consisting of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma Sutras. The first person to explicitly consolidate the principles of Advaita Vedanta was Shankara Bhagavadpada, while the first historical proponent was Gaudapada, the guru of Shankara's guru Govinda Bhagavatpada. =Philosophical system= Shankara systematized the works of preceding philosophers. His system of Vedanta introduced the method of scholarly exegesis on the accepted metaphysics of the Upanishads. This style was adopted by all the later Vedanta schools. Shankara's synthesis of Advaita Vedanta is summarized in this quote from the , one of his (philosophical treatises): > In half a couplet I state, what has been stated by crores of texts; > that is Brahman alone is real, the world is mithyā (not independently > existent), > and the individual self is nondifferent from Brahman.Shankara, > Vivekacūḍāmaṇi =Neo-Vedanta= In the 19th century, Vivekananda played a major role in the revival of Hinduism, and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the Ramakrishna Mission. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called \\"Neo-Vedanta\\". In a talk on \\"The absolute and manifestation\\" given in at London in 1896 Swami Vivekananda said, Vivekananda emphasized samadhi as a means to attain liberation. Yet this emphasis is not to be found in the Upanishads nor in Shankara. For Shankara, meditation and Nirvikalpa Samadhi are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman, not the highest goal itself: Vivekenanda's modernisation has been criticized: =Neo-Advaita= Neo-Advaita is a new religious movement based on a modern, Western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta, especially the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. Neo-Advaita is being criticized for discarding the traditional prerequisites of knowledge of the scriptures and \\"renunciation as necessary preparation for the path of jnana-yoga\\". Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja, his students Gangaji Andrew Cohen,, Madhukar and Eckhart Tolle. Yoga The prime means to reach moksha is through the practice of yoga (Sanskrit, Pāli: , /ˈjəʊɡə/, ') which is a commonly known generic term for physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines which originated in ancient India. Specifically, yoga is one of the six āstika (\\"orthodox\\") schools of Hindu philosophy. Various traditions of yoga are found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Pre–philosophical speculations and diverse ascetic practices of first millennium BCE were systematized into a formal philosophy in early centuries CE by the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. By the turn of the first millennium, Hatha yoga emerged as a prominent tradition of yoga distinct from the Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. While the Yoga Sutras focus on discipline of the mind, Hatha yoga concentrates on health and purity of the body. Hindu monks, beginning with Swami Vivekananda, brought yoga to the West in the late 19th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a physical system of health exercises across the Western world. Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma and heart patients. In a national survey, long- term yoga practitioners in the United States reported musculo–skeletal and mental health improvements. =Jnana yoga= Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of jnana yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of four stages: * Samanyasa or Sampattis,Adi Shankara, Tattva bodha (1.2) the \\"fourfold discipline\\" (sādhana-catustaya), cultivating the following four qualities: ** ' (नित्यानित्य वस्तु विवेकम्) – The ability to correctly discriminate (viveka) between the eternal (nitya) substance (Brahman) and the substance that is transitory existence (anitya). ** ' (इहाऽमुत्रार्थ फल भोगविरागम्) – The renunciation (virāga) of enjoyments of objects (artha phala bhoga) in this world (iha) and the other worlds (amutra) like heaven etc. ** ' (शमादि षट्क सम्पत्ति) – the sixfold qualities, *** Śama (control of the ). *** Dama (the control of external sense organs). *** Uparati (the cessation of these external organs so restrained, from the pursuit of objects other than that, or it may mean the abandonment of the prescribed works according to scriptural injunctions). *** ' (the tolerating of ). *** ' (the faith in Guru and Vedas). ***' (the concentrating of the mind on God and Guru). ** ' (मुमुक्षुत्वम्) – The firm conviction that the nature of the world is misery and the intense longing for moksha (release from the cycle of births and deaths). * Sravana, listening to the teachings of the sages on the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta, and studying the Vedantic texts, such as the Brahma Sutras. In this stage the student learns about the reality of Brahman and the identity of atman; * Manana, the stage of reflection on the teachings; * Dhyana, the stage of meditation on the truth \\"that art Thou\\". =Bhakti yoga= The paths of bhakti yoga and karma yoga are subsidiary. In bhakti yoga, practice centers on the worship God in any way and in any form, like Krishna or Ayyappa. Adi Shankara himself was a proponent of devotional worship or Bhakti. But Adi Shankara taught that while Vedic sacrifices, puja and devotional worship can lead one in the direction of jnana (true knowledge), they cannot lead one directly to moksha. At best, they can serve as means to obtain moksha via shukla gati. =Karma yoga= Karma yoga is the way of doing our duties, in disregard of personal gains or losses. According to Sri Swami Sivananda, Jainism Jainism (; ', Samaṇam, ', ', Jainmat, '), is an Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence towards all living beings. Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the soul toward divine consciousness and liberation. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a jina (\\"conqueror\\" or \\"victor\\"). The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called siddha. Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as shramana dharma (self-reliant) or the \\"path of the nirganthas\\" (those without attachments or aversions). In Jainism highest form of pure knowledge a soul can attain is called Kevala Jnana (Sanskrit: केवलज्ञान) or Kevala Ṇāṇa (Prakrit: केवल णाण). which means \\"absolute or perfect\\" and Jñāna, which means \\"knowledge\\". Kevala is the state of isolation of the jīva from the ajīva attained through ascetic practices which burn off one's karmic residues, releasing one from bondage to the cycle of death and rebirth. Kevala Jñāna thus means infinite knowledge of self and non-self, attained by a soul after annihilation of the all ghātiyā karmas. The soul which has reached this stage achieves moksa or liberation at the end of its life span. Mahavira, 24th thirthankara of Jainism, is said to have practised rigorous austerities for 12 years before he attained enlightenment, Kevala Jñāna is one of the five major events in the life of a Tirthankara and is known as Keval Jñāna Kalyanaka and celebrated of all gods. Lord Mahavira's Kaivalya was said to have been celebrated by the demi-gods, who constructed the Samosarana or a grand preaching assembly for him. Western understanding In the Western world the concept of enlightenment in a religious context acquired a romantic meaning. It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self, which is being regarded as a substantial essence which is covered over by social conditioning. As 'Aufklärung' The use of the Western word enlightenment is based on the supposed resemblance of bodhi with Aufklärung, the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with Romanticism than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances. Awakening: Historical period of renewed interest in religion The equivalent term \\"awakening\\" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these \\"Great Awakenings\\" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations. Illumination Another equivalent term is Illuminationism, which was also used by Paul Demieville in his work The Mirror of the Mind, in which he made a distinction between \\"illumination subie\\" and \\"illumination graduelle\\".Bernard Faure, Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field Illuminationism is a doctrine according to which the process of human thought needs to be aided by divine grace. It is the oldest and most influential alternative to naturalism in the theory of mind and epistemology.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy It was an important feature of ancient Greek philosophy, Neoplatonism, medieval philosophy, and in particular, the Illuminationist school of Islamic philosophy. Augustine was an important proponent of Illuminationism, stating that everything we know is taught to us by God as He casts His light over the world,Illumination and Enlightenment saying that \\"The mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside itself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself the nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord,\\" Confessions IV.xv.25 and \\"You hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me.\\"Confessions X.ii.2 Augustine's version of illuminationism is not that God gives us certain information, but rather gives us insight into the truth of the information we received for ourselves. Romanticism and transcendentalism This romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki.Robert H. Sharf, Whose Zen? Zen Nationalism RevisitedHu Shih: Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism in China. Its History and Method Further popularization was due to the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin.Critical introduction by John McRae to the reprint of Dumoulin's A history of Zen Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber. In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:David Chapman: Effing the ineffable Experience A common reference in Western culture is the notion of \\"enlightenment experience\\". This notion can be traced back to William James, who used the term \\"religious experience\\" in his book, The Varieties of Religious Experience. Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \\"religious experience\\" further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \\"religious experience\\" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was popularised by the Transcendentalists, and exported to Asia via missionaries. Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th-century rationalism, John Locke's philosophy of Sensualism, and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, various religions, and German idealism. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential. The notion of \\"experience\\" has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that \\"experience\\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of \\"experience\\" introduces a false notion of duality between \\"experiencer\\" and \\"experienced\\", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \\"non-duality\\" of observer and observed. \\"Pure experience\\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \\"experience\\" someone has, which means that this \\"experience\\" is not the proof of the teaching, but a result of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \\"cleansing the doors of perception\\", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence. Nevertheless, the notion of religious experience has gained widespread use in the study of religion, and is extensively researched. Western culture Christianity The word \\"enlightenment\\" is not generally used in Christian contexts for religious understanding or insight. More commonly used terms in the Christian tradition are religious conversion and revelation. Lewis Sperry Chafer (1871–1952), one of the founders of Dispensationalism, uses the word \\"illuminism\\". Christians who are \\"illuminated\\" are of two groups, those who have experienced true illuminism (biblical) and those who experienced false illuminism (not from the Holy Spirit). Christian interest in eastern spirituality has grown throughout the 20th century. Notable Christians, such as Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle and AMA Samy, have participated in Buddhist training and even become Buddhist teachers themselves. In a few places Eastern contemplative techniques have been integrated in Christian practices, such as centering prayer.Contemplative Outreach: Centering Prayer But this integration has also raised questions about the borders between these traditions.Inner Explorations: Christian Enlightenment? Western esotericism and mysticism Western and Mediterranean culture has a rich tradition of esotericism and mysticism. The Perennial philosophy, basic to the New Age understanding of the world, regards those traditions as akin to Eastern religions which aim at awakening/ enlightenment and developing wisdom. The hypothesis that all mystical traditions share a \\"common core\\", is central to New Age, but contested by a diversity of scientists like Katz and Proudfoot. Judaism includes the mystical tradition of Kabbalah. Islam includes the mystical tradition of Sufism. In the Fourth Way teaching, enlightenment is the highest state of Man (humanity). Nondualism A popular western understanding sees \\"enlightenment\\" as \\"nondual consciousness\\", \\"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\\". It is used interchangeably with Neo-Advaita. This nondual consciousness is seen as a common stratum to different religions. Several definitions or meanings are combined in this approach, which makes it possible to recognize various traditions as having the same essence. According to Renard, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of \\"the Real\\" This idea of nonduality as \\"the central essence\\" is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements. Western predecessors are, among others, New Age, Wilber's synthesis of western psychology and Asian spirituality, the idea of a Perennial Philosophy, and Theosophy. Eastern influences are the Hindu reform movements such as Aurobindo's Integral Yoga and Vivekananda's Neo-Vedanta, the Vipassana movement, and Buddhist modernism. A truly syncretistic influence is Osho and the Rajneesh movement, a hybrid of eastern and western ideas and teachings, and a mainly western group of followers. Cognitive aspects Religious experience as cognitive construct \\"Religious experiences\\" have \\"evidential value\\", since they confirm the specific worldview of the experiencer: Yet, just like the very notion of \\"religious experience\\" is shaped by a specific discourse and habitus, the \\"uniformity of interpretation\\" may be due to the influence of religious traditions which shape the interpretation of such experiences. Various religious experiences Yandell discerns various \\"religious experiences\\" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the \\"evidential value\\" they present. Yandell discerns five sorts: # Numinous experiences – Monotheism (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic, Sufi Islam) # Nirvanic experiences – Buddhism, \\"according to which one sees that the self is but a bundle of fleeting states\\" # Kevala experiences – Jainism, \\"according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience\\" # Moksha experiences – Hinduism, Brahman \\"either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless\\" # Nature mystical experience Cognitive science Various philosophers and cognitive scientists state that there is no \\"true self\\" or a \\"little person\\" (homunculus) in the brain that \\"watches the show,\\" and that consciousness is an emergent property that arise from the various modules of the brain in ways that are yet far from understood. According to Susan Greenfield, the \\"self\\" may be seen as a composite, whereas Douglas R. Hofstadter describes the sense of \\"I\\" as a result of cognitive process. This is in line with the Buddhist teachings, which state that To this end, Parfit called Buddha the \\"first bundle theorist\\". The idea that the mind is the result of the activities of neurons in the brain was most notably popularized by Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, in his book The Astonishing Hypothesis. The basic idea can be traced back to at least Étienne Bonnot de Condillac. According to Crick, the idea was not a novel one: Entheogens Several users of entheogens throughout the ages have claimed experiences of spiritual enlightenment with the use of these substances, their use and prevalence through history is well recorded, and continues today. In modern times we have seen increased interest in these practices, for example the rise of interest in Ayahuasca. The psychological effects of these substances have been subject to scientific research focused on understanding their physiological basis. While entheogens do produce glimpses of higher spiritual states, these are always temporary, fading with the effects of the substance. Permanent enlightenment requires making permanent changes in your consciousness.

He was born in San Francisco in 1924 to Lou Cameron Sr. and Ruth Marvin Cameron, a vaudeville comedian and his vocalist wife. Cameron served in Europe during World War II in the U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division (\\"Hell On Wheels\\"). Before becoming a writer, Cameron illustrated comics such as Classics Illustrated and miscellaneous horror comics. One of his first written stories, \\"The Last G.I.,\\" is a science fiction story about American soldiers struggling to survive in a nuclear battlefield. It appeared in Real War (volume 2 number 2, October 1958). His work usually boasted muscular, no-nonsense prose through a prism of wry cynicism, sharp observation, and a signature combination of gusto with pulp- style gritty realism; he was also expert at devising unexpected, 11th hour plot twists. Fantastically versatile and prolific, his work ran the gamut in quality from inspired artistry, to for-the-buck shock sensationalism. But his style remained individual and unmistakable. The film-to-book adaptations he wrote include None but the Brave (based on the anti-war film directed by and starring Frank Sinatra), California Split (based on the Joseph Walsh screenplay for the Robert Altman film starring Elliott Gould and George Segal), Sky Riders (based on the adventure film starring James Coburn, Robert Culp and Susannah York), Hannibal Brooks (based on the screenplay written by the team of Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais for the Michael Winner film starring Oliver Reed and Michael J. Pollard), and an epic volume based on a number of scripts for the award-winning CBS miniseries How the West Was Won that starred James Arness (not to be confused with the novelization by Louis L'Amour of the identically titled feature film, although the TV series was loosely based on that film). On top of these labeled novelizations, Cameron wrote what's known as an inferred novelization, which doesn't declare itself directly as such, but can be divined from indicia. The WWII adventure novel, Morituri by German author W. J. Lueddecke, a bestseller in Europe, had not been published in English before work began on the film. The translation, by H.R. Noerdlinger, had been commissioned by 20th Century Fox for in-studio use only. It was probably deemed unfit for commercial publication on its own terms. Thus, the movie tie-in paperback novel that hit the book racks in 1965, copyright to the publisher, Fawcett, contains, on its title page, the by-lines of author and translator, and under that, \\"Edited for Gold Medal Books by Lou Cameron.\\" This page is opposite a page of movie credits, including \\"Screenplay by Daniel Taradash.\\" Cameron's credit is thus \\"code\\" for his actual assignment — which was to create a new, hybrid novel drawn from both the translation of the original and the Taradash screenplay, both of which materials would have been provided by the movie studio. He also wrote two novels based on TV series: an original, The Outsider, based on the Private Eye series created by Roy Huggins and starring Darren McGavin; and \\"A Praying Mantis Kills\\", one of the novelizations of the Kung Fu television series, under the \\"house name\\" (shared pseudonym provided by the publisher) \\"Howard Lee\\". (The three other books in that series were written, also as Howard Lee, by Barry N. Maltzberg and Ron Goulart.) Alone among Cameron's tie-ins, \\"The Outsider\\" is written in the first person, from the POV of its main character, P.I. David Ross. Though that perspective is naturally derived from the main character's voice-over commentary in the episodes, Cameron often employed first person narrative in his original novels, particularly the earlier (1960-1970) standalone works, such as \\"The Empty Quarter\\", \\"Angel's Flight\\", \\"The Good Guy\\" and \\"The Amphorae Pirates\\". Cameron also created the character Longarm — whose adventures, starting in the late 1970s, pretty much defined the then-new sex- and-sagebrush subgenre of the \\"adult\\" Western — under the house name \\"Tabor Evans\\" and wrote at least 52 of the more-than-400 books in the series. He wrote the Renegade series as \\"Ramsay Thorne\\", and the Stringer series under his own name. He also wrote at least one Easy Company novel as \\"John Wesley Howard\\", In 2004, his novel The Subway Stalker was adapted to film by French director Jean-Pierre Mocky as Le Furet. He received awards for his Western writings, such as the Golden Spur for The Spirit Horses. He wrote in estimate over 300 books, including titles below compiled from copyright records at the Library of Congress.

It borders the prefecture-level city of Suqian to the southwest and the Yellow Sea to the east. General Information Guanyun is a county under the jurisdiction of Lianyungang that is one of thirteen prefecture cities of Jiangsu Province. The name Guanyun is made of two Chinese characters, Guan and Yun, which are taken from Guan River and Yuntai Mountain, in which both of them are important landmarks for the county. In history, Guanyun was a salt-making site for the ancient Chinese Qing Dynasty. Guan River, with its excellent condition comparing with Rhine River and water quality, recently stunned locals, seeing tens of whales from the Yellow Sea swum back into the river waterway. Geography, Resources and Climate Guanyun is a coastal city of the East China Sea (the Yellow Sea) with a coastline of . It borders Guannan (a county under the jurisdiction of Lianyungang), Xiangshui (under the jurisdiction Yancheng), Lianshui (under the jurisdiction of Huai�an), and Shuyang (under the jurisdiction of Suqian). Guanhe River is an inner river of Jiangsu, running eastwards into the China East Sea in Guanyun. The river is in length and its main tributary is Sihe River, flowing through the southern portion of the county.

Shuyang is a pilot administrative division for \\"provinces governing county level units directly\\" in Jiangsu, along with Kunshan and Taixing. Etymology The name of “Shuyang” was first officially used in 549 AD during Eastern Wei. The two Chinese characters in the county's name are “沭” and “阳”, together meaning “in the north of the Shuhe River”. As the government and commercial center, the county seat was chosen to be constructed in the north of Shuhe River in 549 AD in order to control the land around the river basin.（清）唐仲冕修、汪梅鼎等撰，《嘉庆海州直隶州志》，江苏古籍出版社，2008年. History The City Wall in 1803 Prior to its proclamation as Zhou Dynasty in 1111 BC, the area around northern of Jiangsu was inhabited by the Dongyi, an ancient ethnic established numerous city-states. The area around Shuyang belonged to one of Dongyi states called ‘Tan (郯)’.（民国）戴仁、张景衡、吴鹏等监修，《民国重修沭阳县志》，江苏古籍出版社，2008年. In the late period of Zhou Dynasty, that is Spring and Autumn period, the State of Lu began to expand its power to the south. Part of the region was officially proclaimed as the territory of the State of Lu in 582 BC after the fortress, ‘Zhongcheng (中城)’, was built on the northwest. This is also the first city in this place in accordance with ‘The Spring and Autumn Annals’ which compiled by Confucius. In the Warring States period, the Chu conquered and controlled the land of this area. After Qin's wars of unification, the Qin Dynasty was established by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. ‘Houqiu County ()’ was founded for administrating the region and the governments of later dynasties generally follow this pattern. In 549 AD, the imperial government of Eastern Wei abandoned the old castle and city wall and moved the local government into a new county seat near the north of Shuhe River. In the meantime, the county was changed to the present name, Shuyang County (). In later 1400 years, the location of the county seat keep constant. On the Shuhe Riverside As the main natural disaster in the northern Jiangsu, rain storms and floods are the principle threat to the county in old days. The castle and city wall of Shuyang was totally destroyed up to the middle of the 15th century. The government rebuilt the city wall until 1512 and was ruined by the floods subsequently. In 1594, the local government started to rebuild a substantial one with a plenty of bricks and stones and finished in 1616. In early modern period, the life in this region are recognised as peaceful and stable for most of the time. However, the life in modern years was full of challenges and crises. The biggest crisis was the Japanese invasion in 1937. The city wall and many ancient architecture were devastated at the beginning of the war. Geography Shuyang is on the North China Plain, approximately 260 kilometers to Nanjing, and 450 kilometers to the center of Shanghai.

Demography Shuyang is the most populated county in Jiangsu with a population of 1.93 million. It is also considered to be one of the most populated counties in China. Shuyang had a metropolitan population of more than 560,000 refer to 2010 census, making it a midsize city. Major areas of population growth in recent years were in suburbs like Nanhu and Mengxi where now a part of the metropolitan area.

Some 30% of the population of the whole region are residents of the metropolitan area, making Shuyang a thriving city in the north of Jiangsu. Economy In the period of Republic of China, the economy in Shuyang had collapsed due to the Japanese invasion and frequent floods. In the 1950s, the economy developed rapidly benefit from the recovery and further development of agriculture and industry in the region. However, Shuyang formed decreasingly important in the economy of the Jiangsu Province from the time of Cultural Revolution. Compared with the cities in the southern part of Jiangsu, the local governments held a conservative and pedantic opinion on the economy. In 1997, the Qiu He Government began its ambitious reformations. The economic portion of the reform mainly focused on the industrialization and privatization and it works.

The dialect of Haisi has largely lost initial n, replacing it with l, and the retention of entering tone set it apart from other mandarin dialects. The speaker of the dialect could easily understand other mandarins, not vice versa. As the Standard Chinese (Putonghua) forms increasingly powerful in social life, it has largely impacted on the dialect in words, pronunciation, and grammar. Religions Freedom of religion makes people of all religions live in harmony. However, approximately 95% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in accordance with 2010 Census although Shuyang attaches a wide variety of holy turf.

It was written by Suzanne Francis and Gabe Grifoni. Plot Fran Kranz stars as Joel, a guy who has recently been dumped by his girlfriend (on the advice of an abusive television therapist Dr. Dwayne, played by Darrell Hammond), sending him into a spiral of depression. His two friends, Wyatt (Kenan Thompson) and Ben (Zachary Levi), a closeted gay man, take him on a road trip to lift his spirits and take revenge on Dr. Dwayne. The friends take their trip in Wyatt's van, which he has customized into a cross-country hotdog stand called the weinerwagon in an attempt to impress Oscar Mayer and get a job with them. On the way, they encounter an elderly nymphomaniac couple Frank and Felicia Applebaum (Blake Clark and Mindy Sterling) who had sexual intercourse in front of them. After being dropped off, Mr Applebaum says \\"Next time bring Da noise or Da Funk\\" and does a break dance in front of them. They realized their wallets are stolen by three women, leaving them with only ten dollars delivered to Wyatt in a 15-year-old birthday card from his grandmother. They use this money to enter into a hot bod contest, on which Ben had a flashback of his mother constantly yelling at him to work hard in the competition. After getting advice from a man named Walrus Boy, he wins, getting $1000 for the prize. As they approach their destination, Joel abandons his friends in a fit of hopelessness, winding up drunk in a back alley. His childhood tormenter, Drake Hanswald (Andy Milonakis), appears in a hallucination, and Joel watches helplessly as his younger self is tormented by Drake and all of his other classmates. Realizing that he needs to change his situation and stand up for himself, Joel returns to his friends just in time to save them from the hippies who had previously stolen Wyatt's hood ornament. The next morning, they go to the studio where Dr. Dwayne's show is filmed and sneak in. After beating up Dr. Dwayne's decoy, the real Dr. Dwayne appears, revealing that he intentionally caused Joel's breakup to motivate Joel to take a stand for himself. He also reveals that he has found a rich man that Wyatt had saved from a life of drugs, who is willing to finance Wyatt's Wieners. Ben makes a speech to the audience and accepts his homosexuality. Now that the friends have all achieved what they needed, they head home, and we learn that Wyatt's Wieners became the 4th most successful pre-packaged meat company in the U.S. and that he lives in a hotdog-shaped house with his dachshund named Beyoncé. Ben went on to become a successful lawyer and cologne designer, and that he currently lives with his \\"roommate\\" Johnathan and his two cats. Joel invented \\"unpantsable\\" pants, and the three friends take the Wienerwagon on a road trip every year to spread cross-country happiness.

A large medieval cemetery surrounds the church with numerous khachkars. A modern cemetery adjacent has started to encroach upon the old one, leaving many of the khachkars and ancient tombstones upturned in a pile, moved from their original locations. Upon a hill adjacent to the modern cemetery is yet another ancient cemetery with many khachkars. Within the village is a small ruined basilica called \\"Jam\\" by the locals with ancient khachkars and tombstones built into its walls, and not far away is a small shrine. There are also two large stone forts from the Middle Ages located 2 km to the east and 3 km the west of the village. Other khachkars may be seen along the main road leading to the hill where Kotavank rests upon. In early medieval years it was the capital of the region known during that time as Kot. Both Kotavank and Kot were partially destroyed during invasions in the 10th and 11th centuries and later by an earthquake.  Architecture  The church of S. Astvatsatsin was built in the 9th century by Prince Grigor Supan, the son of Princess Mariam, who reigned from the late 9th to the early 10th century. It has a large cruciform rectangular-plan constructed from roughly hewn basalt blocks. There are two portals that lead into the space from the south and west walls. The roof, drum, and dome have since collapsed, while the walls, some of the vaulting (one vault has collapsed), and the semicircular apse with four side rooms are still intact. The apse of the church is located at the eastern end of the church. The north and south wings are semicircular in plan, whereas the west wing is rectangular. Two of the prayer rooms or \\"studies\\" are entered through the north and south walls of the western rectangular wing. The other two are entered from the east walls of the northern and southern semicircular wings. Above the studies were secret chambers that were meant to be used as places to hide from invading armies. These areas are partially viewable through two holes high upon the wall on either side of the apse. The dome and drum that once stood above, had numerous decorations. Under the church were two tunnels; one that lead from the church to a nearby spring, and another used as an escape route in case of invasion that lead from the church to the valley.

A legend is that Emperor Sun Quan (182–252) settled in the Nanjing area and he had the lake created and filled with water. The lake was named for a black dragon, believed to be a water god by Chinese Taoists, from a Southern dynasty (420-859) legend.

In a 2017 Classic Voice poll of the greatest works of art music since 2000, the number of total votes received by Saunders compositions was the third highest (30), surpassed only by the works of Georg Friedrich Haas (49) and Simon Steen-Andersen (35). Biography Saunders studied violin and composition at the University of Edinburgh, earning a PhD in Composition in 1997. As a DAAD scholar, she studied with Wolfgang Rihm from 1991 to 1994 at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe; Nigel Osborne supervised her doctoral thesis. Her awards include the Busoni Prize of the Berlin Academy of the Arts, Sponsorship award (1994), the Ernst von Siemens Composers' Prize (1996), the Hindemith Prize of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival (2003), the composition prize of the ARD, and the Mauricio Kagel Music Prize (2015). In 2019 she won the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (main prize), the second woman, and first female composer to be awarded. In 2010 and 2012, she taught at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses and was composer-in-residence at the Konzerthaus Dortmund from 2005–2006, Staatskapelle Dresden from 2009–2010, and Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival in 2010. Fabio Luisi and the Staatskapelle Dresden gave the UK premiere of Saunders' revision of traces at the 2009 Proms. Her music has been performed by notable ensembles worldwide, including Ensemble Musikfabrik, Klangforum Wien, Ensemble Modern, Quatuor Diotima, Ensemble Dal Niente, the Arditti Quartet, Ensemble Resonanz, Ensemble Recherche, ICE, the Neue Vocalsolisten, Ensemble Remix, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.  Music  Saunders's music is characterized by limited pitch material and a wide breadth of timbral complexity. She is fascinated with resonance and extraneous noise created by instrumentalists, such as the scratch of a bow change, the thud of the pedals of a piano or harp, and the taps and slides of the left hand on a string instrument's fingerboard. Due to the subtleties and specificity of the sounds she creates, Saunders includes lengthy textual explanations in many of her scores to describe each effect that she wishes the performer to produce. Much of Saunders's music is based upon a single pitch, or sometimes a small collection of pitches which govern large sections of music. Therefore, development and elaboration are determined more by sonority and texture rather than traditional voice leading. However, she does sometimes include “quasi-diatonic” pitch collections, which suggest a more traditional context than that of her music based on single notes. Rebecca Saunders has also explored physical space in her music.

Organization It was founded in 1962 as the Association of Norwegian Theatres (), an association for theatre institutions. Its name was changed after symphony orchestras were included in the organisation from 1989. The organisation has 42 member bodies. The member bodies are generally members of Arbeidsgiverforeningen Spekter as well. This way the member bodies follow the trade and tariff agreements of Spekter, but negotiate with their relevant trade unions through the Association of Norwegian Theatres and Orchestras. The Association of Norwegian Theatres and Orchestras is itself a member body of the Performing Arts Employers Associations League Europe. Hans Heiberg was chairman from 1962 to 1964. Arnljot Strømme Svendsen chaired the association for 22 years, from 1970 to 1992. The current director general is Morten Gjelten, and chairman of the board is Bernt Bauge. The association awards the Hedda Award. Their headquarters are located in Storgata near Oslo Cathedral. The association is co-publisher of the online magazine Scenekunst.no, together with the association for independent theatre groups, the Norwegian Association for Performing Arts. NTO earlier issued the paper magazine Scenen. Statistics and documentary work From 1987 to 1994 published an annual yearbook, containing a detailed record of productions and performances on Norwegian stages. The yearbook listed production details such as names of stage directors, set designers, actors and technical staff, date of first night, and number of performances. In 1986 the association represented thirteen subsidized theatres (including Den Norske Opera), which showed a total number of 4,800 performances for 1,130,000 spectators. In 1993 the association represented twenty subsidized theatres and six symphonic orchestras. The theatres had a total number of 353 productions, and the 7,600 performances were viewed by 1,490,000 spectators. In addition to the institutional theatres, the yearbook covered theatre productions for Radio and Television, and by independent professional groups (134 productions listed for 1993).

A field goal is normally 17 yards (7 yards in Canadian football) longer than the distance of the line of scrimmage to the goal line, as it includes the end zone (10 yards) and 7 yards to where the holder places the ball. In Canadian football, the goal posts are on the goal lines, in front of the end zones. Therefore, if the line of scrimmage is at the 30, the field goal would be 47 yards (in American football) or 37 yards (in Canadian football). Average field goal range The exact field goal range varies for each team, depending on the ability of the team's placekicker. While some weaker placekickers may have trouble kicking field goals longer than 30 yards (making field goals from beyond the 13 difficult), others may consistently make 50-yarders, making it practical to kick from beyond the 33. For most NFL kickers, the 35-yard line is typically the limit of their field goal range. Weather conditions, particularly wind, also have a significant impact on field goal range; kicking with the wind at the kicker's back significantly increases field goal range, while kicking against the wind or with a stiff crosswind will greatly reduce the kicker's effective range, while generally there is no advantage beyond assured targeting of a kick if a game is being played indoors. Heavy snowfall can greatly reduce field goal range, both by weighing the ball down and by making it more difficult to get a secure spotting of the ball or sufficient momentum in the run-up. Altitude also affects kicking range; both the longest punt in NFL history and three of the longest field goals in NFL history took place in Denver, Colorado, which is more than higher in elevation than the next-highest NFL city (the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, Arizona). From the 1970s through the 1990s, artificial turf improved a kicker's field goal range by having less friction during the kick; one of the reasons Scott Norwood missed the game- winning kick in Super Bowl XXV was that he kicked on artificial turf in Buffalo and struggled with longer field goals on natural grass throughout his career, and Super Bowl XXV was played on a grass surface. (Modern artificial turf, which has similar depth and characteristics to natural grass, does not have an appreciable effect on kicking range.) In high school football, players are permitted to kick off special flat kicking tees up to two inches high. The NCAA banned the use of kicking tees in 1989. Most of the longer-range field goals in NCAA history were kicked prior to the elimination of tees; the use of tees allowed the ball to be elevated out of the field's grass or turf, reducing friction in the opening milliseconds of the kick and allowing for longer kicks. Kicking versus punting If a kicker is outside of field goal range, teams will generally punt. However, punting too close to the end zone increases the risk of a touchback, which nullifies most of the effect of the punt. Thus, teams who face a fourth down between the 35 and 40 yard lines (closer in a crosswind) often will go for the more risky fourth down conversion rather than risk either the touchback or the missed field goal. Record holders The longest field goal in recorded football history was 69 yards, set by collegiate kicker Ove Johansson, who was born in Sweden, in a 1976 Abilene Christian University football game against East Texas State University (now Texas A&M; Commerce) at Shotwell Stadium in Abilene. The longest successful field goal in the NFL was 64 yards and was completed by Matt Prater in 2013. The NCAA record is 67 yards held by 3 kickers, Russell Erxleben of Texas, Steve Little of Arkansas and Joe Williams of Wichita State University. All three of those kickers achieved that feat in the 1977-1978 college seasons. Notably, Johansson, Erxleben and Little all failed dramatically when they entered the NFL-- Johansson's failure was due to an injury, but the other two were first-round draft busts. The CFL record is 62 yards held by Paul McCallum, the NFL preseason record 65 yards held by Ola Kimrin, the independent amateur record (as well as the record without the aid of a tee; tees are not allowed in the NFL and have been banned from NCAA since 1989) is 68 yards held by Fabrizio Scaccia, and the high school record 68 yards held by Dirk Borgognone; high school has wider goal posts and treats a field goal attempt that lands short in the field of play the same as a punt, making longer attempts much less risky. The indoor football record, with narrower and higher goal posts, is 63 yards (set by Aaron Mills), which is practically as long of a field goal as is possible in that variant of the sport, since the field in indoor football (including both end zones) is only 66 yards. Scaccia, while playing indoor football, attempted a 64-yard kick that was inches short of success, hitting the crossbar. Longer field goals have been attempted at times; the longest attempt in the NFL, which was well short and was kicked into the wind, was 76 yards, attempted by Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland Raiders, in a September 28, 2008 game against the San Diego Chargers. NFL Europe rewarded kickers that successfully kicked a field goal of longer than 50 yards with a bonus point, making such field goals worth 4 points instead of 3; this rule has since been adopted by the Stars Football League. The shortest possible field goal under current strategies is slightly over 17 yards in American football and 8 yards in Canadian football (Canadian football requires the ball to be snapped at least one yard away from the end zone). Theoretically, a field goal could be attempted from a shorter distance as long as the holder stays behind the line of scrimmage (or via a drop kick at any point on the field), but in practice this has never happened. Drop kicks It has been surmised that a drop kick has a slightly longer range than the standard place kick, but since these kicks are so rare, that is not known for sure. During the early NFL era, this was generally true, and drop kicks were the norm for longer field goals; in fact, the first unofficial NFL record kick of 55 yards, set by Paddy Driscoll in 1924, was indeed set by drop kick. The football was shaped differently in that era, being changed to its modern, more narrow shape in 1935, so it is not reasonable to compare field goals from that era with the modern era, any more than it is reasonable to compare a kick with a rugby ball with an American football today. Further complicating any comparisons is that statistics reporting during the era of the round-ended ball was inconsistent and lacked any central authority or standardization; newspapers reported Driscoll's field goal as variously being 50, 52 or 55 yards, and are also inconsistent as to whether the kick was by drop kick or place kick. Driscoll also kicked a reported 50-yard drop kick in 1925 (newspaper reports were again inconsistent) and is the only known example of a kicker to have done so from that distance. The only successful drop kick in the NFL since the 1941 NFL Championship Game was by Doug Flutie, the backup quarterback of the New England Patriots, against the Miami Dolphins on January 1, 2006, for an extra point after a touchdown. Flutie had estimated \\"an 80 percent chance\\" of making the drop kick, which was called to give Flutie, 43 at the time, the opportunity to make a historic kick in his final NFL game, the drop kick being his last play in the NFL. After the game, New England coach Bill Belichick said, \\"I think Doug deserves it,\\" and Flutie said, \\"I just thanked him for the opportunity.\\" The kick was executed from 27 yards out (Flutie stood in a punter position, 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage). Drew Brees, a former teammate of Flutie's, attempted a drop-kicked extra point from the same position during the poorly received 2012 Pro Bowl; his kick, however, fell short.

He was an aviation adviser to Chiang Kai-shek's government in China during the 1930s, and an intelligence officer in World War II. Born in Sydney, Malley first saw service in World War I as an artilleryman with the Australian Imperial Force. He transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in 1917, and the following year flew Sopwith Camels with No. 4 Squadron on the Western Front. Malley was awarded the Military Cross for his achievements in combat, and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the Air Force Cross. After a spell in civilian life following the war, Malley joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No. 3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and worked closely with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino- Japanese War at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961. Early life Garnet Francis Malley, the second youngest of six children of Clara Ellen Merritt and Francis Malley, was born in Mosman, a suburb of Sydney, on 2 November 1892. His father, an ironworker originally from Gosford, founded the whitegoods firm Malley's. He later served two terms as alderman of Mosman Council. Garnet Malley attended the Church of England Preparatory School in Mosman, The School in Mount Victoria, and Hawkesbury Agricultural College in Richmond. At the outbreak of World War I he was an apprentice mechanic at Malley's.Coulthard- Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 5 World War I Malley joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 12 October 1915. He departed Melbourne for Egypt as a gunner with reinforcements of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade aboard HMAT Wandilla on 9 November. In March 1916, he was posted to the Western Front in France, and joined his unit in May. The 1st Brigade took part in the Battles of Pozières and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916.Bean, The Australian Imperial Force in France, pp. 581–582 Bean, The Australian Imperial Force in France, p. 754 Malley transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as a mechanic in April 1917, before undertaking flying instruction at the Oxford University air school. He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 9 October and assigned to No. 4 Squadron AFC, then based in Birmingham.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 6 Equipped with Sopwith Camel fighters, No. 4 Squadron deployed to Bruay, France, in December 1917, and commenced operations on 9 January 1918.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 228 That same day Malley, nicknamed \\"Garnie\\" (or \\"George\\", by No. 4 Squadron's leading ace, Harry Cobby), was promoted lieutenant.Franks, Sopwith Camel Aces of World War 1, p. 75Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", pp. 6, 9 On 16 March, he achieved his first aerial victory, sending a fighter belonging to Manfred von Richthofen's Red Circus out of control above Annoeullin, near Douai.

Four days later, he and Lieutenant Roy King each claimed a German two-seater spotting for artillery between Ypres and Bailleul. On 30 May, Malley and Cobby led their flights on a bombing mission in the Lys region, after which they each destroyed a German observation balloon over Estaires.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 7Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres of War, pp. 278, 282, 285 Malley's final victory, over the Lys on 1 June, was a Pfalz D.III.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres of War, p. 286 His official tally was six German aircraft destroyed—four fighters, an observation balloon, and an unidentified observation plane—and he was wounded in action twice, by a bullet through the leg in March, and by shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire in May.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 8 He was awarded the Military Cross on 22 June. The citation was promulgated in The London Gazette: Malley took temporary command of No. 4 Squadron at the end of June 1918, overseeing its move from Clairmarais North to a new airfield at Reclinghem. In August, he was posted to No. 5 (Training) Squadron AFC at Minchinhampton, England. The squadron was part of the 1st Training Wing, led by Lieutenant Colonel Oswald Watt.Garrisson, Australian Fighter Aces, p. 12 Malley's rotation to home establishment was in accordance with Royal Air Force policy requiring pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 282 Known for flying a white Camel trainer, he received the Air Force Cross for his instructional work; the award was promulgated on 3 June 1919.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 9 Inter-war years No. 5 Squadron was disbanded in May 1919. Along with many other Australian Flying Corps personnel, including Colonel Watt, Major King, and Captain Les Holden, Malley returned to Australia aboard the troopship Kaisar-i-Hind, disembarking in Sydney on 19 June. He subsequently toured the country to promote the Peace Loan. On 24 August, while travelling from Melbourne to Sydney to commence his series of demonstration flights around New South Wales, Malley crashed his Avro 504K during takeoff from Benalla, Victoria.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", pp. 9–10 He was uninjured but had to return to Melbourne and eventually made his way north by train. Resuming his aerial program, he was reported on 17 September as having \\"thrilled\\" lunch-time crowds in Sydney the previous day with \\"three daring spiral dives\\" over Hyde Park. Malley was discharged from the AIF on 4 October 1919, and commissioned a captain in the Commonwealth Military Forces Reserve on 1 July 1920. He rejoined Malley's as a warehouse manager in 1921. In May that year, he served with Les Holden and other veteran pilots as a pall-bearer at Watt's funeral in Randwick. On 25 January 1922, Malley married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman. The union would produce one son, Maldon. Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter's volume on the Australian Flying Corps, first published in 1923 as part of the official history of Australia in the war.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps in the Western and Eastern Theatres of War, pp. iii–vii Flight Lieutenant Malley (second right) with Flight Lieutenant alt=Four men, each wearing a flying helmet and goggles Malley relinquished his appointment in the Commonwealth Military Forces on 18 June 1925. The following day, he was commissioned a flight lieutenant in the Citizen Air Force, the part-time active reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 10Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 243 He served as a pilot with No. 3 Squadron, which operated Airco DH.9s and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. Formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, the squadron transferred to the newly opened RAAF Richmond, New South Wales, on 30 June.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 123 From 1925 to 1928, Malley was vice president of the Australian Flying Corps Association. In January 1928, he was promoted to honorary squadron leader, and temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron in March–April. That year, he gave up his position with Malley's to become an aviation consultant to Australian National Airways (ANA), as well as a director of the company.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 11 In January–February 1929, he again temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron. That April, he was a member of the citizens' committee responsible for organising and funding the search for the Southern Cross and its crew, Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had force-landed in North West Australia during a flight from Richmond to England.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 295 Les Holden eventually located the missing airmen near the Kimberley region. In 1930, Malley transferred to the (inactive) RAAF Reserve. By 1931, ANA was in financial difficulties and Malley travelled to China to take up a position as an aviation adviser to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Kwangtung. Details of Malley's exact duties over the next five years—a time of civil war and Japanese infiltration—remain uncertain. He spent some time in Australia on holiday in 1936, after which he returned to his advisory role in China.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", pp. 11–12 On 1 February 1937, through the influence of the British Foreign Office, Malley's status was enhanced when he was made an honorary wing commander in the RAAF Reserve. He was by now serving as adviser to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, in her capacity as secretary- general of the aeronautical commission that directed China's air force; May- Ling extended to Malley her \\"warmest congratulations\\" for his \\"well deserved\\" promotion.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 13 One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the government. Malley found that the air ministry was being defrauded by foreign agents and Chinese officials colluding to charge inflated prices for military equipment.Tyson Li, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, pp. 134–135 Malley's stay increasingly involved him in the fighting in China; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940. In May 1938, he advised the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams: \\"there is a first-class war on here, which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes\\".Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 14 Williams and other members of the RAAF may have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 448–450Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", pp. 15–17 In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: \\"I ... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it – landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!\\" At any rate, Malley's reports of Japanese air tactics, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government. World War II and later life Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940, departing China with a note of thanks from May-Ling for his \\"loyal service\\" before rejoining the RAAF on active service as a squadron leader in October.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", pp. 17–18 He became the Air Force representative at the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre (COIC), Melbourne, a tri-service organisation responsible for intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, pp. 420–421 Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident in the wake of the attack on Darwin in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 18 COIC primarily handled naval intelligence, so Army and Air Force participation was part-time initially. By April 1941, Malley had been assigned a full-time role, and the RAAF was maintaining a round-the-clock presence. He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded Commander Rupert Long as Director of COIC. Malley was raised to acting group captain on 1 July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3 October. He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9 June 1943. General Douglas MacArthur praised Malley for his \\"foresight, planning, and organizational ability\\". The former aviator went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the Commonwealth Security Service in Canberra from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain. In 1948, Malley's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the Legion of Merit. By 1949, he had procured a yacht, the Royal Flight, which was used as a setting in the film The Blue Lagoon. The following year, the family bought a coconut plantation on Vanua Balavu, Fiji.Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", pp. 19–20 In September 1951, Malley and his wife toured the world, visiting Algiers, Guadeloupe, Curaçao, Martinique, and Tahiti. They subsequently returned to live on their Fijian plantation, and rode out the 1953 Suva earthquake and tsunami. Garnet Malley died of a heart attack on 20 May 1961. Survived by his wife and son, he was buried at sea in an Anglican ceremony. The commander-in-chief of the Taiwanese air force sent condolences, paying tribute to the \\"invaluable\\" contribution Malley had made during his decade in China, which would \\"be long remembered\\".Coulthard-Clark, \\"Garnet Malley and the RAAF's Chinese Connection\\", p. 19 Notes References       External links * Category:1892 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Australian Army officers Category:Australian aviators Category:Australian World War I flying aces Category:Foreign recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:People from Sydney Category:Recipients of the Air Force Cross (United Kingdom) Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Royal Australian Air Force officers Category:Royal Australian Air Force personnel of World War II ","title":"Garnet Malley"},{"id":"24705642","text":"In linguistics, the postelative case (abbreviated ) is a noun case that indicates location from behind.

Synopsis  In a village in Italy, a radio presenter, Carlo Mastelli, loses his hearing, and passes the microphone to Marina, the young teacher, who suggests launching an appeal whereby all listeners send postcards from their country to Tonino, a young student in danger. Artists and celebrities, mostly from Italy and France, take part in the appeal, and a number respond, which at the same time boosts the show's ratings, and brings great happiness to Carlo.  Commentary  Saluti e baci or Love and Kisses, is a film which deals with charity appeals a long time before the humanitarian appeals of Band Aid or Chanteurs Sans Frontières of the 1980s. In the film, a group of singers get together en masse to help those less fortunate than themselves, something which would later be seen in the Enfoirés who formed Les Restos du Cœur.

The primary habitat feature is Mathews Brake, the largest brake (natural wooded wetland area) in Leflore County. Each winter the brake provides habitat for over 30,000 ducks. Neotropical migratory birds use the refuge during migration seasons throughout the year. The refuge supports about 200 species of migratory birds, including priority species such as the prothonotary warbler. This little cavity nester is a species of concern in other areas, but has plenty of habitat around the wooded waters of Mathews Brake. Refuge staff manage the water level in the brake to promote moist-soil plants and to sustain oak trees around the edges for migratory birds. Other habitat types include of bottomland hardwoods and of young hardwood plantations. Hunting and fishing are the most popular programs on the refuge.

Built in 1450–1456, it is in a ruinous state but is a good example of a Mamluk mausoleum, with a domed funeral chamber, a Madrasa, a Sabil, a monumental door, and a minaret. The complex also includes a Khanqah, or monastery for the Sufi Darvishes. Inal had been a slave of Sultan Barquq and could neither read nor write. He ruled from 1453 to 1460 and does not appear to have any distinction other than his lack of education. Adjoining Inal's Mausoleum is that of Qurqumas, built in 1507. It is in a much better condition and more elegant that Inal's, which is heavier in style.  Polish- Egyptian restoriation works  In 1972, the Polish-Egyptian Group for the Restoration of Islamic Monuments was created. It was composed of specialists from several institutions, including the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw and the Institute of Mediterranean and Oriental Cultures, Polish Academy of Sciences. \\"The work on the site included archaeological excavations of grave chambers and foundations, anthropological research, architectural and conservation works, as well as historical studies, for example of the 16th-century donation deed of emir Qurqumas (hogga)\\". As a result of these works, which lasted until 2000, a protected antiquities zone was established around the complex which also includes the funerary complex of the sultan Inal. Qurqumas Qurqumas was the commander-in-chief of the armies, also called Grand Amir, at the time of his death in 1510, the following is Ibn Iyas describing his funeral, where the four qadis (judges) attended, and it was a funeral without equal. Qurqumas enjoyed the respect and the consideration of all. A former Mameluk of Ashraf Qaitbay, he was manumitted by that monarch and subsequently progressed through promotions, beginning with the job of second equerry. He had been a commander of a thousand, commander of the guard, and appointed governor of the province of Aleppo, under the reign of Amir Tumanbay, when the latter was proclaimed Sultan of Syria. He suffered a common fate.

Postwar, he pioneered aviation in Bolivia, including being the first aviator to fly across the Andes Mountains. Early life Donald Hudson was born on 21 December 1895 in Topeka, Kansas, but considered himself a native of Kansas City, Missouri.Over The Front: The Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914-1918, p. 45. World War I service Hudson served with the 27th Aero Squadron for the last year of the war, as he reported there as a Nieuport 28 pilot in November 1917. He did not score a victory until 2 July 1918, when he teamed with John MacArthur and four other pilots to destroy a pair of Fokker D.VIIs. Hudson then changed to a Spad XIII as the squadron re- equipped. On 1 August, he became an ace, scoring three victories during a protection patrol with the help of Jerry Vasconcells and a couple of other pilots. The action won him a DSC. His final victory was chalked up on 6 October 1918. South American aviation pioneer The Bolivian Curtiss 18T Wasp. The figure third from left appears to be Donald Hudson. Postwar, Hudson became an instructor with the Bolivian Air Force. During his stay in South America, he was credited as being the first to overfly the Andes Mountains. The President of Bolivia, José Gutiérrez Guerra, instructed Dr. Julio Zamora, Secretary of the Interior, to contract for a specially built Curtiss 18T Wasp triplane; they may have been introduced to Hudson during this transaction. At any rate, Hudson, his bride, and two mechanics accompanied the disassembled Wasp when it arrived in La Paz via railroad from Chile on 20 December 1919. Hudson was ranked as a lieutenant colonel and hired as chief pilot of the newly established Escuela de Aviación. Hudson began a series of record-setting flights; for instance, his use of the Wasp made him the only triplane pilot in South American history. On 17 April 1920, he took off from El Alto near La Paz and flew across the Andes for the mountain chain's first aerial crossing. Another flight took him to Lake Titicaca and set a South American altitude record of 8,294 meters (27, 211 feet) above sea level. Another high level flight like that, on 19 May, resulted in Hudson landing the Wasp with a mechanic passenger rendered unconscious by cold and the altitude. On a flight between Oruro and La Paz, Hudson crashed the Wasp near Sica Sica. The destruction of the plane seems to have ended his influence, as he was then investigated by Bolivian authorities. Later life On 11 June 1967, at Fort Meade, Maryland, Donald Hudson succumbed to the aftereffects of a stroke. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia. Legacy A monument to Hudson's pioneering flight across the Andes was erected in La Paz, Bolivia. Military honors and awards Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Donald Hudson, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action near Fere-en- Tardenois, France, August 1, 1918. A protection patrol of which Lieutenant Hudson was a member was attacked by a large formation of enemy planes. First Lieutenant Hudson was separated from the formation and forced to a low altitude by four enemy planes (Fokker type). He shot down one, drove off the other three, and started to our lines with a damaged machine, but was attacked by two planes. He shot down both of these planes and, by great perseverance and determination, succeeded in reaching our lines.

Opened sometime before 1910, an airfield was created from three farms by engineer William G. Trethewey (1865–1926). The airfield was located near present-day Hearst Circle and the Wishbone on a site in York Township (just outside Weston, Ontario). The grassy airfield was later used by French aviator Count Jacques Benjamin de Lesseps (1883–1927) and later renamed after him. The property remained in the hands of the Trethewey family after the death of Trethewey, but in 1928 Trethewey's son Fred sold it to airline Skyways Limited.Trethewey Airfield de Havilland Canada established their first home here in 1928 (building a small hangar) to build Gipsy Moth and Tiger Moth aircraft, but left for Downsview in 1929. Skyways remained owners until some time after 1931 and the airline moved to the Malton Airport. The farm and airfield was later re-developed as residential housing. No trace of the airfield remains in the area. Besides aircraft manufacturing, the airfield hosted air shows starting in 1910 (hosted by the Ontario Motor League). This airfield was one of many airfields in the greater Toronto area during the early 20th Century, but most of the airfields disappeared before World War II: * Armour Heights Field 1917-1919 * Barker Field 1927-1953 * Downsview Airfield 1929–present * Leaside Aerodrome 1927-1931 * Long Branch Aerodrome 1915-1919 * Toronto Aerodrome 1928-1939 Most of the airfield related buildings were temporary or converted from farm use. De Havilland's first factory was in an old vegetable warehouse because it had double doors wide enough to accommodate assembled aircraft. A larger hangar was built in 1929, but it was moved along with the aircraft manufacturer to Downsview. The later owners of the airfield, Skyways Limited, used the facilities to train pilots.

It is applied in (semi) arid zones at the mouth of a large river estuary or delta where a considerable tidal range (some 2 m) is present. The river discharge must be large enough to guarantee a sufficient flow of fresh water into the sea so that no salt water intrusion occurs in the river mouth. The irrigation is effectuated by digging tidal canals from the river shore into the main land that will guide the river water inland at high tide. For the irrigation to be effective the soil must have a high infiltration capacity to permit the entry of sufficient water in the soil to cover the evapotranspiration demand of the crop. At low tide, the canals and the soil drain out again, which promotes the aeration of the soil.

Koffing evolves into Weezing after reaching level 35. Created by Ken Sugimori, they first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels, various merchandise, spinoff titles, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. In Japanese, both characters are voiced by Unshō Ishizuka; in English Koffing is voiced by Michael Haigney, while Weezing is voiced by Eric Stuart. Known as the Poison Gas Pokémon, Koffing and Weezing are Poison-type Pokémon, filled with toxic gases which give them buoyancy and the ability to levitate. They are utilized by antagonists, Team Rocket, as well as the poison-themed Gym Leaders, Koga and Roxie. In the first few seasons of the related anime and subsequent printed adaption, Koffing and later its evolution Weezing served as the primary Pokémon utilized by James of Team Rocket. Their designs have been met with mixed reception, with sources such as GamesRadar stating approval for Koffing's appearance, while GameDaily described it as a \\"floating fart ball\\". In contrast, Weezing has been praised to a lesser extent, described as both an \\"abomination\\" and \\"horrific\\" by various sources. In Galar, Weezing has a regional variant that is Poison/Fairy. It has a signature Ability, Neutralizing Gas. Conception and characteristics Koffing and Weezing were conceived and developed by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, known outside Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue, in which players assumes the role of a Pokémon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon and use the creatures' special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Their English names are plays on the words \\"coughing\\" and \\"wheezing\\", meant to related to symptoms caused by the noxious fumes they emit. Originally, the characters were intended to be named \\"NY\\" and \\"LA\\" respectively in English localizations, intended as homages to the heavy pollution of American cities New York City and Los Angeles. Koffing Koffing resembles a large, floating blue-purple ball with various gas-emitting stud-like orifices surrounding its body (not unlike a naval mine, indeed, the Pokémon can even learn detonation attacks) save for its face, which appears as a smiling mouth with two eyes, and two small white upper fangs protruding from its mouth and a skull and crossbones symbol directly below said mouth. Once a Koffing has gained enough experience points, it evolves into a Weezing. Weezing's design appears as two light-purple Koffing fused together at the side, one larger and the other smaller than normal, additionally joined by an appendage from each connecting to a smaller, spherical mass. Both faces appear to be frowning, with the larger featuring two lower large fangs and two upper blunted teeth. On each, the skull has been changed to simpler oval, with the smaller lacking the crossbones. Koffing is 2 feet (60 cm) tall, while Weezing is 3 feet 11 inches (119 cm) tall. Weezing Designated as \\"Poison\\"-type Pokémon (and Poison/Fairy in Sword and Shield with its Galarian Form), Koffing and Weezing are filled with toxic gasses, which give them the ability to levitate and buoyancy. Their bodies can expand and deflate depending on mood and temperature, and may explode if agitated enough or put under intense heat. They will also expel gases from their body, the toxicity of which is relative to their mood. Weezing represents the result of two Koffings fusing together after their gases mix, and as one inflates, the other will deflate. Though the games make mention of triple-headed Weezing, none appear in any games or media. In the anime adaptation of the series, like most Pokémon both communicate by uttering their names or syllables thereof, and when doing so both heads of a Weezing will \\"speak\\" in unison. They live in urban and suburban areas, and feed on dust, fumes, garbage and toxic waste. Appearances In video games Koffing and Weezing first appears as two of the 151 species of Pokémon in the Pokémon Red and Blue Versions. They later appeared in several sequels, including Pokémon Gold and Silver, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the Red and Blue remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. Several NPCs utilized the pair, including the antagonists Team Rocket and poison-themed boss, Koga. This trend was continued in the sequel games Pokémon Gold and Silver, with Koga's daughter Janine replacing him as a boss, In Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, the boss character Roxie also uses Koffing and Weezing, and has Koffing as a prominent design motif in her gym. In the American release of Pokémon Red and Blue, the skull and crossbones symbol usually below Koffing's face was shown on its forehead. Every other game in the Pokémon series (and the Pokémon Anime) shows the symbol below its head. In Pokémon Stadium and its sequel, both Koga and Janine continue to utilize the Pokémon in the respective games as bosses. In Pokémon Puzzle League, Weezing is one of Team Rocket's Pokémon. In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, a Koffing serves as a third of Team Skull, acting as a partner to a Zubat and serving as a minor antagonist and for the course of the game. Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee featured Koffing and Weezing respectively as one of the Pokémon that could emerge when a Pokéball was thrown. Both had the same effect; upon appearing, they would release streams of toxic gas around them, dealing heavy damage to anyone who got caught. Weezing also appeared in Melee as the 5th float to appear on the Poke' Floats stage, while Koffing returned in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS as an enemy in the Smash Run mode. Koffing features in the 2016 augmented reality game Pokémon Go. The character caused controversy when there was a purported incident of it appearing in the game at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where a poison gas Pokémon would be considered offensive; the museum told players not to play Pokémon Go there and requested that the building be excluded from the game. In other media In the Pokémon anime series, a Koffing was used primarily by series antagonist James of Team Rocket, first appearing in the second episode. It later evolved into a Weezing, and was released in the sixth episode of Pokémon: Advanced to protect a group of Koffing and Ekans freed from captivity. This was over 260 episodes after its first appearance. Ash used a Weezing in a Pokémon League entrance exam in The Ultimate Test. It defeated the instructor's Flareon. Koffing's most recent appearance in the anime was under the ownership of Roxie in the Pokémon Black and White: Rival Destinies episode, \\"Rocking the Virbank Gym, Part 1.\\" Roxie used her Koffing in her Gym Battles, scoring many wins for her and defeating any Trainer who challenged her. Once Ash challenges Roxie for the Toxic Badge, Roxie's Koffing proceeds to defeat Ash's Boldore and Unfezant, but it was defeated by Ash's Leavanny. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, James's Weezing makes an appearance. It first appears as a Koffing in Pikachu's Excellent Adventure. All of its subsequent appearances, beginning in You Gotta Have Friends, are as a Weezing. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Koffing is seen as one of Koga's Pokémon. When Koga and Blue are ambushed by Agatha's Gengar in Volume 7, Koga uses Koffing's smoke to relay his tactical plan to Blue without Gengar noticing. Koga's daughter, Janine, also has a Weezing on her team. Promotion and reception Albert Bergesen, in The Depth of Shallow Culture, described Koffing and Weezing as examples of Japanese shinto practices, in this case the embodiment of coughing and wheezing as spiritual representations. IGN called Weezing \\"downright hideous\\", though questioned \\"who doesn't have a soft spot for it\\" and cited its presence in the anime. GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin praised Koffing as a \\"tried-and-true classic\\" Pokémon.http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemonrubyversion/review.html In terms of appearance, GameDaily ranked Koffing ninth on their list of the \\"Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pokémon\\", call it \\"basically a floating fart ball covered in pimples\\", and further described its design as bizarre and undelightful. However, InsertCredit's Tim Rodgers named it one of the top fifty video game icons, praising simplistic design and calling the skull-and-crossbones on its front \\"attitudinous\\", while noting it as a notch above other similar, round mascots in video games. GamesRadar stated it was difficult not to smile at its \\"Grimace-like face and chipper demeanor\\", though called its evolution \\"an abomination\\" and \\"very unsettling\\". Author Loredana Lipperini commented that while Weezing's skull indicates death, it is \\"not very smart\\".

The Ibonia predates the introduction of the printing press in Madagascar in the early part of the 19th century and as such has long been part of the poetic and storytelling oral traditions of the island. The first known transcription of the story was recorded in the 1870s and rapidly gained canonical status in the African literature tradition, being reprinted in numerous collections across Europe. Plot The tale begins with the conception and birth of Ibonia (Iboniamasiboniamanoro or \\"he of the clear and captivating glance\\") who demands to be betrothed to Joy-Giving girl while still in the womb of his mother, Beautiful-Rich. Before they can be married, however, Joy-Giving girl is taken away by Trouble-Stone man. Before setting off to win her back, he engages in a verbal duel with Great Echo and beats him. Great Echo in return offers Ibonia advice on how to pass a series of tests that will confront him on his quest to regain his wife. Ibonia visits his parents before setting off on the quest and his mother spurs him to prove himself by successfully fighting a series of powerful animal and human adversaries. She then attempts to dissuade him from his quest by presenting him with other wives, which he refuses. Ibonia displays his wit and physical prowess to overcome the challenges he encounters, including dressing himself in an Old Man's skin to get closer to Stone Man and Joy-Giving girl until his unprecedented talent for playing the valiha (a traditional bamboo tube zither) and fanorona (a traditional game played with stones on a board) gives him away. Ibonia wins his confrontation with Stone Man and escapes with Joy-Giving Girl. The two remain married for about ten years before the relationship is ended by Ibonia's peaceful death. Variations Three similar versions of the story as described above were collected by folklorists in the 1870s. However, six distinct versions in total have been recorded by folklorists and the variation from the base story increases with the distance from the Central Highlands. Among the Tanala and the Antakarana, for example, major plot features, such as the fate of the Stone Man or the character of the Joy-Giving Girl, can vary significantly.

This poem may be autobiographical. Stevenson was sickly growing up (probably tuberculosis), thus \\"when I am stronger\\" may refer to his hope of recovery. Further, his illness isolated him, so the loneliness expressed in the poem would fit well with his own childhood. Stevenson's poem also makes reference to the divide that exists between children and adults. This is seen when the speaker says that his father is a banker and rejects following in his footsteps into a similar career. Instead the child wishes to go gallivanting around the streets as the lamplighter does. The speaker in the poem makes his desire for adventure clear and seeks an escape from the normality of his life. For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door, And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more The lamplighter is reimagined by Stevenson into a wondrous and almost magical figure as seen through the speakers description. While the job of lighting lamps would be seen as banal by people at the time, it is instead seen as extraordinary by the speaker. The child sees the presence of lights at nighttime to be special and wishes to follow the Lamplighter into the same profession. Childhood is also represented as a time where choice does not really exist. The speaker believes that he is not able to choose what he wants to do because of his age. The poem explores choice and goes on to state that a person gains the ability to choose as they grow older and stronger which furthers the theme of maturation. There may also be some nostalgia reflected in the poem. In 1881, Stevenson published the essay, \\"A Plea For Gas Lamps,\\" in \\"Virginibus Puerisque, and Other Papers.\\" In this essay, he sentimentally upholds gas lamps against electric lights, describing electric light as \\"that ugly blinding glare\\" and \\"a lamp for a nightmare.\\" In the same essay, he describes the lamplighter as one punching holes in the night and as one worthy of being immortalized in a Greek myth, but one whose task has been overtaken by automatic electric ignition of the gas lights. Because Penny Whistles was published 4 years later, it may represent a similar theme.

It was of advanced all-metal construction and probably the first aircraft to use geodetic construction. Only one was built. Design and development In October 1920 Latécoère won a contract to build a four-engined biplane to meet the French requirement for a machine in category BP3. The initials stood for \\"bombardement et protection\\"; the 3, that it was a three- seater. The company were asked to build a single flying example and a structure for static load testing. The Latécoère 6 was an aircraft of advanced all-metal construction and striking appearance. The airframe was designed to have sufficient redundancy to be fail-safe and its fuselage may be the first geodetic aircraft structure. The Latécoère 6 was a sesquiplane, its lower wing having a span only 75% that of the upper plane and about 50% of its chord. The wings had straight and parallel edges but were markedly swept at about 7°. The leading edge of the narrow lower wing was slightly ahead of the upper. There were ailerons on both wings. It was a single bay biplane, the sesquiplane arrangement requiring the simple parallel inter-plane struts, streamlined and wide, to lean heavily outwards. The duralumin internal structure was complicated but based on double I section spars, nine in the upper wing and six in the lower. The wings were covered with thin steel. The tail unit was of similar construction. The tailplane was triangular and its incidence could be adjusted in flight for trim. It carried balanced elevators which reached well beyond the tailplane and which had a pair of mid-span cut-outs to allow the movement of a pair small fins. These moved along with a central rudder mounted on the short, square topped fin; the rudder's balance left a pronounced notch in the fin/rudder leading edge line. Structurally, perhaps the most advanced part of the Latécoère 6 was the fuselage, again a duralumin structure covered with thin steel. The geodetic structure was essentially two helices, one right-handed and the other left, joined at each intersection so making a continuous network. There were no longerons, but a series of well spaced circular frames stabilised the tube. There were four of these between the tail and the trailing edge. In contrast the much later Vickers aircraft, the Wellesley and Wellington used four longerons and no frames; the helices in the later aircraft had a much longer pitch. Forward of the trailing edge, the fuselage deepened rapidly, creating a little balcony from which a gunner could cover attacks from behind and below. A second rear gunner had a dorsal position just slightly aft. The pilot sat with his head at the wing leading edge and in front of him the fuselage fell rapidly away to another gunner's position in the extreme nose. The engines, initially four Salmson Z9 water- cooled radials were wing mounted in tractor-pusher pairs driving four-blade propellers. The water-cooled engine, with its radiator behind the propeller allowed neat, tight and well streamlined cowlings, mounted above the lower wing on a series of short struts. Each pair had two struts connecting the lower cowling to the upper fuselage and another strut ran from the upper cowling outwards to the upper wing. The main undercarriage was a divided axle type, each single bungee sprung main wheel carried on two legs immediately below the engine, with a pair of struts inboard to the lower fuselage. Just forward of this wide track undercarriage ran a streamlined transverse skid, from wheel to wheel, mounted on the lower wing. The Latécoère 6 first flew in the summer of 1924 at Francazal, piloted by Achille Enderlin. It soon became obvious that the aircraft was underpowered, perhaps because of weight gains during construction. Despite this and damage sustained during testing there was considerable official interest and a new contract enabled Latécoère to modify the aircraft to take four more modern and powerful engines, Gnome et Rhône 9A Jupiter engines. This revised machine was known as the Latécoère 6 M. Externally, as well as the obvious change to partially-cowled air-cooled engines with their protruding cylinder heads, a very broad chord strut, narrowest at its midpoint now braced each engine to the upper wing, and each single main wheel was replaced by a pair. The 6 M first flew in 1925 and made a successful series of tests towards the end of that year. Meanwhile, the static specimen was undergoing stress tests with excellent results and for a while there was a serious chance of a production order. In the end, that never came as the advanced airframe was judged too complex to build and too expensive. Latécoère regarded it as a ruinous exercise.

The materials employ a periodic, cellular structure. The subwavelength periodicity distinguishes photonic metamaterials from photonic band gap or photonic crystal structures. The cells are on a scale that is magnitudes larger than the atom, yet much smaller than the radiated wavelength, are on the order of nanometers. In a conventional material, the response to electric and magnetic fields, and hence to light, is determined by atoms. In metamaterials, cells take the role of atoms in a material that is homogeneous at scales larger than the cells, yielding an effective medium model. Responsive Photonic Nanostructures: Smart Nanoscale Optical Materials Editor: Yadong Yin RSC Cambridge 2013 https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-84973-653-4 Some photonic metamaterials exhibit magnetism at high frequencies, resulting in strong magnetic coupling. This can produce a negative index of refraction in the optical range. Potential applications include cloaking and transformation optics. Photonic crystals differ from PM in that the size and periodicity of their scattering elements are larger, on the order of the wavelength. Also, a photonic crystal is not homogeneous, so it is not possible to define values of ε (permittivity) or u (permeability). History While researching whether or not matter interacts with the magnetic component of light, Victor Veselago (1967) envisioned the possibility of refraction with a negative sign, according to Maxwell's equations. A refractive index with a negative sign is the result of permittivity, ε < 0 (less than zero) and magnetic permeability, μ < 0 (less than zero). Veselago's analysis has been cited in over 1500 peer reviewed articles and many books. Alternate copy here. A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal materialIn the mid-1990s, metamaterials were first seen as potential technologies for applications such as nanometer-scale imaging and cloaking objects. As of 2015, metamaterial antennas were commercially available.Responsive Photonic Nanostructures, Editor: Yadong Yin, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2013, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-84973-776-0 Negative permeability was achieved with a split-ring resonator (SRR) as part of the subwavelength cell. The SRR achieved negative permeability within a narrow frequency range. This was combined with a symmetrically positioned electric conducting post, which created the first negative index metamaterial, operating in the microwave band. Experiments and simulations demonstrated the presence of a left-handed propagation band, a left-handed material. The first experimental confirmation of negative index of refraction occurred soon after, also at microwave frequencies. Negative permeability and negative permittivity metamaterial lattice used to demonstrate negative refraction. The array of square split-ring resonators gives the material a negative magnetic permeability, whereas the array of straight wires gives it a negative permittivity Natural materials, such as precious metals, can achieve ε < 0 up to the visible frequencies. However, at terahertz, infrared and visible frequencies, natural materials have a very weak magnetic coupling component, or permeability. In other words, susceptibility to the magnetic component of radiated light can be considered negligible. Negative index metamaterials behave contrary to the conventional \\"right-handed\\" interaction of light found in conventional optical materials. Hence, these are dubbed left-handed materials or negative index materials (NIMs), among other nomenclatures. Only fabricated NIMs exhibit this capability. Photonic crystals, like many other known systems, can exhibit unusual propagation behavior such as reversal of phase and group velocities. However, negative refraction does not occur in these systems.Pendry, J., \\"New electromagnetic materials emphasize the negative, \\" Physics World, 1–5, 2001 Naturally occurring ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials can achieve magnetic resonance, but with significant losses. In natural materials such as natural magnets and ferrites, resonance for the electric (coupling) response and magnetic (coupling) response do not occur at the same frequency. Optical frequency Photonic metamaterial SRRs have reached scales below 100 nanometers, using electron beam and nanolithography. One nanoscale SRR cell has three small metallic rods that are physically connected. This is configured as a U shape and functions as a nano-inductor. The gap between the tips of the U-shape function as a nano-capacitor. Hence, it is an optical nano-LC resonator. These \\"inclusions\\" create local electric and magnetic fields when externally excited. These inclusions are usually ten times smaller than the vacuum wavelength of the light c0 at the resonance frequency. The inclusions can then be evaluated by using an effective medium approximation. PMs display a magnetic response with useful magnitude at optical frequencies. This includes negative permeability, despite the absence of magnetic materials. Analogous to ordinary optical material, PMs can be treated as an effective medium that is characterized by effective medium parameters ε(ω) and μ(ω), or similarly, εeff and μeff. The negative refractive index of PMs in the optical frequency range was experimentally demonstrated in 2005 by Shalaev et al. (at the telecom wavelength λ = 1.5 μm) and by Brueck et al. (at λ = 2 μm) at nearly the same time . Effective medium model An effective (transmission) medium approximation describes material slabs that, when reacting to an external excitation, are \\"effectively\\" homogeneous, with corresponding \\"effective\\" parameters that include \\"effective\\" ε and µ and apply to the slab as a whole. Individual inclusions or cells may have values different from the slab. However, there are cases where the effective medium approximation does not hold and one needs to be aware of its applicability. Coupling magnetism Negative magnetic permeability was originally achieved in a left-handed medium at microwave frequencies by using arrays of split-ring resonators. In most natural materials, the magnetically coupled response starts to taper off at frequencies in the gigahertz range, which implies that significant magnetism does not occur at optical frequencies. The effective permeability of such materials is unity, μeff = 1. Hence, the magnetic component of a radiated electromagnetic field has virtually no effect on natural occurring materials at optical frequencies. In metamaterials the cell acts as a meta-atom, a larger scale magnetic dipole, analogous to the picometer-sized atom. For meta- atoms constructed from gold, μ < 0 can be achieved at telecommunication frequencies but not at visible frequencies. The visible frequency has been elusive because the plasma frequency of metals is the ultimate limiting condition. Design and fabrication Optical wavelengths are much shorter than microwaves, making subwavelength optical metamaterials more difficult to realize. Microwave metamaterials can be fabricated from circuit board materials, while lithography techniques must be employed to produce PMs. Successful experiments used a periodic arrangement of short wires or metallic pieces with varied shapes. In a different study the whole slab was electrically connected. Fabrication techniques include electron beam lithography, nanostructuring with a focused ion beam and interference lithography. In 2014 a polarization-insensitive metamaterial prototype was demonstrated to absorb energy over a broad band (a super-octave) of infrared wavelengths. The material displayed greater than 98% measured average absorptivity that it maintained over a wide ±45° field-of-view for mid- infrared wavelengths between 1.77 and 4.81 μm. One use is to conceal objects from infrared sensors. Palladium provided greater bandwidth than silver or gold. A genetic algorithm randomly modified an initial candidate pattern, testing and eliminating all but the best. The process was repeated over multiple generations until the design became effective. The metamaterial is made of four layers on a silicon substrate. The first layer is palladium, covered by polyimide (plastic) and a palladium screen on top. The screen has sub-wavelength cutouts that block the various wavelengths. A polyimide layer caps the whole absorber. It can absorb 90 percent of infrared radiation at up to a 55 degree angle to the screen. The layers do not need accurate alignment. The polyimide cap protects the screen and helps reduce any impedance mismatch that might occur when the wave crosses from the air into the device. Research   One-way transmission  In 2015 visible light joined microwave and infrared NIMs in propagating light in only one direction. (\\"mirrors\\" instead reduce light transmission in the reverse direction, requiring low light levels behind the mirror to work.) The material combined two optical nanostructures: a multi-layered block of alternating silver and glass sheets and metal grates. The silver-glass structure is a \\"hyperbolic\\" metamaterial, which treats light differently depending on which direction the waves are traveling. Each layer is tens of nanometers thick—much thinner than visible light's 400 to 700 nm wavelengths, making the block opaque to visible light, although light entering at certain angles can propagate inside the material. Adding chromium grates with sub-wavelength spacings bent incoming red or green light waves enough that they could enter and propagate inside the block. On the opposite side of the block, another set of grates allowed light to exit, angled away from its original direction. The spacing of the exit grates was different from that of the entrance grates, bending incident light so that external light could not enter the block from that side. Around 30 times more light passed through in the forward direction than in reverse. The intervening blocks reduced the need for precise alignment of the two grates with respect to each other. Such structures hold potential for applications in optical communication—for instance, they could be integrated into photonic computer chips that split or combine signals carried by light waves. Other potential applications include biosensing using nanoscale particles to deflect light to angles steep enough to travel through the hyperbolic material and out the other side.  Lumped circuit elements  By employing a combination of plasmonic and non-plasmonic nanoparticles, lumped circuit element nanocircuits at infrared and optical frequencies appear to be possible. Conventional lumped circuit elements are not available in a conventional way. Subwavelength lumped circuit elements proved workable in the microwave and radio frequency (RF) domain. The lumped element concept allowed for element simplification and circuit modularization. Nanoscale fabrication techniques exist to accomplish subwavelength geometries.  Cell design  Metals such as gold, silver, aluminum and copper conduct currents at RF and microwave frequencies. At optical frequencies characteristics of some noble metals are altered. Rather than normal current flow, plasmonic resonances occur as the real part of the complex permittivity becomes negative. Therefore, the main current flow is actually the electric displacement current density ∂D / ∂t, and can be termed as the “flowing optical current\\". At subwavelength scales the cell's impedance becomes dependent on shape, size, material and the optical frequency illumination. The particle's orientation with the optical electric field may also help determine the impedance. Conventional silicon dielectrics have the real permittivity component εreal > 0 at optical frequencies, causing the nanoparticle to act as a capacitive impedance, a nanocapacitor. Conversely, if the material is a noble metal such as gold or silver, with εreal < 0, then it takes on inductive characteristics, becoming a nanoinductor. Material loss is represented as a nano-resistor. Tunability The most commonly applied scheme to achieve a tunable index of refraction is electro-optical tuning. Here the change in refractive index is proportional to either the applied electric field, or is proportional to the square modulus of the electric field. These are the Pockels effect and Kerr effects, respectively. An alternative is to employ a nonlinear optical material and depend on the optical field intensity to modify the refractive index or magnetic parameters. Layering Stacking layers produces NIMs at optical frequencies. However, the surface configuration (non-planar, bulk) of the SRR normally prevents stacking. Although a single-layer SRR structure can be constructed on a dielectric surface, it is relatively difficult to stack these bulk structures due to alignment tolerance requirements. A stacking technique for SRRs was published in 2007 that uses dielectric spacers to apply a planarization procedure to flatten the SRR layer. It appears that arbitrary many layers can be made this way, including any chosen number of unit cells and variant spatial arrangements of individual layers.  Frequency doubling  In 2014 researchers announced a 400 nanometer thick frequency-doubling non-linear mirror that can be tuned to work at near-infrared to mid-infrared to terahertz frequencies. The material operates with much lower intensity light than traditional approaches. For a given input light intensity and structure thickness, the metamaterial produced approximately one million times higher intensity output. The mirrors do not require matching the phase velocities of the input and output waves. It can produce giant nonlinear response for multiple nonlinear optical processes, such as second harmonic, sum- and difference-frequency generation, as well a variety of four-wave mixing processes. The demonstration device converted light with a wavelength of 8000 to 4000 nanometers. The device is made of a stack of thin layers of indium, gallium and arsenic or aluminum, indium and arsenic. 100 of these layers, each between one and twelve nanometers thick, were faced on top by a pattern of asymmetrical, crossed gold nanostructures that form coupled quantum wells and a layer of gold on the bottom. Potential applications include remote sensing and medical applications that call for compact laser systems. Other Dyakonov surface waves (DSW) relate to birefringence related to photonic crystals, metamaterial anisotropy. Recently photonic metamaterial operated at 780 nanometer (near-infrared), 813 nm and 772 nm.

He was drafted by the Giants in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. College career Sash played safety while with the Iowa Hawkeyes. He had 13 career interceptions for the Hawkeyes, which was five shy of the school record for career interceptions, originally set by Nile Kinnick from 1937–1939. He holds the Iowa record for career interception return yards with 392, a mark which also ranks fifth in Big Ten history. Sash was named to the 2010 preseason Lott Trophy watchlist, a trophy named in honor of former college and Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott and presented annually to the college football defensive player of the year. He was also named to the 2010 preseason Bronko Nagurski watch list, awarded annually by the Football Writers Association of America to the nation's best defensive player. Professional career On January 13, 2011, Sash decided to forgo his senior season to make himself eligible for the 2011 NFL Draft. He was selected in the sixth round by the New York Giants and was a member of the Super Bowl XLVI championship squad. In July 2012, he was suspended for four games by the NFL after testing positive for Adderall, which is on the league's list of banned substances. Sash said in a statement that he took the drug legally and \\"under a doctor's care for an anxiety condition\\" to help him with public speaking. Sash was cut from the New York Giants on August 31, 2013. Personal life and death On May 10, 2014, Sash was arrested for public intoxication and interference with public acts. On September 8, 2015, Sash was found dead in his Oskaloosa, Iowa, home around 8 a.m. local time. He was 27. The autopsy report concluded that his death was caused by a mixture of drugs. On January 26, 2016, five months after his death, Sash's family released the results of testing performed on his brain, confirming that he was suffering from stage 2 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by head injuries, at the time of his death.

Edward Wormold Edward Wormold is the owner of several properties on Coronation Street up until the late 70s. As such, he makes occasional visits when needed. Gradually all the houses are bought by the residents of the Street, and Wormold last appears in September. His brother Alfried appears in 1967 and son Douglas appears in 1974. Norman Lindley Norman Lindley is the estranged husband of shopkeeper Florrie Lindley. His arrival shocks Florrie's friends and neighbours, who had believed she was widowed. Norman works overseas as an engineer and has returned to the country to ask Florrie for a divorce. Whilst in the area he takes a fancy to Elsie Tanner and they date, but when Florrie confesses she still has feelings for Norman, Elsie gallantly breaks it off. Florrie has her hopes of rekindling the romance dashed however, when Norman is called back to work and abruptly leaves. The couple finally decides to give their marriage another go when Norman comes back for Florrie later in the year, and they leave for a new start together. Roger Wain Roger Wain is a friend of Lucille Hewitt's, whom she meets when the play opposite each other in a local production. Lucille instantly takes a shine to Roger and takes him home to meet her guardians Annie and Jack, who approve of the developing relationship between the pair. Eventually however, class differences prove too much for Roger and Lucille, and they drift apart. Peter Barlow Susan Barlow Lionel Petty Lionel Petty arrives on Coronation Street as the new owner of the Corner Shop, which he previously bought from Florrie Lindley. He is an ex-Sergeant Major, and life as a shopkeeper is never his game. Lionel fails to fit in on the Street and leaves for Wales in January 1966 to go into business with his brother. Sid Lambert Sid Lambert is the manager of the local football club where David Barlow takes a job as coach until David's knee injury forces him out. He returns briefly in 1970, after doing some work for Alan Howard and is angry when Alan is unable to pay him. Sid threatens to sue Alan, along with several other people to whom Alan owes money, if he does not pay them what they are owed. Alan's accountant asks Sid to give Alan time to come up with the money. Sid is reluctant but is outvoted by the other creditors. He asks Alan's accountant to provide evidence that Alan's hairdressing salon in Leeds is actually owned by his ex-wife. Tom Schofield Tom Schofield is Ena Sharples's great-nephew, grandson of her brother Tom who emigrated to the US in 1912. The elder Tom has raised a family in the US, fathering a son also named Tom who has had three children, including Tom. Having lost touch with his family in Weatherfield not long after leaving the country, the elder Tom asks his grandson to find Ena and persuade her to come and stay at his log cabin between Omaha and Sioux City, Nebraska, putting up the air fare himself, when the latter is due in the UK for work purposes. The younger Tom works for a travel agent in Omaha, who does package tours of Europe and he has been dispatched to the UK to check out the hotels. In order to trace Ena, Tom uses a firm of solicitors who put an ad in a local Weatherfield paper asking her to contact them, using her maiden name and last known address of 65 Inkerman Street. Ena, now a widow and living in the vestry of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, sees the ad and gets in touch. She is informed only that someone would soon contact her and has no idea who is behind the ad until Tom turns up at her door. Ena is very happy to learn that her brother is alive and well and still thinks about her. Tom acquaints her with the Schofield line going back to her brother and reads a letter from him in which he talks about his childhood memories of her, which moves her to tears. Startled to receive the invitation to visit him, Ena wavers on accepting as she is set in her ways and is fearful about flying for the first time. It is only when Annie Walker scoffs at the very idea of her going to America that she announces she is taking up her brother's offer. Tom is in the area a little while longer before flying home with Ena. In that time he samples Ena's Lancashire hotpot, and defends her when Lionel Petty confronts her over a neighbourhood boycott of the Corner Shop she's enacted. He also has a minor spat with Len Fairclough when Elsie Tanner accepts a drink from Tom causing a jealous Len to walk out of the Rovers Return Inn. Over the next eight years, Tom marries Faye-Marie and settles in Manchester, Connecticut. In 1973, Tom and Faye-Marie plan a visit to the UK to see the Manchester Festival. A week before they leave, Ena's brother Tom dies in his sleep; Tom and Faye-Marie deliver this news to Ena in person upon their arrival in Weatherfield. Ena takes the news well, finding comfort in the fact that he hadn't suffered. Tom is not interested in sight-seeing and spends most of the three-week stay in Coronation Street, socialising with Ena's friends and neighbours. He also helps out at the Community Centre's Manchester Festival day by serving at the juice counter. On most of these occasions, he is not accompanied by his wife. A notable exception is the Street outing to Woburn Abbey. Tom makes the most of the visit by bringing along his camera and taking photographs of the animals at Woburn Safari Park. He and Faye-Marie are delighted when Ena introduces them to The Duke of Bedford. Unlike her husband, Faye-Marie loves to visit new places and wants to experience as much British culture and history as she can. She fancies herself an intellectual and seeks out others for the type of stimulating conversation she does not get from Tom. Despite this, their marriage is a happy one. While in Weatherfield, she latches onto Ken Barlow, a fellow liberal-minded teacher. Their attachment worries Ena, who asks Tom and Faye-Marie why they hardly spend any time together. Tom explains to her that they had an open marriage, which concerns her all the more. Faye-Marie and Ken convince Ena that they are only friends and when Tom demonstrates faith in his wife, Ena accepts that their marriage works for them, even if she does not understand it. The Schofields later return home. Arthur Walker Arthur Walker is the brother of Jack Walker who often runs the Rovers while Jack and his wife Annie are indisposed. He males his last appearance in 1969, visiting Jack in hospital after he is injured in the coach crash. Arthur takes on the characteristics previously shown by their brother Jim Walker. Clara Midgeley Clara Midgeley is the caretaker employed at the Mission in the absence of regular employee Ena Sharples. During her stay on the Street she makes good friends with Albert Tatlock and the pair holiday together in Cleveleys, with Albert unaware that Clara has previously disclosed to Minnie Caldwell that she is in fact falling in love with him. On the trip Clara decides to propose marriage to Albert, but is disappointed when he turns her down, reasoning that he is far too set in his ways to ever marry again. Following this, Albert cuts the holiday short to return home and Clara, devastated, is never seen again. Nellie Harvey Nellie Harvey appears intermittently from 1965 to 1976. She and her husband Arthur are landlord and lady of The Laughing Donkey, another local pub in Weatherfield. Nellie was a member of the Weatherfield Ladies Licensed Victualers. She is a lifelong 'friend' of Annie Walker but in reality they are always trying to score points off each other. Ted Bates Ted Bates is an old friend of Albert Tatlock's who moves into No.1 to escape the old folks' home his daughter had packed him off to. Albert and Ted fights for his rights to stay, but his daughter gets the authorities involved and a defeated Ted returns to the home. Bob Maxwell Robert \\"Bob\\" Maxwell is a solicitor whom Elsie Tanner meets in the Fox and Hound pub during a desperate attempt to find love outside of Coronation Street. After a night of flirting, Bob drives Elsie home, and on the way they stopp in a lay-by where he tells her how unhappy he is in his marriage. Once they drive off, Bob suffers a fatal heart attack and crashes the car. Panicked, Elsie flees the scene but the police track her down soon enough and she is forced to give evidence. Moira Maxwell Moira Maxwell is the wife of Bob Maxwell, who dies while taking Elsie Tanner home. Moira attacks Elsie at the Coroner's Court hearing, accusing her of luring her husband away. Jim Mount Jim Mount is an Irish engineer who briefly flirts with Elsie Tanner before moving into No.13 with the Ogdens. He is overjoyed when his old girlfriend Brenda Riley is installed as manageress at the Rovers in the temporary absence of the Walkers, but she refuses to resume their relationship and goes out with Len Fairclough instead. Brenda and Jim eventually leave Weatherfield together after the Walkers return to find the Rovers in disarray. Frank Turner Frank Turner is a customer of the Rovers who blackmails Jack Walker when he finds underage Lucille Hewitt managing the bar in his absence. Frank demands money for his silence and the strain causes Jack to collapse. When the regulars discover what is going on they decide on teaching Frank a lesson. He is beaten up in the alleyway behind the Rovers and Stan Ogden is celebrated for his handiwork, only for them all to learn it was in fact Jerry Booth who had done the deed. 1965 *, Coronation Street Coronation Street ","title":"List of Coronation Street characters (1965)"},{"id":"24706296","text":"Tim Greve (20 February 1928 - 27 April 1986) was a Norwegian historian, biographer, civil servant, diplomat and newspaper editor.

In 1954 he married jurist Marit Nansen, daughter of architect Odd Nansen and granddaughter of Eva and Fridtjof Nansen. They resided at Fornebu in Bærum, incidentally in the road Fridtjof Nansens vei. Career Greve attended the Nansen Academy, and then studied history at the University of Oslo, graduating in 1952. He was attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1951 to 1974. He served as Norwegian delegate to NATO and to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and was later secretary for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Halvard Lange. Holding office from 1956 to 1960, he was the first political secretary (today known as political advisor) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was two years at the Norwegian embassy in Bonn, and later served as Secretary for the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Parliament of Norway. He then returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as assistant secretary from 1966 to 1967 and deputy under-secretary of state from 1967 to 1974. He served as Director for the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1974 to 1977 and Secretary for the Norwegian Nobel Committee. He was chief editor for the newspaper Verdens Gang from 1978 to 1986. In 1978, two long-serving co-editors Oskar Hasselknippe and Vegard Sletten resigned, but Greve had Andreas Norland as a co-editor. During Greve's period as editor-in-chief Verdens Gang became the largest newspaper in Norway, surpassing Aftenposten in 1981. Reportedly, Greve was not genuinely content with this development. He viewed sensationalist journalism, which reached the front page of Verdens Gang now and then, with dismay. From 1982 he chaired the Broadcasting Council. He was succeeded by Helge Seip on 1 January 1986. Greve wrote several books. His biography of his wife's grandfather, polar explorer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Fridtjof Nansen, was published in two volumes in 1973 and 1974. His wrote two volumes on World War II in Bergen, Bergen i krig I-II (1978-1979), and a book on espionage in Norway prior to the war, Spionjakt i Norge (1982). From 1982 to his death he was the deputy board chairman of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Greve was decorated Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1968 as well as Commander, First Class of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog. He also received the Bundesverdienstkreuz from West Germany. He died in April 1986 in Oslo, from cancer.  Select bibliography  * Det Norske Storting gjennom 150 år III.

The result was a complex sound derived from world sounds, mainly rooted in Latin American folk music such as Puerto Rican bomba y plena, salsa and tango and also other foreign influenced music such as rock en español. Mixed with thoughtful (and sometimes crude) lyricism guided by an anti-colonialism discourse, Latin American sociopolitical content and racial pride, it gave listeners a smooth blend of danceable rhythms and intellectual dialogue. History The precursor is arguably one of the founding fathers of reggaeton: Vico C, whose albums relied heavily on hip hop acoustics, keyboards and reggae roots. Xplosión (1993), Aquel Que Había Muerto (1998) and Desahogo (2005) are good examples. Rise of a new sound The starting point of alternative reggaeton per se is considered by many to be the album El Abayarde, the 2002 debut of Tego Calderón. The blend of Puerto Rican folk music, known as bomba y plena two Afro-Puerto Rican genres, and a steady beats of hip hop and classical reggaeton served as a base for the new variant. The album became a major success, launching the underground status of Calderón to the pinnacle of the Spanish speaking MC's. Breakthrough The breakthrough album of what is considered alternative reggaeton came in 2005 with the self-titled debut album of Puerto Rican duo Calle 13. The song \\"Atrévete-te-te\\" from the album became a big success on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, peaking at #15.[ Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Calle 13] This helped the genre gain more media exposure. The background of the Puerto Rican duo provided a fresh source for the subgenre. Producer and multi-instrumentalist Visitante was formerly educated in music, and eventually formed part of a rock en español and Brazilian batucada band called Bayanga, which provided a diametrical point of view from the traditional caserío-inspired dancehall synthesizer sound from most albums. Lyricist Residente was highly educated, having earned a Masters of Fine Arts in the Savannah College of Art and Design, which contributed to his crafted lyricism and purposeful sarcasm. The main asset of the album was that it provided more than just danceable tracks, and it began to question the inner perception of Puerto Rican identity and the acceptance of foreign models as a pertinent solution to Latin American issues. This is evident in the Diddy mocking song \\"Pi-di-di-di\\". Some criticism has been raised of Residente by its close similarity to Eminem's songs and whole 'enfant terrible' ethos. The sophomore and junior album of the band have further expanded this realm creating a mature product that provides sexual discussions and ethical questioning. For this reason the band has achieve critical success winning multiple accolades including five Grammys.Negrón-Muntaner, Frances; Chapter Poetry of Filth: The (Post) Reggaetonic Lyrics of Calle 13 from book Reggaeton; Duke University Press, NC; 2009. They have also purposely distanced themselves from other rappers in their appearance by using simple tropical clothes with bright colors, and (a good-luck charm necklace made by local craftsman) instead of the bling-bling persona derived from American rappers and completely decontextualized from the warm climate of the Caribbean. Other exponents Much like the alternative wing of hip hop (with artists such as Mos Def and Talib Kweli), both Tego Calderón and Calle 13 have found a solid fan-base and success in the indie scene and mainstream scenarios. But other artists such as 7-9 (sometimes referred to as SieteNueve) and Intifada still remain relatively unknown. Although their content is deliberately Nationalistic and completely in Spanish, much like the other alternative artists, they do not consider themselves reggaeton singers, but hip-hoppers. The only track to receive some airplay in major stations was 7-9's \\"Edúcate o Quédate Calla'o\\",Torres, Jaime; Article: Tapaboca a Daddy Yankee, Newspaper El Nuevo Dia, Puerto Rico; http://www.elnuevodia.com/diario/noticia/musica/flash!/tapaboca_a_yankee a dis track against Daddy Yankee arguing that his support to Sen. John McCain in the USA primaries was inappropriate and was setting a bad example for the youth. Another artist somewhat associated to the subgenre is producer Danny Fornaris, due to his protest track \\"Querido FBI\\", whom Calle 13 wrote in honor of Machetero leader Filiberto Ojeda Ríos after he was allegedly assassinated by the FBI. However, Fornaris' constant collaborations with mainstream reggaeton singers, such as Don Omar and Tito El Bambino, has devaluated him in the indie scene, contributing to a sellout stigma.

It was founded in 1976 by three brothers - , and - and often works with political cabaret artist Gerhard Polt. The name derives from \\"Beerenmoos\\" (berry bog), a part of the Haspelmoor in the district of Fürstenfeldbruck that was planned to be transformed in a large airport and a waste dump, and \\"Blosn\\", a Bavarian word for \\"group\\". History The band was founded in 1976 by brothers (born 1 May 1953, Willprechtszell), (born 3 December 1959, Günzlhofen) and (born 10 October 1958, Günzlhofen) in Fürstenfeldbruck. Three years later, their first hit Gott mit dir, du Land der BayWa, was broadcast on the Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR) television channel. The song lampoons the Bavarian national anthem changing the text to criticize massive use of fertilizer in Bavarian farming (which was at that time mostly sold by the BayWa). Following the broadcast, the band as well as the journalists at the BR were attacked for such a \\"sacrilege\\". This led to the BR not broadcasting the music of the group for years. In 1979, the group first went on stage together with Gerhard Polt. The group announced in August 2011, they will play a final concert in January 2012 and then disband. They gave their last concert in the city of Fürth, Bavaria on January, 18th, 2012. Music style The band specializes in combining satirical lyrics with folk melodies to create political songs, mostly endorsing causes of groups of the political left, like the German Green party or the Young Socialists. Aside from their main musical style, they also recorded multiple albums with children's songs together with their own children and have acted in theater shows. Causes The band has used their music to protest against multiple projects; amongst them were the planned nuclear reprocessing plant Wackersdorf plant in Wackersdorf, the Bundesautobahn 94, as well as several scandals of the long time governing party of Bavaria, the Christian Social Union of Bavaria. Critical reactions In 1997, the band was denied the Upper Bavarian prize for culture for being too \\"leftist\\". In 2001, the Bavarian ministry of education disallowed the song Gott mit dir, du Land der BayWa, which was the band's first hit, from being used in a song book for the eighth grade for \\"lampooning the Bavarian national anthem\\" and ordered the whole order of books, 75,000 copies, to be destroyed.

It is served by Brussels Central Station, as well as by the metro stations Parc/Park and Trône/Troon. History Interior of the nave and choir The medieval abbey church that originally stood on this location was demolished by command of Charles Alexander of Lorraine, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands, during his expansive urban planning projects, despite having escaped the great fire of 1731 that destroyed the nearby Coudenberg Palace. The new church was built in line with / on its present location on the Place Royale/Koningsplein. Construction of the facade was started by architect Gilles-Barnabé Guimard after the designs of Jean-Benoît-Vincent Barré (1775). The first stone was solemnly laid by Charles Alexander of Lorraine on 12 February 1776. The portico was finished in 1780. The nave, transept, choir and sacristy were built under supervision of Louis Montoyer in 1785–1786. After the consecration of the building, it was used as an abbey and parish church at the same time. Moreover, it was the official church of the court of the Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands. The present building was designed to serve as the Church of the Abbey of St. James on the Coudenberg and therefore has a deep extended choir with place for choir stalls for the monks. Floor plan of the church, from Choix des Monuments by Pierre-Jacques Goetghebuer (1827) During the French Revolution, the abbey was suspended and the church was made into a Temple of Reason, and then later into a Temple of Law. The church was returned to Catholic control in 1802. On 21 July 1831, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha took the oath that made him H.M. Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians, on the front steps of the church. The building lost somewhat of its typical neoclassical temple-like appearance by the addition in the 19th-century of a bell tower (after the design of Tilman- François Suys) and a coloured fresco by Jean Portaels on the pediment. The church's interior and facade have been protected through royal decree since 2 December 1959.

Stockhausen came from Thüringen. In 1805 he joined the Feldjägerregiment of the Prussian Army as an officer cadet. In 1808 he became a second lieutenant and changed over to the Garde-Jäger-Bataillon. In 1813 and 1814 he participated in the War of the Sixth Coalition. In 1824 he was made a Major and in 1830 was assigned to the General Staff. From 1840 to 1842 he was the Chief of Staff of the Guard Corps, that was then commanded by Prince Wilhelm. In 1845 he was made a Major General. A short while later he was made inspector of the garrisons of the German Confederation's fortresses. In 1848 he was placed in command of the 9. Infanteriebrigade in Posen. Before he could take up this position, however, he was made Chief of Staff of the troops under General Friedrich Graf von Wrangel in the First Schleswig War. By the time Von Stockhausen joined up with the troops, the Danish units had already withdrawn to the islands. In July 1848 he was placed in command of the 1st Division in Königsberg. He aimed to become minister of war, however, and tried to campaign for himself in Berlin. Since he met with no success, he asked to be retired. This request was granted when he was made a Lieutenant General, with appropriate pension rights. But there were still political elements that wanted to see Von Stockhausen as minister of war. Partly for this reason, Von Stockhausen successfully stood for election to the second chamber of the Prussian parliament. He was a member of the parliament until he resigned his mandate on 9 May 1849. There, he belonged very much to the right wing, but did not join any parliamentary party. After Karl von Strotha's resignation on 27 February 1850, he was made minister of war. For a time, he also had hopes of becoming Prime Minister. However, there were personal as well as political differences between Stockhausen and King Frederick William IV. Amongst the personal matters, the latter accused Stockhausen of being an \\"enemy of Pietism\\", and thus, of Christianity. Politically, Stockhausen, like his predecessor, supported the view that royal orders concerning personnel issues (such as promotions) constitutionally had to be counter-signed by the minister of war. After the appointment of Joseph von Radowitz as Foreign Minister, Stockhausen tried to avert a looming war with Austria. He was even falsely accused of deliberately dragging his feet in the preparations for such a war. His relationship with the King remained tense and Stockhausen asked to be dismissed more than once. The King delayed doing so however, as there was no suitable replacement. When Stockhausen refused to defend in parliament higher pay for the officers of certain Guard regiments, he was dismissed on 31 December 1851. He then held the post of chairman of the general medals commission (Generalordenskommission) until 1853. He was also a member of the first chamber of the Prussian parliament in 1852-53.

She was the abbess of Beaumont-lès-Tours Abbey. Biography Early life Henriette Louise was born at the Palace of Versailles, the seventh child and fifth daughter of Louis III de Bourbon, Prince of Condé and his wife, Louise-Françoise de Bourbon. Henriette Louise's father was a grandson of le Grand Condé, and her mother was the eldest surviving legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. Henriette Louise grew up at Fontevraud Abbey. She was one of nine children. Henriette Louise was a member of the House of Condé, a cadet branch of the reigning House of Bourbon. As a result, she was a princesse du Sang at court. This rank allowed Henriette the style of Serene Highness. From birth, she was known as Mademoiselle de Vermandois, Vermandois being a county that had long belonged to the House of Condé. She acquired the lands of Montond in 1710, but sold them to her sister Louise Anne in 1732. Marriage negotiation In 1725, Henriette Louise as well as her sister Élisabeth Alexandrine was on a list of potential brides presented to King Louis XV. Her name had been placed on the list by her brother, the duc de Bourbon, who was Louis XV's chief minister. Along with his mistress, Madame de Prie, the duke wanted to make his sister the queen in the hopes of being able to influence the young king. Henriette Louise, however, did not want to marry at all, saying that she instead wanted to become a nun like her cousin Louise Adélaïde d'Orléans. She was one of the final four seriously considered candidates when the original list of 99 princesses was first reduced to seventeen and then to four, leaving her and her sister alongside Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange and Princess Amelia of Great Britain as the final alternatives - and when the two British princesses were removed from the list because of religious issues, she and her sister became the only two remaining candidates. Her brother, the Prime minister, finally recommended her before her sister, because he considered Henriette-Louise to be more attractive than Alexandrine.Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 He described her as a beauty, and pointed out that her wish to become a nun was a testament of her virtue and pious nature; her age made it likely that she would be able to secure the succession by bearing children immediately, and her French nationally had the advantage that one did not have to trust a potentially less truthful foreign assurance about her looks and character.Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 The Prime minister finally stated that her rank was sufficient, as she was as much as descendant of Louis XIV as was the Duke of Orléans, who stood in line to the throne.Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 When the British princesses were ultimately removed from the list, Henriette-Louise was considered to be the final and natural choice, and she was given support of most members of the Royal Council. However, André-Hercule de Fleury was strongly against the match and advised the young king against it. Further more, according to an unverified but well known legend, Madame de Prie visited Henriette Louise in order to estimate if she could indeed function as the intended ally of herself and the duke at court, but when Henriette Louise reacted by cursing her as an 'ungodly creature' and the reason to why her brother was hated by all of France for his sin, Madame de Prie retracted her support.Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 The financiers of the duke and Madame de Prie, the firm of the Paris Brothers Joseph Paris Duverney, also had a bad impression of Henriette-Louise as they feared she was too governed by her mother, who could potentially influence her. Because of that, Henriette-Louise was no longer considered a useful ally as queen by her brother.Edmond et Jules de Goncourt: La duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs, Paris, 1906 In the end, Henriette-Louise was also refused and Marie Leszczyńska, one of the candidates removed when the list was reduced to 17, was chosen instead. Nun On 14 January 1727, Henriette Louise took the veil at the Abbey of Beaumont-lès-Tours. She became the abbess of the convent in 1733 at the age of thirty. While abbess, she was known as Her Serene Highness, Madame de Bourbon. Beaumont-lès-Tours had previously been under the control of her second cousin, Gabrielle, daughter of Louis Victor de Rochechouart de Mortemart, who was the older brother of Madame de Montespan. As an abbess, Henriette Louise raised her great-niece, Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon (1757–1824). The young girl had lost her mother, Charlotte de Rohan, at the age of two. Louise Adélaïde later took the veil herself and became the abbess of Remiremont Abbey. Henriette Louise died at the Abbey of Beaumont- lès-Tours in 1772, having outlived all her siblings except for the Princess of Conti, and was buried there on 8 January.

It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $10 million on a $2 million budget. A sequel entitled Malevolence 3: Killer was released in 2018. Plot Martin Bristol, a young boy with congenital analgesia, is kidnapped by psychotic serial killer Graham Sutter. At an abandoned slaughterhouse once operated by his family, Graham cuts Martin's cheek before butchering a captive young woman in front of him. Martin attempts to escape, but Graham catches him and returns him to the slaughterhouse, where he continues to hold the boy and future female victims captive. Over the next five years, Graham brutally butchers several young women, forcing Martin to watch as the trauma slowly desensitizes him. Graham, who feels guilt over killing the cattle he cared for at the slaughterhouse, talks and argues with the skull of a bull hung on the wall, apparently seeing it and several others like it around the property as some kind of deity. It is strongly implied that Graham was abused by his father and eventually murdered him, keeping his corpse concealed under a sheet in the attic. After the death of her parents, young Allison Miller comes to live with her paternal uncle Jonathan, her aunt Karen, and her cousin Wendy in Minnersville, the same town where Graham commits his crimes. While out for a run, she sees Martin from the window of the supposedly abandoned slaughterhouse next to Graham's farmhouse. When she is almost hit by a truck, she meets a local boy, William, with whom she forms a relationship of sorts. One night, Jonathan intervenes as Allison and William are about to have sex. The next day, Allison goes to the farmhouse after again seeing Martin in the slaughterhouse window and is captured by Graham. When she doesn't return home, Jonathan drives to the farmhouse, looking for her, but Graham shoots him dead. William, also searching for Allison, sees Jonathan's abandoned car and finds Allison locked inside a cold meat room when he investigates. William attempts to save her, but is killed by Graham. Graham has become fearful of Martin because of his inability to feel pain and pins his hand to the kitchen table with a knife to prevent him from leaving the slaughterhouse. Allison escapes by pushing a metal rod through a hole in the door and lifting the lock mechanism. She finds Martin with his hand still pinned on the kitchen table and removes the knife before carrying him out of the farmhouse. Graham takes Jonathan's body to his home, and attacks Karen, who tells Wendy to run. Wendy runs upstairs and hides in her closet, tearfully listening to her mother die. Allison arrives at the house, just as Graham has set it on fire. Graham finds Wendy and decides to use her to replace Martin as his assistant, but Allison interrupts and stabs Graham, causing him to flee. Allison attempts to call 911, but Martin stabs her to death, his mind now completely twisted by years of Graham's abuse. He then kills Wendy before leaving the burning house. Martin returns to the farmhouse and attacks the injured Graham with an axe. Graham thanks Martin before being hacked to death. The next morning, the authorities arrive at the smoldering ruins of the Miller house and rule it an accident. Martin begins to construct a new skeletal shrine in the farmhouse, with the bull's skull as the head. He then stares out the window, waiting for his next victim. In a post-credit scene set five years later, a girl named Courtney Harrison flees from an unseen pursuer. She enters the farmhouse and discovers Martin, who is now older, sitting at a table. When she asks for help, Martin slowly turns around, as the film ends.

Production During post- production, director Stevan Mena's initial cut of the film was three hours long. Things cut from the film included overtly gory scenes. The film is a prequel to Malevolence, stating \\"The only way to describe it is like an epic horror story. It's more in the vein of The Shining, whereas the original was kind of like Halloween or Friday the 13th. Bereavement is more of a character study\\". Release The film was shown at the Long Island International Film Expo on July 16, 2010. The film was released in theaters by Anchor Bay Entertainment on March 4, 2011. A director's cut of the film, retitled Malevolence 2: Bereavement, was released to home media by Mena Films on October 12, 2018. Reception Bereavement has received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 44% \\"rotten\\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 4.85/10 based on 18 reviews. Dread Central's Steve Barton gave the film a 3 out of 5 stars and said, \\"Fans of Malevolence will most likely eat this one up because it truly plays like one person's nightmarish descent into a world of total madness. It gives you a feel for who Martin Bristol is and why he's so lethal. On that level, the film is a complete success. We just wish there was an equally as successful editor to go along with it.\\" Conversely, Paul Brunick of The New York Times criticized the film's emphasis on violence, commenting that \\"The excruciating acts of violence are somewhat offset by Mr. Mena's pictorial grace notes: the rustling landscapes of amber wheat, the detailed Americana of rural homesteads. But frankly, I'd sooner touch a nine-volt battery to my tongue than sit through this film again.\\" References External links   * Category:2010 horror films Category:2010s slasher films Category:2010s crime films Category:American crime films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in 1989 Category:Films set in 1994 Category:Films set in 1999 Category:Films set in abandoned houses Category:American serial killer films Category:American slasher films Category:Prequel films Category:2010 films Category:Backwoods slasher films ","title":"Bereavement (film)"},{"id":"24707032","title":"Futsal at the 2009 Asian Indoor Games"},{"id":"24707048","text":"Robert Cottingham (born 1935 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American artist known for his paintings and prints of urban American landscapes depicting building facades, neon signs, movie marquees, railroad heralds and shop fronts.Robert Cottingham (b. 1935, Brooklyn, New York) at the Guggenheim New York Although often considered one of the most important photorealist painters, Cottingham rejects the label of being a photorealist.

The Alliance began in 1991 and was incorporated in 1993. It brings together a number of disparate organisations for the common purpose of improving the health of people who live and work in Australia's non-metropolitan areas.  Member bodies  the Alliance comprises 44 member bodies, each of which is a national organisation. They represent health consumers, health care professionals, service providers, health educators, students and some Indigenous health organisations.

The Alliance's work has remained independent of government and is controlled and managed by its member bodies, through its Council. Current members of Council at any given time are listed on the Alliance's website. The Alliance's interests and constituency are the communities of rural and remote Australia. Rural and remote areas are defined (arbitrarily) by the Alliance as all those places except the nine capital cities and the regional conurbations of Townsville, the Gold Coast, Newcastle, the Central Coast, Wollongong and Geelong. Australia has various formal classification systems of the geographic continuum from 'metropolitan' to 'remote', the latest and most widely used of which is the Australian Standard Geographic Classification System – Remoteness Areas (ASGC-RA). Despite Australia's general affluence, for a number of reasons the health status of its people deteriorates with increasing remoteness (i.e. distance from its capital cities). The proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in local communities increases with remoteness and this contributes to the urban-remote health gradient. Across Australia as a whole there is a 12-17 year difference in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Between remote and metropolitan areas the difference is estimated to be 3–4 years. Against this background, the Alliance’s vision is good health and wellbeing in rural and remote Australia. The Alliance takes a broad view of health and a long-term view of the development of rural Australia. Its operation is based on the view that all Australians, wherever they live, should have access to comprehensive, high quality health services and the opportunity for equivalent health outcomes. This aspiration requires action relating to the social and economic determinants of health, as well as to factors in the health sector more narrowly defined. These broader issues include education, housing, employment, rural and regional development, telecommunications, transport, cultural safety, illness prevention, health promotion, and health infrastructure. The Alliance works with consumers, communities and governments to make the diverse communities of rural and remote Australia healthy and health-promoting places in which to live and work. In 1998-99 the NRHA was a participant with Commonwealth, State and Territory governments in development of a national strategic framework for rural and remote health in Australia: Healthy Horizons. It worked with governments on the updated Healthy Horizons 2003-07 and on its review in 2008. The NRHA is manager of the biennial National Rural Health Conference. The Conference has become a key event on the calendar of people interested in improving health in rural, regional and remote Australia, whether as community representatives, policy makers, researchers or other stakeholders. The NRHA is the national manager for the Australian Government of the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme (RAMUS). The RAMUS scheme is part of the national strategy to increase the medical workforce available to people in rural Australia. RAMUS supports around 580 rural students each year to study medicine. The Alliance also managed Stream 2 of the Rural Health Continuing Education program (RHCE2) on behalf of the Department of Health.[2] RHCE2 was designed to foster inter-professional, team-based training and joint continuing development projects in order to better enable practising health professionals to provide health care services, both as members of multi-disciplinary teams and as individual practitioners. The program is also designed to support the retention of rural and remote health professionals.http://rhce.ruralhealth.org.au/ The Alliance is owner and manager of the Australian Journal of Rural Health (AJRH) Partyline is the Alliance’s flagship magazine.

He earned his B.F.A. and his M.F.A. from the University of Iowa in 1949 and 1950 respectively. Kacere painted his first photorealist painting in 1969 involving the midsection of a woman dressed in lingerie. It was over three times life size. In 1978 one of his paintings was used as the cover of the first Jorge Santana's album (Jorge Santana is the younger brother of famous Carlos Santana).Meisel, Louis K.

It existed from 1957 to 1961. Origins The DAC was formed in response to the British H-Bomb tests carried out between 1956 and 1958. In 1957, at the time of one of the tests on Christmas Island, Harold Steele planned to sail into the test area in protest. He was unable to do soLSE Archives but his supporters formed a committee and marched in support to the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. The original committee comprised: *J. Allen Skinner *Hugh Brock and *Arlo Tatum.Arlo Tatum is by origin American. He was the national co-ordinator of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors and produced the Handbook for Conscientious Objectors (1952) and Guide to the draft (1969). They were soon joined by: *Michael Randle (who became Chair) *April Carter (Secretary) *Pat Arrowsmith (Field Secretary) *Michael Scott and *Will Warren. By the end of 1958 the Committee's members also included Alex Comfort, Frances Edwards, Sheila Jones, Francis Jude and Michael Howard (of the Crusade for World Government) Christopher Driver, The Disarmers: A Study in Protest, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1964 who later served as adjutant to Bertrand Russell during his dispute with Canon John Collins over the legitimacy of direct action. Actions The DAC's march from London to Aldermaston at Easter, 1958, for which DAC Committee member Michael Howard was the Chief Marshall was, in the event, supported by the newly formed Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and in the upsurge of popular opposition to the H-bomb attracted thousands of people. The Aldermaston March was subsequently run as an annual event by CND. The DAC organised meetings, marches, vigils and pickets, campaigned in parliamentary elections and carried out acts of civil disobedience to publicise the pacifist cause. Following the principles of the Indian nationalist leader M.K.Gandhi, they believed their actions should be non-violent and carried out at some personal cost to themselves, such as losing their jobs or going to jail. What differentiated them from other peace organisations at the time was their attempt to persuade people to stop working in industries connected with nuclear weapons, in which they had some successes. After the 1958 Aldermaston march, the DAC stayed in the Aldermaston area to try to stop work at the Atomic Weapons Establishment. They picketed, met with trades unions, held factory gate meetings and canvassed in the surrounding villages. As a result, five workers resigned from their jobs, three job applicants withdrew and five drivers refused to deliver to the establishment.Allen Lovell, \\"Where Next for the Campaign?\\" Universities and Left Review, No.6, Spring 1959\\"Pat Arrowsmith recalls organising against Britain's Bomb\\", Socialist Worker, 22 March 2008 The DAC then moved to Norfolk to campaign against the Thor nuclear missiles at an RAF base at North Pickenham, using similar methods to those they had used at Aldermaston. One worker left the base and others said they would do so if they could find other jobs. They then moved to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, to campaign against the de Havilland and English Electric factories, which made guided missiles. The DAC ran a \\"No votes for the H-bomb\\" campaign in the 1959 South West Norfolk by- election. They worked with similar organisations outside the UK, demonstrating against nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert and in a peace march from San Francisco to Moscow, organised by the Committee for Non-Violent Action in 1961. Their final action before being wound up was a demonstration against the Polaris nuclear submarine in spring, 1961.

Most of its members were active in the Committee of 100. Assessment As long as it lasted, the DAC was effectively the direct-action wing of CND, whose leadership were either uncertain about direct action or opposed to it. There was an overlap between supporters of CND and supporters of the DAC. The sponsors of the DAC included the president of CND (Bertrand Russell), three members of CND's executive committee and other CND leaders. Pat Arrowsmith, a pacifist and consistent supporter of direct action, was appointed assistant secretary of CND after the first Aldermaston March. The DAC depended on the support of many local CND groups and was also given money by the CND executive committee. However, there were differences in age, background and political experience between the members of DAC and the CND leadership, and there were considerable differences in tactics and ideology. Christopher Driver in his book on the early years of CND says of the DAC, \\"For the most part the members of the DAC were people of exceptionally pure motives. ... Unlike the CND Executive, and unlike some of their successors in the Committee of 100 into which the DAC was eventually merged, many DAC members were not particularity interested in the local and national publicity which their actions evoked, except insofar as it helped to make converts to Gandhi's ideas on non-violent action.\\" See also *List of anti-war organisations *List of peace activists References Category:Peace organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Anti-nuclear organizations Category:Direct action ","title":"Direct Action Committee"},{"id":"24707312","text":"Saša Kolunija (, born June 9, 1987) is a Bosnian Serb professional football player.

Oct 15, 2009. won the Shamus Award for Best Original Paperback Crime Fiction Novel of 2009.http://murdermysterymayhem.blogspot.com/2010/10/shamus-award- winners-2010.html Biography Ira Berkowitz’s path to writing fiction took thirty years to complete. Growing up in Brooklyn, Berkowitz dreamed of a career in medicine or law. But advertising beckoned. When he retired, he began to write. His first attempt at a novel garnered fifty rejections. A few were encouraging. So, he kept at it. Berkowitz’s novels explore the themes of family, loyalty, and asymmetrical justice – an all too familiar condition where the cards are stacked against the weak. His novels are set in Hell's Kitchen, a gentrifying neighborhood with a bloody, sordid past. It is as much a major character in the series as Jackson Steeg, an alcoholic ex-NYPD Homicide Detective. Although he mourns the changes in the neighborhood he loves, Steeg knows a simple truth: No matter how much sheen and glitz is slathered on Hell’s Kitchen, crime will always thrive in its cracks and crevasses. Berkowitz lives with his wife in Westchester County, New York. Novels *2006 Family MattersBerkowitz, Ira. \\"Ira Berkowtiz.\\" Ira Berkowitz. Random House, Web.

Kleemann has been recognized as one of the original artists of the Photorealism movement.Meisel, Louis K. Photorealism, Harry N. Abrams, New York, NY, 1980. His work is usually that of shiny, brightly painted vehicles sometimes focusing on just certain parts. Ron Kleemann Biography  Biography  Kleemann began to use photographs as aides for his paintings in 1968.Meisel, Louis K. Photorealism, Harry N. Abrams, New York, NY, 1980. Pg. 303. These early paintings had subjects such as trucks and cars. Some of the paintings were superimposed with parts of the male and female body.

After returning from summer vacation, his teacher told Chris' class to write a story about what they did during their vacation. Chris had spent the summer being treated for his illness, and asked his teacher if he could write something else, to which she agreed. He wrote about adventures and struggle of an aspiring knight, also named Millard, to conquer Raptenahad (a play on \\"rhabdomyosarcoma,\\" the cancer Chris had), a magic-wielding evil queen who symbolized his illness. To defeat her, the story's Millard has to complete four difficult tasks.Scott Moore, Sir Millard's Quest, The Washington Post, August 6, 1995John Latimer, From cancer to dancer -- Allison Engle dances in Penn State marathon, LDNews, 02/22/2011 The story gave its name to the Four Diamonds Fund, a childhood cancer-centered charitable organization established in 1972 by Chris' parents Charles and Irma. The story was also turned into a Disney TV movie in 1995. Story The story relates the quest of teenage squire Millard to prove his knighthood for King Arthur preliminary to questing for the Holy Grail. Millard decides to do this by ridding a distant land of the evil sorceress Raptenahad and liberate it of her many curses. Once captured by Raptenahad, the young hero attempts repeatedly to regain his freedom and vanquish her. The witch begins to admire her captive for his courage, and offers Millard to try and collect the Diamonus Quadrus (the Four Diamonds) of Courage, Wisdom, Honesty and Strength in order to defeat her (these were virtues Chris believed were necessary in the battle against cancer). If Millard accomplished every difficult task she assigned him, he would be freed and her reign would end forever. Eventually, his continued success enrages Raptenahad and, fearing for her life, she determines to destroy him on his final challenge, however he manages to overcome all obstacles and completes it too. With the sorceress being no more, and her curses lifted, the knight takes over her former castle as his own palace and the story of Sir Millard begins.Penn State Hershey Four Diamonds Fund - Chris' StoryDebra N.

Health Claims are regulated under the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations. The Section 5(1) of the Food and Drugs Act requires that all health claims be truthful and not misleading or deceptive. The regulatory requirements permitting the use of claims vary significantly depending on the nature and type of the claim. Some claims may be made without pre-market approval provided they are truthful and not misleading or deceptive, whereas other claims, such as disease risk reduction or therapeutic claims are only allowed once a regulatory amendment specifying the conditions for their use has been completed Health Canada (2009). \\"Food and Nutrition: Questions and Answers on Health Claims\\" URL: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/qa-qr_claims- allegations-eng.php Manufacturers are responsible for the accuracy of all information on the labels and advertisements for food and for compliance with all relevant food legislation and policies, including those pertaining to health claims. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is responsible for ensuring that industry complies with these requirements There are several types of claims that can be made on food products Food claims express the composition, quality, quantity or origin of a food product. Examples of Food Claims are \\"made in Canada\\" \\"Home-style Chilli\\" and \\"Fresh Pasta.\\" Nutrition (nutrient content) claims characterizes the energy value of the food or the amount of a nutrient contained in a food. It provides a quick and easy way to identify foods with specific nutritional features of interest. Examples of nutrition claims are \\"low in sodium\\" sodium free\\" and \\"100 Calories per serving.\\" Health claims is any representation in labeling or advertising that states, suggests, or implies that a relationship exists between consumption of a food or an ingredient in the food and a person's health. There are two categories of health claims: General Health Claims and Specific Health Claims. General health Claims: These claims are broad general claims that promote health through healthy eating or that provide dietary guidance. These claims do not refer to a specific or general health effect, disease, or health condition. Example: The claim \\"Include low fat product \\"x\\" as part of healthy eating\\" \\"healthy for you\\" or \\"healthy choice\\" Specific health claims Disease risk reduction and therapeutic claims: Since 2003, Health Canada has allowed certain disease risk reduction claims to be used on food labels or in advertisements. These claims are used to describe the link between the characteristics of a diet, a food or food constituent and the risk reduction of a disease or the therapeutic effect of a food or food constituent or diet, (including restoring, correcting, or modifying body functions). Example: The claim \\"(naming the diet characteristics, food or food constituent) reduces the risk of heart disease\\" or \\"lowers blood cholesterol\\" can be used when the food carrying the claim meets conditions for use set out in the food regulations.# ^ Health Canada (2009). \\"Food and Nutrition: Questions and Answers on Health Claims\\" URL: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/qa- qr_claims-allegations-eng.php Function claims: These claims are used to describe the specific physiological effects of foods and food constituents associated with health or performance. Example: The claim \\"(naming the food or food constituent) promotes regularity or laxation\\" can be used for coarse wheat bran providing a minimum of 7 grams of dietary fibre in a reasonable daily intake of the food. Nutrient function claims (formerly known as biological role claims), are a type of function claim that describe the well- established functions of nutrients or energy necessary for the maintenance of good health, normal growth and development Example: The claim \\"Calcium aids in the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth\\" may be used for foods providing a minimum of 5% of the Recommended Daily Intake of the nutrient per serving of stated size and reference amount of the food.  Health claim #1  \\"A healthy diet low in sodium and high in potassium can reduce the risk of high blood pressure\\" Measurements of dietary sodium Dietary sodium can be measured in two ways. Total dietary sodium measures the amount (in grams or milligrams) of sodium in the food. Sodium ratio refers to the amount of sodium per amount of food eaten, usually in grams per kilocalorie, or milligrams per kilocalorie. Dietary potassium can be measured as the total amount of potassium in the diet (usually in milligrams). It can also be measured in relation to sodium intake as the potassium-sodium ratio, in mg K/mg Na, or mg K/g Na. Only this last measurement shows the effect of dietary potassium as part of the equation; the rest measure only sodium intake, which is less important overall than the combined effects of potassium and sodium. DASH diet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a dietary intervention designed to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension. It emphasizes fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, poultry, nuts and fish, and limits red meats, sweets and sweetened drinks. It has been found to reduce hypertension in patients even without weight loss or reduction of sodium intake. However, it is usually used in combination with a sodium-controlled diet. Research supporting the claim Most research has shown that reducing sodium intake reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and all-cause mortality rate. A study by Langford in 1983 observed that populations that consume less sodium also tend to have relatively high potassium intake, and a lower rate of CVD. Within the USA, he also noticed racial and class differences in CVD, which he suggests may be due to sodium being cheaper to acquire in the diet than potassium, since many products contain added salt. Reddy and Katan recommend a salt intake below 5 g/day (5000 mg/day), and to increase potassium intake by 2 - 3 g/day. The study emphasizes that this should be done through dietary changes, rather than by taking a dietary supplement containing potassium. He et al. observed in 1999 that increased salt consumption had a direct relationship to increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in overweight people. Cook et al. observed patients 10–15 years after they had received treatments for prehypertension. They found that reducing sodium intake by 1.2 g/day reduced the number of people needing anti-hypertension treatment by 50%. Subjects who had no hypertension when they began the study 10 – 15 years earlier were also 50% less likely to require treatment for hypertension. Their results suggest that increased sodium intake can cause CVD independently of hypertension - that is, even if the patient continues to have normal blood pressure. High sodium intake is associated with increased vascular reactivity and growth, and myocardial fibrosis, which is associated with myocardial disarray. They also noticed a direct relationship between sodium intake and ventricular hypertrophy, an increase in the mass of the left ventricle of the heart. In lay terms, this means an enlargement of the heart chamber that pumps blood to body tissues, including the cardiac muscle itself. In order to reduce blood pressure, and prevent hypertension and CVD, Cook et al. recommend reducing sodium intake by 25 - 30% from current levels. Increasing dietary potassium intake has been shown to have a significant effect on blood pressure in populations with high sodium intake. It is not apparent from the study performed by Khaw et al. whether there is a difference for populations consuming low amounts of sodium; however, this is not particularly relevant in Canada, where people are more likely to consume excess sodium. Dietary sources of sodium In 2007, Joffres et al. reported that in the typical Canadian diet, 11% of sodium occurs naturally, 12% is added during cooking and at the table, and 77% is added by industry during processing. Their study was to determine whether regulations to limit the amount of salt added by food manufacturers could reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 30%, which would substantially reduce Canadian health care costs. Research not supporting the claim Some Studies do not recommend that the general healthy population should reduce their sodium intake because they feel that there is no conclusive evidence that this will guarantee a lower incidence of hypertension. A major study with this recommendation is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I). They did observe that people with a lower-sodium diet had a lower all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) -related mortality rate. However, because they could not be certain that reducing sodium intake could reduce hypertension and CVD, and it was not just one factor in the lifestyles of people who naturally ate a lower-sodium diet, they did not feel a need to recommend that the general population should reduce sodium intake. The Developers of the DASH diet do not recommend reducing dietary sodium, because they found that the overall DASH diet is effective even without reducing sodium intake. That is, an overall healthy diet is more important than only reducing sodium intake, even in regulating hypertension. A 1996 study by Midgley et al. recommends a reduction in sodium intake for older patients with hypertension, but does not support recommendations for the general population to reduce their sodium intake. As mentioned above, sodium intake can have cardiovascular effects without hypertension. It is therefore prudent to reduce sodium intake even if blood pressure is normal. It is important to consume an overall healthy diet that essentially follows the Canada Food Guide. Reducing sodium intake to recommended levels can reduce the risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular problems, and reduction of sodium intake carries no inherent risk. Because most of the sodium we consume is added during processing, preparing healthy meals at home and adding salt during cooking, rather than purchasing ready meals and snacks, is an easy way to reduce sodium intake without compromising the flavour and texture that salt provides in food. Summary Most studies to date have shown that reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake, to levels recommended in Canadian nutritional guidelines such as RDA, can reduce the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Most dietary sodium in Canada is added by food manufacturers during processing, and regulations controlling the amount of salt that can be added by food manufacturers may help reduce the prevalence of these illnesses in Canada.  Health claim #2   \\"A healthy diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\\"  In order to make the health claim \\"A healthy diet adequate in calcium and vitamin D, and regular physical activity, help to achieve strong bones and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis, the food must be: *high or very high in calcium, *may also be very high in Vitamin D, *cannot have more Phosphorus than Calcium, *must be limited in Alcohol, and * must have more than 40 kcal (unless it is a fruit or vegetable.Health Canada,(2009). Nutrition Labelling...Get the Facts! website: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label- etiquet/nutrition/educat/te_background-le_point-08-table2-eng.php Nutrition and bone health The two main calcium centers in the body are found in bones and blood. Homeostatic controls of the body ensure that the blood maintains a constant proportion of Ca++. If there is a decrease in serum calcium levels, the body responds by secreting Parathormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland into the blood which; 1)Increases re-absorption of Ca++ from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract(GI) 2)Releases calcium from bones into the blood Vitamin D also plays a crucial role in maintaining serum calcium levels (Ca++ in the blood). Vitamin D stimulates absorption of calcium from the GI tract through its interaction with receptors in the enterocyte. Vitamin D also increases transcription of genes that code for Calbindin. As the name implies, Calbindin functions as a calcium-binding protein thereby enhancing calcium absorption. As a result of the body scavenging for calcium from bones; the bones may become fragile, brittle and weak, which in prolonged states can lead to osteoporosis and or bone fractures. Conversely, if there is an adequate level of Ca++ in the blood, PTH will be inhibited. Similarly, in the case where there is an excess of Ca++ in the blood, it will be stored in bones as this is the nutritional reserve for Calcium and Phosphorus Bone depends upon dietary intake to supply the bulk materials needed for synthesis of the extracellular material, which composes more than 95% of bone. These bulk materials are mainly calcium, phosphorus and protein. Roughly half the volume of the extracellular material of bone consists of protein and the other half of calcium phosphate crystals. It is self-evident that a growing organism cannot amass this structural material if the bulk components of bone are not present in adequate amounts in the diet. It is for this reason that bone growth is stunted during general malnutrition and specific bone abnormalities develop with deficiencies in protein, ascorbic acid, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, copper and manganese to name only a few Research supporting the claim There is a significant body of evidence which establishes that high calcium intakes augment bone gain during growth, retards age-related bone loss, and reduces osteoporotic fracture risk. A meta-analysis study in 2007 assessed whether calcium supplementation can reduce osteoporotic fractures. The meta-analysis included all the randomized trials in which calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D, was used to prevent fracture and osteoporotic bone loss. In total, 63 897 individuals were analysed, most of whom were women (n=58 785 [92%]) with a mean age of 67.8 years (SD 9.7). In trials that reported fracture as an outcome (17 trials, n=52 625), treatment was associated with a 12% risk reduction in fractures of all types. In trials that reported bone-mineral density as an outcome (23 trials, n=41 419), the treatment was associated with a reduced rate of bone loss of 0.54% (0.35–0.73; p<0.0001) at the hip and 1.19% (0.76–1.61%; p<0.0001) in the spine. The fracture risk reduction was significantly greater (24%) in trials in which the compliance rate was high (p<0.0001). The treatment effect was better with calcium doses of 1200 mg or more than with doses less than 1200 mg (0.80 vs 0.94; p=0.006), and with vitamin D doses of 800 IU or more than with doses less than 800 IU (0·84 vs 0·87; p=0·03). Evidence supports the use of calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D supplementation, in the preventive treatment of osteoporosis in people aged 50 years or older. For best therapeutic effect, minimum doses of 1200 mg of calcium, and 800 IU of vitamin D (for combined calcium plus vitamin D supplementation is recommended. Dietary recommendations Current recommendations for Calcium are: *1,000 mg per day for people aged 19–50 years *1,200 mg per day for people over the age of 51 years. The Upper Tolerable intake is 2.5 g/day Health Canada (2009). Drugs and Health Products: Calcium.

Saturated fatty acids do not contain any carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the fatty acid chain. Trans fatty acids contain carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the trans confirmation. During the past several decades, reduction of fat intake has been one of the main focuses from a dietary perspective. During these decades, fats have been progressively gaining a greater correlation with health complications especially heart disease. Subsequently, the food industry had been taking notice of this, more labels like \\"fat-free\\" or \\"low-fat\\" appeared on food packaging.  Research supporting the claim  80,082 women who were between 34 and 59 years of age having no known stroke, cancer, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes in 1980 were studied regarding dietary fat intake and its correlation with coronary heart disease. They found that with each 5% increase of energy intake from saturated fat with the same energy intake from carbohydrates was associated with a 17% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease. A related study found that the types of fat consumed is much more important than the amount of fat which is consumed with regards to coronary heart disease. Controlled clinical trials have proved that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat was much more effective in lowering serum cholesterol and reducing risk of CHD compared to reducing total fat consumption. When compared to saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids have a much greater ability to turn High-density lipoprotein (HDL) into Low-density lipoprotein (LDL). HDL commonly referred to as a \\"good cholesterol\\" due to its ability to remove cholesterol from clogs in arteries. LDL subsequently is known as a \\"bad cholesterol\\" since high levels of it is usually an indication of heart disease. The loss of HDL and creation of LDL is highly likely to lead to CHD complications.  Beneficial fatty acids  Despite the fact that trans-fatty acids are not saturated, does not correlate to all unsaturated fats lead to CHD. Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated cis-fatty acids which are an essential fatty acid which the body cannot produce. They are found to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease in clinical interventions. They do not change serum lipid concentrations but reduce blood clotting in vessel walls.  Canada's Food Guide recommendations  Canada's Food Guide recommends 30–45 mL consumption of unsaturated fat each day to get the fat you require for the day. This amount includes oil used for cooking, salad dressings, margarine and mayonnaise. Examples of unsaturated vegetable oils they included were: * canola * corn * flaxseed * olive * peanut * soybean * sunflower Canada's Food Guide also recommends limiting the consumption of food and beverages high in saturated and trans fat.  Health claim #4   \\"A healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits may reduce the risk of some types of cancer\\"  Scientific literature shows that consuming a \\"variety\\" of fruits and vegetables is linked with reduction of some cancers. There is insufficient evidence to support any one fruit/vegetable or food constituent with a reduction of cancer occurrence. Fruits and vegetables have a wide range of nutrients and phytochemicals, thus to achieve optimal nutrient levels a variety is recommended. Some types of cancer signifies that not all types of cancers are diet related and thus not all types of cancer can be reduced by a dietary change. The statement \\"may help\\" eliminates consumer confusion that diet is the only factors in reducing risk of some types of cancers. The wording of this disease reduction health claim cannot be modified in any way. However, words, numbers or signs can be added before or after the claim, provided that they do not change the nature of the claim.Health Canada. (2006).

Potatoes were the most consumed vegetable with 44%, followed by carrots, lettuce onions and tomatoes which marked a cumulative 29% of all vegetables consumed. During 2008 fruit consumption in Canada increased to a record high 47.5 kg per person. Fresh fruit consumption remains the same as in previous years; however, processed fruit consumption increased by 7%. Berries such as strawberries, cranberries, blackberries and blueberries have had a substantial consumption increase to 5 kg by Canadians in 2008. Oranges also remain a major part of fruit consumption at 4.9 kg per person.Statistics Canada. (2008). Analysis: food available for consumption in Canada- 2008.

Consumption of a \\"variety\\" of fruits and vegetables is emphasized as well as consumption of whole foods rather than their juices. Also recommended is to have at least one dark green and one orange vegetable per day. Moreover, the Canada Food Guide suggests that Canadians should consume fruits and vegetables with little or no added salt, sugar or fat.Health Canada. (2007). Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide. Retrieved November 25, 2009, from Health Canada: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn- an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/food-guide-aliment/view_eatwell_vue_bienmang- eng.pdf  Research supporting the claim  Scientific studies have found a relationship between some cancers and fruit and vegetable intake and are the basis for making it one of Canada's five Health Claims. Some studies have looked at overall intake of fruits and vegetables and its relationship with certain types of cancer. Other studies have looked at specific nutrients found in certain fruits and vegetables, such as Vitamins, Minerals and antioxidants and their relationship with cancer. A review conducted by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research has concluded that there is a considerable amount of convincing evidence to support the claim suggesting a protective effect of fruits and vegetables against some cancers.WCRF/AICR. (1997). Food, nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective. Washington. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables are found to have a protective effect and reduce the occurrence of breast cancer. An analysis of 12-case control studies has been conducted in Oxford and found that fruits and vegetables have a consistent protective effect against breast cancer. In particular scholars found that Vitamin C intake had the most statistically significant inverse association with breast cancer. The study concludes that if this relationship represents causality then it is estimated that breast cancer might be prevented in 24% of postmenopausal women and 16% of pre-menopausal women. There is an established relationship between cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and esophagus) and fruit and vegetable consumption. An EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study was conducted during 1992-1998 in which 345,904 people were studied using a dietary questionnaire. During 1998 data was collected and an inverse association was found between fruit and vegetable intake and upper aero-digestive tract cancer occurrence. The large study recommends an increase of fruit and vegetable consumption in order to reduce the risk of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract. Some fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants which are also linked with cancer reduction risks. Micronutrient antioxidants (Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, B-carotene, lycopene) neutralize free radicals in the body and thus prevent cell damage and oxidative damage to DNA. The Journal of Internal medicine published a paper in 2007 which reviews 41 studies conducted concerning Vitamin C and Vitamin E and their role in cancer prevention and treatment. Thirty eight studies did show statistically insufficient beneficial effects of Vitamin E and C on cancer patients. Three of the studies show that there are statistically significant beneficial results. Overall, the systemic review of literature does not support the hypothesis that increased intake of Vitamin E and C (in the form of supplements) can help prevent or treat cancer and that more studies need to be done. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute was done on 1300 prostate cancer patients. Overall the risk of prostate cancer was unaffected by receiving dietary supplemental antioxidants. However, the results in smokers show that an increase in Vitamin E and B-carotene are statistically significant and are associated with reduced risk of the disease. Lycopene is a strong antioxidant found in large quantities in tomatoes as well as other red fruits and vegetables. It has recently been a subject of great research concerning many potential beneficial properties in the human body. There has been some research suggesting that it may reduce the risk of some types of cancer including colorectal, lung and cervical cancer. However, a review done by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007 looks at 168 research studies and concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support a relationship of lycopene and a reduction of any cancer. Overall, no single nutrient has been found to reduce the risk of cancer. However, a definite correlation has been found in fruit and vegetable intake and reduced risk of cancer, therefore, consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended. Due to an extensive and conclusive research done in this area, Canada has officially made this a Disease Reduction Health Claim in 1997. However, much more research needs to be done in order to identify which chemicals in fruits and vegetables are responsible for a reduced risk of cancer.  Health claim #5   \\"Non- fermentable carbohydrates in gums and hard candies can reduce dental caries\\"  Product labelling regulations According to Health Canada, the \\"chewing gums, confectionery, or breath freshening products\\" are the only types of products that may contain this health claim. As follows, the following phrases are allowed to be printed on the mentioned product packaging. Allowed phrases:Health Canada (2006). \\"Consultation Document on Generic Health Claims\\" URL: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims- reclam/health_claims-allegations_sante-eng.php#11 * \\"Won't cause cavities\\" * \\"Does not promote tooth decay\\" * \\"Does not promote dental caries\\" * \\"Non- cariogenic\\" * \\"Tooth friendly\\" (this phrase is allowed to be printed with one of the previous phrases) In addition to the product type specificity, the products must contain one or more of these non-cariogenic sweeteners also known as non-fermentable carbohydrates. Allowed sweeteners: * \\"xylitol, sorbitol, sorbitol syrup, mannitol, maltitol, maltitol syrup, isomalt, lactitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, acesulfame K, aspartame, or sucralose\\"  Involvement of bacteria in development of dental caries  The main culprits in creation of dental caries are cariogenic microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans and sugar (see dental caries for detailed explanation of tooth cavity formation).  Research supporting the claim  There are several studies that show the positive effect of non-fermentable carbohydrates such as xylitol and sorbitol, the most commonly used sugar substitutes in gums and candies, on the reduction of dental caries. In one study in Belize done on 1277 school children of the mean age of 10.2 years, which were given gums with the contents of either xylitol, xylitol-sorbitol, sorbitol, or sucrose to chew under teachers' supervision daily. After a dental exam after 16, 28, and 40 months, the results showed the most significant reduction in dental caries by the consumption of the xylitol gum (Relative Risk = 0.27). For the sorbitol gum the RR = 0.74 while the sucrose gum increased the incidence of dental caries (RR = 1.20).Hayes, C. \\"The effect of non-cariogenic sweeteners on the prevention of dental caries: A review of the evidence\\". Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology. Harvard School of Dental Medicine. URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20041031003008/http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8ACB65DC-F8C9-4160-A310-A846B363DD2A/0/Catherine_Hayes.pdf In another study in Belize done on six-year-old children given xylitol or sorbitol pellets to chew, the results showed the Relative Risk to be 0.35 and 0.44 relative. This study shows that although both xylitol and sorbitol are effective in reduction of incidence of dental caries, xylitol is more effective. In yet another study done on school children in Estonia, that were either given xylitol gums or hard candies to chew/eat for three and two years respectively, the results showed overall results in reduction caries rates versus the control group to be 53.5% for gums and 33-59% for candies. Overall, all these studies and more, show that non-fermentable carbohydrates can reduce dental caries, but let's look at one study that didn't get quite the same results.  Research not supporting the claim  This one study in Madagascar done on school children in grades 1 and 4 were given a \\"school- based oral health education program.\\" In addition to that all children had to undergo supervised toothbrushing daily. The group was then split into control group and test group where the test group received two types of gum to chew 3-5 times a day. One type of gum was polyol while the other contained a mix of sorbitol (55.5%), xylitol (4.3%), and carbamide (2.3%). After 3 years of this program, the results of the dental exams showed no significant difference between the test and control groups. It is thought that due to the daily supervised toothbrushing, the groups were similar in their overall oral hygiene and therefore the significant difference between the results was reduced. Claims under consideration # A healthy diet rich in a variety of vegetables, fruit and whole grain products and reduced risk of heart disease; and # A diet rich in folate along with a daily folic acid supplement and reduced risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord A diet rich in folate along with a daily folic acid supplement and reduced risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord For the past decades, lack of folate (vitamin B9) had been linked to risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord (specifically neural tube defect). Neural tube defect is the most common brain and spinal cord related defect in Canada today. In a randomized controlled double-blind trial in South Wales, 44 women who had one child with neural tube defect, took 4 mg. of folic acid a day before and during pregnancy. This resulted in no recurrences amongst these who received supplementation. Concluding that folic acid supplementation might be an effective method of neural tube defect prevention. In another related study, it was stated that folic acid prevents 70 percent of neural tube defects but its mode of action is unclear. Not fully understanding the mechanism of how folate prevents neural tube defects may be a concern that is preventing Canada from allowing it to be a health claim. Also, if this becomes a health claim it will be the first Canadian health claim recommending a natural health product supplement. Thus, more research on this topic is required to insure safety to Canadians.

The current building was completed in 1914, and replaced a prior building that stood on what is now Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. Standing at the height of , it was the first high-rise government building in the United States. At the time it was built, it was also the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. Oakland City Hall in 1917 The building was designed by New York-based architecture firm Palmer & Hornbostel in 1910, after winning a nationwide design competition. The building, constructed in the Beaux-Arts style, resembles a \\"rectangular wedding cake\\". It consists of three tiers. The bottom tier serves the foundation. It is three stories high and houses the mayor's office, the city council chamber, hearing rooms, and a police station with a firing range below in the basement. The thinner second tier follows; it is a ten-story office tower. The top floor of this section (the 12th floor) houses a 36-cell jail with an outdoor yard that has gone unused since the 1960s. Above the second tier is the two-story podium with a clock tower on top. The exterior is built of white granite and terra cotta, while the inside is built of white and black marble. The building was nicknamed \\"Mayor Mott's wedding cake\\" after former Oakland Mayor Frank Kanning Mott, a key player in passing the bond to pay for the new City Hall, who was married the same year construction began. In 1983, the Oakland City Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the building suffered from major structural damage and was immediately closed down. Instead of tearing it down and replacing it with a newer building, city leaders decided to retrofit it seismically. To do so, steel columns in the foundation were cut and they were replaced by rubber bearings. Steel beams were added to support the steel structure and concrete walls were added to support existing walls. The building can now move laterally 18-20 inches in an earthquake. The city hall was repaired along with the downtown revitalization project of building new office buildings. The repair project cost $85 million.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History Ruins of Castle Neuburg Castle Neuburg was first built during the late 13th century or early 14th, most likely for the Baron Tumb von Neuburg from Vorarlberg. It is unclear whether there was an earlier castle or why the Tumb von Neuburg family acquired land in Graubünden. It was first mentioned in 1345 as Nüwburg. In 1360 they had to give the castle to Heinz and Martin Buwix as collateral for a loan, but by 1385 they were back in possession of the castle. In 1396 Frik Tumb quarreled with Ulrich Brun von Rhäzüns, which led to a feud between the two families and Neuburg Castle being besieged. In 1400 Johann von Neuburg became a vassal to the Bishop of Chur to protect his claim to the castle. About 1450 it came under the control of Rudolf von Rappenstein or von Mötteli. In 1496 it was sold to the Bishop of Chur, who appointed a bailiff to administer the estates. In the following years, the castle was expanded, but during the 16th century it was abandoned and fell into ruin. Then, in 1577 the municipality bought the castle and associated barony. In the 16th Century, the site was abandoned and began to collapse. Castle site The castle site includes the still visible rectangular keep, which is one of the largest in Raetia. The keep was four stories tall and was about in size. The original high entrance was located on the west, about above ground level. The tower was divided into three parts by large interior walls. North and west of the keep, the foundations and portions of the curtain wall and gatehouse are still visible. In the northern courtyard, there is a large round cistern.

The three manuscripts that comprise the only extant copies of the Chronicle are among the Dunhuang Manuscripts found in the early 20th century in the so-called \\"hidden library\\" at the Mogao Grottoes near Dunhuang, which is believed to have been sealed in the 11th century CE. The Chronicle, together with the Old Tibetan Annals comprise Tibet's earliest extant history.Dotson (2009), p.9.  Discovery  Paul Pelliot examines manuscripts in cave 17 An enormous number of early manuscripts in a variety of languages were collected by Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot at the famous sealed-up Library Cave (no. 17) of the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang and sent back to London and Paris respectively. The Dunhuang manuscripts in the Tibetan language include the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, and the Old Tibetan Annals, which have been described as \\"the first and single most important documents available on early Tibetan history.\\"\\"Foreword\\" by Per Sørensen in (Dotson (2009), p. 1. The Old Tibetan Chronicle is extant in two manuscripts in the Pelliot Collection at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, and some manuscript fragments. The main scroll comprises Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287. The Tibetan text is written on the blank verso sides of panels pasted together from Chinese scrolls. In the first critical edition of Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287, Jacques Bacot and Charles Toussaint considered them to be represent separate texts and referred to Pelliot tibétain 1286 as \\"Principautés anciennes et généalogie des rois,\\" but following the suggestion of Geza Uray, both are now considered to be two parts a single original manuscript and can be referred to together as the Old Tibetan Chronicle.Uray (1968): pp.124–5. In addition, two folios from a single original manuscript, Pelliot tibétain 1144 and IOL Tib J 1375, overlap with narratives found in the Chronicle, though differing in certain details.  Contents  Tale about Drigum Tsenpo The Old Tibetan Chronicle is a composite text of various lists, narratives and bardic songs arranged to form a single account of the reigns of the Tibetan emperors. As the list of the Tibetan emperors found in the narrative ends with U Dumten ('U'i dum brtan), later known as Langdarma, the Chronicle must have been compiled during or soon after the reign of this emperor, that is, in the 840s.Uray (1968): 124-5 Geza Uray has argued that this composition was made in Dunhuang itself rather than Central Tibet.Uray (1968): 135 The Chronicle begins with a series of lists - of marriage alliances, principalities, emperors and ministers. The list of emperors is prefaced by an account of the descent of the first emperor Nyatri Tsenpo (gNya'-khri bTsan-po) from heaven, and ends with an account of the death of Drigum Tsenpo, the first mortal in the line. After this the Chronicle narrates the overthrow of the prince Zingpoje - this narrative is also represented in the fragmentary Version II of the Chronicle. The narrative then continues with an account of the following Tibetan emperors before coming to the reign of Songtsen Gampo (r. c.605–649). This section actually concentrates on the activities of the minister Khyungpo Pungse. The Chronicle then continues with a narrative of the following emperors, before coming to Trisong Detsen (r. 756-c.800), in which his victory over the rival Tibetan king Lig Myi-rhya is celebrated. The Chronicle then returns to the reign of an earlier emperor Tridu Songtsen (676-704), and his victory over a claim to rule Tibetan by the Gar clan. The Chronicle does not offer a comprehensive account of the history of Tibet. This is partly because of the nature of its composition from earlier narratives and songs. It has also been argued by Lajos Ligeti and Geza Uray that the material in the Chronicle represents the interests of specific Tibetan clans, namely the Dba' and Myang clans (Ligeti adds the Mnon and Tshe- spong clans as well).Uray (1968): 136–7 In this it is comparable to another early Tibetan historical text, the Testament of Ba, which represents the interests of the Dba' clan. Contradicting later Tibetan Buddhist histories, neither the Annals nor the Chronicle make any mention of Buddhism in the reign of Songtsen Gampo.\\"Preface to the Asianart.com edition of this article.\\" By Amy Heller, Jan 21, 2007. However, the Chronicle does say that, during the reign of king Trisong Detsen (Khri srong lde brtsan- ruled from 755 to 797 or 804 CE), \\"The incomparable religion of the Buddha had been received and there were viharas (monasteries) in the centre as well as the borderlands of the country.\\"Bacot, Thomas and Toussaint (1940-1946), p. 153. Problems with chronology It has been clear since the Chronicle was first published that there are problems with its chronology. The victory over Lig Myi-rhya is narrated in the section on Trisong Detsen, yet in the victory song and the following narrative the emperor named is Songtsen Gampo, who ruled over a century earlier. Furthermore, the Chronicle ends in the reign of Tridu Songtsen (676-704), which should come between Songtsen Gampo and Trisong Detsen. There are two main theories regarding this anachronism. Ariane Macdonald and Yoshiro Imaeda have argued that the problems with chronology arose because the Chronicle was composed from a variety of different sources.Macdonald and Imaeda (1979) Geza Uray on the other hand has argued that the scroll of Pelliot tibétain 1287 was cut up and rearranged some time after it was originally written, and the chronological problem results from this. He suggests that this later cutting and pasting may have been done specifically in order to associate the conquest of Lig Myi-rhya with the emperor Trisong Detsen, pointing out that the Bonpo historical tradition also makes that association.Uray (1968): 135–6  Footnotes   References  * Bacot, Thomas and Toussaint (1940–1946).

It is the third and final installment, taking place in the Reyvateil-ruled country of Clustania, located in an area known as Sol Cluster, and set around two and half years after the events of Ar tonelico II. Clustania is situated on the third tower in the world of Ar Ciel, which floats above the uninhabitable Sea of Death. Although it is the final game in the series, the series mythos is continued in Gust's Surge Concerto series through the titles, Ciel Nosurge and Ar Nosurge, which takes place within the same universe. The Japanese version became available for retail on January 28, 2010 and it was released in North America on March 15, 2011. It was released in Europe on April 1, 2011. Gameplay Diving During the game, Aoto, the protagonist, can dive into the 'Cosmospheres' of certain Reyvateils to craft Song Magic, which is done by witnessing their internal turmoils and traumas and helping them to find a solution for them. Various personae exist within the Cosmosphere, and the player can choose to have the Reyvateil fight in their clothing. Because the personae who wear these costumes have differing preferences in 'Song Magic', the costume will influence the RAH. system. Diving additionally deepens the bond between the Reyvateil and the protagonist. However, unlike the previous games, the player can only gain Hyumas in the Cosmosphere because the Song Magic used by each Reyvateil and their persona is preset and unmodifiable. Talk Topics The system for conversation is similar to those of the other games in the series, with the difference being only three Talk Topics are now required for entering the next Cosmosphere level, regardless of what number that level is. Each topic is classified by color to indicate how they are found: * Pink colored topics are triggered by progressing through the main storyline * Green colored topics are obtained by having specific items in the inventory or meeting certain conditions * Blue colored topics are found as shining orbs throughout the maps Talk Topics for the rest of the party members now exist, as opposed to the previous games. The updated Talk Topics system now includes talk topics between all members of the party, instead of topics between the party's Reyvateils and the main character. Conversations between party members are triggered after the player talks to certain non-playable characters or after certain events. Battle System The battle system is real-time based, similar to those of the Star Ocean games. Only one Reyvateil can be present in battle. During a battle, the player controls one of three Vanguard (support/attacking) members and is able to switch control to another character at will. The non-player members of the party are controlled by AI. In battle, the player may attack enemies with an equipped weapon (with successive attacks resulting in a shot combo), protect the Reyvateil from enemy attacks by using a Blowback, or use the Song Magic of the Reyvateil. Items may be used to heal party members or damage enemies. Additionally, the player can make the Reyvateil Purge (shed off part of her clothes) in order to increase the power of her Song Magic. To do this, the player has the attack the enemies whenever a red wave makes contact with the red line in the Harmograph located in the lower part of the screen. Doing this will trigger a Beat Up, which represents the heart of the Reyvateil becoming more excited upon seeing the party members fight hard for her. Once enough Beat Ups have been accumulated, a Purge Ready! notification will appear over the Heart Indicator located at the right of the Harmograph. When this happens, the player has to hold one of the shoulder buttons (L1, R1, R2 or L2) and shake the controller. If they did it correctly, the Reyvateil will Purge part of her clothes, the Burst Gauge will increase its charge speed, the Song Magic will level up to its next stage, and the party will gain an additional elemental attack and resistance depending on which button they held for executing the Purge (L1: Fire, L2: Wind, R1: Ice, R2: Lightning). However, if the Purge was performed incorrectly, the Reyvateil will refuse to Purge and the Song Magic will be released with less power than if it was used normally, so the player has to be careful. Initially, Reyvateil Purge may only be used once; however, up to four levels of Purge and a multi- level Purge may be unlocked by advancing through the Cosmosphere of the Reyvateil. At the Reyvateil's fourth-level Purge, she will unleash her Song Magic Flipsphere, requiring the player to attack in sync with the pulsing of the Harmograph line. Depending on player execution, this results in additional or fewer attacks and may include a finishing blow. Finally, some enemies can use powerful attacks that can hit the entire player party but require a charge time. When they are charging the attack, they will be surrounded by a blue barrier while a blue line appears on the Harmograph. During this time, the Burst Gauge is slowed down and Purging is disabled, so the player has to attack the enemy to break the barrier and nullify the attack. If they don't manage to do so before the blue line makes contact with the border of the Harmograph, the enemy will unleash the attack. The Reyvateils are by themselves defenseless, so they must be defended by the player. Therefore, if all three Vanguard characters fall in battle (their HP reaches 0), the game is over, regardless of whether the Reyvateil is alive or not. When an enemy enters the field surrounding the Reyvateil, an alarm will begin sounding as the HP of the Reyvateil begins being drained away while the Burst Gauge begins decreasing. As the Reyvateil can easily die in these conditions, the player can attack the enemy to get it away from her or activate the Blowback skill, which will teleport the player to the Reyvateil's side and execute a blow that will send the enemy to the opposite side of the battlefield. Once used, the Blowback skill must recharge. RAH System The acronym stands for \\"Real- time Active Hymmnetics\\", and it refers to the fact that the music used during battles, with the exception of the one used in some special events, is variable: each playable Reyvateil will begin singing at the start of battle a melody that will change depending on the actions taken by the player. Each Reyvateil has a base melody, but it can be modified by programming Hyumas into them. The Hyumas, aside of modifying the instrumentation, pitch, and rhythm of the melody, also grants bonuses to the party members when they are activated through the Purge System: periodical HP regeneration, resistance to status ailments, increases of attack and defense... such are what the Hyumas can do upon their activation. Setting Ar tonelico Qoga takes place in the region of Sol Cluster of Planet Ar Ciel, the location of the third and final Tower of Ar tonelico, two years after the conclusion of Ar tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica. This is a harsh region, comprising a mountainous formation called the Great Fang and the Third Tower of Ar tonelico, which also receives the name Tower of Harvestasha. The entire region is under the dominion of the Reyvateil-ruled country of Clustania, located in the upper zones of the Tower, and its army periodically goes to the Great Fang to destroy the towns that have grown to much and to take its inhabitants as prisoners. Afterward executing them or subjecting them to a brainwashing process known as Purification, in which its victims lose their own ego and become vegetables. The Great Fang is formed by several small villages and towns, the largest cities being the underground complex known as the Eternus Shaft and the port city of Ciela Gate. However, the villages see constant destruction as described above, while the Eternus Shaft is out of their reach due to its underground location, and Ciela Gate is under the protection of the Archia Corporachy. The Archia Corporarchy is the only human settlement found in the Tower of Harvestasha, located around its middle zone, and it is the only place in which humans can live without fearing the Purification done by the Clustanians, as long as they don't try to ascend the Tower. Plot The players will take on the role of a young steeplejack apprentice called Aoto, who upon getting awakened by a ruckus outside his house, goes to investigate to find out that Clustanian soldiers are attacking an old man and girl that looks like a swordswoman. After managing to drive them away, the swordswoman transforms into a girl called Saki, while the old man, Kiraha, dies from the wounds the Clustanians caused him, leaving Saki's care on Aoto's hands, while also leaving to him a pendant he asks him to take to his son. Aoto tries to head to the airbus terminal in order to run away from his village with Saki before the Clustanians catch them, where he meets a friend of his called Tatsumi. However, soon they are surrounded by the Clustanians, and Saki demonstrates an unusual power: by praying and using the Purge power, she transforms several of the Clustanian soldiers and their machines into cakes, making her fall unconscious, but allowing a very confused Aoto and Tatsumi to make their escape. After they get away from the village, Saki wakes up, unable to remember anything about Kiraha or the events that just took place, so Tatsumi advises Aoto taking her to a Reyvateil doctor he knows at Eternus Shaft. However, neither of them knew that this would make them embark into a journey that would reveal why the Clustanians restricted so much the life of the humans, the shady plans that were being orchestrated at Archia Corporarchy, as well as also making them collaborate with people from the regions of Sol Ciel and Metafalss into an endeavor that would decide if their planet, Ar Ciel, would survive or die the next year.

Music The soundtrack for the game was composed by the Gust Sound Team, though its configuration changed in comparison to the previous games: only Ken Nakagawa remained, as Akira Tsuchiya was busy being the director and main creator of all the aspects of the game, while Daisuke Achiwa was at the time working solo in the score for Atelier Lina. Newcomer Kazuki Yanagawa made his debut in this game, being responsible for several event and dungeon themes, as well as the sole composer of the samples used in the automatic music generation system known as the RAH System. Lifelong series singer Akiko Shikata contributed herself with a music box event piece as well, as also did doujin music composer HIR with a few themes. For the Hymns, three of the singers employed so far in the series made a return: Akiko Shikata, Haruka Shimotsuki and Noriko Mitose, alongside which several new singers joined the team for the game: Kokia, Yoko Ueno, Au (from the Gusya Ningen band), Azumi Inoue, Noriko Fujimoto, Yula Yayoi, Rekka Katakiri and Haruka Togawa. The music of the game was released in three discs: a two-disc original soundtrack alongside the usual Hymmnos Concert Side Red and Side Blue albums. Contrary to tradition, the original soundtrack contained only the opening theme alongside \\"best of\\" mixes of the RAH System samples and the instrumental BGMs, while the Hymmnos Concerts contained most of the Hymns sung in the game. However, a total of four songs, all of which were used during the final battle in the game, were absent from all media releases. The fourth and final song was released as a track in the image album Singing Hill ~Ar=Ciel Ar=Dor~, but the others never received an official release. The musical style for this game runs similar to that of the previous ones, featuring orchestral, rock, electronica, ethnic, industrial, folk and choral styles. Media releases Similarly to its predecessors, it received a large amount of related merchandise in the form of music CDs, as well as gag manga compilations, Drama CDs that told events that took place after the game's true ending, a Hymmnos Musical chronicling happenings between the events of Ar tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica, a player's guide, a setting materials book, and two novels that also served as an epilogue to the entire series. Reception The game has received generally mixed reviews, with a 65% on the aggregator GameRankings and a 60/100 Metacritic score. Famitsu magazine awarded the game a combined score of 28/40. The game sold over 81,000 copies in Japan in its first week and has sold over 120,000 copies in total there. It receives praise in the same areas as its predecessors, particularly the music, strong characters, and engaging storyline, though its characters have also come under criticism due to the focus on the alternate personae of the heroines. The gameplay is its most criticized aspect due to not being an evolution of the battle system used in Ar tonelico II, and instead being what players have come to call a \\"half-baked attempt at a real-time combat system\\", between the few attacks the players can use, the absence of multiple kinds of Song Magic and the lack of variety in enemy models. Its localization hasn't been as severely criticized as Ar tonelico 2's due to the script being more polished in general, although it still has some flaws, such as translating some terms inconsistently, the translators and editors not following their word of correcting all the Hymmnos terms mistakes they had committed previously, and finally, a bug that causes the final level of a Cosmosphere to have desynchronization between the voiceovers and the written text due to having introduced an additional text box when playing through that section with the Japanese voices on.

The station's transmitter is located in the far northeast corner of Casey County, west of Stanford and near Hustonville on Sand Knob Road. Prior to being leased out, and later sold, to EMF, WXKY was a Stanford-based country music station as WRSL-FM, an adjunct to WRSL (1520 AM). History WRSL-FM When WRSL-FM began operating on May 26, 1967, it was the first FM radio station in service between Lexington and Somerset. The establishment of the FM outlet allowed WRSL, a daytime-only radio station, to begin covering high school sporting events that took place after sunset. The launch of WRSL-FM, which began at 95.9 MHz, saw the formation of a simulcast with the AM station, with both stations broadcasting a country format; WRSL-FM would be one of the longest-running FM country outlets in central Kentucky. The station broadcast from WRSL's existing studios on US 27 north of town, with the FM transmitter being placed on the AM tower. WRSL-FM signed on amidst a multi-year shift in ownership of the Lincoln-Garrard Broadcasting Company, which owned the AM and FM outlets. In 1965, before the company had applied for an FM station, W. G. Morgan, on whose own farmland the station facilities sat, sold his share to Calvin C. Smith; Smith became the full owner in 1969 by buying out Lanier Burchette. The Gaskin family ran WRSL-AM-FM from 1976 to 1982, when health reasons forced Jim Gaskin to relinquish operations; owner Cal Smith then split the two stations' programming and operated WRSL-AM-FM until his death at the age of 55 from pancreatic cancer in 1987. His wife, Ruth, ran the station until she retired in 1994 and sold it to their son, John Smith. Smith's time owning WRSL-FM was one of major change for the station. On June 30, 1995, WRSL-FM moved from 95.9 to 96.3 MHz, increased its power to 25,000 watts from 3,000, and activated its new transmitter on Sand Knob Road. The upgrade substantially increased its coverage area in central Kentucky, though no format changes were planned. The Sand Knob Road transmitter site was vandalized that December by two teenagers who stole equipment that formed WRSL-FM's studio-transmitter link. WXKY WRSL-FM became WXKY-FM, branded as \\"Kentucky's Maximum Country\\", on July 23, 2001, in a bid to play up its regional broadcast area. However, the station would not remain country for long. In January 2002, after being initially approached the year before, owner John Smith opted to lease the station to the Educational Media Foundation, which resulted in the Air 1 network being heard in central Kentucky for the first time; Smith noted that he thought his father, Cal, would have appreciated EMF's ministry, and that he hoped the change would further reinforce perceptions of WXKY-FM as a regional, not a Stanford, station. WXKY was sold in 2004 to EMF itself for $800,000, allowing it to operate noncommercially, and thus completely as a satellite. WXKY was off the air for two weeks and thereafter forced to operate for a time with reduced power after sustaining extensive fire damage in 2008.

The club colours are white and red (white jersey with red hoop). History Following Louth's 1957 All Ireland win, a need arose in the area to form a club and meetings took place in 1958 in the town land of Annaghminnon. The club was finally granted affiliation after several failed attempts in 1959. The club's maiden championship was achieved in 1964 after a narrow victory of John Mitchells and the team was managed by Jim Quigley who had previously led Louth's All Ireland campaign seven years previously. Championship success would not follow for another 36 years until 2000, when Rovers beat Tullyallens Glen Emmet’s by 2 points to lift the Christy Bellew JFC cup. Annaghminnon has spent the majority of its footballing life in the junior ranks of Louth football with a brief two-year period in the intermediate grade in 2001 and 2002. For the years 2012-2018 the club regraded to the reserve divisions in order to preserve its existence due to a shortage of players. In 2019, Annaghminnon Rovers regraded to the junior ranks. The club football field, dressing rooms and community hall are situated in Stonetown, near Dundalk in County Louth. Pairc Annachminnon was opened in 1987, the community hall was erected in 1991, and new dressing rooms were constructed in 2008. Pairc Annachminnon is also home to Monaghan GAA club Magheracloone Mitchell's under a unique ground-sharing collaboration. This was agreed between both clubs after Magheracloone lost their playing grounds due to a collapsed gypsum mine underneath.

The β function is used, in particular, in showing that the class of arithmetically definable functions is closed under primitive recursion, and therefore includes all primitive recursive functions. The β function was introduced without the name in the proof of the first of Gödel's incompleteness theorems (Gödel 1931). The β function lemma given below is an essential step of that proof. Gödel gave the β function its name in (Gödel 1934).  Definition  The \\\\beta function takes three natural numbers as arguments. It is defined as :\\\\beta(x_1, x_2, x_3) = rem(x_1, 1 + (x_3 + 1) \\\\cdot x_2) = rem(x_1, (x_3 \\\\cdot x_2 + x_2 + 1) ) where rem(x, y) denotes the remainder after integer division of x by y (Mendelson 1997:186).  Properties  The β function is arithmetically definable in an obvious way, because it uses only arithmetic operations and the remainder function which is arithmetically definable. It is therefore representable in Robinson arithmetic and stronger theories such as Peano arithmetic. By fixing the first two arguments appropriately, one can arrange that the values obtained by varying the final argument from 0 to n run through any specified (n+1)-tuple of natural numbers (the β lemma described in detail below). This allows simulating the quantification over sequences of natural numbers of arbitrary length, which cannot be done directly in the language of arithmetic, by quantification over just two numbers, to be used as the first two arguments of the β function. Concretely, if f is a function defined by primitive recursion on a parameter n, say by f(0) = c and f(n+1) = g(n, f(n)), then to express f(n) = y one would like to say: there exists a sequence a0, a1, …, an such that a0 = c, an = y and for all i < n one has g(i, ai) = ai+1. While that is not possible directly, one can say instead: there exist natural numbers a and b such that β(a,b,0) = c, β(a,b,n) = y and for all i < n one has g(i, β(a,b,i)) = β(a,b,i+1).  The β function lemma  The utility of the β function comes from the following result, which is the purpose of the β function in Gödel's incompleteness proof (Gödel 1931). This result is explained in more detail than in Gödel's proof in (Mendelson 1997:186) and (Smith 2013:113-118). : β function lemma. For any sequence of natural numbers (k0, k1, …, kn), there are natural numbers b and c such that, for every i ≤ n, β(b, c, i) = ki. The proof of the β function lemma makes use of the Chinese remainder theorem.

(fl. mid-1st century BC) was a Helvian Celt who served as an interpreter and envoy for Julius Caesar in the first year of the Gallic Wars. Troucillus was a second-generation Roman citizen, and is one of the few ethnic Celts who can be identified both as a citizen and by affiliation with a Celtic polity. His father, Caburus, and a brother are named in Book 7 of Caesar's Bellum Gallicum as defenders of Helvian territory against a force sent by Vercingetorix in 52 BC. Troucillus plays a role in two episodes from the first book of Caesar's war commentaries (58 BC), as an interpreter for the druid Diviciacus and as an envoy to the Suebian king Ariovistus, who accuses him of spying and has him thrown in chains. Troucillus was an exact contemporary of two other notable Transalpine Gauls: the Vocontian father of the historian Pompeius Trogus, who was a high-level administrator on Caesar's staff; and Varro Atacinus, the earliest Transalpiner to acquire a literary reputation in Rome as a Latin poet. Their ability as well-educated men to rise in Roman society is evidence of early Gallo-Roman acculturation.Ronald Syme, \\"The Origin of Cornelius Gallus,\\" Classical Quarterly 32 (1938) 39–44, especially p. 41. Syme's article, which is not the last word on the subject (see Cornelius Gallus), considers whether Gallus himself might be the best example of the cultured Narbonese Gaul: \\"If the foregoing argument is correct,\\" he concludes, \\"Gallus was not of colonia Roman or of freedman stock, but, like Caesar's friends Trogus and Procillus (= Troucillus), the son of a local dynast of Gallia Narbonensis\\" (p. 43). Two names, one man? Caesar first mentions Valerius Troucillus in Bellum Gallicum 1.19, when the Roman commander is made aware of questionable loyalties among the Celtic Aedui, Rome's allies in central Gaul since at least the 120s BC. Caesar represents this divided allegiance in the persons of two brothers, the druid Diviciacus, who had appeared before the Roman senate a few years earlier to request aid against Germanic invaders, and the enterprising populist Dumnorix, who was the leading Aeduan in terms of wealth and military power.Jonathan Barlow, “Noble Gauls and Their Other in Caesar’s Propaganda,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter: The War Commentaries as Political Instruments, edited by Kathryn Welch and Anton Powell (Classical Press of Wales, 1998), pp. 139–170; Serge Lewuillon, \\"Histoire, société et lutte des classes en Gaule: Une féodalité à la fin de la république et au début de l'empire,\\" Aufstieg under Niedergang der römische Welt (1975) 425–485. Dumnorix stood accused of conspiring with the enemy Helvetii; when Caesar holds a confidential discussion with his friend Diviciacus, he dismisses the usual interpretersCotidianis interpretibus remotis. and calls in Troucillus. Caesar describes Troucillus as a leading citizen of the province of Gallia Narbonensis and his personal friend (familiaris),The word amicus can mean a political friend or a socially useful friend, but familiaris implies intimacy. adding that he placed the highest trust (fides) in the Helvian in all matters.Cui summam omnium rerum fidem habebat. Latin fides represents a complex of meanings rendered variously in English as \\"trust,\\" \\"confidence,\\" \\"trustworthiness,\\" \\"credibility,\\" \\"fidelity,\\" and \\"loyalty.\\" At Bellum Gallicum 1.46 and 52, Caesar names a Transalpine Gaul, this time according to the manuscripts as Gaius Valerius Procillus, whom he again calls his familiaris as well as his hospes. The hospes, sometimes translatable as a \\"family friend\\" and meaning \\"guest\\" or \\"host\\" in Latin interchangeably, is a participant in the mutual social relationship of hospitium, reciprocal guest-host hospitality. Caesar's use of the term may imply that he was a guest of the Helvian Valerii when he traveled through the Narbonensis, as he did to or from one of his two postings in Hispania during the 60s, or that the Helvian had been a guest of Caesar in Rome before the war.Christian Goudineau, César et la Gaule (Paris: Errance, 1990), p. 74. Most scholarsT. Rice Holmes reviews the 19th-century scholarship in his classic work Caesar's Conquest of Gaul (London, 1903), p. 170 online. Holmes holds with the single-man identification, as do Ramsey MacMullen (who also cites a two-men argument), Romanization in the Time of Augustus, pp. 166–167, note 48, limited preview online, though he calls this man \\"Procillus\\"; and John C. Rolfe, \\"Did Liscus Speak Latin? Notes on Caesar B.G. i. 18. 4–6 and on the Use of Interpreters,\\" Classical Journal 7 (1911), p. 128 online; and Ronald Syme (discussed passim in this article). See also C.-J. Guyonvarc'h, “La langue gauloise dans le De bello gallico,” Revue du CRBC 6: La Bretagne linguistique (1990), discussed at L'Arbre Celtique, \\"Les personnages Celtes,\\" Troucillus/Procillus. assume that the two names refer to a single man; although Troucillus is a problematic reading of the text, it is a well-established Celtic name,D. Ellis Evans, Gaulish Personal Names (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), p. 380; Xavier Delamarre, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (Éditions Errance, 2003), p. 303, giving a derivation from trougo-, trouget-, \\"sad, unhappy, miserable.\\" The name Troucillus also appears in inscriptions. whereas Procillus appears to have been confused with a Roman name.In discussing the importation of the Roman system of three names into Gaul, the 19th-century Celticist Arbois de Jubainville accepted the name Procillus as correct and derives it from Latin procus, like the gentilic Procilius; see Recherches sur l'origine de la propriété foncière et des noms de lieux habités en France (Paris, 1890), p. 131 online. Procillus is also one of the names in the epigrams of Martial (Epigrams, book 1, poems 27 and 115), who was a Celtiberian. In this episode, Caesar sends Troucillus as a diplomatic envoy to the Suebian king Ariovistus,A mission referred to also by Appian, Celtic Wars 17, where Troucillus is not identified by name. and again commends his linguistic skills and his fides, his loyalty or trustworthiness. Caesar identifies Troucillus as an adulescens, a young man, generally in Caesarian usage between the ages of 20 and 30 and not having yet entered the political career track or held a formal command. The term is used elsewhere in the Bellum Gallicum for Publius CrassusBellum Gallicum 1.51.7; 3.7.2 and 21.1. and Decimus Brutus,Bellum Gallicum 3.11.5; 7.9.1 and 87.1. who were born in the mid-80s.Guyonvarc'h, \\"La langue gauloise dans le De Bello Gallico\\"; Elizabeth Rawson, “Crassorum funera,” Latomus 41 (1982), p. 545 on the meaning of adulescens. See further discussion at Publius Licinius Crassus: Early military career. Vercingetorix is called adulescens at BG 7.4, as is the Aeduan Convictolitavis at 7.32.4, who was one of two candidates in the disputed election for 52 BC. The Aeduan co-commanders at Alesia, Eporedorix and Viridomarus, are described as adulescentes (7.39.1 and 63.9). Princeps and legate The Helvii were a small polity on the northern border of the Narbonensis, southeast of the Arverni Caesar's identification of Troucillus's citizen status provides a piece of evidence for the history of Roman provincial administration in Gaul. Caesar notes that he is the son of Gaius Valerius Caburus, who was granted citizenship by G. Valerius Flaccus during his governorship in the 80s. Caburus took his patron's gentilic name, as was customary for naturalized citizens. Although Caburus's two sons retain a Celtic cognomen (personal name), by the third generation a member of such a family is likely to be using a more typically Roman name, and the Helvian Valerii cannot be identified further in the historical record.MacMullen, Romanization p. 99 online. The reference to Caburus's grant of citizenship in 83 BC helps date the term of Flaccus in his Transalpine province, and shows that Gauls were receiving Roman citizenship soon after annexation.Although Gallia Transalpina was brought under Roman control as a result of wars concluded in 120 BC, and the Roman colonia at Narbonne was established in 118, there is little evidence that the Narbonensis was regularly administered as a province till the 90s. Valerius Flaccus, a highly experienced administrator, had held one of the longest terms in the province until Caesar's proconsulship; see T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 363 online. As indicated by his closeness in age to Crassus and Brutus, Troucillus was born shortly before or after his father became a citizen, and was among the first Transalpiners to grow up with a dual Gallo-Roman identity. Although no title or rank is given for Troucillus, Caesar calls him a princeps Galliae provinciae, \\"a leading citizen of the Province of Gaul\\". His father, Caburus, is called princeps civitatisBellum Gallicum 7.65.2. of the Helvii, who are identified in this phrase not as a pagus, much less a \\"tribe\\" (Latin tribus), but as a civitas, a polity with at least small-scale urban centers (oppida).John Koch notes that the Gallo-Brittonic word corresponding to Caesar's usage of civitas is most likely *touta (Old Irish túath): \\"'tribe' would not be a perfect translation, but is less misleading than 'state,' 'city,' or 'nation'\\" Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2000), p. 450 online. John Drinkwater, however, argues in Roman Gaul: The Three Provinces, 58 BC–AD 260 (Cornell University Press, 1983), for \\"'nation' in the American Indian sense (made up of a number of tribes — Caesar's pagi\\" (p. 30, note 2; concept of civitas discussed in depth pp. 103–111). See also A.N. Sherwin-White on civitas, populus, municipium and oppidum in The Roman Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 1973) passim; if *touta is correctly translated as \\"a people,\\" the sense of civitas Helviorum might be analogous to that of the Roman People (populus) as a political entity. In his edition of Tacitus' Germania (Oxford University Press, 1999), J.B. Rives, drawing on Cicero's definition of civitas as \\"an assembly and gathering of men associated under law\\" (Republic 6.13), says that it is the usual word for a \\"community viewed under its political aspect,\\" equivalent to the Greek polis (p. 153). Further discussion by Olivier Büchsenschütz, \\"The Significance of Major Settlements in European Iron Age Society,\\" in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 53–64; consideration of the term \\"proto-state\\" by Patrice Brun, \\"From Chiefdom to State Organization,\\" in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State p. 7; see also Greg Woolf, \\"Urbanizing the Gauls,\\" in Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 106–141. In Gods, Temples, and Ritual Practices: The Transformation of Religious Ideas and Values in Roman Gaul (Amsterdam University Press, 1998), Ton Derks views the civitates of the Augustan era as \\"city-states\\": \\"a civitas was a community, whose constitution was shaped after the Roman example and whose social and political life was centred on a single town\\" (p. 39 online). It has been argued that princeps denotes a particular office in the Narbonensis,Laurent Lamoine, \\"Préteur, vergobret, princeps en Gaule Narbonnaise et dans les Trois Gaules: pourquoi faut-il reprendre le dossier?\\" in Les élites et leurs facettes: Les élites locales dans le monde hellénistique et romain (École française de Rome, 2003), p. 191 online, and Le pouvoir local en Gaule romaine (Presses Universitaires Blaise-Pascal, 2009), pp. 74–75 online. Christian Goudineau calls Troucillus \\"un prince helvien,\\" perhaps with the assumption that his father would have been a rix (Latin rex) had the Helvii not been under Roman rule. but the word is usually taken to mean simply a \\"leader\\" or \\"leading citizen.\\" Troucillus is listed among legates and envoys for 58 BC in Broughton's Magistrates of the Roman Republic.T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 198. Erich S. Gruen notes the presence of Troucillus among those who demonstrate that Caesar favored men of non-Roman and equestrian origin among his junior officers and lieutenants.Erich S. Gruen, \\"The 'First Triumvirate' and the Reaction,\\" in The Last Generation of the Roman Republic (University of California Press, 1974, reprinted 1995), pp. 117–118 online. Ronald Syme calls the Helvian \\"a cultivated and admirable young man.\\"Ronald Syme, The Origin of Cornelius Gallus,\\" Classical Quarterly 32 (1938), p. 41, reiterated in The Roman Revolution (Oxford University Press, 1939, reissued 2002), p. 75. Troucillus was accompanied on the mission to Ariovistus by Marcus Mettius (or Metius), a Roman who had a formal social relationship (hospitium) with the Suebian king. Since Ariovistus had been declared a Friend of the Roman People (amicus populi romani) during Caesar's consulship in 59 BC, the hospitium between him and Mettius might have had to do with the diplomacy that led to the declaration of friendship;This assumption is common enough to have been noted in a student textbook for Caesar's commentaries edited by Francis W. Kelsey (Boston, 1918), p. 117 online. business dealings involving goods, slaves, or animals are also not out of the question.In Caesar: Life of a Colossus (Yale University Press, 2006), Adrian Goldsworthy identifies Mettius, whose praenomen he gives erroneously as Caius, as a merchant (p. 229 online). Others have made a Romanized Gaul of Mettius. None of these have a basis in the text of the Bellum Gallicum. Caesar says only that Mettius had availed himself of the hospitium of Ariovistus (qui hospitio Ariovisti utebatur, BG 1.46.4), and provides no further information about the man's social rank, ethnicity, or occupation. In 60 BC, the senate had sent three legates on a diplomatic mission to shore up relations to key Gallic civitates, including the Aedui, against the threatened invasion or inducements of the Helvetii, whose entry into Allobrogian and Aeduan territory two years later provided Caesar with a casus belli. One of these legates was Lucius Valerius Flaccus, the nephew of the Valerius Flaccus who had granted Caburus's citizenship.Cicero, Ad Atticum 1.19.2–3 and 20.5. The senior legate was Metellus Creticus, under whom Flaccus had served in Crete earlier in the 60s. The other man was Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus (the praetor of 59 BC, not the consul of 72). Lucius had served under his uncle in the Narbonensis at the beginning of his career.For more on the governorship of Flaccus and his nephew's presence in Gaul during the civil wars of the 80s, see G. Valerius Flaccus: Role in civil war. Because of their ties to the Valerii Flacci, Troucillus or another member of his family might have traveled with Flaccus as interpreter or liaison. Caesar explains his decision to send Troucillus to Ariovistus on linguistic grounds, saying that the Suebian king had learned to speak Celtic.Commodissimum visum est C. Valerium <Troucillum> ... propter fidem et propter linguae Gallicae scientiam, qua multa iam Ariovistus longinqua consuetudine utebatur, et quod in eo peccandi Germanis causa non esset, ad eum mittere: \\"It seemed most advantageous to send C. Valerius Troucillus, because of his loyalty and his knowledge of the Gaulish language, in which Ariovistus had become quite fluent after his long exposure to it, and because there would be no cause for the Germans to find fault with him\\" (BG 1.46.4). Despite Caesar's assertion that the king should have no cause to find fault with Troucillus, Ariovistus immediately accuses the pair of envoys of spying and refuses to allow them to speak. He has Troucillus thrown in chains. Such treatment of envoys was a violation of the ius gentium, the customary law of international relations,Daniel Peretz, \\"The Roman Interpreter and His Diplomatic and Military Roles,\\" Historia 55 (2006), p. 454. but it has been observed that Ariovistus's charge may not have been groundless.John H. Collins, “Caesar as Political Propagandist,” in Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt 1.1 (1972), p. 930 online: \\"it is hard to avoid the feeling that if we had an independent report of the incident from the German side we should learn that the envoys' conduct was not quite so diplomatically correct as Caesar has represented it\\"; see also N.J.E. Austin and N.B. Rankov Exploratio: Military and Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople (Routledge, 1995), p. 55. Troucillus is held by the Suebi until the decisive battle, in which the Romans are victorious. Caesar gives the recovery of the young Celt an emphatic place in the penultimate paragraph of the book; several scholars\\"Cette affection s'exprime en termes plus chaleureux\\" (\\"this affection is expressed in the warmest terms\\"), Ernest Desjardins, Géographie historique et administrative de la Gaule romaine (Paris, 1878), p. 512 online; the story demonstrates Caesar's \\"warm heart for friendship\\" observes Ernst Riess, reviewing a teaching text of the Bellum Gallicum in Classical Weekly 3 (1909–1910), p. 132; William Warde Fowler perceives a \\"genuine feeling\\" that \\"helps us to understand the secret of Caesar's wonderful influence over other men,\\" Julius Caesar and the Foundation of the Roman Imperial System (New York and London: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1892), p. 160 online; Christian Goudineau, César et la Gaule (Paris: Errance, 1990), p. 240 (\\"un des très rares moments de la Guerre des Gaules où César exprime une émotion\\"); an emotion rare in the war commentaries noted also by T.P. Wiseman, “The Publication of De Bello Gallico,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter, pp. 1–9; Ronald Syme, The Provincial at Rome (University of Exeter Press, 1999), p. 64, noting the \\"providential delivery Caesar recounts in moving words\\"; and \\"a notable exception to Caesar's generally objective tone in his narrative,\\" Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, Ancient Rome from the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar (Routledge, 2005), p. 86 online. have detected a degree of personal warmth in the passage that is atypical of the commentaries: A 19th-century illustration depicting the chained Troucillus in the moment before his rescue by Julius Caesar In his discussion of racial stereotyping among the Romans, A.N. Sherwin-White takes note of this passage in Caesar's overall depiction of Ariovistus as \\"an impossible person\\" who thought \\"nothing of frying an envoy.\\"A.N. Sherwin- White, Racial Prejudice in Imperial Rome (Cambridge University Press, 1967), pp. 14 and 17. For reasons that are unclear, the Roman Mettius seems to have received better treatment during his captivity than did the Celtic envoy.Andrew Wallace-Hadrill suggests that the preexisting guest-friend connection (hospitium) between Mettius and Ariovistus accounts for this preferential treatment; see Patronage in Ancient Society (Routledge, 1989), p. 140 online. The episode allows Caesar himself to display by contrast the aristocratic virtue of treating one's dependent friends well, which fosters obligations that enhance the important man's prestige.Steve Mason references the example of Caesar's friendship with Troucillus in Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary (Brill, 2001), p. 166, note 1718 online. Religious significance H.R. Ellis Davidson views the casting of lots and proposed immolation of Troucillus as a form of human sacrifice in the context of Germanic religious practice.H.R. Ellis Davidson, Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions (Manchester University Press, 1988), p. 61 online. Both Celtic and Germanic peoples were said to practice human sacrifice, and it had been banned from Roman religious use by law only about forty years before the Gallic War.Banned in 97 BC during the consulship of P. Licinius Crassus, the grandfather of the Publius Crassus who served as an officer under Caesar, and Cn. Cornelius Lentulus, according to Pliny, Historia naturalis 30.3.12 (Latin text). For human sacrifice in Rome, see J.S. Reid, \\"Human Sacrifices at Rome and Other Notes on Roman Religion,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 2 (1912) 34–52. A notable rite of human sacrifice in Rome was the live burial of one Greek couple and one Gallic couple in the Forum Boarium in 228 BC; see Briggs L. Twyman, \\"Metus Gallicus: The Celts and Roman Human Sacrifice,\\" Ancient History Bulletin 11 (1997) 1–11; multiple instances in T.P. Wiseman, Remus (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 118 ff (\\"three times in the later history of the Republic the Romans resorted to human sacrifice to ward off a Gallic invasion\\"). Several Greek and Roman literary sources document human sacrifice among the Celts, as does archaeology, explored particularly by Jean-Louis Brunaux, for whom see: “Gallic Blood Rites,” Archaeology 54 (March/April 2001), 54–57; Les sanctuaires celtiques et leurs rapports avec le monde mediterranéean, Actes de colloque de St-Riquier (8 au 11 novembre 1990) organisés par la Direction des Antiquités de Picardie et l’UMR 126 du CNRS (Paris: Éditions Errance, 1991); “La mort du guerrier celte. Essai d’histoire des mentalités,” in Rites et espaces en pays celte et méditerranéen. Étude comparée à partir du sanctuaire d’Acy-Romance (Ardennes, France) (École française de Rome, 2000). In his ethnography Germania, Tacitus notes that divination by means of lots was pervasive among the Germans,The term Germani as an ethnic designation is problematic; this article takes no position on the ethnic specifics of Tacitus's referent. and records a rite of human sacrifice among the Semnones, \\"the most ancient and noble of the Suebi,\\" that involves binding the participant in a chain; in his edition, J.B. Rives connects the practice to the incident involving Troucillus.Tacitus, Germania 10 and 39; J.B. Rives (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 165 online. Tacitus describes the use of twigs with markings in the casting of lots, and it has been suggested that these were used to cast the lots for Troucillus, with the markings an early form of runes.Rochus von Liliencron :de:Rochus von Liliencron and Karl Müllenoff, Zur Runenlehre (Halle, 1852), pp. 29–30 and 38 online. The authors explicitly connect the casting of lots three times over Troucillus to the Frisian practice described following. An 8th-century source says that the Germanic Frisians cast lots over a period of three days to determine the death penalty in cases of sacrilege,Alcuin, Life of Willibrord 11, as cited by Giorgio Ausenda, After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians (Boydell Press, 1995), p. 260 online. and the lots were cast three times for Troucillus; spying in the guise of diplomatic envoy would violate the sacred trust under the aegis of hospitium. The Helvii and Roman politics No polity within Caesar's Narbonese province joined the pan-Gallic rebellion of 52 BC, nor engaged in any known acts of hostility against Rome during the war. The family of Troucillus, in fact, plays a key role in securing Caesar's rear militarily against Vercingetorix, who sent forces to invade Helvian territory. In his 1861 history of the Vivarais,L'Abbé Rouchier, \\"L'Helvie à l'époque gauloise et sous la domination romaine,\\" in Histoire religieuse, civile et politique du Vivarais (Paris, 1861), vol. 1, pp. 3–65, especially pp. 48–52 on Troucillus (under the name Procillus). Abbé Rouchier conjectured that Caesar, seeing the strategic utility of Helvian territory on the border of the Roman province along a main route into central Gaul, was able to cultivate the Valerii by redressing punitive measures taken against the civitas by Pompeius Magnus (\\"Pompey the Great\\") in the 70s. During the secession of Quintus Sertorius in Spain, Celtic polities in Mediterranean Gaul were subjected to troop levies and forced requisitions to support the military efforts of Metellus Pius, Pompeius, and other Roman commanders against the rebels. Some Celts, however, supported Sertorius. After the renegade Roman was assassinated, Metellus and Pompeius were able to declare a victory, and the Helvii along with the Volcae Arecomici were forced to cede a portion of their lands to the Greek city-state Massilia (present-day Marseilles), a loyal independent ally of Rome for centuries, located strategically at the mouth of the Rhône. Caesar mentions the land forfeiture in his account of the civil war, without detailing Helvian actions against Rome.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 1.35. During the Roman civil wars of the 40s, Massilia chose to maintain its longstanding relationship with Pompeius even in isolation, as the Gallic polities of the Narbonensis continued to support Caesar.Stéphane Mauné, \\"La centuriation de Béziers B et l'occupation du sol de la vallée de l'Hérault au Ie av. J.-C.,\\" in Histoire, espaces et marges de l'Antiquité: Hommages à Monique Clavel Lévêque (Presses Universitaires Franc-Comtoises, 2003), vol. 2, p. 73 online. The Massiliots were besieged and defeated by Caesar, and as a result lost their independence, as well as possibly the land they had taken from the Helvii. Rouchier presents an extended portrait of Troucillus in his history, viewing the educated young Celt through Caesar's eyes as an example of a visionary meritocracy in Rome.Noting \\"sa bravoure, la noblesse de son caractère, les facultés brillantes d'un esprit qui, pour parâitre supérieur, n'avait besoin que de culture\\": Rouchier, pp. 48–49. For Caesar's grants of citizenship and senatorial rank to Gauls, including \\"trousered Gauls\\" of Transalpina, see Humanitas, virtus and becoming Roman following. Humanitas, virtus and becoming Roman During his dictatorship, Caesar extended full rights of Roman citizenship to ethnically Celtic Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), and filled the roll of the Roman senate with controversial appointments that included Cisalpine and possibly a few Narbonese Gauls. Although accusations of degrading the senate with uncivilized \\"trouser-wearing Gauls\\"A jibe in poetic form is recorded by Suetonius, Divus Iulius 80.2: \\"Caesar led the Gauls in triumph and likewise into the senate house; the Gauls took off their trousers and put on the wide stripe\\" (Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit, idem in curiam / Galli bracas deposuerunt, latum clavum sumpserunt). were exaggerations meant to disparage Caesar's inclusive efforts, Ronald Syme has pointed out that men such as Troucillus and Trogus were educated citizens worthy of such appointments: Troucillus's fluent bilingualism is asserted by Caesar. The French scholar Christian Goudineau found it \\"perplexing\\" to have Caesar take special note that a native Gaul spoke Gaulish, and suggests that this emphasis on Troucillus's retention of what should have been his first language indicates that the Helvian had been given the same education as a Roman, perhaps even in Rome and maybe as a hostage.Christian Goudineau, César et la Gaule (Paris: Errance, 1990), p. 74. See also L'Abbé Rouchier, \\"L'Helvie à l'époque gauloise et sous la domination romaine,\\" in Histoire religieuse, civile et politique du Vivarais (Paris, 1861), vol. 1, p. 88. For Roman and Celtic practices of hostage-taking in this period, see discussion of Publius Crassus's hostage crisis in Armorica in 56 BC. Syme points out that the Gauls of the Provincia had direct exposure to the Greek language and to Hellenic culture through the regional influence of Massilia,The Provincial at Rome p. 58 online. which had well-established contact with the Helvii (see \\"The Helvii and Roman politics\\" above). The cultural and linguistic complexity of Mediterranean Gaul is asserted by Varro, who says Massilia is \\"trilingual, because they speak Greek, Latin, and Gaulish.\\"Varro (the famous polymath, not Varro Atacinus) as quoted by Isidore of Seville, Origines 15.1.63, trilingues quod et graece loquantur et latine et gallice; Edgar C. Polomé, \\"The Linguistic Situation in the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire,\\" Augstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt II (De Gruyter, 1983), p. 527 online; Philip Freeman, Ireland and the Classical World (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001), p. 15 online. Caesar employs two abstract nouns from the Roman moral vocabulary to describe Troucillus: he is said to be outstanding for his humanitas and his virtus.Christian Goudineau translates these qualities into French as \\"sa grande valeur\\" and \\"sa haute culture\\" (César et la Gaule, p. 74). Humanitas was \\"a keyword for late Republican elite self-definition\\";Brian A. Krostenko, \\"Beyond (Dis)belief: Rhetorical Form and Religious Symbol in Cicero's De Divinatione,\\" Transactions of the American Philological Association 130 (2000), p. 364. The word humanitas first begins to be used regularly at this time, and its meaning evolves in later Latin literature. it embraced a range of ideals including culture, civilization, education, and goodwill toward one's fellow human beings. Cicero considered humanitas to be one of Caesar's own outstanding qualities,Cicero uses the word humanitas five times in the speech Pro Ligario in regard to Caesar, as noted by William C. McDermott, \\"In Ligarianam,\\" Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 101 (1970), p. 336. Also John H. Collins, “Caesar and the Corruption of Power,” Historia 4 (1955), pp. 451, 455. and often pairs it with lepos, \\"charm\\"; in his speech arguing for the extension of Caesar's proconsular command, he distinguishes Roman culture from Gallic by mockingly asking whether \\"the culture and charm of those people and nations\\" could possibly be the attraction for Caesar, rather than the war's usefulness to the state (utilitas rei publicae).De provinciis consularibus 29: hominum nationumque illarum humanitas et lepos. Brian A. Krostenko, Cicero, Catullus, and the Language of Social Performance (University of Chicago Press, 2001), pp. 193–194 online: \\"Even in this relatively straightforward, humorous passage the exclusionary force of the language of social performance is plainly present.\\" Cicero also associates humanitas with speaking well, the ability to hold a cultivated conversation free of vulgarity and to speak in an urbane manner.Krostenko, Cicero, Catullus, and the language of social performance pp. 197, 212 et passim. See also Lindsay Hall on Caesar's \\"linguistic nationalism,\\" \\"Ratio and Romanitas in the Bellum Gallicum,\\" in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter, pp. 11–43. A hundred and fifty years later, Tacitus takes a more cynical view of humanitas as an illusion of civilization that is in fact submission to the dominant culture.W.J. Slater, \\"Handouts at Dinner,\\" Phoenix 54 (2000), p. 120. Tacitus observes that as governor of Roman Britain, Agricola had engaged in a program of The Roman concept of humanitas as it took shape in the 1st century BC has been criticized from a postcolonial perspective as a form of imperialism, \\"a civilizing mission: it was Rome's destiny and duty to spread humanitas to other races, tempering barbarian practices and instituting the pax Romana.\\"Jane Webster, \\"Creolizing the Roman Provinces,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 105 (2001), p. 210, quoting also Greg Woolf, \\"Beyond Romans and Natives,\\" World Archaeology 28 (1997), p. 55: \\"despite its applicability to humankind, humanitas embodied 'concepts of culture and conduct that were regarded by the Romans as the hallmarks of the aristocracy in particular.'\\" The word humanitas appears only twice throughout the entirety of Caesar's Bellum Gallicum, both times in Book 1. In the famous opening, in which the commander parcels out Gaul into three divisions (Belgae ... Aquitani ... Celtae, 1.1.1) for potential conquest, Caesar reports that the Belgic Gauls are the bravest (fortissimi) fighters, \\"because they are at the farthest remove from the cultivation (cultus) and civilization (humanitas) of the Province.\\"Propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt. By contrast, Troucillus is said to possess the highest level of both humanitas and virtus.Summa virtute et humanitate (BG 1.46.4). Cicero also collocates humanitas and virtus, as at De oratore 3.1 and 57. In his speech Pro Flacco, delivered on behalf of Lucius Flaccus, Cicero associates humanitas with Athens and virtus with Sparta (62–63). Virtus, which shares a semantic element with the Latin word vir, \\"man,\\"Gendered, as distinguished from homo, homines, \\"people, human beings.\\" is most commonly translated by either \\"virtue\\" or \\"courage, valor\\"; it is \\"the quality of manliness or manhood.\\"Elaine Fantham, \\"The Ambiguity of Virtus in Lucan's Civil War and Statius' Thebiad,\\" Arachnion 3 online. As an active quality, appropriate to the man of action,\\"Although battlefields might be thought to be its best proving grounds, Cicero used the term [virtus] to denote general excellence in other areas of activity, ... all with the notion that it was something that existed only in action,\\" notes Andrew J.E. Bell, \\"Cicero and the Spectacle of Power,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 87 (1997), p. 9. See also Edwin S. Ramage, “Aspects of Propaganda in the De bello gallico: Caesar’s Virtues and Attributes,” Athenaeum 91 (2003) 331–372. Ramage sees humanitas as belonging to a class of virtues encompassing \\"kindness and generosity,\\" associated in Caesar with qualities such as clementia (\\"clemency, leniency\\"), beneficium (\\"service, favor, benefit\\"), benevolentia (\\"goodwill, benevolence\\"), indulgentia or indulgeo (\\"leniency, mildness, kindness, favor,\\" or the verbal action of granting these), mansuetudo (\\"mildness\\"), misericordia (\\"compassion, pity\\"), and liberalitas or liberaliter (\\"generosity\\" or to do something \\"freely, generously, liberally\\"). virtus balances the potentially enervating effects of civilization in the natural aristocrat.Rhiannon Evans, Utopia Antiqua: Readings of the Golden Age and Decline at Rome (Routledge, 2008), pp. 156–157 online. Caesar's prolific use of the word virtus — fourteen instances in Book 1 alone, in reference to Celtic nations as a whole,Helvetii (1.1.4, 1.2.2, 1.13.4 thrice), Boii (1.28.4), Aedui (1.31.7). and to the Roman armyBellum Gallicum 1.40.4 and 1.51.1, and of the 10th Legion in particular at 1.40.15. — points to \\"no easily articulated essential meaning\\": \\"Virtus was whatever it was that Romans liked when they saw it.\\"Andrew J.E. Bell, \\"Cicero and the Spectacle of Power,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 87 (1997), p. 9. Ariovistus claims the quality for his Germani and for himself (BG 1.36.7 and 1.44.1), but while this German virtus is affirmed by Gauls and merchants, causing unease among the army, it is downplayed by Caesar (1.39.1 and 1.40.8). On the rhetoric of virtus and competing claims to it in the Bellum Gallicum, see Louis Rawlings, “Caesar’s Portrayal of Gauls as Warriors,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter (Classical Press of Wales, 1998). Although the word appears frequently throughout the Bellum Gallicum, Caesar attributes the quality of virtus to only a few individuals: Troucillus; three Roman officers;Gaius Volusenus (3.5.2), Quintus Cicero (5.48.6), and Titus Labienus (7.59.6); see Myles Anthony McDonnell, Roman manliness: virtus and the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 308 online. The centurions Vorenus and Pullo bandy the word between themselves at 5.44. and two Celts, Commius of the Atrebates and Tasgetius of the Carnutes.Commius at Bellum Gallicum 4.21.7, the only instance of the word virtus in Book 4; Tasgetius at 5.25.2, in noting that having been installed as king by Caesar, he was murdered by his own people three years into his reign. The Bellum Gallicum audience T.P. Wiseman saw the role of Troucillus in Bellum Gallicum 1 as one indication of the breadth of Caesar's intended audience. Wiseman argues that the commentaries were first published serially,At one time, the dominant scholarly view held that the Commentarii were published as a collection, reworked from Caesar's annual report as proconsul to the Roman senate; internal contradictions, narrative discontinuities, and gaffes (such as Caesar's insistence on the loyalty of Commius of the Atrebates, and his failure to anticipate the uprising of Vercingetorix and the Arverni and the Aedui) are among the questions that cause scholars to find serial publication more likely, with the collected edition appearing as a public relations effort at the outset of Caesar's civil war with Pompeius Magnus and the senatorial elite. with a year-by-year account to keep Caesar and his achievements vivid in the mind of the public (populus) on whose support he counted as a popularist leader. The seven individual books were then collected and supplemented by Aulus Hirtius at the end of the 50s or beginning of the 40s. \\"Publication\\" in ancient Rome relied less on the circulation of written copies than on public and private readings, which were an important form of entertainment; this circumstance, Wiseman intuits, goes a long way toward explaining Caesar's narrative use of the third person in regard to himself, since the audience would be hearing the words spoken by a reader. In addition to public relations efforts among the Roman people, Wiseman believes that Caesar would have sent readers to the Narbonensis, the Mediterranean region of Gaul already under Roman administration, because he required Narbonese support at his back if he was to succeed in independent Gaul. The prominent attention given to the recovery of Troucillus from the Suebi at the end of Book 1, and the unusual warmth with which Caesar speaks of him, suggests that the proconsul valued his friends to the south and was careful to show it.T.P. Wiseman, “The Publication of De Bello Gallico,” in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter, pp. 1–9. In another indication of Narbonese regard for Caesar, the poet Varro Atacinus,Varro Atacinus, or P. Terentius Varro, was a native of the Narbonensis, identified by his toponymic cognomen as associated with the Aude River (ancient Atax) and thus distinguished from the more famous Varro; whether he was an ethnic Celt or a Roman colonist can be debated. Though his work survives only in fragments, the Augustan poets regarded him highly. the contemporary of Troucillus, wrote an epic poem called the Bellum Sequanicum (Sequanian War), no longer extant, about the first year of Caesar's war in Gaul.Edward Courtney, The Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 235–253.

It was founded in the 12th century, and a great many of its parish records survive. The Church According to Sir John Gilbert the church was built in 1168 by a native Irishman called Giolla Michell.Gilbert (1854) It was then attached to the Church of the Most Holy Trinity (Christ Church), which was run by the Augustinian Order. Fishamble Street in those times reached only as far as the Music Hall, the rest, where the church was located, was called Bothestret. In the church there was a chapel to St. Mary and one to St. John, which was used by the Guild of Tailors.Hughes, p. 18 In the 14th century at Easter a Miracle Play, on the subject of the Resurrection, was performed in the church.Ossory: Dublin Theatrics An Arland Ussher (died 1557), nephew of the Mayor of Dublin, rebuilt the church. The new church consisted of a chancel, nave and two aisles. There were vaults underneath the church and a belfry contained three bells.Hughes, p. 22 The church was re-built in 1681. Its walls were only 24 feet (7.5 meters) high. There were 42 pews, which were shared among several families. The names Bladen, Hutchinson, Forster, Crumpe, Crossart, Thompson, Grimes, Reeves, Stacey and Shipley, among others, are recorded. In the mid 18th-century a committee was formed to raise funds for yet another renovation of the church. They were successful in raising thousands of pounds from the government and smaller sums from other sources, so that the church was rebuilt and re-opened in 1773. The pews were auctioned to the highest bidders, providing those with the most money with the best seats. Alderman Robert Smith contributed funds to buy an organ, from William Gibson of Grafton St., but unfortunately it never worked properly. The church was closed in 1878, after the parish was united with that of St. Werburgh. The pulpit and other pieces were taken to that church. The churchyard There was a graveyard attached to the church; the first tombstone mentioned is that of William Scriven, in 1681. Many titled people, aldermen, sheriffs, members of parliament, lawyers, clergy, lord mayors, and scholars were buried there. The last mentioned is that of Elizabeth Frances McAusland in 1850. It is estimated that there were more than 12,500 burials in total.Dublin's burial grounds and graveyards, by Vivien Igoe. Wolfhound, Dublin, 2001 The parish The parish, which covered the area around the now closed Catholic Church of St. Michael and John, was a union of two older divisions: St. John's and St. Olaf's. The latter, founded in the first half of the 11th century, commemorated Olaf I, King of Norway, and its church was located in what is present-day Essex St. The parishes were formally united in 1558.Hughes, p. 13 The parish corresponded with the civil parish of St. John. Notable parishioners In 1748, Thomas Sheridan paid for a pew for the use of his players in the Smock Alley theatre.Hughes, p. 28 In 1746, Henry Grattan was born nearby and baptised at this church.Ossory: Distinguished Dubliners The writer John Duncan Craig was curate here in the mid-1850s.

Early history  The idea for the group came when soprano saxophonist Bhob Rainey decided to embark upon an ambitious cross- country tour, choosing trumpeter Greg Kelley and percussionist Tatsuya Nakatani as his travelmates. The three, who had been playing together in various groups for a number of months prior (most notably with multi- instrumentalist Masashi Harada), then began rehearsing regularly as a trio and recorded their first album at Studio 7A West in Charlestown, Massachusetts that summer. The album was released as 44'38\\"/5 by the Twisted Village label and the group began their 6-week cross-country tour in November of that year. 2 weeks into the tour nmperign became a duo, with Nakatani departing for personal reasons. Releasing an album of quiet abstract improvisations on a psych label and touring across the country garnered the group some attention. And despite Rainey's move to Chicago in 1999, the group remained very active that year, beginning their ongoing collaboration with electronic musician Jason Lescalleet, travelling out to the West Coast for a number of concerts and making a 7-week cross-country tour later that fall. All of this activity resulted in the release of This is nmperign's 2nd CD on Twisted Village (which featured the group's last performance with Nakatani and their first performance with Lescalleet) and the collaborative CD In Which The Silent Partner-Director Is No Longer Able To Make His Point To The Industrial Dreamer with Jason Lescalleet on Intransitive Recordings. By the year 2000, Rainey was back in Boston and the group embarked on their first tour of Europe. It was at this time that the group began its relationships with a number of European improvisers including Axel Dörner and Andrea Neumann, with whom the duo would embark on a 4-week United States tour in September 2001. Over the next few years, nmperign continued to travel the United States and Europe, including tours on both continents with percussionist Le Quan Ninh and dancer Yukiko Nakamura, an inexplicable pairing with noise provocateur Emil Beaulieau (including some collaborations which came to be known as nmpeRRRon), and collaborations with Jerome Noetinger & Lionel Marchetti, and Gunter Müller. The BSC The BSC was formed in 2000 by Bhob Rainey as a way to explore the dynamics of large group improvisation. The group also includes his nmperign partner Greg Kelley on trumpet, Mike Bullock on double bass, James Coleman on theremin, Chris Cooper on prepared guitar, Vic Rawlings on cello & electronics, Howard Stelzer on tapes, and Liz Tonne on voice. The group has released one CD on Grob entitled Good (2003) and has collaborated a number of times with pianist Steve Drury and his Callithumpian Consort (performing graphic scores by Stockhausen, Cardew and Christian Wolff), as well as with composer Christian Wolff in a realization of his graphic score, Edges. In 2010, the group released 23% Bicycle and/or Ribbons of the Natural Order, a download-only release which was made available by posting a tweet or \\"liking\\" it on Facebook. Damon and Naomi In 2004, Damon and Naomi, via their mutual friends at Twisted Village, invited nmperign to play on a bill with them and subsequently to play on their new album, which would be the first on their own 20|20|20 label. Rainey and Kelley appeared on a number of tracks on their 2005 album The Earth is Blue and also began performing live with the duo and guitarist Michio Kurihara. Rainey became a touring member of the group and has performed with them throughout the United States, Europe and Japan. Both Kelley and Rainey have appeared on subsequent recordings with Rainey handling all the string and horn arrangements on their 2007 album Within These Walls. Salt Peanuts A seeming anomaly in the discography of nmperign is the 2003 CDr release Salt Peanuts released on American Tapes. Released in an edition of 80, the recording showcases 12 maniacal takes of the \\"head\\" section of the title standard as well 12 takes of the \\"head\\" of Donna Lee. Apparently the result of some good-natured heckling by John Olson and Aaron Dilloway of Wolf Eyes at the 2003 De Stijl/Freedom From Festival in Minneapolis, the recording showcases nmperign's sense of humor and conceptual rigorousness. Points of reference Despite the fact that the title of their first album was not a reference to John Cage (but simply the total time of the album divided by the number of tracks), nmperign has used a number of literary and other references in their titles, ranging from Marguerite Duras' The Malady of Death and Four Novels, Georges Bataille's Poems, Zen Master Eihei Dogen, a book of interviews with Jean-Luc Godard, Herman Melville's Pierre; Or, the Ambiguities, a box of Chinese tea, The Doors and micromosaic artist Henry Dalton. The name nmperign itself is derived from the Latin phrase \\"igNotuM PER IGNotius,\\" meaning \\"the unknown through the more unknown.\\" 2009 - In 2009, Rainey moved out of Boston to New Orleans. This move was ironically timed with a renewed spate of activity from the band with the release of Ommatidia (their first duo recording since 2004's double LP We Devote Every Effort To Offer You The Best That You Deserve To Have For Your Enjoyment) on Intransitive Recordings and a 1-sided collaborative LP with percussionist Jake Meginsky on Rel Records entitled Selected Occasions of Handsome Deceit. The group's only performance as nmperign since Rainey's move was at the 2010 Neon Marshmallow Festival in Chicago, as a trio with Jason Lescalleet.

Sigerist in 1929 Henry Ernest Sigerist (7 April 1891 in Paris, France – 17 March 1957 in Pura, Switzerland) was a Swiss medical historian.Henry Ernest Sigerist. Encyclopædia Britannica Career After graduating with an M.D. at the University of Zurich in 1917, Sigerist devoted himself to the study of the history of medicine. Socialized Medicine in the Soviet Union (1937), and History of Medicine were among his most important works. He emerged as a major spokesman for \\"compulsory health insurance\\". From 1932 to 1947 he was director at Johns Hopkins University institute of history of medicine. He received financial aid from the Rockefeller Institute. He attacked the American Medical Association because of his conflicting views on socialized medicine. Dr. Sigerist was influential in the creation of socialized medicine in Canada. He made four trips to Canada in the 1930s and 1940s at the invitation of various medical groups to speak on this topic. Under his influence, Saskatchewan introduced state-funded medical and hospital care for pensioners, people on welfare and cancer patients after being hired to write a report in 1944 by Tommy Douglas the socialist Premier of that Canadian province. This was the basis for the eventual adoption of government funded health care in all of Canada. Obituaries and influence Sigerist died in 1957, and his passing was mourned among many in the medical community, although his views on socialized medicine were often glossed over in obituaries in national newspapers. Although Sigerist's influence waned during the mid 1900s, he has slowly become an important figure again in medical history. In 1999 an article in Hopkins Medical News described his view that \\"the entire history of medicine was spiraling toward one inevitable end: socialized medicine.\\" and said that \\"he invested all his enthusiasm on the wrong horse - the Soviet Union\\". An organization of medical historians have named themselves the Sigerist Circle, and books such as Making Medical History: The Life and Times of Henry E. Sigerist by Theodore M.

Written by English and Erick Kastel, based on a screenplay by Stephen McDool, the cast includes James Purefoy, Brian Cox, Kate Mara, Paul Giamatti, Vladimir Kulich, Mackenzie Crook, Jason Flemyng, Derek Jacobi, and Charles Dance. The film chronicles the siege of Rochester Castle by King John in 1215. The film was shot entirely in Wales in 2009 and produced on a budget of $25 million. Plot A prologue describes how the barons of England, aided by the Knights Templar, fought against tyrannical King John in a war that lasted more than three years. It ended with the King signing Magna Carta, a document granting rights to all English freemen. King John regrets succumbing to the pressure of the barons to sign Magna Carta. Soon after, he hires an army of pagan Danish mercenaries under the leadership of a warlord, Captain Tiberius, to restore John's absolute authority over the kingdom, under the presumption that the Pope has agreed to keep Christian missionaries out of their lands in Denmark. The Abbot Marcus leads three Templar knights (who have taken vows of silence) on a pilgrimage to Canterbury and they take shelter from the rain at Darnay Castle. One of the knights, Thomas Marshall, is assured by the abbot that Marshall's release from the Templar Order will be sought at Canterbury. By morning, King John arrives at the castle with his army and mercenaries. Baron Darnay signed Magna Carta and in retribution John orders him hanged. The Abbot attempts to intervene and the King orders that the abbot's tongue be cut off. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall escapes the castle on horseback carrying the abbot; the two knights left behind are slain. The abbot dies before night of his wound, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain. Once he has reached Canterbury, Marshall meets with Archbishop Langton, the author of Magna Carta, and Baron William d'Aubigny, a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be excommunicated for writing Magna Carta. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do so is Rochester Castle, the seat of Baron Cornhill and a strategic stronghold that controls southern England and allows access to London and the rest of the country. Rochester Castle d'Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire, Guy, and a petty criminal named Jedediah, but a fourth turns down the baron's call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for Rochester where, on arriving, they discover several Danish mercenaries have already claimed the castle; the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny's party fights and kills the Danes, and then claim Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Cornhill. When John's army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men leave if they wish; none accept. A second assault sees the Danes' siege tower destroyed by a trebuchet crafted by the defenders from within the castle. John's forces then attempt to starve out the defenders. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off in haste to expedite affairs. As the season turns to winter, the hunger of the castle's occupants continue; Marshall leaves the castle under cover of night and then returns ahead of his pursuers with food stolen from the Danish camp. The castle morale is bolstered by Marshall's act and he gives in to the advances of Cornhill's young wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows. The Danish leader, Tiberius, threatened by John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next attack and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos, d'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight's battle armour and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep. Aubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then hurled by the castle trebuchet into a keep wall. Cornhill tries to surrender but is stopped; he goes instead upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself. John's engineers have been preparing a mine under the keep's foundation, and they have a herd of pigs brought and put in the mine which is then stoked, set afire and the animal fat used to damage the keep's foundation, causing it to collapse; as the keep's walls come down, the final assault begins. The last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, the latter knocked unconscious by falling rubble. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed, until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after a long and savage duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and French army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order. Acknowledging England's new king with a nod, Marshall rides off with Isabel, while Guy tells his dead baron that \\"We held\\". The epilogue describes King John's death during his retreat and the reconstruction of Rochester Castle, and how it, like Magna Carta, still stands.

Fictional elements The film is only loosely based on reality. d'Aubigny commanded the garrison but contemporary chroniclers do not agree on how many men it consisted of. Estimates range from 95 to 140 knights supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. John did take the castle, most of the higher nobles being imprisoned or banished; and the French did not arrive in England until some six months after the siege had ended. Characters departing significantly from the historical record include d'Aubigny, who was not an ennobled wool merchant (nor was he tortured and killed in the siege). 19th century map of medieval Rochester showing the proximity of the castle, cathedral and city The closing narration explains that this was one of the first victories that the French had that would eventually lead to total victory. However, not mentioned in the narration was that after John's death in 1216, many of the English rebels preferred a weak English king in the person of nine-year-old Henry III over an experienced French monarch and thus rallied around Henry. The rebellion was defeated by royalist supporters in 1217. While the castle itself is depicted realistically, the nearby Norman cathedral and the city of Rochester itself are completely missing from the location shots. In reality, the cathedral is only a few hundred yards from the castle walls and Rochester has been a substantial settlement since Roman times. The film's Danes are depicted as Hungarian-speaking Viking-like pagans when Denmark had been Christianized by that time. Also, King John's mercenaries were mostly Flemish, Provençals and Aquitainians, not Danes. Thomas Marshal, the main character played by James Purefoy, is based loosely upon medieval knight and statesman William Marshal. The movie has the Knights Templar as amongst the ringleaders in the battle against John Lackland. In reality, the Templars and King John had a cordial relation and they were one of the few powerful groups in England which John did not offend or alienate during his reign, and the order was amongst his financial backers providing him with the necessary funds to wage war.Jones, Dan, The Templars. The Rise and Fall of God's Holy Warriors, London, Head of Zeus, 2017, , p. 224. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 55 critics.IRONCLAD Manohla Dargis, writing from The New York Times criticized the film for its emphasis on violent action scenes above a cohesive plot, stating that \\" “Ironclad” alternately feels, plays and sounds like an abridged television mini-series and a feature-length video game,\\" and that \\"the action is cluttered and the story overly compressed,\\" but conceded that the film was enthusiastic in its pursuit of violence to entertain.

The two chorioamniotic membranes are the amnion and the chorion, which make up the amniotic sac that surrounds and protects the fetus.UpToDate Patient Preview > Fetal membranes: Anatomy and biochemistry Author: Seth Guller, PhD. Retrieved on Mars 7, 2010 The other fetal membranes are the allantois and the secondary umbilical vesicle.Clinically Oriented Embryology Keith L Moore  Structure  The fetal membranes surround the developing embryo and form the fetal-maternal interface. The fetal membranes are derived from the outer trophoblast layer of the implanting blastocyst. The trophoblast layer differentiates into amnion and the chorion, which then comprise the fetal membranes. The amnion is the innermost layer and, therefore, contacts the amniotic fluid, the fetus and the umbilical cord. The internal pressure of the amniotic fluid causes the amnion to be passively attached to the chorion. The chorion functions to separate the amnion from the maternal decidua and uterus.  Development of the fetal membranes  Initially, the amnion is separated from the chorion by chorionic fluid. The fusion of the amnion and chorion is completed at the 12th week of development.  Histology and microanatomy   Amnion  The amnion is avascular, meaning it does not contain its own blood vessels. Therefore, it must obtain necessary nutrients and oxygen from nearby chorionic and amniotic fluid, and fetal surface vessels. The amnion is characterised by cuboidal and columnar epithelial layers. The columnar cells are located in the vicinity of the placenta, whereas the cuboidal cells are found in the periphery. During early pregnancy, the amnionic epithelium is sparsely covered in microvilli, which increase in number throughout pregnancy. The function of this microvillous surface is associated with a densely-packed glycocalix with anionic binding sites; these are thought to be involved with intra-amnionic lipid synthesis. This amnionic epithelium is connected to a basement membrane, which is then attached by filaments to a connective tissue layer.  Chorion  The chorionic membrane is a fibrous tissue layer containing the fetal blood vessels. Chorionic villi form on the outer surface of the chorion, which maximise surface area for contact with maternal blood. The chorionic villi are involved in fetal-maternal exchange.  Function  The fetal membrane surrounds the fetus during the gestational period and ensures maintenance of pregnancy to delivery, protection of the fetus as well as being critical in maintaining the conditions necessary for fetal health.  Barrier function  The fetal membranes separate maternal tissue from fetal tissue at a basic mechanical level. The fetal membrane is composed of a thick cellular chorion covering a thin amnion composed of dense collagen fibrils. The amnion is in contact with the amniotic fluid and ensures structural integrity of the sac due to its mechanical strength. The underlying chorion is fused to the decidua at the maternal-fetal interface. This interaction is vital in controlling the local immune systems which in turn is vital for maintaining a semi-allogeneic fetus. At the end of gestation, a 'weak zone' develops in the foetal membrane overlying the cervix due to collage remodelling. This eventually leads to rupture of the fetal membrane and the onset of labour.  Signalling of fetal maturation and parturition  As pregnancy advances to term, the fetal membranes undergo weakening. The amnion is vital in the synthesis of prostaglandins which reach the myometrium and create and initiate parturition. The chorion expresses chemicals that balance synthesis and metabolism of these prostaglandins to ensure that the myometrium is not activated pre-term. Prostaglandin E2 is thought to be synthesized by cells in the amnion and is essential in dilation of the cervix at the initiation of parturition. Glucocorticoids have been implicated in fetal maturation, regulation of immune response and many other pregnancy associated changes. As well as its function in parturition, Prostaglandin E2 is vital for fetal lung maturation. Additionally, there is an abundance of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 expressed in the foetal membranes. This enzyme converts biologically inactive cortisone into active cortisol, another chemical vital for fetal maturation and labour initiation.  Pathophysiology  Preterm births (births taking place before 37 weeks) can be the result of a number of causes such as, in utero infection, inflammation, vascular disease and uterine overdistension. The risk of spontaneous preterm birth is increased by a previous preterm birth, black race, periodontal diseases and low maternal body-mass index. Key indicators of preterm birth are short cervical length and a raised cervical- vaginal fetal fibronectin concentration. Pathophysiology of the fetal membranes, such as microfractures, senescence of cells in the fetal membrane and inflammation can lead to an increased chance of preterm premature rupture of the fetal membranes (pPROM).  Microfractures of the fetal membranes  Throughout gestation the fetal membranes undergo remodelling to allow for the increase in size of the uterus. The remodelling of the fetal membranes occurs at both the level of the cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Structural abnormalities such as areas of where collagen has degraded, known as microfractures, have been observed in the amniotic membrane layer. Microfractures are characterised by: * Alterations to or shedding of the epithelial cells of the amnion layer * Basement membrane damage or degradation * Cells in the ECM migrating * The presence of tunnels from the basement membrane to the spongy layer of the amnion. Microfractures of the fetal membranes are seen in pregnancies where pPROM has occurred. It has been suggested that the presence of more fetal membrane microfractures may mean the fetal membranes may be predisposed for preterm rupture.  Inflammation and senescence of the fetal membranes  Balanced inflammation is an important factor in maintaining fetal membranes by regulating the remodeling. However, if the inflammatory response increases above this level it can have dangerous and potentially fatal effects for the mother and child. These elevated levels of inflammatory molecules in the fetal membrane is called ‘sterile inflammation’. Sterile inflammation can be caused by both microbial infection and non-infectious factors, such as senescence of fetal membranes. Senescence is associated with the aging of actively cycling and dividing cells. As the fetal membrane cells proliferate during remodelling, the telomeres (short length or non-coding DNA on the end of chromosomes that protect essential coding DNA from degradation during replication) shorten as chromosomes can not be copied end-to-end fully. Once the telomeres have reached a critical length the cell can no longer divide and can hence cause telomere-dependent replicative senescence. This should occur naturally at term (37 weeks), as it is an important factor to increase the inflammatory environment in the uterus to initiate parturition. However, fetal membrane senescence can be accelerated by oxidative stress and hence, stimulate sterile inflammation to occur prior to term; consequently, causing preterm birth.

Coming to the island by accident, he supervised construction of several historic churches, some of which survive today. Life John Davis Paris was born on September 22, 1809, in Staunton, Virginia. His father was George Paris and his mother was Mary Hudson. He graduated from Hanover College in Indiana in 1833, and Bangor Theological Seminary in 1839. He married Mary Grant in October 1840, and they had two daughters: Anna Matilda (1843–1917) and Mary Aletta. Mary and John embarked in November 1840, and arrived in Honolulu on May 21, 1841, on the Gloucester, along with the ninth company sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Other members of this company included William Harrison Rice and Daniel Dole and their wives. They and the Rice family had been assigned to the Oregon Territory, but were told that an uprising had wiped out the mission station there, so were advised to stay in Hawaii. The family was assigned to the remote southernmost station at Waiōhinu in the Kaū district of the island of Hawaii. There Paris built the Kauahaao Church (named for a nearby spring). John Davis Paris with his youngest children Mary Paris died in 1847, and John Paris returned to the United States with his two young daughters on the ship Montreal in 1849. In September 1851 Paris married Mary Carpenter (1815–1896) of New York. They decided to return to Hawaii, left in November and arrived in March 1852. This time he was posted to the slightly less remote Kona District on the same island. They had a daughter Ellen (known as Ella) Hudson (1852–1938) and a son John Davis, Jr. (1854–1918). Kona churches A large stone church had been built in 1839 on land donated by Chiefess Kapiolani, in an area known as Kuapehu, inland from the town now known as Nāpoopoo, on the south end of Kealakekua Bay but it had fallen into ruin after six years without a pastor. Paris built a smaller but longer-lasting stone church called Kahikolu on the foundation of the old one. In the Hawaiian language kahikolu was the name for the Holy Trinity. He also rebuilt a house at a cooler, higher elevation which he called Mauna Alani, on Kapiolani's former house site. A cistern and kitchen were completed in 1852, and a two-story house built of wood from mountain forests was finished in 1853. Paris also constructed a kiln to bake coral, which was made into lime mortar. This material would prove to be stronger than the previous materials. The workers trained in these new techniques were applied to more projects in the area. Hale Halawai O Holualoa Paris supervised the construction of a smaller church known as Hale Halawai O Holualoa (\\"the meeting house at Holualoa\\", now known as \\"Living Stones Church\\") completed in 1855 on Holualoa Bay. He also had Helani Church built at Kahaluu Bay in 1861; this church was one of the first to use a native Hawaiian as a pastor. In 1863 he hosted Rufus Anderson from the American board, on a tour of the island's missions. Paris mentioned he was saddened by how the land was being bought up by outsiders. Over his career Paris would be involved in the construction of several more churches, adapting his building materials to suit the location. Churches at higher elevations, such as Central Kona Union, Pukaana Church, and Mauna Ziona in North Kona, were made from wood instead of stone. His last church was Lanakila Church in Kainaliu, started in 1865 and completed in 1867. He is known as one of the most prolific church builders of his time. In 1870 Paris and his wife moved to Honolulu, where he founded the theological department of the North Pacific Institute. In 1874 he retired and moved back to Kona, where his son had become a rancher. He died on July 28, 1892 in the same house, and is buried in the cemetery of the Lanakila Church in Kainaliu. Kaona uprising In 1866, a well-educated native Hawaiian named Joseph Kaona had asked Paris to use the new Lanakila church to store some bibles. At first, Paris welcomed the help. Kaona had grown up in the area, and served in the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii as a district judge and in its House of Representatives in 1853. However, Kaona's erratic behavior alarmed Paris. Kaona claimed he was a prophet sent to warn of the end of the world. He predicted a lava flow would soon destroy everyone except his followers (called Kaonaites) after the earthquakes of April 1868. He had also predicted destruction a few earlier times, but after the appointed day passed, postponed it. Paris learned that Kaona had been sentenced to an asylum a few years earlier after claiming he could raise someone from the dead. Paris tried to lock the Lanakila Church, but the door fell off its hinges and Kaona claimed it was a miracle. When the Kaonaites occupied the church and refused to leave, a local judge ordered it closed and the occupiers evicted. Sheriff R. B. Neville (here in his previous function as fire chief) died in the 1868 uprising Kaona told people to withdraw their children from school and join him in a communal home at the shore. Kaona had his followers chant Psalm 150 for seven days while beating drums made from sugar kegs and tin pots. They wore white robes and flew seven banners because they thought the number seven to be mystical. Although they attempted to pay rent, William F. Roy, the lease- holder of the land asked them to leave. When Sheriff R. B. Neville tried to evict them on October 16, 1868, they refused. Neville had been fire chief of Honolulu, but moved to Kona for what he hoped would be a quieter life. On his second try, on October 19, Kaona's followers clubbed Neville to death. Kamai, a native constable was killed trying to retrieve Neville's body. When word of the uprising reached Honolulu, John Owen Dominis was sent to the site with 200 troops. The Sheriff of Hilo, J. H. Coney, also arrived with about 200 men, and the two groups captured the Kaonaites. At Kaona's trial in May 1869, Albert Francis Judd and David Kalākaua were appointed for the defense, but Kaona used his oratorical skills to defend himself. His charge was reduced to manslaughter and he was sentenced to ten years of hard labor. Kaona was pardoned when Kalākaua became king in 1874; he returned to Kona and died in 1883. Legacy Ella Hudson Paris translated many hymns into the Hawaiian language under the pen name \\"Hualalai\\" (for the nearby volcano Hualālai). The Kahikolu church has held an annual choral event since 1999 called Aha Mele O Hualalai in her honor. Son John Davis II (also known as John Davis Jr.) married Hannah Johnson (1855–1938), the granddaughter of John Davis (nephew of Isaac Davis). Hannah's sister Mary married the wealthy Hilo businessman William Herbert Shipman, whose father had replaced the Paris family at Waiōhinu. The Johnson sisters were daughters of Eliza Johnson Roy (1821–1912), on whose property the Kaona followers were camped. John Jr. served in the Hawaii House of Representatives 1887–1898, and then the territorial Senate 1901–1905. Jack London visited the family in 1907, and mentions a Paris daughter showing the visitors the nearby historic sites. The April 1868 earthquake, estimated to be the largest ever to hit Hawaii destroyed his church in Waiōhinu. Kahikolu Church was damaged on August 21, 1951, by an earthquake centered almost under the church. Kahikolu was abandoned in 1953 as a result of the damage, but reconstructed from 1982 to 1986, and re-opened in 1999. Kauahaao Church was rebuilt (with wood) in 1888, but demolished in April 1998. Victoria Nalani Kneubuhl has written a one-act play titled A Visit to Kalukalu which depicts Ella Hudson Paris visiting a local store in 1888, performed on location by the Kona Historical Society.

Background The Paraphrases of Erasmus, which were composed and published between 1517 and 1523, exerted great influence on English Christianity of the time. It was probably the idea of Catherine Parr, the last wife of Henry VIII of England, to translate these paraphrases into English \\"to guide English Scripture readers into less contentious paths.\\" She assembled a group of translators, and submitted their work and her patronage to Nicholas Udall, who oversaw the editing process and was probably responsible for the translation of the Gospel of Luke. The queen herself may have translated parts of the Gospel of Matthew and Acts of the Apostles, and Mary I of England, a princess at that time, translated the Gospel of John. In his 1547 Injunctions, Edward VI of England ordered that a copy of this work should be placed in every church within a year of its completion in 1547. This raised the commentary by Erasmus on the New Testament to the status of being the authorized commentary by the Church of England under Edward VI of England; the book was \\"forced upon all parish churches in an effort to infuse the English Reformation with even more Erasmian thought.\\" Printing history Edward Whitchurch and Richard Grafton, also the printers of the Great Bible, were given the job of printing the translated Paraphrases. The first printing appeared on the last day of January 1548. While the imprint lists only Whitchurch, Grafton must have been involved as well, as suggested by the typography. Incidentally, Whitchurch and Grafton also published the Injunctions, though earlier they had fallen from royal grace: they had been friends of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex and their fortunes declined with Cromwell's downfall. According to Herbert, William Aldis Wright has noted no less than six variants of the first edition because multiple presses were run to generate enough copies within the short period of a year. Contents The book was dedicated to Catherine Parr. Volume 1 includes the Gospels through Acts; Volume 2 contains the balance of the New Testament with the exception of The Paraphrase on Revelation (omitted by Erasmus), which is by Leo Jud. Herbert gives a table of contents for the copy that he has examined (most Bibles from this period include neither an index or a table of contents). Placement of the contents may vary among copies because different variants of the Bible were produced at the same time. William Aldis Wright found at least 6 variants of this volume were produced by different presses to satisfy the demand. Because they were set by different typesetters, there is no uniform placement of the contents for this Bible first volume of this Bible. Catalog entries In A. S. Herbert's historical catalogue of English Bibles (1968) it is identified as \\"Herbert 72,\\" printed in 2 volumes; according to Herbert, volumes are kept at Bible House England, British Museum, Bodleian Library Oxford, University Library Cambridge, Harvard Library, and the New York Public Library. A second edition appears as \\"Herbert 73,\\" printed in 1551-52, but only Volume 1 appears to be known. Herbert reports that the existent copies have many mutilated pages, and their scarcity is due to the efforts of Mary I of England to restore the (Latin) Vulgate Bible, after she became queen in 1553. In her effort to promote Roman Catholicism she ordered all copies of this book to be destroyed—despite having translated Erasmus' commentary on St. John, for which she is praised in this very book. Volume 2 may never have been printed, given that the timing of its printing would have been at the approximate time of her ascension to the throne. If it does exist, the location of any copies is not documented. References External links Editions *The First tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the newe testamente (1548).

It was invented by Drs. Michael Anshel, Iris Anshel, and Dorian Goldfeld. Unlike other group-based protocols, it does not employ any commuting or commutative subgroups of a given platform group and can use any nonabelian group with efficiently computable normal forms. It is often discussed specifically in application of braid groups, which notably are infinite (and the group elements can take variable quantities of space to represent). The computed shared secret is an element of the group, so in practice this scheme must be accompanied with a sufficiently secure compressive hash function to normalize the group element to a usable bitstring.  Description  Let G be a fixed nonabelian group called a platform group. Alice's public/private information: * Alice's public key is a tuple of elements {\\\\bf a}=(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n) in G. * Alice's private key is a sequence of elements from {\\\\bf a} and their inverses: a_{i_1}^{\\\\varepsilon_1}, \\\\ldots, a_{i_L}^{\\\\varepsilon_L}, where a_{i_k}\\\\in{\\\\bf a} and \\\\varepsilon_k=\\\\pm 1. Based on that sequence she computes the product A = a_{i_1}^{\\\\varepsilon_1} \\\\ldots a_{i_L}^{\\\\varepsilon_L}. Bob's public/private information: * Bob's public key is a tuple of elements {\\\\bf b}=(b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n) in G. * Bob's private key is a sequence of elements from {\\\\bf b} and their inverses: b_{j_1}^{\\\\delta_1}, \\\\ldots, b_{j_L}^{\\\\delta_L}, where b_{j_k}\\\\in{\\\\bf b} and \\\\delta_k=\\\\pm 1. Based on that sequence he computes the product B = b_{j_1}^{\\\\delta_1} \\\\ldots b_{j_L}^{\\\\delta_L}. Transitions: * Alice sends a tuple {\\\\overline{\\\\bf a}}=(A^{-1}b_1A,\\\\ldots,A^{-1}b_nA) to Bob. * Bob sends a tuple {\\\\overline{\\\\bf b}}=(B^{-1}a_1B,\\\\ldots,B^{-1}a_nB) to Alice. Shared key: The key shared by Alice and Bob is the group element K = A^{-1} B^{-1} A B \\\\in G called the commutator of A and B. * Alice computes K as a product A^{-1} \\\\cdot \\\\left(B^{-1}a_{i_1}^{\\\\varepsilon_1}B\\\\right)\\\\cdots \\\\left(B^{-1}a_{i_L}^{\\\\varepsilon_L}B\\\\right) = A^{-1} B^{-1} A B. * Bob computes K as a product \\\\left(A^{-1}b_{i_1}^{\\\\varepsilon_1}A\\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left(A^{-1} b_{i_L}^{\\\\varepsilon_L}A^{}\\\\right) \\\\cdot B . Security From the standpoint of an attacker trying to attack the protocol, they usually learn the public keys \\\\bf a and \\\\bf b, and the conjugated public keys \\\\overline{\\\\bf a} and \\\\overline{\\\\bf b}. A direct attack then consists of trying to find a suitable A that is generated by the elements of \\\\bf a, and that produces the appropriate conjugations \\\\overline{\\\\bf a} when applied. (An 'indirect' attack would consist of trying to find K directly, which would require some additional special structure of the group.) For this reason the public keys \\\\bf a and \\\\bf b must be chosen to generate a large subgroup of G — ideally, they form a full set of generators, so that A cannot be constrained just by knowing that is generated from \\\\bf a. Solving for a suitable A given the conjugation relations is called the conjugation problem, and substantial research has been done on attacks to the conjugacy problem on braid groups, although no full efficient solution has achieved.

It is a remote valley at the northwestern corner of North America's Basin and Range Province. The valley is home to a chain of lakes and wetlands known as the Warner Lakes. Native Americans were present in the Warner Valley for thousands of years before European explorers arrived in the 19th century. It is the site of Fort Warner, built by the United States Army in 1867. The fort was used as a supply depot and administrative headquarters during a protracted Army campaign against Northern Paiute bands in eastern Oregon and northern California. Today, livestock ranching is the main commercial activity in the valley. The Warner Valley offers a number of recreational opportunities including hunting, fishing, bird watching, and wildlife viewing.  Geography  The Warner Valley is located in south-central Oregon. It is approximately long and wide. Most of the valley is in Lake County; however, the north end of the valley extends about into Harney County. The valley has two regions commonly referred to as the South Warner Valley and the North Warner Valley. The two areas transition between Crump Lake and Hart Lake at a point where the valley narrows to about in width.Whistler, John T. and John H. Lewis, \\"Location and General Conditions\\", Warner Valley and White River Projects, United States Reclamation Service, United States Department of Interior in cooperation with the State of Oregon, Washington D.C., February 1916, pp. 16–19. Both sides of the South Warner Valley have steep cliffs rising from above the valley floor. The eastern cliffs run the entire length of the valley, while the western wall turns into rolling hills at the north end of the valley. The Coyote Hills are the western boundary through the middle of the North Warner Valley, with the Rabbit Hills bounding the northwest corner of the valley. From the hills, the ground slopes up to the crest of Abert Rim. The eastern boundary of the valley is Hart Mountain, a massive cliff face that rises above the valley floor. Warner Peak is the highest point on Hart Mountain. The summit is above sea level.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Hart Mountain\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 449.Gottberg, John Anderson, \\"Pronghorn Paradise\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 16 August 2009.Jackman, E.R. and R.A. Long,The Oregon Desert, Canton Press, Caldwell, Idaho: 1964, p. 361. The valley floor is occupied by a chain of lakes known collectively as the Warner Lakes. The entire valley was once covered by a single vast lake; however, the water level gradually receded, leaving a chain of lakes at the low spots with marshland between the lakes. Starting at the south end of the valley, the largest of the Warner Lakes are Pelican Lake, Crump Lake, Hart Lake, Anderson Lake, Swamp Lake, Mugwump Lake, Flagstaff Lake, Upper Campbell Lake, Lower Campbell Lake, Stone Corral Lake, Turpin Lake, and Bluejoint Lake. Because the valley slopes away to the north, Crump Lake is higher in elevation than Bluejoint Lake.McArthur, pp. 1010–1011.  Geology  The country to the north and east of the Warner Valley is a high volcanic plateau which has undergone considerable erosion. The Warner Valley was probably a similar high plateau before massive faulting dropped the valley floor and uplifted the land around it, forming high valley walls. The Warner Lakes formed in the valley bottom after the faulting stopped.Whistler, John T. and John H. Lewis, \\"Geology\\", Warner Valley and White River Projects, United States Reclamation Service, United States Department of Interior in cooperation with the State of Oregon, Washington D.C., February 1916, p. 21.\\"Warner Wetlands Area of Critical Environmental Concern\\" (PDF), Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, 26 August 2005. The Warner Valley is bounded by high escarpment walls on the east and west. The main line of perpendicular displacement is along the foot of the cliffs to the east of the Warner Lakes. This scarp feature is known as Hart Mountain. The main cliff face of Hart Mountain towers above the valley floor. It runs the length of the valley, eventually being lost in a series of smaller fault scarps at the north end of the valley. These smaller scarps generally run from the east side of the valley to the northwest. The south end of the valley is more complex. In that area, the valley floor is bounded on three sides by perpendicular cliffs from high, the result of numerous fault events. These cliffs expose hundreds of feet of Miocene and Oligocene lava flows and ignimbrites, which include Steens basalt and various andesite, trachyandesite, and tuff flows. The mountain mass forming the western border of the South Warner Valley is a steep fault scarp. This cliff face rises over above the valley floor.Dooley, Michelle May, \\"Geologic Mapping and Petrochemical Stratigraphy of Southern Warner Valley, Southern Oregon, USA\\" (PDF), Department of Geological Sciences, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, 2008. Warner Valley is an alluvial basin containing numerous lakes, remnants of a single great lake that covered the valley floor up to a depth of during the Pleistocene epoch. Today, steep cliffs rise above a chain of endorheic lakes.  Climate  The climate in the Warner Valley is typical of the high desert country of south-central Oregon. However, the high escarpments forming the western wall of the South Warner Valley tend to protect the southern part of the valley from the prevailing westerly winds. The absence of a high rim along much of the North Warner Valley increases the harshness of the fall and winter seasons at the north end of the valley.Whistler, John T. and John H. Lewis, \\"Climate\\", Warner Valley and White River Projects, United States Reclamation Service, United States Department of Interior in cooperation with the State of Oregon, Washington D.C., February 1916, p. 20. Air movements brought about by the uneven temperatures in the valley and on the surrounding higher plateaus and mountains give rise to local winds. These winds are strongest at places where canyons, such as Deep Creek Canyon, open into the valley. In the Warner Valley, frost is common until late spring and begins again in early fall. As a result, the growing season in the valley is limited to about 100 days. The Warner Valley gets most of its rain in May and June, while the summer and fall months tend to be very dry. The winter snowfall in the valley bottom is generally very light; however, winter temperatures can get very cold. The higher plateau country above the valley usually gets several feet of snow and the higher peaks can get much more. In most years, the high peaks have snow on them from early fall until mid-summer. This snowpack feeds the streams that drain into the valley.  Ecology  Warner Wetlands Interpretive Site The Warner Valley provides a number of unique animal habitats. These include lake, marsh, riparian, grasslands, sage steppe, dry forest, and rimrock. They range in elevation from approximately above sea level at the valley floor to over at the summit of Warner Peak. Marsh grasses are common along the lake shores. In the riparian areas, wild roses, choke cherry, wild plum, cottonwood, and willow are found. Beyond the wetlands, the valley becomes quite dry. Much of the North Warner Valley is semi-desert, where dwarf sagebrush, greasewood, and Western Juniper are the dominant vegetation.Rakestraw, John, \\"Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge and the Warner Valley\\", Morris Book Publishing, Kearney, Nebraska, 2007, pp. 20–22. The valley’s wildlife includes common high desert mammal species, resident birds, and migrant waterfowl. There are forty- two mammal species that live in the Warner Valley-Hart Mountain area. These include pronghorn, bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, cougar, bobcat, and coyotes. Smaller mammals include jackrabbits, ground squirrels, and chipmunks. There are 239 species of birds that live in the area or migrate through the Warner Valley. Species that nest in the areas around Crump Lake and Hart Lake include American white pelicans, double-crested cormorants, willets, Wilson's phalaropes, Canada geese, gadwalls, northern shovelers, black-crowned night herons, and numerous varieties of ducks and terns. In addition, sandhill cranes, white-faced ibis, great white egrets, and American avocets are found in the marshes and along the lake shores. At the Warner Wetlands Area of Critical Environmental Concern, administered by the Bureau of Land Management, there are observation blinds where American bitterns, black-necked stilts, cinnamon teal, tundra swans, Brewer's blackbirds, western meadowlarks, swallows, and nighthawks are commonly seen. In the valley’s riparian areas, dusky flycatchers, yellow warblers, orange-crowned warblers, house wrens, and spotted towhees are common in the summer months. In the sage steppes and grasslands, summer residents include horned larks, Brewer's sparrows, vesper sparrows, common ravens, sage thrashers, sagebrush sparrows, black-throated sparrows, and greater sage grouse. In the rimrock areas, there are chukars, rock wrens, canyon wrens, cliff swallows, and barn swallows. The valley also hosts mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, black-headed grosbeaks, green- tailed towhees, yellow-rumped warblers, MacGillivray's warblers, mountain bluebirds, white-headed woodpeckers, and flammulated owls. The larger birds include great horned owls, long-eared owls, prairie falcons, golden eagles, and bald eagles.\\"Warner Wetlands\\", Welcome to Lake County, Oregon’s Outback, OregonsOutback.com, Lakeview, Oregon, 12 October 2009.  History  Native Americans used the Warner Valley for thousands of years before the first Europeans arrived. The valley has scores of petroglyphs, some estimated to be 12,000 years old. The Greaser Petroglyph Site, in the South Warner Valley, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Cultural Resources\\" (PDF), Summary of the Analysis of the Management Situation for the Lakeview Resource Area – Resource Management Plan, Lakeview Field Office, Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United State Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, July 2000, pp. 2.28–29.\\"Greaser Petroglyph, OR\\", Waymarking (posted by Volcanoguy), Groundspeak Inc., www.waymarking.com, 16 October 2007.\\"Greaser Petroglyph Site\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 19 January 2009. The first European explorer to enter the valley was probably John Work, who headed a Hudson's Bay Company trapping expedition in 1832. While it is not certain that he visited the valley, he was in the area and left a description of a \\"valley of lakes\\" that correspond closely to the Warner Valley. The next explorer to arrive in the valley was Captain John C. Fremont, who led a party through the valley in December 1843. Fremont named it Christmas Valley since his party spent Christmas Day camped near Hart Lake. However, early mapmakers mistakenly sited Christmas Valley at another location northwest of the Warner Valley, leaving the valley unnamed on an early map. In 1849, the valley was explored by Captain William H. Warner, an Army topographical engineer. On 26 September 1849, Warner was ambushed and killed by Indians just south of the Warner Valley. In 1864, Lieutenant Colonel C. S. Drew of the 1st Oregon Cavalry visited the valley while on a long-range reconnaissance patrol. Drew named the valley in honor of Warner, who he believed had been killed there. Oregon Central Military Wagon Road In 1865, the Army decided it needed a fort in the Warner Valley to facilitate the interdiction of Indian raiding parties passing through the area. Army scouts selected a site along Honey Creek on the west side of the Warner Lakes. In 1866, a detachment from Fort Boise was sent to establish the fort. The soldiers arrived on the east side of the lakes in late summer. Unable to cross the chain of lakes and marshes, the soldiers built a winter camp on the east side of the lakes. The camp was sited poorly and the men had a very difficult winter. In February 1867, General George Crook visited the Warner Valley outpost. Crook directed that the camp be moved to the Honey Creek site west of the lakes. To get the Army’s wagons across the wetlands, Crook ordered the construction of a bridge across the narrow channel between Hart Lake and Crump Lake. Shortly after the bridge was begun a second detachment was sent ahead to build the new fort. The Stone Bridge was completed that summer and the soldiers moved into the new camp, which was named Fort Warner. By 1869, the Indian raids in south-central Oregon had ended and a treaty had been signed. With no Indian raiders left in the area, Fort Warner was abandoned in 1874.\\"Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory – Nomination Form, National Register of Historic Places, United States Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 13 August 1974.McArthur, p. 916.Bach, Melva M., \\"Camp Warner Moved to Honey Creek – 1867\\" (PDF), History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, p. 14. While nothing remains of Fort Warner, the Stone Bridge the Army built to cross the Warner wetlands still exists. The bridge is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 24 September 2009. In 1865, the United States Congress authorized the construction of the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road from Eugene, Oregon, to Fort Boise in Idaho. Congress allowed the construction company to claim three sections of land for every mile of road built. As a result, road surveyors laid out a route designed to pass through as much well-watered, desirable land as possible. The route of the military road came through the Warner Valley, crossing over the Warner Lakes at the Stone Bridge before passing south of Hart Mountain through what is today the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge and heading east.\\"Oregon Central Military Road\\", Oregon State Office, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 17 September 2009.\\"Oregon History: Uncle Sam's Handiwork\\", Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 17 September 2009.\\"Unblushing Land Frauds; The President Sends Information to Congress How Big Chunks of the Public Domain Have Been Stolen by Wagon Road Companies in Oregon\\", New York Times, New York, New York, 21 March 1888. In reality, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road was a venture designed to acquire public lands at little or no cost to the road company’s investors. Nevertheless, the construction company was able to secure thousands of acres of valuable grazing land in the Warner Valley. Legal disputes kept the ownership of these lands in question for decades, preventing settlers from claiming land grants for farms and ranches. Ownership was finally decided by the United States Supreme Court in a case known as the United States versus the California and Oregon Land Company.\\"United States v. California & Oregon Land Co., 148 U.S. 31 (1893)\\", United States Supreme Court decision, Washington, D.C., decided 6 March 1893. Eventually, the land passed into the hands of the Oregon Valley Land Company, which subdivided it into lots and parcels. The property was sold in a nationally advertised auction held in Lakeview, Oregon in 1909.Richard Engeman, Oregon Historical Society, \\"Lake County Court House\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2005. Settlement did not occur in the Warner Valley until the latter part of the 19th century. For example, the land occupied by Fort Warner was homesteaded by John H. Dent in 1889.McArthur, p. 279. The Plush, Oregon post office was opened on 18 July 1888. Its first postmaster was David R. Jones.McArthur, p. 791. The Adel post office was opened in 1896.McArthur, p. 8.  Human activity  Hay stacks in fields south of Adel Today, agriculture is the primary source of income in the Warner Valley. Most of the private land in the valley is used for cattle ranching. Crops are generally used for winter feed. Because of the short growing season, the valley’s principal crops are wild hay, alfalfa, clover, and timothy-grass. Grains such as wheat, oats, rye, and barley can also be grown in the Warner Valley. Three crops of alfalfa per season can be raised over much of the South Warner Valley, while the less favorable climate in the North Warner Valley makes one or two crops the norm. Much of the valley is public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. These public lands offer numerous recreational opportunities including hunting, fishing, bird watching, wildlife viewing, boating, and camping. However, some of these activities are dependent on the water level of the Warner Lakes, which can fluctuate dramatically. Crappie, smallmouth bass, and bullhead catfish are common in the lakes while trout including Great Basin redband trout are found in Twentymile Creek, Deep Creek, and Honey Creek. There are no developed campgrounds in the valley; however, dispersed camping is allowed on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. There are public restrooms, sheltered picnic tables, and hiking trails at the Bureau of Land Management's Warner Wetlands Interpretive Site at Hart Bar.\\"Warner Wetlands\\", Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 12 October 2009.

Baseball career Minor leagues Taylor was born in Alhambra, California. He threw and batted left-handed and was listed as tall and . He signed with the Pacific Coast League's Oakland Oaks in 1947 and was acquired by the Giants during the 1950 minor league baseball season. He spent most of 1953 with the Giants' Double-A minor league affiliate, the Nashville Volunteers. After posting a .350 batting average with 22 home runs in 107 games for Nashville, he was promoted to the Giants' Triple-A farm club, the Minneapolis Millers. He played 47 games for the Millers, batting .223 with seven home runs. In Major League Baseball Taylor made his Major League debut for the Giants on April 14, 1954, pinch hitting for Mario Picone and striking out against Brooklyn Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe. He spent the entire 1954 season with the National League champion Giants, appearing in 55 games and getting 12 hits in 65 at bats for a .185 batting average. He also hit two home runs, had ten runs batted in and scored four runs. He played nine games in the field without an error, seven in left field as Hall of Famer Monte Irvin's backup, and two in right field backing up Don Mueller. Although the Giants won the 1954 World Series in four games that season, Taylor did not see any playing time in the Fall Classic. Taylor again spent the entire season with the Giants in . He played in 65 games and had 17 hits in 64 at-bats for a .266 batting average, while hitting four home runs and a .516 slugging percentage. He played just two games in the field, both in right field. In , he played most of the season back in the minors with the Millers, but did appear in one game for the Giants, getting a double in four at-bats. In , he again played most of the season with the Millers, and went hitless in 11 games and nine at bats for the Giants. On September 14, he was sold to the Detroit Tigers, and played in nine games for the Tigers. The 1958 campaign was Taylor's final season in the Major Leagues. He played in eight early-season games, all but one as a pinch hitter, and getting three hits in 8 at bats for a .375 batting average. After rosters were cut from 28 to 25 men in May, he spent most of 1958 with the Tigers' top affiliate, the Charleston Senators. He started 1959 with Charleston, but moved to the Buffalo Bisons in the Philadelphia Phillies' organization in midseason. He also played for the Bisons in 1960 and 1961. In his Major League career, Taylor played 149 games over five seasons and had 41 hits in 173 at-bats for a .237 batting average. He hit 7 home runs, and 26 runs batted in and 17 runs scored, a .264 on-base percentage and a .405 slugging percentage. Of his 149 Major League games, he only played in the field in 18, all in the outfield. As a fielder, he made 13 putouts with no assists and no errors, for a career fielding percentage of 1.000. He also played in 1261 minor league games between 1947 and 1961, with a .311 batting average and 186 home runs. Winjter leagues Taylor also played for the Navegantes del Magallanes and Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League.

It concerned a dispute between Telstra Corporation Ltd and the Commonwealth of Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and eleven other ISPs regarding the ownership of and shared access obligations to the Telstra controlled unconditional local loop (ULL) copper telecommunications network. The case determined that although Telstra owned and maintained this network, its ownership over these assets were always subject to a statutory access regime permitting other carriers rightful access these assets.ACCC Media Release 6 March 2008. Retrieved 5 September 2009 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. It is an important case in Australia constitutional law in that it explored the interpretation of the nature of property and acquisition. More importantly, the ruling had a resounding effect on competition and consumer protection within the Australian telecommunications industry by upholding the right to fair competition of competing carriers, thus preventing a monopoly control of Internet and telephony services by Telstra.  Background to the case  From the 1880s Australia had developed an extensive public switched telephone network (PSTN), copper infrastructure which is widely dispersed throughout the country and immediately evident in most business and residential premises as the standard telephone network. This infrastructure is distributed nationwide by telephone exchanges, from which it locally extends into customer premises. The physical copper connection between the customer premises and the telephone exchange is known as a \\"local loop\\". There are about 10.1 million local loops and about 5,120 local exchanges. Local loops can carry services in two ways, unconditioned and shared. Unconditioned local loop services (ULLS) are \\"unconditioned\\" in that the electrical properties of the loop are not altered by any physically connected equipment. Local sharing services (LSS) are unconditioned local loops where one carrier uses the lower frequencies range of the line, known as the \\"voiceband\\" used in regular telephony, whilst that same carrier or another uses the higher frequency range of that same line for high speed services such as ADSL internet. Prior to Federation, the PSTN infrastructure that then existed was owned and maintained by the colonial governments. The Constitution provided for the transfer of the network to the Commonwealth of Australia, who operated the network through the Postmaster-General's Department. In July 1975, the assets constituting the PSTN were transferred to a body then called the Australian Telecommunications Commission, later changed to the Australian Telecommunications Corporation, created under the Telecommunications Act 1975 and began trading as a monopoly under the name Telecom Australia. In a Parliamentary move to invite competition, Telstra Corporation Limited, then known as the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, was incorporated under the Corporations Law of ACT in November 1991, as a company limited by shares, the sole shareholder being the Australian Commonwealth. The PSTN was then vested in Telstra, as of 1 February 1992, in accordance with the Telecommunications Act 1991 of which one of the stated objects is \\"creating a regulatory environment for the supply of telecommunications services which promotes competition and fair and efficient market conduct\\". Once privatised, Telstra operation became subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974 which requires that competitors be given access to the PSTN and related services, and empowered The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to make determinations about the terms and conditions of access obligations and the pricing principles applicable to services relating to the PSTN, and in this case ULLS and LSS. It was this enforced pricing model that Telstra rejected, claiming they are forced to provide wholesale access to competitors at below cost price, which they believed amounted to an acquisition of property other than on just terms contrary to Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Thus, Telstra began proceedings in the High Court of Australia against the Commonwealth, the ACCC, and eleven of its competitors, seeking adequate compensation and the ability to charge its competitors more for access. The eleven competitors involved were internet service providers Primus Telecommunications, Optus Networks, Chime Communications, XYZED, Powertel Limited, Request Broadband, NEC Australia, Macquarie Telecom, AMCOM, Adam Internet, and Agile.  The Telecommunications Access Regime  The PSTN was vested in Telstra, with effect from 1 February 1992, under the Telecommunications Act 1991 which commenced on 1 July 1991. This meant that all of its provisions had commenced prior to the PSTN actually being vested in Telstra. This legislation limited a former monopoly control over the telecommunications industry by promoting the fair competition subject to the Australian Telecommunications Access Regime set out in Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act. This regime applies to telecommunications services which, following a public inquiry, are declared by the ACCC as \\"declared services\\". Section 152AL(3) of the TPA provides for the declaration of these services subject to Part XIC.. Once a service becomes a declared service the service provider that provides that service must then adhere to the standard access obligations as described in Section 152AR..Lindsay, D 2008, 'Does regulating telecommunications interconnection amount to compulsory acquisition of property?', Telecommunications Journal of Australia, Vol.58, No.1, May 2008. Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act was inserted in that Act by the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Act 1997.  Argument  Telstra rejected the regulation of ULLS and LSS under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, alleging that the wholesale access price caps imposed on it by the ACCC do not allow it to recover the operating costs of the actual service being accessed and retailed by a competitor, alleging that this amounted to a compulsory acquisition of Telstra property by the Commonwealth, and access- seeking competitors, on unjust terms contrary to section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution states that the Parliament has legislative power to create laws relating to: > the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any > purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws..  Impugned provisions  The argument made on Telstra's behalf focused directly on Sections 152AL(3) and 152AR of the Trade Practices Act, and asked whether these two Sections, in their applications to ULL and LSS, were beyond the legislative powers of parliament by way of Section 51(xxxi). Therefore, rejecting the validity of Sections 152AL(3) and 152AR which it claimed affect an unconstitutional acquisition of Telstra property by the Commonwealth on unjust terms. As mentioned earlier these two Sections provide for the declaration of services by the ACCC and impose standard access obligations, terms and conditions which include the monetary price bracket limiting what Telstra is allowed to charge its competitors for access to declared services. If then, as Telstra continued to argue, terms and conditions may be fixed for its compliance with standard access obligations in respect to local loops, ULL and LSS, which are terms that differ from those that would be fixed in arm's length (all parties being independent and equal) bargaining between it and the access seeker, the provisions that lead to that result provide for an acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms.  Section 152EB  Telstra submitted that this conclusion is not denied by the provisions of Section 152EB which deal expressly with the subject of just terms. If a Commonwealth law provides for the acquisition of property on unjust terms, then Section 51(xxxi) renders that law invalid, since it is beyond the legislative powers of the Commonwealth to create such a law, then Section 152EB, the final provision of Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, acts to save that law from invalidity, via reasonable compensation by the Commonwealth.. Telstra argued that this provision did not save the impugned provisions from invalidity stating that relevant acquisitions \\"occur by the imposition of the standard access obligations on carriers or providers pursuant to Section 152AR\\" and not by any ACCC determination. Furthermore, any acquisition only comes into operation when a relevant request for the service is made by a provider, and not by any ACCC determination. Telstra stated that Section 152EB should be considered engaged only in respect to determinations that effect an acquisition, and that the only relevant determinations are those made by the ACCC. Thus, Telstra argued, this provision did not apply to any acquisition effected by Section 152AR since the relevant acquisition is effected by the provider's request for access engaging the standard obligations under Section 152AR, and not by any determination made by the ACCC. The High Court rejected Telstra's interpretation of Section 152EB by stating that the said provision refers to determinations that would \\"result in\\" an acquisition of property on unjust terms, and not to determinations that would \\"effect\\" such an acquisition. The High Court also pointed to the fact that Telstra's argument involves a dispute about the terms and conditions of complying with the service access obligations fixed by ACCC determinations, thus enabling the operation of Section 152EB. As a result of the High Court's position, Telstra next suggested that the impugned provisions do effect an acquisition of property, and just terms must then be afforded by the operation of Section 152EB, removing any claim of invalidity so long as the Commonwealth pays reasonable compensation. At this stage the High Court found it important to consider the nature of the \\"acquisition of property\\".  Acquisition of property?  In Australian courts Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution focuses on matters of substance rather than form, and therefore the definitions of \\"acquisition\\" and \\"property\\" are to be interpreted liberally. In the case of Yanner v Eaton.. it was mentioned that the word \\"property\\" is often used to refer to something that belongs to another, though in law, \\"property\\" does not refer to a thing; it is a description of a legal relationship with a thing. It refers to a degree of power that is recognised in law as power permissibly exercised over the thing. The concept of \\"property\\" may be elusive. Usually it is treated as a \\"bundle of rights\\". In this same case it was also accepted that \\"an extensive frame of reference is created by the notion that “property” consists primarily in control over access. Much of our false thinking about property stems from the residual perception that “property” is itself a thing or resource rather than a legally endorsed concentration of power over things and resources.\\" Such considerations were vital to the matter concerning Telstra, as they submitted that the physical disconnection of the local loop from its equipment and its physical connection to another carrier’s equipment constituted an acquisition of property. Due to these physical acts, Telstra claimed it lost \\"control of and the ability to use the infrastructure\\" which it \\"owned\\". The competing carriers, listed as defending parties, chose to shift the argument from the physical steps in connecting and disconnecting ULL and LLS to that of whether there had ever been any actual \\"possession\\" on their part, since Telstra installs, repairs, and maintain the network at all times. All connections and disconnections of ULL and LLS are carried out by Telstra, regardless of whether those services relate to its own customers or customers of competing carriers. These same defendants pointed to the fact that end-users, the customers, can and do chose which service provider connects equipment to the local loops entering their premises, and as long as that choice is not Telstra, then Telstra have no use for that local loop. The defendant's arguments sought to invoke certain elements of the long line of cases in the Australian High Court in which Section 51(xxxi) has been considered. In addressing these arguments the Court decided that rather than begin from the classification of rule and its exceptions, it would instead recognise observations made by Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Act Case): > \\"It is well established that the guarantee effected by s 51(xxxi) of the > Constitution extends to protect against the acquisition, other than on just > terms, of “every species of valuable right and interest including ... choses > in action”. It has been held to prohibit the extinguishment of vested causes > of action. At least that is so if the extinguishment results “in a direct > benefit or financial gain ... and the cause of action is one that arises > under the general law”..\\"  Judgment  The High Court held that there were three key factors on the history of the Australian communications industry that led to the conclusion that operation of the access regime did not result in an acquisition of property on unjust terms. Firstly the PSTN (including the local loops in dispute) which Telstra now \\"owns\\" was originally owned by the Commonwealth itself. Secondly, prior to the vesting of the PSTN (and local loops) in Telstra's predecessor, the Telecommunications Act 1991 had commenced on 1 July 1991, establishing the access regime that gave competitors the rights to interconnect to the PSTN and to obtain access to services it supplies. Thirdly, at the time the PSTN was vested in Telstra, Telstra was wholly owned by the Commonwealth. And so it was maintained that when the PSTN was transferred from the Commonwealth to Telstra's predecessor, Telstra's right over the network were always subject to the access rights of its competitors to its network and services. Thus, the High Court unanimously dismissed Telstra's case holding that Sections 152AL(3) and 152AR of the Trade Practices Act were not invalid and that Telstra never actually owned any of the assets that comprise the PSTN except under and in accordance with the legislative provisions for \\"promoting ... competition in the telecommunications industry generally and among carriers\\". Furthermore, it was stated that Telstra's argument was \\"synthetic and unreal\\" because it was based on an assumption that Telstra has greater rights over the PSTN than it actually has.  Consequences  In a media release on its website, dated 8 March 2008, Telstra announced that it accepted the High Court's ruling and stood by its decision to challenge the ACCC's powers under Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, though believes Australia lost an opportunity for further broadband investment when the regulatory regime that rewards competitors who \\"ride on Telstra’s network rather than invest in Australia\\" was upheld.Media Release 6 March 2008 Telstra Corporation. Other commentators believed this outcome to be a clear rebuttal to Telstra's \\"obsession with privatisation for its own sake\\" and protection of its remaining monopoly under the direction of CEO at the time Sol Trujillo, a United States telecommunications executive with a history of aggressive litigation towards the US government and its regulators, who was hired by the Telstra board for his ability to uphold a \\"culture of litigating in order to protect its monopoly privileges\\".Howard's crossed line on Telstra Gittens, R 2006 The Sydney Morning Herald 30 August 2006. Had such privileges as those relating to ULL and SSL been upheld, Telstra would be able to charge monopoly- inflated prices for access to its network, thus reducing competition and increasing consumer access fees. Exploitation of such monopoly control would result in increased access costs for competitors, their private and business customers, and eventually, all Australian online services.Telstra Broadband Price Hike Plan Revealed – Consumers Deserve the Full Story 15 February 2007 Competitive Carrier's Coalition.

After Trujillo's resignation from Telstra in February 2009, new CEO David Thodey reached out to the Australian Government and regulators such as the ACCC in an effort to repair the relationships damaged during his predecessor's reign.

Its plot is set in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa, Israel. Plot The film contains five story lines, each of which is presented in a non-chronological fashion. Some events are shown multiple times from varying perspectives. A young Israeli Arab boy, Nasri, who lives in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa, narrates the film. In the first story, Nasri's neighbor—a teenage boy—is shot to death by a well-known Bedouin clan in a drive-by shooting while working on his car. Nasri explains that the intended target was his older brother Omar, who had previously sold the car to the neighbor. The botched hit was revenge for a loss of one of Bedouin clan members, who was shot and paralyzed by Nasri's uncle in a dispute. Nasri and his younger sister are sent to Jerusalem, while Omar, his mother, and grandfather stay behind. Fearing for his family's safety, Omar seeks protection and guidance from Abu Elias, an affluent restaurant owner, and well known and respected member of the Jaffa community. Abu Elias arranges for a three-day ceasefire, and hires a lawyer to represent Omar in tribal court. During this time, Nasri and his sister return home. At the conclusion of the court session, the judge declares that Omar must pay tens of thousands of dinars—the equivalent of tens of thousands of US dollars—so peace can be restored. Omar is given three weeks to make good on his payment. Omar and his friend Shaata attempt petty crime in order to come up with the finances, but are unsuccessful at bringing in enough money. Omar's mother attempts to persuade him to escape with the family, but Omar refuses to leave, believing that there is no place to run to. The second story introduces a young teenaged boy named Malek who lives in the Palestinian territory of Nablus. Malek is illegally employed in Abu Elias's restaurant, and works out of desperation to make enough money for his ailing mother's bone marrow transplant surgery. Malek is friends with Omar, who has also become a recent employee at the restaurant. It is also revealed that Omar, a Muslim, is in love with Abu Elias's daughter Hadir, a Christian. Abu Elias, once discovering the secret couple later in the film by catching them in the surreptitious act of flirtation, does not approve of their relationship, and angrily fires Omar, warning him to stay away from his daughter. The third story shows a brief, but violent encounter between an older Jewish man and his three young drug dealing Arab neighbors. The dispute begins when the Jewish man complains to the young men that he has not been able to sleep, due to the fact that their bleating sheep keep him up all night. The disagreement soon escalates, and one of the young men mortally stabs the Jewish man. The three young men go into hiding before the police arrive. Amongst the policemen who arrive at the scene is an Israeli officer named Dan, nicknamed Dando by his friends. Viewers learn that Dando's younger brother Yoni has gone missing during his service in the Israeli Defense Forces. While rumors circulate that Yoni may have run away and became very religious, Dando's family—mother and father specifically—suspect that he may have been kidnapped or murdered by a Palestinian terrorist organization. Dando—a family man with a wife and kids—has remained strong for his emotionally broken family, as they make attempts at locating his brother. Later in the story, Dando is informed that the army has discovered the remains of what is believed to be a murdered Israeli soldier in the Palestinian territories. It is soon thereafter confirmed that the remains are Yoni's, and Dando—emotionally traumatized—vows to find the murderer and bring him to justice. In the fourth story, viewers learn of the character Binj (who is played by co-director Scandar Copti) an eccentric cook who works in Abu Elias's restaurant. He is also close friends with Omar, Shaata and Malek. Binj is in love with a Jewish girl from Tel Aviv, and is thinking of moving in with her, much to the dismay of his group of friends. It is revealed that Binj's brother was one of the three involved in the stabbing of the Jewish man in Jaffa. Both Binj and his father are taken in and interrogated by the police. After his release, Binj reluctantly agrees to accept a great deal of drugs that belongs to his brother who is still on the run. Early one morning, after a social gathering in his house, Binj awakes Malek so he won't be late to the restaurant's opening and hides in his presence the brick of drugs. Just when Malek is leaving he sees three Hebrew speaking men enter Binj's house. When Binj is found dead in his apartment not long afterward, Malek and Omar initially suspect that he was murdered by a group of Israeli drug dealers. It is later revealed that those three men were actually policemen who came to search Binj's house and intimidate him into revealing his brother's location. Having to leave after he told them nothing the police promises Binj to return. Binj, tired from the situation and annoyed by the ongoing harresment of the police, discarded the majority of the drugs, put sugar powder inside packages mimicking drug bricks and hid them around the house in an attempt to mock the police, should they ever return. Binj then proceeds to snort the remainder of drugs he did not discard and accidentally dies of a drug overdose. All of this is unbeknownst to Malek and Omar who, after Binj's death, takes one of the hidden mock-drug packages and, thinking it is the drugs, decides to sell it to a drug dealer in an attempt to pay off their respective debts. Abu Elias learns of their plans and tips off the police, thinking Omar will be caught, thus ending the relationship between Omar and his daughter. Initially, Abu Elias fires Malek after learning of his involvement with drugs, but after Malek's pleading and after learning that Omar will not go alone to the exchange he changes his mind, and instructs Malek to meet the dealers with Omar, but warns him not to carry the drugs on his person. He assures Malek that once Omar is taken into custody by the police, Malek can return to the restaurant and that his sick mother will be taken care of. Like Omar and Malek however, Abu Elias does not realize that the drugs are fake. The fifth story shows the encounter between Omar, Malek, and the drug dealers. Toward the beginning of the film, viewers are shown the scene, and initially led to believe that Malek was shot to death by the drug dealers, once they discovered the drugs were fake. It is revealed later however, that the dealers were actually policemen executing a sting operation. It is also revealed that Omar's younger brother Nasri insisted on accompanying Omar and Malek to the meeting, afraid that something bad would happen to his brother. Upon arrival, Omar tells Nasri to stay in the car, and at Malek's urging, leaves his gun behind as well. At the meeting, the police tackle and beat Omar and Malek after they discover the drugs are fake. Dando, who is a part of the sting, sees Malek with the pocket watch he planned to give Abu Elias as a present. Dando believes that the watch belonged to Yoni and in a fit of rage beats Malek and aims his gun at him with the intent to murder him. However Nasri, who hadn't stayed in the car as ordered, sees the gun pointed at Malek, and shoots Dando with Omar's gun. Malek is then shot and killed by another officer. The film ends with Omar escaping down an alleyway and getting back to the car, only to discover that Nasri is missing.

They were due to replace the Swift-class patrol boats P23 and P24 which had been in commission since 1971 and the Bremse-class patrol boat P32 which had been in commission since 1992. The new vessels were built to Maltese specifications and were partly financed by the EU. The first two vessels were launched in October 2009. All four vessels were delivered to Malta in late 2009, and were officially commissioned on 18 March 2010. The vessels are armed with machine guns and they mount a firefighting water cannon on the aft fly bridge. They are mainly used for search and rescue purposes, border patrol and to rescue illegal immigrants.

The woman was found hiding in a cave after she swam there she was surrounded by jellyfish. The patrol boat also regularly takes part in rescuing illegal immigrants, such as the rescue of 11 migrants in September 2012 along with the patrol boats P22 and P32. P21 also responded to the attempted hijacking of a tanker by migrants on 28 March 2019. On 25 May 2019, P21 assisted the P52 with the rescue of 216 migrants after distress calls where received from 2 rubber dinghies during the night.

P21 responded to a group of migrants that required rescuing. The vessel firstly disembarked 63 of the migrants and then went back to rescue a further 61 migrants that couldn’t fit on the vessel. In total the vessel rescued 124 migrants. On the day P52 and P61 were also involved in further rescue operations that resulted in the navy rescuing 370 migrants in total.

The NGO vessel was due to enter the port of Lampedusa however the Italian authorities refused to provide a safe port. The Maltese government then allowed the 40 migrants to be brought to Malta, only after finalizing a deal with the EU which will take all the 40 migrants. None will remain in Malta.https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/alan-kurdi-migrants-expected-to-go-to- germany-following-their-arrival-in-malta/ P24 In July 2012, the Austal- class P24 towed its predecessor, the decommissioned Swift-class P24 (formerly known as C24), from the AFM base at Haywharf in Floriana to the Malta Freeport in a handover ceremony. From here the decommissioned Swift boat was taken to San Diego where it was restored and placed in the Maritime Museum of San Diego. In November 2012 P24 collided with a small boat in Marsamxett Harbour. The small boat sank but the man on board jumped and was picked up unhurt by the crew of the patrol boat. The boat was then lifted with slight damage and an inquiry was held.

It is also a small port to accept small cargo ships to carry the cement to other placed to be processed. It is located in the southernmost tip of the , peninsula in Istria County in Croatia. It is nestled between and on the Gulf of Quarnero in the Adriatic Sea. It is one of the newest hamlet not even 100 years old. It is located about 15 km from / , 1 km from , 3 km from . Koromačno, was named after a local wild plant, , or fennel, which grows wild all along the coastal area. In the 1800s it shows on the map as \\"Valle Coromaschizza di St. Giovanni\\". In the 1800 the Austria-Hungary government started surveying Cadastral surveying mapping all the land in their possession. They made Cadastral maps, which show boundaries and ownership of property. A Cadastre is a register of real estate. In the / this, as yet, unsettled was called Punta Cromatz. Beaches The rocky coast has a number of small beaches scattered along the coast. The Koromačno beach is next to the cement factory pier. The next one going west is the Dobra beach and is overlooked by the hamlet of the same name Dobra. The next beach still west is called Priponji beach. This is a secluded beach nestled between rough and rocky coast. Following this is a small beach which locals call Presicin beach. The area was called the \\"Pescheria\\" (fishery) in the old maps of 1820. The fisherman held nets from rowboats to trap fish in the nets. Slowly they dragged the full net to the beaches to gather the fish. On the east side of the cement factory, is the location of the Voscice beach.Voscice This beach has only a small inlet from the Gulf of Quarnero. The next beach is located not far, on the east side of Voscice, is called Barloda beach. There are many such small beaches along the coast of Istria. Tourists from all over Europe vacation on this coast. All the beaches consist of small rounded flat stones of many different colors. In the 1820 Cadastro Franceschino maps the beach was called Porto Voscice also called in 1632 Porto St. Giovanni and was one of the five ports on the east coast of Istria from Fianona to Voscice. This was the spot where a flat bottom boat called Trabacula came to load logs of timber for Trieste and Venice. The forest owners would cut trees and load them on a small pier where the boat would dock to load the timber. The boat captain would pay one half of the value of the timber and the other half on the next trip. According to the historians, in 1616, during the war with Turkey, in a small inlet of Punta Nera or Crna Punta a Turkish boat was anchored where it could not be seen by the sea or land. The local people happened to see the boat and called for help. They overtook the boat and took some prisoners of the crew. PageXVI Title:Archeografo Triestino: Raccolta di Memorie, Notizie, documenti...Vol. 1 Albona cenni storici Statuto Municipale della Citta d'Albona del A'1341 (Published by Societa del Gabinetto di Minerva in Trieste 1870) Cement factory In the early 1900 each of the properties of the area near the coast, where the future cement operation was to be built, were bought up by the Sicilian Industrialist, Mr. Conigliero, from the society S.P.E.M.A \\"Societa Potland e Marna Albona\\". The Director was Mr. D'Aquisto who lived temporarily in Brovinje. Mr. Conigliero visited, Koromačno with his wife once a year bringing gifts for all the children. Between 1920 and 1940 the hamlet Valmazzinghi, as it was called then, sprung up after the new cement factory was established. Later it was called Koromačno. There was need for housing as more and more new people came to work and settle there. The dwellings were built by the beach area which the natives called Dobro thus the hamlet of Dobra was born. In 1940 the chapel of St. Giuseppe was built in Koromačno, after WW2 the chapel became a movie theater. Then the bell tower was removed and later it became a market as it is today. School On the lower side of the, Labin to Koromačno road, at the very beginning of the hamlet, stands the building which was the Koromačno one room schoolhouse for grades 1–5 in the 1940–50s.One room schoolhouse built in the late 1940s by the cement company. Children enrolled from 1st grade to 5th grade. A third place classrooms were set was in an apartment building in Dobra. In the one room schoolhouse the teacher's apartment occupied the second floor. Outside the front door of the building was the bell which let the teacher signal the children to come in the classroom. There were three rows of double desks in the classroom. The teacher seated an older child next to the new child so that the older one would help the young one. As the population of children grew additional classrooms were needed. Each classroom had a specific grade. One of these classrooms was the house, the first one in Koromačno, which was located right across from the one room schoolhouse and on the upper side of the road. This was the Glavicich (Lemeh) house. This was in 1949. Two classroom were located on the ground floor. Later as the new apartment houses were built in the hamlet of Dobra for the workers of the cement quarry and factory, some of the classrooms were installed in those apartments for the growing population of children. Dobra Next to the hamlet-port of Koromačno, the cement factory built a group of buildings with multiple apartments in each. This new settlement is called Dobra. These modern buildings, in 1935–40, were made specifically for the cement factory workers and families which migrated to the area. Some of these were empty at the beginning. The need for classroom space made it necessary to occupy some of these empty apartments as the children population increased. A few miles north there is another hamlet called . From Brovinje going east and north is the hamlet of Skitača where the parish church of St Lucia delle lacrime, is still standing since the year 1616. From Brovinje going west is the hamlet of Viškovići and Diminići where the church of Sv Lovreč Labinski still standing since the 17th century. The cement factory became a very important employer for the local communities between the two wars. After the second World War automation caused jobs to disappear to a minimum at the end of the 20th century.St Lucia church, in Skitaca001 Turan The antique signaling tower Turan, also called Ivanac and St. Giovanni in Besca, was demolished in 1992 by the cement factory's progress in mining the quarry. There were many of these signaling towers on the Istria coast. These antique signaling towers were constructed under the Roman Empire and also used under the Venice Republic all along the coast and on high hills inland. At night a fire was lit and by day smoke was used to signal the other towers within view. At night these towers on the coast also were used to signal vessels coming to the area. These towers were set up in a net pattern so that each would be able see and to communicate with a few others which were visible to them.

St. Ivan 1930-1940 This chapel belonged to the Abbey by the same name. The Abbey consisted of a two story house, to the rear a separate building with rooms which each friar occupied. The Abbey was abandoned in the mid 16th century. The house was occupied by the farmer-worker (colonist) who took care of the property for the church. With the breakup of the noble class, the colonist farmer became possessor of the property. Road The gravel road from Labin to Koromačno and from Brovinje to Skitača was built in the 1930–40. Later it was cemented for easy travel. The company built a ship docking area to load the cement and to unload the coal, on which the factory operated. Later it became a minor port, Port Valmazzinghi/Koromačno, and occasionally the cargo ships brought Italian passengers to the area for vacation. Today the whole region is a booming vacation spot which more and more people discover yearly. Present There was an immense change in the area over the last hundred years. Communication and travel was made easier. Telephones came into operation at the central office and later at the Post Office. A regular bus schedule to Labin/Albona made it possible for the people to travel in less than one hour compared to walking for three hours. In the late 1950s electrification and in the 1960s a central water system arrived in the area. In the late 1990s the gravel roads were cemented for easy travel. The people who vacation yearly in the area come from all parts of Europe and the United States.

P. laevis facilitates its movement from its initial host. Research has demonstrated that organisms affected by the parasite exhibit a diminished or inverted avoidance response to the scent of predators when compared to uninfested specimens, supporting the notion that the parasite manipulates its host, with the goal of passing itself on to its definitive host, a freshwater fish. Affected specimens also demonstrate vibrant changes in color, making them more visible to predators. This worm swells its proboscis to press microneedles into the intestinal wall, with a very strong adhesive force. This has inspired a structural skin graft adhesive that sticks strongly but has minimal tissue damage while in place and upon removal. **Pomphorhynchus lucyi Williams & Rogers, 1984 **Pomphorhynchus megacanthus Fotedar and Dhar, 1977 **Pomphorhynchus moyanoi Olmes and Habit, 2007 **Pomphorhynchus omarsegundoi Arredondo and Gil de Pertierra, 2010 **Pomphorhynchus oreini Fotedar and Dhar, 1977 **Pomphorhynchus orientalis Fotedar and Dhar, 1977 **Pomphorhynchus patagonicus Ortubay, Ubeda, Semenas and Kennedy, 1991 **Pomphorhynchus perforator (von Linstow, 1908) **Pomphorhynchus purhepechus García-Varela, Mendoza-Garfias, Choudhury & Pérez-Ponce de León, 2017 **Pomphorhynchus rocci Cordonnier & Ward, 1967 **Pomphorhynchus sebastichthydis Yamaguti, 1939 **Pomphorhynchus sphaericus Pertierra, Spatz and Doma, 1996 **Pomphorhynchus spindletruncatus Amin, Abdullah and Mhaisen, 2003 **Pomphorhynchus tereticollis (Rudolphi, 1809) **Pomphorhynchus tori Fotedar and Dhar, 1977 **Pomphorhynchus yamagutii Schmidt and Higgins, 1973 **Pomphorhynchus yunnanensis Wang, 1981 **Pomphorhynchus zhoushanensis Li, Chen, Amin & Yang, 2017 Tenuiproboscis Yamaguti, 1935 *Tenuiproboscis bilqeesae Gupta & Naqvi, 1992 *Tenuiproboscis clupei Gupta & Sinha, 1992 *Tenuiproboscis edmondi Gupta & Naqvi, 1992 *Tenuiproboscis ernakulensis Gupta & Naqvi, 1992 *Tenuiproboscis guptai Gupta & Sinha, 1989 *Tenuiproboscis keralensis Kaur, Shamal, Chandran, Binesh, Gishnu, Asokan & Sanil, 2017 *Tenuiproboscis meyeri Saxena & Gupta, 2007 *Tenuiproboscis misgurni Yamaguti, 1935 Notes References *Pomphorhynchidae Yamaguti, 1939 at the World Register of Marine Species web- site Category:Acanthocephalans Category:Platyzoa families ","title":"Pomphorhynchidae"},{"id":"24709307","text":"Enrico Fermi High School (defunct) was a high school located in Enfield, Connecticut, and closed when it consolidated with Enfield High School in 2016. Overview Enrico Fermi High School was established in 1971. It previously served the Enfield community along with Enfield High School as one of the town's two high schools. Fermi High School Yearbooks have been archived online and are available at no cost. Consolidation with Enfield High School In May 2010, it was voted that Enfield High School and Enrico Fermi High School would be undergoing a consolidation process as part of the restructuring and improvement plan of Enfield Public Schools.http://www.enfieldschools.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_899572/File/06-01-10%20Special%20BOE%20Minutes%20DRAFT.pdf In November 2012, a town-wide referendum to appropriate $103 million for additions and renovations to Enfield High School overwhelmingly passed by a 2:1 margin.http://articles.courant.com/2012-11-07/community/hc-enfield-school- consolidation-1108-20121107_1_enfield-high-fermi-falcons-enfield-facebook-page As a result of the consolidation Enrico Fermi High School is planned to close, resulting in yearly savings of $2 million, which would pay for bonding for the renovations and additions to Enfield High School. The State of Connecticut also will provide more than 70% reimbursement for construction to Enfield High School, as well. Students from Enrico Fermi will move into the expanded high school after construction is finished in 2016-2017, with an expected town-wide high school enrollment of 1,500 students. Proposed use of the vacated building include moving the middle school to the Enrico Fermi location or renovating the building as a town library/community center. The Enrico Fermi name was used as the name of the new STEAM wing of the expanded and renovated Enfield High School. In 2016, Enrico Fermi High School closed, and its students attend Enfield High School. History The school is named after Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. A site for the school was purchased in February 1968 and a ground-breaking ceremony took place on September 14, 1968. The school opened for the 1971-72 school year with Mr. Anthony Torre as principal. Campus The building was designed by Charles \\"Ted\\" Bellingrath of Hartford firm Gibson von Dohlen and built by Fontaine Brothers of Springfield, MA. For several years the fields were off limits and sports teams were required to drive to different locations in order to practice as harmful chemicals were found in the soil. The fields were redone and improved.http://enfield- ct.gov/filestorage/725/5783/Enrico_Fermi_ENV_Report_ADDENDUM.pdf http://enfield-ct.gov/content/91/803/142/7433/6292.aspx \\"The Work\\" consists of remediation of approximately 41 acres of landscape area throughout the entire Fermi High School site. It is the intent of this project to cover the contaminated soil with new topsoil brought onto the site Curriculum The school offers a comprehensive college preparatory curriculum. Students may participate in Advanced Placement courses, University of Connecticut Early College Experience courses, and vocational education offered both at the school and Asnuntuck Community College. Extracurricular activities Student groups and activities at Enrico Fermi High School include art club, badminton club, bowling club, chess club, dance team, Lamplighters drama, DECA, FBLA, Future Teachers Club, LEO Club, Mathletes, Model United Nations, National Honor Society, peer mediation, Buzz Robotics, science club, video game club, ski club, a string ensemble, student council, Jazz Ensemble, and yearbook. The school's athletic teams, known as the Fermi Falcons, compete in the Central Connecticut Conference. Teams are fielded in baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, field hockey, football, golf, ice hockey, indoor track, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. The school has a cross-town rivalry with Enfield High School, playing a football game on Thanksgiving Day. In all other sports they compete as well, with each school having their favored teams. For example, Fermi’s wrestling team has historically beaten Enfield’s and Enfield High’s football team has not lost a football game to Fermi in many years.

Usually answered anonymously, surveys are also used to gain a holistic picture of employees' feelings on such areas as working conditions, supervisory impact, and motivation that regular channels of communication may not. Surveys are considered effective in this regard provided they are well-designed, effectively administered, have validity, and evoke changes and improvements.Knapp, Paul R. and Bahaudin G. Mujtaba. May 2010. \\"Designing, administering, and utilizing an employee attitude survey.\\" Journal of Behavioral Studies in Business. Volume 2  History  The first employee surveys, commonly known as employee-attitude surveys, surfaced in industrial companies in the 1920s. Between 1944 and 1947, the National Industrial Advisory Board saw a 250% jump in companies that chose to conduct an attitude survey (within a 3,500 company group).Viteles, Morris S. Motivation and Morale in Industry. New York: Norton, 1953. The increased awareness in measurement tools regarding employees' attitudes is attributed to research and observation conducted during World War II, which sought to measure morale and replicate high-morale environments. The United States Army Research Branch, for example, conducted Soldier Surveys, which recorded the opinions of more than half a million soldiers on topics ranging from food quality to confidence in leadership.Samuel Stouffer et al, Studies in Social Psychology in World War II (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1949), 1:Ch. 1 Examples of early survey methods include printed questionnaires, directive interviews, and unguided interviews.

This may include a focus on topics such as employee engagement, workplace culture, return on human capital (ROHC), and commitment. United States federal agencies are required by law to conduct an annual survey. The Office of Personnel Management states that employee influence is a primary reason for conducting surveys, stating, “This is your opportunity to influence change in your agency. Your participation is voluntary and your responses are confidential.”  Methodology  Organizations conduct their own surveys, contract with a survey provider, or use a combination of both. Main-line survey providers have traditionally used similar survey question types and survey length over the course of years and throughout various industries. Comparison databases provide standard ranges on which certain factors can be placed, as well as correlations between coexisting factors (allowing for emphasis on the factor with highest correlation to a desired outcome).Böckerman, Petri and Pekka Ilmakunnas. April 2012. \\"The Job Satisfaction-Productivity Nexus: A Study Using Matched Survey and Register Data.\\" ILR Review. vol. 65 no. 2. 244-262. In contrast, the advent of survey software, particularly online programs, has given organizational leadership tools to design and conduct their own surveys. In this case, the conducting leadership are responsible for tabulating and assessing the data.  Questions  A key component of employee surveys is the styling of questions. Variables in question design include:A.N. Oppenheim. Questionnaire Design and Attitude Measurement. Basic Books, Inc.

Opened to the public for the first time in 1965 (as Lunapark Milano), the park is a popular stop on Via Rivoltana near Idroscalo Lake. It is open seven days a week from March through September and on weekends throughout the year. Attractions Within the triangular park layout are roller coasters, a midway (alongside railroad tracks that form the back boundary of the property), a house of mirrors, a Ferris wheel, bumper cars (one for adults, \\"Miniautos\\" for school age children, and \\"Baby Karts\\" for small children), merry-go-rounds (and similar rides), two flume rides, houses of horrors, go- karts, a trip simulator, and various other fantasy and thrill rides. Each ride requires the purchase of a ticket (prices vary between one and ten euros per trip, depending on the ride itself). In addition, the park features a restaurant and a pub. Near the center of the park grounds is an enclosed \\"Playground\\" including plastic tunnels through which small children could crawl while their parents watch through a screen. History Lunapark Milano opened its gates for the first time in 1965 for a limited (45-day) season. In response to its growing success, its season expanded to two months in 1966 and three months in 1967.History of Europark Idroscalo Milano Lights were erected in the park in 1968, allowing the park to stay open into September.

The increasing cost of the new attractions caused a rift between the owners of the park and the concessionaires, culminating in a change of management (afterwards called \\"Luna Park Management\\") in 1977. The relationship between management and concessions became free of contention as the vendors agreed to pay higher rent as management continued to add attractions through 1980. By 2002, the finances of the park became precarious to the point of the management giving the concessionaires an ultimatum: anybody not renewing his lease would be evicted immediately and the attraction dismantled. The evictions were then deferred for one year; Lunapark Milano closed in 2003, seemingly permanently. New owners took over management of the park and renamed it Luna Europark Idroscalo Milano in 2004. Since then, an upgrading that the park had not seen for two decades resulted in a restoration of the crowds that were lost since the early 1970s. Technology – both in rides and in communications – was added to the park's offerings as it started to exhibit motion simulators and an adult-oriented house of horrors.

This point was referred to in the Treaty of Paris in 1783 and in later treaties including the Treaty of 1818. This point lies at the corner of the Northwest Angle of Minnesota and is thus the northernmost point in the lower 48 United States. After Canadian Confederation, the point became the basis for the border between Manitoba and Ontario. Example demonstrating how the most northwest point of the Lake of the Woods was determined. If the line intersects any part of the lake, it is determined not to be the most northwest point of the Lake of the Woods. The \\"northwesternmost point\\" of the lake had not yet been identified when it was referenced in treaties defining the border between the US and Britain; it was simply an easily described abstraction based on a large landmark. The best maps at the time of the original negotiation depicted the lake as a simple oval. However, although the southern portion of the lake is easily mapped, to the north it becomes a complex tangle of bays, peninsulas, and islands, with many adjacent bodies of water separated or connected by narrow isthmuses or straits. An 1822 survey crew declared the referenced point impossible to determine. In 1824, British explorer David Thompson was hired to identify it. Thompson mapped the lake and found four possibilities, but did not conclusively declare one location. Surveyors report (1912) of the northwesternmost point of Lake of the Woods In 1825, German astronomer in British service Dr. Johann Ludwig Tiarks surveyed the lake. Tiarks identified two possibilities for the northwesternmost point on the lake, based on Thompson's maps: the Angle Inlet and Rat Portage. To determine which point was the most northwestern, he drew a line from each point in the southwest-northeast direction. If the line intersected the lake at any point, it was not the most northwestern point, as shown in the example diagram here. Tiarks determined that the only such line that did not intersect the lake was at the edge of a pond on the Angle Inlet. (A 1940 academic study documents this point as being in the immediate vicinity of (NAD83).) Under the 1783 treaty, the international border would have run due west from this point to the Mississippi River. As this was determined to be geographically impossible (the Mississippi begins further south), under the 1818 treaty the international border instead ran from the point determined by Tiarks, to the 49th parallel. (It was not known at the time whether that was to the north or – in fact – the south.) From there it ran due west to the Rocky Mountains (and later, the Pacific coast). Tiarks' point, however, created problems, because the 1818 treaty called for the border to run directly north–south from it. South of that point, the channel of the Northwest Angle Inlet meandered east and west, crossing the border five times, thereby creating two small enclaves of water areas totaling two and a half acres that belonged to the United States but were surrounded by Canadian waters. A 1925 treaty addressed this by adopting the southernmost of the points where the channel and the border intersected – approximately south of Tiarks' point – as the new \\"northwesternmost point\\". The new northwesternmost point thus became , based on the NAD27 datum, which is equivalent to under the modern NAD83 datum.

Wildlife attacks in Australia occur every year from several different native species, including snakes, spiders, crocodiles, sharks, stingrays and stonefish and a variety of smaller marine creatures such as bluebottles, blue-ringed octopus, cone shells and jellyfish. Land Cassowary Cassowary Cassowaries have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animals. The 2007 edition of the Guinness World Records lists the cassowary as the world's most dangerous bird. During World War II American and Australian troops stationed in New Guinea were warned to steer clear of them. Many internet entries about cassowaries state that they can disembowel a man or dog with one kick, with the long second toe claw cutting the gut open. In his book Living Birds of the World from 1958, ornithologist Thomas E. Gilliard wrote: However, Gilliard did not include any such records or any references for them, and although this assessment of the danger posed by cassowaries has been repeated in print by authors including Gregory S. Paul (1988),Paul, G. S. (1988). and Jared Diamond (1997)Diamond, J. (2008). recent research on hundreds of cassowary attacks has only been able to find one human death. A 2003 study of attacks by the southern cassowary in Queensland found no wounds larger than punctures about 1.5 centimetres in diameter.Kofron, C. P. (2003). Of 221 attacks studied, 150 were against humans. 75% of these were from cassowaries that had been fed by people. 71% of the time the bird chased or charged the victim. 15% of the time they kicked. Of the attacks, 73% involved the birds expecting or snatching food, 5% involved defending natural food sources, 15% involved defending themselves from attack, 7% involved defending their chicks or eggs. Of all 150 attacks there was only one human death.Kofron, C. P. (1999). The one documented human death caused by a cassowary was that of Phillip Mclean, aged 16, and it happened on 6 April 1926. He and his brother, aged 13, were attempting to beat the cassowary to death with clubs. They were accompanied by their dog. The bird kicked the younger boy, who fell and ran away. Then the older boy struck the bird. The bird charged and knocked the older boy to the ground. While on the ground, Phillip was kicked in the neck, opening a 1.25 centimetre wound. Phillip got up and ran but died shortly afterwards from the haemorrhaging blood vessel in his neck. Cassowary strikes to the abdomen are among the rarest of all, but there is one case of a dog that was kicked in the belly in 1995. The blow left no puncture, but there was severe bruising. The dog later died from an apparent intestinal rupture.  Dingos  A dingo on the beach at Fraser Island Dingo attacks in Australia are rare but can happen. Dingos are more of a danger to livestock such as sheep which is why the Dingo Fence was constructed. As wild dogs are large predators, they can be potentially dangerous to humans. The likelihood of wild dogs being a danger to humans depends to a large degree on how humans behave toward them. The more frequently these dogs are fed or scavenge human leftovers, the more likely it is that they lose all caution and sometimes react aggressively towards humans when they no longer receive or find food. Even when habituation to humans seems to be the cause for attacks, it is not clear what the ultimate cause for attacks and overall threat towards humans is. The first well documented case of a dingo attack on Fraser Island is from the year 1988. Already 60 years before, a newspaper account reported of problems with dingoes. Between 1996 and 2001 altogether 279 incidences with dingoes have been reported, with 39 of the cases assessed as \\"major\\" and one as \\"catastrophic\\". In April 2001 at Waddy Point on Fraser Island, a nine-year-old male was attacked and killed by two dingoes.QLD.gov.au, E. Beckmann, Gillian Savage (June 2003). \\"Evaluation of Dingo Education Strategy and Programs for Fraser Island and Literature review: Communicating to the public about potentially dangerous wildlife in natural settings\\". Queensland Government. QLD.gov.au Retrieved 10 October 2009. On 19 August 1980 a nine-week-old girl named Azaria Chamberlain was captured by a dingo near the Uluru and killed. Her mother was suspected and convicted of murder. Four years later she was released from prison when the jacket of the baby was found in a dingo den and the mother was therefore found innocent. This incident caused much outcry for and against the dingoes. To be better prepared for dingo attacks demands were made that a better recording of problematic cases should be implemented. Also non-lethal guns, spray cans with appropriate content, whips and aversive baits should be used to increase the caution of the dingoes. \\"Problem-dingoes\\" should be killed, since relocation attempts proved to be ineffective.  Emu  Emu attacks which appeared in old Australian newspapers Emu attacks are rare but have occurred. When attacked, the emu will move in a zigzag pattern to prevent attacks from the wedge tailed eagle, or use kicking at close range.The Emu NSW government. In 1932 many emus moved into farm territory in Western Australia, with the army called in to dispatch them in the so-called Emu War. Some attacks noted include in 1957 an emu charged a car,Emu Attacks Speeding Car The Bend Bulletin (Oregon) 26 June 1957. in 1904 an emu attacked a dog's owner after the dog attacked it,Attacked by an emu The Argus 10 August 1904. in 1873 an emu attacked children and a woman at Johnstone Park, Geelong.Victoria, from Geelong Advertiser The Mercury 24 March 1873.

Kangaroos  Kangaroo attacks described in old newspapers. Kangaroo attacks in Australia are rare because kangaroos are usually docile however can attack if provoked or cornered, and have been known to kill dogs.

The New South Wales Court of Appeal ruled in Shorten v Grafton District Golf Club (2000) that a golf course had a duty of care to warn patrons of the danger of kangaroo attack, after a 13-year-old boy was injured by one in 1996. The Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management mentions kangaroos can be aggressive towards people, and advises that if approached by an aggressive kangaroo, people should keep it at a distance so that it cannot kick or scratch.Kangaroos introduction Qld DERM.

Magpies  A magpie defending its territory from a brown goshawk The Australian magpie often swoops people in suburban areas.Problem wildlife swooping birds There are two known deaths from a magpie attack: one caused by tetanus;Death from tetanus after magpie attack Canberra Times 25 October 1946. and the second when an elderly cyclist crashed his bicycle while attempting to avoid being dive-bombed. Magpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passers by.Jones, p. 37 These magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly \\"snap\\" their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and peck at the face and eyes.Jones, p. 48 Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.Jones, pp. 43–44 Magpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head and particularly the eyes, with potential detached retinas and bacterial infections from a beak used to fossick in the ground.Jones, p. 52 There have even been reports of anaphylaxis resulting from an attack. If it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck.Jones, p. 104 Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird. Magpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them. However, this protection is removed in some Australian states if a magpie attacks a human, allowing for the bird to be destroyed if it is considered particularly aggressive (such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act).  Snakes  The tiger snake was previously the most deadly snake before antivenom became increasingly available. Snake attacks in Australia which cause deaths are less common than they used to be due to increased medical knowledge and more readily available antivenom. Around half of all deaths from snakebites are caused by brown snakes. In Australia, the only continent where venomous snakes constitute the majority of species, the kraits, tiger snake and eastern brown snake inflict virtually all reported venomous bites. with the latter responsible for perhaps 60% of deaths caused by snakebite. Although Australian snakes are among the most venomous in the world, wide access to antivenom has made deaths exceedingly rare, with only a few fatalities each year. Australian snakes are known to possess particularly potent venom: 10 of the world's most venomous snakes, as measured by LD50 in mice, inhabit the continent. The estimated incidence of snakebites annually in Australia is between 3 and 18 per 100,000 with an average mortality rate of 4 per 100,000 per year. Between 1979 and 1998 there were 53 deaths from snakes, according to data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Fatalities from Venomous Animals Australian Venom Research Unit. Between 1942 and 1950 there were 56 deaths from snakebite recorded in Australia. Of 28 deaths in the 1945–49 period, 18 occurred in Queensland, 6 in New South Wales, 3 in Western Australia and 1 in Tasmania.Snakebite mortality in the world 1953 World Health Organisation. Availability of antivenom has reduced the number of fatalities from tiger snake bite, which previously had caused the most fatalities. Four types of tiger snake ranked among the top 10 of the world's most venomous snakes.The lethality in mice of dangerous Australian and other snake venom.Australian Venom Research Unit World's Most Venomous Snakes. The inland taipan is the most venomous land snake in the world, but is only located in remote desert regions. The red-bellied black snake is common, but less venomous than other deadly snakes.  Spiders  Redback spider There are spider attacks in Australia every year, but deaths are much less common, and are mostly in the very young or old. There have been 14 recorded deaths due to funnel-web spider bite.CSL Antivenom Handbook CSL Funnel Web Spider Antivenom. Between 1963 and 1976 there were more than 2000 cases of redback spider bites reported to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.redback-spider.com.au Red Back spider control, quoting Sutherland and Trinca 1978. There are more than 250 cases of redback spider bite which receive antivenom each year.redback- spider.com.au First aid for bites. There are around 2000 redback spider bites each year, while antivenom for funnel-web spider bites has been given to more than 100 patients since 1980.Australian Museum, spiderfacts quoting Sutherland, S K and Nolch, G (2000) Dangerous Australian Animals. Hyland House, Flemington, Vic. 201 pp. . It is believed that thousands of people are bitten each year across Australia by the redback spider, although only about 20% of bite victims require treatment. Besides the funnel-web spider and the redback spider, there is also the mouse spider which can cause severe illness in young children, although serious cases are rare. The white-tailed spider's bite can cause nausea and local pain.  Oceans, coasts and rivers   Blue-ringed octopus  Blue-ringed octopus from New South Wales The blue ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena maculosa) is only 10 cm long but carries enough tetrodotoxin venom to kill 26 adults, although records indicate it has only killed 3 humans. There is no blue-ringed octopus antivenom available.Dangers on the reef, Blue ringed octopus . Very few cases of children being envenomated are reported. Jelly fish Jellyfish stings in Australia can cause death, with there being several venomous species of jellyfish including the box jellyfish and Irukandji jellyfish. Bluebottles are often mistaken for jellyfish but are in fact siphonophores. Bluebottle Bluebottle The Australian bluebottle is Physalia utriculus (not to be confused with Physalia physalis) and stings from it rarely cause death. Outside Australia, bluebottles are known as \\"Portuguese man o' war\\". The bluebottle is responsible for between 10,000 and 30,000 stings on the eastern coast of Australia each summer, with only around 500 in Western Australia and South Australia combined.Species field guide bluebottle climatewatch.

Since shark netting began in 1937, the number of deaths from sharks on beaches has been reduced in New South Wales, with only one fatal attack on a netted beach during that time. In Queensland there has not been a fatal attack on a netted beach since nets were introduced in the 1960s.Sharks Rampage in Australia Time magazine 12 January 2009.

These include avoiding swimming far from the shore, at the mouth of a river or on drop-offs to deeper water; avoiding swimming in dirty water, swimming alone or with domestic animals, near people fishing, not swimming at dusk or at night, and to leave the water if schools of fish behave erratically or group in large numbers. Four species of sharks account for the vast majority of fatal attacks on humans: the bull shark, tiger shark, oceanic whitetip shark and the great white shark.

The Rotunda can be seen at center, with the halls visible in the background. All of these buildings were destroyed on April 4, 1865. The Quad is an approximately quadrangle on the campus of the University of Alabama located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Home to most of the university's original buildings, this portion of the campus remains the geographic and historic center of the modern campus. Originally designed by noted English- born architect William Nichols, construction of the university campus began in 1828, following the move of the Alabama state capital from Cahaba to Tuscaloosa in 1826. The overall design for this early version of the campus was patterned after Thomas Jefferson's plan for the University of Virginia, with its Lawn and Rotunda. Following the destruction of the campus during the American Civil War, a new Quad emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Different in form and function from the original design of the early 19th century, the modern Quad continues to fill its role as the heart of the campus. Although completely surrounded by academic and administrative buildings, only five structures are built directly on the Quad: the Little Round House, Tuomey Hall, Oliver-Barnard Hall, Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library, and Denny Chimes. The remainder of the space is occupied by a grove of trees on the west side and a great lawn on the east. A feature on the northwestern side, known as The Mound, is the site of the old Franklin Hall. A popular gathering place, the Quad is home to pep rallies, a bonfire during homecoming, and numerous day-to-day student activities. Old Quad Clark Hall, one of the first new buildings following the Civil War. It was built on the ruins of the old Lyceum. The Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library, built on the site of the old Rotunda. The Old Quad was rectangular and designed along a north–south axis. By the time of the university's destruction in 1865, the quadrangle featured the Lyceum at the center of the northern side, the wide, high Rotunda at the very center of the quadrangle, and the President's Mansion at the center of the southern side. A primary lane ran from the Lyceum in the north, circled the rotunda, and continued on to the President's Mansion in the south. Lining this lane between the Lyceum and Rotunda were six dormitories, three on each side. Another lane ran east to west in front of the Lyceum. To the west of the Lyceum were at least two faculty houses and the Gorgas House, then used as a dining hall. To the east was a faculty house and, at some distance away from the Quad, the Alabama Corps of Cadets gunpowder magazine. The Lyceum was a two-story brick building with an Ionic portico, very similar in design to the Lyceum that Nichols built several years later at the University of Mississippi. It housed laboratories and classrooms. The Rotunda, completed in 1833, was a three-story brick structure surmounted by a dome and surrounded by a two-story colonnade of twenty-four Ionic columns. An auditorium, used for ceremonies and church services, occupied its first two floors. The third floor housed the university's 7,000-volume library and natural history collection. Near the northwest side of the Rotunda stood a guardhouse, now known as the Little Round House. It was the only structure on the Quad with a direct military purpose. Four of the dormitories were three-story brick buildings, Washington and Franklin halls on the west side of the Quad and Jefferson and Madison halls on the east. Two one-story frame buildings, Johnson and Lee halls, were built in 1863, one between Washington and Franklin and another between Jefferson and Madison. The Alabama Legislature converted the university over to the military system on February 23, 1860. This decision proved disastrous, as it turned the school into a military target during the Civil War. During the war the university became known as the \\"West Point of the Confederacy,\\" sending roughly 200 cadets into the field each year. On April 3, 1865 Union Brigadier General John T. Croxton and 1500 cavalrymen approached Tuscaloosa with orders to destroy all targets of military value in the town. On April 4 Croxton sent Colonel Thomas M. Johnston and two hundred men to burn the university. In the midst of carrying out his orders, university faculty pleaded with Johnston to spare the Rotunda and its library. Johnston sent a message via courier to Croxton, asking if he might spare the building. Croxton replied \\"My orders leave me no discretion... My orders are to destroy all public buildings.\\" By the time that his men had completed their orders only seven university buildings remained: the Gorgas House, President's Mansion, Observatory (not on the Quad), the Little Round House, and a few faculty residences. Modern Quad Denny Chimes on the Quad Following the destruction of the campus, the university remained closed to students until 1871. When it reopened, it had a total enrollment of only 107 students. The first building to be built on the campus was Woods Hall, completed in 1868. It was built well north of the Quad, with bricks from the destroyed Quad buildings. The Quad itself did not become home to any new buildings until the 1880s, following the end of the Reconstruction era. Completed in 1884, Clark Hall was the first new structure facing the Quad. Built on the site of the Lyceum, the Gothic Revival-style building was designed as an all purpose building, with a library, chapel, and a public meeting room. It was followed by two additional Gothic Revival-style buildings, flanking it to the west and east: Manly Hall in 1885 and Garland Hall in 1888. They both were designed as multifunctional structures, with Garland housing the first Alabama Museum of Natural History. Two smaller Gothic Revival-style buildings, Tuomey and Oliver-Barnard halls were completed in 1889, directly on the Quad to the south of the Manly, Clark, and Garland grouping. The Quad was the first on-campus site for Alabama Crimson Tide football home games. The Tide played there from 1893 to 1914 before moving to Denny Field. The Quad came to be surrounded by academic buildings during a flurry of building activity in the early 20th century. From 1910 onward, all buildings facing the Quad would be built in the Classical Revival and Beaux-Arts styles. The first of this group was the Beaux-Arts-style Smith Hall, built in 1910 as the new home of the Alabama Museum of Natural History. Next was the Beaux-Arts-style Morgan Hall, built in 1911 as a complement to Smith Hall. It initially housed the School of Law. Little Hall, in Classical-Revival-style, was built in 1915 to house a gymnasium. The adjoining Moore Hall was built in 1935 as an extension of Little and did not receive a name until 1975. The 1920s saw more building activity around the Quad than any other period since the initial construction of the university. It saw the construction of Nott Hall in 1922, Carmichael Hall in 1925, Lloyd and Farrah halls in 1927, Bidgood Hall in 1928, and Bibb Graves Hall, Doster Hall, and the Alabama Union (present-day Reese Phifer Hall) in 1929. Denny Chimes, a campanile on the southern end of the Quad was also completed in 1929. The Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library was the last structure built directly on the Quad, on the site of the former Rotunda. The five-floor Classical Revival building was completed in 1939. Some of the foundation ruins of the Rotunda were preserved under the semi-circular plaza adjoining the front portico. In 1949 Gallalee Hall was built to house a new observatory. The last building constructed facing the Quad was the Rose Administration Building, completed in 1969. It was built on the site of the first incarnation of Julia Tutwiler Hall, a dormitory built in 1914 and demolished to make way for the new building.

Lionsgate Home Entertainment released the DVD and Blu- ray on August 16, 2011. Plot On April 14, 1865, five days after the Civil War ends with the South's surrender to the North at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, lawyer and Union veteran Frederick Aiken, with his friends, William Thomas Hamilton and Nicholas Baker, and his girlfriend, Sarah Weston, celebrate. Later that night, Southerner Lewis Payne seriously wounds Secretary of State William Seward in an unsuccessful assassination attempt. German immigrant and carriage repair business owner George Atzerodt is assigned to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson but becomes afraid and runs away. Meanwhile, actor John Wilkes Booth enters Ford's Theatre and sees his target, President Abraham Lincoln. Booth sneaks into the President's box, shoots Lincoln, and mortally wounds him. Booth stabs diplomat and military officer Henry Rathbone, who was a guest in Lincoln's box, and leaps onto the stage, shouting, \\"Sic Semper Tyrannis! Death To Tyrants!\\" before escaping. A crowd, including Aiken, Hamilton, and Baker, watches in horror as the unconscious President is taken to a nearby boarding house, where he dies early the next morning. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton orders all suspects, including Mary Surratt, arrested. Booth and David Herold manage to evade capture for some days, but Union soldiers find a barn where they suspect the conspirators are hiding and set it on fire. Herold is arrested, and Booth is shot and killed by sergeant Boston Corbett. Maryland Senator Reverdy Johnson is Mary Surratt's lawyer. Her son, John Surratt, had escaped with hundreds of agents looking for him. Feeling unable to defend Surratt because he is a Southerner, Reverdy asks Aiken, a Northerner, to take over. He tries to refuse, but ordered to defend her, he tells Sarah and his friends, who are shocked. Aiken visits Mary in her cell to question her. Mary asks Aiken to look in on her daughter, Anna. Aiken does so and searches the boarding house for clues. He finds a ticket with the initials \\"LJW\\" (Louis J. Weichmann). At the court, Weichman, a seminary friend of Mary's son John, is the first witness and describes John's meetings with Booth. Aiken incriminates Weichman by making him appear as guilty as the rest of the conspirators. Aiken again tries to give up defending Mary since he believes her to be guilty. He meets with her with the intention of getting evidence of her guilt. She explains that John and the others conspired to kidnap Lincoln, not to kill him. They were about to attack a carriage but were stopped by Booth, who reported that Lincoln was elsewhere. She says that John left town and went into hiding two weeks before the assassination. Aiken asks Anna for information to help with his trial preparations, but she refuses. At the court, Chief Prosecutor Joseph Holt brings the innkeeper John Lloyd to the stand. Lloyd claims that Mary sent binoculars to Booth and prepared shooting irons and whiskey for Booth and Herold on the night of the assassination. Aiken angers Lloyd by implying that he was bribed for his testimony in whiskey. Lloyd is dragged out of the courtroom after he threatens Aiken. While attempting to attend a party at the Century Club, Aiken finds his membership has been revoked because for defending Mary Surratt. That triggers an argument with Sarah, who disowns and leaves him. Aiken asks Anna to testify next. Anna testifies that Mary had no part in the assassination of Lincoln but that it was her brother John instead. Anna visits Aiken at his house, tells him about Booth and John, and sends him to John\\"s hiding place. He brings the message that John must surrender, or his mother will hang for his crimes. On July 6, Mary is found guilty on all charges and, with Stanton's intervention, sentenced to hang with three others on the 7th. Aiken procures a writ of habeas corpus to try Mary in civilian court, but President Johnson suspends the writ, and Mary is hanged. Sixteen months later, Aiken visits John Surratt, who was captured abroad and is in jail. John thanks him for his kindness to his mother. Aiken offers him Mary's rosary, but he declines. The epilogue goes on to state that a year later, the US Supreme Court ruled that citizens were entitled to trial by a civilian jury, not a military tribunal, even in times of war (Ex parte Milligan), and that a jury of Northerners and Southerners could not agree on a verdict for John Surratt, and he was freed. Aiken left the law and became The Washington Posts first City Editor.

Between 1944 and 1949 he published in Bis, Agora, Timpul, Arcades, Națiunea, Universul. Between 1949 and 1960 he was not allowed to publish under his own name, due to political reasons. The only exceptions were monographies about painters or sculptors: Octav Băncilă (1954), Abgar Baltazar (1956), Viaţa şi opera lui Rembrandt van Rijn (\\"The Life And Work of Rembrandt\\")(1957), Nicolae Grigorescu (1959), Ştefan Luchian (1960). Later, he would also write about other well-known Romanian visual artists, such as Gheorghe Petrașcu, Theodor Pallady, Nicolae Tonitza, Francisc Șirato, Ion Țuculescu, sometimes even in English The Romanian and the Universal in Brâncuși's Work (1970). Trying to avoid being marginalized, he compromised with the Communist authorities, such as by joining the Partidul Muncitoresc Român (Romanian Workers' Party, later called Partidul Comunist Român- Romanian Communist Party).

He was critically acclaimed by his contemporaries, Camil Petrescu calling him \\"the leader\\" of their generation, Barbu Brezianu its \\"herald\\", Mircea Eliade its \\"magus\\". Comarnescu was married to Gina Manolescu-Strunga, the daughter of a liberal politician, but she had been in love with N. D.

The El Camino sold very well, leaving GM South Africa with no more trucks but a surplus of passenger car parts in early 1972, when the succeeding HQ series was already on its way. The solution was to use up material for 3400 Constantias and Kommandos to build El Camino pickup trucks. These hybrids had considerably better equipment than the regular utility, and proved very popular with consumers, allowing GMSA to make a small profit on the entire deal.

The principle states that no object or property may be introduced by a definition that depends on that object or property itself. In addition to ruling out definitions that are explicitly circular (like \\"an object has property P iff it is not next to anything that has property P\\"), this principle rules out definitions that quantify over domains which include the entity being defined. Thus, it blocks Russell's paradox, which defines a set R that contains all sets which don't contain themselves. This definition is blocked because it defines a new set in terms of the totality of all sets, of which this new set would itself be a member. However, it also blocks one standard definition of the natural numbers. First, we define a property as being \\"hereditary\\" if, whenever a number n has the property, so does n+1. Then we say that x has the property of being a natural number if and only if it has every hereditary property that 0 has. This definition is blocked, because it defines \\"natural number\\" in terms of the totality of all hereditary properties, but \\"natural number\\" itself would be such a hereditary property, so the definition is circular in this sense. Most modern mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics think that this particular definition is not circular in any problematic sense, and thus they reject the vicious circle principle. But it was endorsed by many early 20th-century researchers, including Bertrand Russell and Henri Poincaré. On the other hand, Frank P. Ramsey and Rudolf Carnap accepted the ban on explicit circularity, but argued against the ban on circular quantification. After all, the definition \\"let T be the tallest man in the room\\" defines T by means of quantification over a domain (men in the room) of which T is a member. But this is not problematic, they suggest, because the definition doesn't actually create the person, but merely shows how to pick him out of the totality. Similarly, they suggest, definitions don't actually create sets or properties or objects, but rather just give one way of picking out the already existing entity from the collection of which it is a part. Thus, this sort of circularity in terms of quantification can't cause any problems. This principle was the reason for Russell's development of the ramified theory of types rather than the theory of simple types. (See \\"Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles\\".) > An analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result from a > kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise from supposing > that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined > by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of > propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that “all > propositions are either true or false.” It would seem, however, that such a > statement could not be legitimate unless “all propositions” referred to some > already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are > created by statements about “all propositions.” We shall, therefore, have to > say that statements about “all propositions” are meaningless.… The principle > which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be stated as follows: > “Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the collection”; > or, conversely: “If, provided a certain collection had a total, it would > have members only definable in terms of that total, then the said collection > has no total.” We shall call this the “vicious-circle principle,” because it > enables us to avoid the vicious circles involved in the assumption of > illegitimate totalities.

History Various states throughout history have governed, or claimed to govern, in the name of the common people. In Europe, a distinct concept analogous to common people arose in the Classical civilization of ancient Rome around the 6th century BC, with the social division into patricians (nobles) and plebeians (commoners). The division may have been instituted by Servius Tullius, as an alternative to the previous clan-based divisions that had been responsible for internecine conflict. The ancient Greeks generally had no concept of class and their leading social divisions were simply non-Greeks, free-Greeks and slaves.Though Plato did recognise a fundamental division into rich and poor – \\"Any city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich; these two cities are at war.\\" – The Republic (Plato), Part I, book IV. The early organisation of Ancient Athens was something of an exception with certain official roles like archons, magistrates and treasurers being reserved for only the wealthiest citizens – these class-like divisions were weakened by the democratic reforms of Cleisthenes who created new vertical social divisions in contrasting fashion to the horizontal ones thought to have been created by Tullius. Both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire used the Latin term Senatus Populusque Romanus, (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the Roman Emperors achieved a state of total personal autocracy, they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome. manuscript illustration depicting the three estates: clergy (oratores), nobles (bellatores), and commoners (laboratores). With the growth of Christianity in the 4th century AD, a new world view arose that underpinned European thinking on social division until at least early modern times. Saint Augustine postulated that social division was a result of the Fall of Man. The three leading divisions were considered to be the priesthood (clergy), the nobility, and the common people. Sometimes this was expressed as \\"those who prayed\\", \\"those who fought\\" and \\"those who worked\\". The Latin terms for the three classes – oratores, bellatores and laboratores – are often found even in modern textbooks, and have been used in sources since the 9th century. This threefold division was formalised in the estate system of social stratification, where again commoners were the bulk of the population who are neither members of the nobility nor of the clergy. They were the third of the Three Estates of the Realm in medieval Europe, consisting of peasants and artisans. Social mobility for commoners was limited throughout the Middle Ages. Generally, the serfs were unable to enter the group of the bellatores. Commoners could sometimes secure entry for their children into the oratores class; usually they would serve as rural parish priests. In some cases they received education from the clergy and ascended to senior administrative positions; in some cases nobles welcomed such advancement as former commoners were more likely to be neutral in dynastic feuds. There were cases of serfs becoming clerics in the Holy Roman Empire,DEVAILLY, Le Berry du X siècle au milieu du XIII siècle, p. 201; CHEDEVILLE, Chartres et ses campagnes, p.336. though from the Carolingian era, clergy were generally recruited from the nobility.PERROY, E., Le Monde carolingien, Paris, SEDES, 2.ª ed., 1975, p.143. Of the two thousand bishops serving from the 8th to the 15th century, just five came from the peasantry.BRETT, M., Middle Ages, Encyclopædia Britannica, 15.ª ed., 1979, 12, p.1965. The social and political order of medieval Europe was relatively stable until the development of the mobile cannon in the 15th century. Up until that time a noble with a small force could hold their castle or walled town for years even against large armies - and so they were rarely disposed. Once effective cannons were available, walls were of far less defensive value and rulers needed expensive field armies to keep control of a territory. This encouraged the formation of princely and kingly states, which needed to tax the common people much more heavily to pay for the expensive weapons and armies required to provide security in the new age. Up until the late 15th century, surviving medieval treaties on government were concerned with advising rulers on how to serve the common good: Assize of Bread is an example of medieval law specifically drawn up in the interests of the common people. But then works by Philippe de Commines, Niccolò Machiavelli and later Cardinal Richelieu began advising rulers to consider their own interests and that of the state ahead of what was \\"good\\", with Richelieu explicitly saying the state is above morality in doctrines such as Raison d'Etat. This change of orientation among the nobles left the common people less content with their place in society. A similar trend occurred regarding the clergy, where many priests began to abuse the great power they had due to the sacrament of contrition. The Reformation was a movement that aimed to correct this, but even afterwards the common people's trust in the clergy continued to decline – priests were often seen as greedy and lacking in true faith. An early major social upheaval driven in part by the common people's mistrust of both the nobility and clergy occurred in Great Britain with the English Revolution of 1642. After the forces of Oliver Cromwell triumphed, movements like the Levellers rose to prominence demanding equality for all. When the general council of Cromwell's army met to decide on a new order at the Putney Debates of 1647, one of the commanders, Colonel Thomas Rainsborough, requested that political power be given to the common people. According to historian Roger Osbourne, the Colonel's speech was the first time a prominent person spoke in favour of universal male suffrage, but it was not to be granted until 1918. After much debate it was decided that only those with considerable property would be allowed to vote, and so after the revolution political power in England remained largely controlled by the nobles, with at first only a few of the most wealthy or well-connected common people sitting in Parliament. The rise of the bourgeoisie during the Late Middle Ages, had seen an intermediate class of wealthy commoners develop, which ultimately gave rise to the modern middle classes. Middle-class people could still be called commoners however, for example in England Pitt the Elder was often called the Great Commoner, and this appellation was later used for the 20th-century American anti-elitist campaigner William Jennings Bryan. The interests of the middle class were not always aligned with their fellow commoners of the working class. Social historian Karl Polanyi wrote that in 19th-century Britain, the new middle class turned against their fellow commoners by seizing political power from the upper classes via the Reform Act 1832. Early industrialisation had been causing economic distress to large numbers of working class commoners, leaving them unable to earn a living. The upper classes had provided protection such as workhouses where inmates could happily \\"doss\\" about and also a system of \\"outdoor\\" Outdoor relief means monetary or other assistance given to the poor without them needing to enter a workhouse to receive it. relief both for the unemployed and those on low income. Though early middle class opposition to the Poor Law reform of William Pitt the Younger had prevented the emergence of a coherent and generous nationwide provision, the resulting Speenhamland system did generally save working class commoners from starvation. In 1834 outdoor relief was abolished,Though some Lords, Ladys and well to do church people continued to offer it, in defiance of the Law. and workhouses were deliberately made into places so dehumanising that folk often preferred to starve rather than enter them. For Polanyi this related to the economic doctrine prevalent at the time which held that only the spur of hunger could make workers flexible enough for the proper functioning of the free market. Later the same Laissez-faire free market doctrine led to British officials turning a blind eye to the suffering in the Great Famine of Ireland and various Indian famines and acts of exploitation in colonial adventures. By the late 19th century, at least in mainland Britain, economic progress has been sufficient that even the working class were generally able to earn a good living, so working and middle class interests began to converge, lessening the division within the ranks of common people. Polanyi writes that on continental Europe middle and working class interests did not diverge anywhere near as markedly as they had in Britain. Modern politics A People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the common people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship. Populism is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the common people, usually with an implication that they serve the common people instead of the elite. Breakdown of the trifold division US Vice President Henry A. Wallace proclaimed the \\"arrival of the century of the common man\\" in a 1942 speech broadcast nationwide in the United States. After the French Revolution, the Napoleonic wars and with industrialization, the division in three estates - nobility, clergy and commoners - had become somewhat outdated. The term \\"common people\\" continued to be used, but now in a more general sense to refer to regular people as opposed to the privileged elite. Communist theory divided society into capitalists on one hand, and the proletariat or the masses on the other. In Marxism, the people are considered to be the creator of history. By using the word \\"people\\", Marx did not gloss over the class differences, but united certain elements, capable of completing the revolution. The Intelligentsia's sympathy for the common people gained strength in the 19th century in many countries. For example, in Imperial Russia a big part of the intelligentsia was striving for its emancipation. Several great writers (Nekrasov, Herzen, Tolstoy etc.) wrote about sufferings of the common people. Organizations, parties and movements arose, proclaiming the liberation of the people. These included among others: \\"People's Reprisal\\", \\"People’s Will\\", \\"Party of Popular Freedom\\" and the \\"People's Socialist Party\\". In the United States, a famous 1942 speech by vice president Henry A. Wallace proclaimed the arrival of the \\"century of the common man\\" saying that all over the world the \\"common people\\" were on the march, specifically referring to Chinese, Indians, Russians, and as well as Americans. Wallace's speech would later inspire the widely reproduced popular work Fanfare for the Common Man by Aaron Copland. In 1948, U.S. President Harry S. Truman made a speech saying there needs to be a government \\"that will work in the interests of the common people and not in the interests of the men who have all the money.\\" Social divisions in non- Western civilisations Comparative historian Oswald Spengler found the social separation into nobility, priests and commoners to occur again and again in the various civilisations that he surveyed (although the division may not exist for pre-civilised society). As an example, in the Babylonian civilisation, The Code of Hammurabi made provision for punishments to be harsher for harming a noble than a commoner.Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society By Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret C.

ABC broadcast AFL games from the league's first season in 1960 until the 1964 season, when NBC took over as the league's primary network television broadcaster. Terms of the deal On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the AFL Championship Game and the AFL All-Star Game. These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on Thanksgiving Day. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the National Football League would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts. Innovations ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players \\"miked\\" during broadcast games. List of commentators Pat Hernon hosted ABC's national postgame show out of New York. While ABC did show scores and updates from both the AFL and NFL, seldom if ever did viewers see any actual AFL highlights except from the game that had just been broadcast in their region, or nationally.

They are under the rule of a king, who has forbidden them to kill humans. Therefore they bring down various diseases upon humans, so that they can gain the satisfaction that they are denied because of this ban. Victims who are believed to have been affected by demons then have to be cured and the demons repelled through exorcism rituals.  Origins  Demons are believed to spring into existence, fully grown (known as opapatika in the Pali language) rather than being given birth by a mother. However, some demons, like the Kola Sanni Yaka have been born to human parents and later become demons. Another demon that was born in an unusual way is the Maha Sohona, who had been revived by a god after being killed, but returned from the dead as a demon.  Demon community  The demons form a large community, and are led by a king named Wesamuni (also referred to as Wessamony in some sources). Wesamuni is feared by all the demons and he rules them with an iron fist. Any wrongdoing is punished severely, often by death. There are 32 torturous punishments he can hand out, including boiling, roasting, impaling, and pouring molten metal down the offender's throat. King Wesamuny has a magical golden sword which can fly out of his hand, behead a thousand \\"with the rapidity of lightning\\" and return to his hand again, all of its own accord. The demons were once independent and freely attacked humans and ate them. However, Wesamuni has since forbidden them to attack humans directly, and they are allowed only to afflict diseases and suffering. This is believed to earn the demons a satisfaction similar to that of killing humans. One of the most notorious and feared demons is the Reeri Yakseya, who is believed to be capable of inflicting every kind of disease. There are two types of demons. The first are closer to the status of gods or deities, and live in the upper regions of the sky in large and elaborate palaces. These dewatawas are believed to be wise and powerful and not harmful to humans. The second type of demons also live in the sky, but closer to the surface of the Earth. They are cruel and savage, revelling in human misery, and are feared by the Sinhalese. They are invisible to the human eye, but most are considered to be black- skinned and have long white teeth.  Yaksa Sabawa  On every Wednesday and Saturday, all the demons assemble together. This assembly is called the \\"Yaksa Sabawa\\". At this assembly, each chieftain has to give an account to Wesamuni about the activities and conduct of his subjects. After this is done, all the demons engage in merry-making, and also display their various skills.  Exorcism  Traditional exorcism rituals such as the Sanni Yakuma are held to ward off demons when a person is believed to have been affected by them. These rituals are closely connected with the Pahatharata dancing form. The exorcism rituals, which are often long and elaborate, involve performances with dancers dressed as various demons accompanied by drums. Offerings are presented to the demon, in exchange for which the demon agrees to leave the victim.

The smaller form factor Nano-ITX motherboard lacks a CPU socket module which limits its flexibility for different applications. Noise Due to a mobile CPU having lower power requirements, there is less heat generated by the CPU and internal components, and the thermal design is simplified. With its passive cooling design, it is typically noiseless and the manufacturing costs and overall operating power requirements are lower relative to active cooling designs. Stability Mini-ATX motherboards use surface-mount technology, solid state capacitors and 8 layers PCB design to maximize reliability. Flexibility The DC-to-DC converter solution design removes the power supply unit from a Mini-ATX case.

There are actually 10 isomers with this same structure. In organic chemistry, a cyclitol is a cycloalkane containing at least three hydroxyl, each attached to a different ring carbon atom. The general formula for an unsubstituted cyclitol is or where 3 ≤ x ≤ n. The name is also used for compounds that can be viewed as result of substituting various functional groups for the hydrogen atoms in such a molecule, as well as similar molecules with one or more double bonds in the ring. Cyclitols and their derivatives are some of the compatible solutes which are formed in a plant as a response to salt or water stress. Some cyclitols (e.g. quinic or shikimic acid) are parts of hydrolysable tannins. Isomerism and nomenclature Unsubstituted cyclitols with the same ring size and number of hydoxyls may exist in several structural isomers, depending on the position of the hydroxyls along the ring. For example, cyclohexanetriol exists in three distinct isomers (1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, and 1,3,5-). Furthermore, the hydrogen and the hydroxyl on each carbon atom may lie in two possible arrangements relative to the local ring plane; so that each structural isomer may exist in several stereoisomers, depending on which side of the ring plane the hydroxyls are. For example, there are nine stereoisomers of 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol (inositol), and two of them are enantiomers.

It is also referred to as leprosy-related stigma, leprostigma, and stigma of leprosy. Since ancient times leprosy instilled the practice of fear and avoidance in many societies because of the associated physical disfigurement and lack of understanding behind its cause. Because of the historical trauma the word \\"leprosy\\" invokes, the disease is now referred to as Hansen's disease, named after Gerhard Armauer Hansen who discovered Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterial agent that causes Hansen's disease. Those who have suffered from Hansen's disease describe the impact of social stigma as far worse than the physical manifestations despite it being only mildly contagious and pharmacologically curable. This sentiment is echoed by Weis and Ramakrishna, who noted that “the impact of the meaning of the disease may be a greater source of suffering than symptoms of the disease”. Definition of Stigma The word 'stigma' originated from the Greeks who used it to “refer to bodily signs designed to expose something unusual and bad about the moral status” of a person. These bodily signs can be thought of as the lesions causing physical deformities in a person's skin in the context of leprosy. American sociologist Erving Goffman defines \\"stigma\\" as an attribute that is deeply discrediting; a stigmatized individual is one who is not accepted and not accorded the respect and regard of his peers, who is disqualified from full social acceptance. It is associated with 1) physical deformities, such as facial plaques, facial palsy, claw hand deformity or footdrop; 2) blemishes of character, such as are associated with alcoholism, drug addition, or leprosarium; or 3) race, nation, social class, sexuality and religion that are thought of as second-class by another group.Erving Goffman: Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity. Englewood Cliffs. Prentice-Hall Inc., 1963William Jopling. \\"Leprosy stigma,\\" in Leprosy Review (1991), Vol. 62, 1-12. Stigma itself is constructed based on “historical processes, cross-cultural differences, and structural inequalities,” which determine social norms. History of leprosy stigma thumb Leprosy stigma has been associated with the disease for most of its history and has been universal. In Western Europe, it reached its peak during the Middle Ages, at a time when the disease was viewed as rendering the person \\"unclean\\". Many \\"lazar houses\\" were built. Patients had to carry bells to signal their presence but also to attract charitable gifts. The discovery by Hansen in 1873 that leprosy was infectious and transmitted by a bacterium worsened leprosy stigma. It long became associated with sexually transmitted diseases and during the nineteenth century was even thought to be a stage of syphilis.\\"Blessed Damien of Molokai\\" The stigma of the disease was renewed among Europeans in the imperial era when they found it was \\"hyperepidemic in regions that were being colonized.\\" It became associated with poor, developing countries, whose residents were believed by Europeans to be inferior in most ways. Since the late twentieth century, with efforts by the World Health Organization to control the disease through distribution of free medication, many international organizations have been working to end the stigma attached to leprosy. They work to educate people and raise awareness of the facts about leprosy, in particular that it is only mildly contagious; some 95% of people are immune to the bacterium that causes it. Instances of leprosy stigma Stigma surrounding Hansen's disease often favored society and sacrificed the individual rights of those afflicted. Numerous societies in the Middle Ages and nineteenth and twentieth centuries required separation of persons with leprosy from the general population. In some countries, stigma against people affected by leprosy is still widespread. Japan In Japan, the government required segregation of persons with leprosy, a separation that increased the social stigma against them. In medieval times, leprosy patients lived apart, settling around temples or shrines, where they begged for charity from passers-by. Starting in 1909, the government required leprosy patients to be hospitalized in the leprosy sanatoria, believing this would prevent transmission of the disease. In some cases, patients were forcibly taken to the sanatoria and their houses were disinfected in the presence of neighbors. Their families were also affected by leprosy stigma. Some patients attempted suicide. The law lasted until 1996. *In Kumamoto, Japan, a patient with leprosy named Matsuo Fujimoto was tried on charges of an explosion in 1951 and murder in 1952. During the questioning and trial procedures, he was discriminated against as a leprosy patient. He was convicted and executed in 1962. *Kumamoto Prefecture Governor Yoshiko Shiotani reported in 2003 that a hotel rejected reservations of ex-patients of Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium who were on the Prefecture's home visit program. Many people protested against the hotel. When the patients rejected the apology of the hotel, there were violent protests against the patients. The hotel tore down this building in June 2004.Hyakunen no seisou (100 years of Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium), 2009 (Japanese) In the Japanese drama film Sweet Bean directed by Naomi Kawase (2015) the issue of leprosy stigma affecting the character of Tokue turns out to be the main subject of the story and leads to a brief description of an existing community of ex-patients. Scandinavia In Jopling's original report, he quoted Hansen as saying \\"the Norwegian state has always handled its leprosy victims humanely\\". Hospitalized patients were free to go out during the day to sell their handwork in the market, and were allowed to have visitors. There was little evidence of stigma. Many patients immigrated to the United States, but that was because of seeking to escape poverty. Southern Europe and Russia India The concept of heredity was deeply rooted, and when leprosy was thought to be inherited, persons with the disease (and their children) were shunned. As deformity was considered divine punishment, stigma was associated with it. China Kaili, Guizhou Evidence of leprosy can be traced as far back as 500-300 B.C. in Chinese literature, when it was considered punishment for amoral acts. Leprosy stigma has been considerable, though it has declined since the late twentieth century. Its resulting facial disfigurement and mutilation of limbs was feared. The disease's long incubation period resulted in mystery for centuries about its origins, inspiring horror, fear and disgust. In current day China, leprosy is strongly associated with poverty and stigma remains a significant barrier to effective treatment.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1136867/discrimination- still-plagues-leprosy-victims-mainland-china United States Hawaii In 1865, the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement was founded on the island of Molokai, a geographically isolated peninsula bordered high mountains (\\"the pali\\") on one side a rough sea waters and coral reef on the other, served as a prison for those with inflicted by Hansen's disease on the Hawaiian Islands. By 1865 the rising numbers of Hansen's disease patients could no longer be ignored, the “Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy of the nation of Hawaii” was passed which criminalized leprosy and sentenced victims to permanent exile. The quarantine of lepers was based on the new assumption of leprosy being a highly contagious disease. Stigmatization of leprosy began as “a relatively unknown disease [changed] into a socially and morally threatening phenomenon”. Those with severe cases were sent to Kalawao, an isolated settlement on the island of Molokai. Later a second and larger settlement was developed at Kalaupapa. This settlement had a peak population of about 1100 shortly after the turn of the twentieth century; in total about 8500 persons were quarantined here over the decades until 1965. Both settlements are in Kalawao County. The entire county is now within what is known as the Kalaupapa National Historical Park, which preserves both the major structures of the settlements and the associated environment of the area. For the Native Hawaiians, who constituted most of the Hansen’s disease patients, exile was devastating. Culturally, they believed their self-identity was intrinsically tied to their land. To relocate them to Kalaupapa as exiles was just the same as stripping them of their identity. The stigma of Hansen’s disease also led to no medical services between 1865-1873 on Kalaupapa. No doctors were sent there because they were afraid of becoming infected. Only kokua, family members, and Father Damien tended to the victims of Hansen’s disease on Molokai. Kalaupapa was an innovative approach to a solution for leprosy by Westerners, which became a model for controlling disease worldwide: it was the first time ostracized and shunned people were torn from families and transported to a remote prison island. After quarantine ended in 1960, those persons living at Kalaupapa who chose to do so could remain for the rest of their lives. However, dehumanizing medical rules and regulations regarding physical contact with Kalaupapa residents persisted even into the 1980s despite the discovery of curing sulfone drugs. Myobacterium leprae was most likely brought to the island by Westerners, despite accusations of the Chinese plantation workers.In 1886, Molokai Leprosy Hospital reported that missionaries recognized leprosy as early as 1823 prior to any Chinese immigration. A physician also recognized similar symptoms in 1840, which was still before Chinese laborers came to Hawaii. The Chinese were able to recognize the disease because they had seen it in China, but they were not the ones to bring it to the island. It was most likely a Westerner, since the Hawaiians did not recognize the disease and there was no documentation of Hansen’s disease among the Hawaiian prior to the arrival of Westerners. In addition, between 1866-1885, of the 3076 patients, 2997 were Native Hawaiian, 57 European, and 22 Chinese. Louisiana In 1884, the Louisiana legislature established a State Board of Leprosy Control, as there were numerous cases in the state. The strain here was associated with the history of the slave trade from West Africa. In 1917 the US Congress passed a bill to create a national leprosarium, which was built in Carville, Louisiana and run by the Public Health Service, today known as the National Hansen's Disease Museum. In 1941, patient Stanley Stein founded a journal, The Star, to combat leprosy stigma. Researchers in the 1940s at the U.S. National Leprosarium proved the clinical effectiveness of the intravenous sulfone, Promin, the first widely effective treatment for the disease. It was used both to cure leprosy and mitigate the damage it caused. In the late twentieth century, researchers developed multidrug therapy (MDT) to offset antibiotic resistance developing in the disease bacterium. Patients' relatives and leprosarium workers Because of associated ideas about heredity and contagion, children and families of persons with leprosy also suffered stigma. Studies found that only about 5% of spouses living with persons with the disease contracted it, making it clear that leprosy was not highly contagious. Factors contributing to leprosy stigma Biblical References In The Book of Leviticus, Leviticus 13 states \\"But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days.” General public's misconceptions The general public still has misconceptions about leprosy, with persistent beliefs that it is highly contagious. In the twenty-first century, agencies such as The Leprosy Mission campaign to end these misconceptions and work to educate people about leprosy, its causes, and how it is transmitted. They want people with the disease to be identified so they can be treated and limit the physical damage, as well as control contagion. In the twenty-first century, effective, free treatment of dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine was available through WHO. However, in many parts of the world, lay people still believe the disease to be incurable. The multi-drug therapy provided free to countries where the disease is endemic provides a reliable cure for leprosy. The misconception also stems from the discontinuity between science and government policy. Although the medical community has agreed for decades that Hansen’s disease is only mildly contagious, it still remains on the list of \\"communicable diseases of public health significance\\" for health-related grounds of inadmissibility on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website, even though HIV was removed in 2010. As of 2018, Hansen’s disease is still listed as a \\"communicable disease of public significance,\\" and therefore, screened for as part of the immigration medical exam. Leprosaria Lazar hospitals, leprosaria, and colonies were built to quarantine persons with leprosy and associated with its stigma. Some of the leprosaria and colonies are situated in remote lands or islands. The Press In the past, the press contributed to leprosy stigma, reflecting social values in many areas. On the May 7, 2007 Lou Dobb's Tonight program, Madeleline Cosman, a scholar and lawyer--not physician, falsely stated \\"there have been 7000 cases in the past 3 years.\\" In a later interview with 60 Minutes, Dobbs was questioned about the 7000 cases in 3 years figure but said, \\"If we reported it, it’s a fact.\\" On the contrary, The National Hansen’s Disease Programme represented this number in 30 years—not 3 years. Although Dobbs admitted the mistake in a later New York Times article, the ramifications of the false statement persisted. In 2012, leprosy support organisations successfully lobbied Aardman Animations to have a scene from The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists, removed due to concerns about the image it portrayed. The scene involved a \\"leper ship\\", and a leprosy sufferer whose arm falls off during the scene. As there are already many myths surrounding leprosy, advocates working to end stigma believed that this scene was unhelpful. Aardman agreed to remove it. Some argued that the joke was harmless and should have been retained. Campaigns against leprosy stigma The Star Stanley Stein, a blind patient at the national leprosarium at Carville, started The Star, a crusading international magazine against leprosy stigma. The journal raised awareness of facts about Hansen's Disease.

The United Nations Since 1995, WHO has supported the eradication of Hansen’s disease through the administration of free multi-drug treatment worldwide and the promotion of education of Hansen’s disease to erase stigma towards Hansen’s. Although the goal for the complete eradication of leprosy in 2020 seems infeasible for “zero patients” due to the long period of M. leprae dormancy, the WHO has shifted towards a “Final Push” Strategy focusing on early detection to reduce disabilities. Moreover, most patients do not die from leprosy but from other diseases and complication—not the bacteria infection itself. In addition, people may survive for many years but still have leprosy or survive with disabilities. In June 2015, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members. The Human Rights Council voted to establish the mandate of a Special Rapporteur on the issue in June 2017 for a period of three years. Subsequently in November 2017 Ms. Alice Cruz of Portugal was appointed as the UN Special Rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members. On 16 August 2018, Ms. Alice Cruz issued a statement saying that, “The use of leprosy as a pejorative metaphor derives from long-lasting stigmatising connotations produced by different cultural traditions, social rules and legal frameworks,.. Using it as a metaphor leads to wrongful stereotyping that fuels public stigma, everyday discrimination, and impairs the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons affected and their families,” Examples of politicians who made reference to leprosy while referring to opposition parties, the statement stresses are the Portuguese Prime Minister, António Costa, and the Bangladeshi Shipping Minister, Shajahan Khan. Museums National Hansen's Disease Museum (Japan) in Tokyo, Japan is a representative museum showing the history of leprosy in Japan, for the eradication of leprosy stigma. It is situated next to the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium. Smaller museums are associated with other sanatoriums in Japan, such as in Tohoku Shinseien Sanatorium, Kuryu Rakusen-en Sanatorium, Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium and Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium. The National Hansen's Disease Museum in Carville, Louisiana collects, preserves and interprets the medical and cultural artifacts of the Carville Historic District. It promotes the understanding, identification and treatment of Hansen's Disease (leprosy) by creating and maintaining museum displays, traveling exhibits, publications and a Web site in order to educate and inform the public.The National Hansen's Disease Museum. http://www.hrsa.gov/hansensdisease/museum/index.html Retrieved 6 February 2012. Delete the L Word/ Don't Call Me a Leper The Leprosy Mission international advocates for the end of the use of the term \\"leper\\" to describe a person with leprosy. The term has negative connotations for sufferers and, because of many historical references, has long been used to identify someone as \\"unclean\\" in a ritual sense, or who should not be touched or associated with. TLM England and Wales launched their \\"Don't Call Me A Leper\\" campaign in 2010, whilst TLM Scotland launched \\"Delete the L Word,\\" in 2012. Both organisations have noted that the word \\"leper, is derogatory, ostracizing and outdated.\\" They advocate for the use of the term \\"people/person with leprosy.\\" For those undergoing treatment, \\"leprosy patient\\" would also be acceptable. TLM have regularly contacted the press to discourage the use of the word \\"leper\\", and have successfully lobbied the BBC to have it added to guidance for words which should not be used.

Chartered in 1856, Soule replaced the male department of Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute and was intended to succeed the failed Rutersville College. Soule University was named after Bishop Joshua Soule.Soule University Handbook of Texas The female department became an independent institution, Chappell Hill Female College, eventually outliving Soule and acquiring its campus.Chappell Hill Female College Handbook of Texas History Soule University began as 'Chappell Hill Institute', a private preparatory school informally established during or before 1850. The school was chartered by the Texas Legislature in 1852 as a non-denominational preparatory school under the name Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute. That same year, Philander S. Ruter, son of Methodist missionary Martin Ruter, was elected president of the school. In 1854, Chappell Hill's charter was amended to affiliate the school with the Methodist Church.Jones, William B. (2006). To Survive and Excel: The Story of Southwestern University. The Methodists had been seeking a replacement for the financially unstable and scandal-ridden Rutersville College and identified Chappell Hill as the site for a new institution of higher education. The Methodist Church took great pains to ensure the new school was under the authority of the Methodist Church, attributing some of Rutersville College's failures to the school's independent legal status. In 1856, Soule University was chartered as a Methodist-affiliated university and all students in the male department of Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute were transferred into Soule's preparatory department. Classes began in September 1856 with seven academic departments. Originally located in the former buildings of Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute, the university built a new building on donated land in 1858 to separate itself from Chappell Hill Female College. Soule closed in 1861 at the start of the American Civil War with most students joining the Confederate States Army. During the war, the Confederacy used Soule's campus as a hospital. When the university reopened in 1865, the classrooms and library had been badly damaged and most of the school equipment had been lost. The economy of the Chappell Hill area was devastated after the war, limiting the university's sources of funding. When an outbreak of yellow fever in Chappell Hill grew into two epidemics, Soule's student population dropped precipitously and never recovered. In an effort to broaden the university's reach, Soule opened Texas' first medical school in 1865. The school, located in Galveston, was self-sustaining and eventually severed connections with Soule to become the Texas Medical College and Hospital, now the University of Texas Medical Branch. The epidemics combined with financial troubles led Soule University president Francis Asbury Mood to petition the Methodist Church to found a new “central university for Methodism” with the full backing of all five Methodist conferences in Texas. The resulting school, originally named Texas University but chartered as Southwestern University, assumed the role for which the Methodist Church had founded Soule. The Church declared Southwestern to be Soule's successor in 1873 and the Texas Legislature transferred Soule's charter to Southwestern in 1875. Local supporters in Chappell Hill kept Soule open for over a decade after the school's charter was transferred to Southwestern. By 1873, Soule had paid off all debts and was seeking to start a law school in another city, despite recently releasing its neglected medical school in Galveston. The university was renamed Soule College in 1878, but enrollment continued to decrease until only 29 students remained in 1887. In that year, Soule approached Southwestern with a proposal that Soule become a correlated school of Southwestern. The proposal was rejected. Soule University closed in 1887. Soule's campus was used by Chappell Hill Female College until it closed in 1912. Student life The university was home to at least two literary societies, the Alpha Society and the Adelphi Society. A chapter of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity was chartered in 1861 before the university closed at the start of the Civil War. The chapter disbanded in 1866 when returning members of the fraternity transferred to Washington and Lee University.Blackstock, Towner. The Lost Chapter at Soule University.

The building lies outside the confines of Vatican City at the south-eastern corner of the city-state. It is one of the properties of the Holy See in Italy regulated by the 1929 Lateran Treaty signed with the Kingdom of Italy. As such, it has extraterritorial status. The palace was first built after 1514 for Cardinal Lorenzo Pucci, and it was called Palazzo Pucci. Its façade was rebuilt in 1524–25 by the architects Giuliano Leni, Pietro Roselli and even Michelangelo. When Pucci died in 1531, the building was still not fully completed. In 1566–67, the palace was purchased by Pope Pius V for 9000 scudi, and it was converted into the seat of the Holy Office. Renovation works were undertaken by Pirro Ligorio and Giovanni Sallustio Peruzzi. A complete renovation of the building was made by Pietro Guidi between 1921 and 1925. It is where Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI) worked as Prefect of the Congregation.

Plot After a wild night out, a teenage girl named Jordan (Anna Attanasio) is brought to Princeton Plainsboro with severely swollen appendages. The team must work to diagnose Jordan, who is less than honest about what happened the night she fell ill. House suspects she is suffering from rhabdo and the fall caused crushed muscles which released toxins that caused swollen joints. But the CT shows no signs of trauma, so House goes in and gets Jordan to pretend to play the drums. Her hands are very weak. House notes that her chart shows low potassium, and rhabdo elevates potassium levels, meaning her potassium had to be extremely low the previous night. This means she can't have climbed stairs, meaning there was no fall. House says something else is causing her low potassium and rhabdo. Meanwhile, Cuddy, Wilson, and House spend a weekend away from the hospital to attend a medical conference. During an 80s party at the convention, House and Cuddy are dancing and talk about their past at Michigan. They mention how they first met, and the night they slept together. House tells her that the next morning he was going to see her and see where things would go from there, but he got a call from the Dean of his first medical school and found out that he was expelled. After that he didn't see any point to go see her. She leaves him in a haste and later lets him know through Wilson that now she is a mom and she needs someone reliable. When House in turn offers Cuddy to babysit he finds out that she is dating the private investigator Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston) from season five, who is taking care of Cuddy's daughter in place of the babysitter. Jordan's friend, Phoebe, tells Cameron and Chase what they did the previous night, stating they followed comic book creator Jeffrey Keener (Marcus Giamatti), including going to a restaurant in the building. The food makes Foreman suspect she could be bulimic, which would account for all her symptoms, so Cameron starts her on nutrition supplements and they do a barium swallow to check for mallory weiss tears. However the barium swallow shows no tears, ruling out bulimia. During this test, she has cardiac tamponade - she bleeds around her heart. The team puts her on antiarrythmics. House notes that since her blood pressure dropped during the barium swallow, it can't be a chronic condition. Foreman notes that this leaves just infections and toxins. As Jordan's condition worsens, she becomes unable to distinguish fact from fiction. Foreman finds this is caused by a bleed in her brain that's affecting her thalamus causing her to lie. Phoebe tells Foreman that he's been told all the places they went. She says the only time they weren't together was when Jordan went to get ice. However, Phoebe only woke when Jordan returned, so the team has no idea what Jordan really did, or how long she was gone for. CCTV tapes show she was gone for only five minutes, and she returned from her trip holding Keener's journal. Cameron and Chase go to Keener's room and ask to search his room for toxins, but he insists she never arrived at his room. This causes Cameron to suspect that Jordan may have been drugged by roofies and raped by Keener. They start her on flumazenil to reduce the effect. She soon starts to bleed behind her kidneys, so Foreman gives her blood transfusions. Cameron notices that this is similar to a toxic reaction, so they need to find out what toxin is causing it. Cameron suggests drugging her with amobarbital to suppress her thalamus. However, she continues to lie even on the amobarbital. She starts losing blood faster than the team can transfuse. An online search done by Cameron shows that Keener travels with his dog so they treat her for rickettsia. At the medical conference, Wilson feels remorse after having performed euthanasia on a terminally ill cancer patient by intentionally having told the sequence to the patient's PCA machine to a coworker loud enough for the patient himself to hear, allowing the patient to administer himself a morphine overdose. Wilson plans to give a speech about the incident, although it may severely harm his career. However, House drugs Wilson and makes his speech during the convention in another person's name (instead of Gregory House or James Wilson, House goes by the name Phillip Perlmutter for the whole medical conference). While arguing about this, House has an epiphany about Jordan's condition. It turns out that Jordan has vibrio vulnificus caused by the vibrio in the oysters Jordan had the previous night. She has hemochromatosis, which gave her a unique susceptibility to vibrio, which was what caused her swollen joints. However, this got attributed to bulimia so she got supplements that had iron in them. The iron stressed her liver, causing the bleeding. This led to more blood transfusions, giving her more blood, causing even more bleeding. The team starts Jordan on high-dose ceftazidime for the vibrio and chelate for the hemochromatosis. Jordan also admits that she never plucked up the courage to knock on Keener's door, so she left his notebook on his doormat. Keener never lied. Later, Wilson also admits that it was irrational to sacrifice his career because of his remorse and thanks House for being a good friend. Towards the end of the episode, Chase confesses to Cameron that he killed Dibala. The episode ends as Cameron reacts in shock. Trivia This episode reveals how House and Cuddy first met.
