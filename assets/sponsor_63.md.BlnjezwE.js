The processes used depend on the temperature reached and range from fusing and slumping to casting. \\"Warm glass\\" is in contrast to the many cold-working glass processes, such as leaded glass. \\"Hot glass\\", glassblowing, or lampworking is the working of glass in a direct flame, such as for laboratory glassware and beadmaking. Processes Warm glass working uses a variety of processes, according to the working temperature and the time the glass spends at this temperature. The glass becomes progressively softer, less rigid, and less viscous with increasing temperature. Kiln-worked glass (unlike lamp working) responds slowly though, and so the amount by which this affects the glass depends on the time it spends at working temperature. There are three main processes, with variations within them. The broad process depends on the temperature, the variation within it depends on the time and also on slight variations of temperature. These processes are: *Fusing, in which the glass retains its shape, but becomes sticky and adjacent glass pieces join together *Slumping, in which the glass deforms in shape, becoming flexible but still retaining its approximate solid form *Casting, in which the glass melts, becoming a viscous liquid that takes its shape from its containing mould It is common for one piece to use several of these processes in turn. Coloured glass may be fused together to make a composite multi-coloured sheet. This glass is then cut cold and re-assembled in pieces, which are then fused back together. The piece is finally slumped into a mould to shape it. Glass is usually worked for only one process in a heating cycle. Where a piece requires multiple cycles, it is returned to a lower temperature between them. Fusing Fused glass platter Fusing is the use of heat to join the glass by fusion welding, either with or without an associated change in shape, depending on the temperature.  Tack fusing  Tack fusing is the joining together of glass, with as little change to the shape of the pieces as possible. Tack fusing may be used either decoratively, or to assemble a large piece of glass from laminations. Where tack fusing is used to apply small decorative details to a larger piece, it is often desired to partially melt the small pieces so that they change shape (usually becoming more spherical, under the influence of surface tension), but without changing the shape of the carrier piece. This can be done by using an increased temperature, but only briefly. The large piece, of large thermal mass, heats up more slowly than the small decorations. Full fusing Full fusing is like tack fusing, but the temperature is higher so that the fused pieces begin to coalesce. In the complete case, decorative additions to a surface are absorbed entirely into it and the surface becomes flat again. It is usually done for decorative effect. Slumping Platter, slumped into a shallow mould Slumped glass is heated to the temperature at which the glass softens and begins to deform. It may either bend along a single curvature or, if heated sufficiently, may become elastic enough to stretch and curve to follow a compound curvature, such as a bowl. Mould slumping Mould slumping begins with a sheet of flat glass placed above a ceramic mould. When heated, the glass slumps into the mould under its own weight. These moulds are usually commercially made and are offered in a range of standard shapes and sizes: bowls, trays etc. For custom pieces, a glass worker may also make a specialised or temporary mould as a one-off. To avoid trapped air, the mould is perforated with a small vent hole. The hot glass otherwise forms a good seal with the lip of the mould and an air bubble is trapped. Such a trapped bubble often causes problems - when cooling this air may contract to form a partial vacuum that is enough to break the glass. As the glass is not heated enough to become liquid, this air cannot escape as bubbles and so venting is required. Kiln wash is used beforehand, to prevent the glass sticking to the mould. Free fall slumping A mould for free-fall slumping is in the form of a ring with a central opening. When heated, the glass falls through this opening and forms a bowl. Depending on the temperature and time, this bowl may be shallow or deep. If a kiln shelf is placed beneath the ring mould, this catches the falling glass and gives a vessel with a flat base. Free-fall slumping is used to make taller vessels with steeper sides, such as vases. Draping Draping is a variety of free-fall slumping, where the mould former is placed in the centre of the piece and the outer edge falls under the heat. As this outer edge is unconstrained, it tends to fall in large folds. The edge is thus highly uneven, although a carefully draped piece may still retain perfect symmetry. For this reason draped pieces are often used as vases or wavey-edged bowls, but are difficult to use as a more functional vessel. Draped pieces are sometimes sawn down and smoothed when cold, so as to reduce the unevenness of their edge. Casting Cast bowl Casting is the process where the glass begins to melt and behave as a liquid. Its shape is now constrained entirely by the mould and the previous shape is lost. Glass is viscous though and unlike metal casting, the soft glass does not flow through the mould. Variations in the glass are thus preserved in the final piece, so colours and inclusions present beforehand may still remain in the cast item. Glass may be cast from either billets (solid ingots), sheet, loosely stacked pieces of glass (these are usually used with a low-temperature casting, so that their boundaries remain deliberately visible afterwards) or frit, ground or powdered glass. Moulds for casting may be either re-usable ceramic moulds, or else a one-use investment mould of plaster. This mould may in turn have been formed by the lost wax process. P√¢te de verre Three p√¢te de verre vessels P√¢te de verre (literally glass paste) is cast from powdered frit, mixed with a glue binder. This allows the paste to be applied to the sides of a large mould in a thin layer. When fired, a thin-walled vessel is formed. The transparency of the finished casting depends on the size of the frit used: fine powder produces an opaque cast, medium or coarse frit may be used to cast a transparent piece. Other processes Fire polishing In fire polishing, the edges are briefly heated in a flame to smooth and round them. Combing This is one of the few processes that involves manual work on the hot glass while still in the kiln. In a similar manner to slip trailing in ceramics, a pattern is formed on the surface, then trailed into feathers with a pointed metal rake. Firing Warm glass working is similar to that for ceramics, in that a piece is assembled, placed into a cold kiln and then heated through a pre-defined cycle, including a slow cooling phase afterwards. Unlike hot glass, warm glass is rarely worked manually whilst hot. Kilns Contemporary warm glass work is almost universally done in an electrically- heated kiln, although some gas or oil-fired kilns are still used. The reason for this is the extra control accuracy and programmability available with electric heating, as well as their lower capital cost and convenient installation. All kilns for glass work require a pyrometer, usually based on a thermocouple, as knowledge of the kiln temperature is essential for controlling the process. Electric kilns have controllers with a variety of sophistication: the simplest is the \\"Infinity Control\\", a simple open-loop power regulator. As this only controls power, rather than temperature, such a kiln must be manually controlled throughout the cycle. As firing cycles extend over several hours, potentially days for large architectural pieces, automatic unattended control is obviously important. Automatic temperature control uses a PID controller that maintains a constant set temperature. More sophisticated controllers allow the ramp heating and cooling rates to be controlled too, an important factor in glass heating. Controllers dedicated for glass kiln use have their entire heating cycles defined before use with multiple set temperatures, hold times and ramps between them. The most sophisticated controllers of all are dedicated to glass use and allow pre-defined cycles such as \\"Fuse\\" or \\"Slump\\" to be selected from a simple menu, without their operator needing to be aware of the precise temperatures required. Firing cycles Glass' behaviour when heated is highly complex.

Its goals were garnered from in-house formative research and independent summative evaluations, and its first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars in 1968. Sesame Street has both cognitive and affective goals. Initially, its producers and researchers focused on their young viewers' cognitive skills, while addressing their affective skills indirectly, because they believed that focusing on cognitive skills would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. They sought to prepare young children for school, especially children from low- income families. The show's producers used modeling, repetition, and humor to fulfill their goals. They made changes in the show's content to increase their viewers' attention and to increase its appeal. They encouraged \\"co-viewing\\" to entice older children and parents to watch the show by including humor, cultural references, and celebrities. After Sesame Street's first season, its producers and researchers began to address affective goals more overtly. They addressed social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict, which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents. In the 1980s, the show used the real-life experiences of the show's cast and crew, such as the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The show's goals for outreach were addressed during its first season by an extensive and innovative promotional campaign targeted at children and their families in low-income, inner city homes because these groups tended to not watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with them. In subsequent seasons, the producers developed a series of educational materials used in preschool settings. Purpose According to author Malcolm Gladwell, \\"Sesame Street was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them\\".Gladwell, p. 100 Gerald S. Lesser, the first chair of the advisory board of the Children's Television Workshop (the CTW, or \\"the Workshop\\"), the organization that oversaw the show's production, stated that to be effective as an educational tool, television needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention.Lesser, p. 116 Sesame Street was the first children's show that paid attention to the structure of each episode and made \\"small but critical adjustments\\" to each segment to capture children's attention.Gladwell, p. 91 Sesame Street was one of the few children's television programs that utilized a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. The show's goals were garnered from in-house formative research which informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons that measured the program's educational effectiveness. The first curriculum was created in a series of five seminars, led by Lesser and attended by Sesame Street's new creative staff and by educational and child development specialists, in 1968. The participants generated long lists of goals, which the Workshop organized into five categories.Morrow, p. 75 Eventually, these categories were whittled down to four: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, the physical environment, and the social environment. The show's curriculum was eventually restated to identify the writers' goals instead of the child's. Cognitive goals Lesser reported in his 1974 book, Children and Television: Lessons Learned From Sesame Street, written to document the development of the show and the CTW, that one of the goals of the show's creators was \\"the fundamental purpose of preparing children for school\\".Lesser, p. 46 They were aware of the \\"individual suffering and frustration\\"Lesser, p. 47 of the child who was ill- prepared for the demands of school, so they sought to instill in their young viewers an appetite for learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both what and how to think.Lesser, pp. 48‚Äì49 The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three to five-year-old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.Lesser, p. 49 Sesame Street's creators recognized that television lent itself well to the use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well.Lesser, pp. 86‚Äì87 One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning.Morrow, pp. 103‚Äì104 If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.Gikow, p. 161 The creators of Sesame Street believed that young children were easily distracted by peripheral details and were unable to selectively attend to the most useful aspects of what they observed, so they gave special care to, as Lesser put it, \\"make salient what the child is expected to learn\\".Lesser, p. 87 They eliminated irrelevant and distracting content without making the content uninteresting, especially in repeated viewings. The content they presented had to compete with the distractions that occurred as a result of viewing at home, so they realized that the show had to have high appeal. They found, however, that the relationship between appeal and comprehension was more complicated than they initially thought, and discovered that young children probably did not attend to material that was presented at a higher level than they were ready to understand.Truglio & Fisch, p. 235 The Workshop's researchers found that by crafting the show's segments, children's verbal participation and interaction could be increased, which addressed their critics' concerns about children's passivity while watching television.Morrow, p. 104 Repetition was a convention used often on Sesame Street. The creators understood that repetition gave young children opportunities to practice new skills and assisted them in making a connection between new and unfamiliar concepts. They observed that children seemed to enjoy some material more after viewing them several times, and allowed them to predict and anticipate the outcome of a sequence. Repetition made it easier to teach complex concepts or situations a child would not be able to comprehend from a single viewing, and allowed children to explore different facets of a subject.Lesser, p. 107 In the early years of Sesame Street, the producers took advantage of repetition as an effective teaching tool by often repeating the same segment many times during the course of an episode; in the first ten seasons, one in six segments was a repeat of an earlier one. The Workshop also learned that varying the details while repeating the same format was also an effective use of repetition.Morrow, pp. 105‚Äì106 Television historian Robert W. Morrow saw what he called \\"the often repeated alphabet recitation segment\\" as an example of the show's use of repetition. For example, in a short film in which actor James Earl Jones recited the alphabet, Jones made long pauses before each letter, which were superimposed in a corner of the screen moments before he said it. According to Cooney, some educational advisors recommended against using Jones, thinking that he would frighten young viewers, but children ended up loving his segments.Gikow, p. 110 The producers found that children who had seen the segment a few times said the letter before Jones did, and Jones often served as confirmation or correction. The producers viewed this as a way to make television more interactive, and dubbed it \\"the James Earl Jones effect\\".Morrow, pp. 104‚Äì105 Humor was used on Sesame Street to both attract the attention of its young viewers and to, as Lesser put it, \\"entice parents and older siblings to share the young child's viewing\\",Lesser, pp. 119‚Äì120 called \\"coviewing\\" by Truglio and Fisch.Truglio & Fisch, p. 241 Jim Henson's characters and humor were instrumental in creating the show's \\"two-tiered audience\\" of younger and older viewers.Davis, p. 9 Lesser went so far as to state that educational television was \\"completely dependent upon the effective use of humor\\". Lesser also stated that in order for comedy to be an effective teaching tool, it had to coincide with the lesson being taught.Lesser, p. 119 Although critics complained that slapstick was too violent for children's television, the Workshop found that it was the most effective comedy form they used, and as Lesser said, \\"a favorite with preschoolers\\".Lesser, p. 117 Morrow reported that the only violence depicted on Sesame Street was \\"slapstick punctuation\\",Morrow, p. 101 and that it was used only in animations and short films. Another way the Workshop encouraged co-viewing was through the use of cultural references that only adults would understand. Celebrities familiar to adults and older children also appeared on the show. Cooney's previous documentary production experience and producer Dave Connell's \\"wide ranging contacts in the media\\"Gikow, p. 112 resulted in successful bookings of celebrities on the show, even before the show became successful. As of 2009, over 500 celebrities had appeared on Sesame Street. Affective goals At first, the creators of Sesame Street addressed \\"affective goals\\"Morrow, p. 106 indirectly, believing that focusing on cognitive and educational goals would naturally increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. Their viewers' racial identities were addressed by integrating the show with, at first, black and white actors and performers. Eventually their critics during the show's first season forced the Workshop to address affective goals more overtly, which occurred after \\"extensive research and planning\\".Morrow, p. 76 The affective goals they addressed were social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict, which was depicted through interpersonal disputes among its residents, making Sesame Street an \\"idealized place of child empowerment\\".Morrow, p. 98 According to Davis, Sesame Street's curriculum began addressing affective goals more overtly during the 1980s, when the show focused on \\"turning inward, expanding its young viewers' world\\".Davis, p. 277 Davis reported that their affective goals were inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. For example, in one of the show's landmarks, the producers addressed grief after the 1982 death of Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere. In 1985, Sesame Street addressed adoption with Gordon and Susan's adoption of Miles. They emphasized adoption's effect on parenting, family relationships, including sibling rivalry focusing on how Miles' addition affected Big Bird and other Muppet characters, and how he changed his working parents' lives. The Associated Press reported that the show's producers, after \\"extensive research\\", chose not to refer to Miles' biological parents because child development experts thought it might frighten young children. For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when the producers created a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child, Gabi. Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and became pregnant; according to the book Sesame Street Unpaved, published after the show's thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano's real-life experiences gave the show's writers and producers the idea.Borgenicht, p. 80 Research was done before any scripts were written to gain an understanding of the previous studies about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family. The show's research staff found that at the time, there was very little relevant research done about children's understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them.Morrow, p. 74 Studies done after the episodes about Maria's pregnancy aired showed that as a result of watching these episodes, children's understanding of pregnancy increased.Truglio et al., p. 76 Another way Sesame Street addressed affective goals was by addressing real-life disasters.Gikow, p. 165 For example, the producers addressed the September 11 terrorist attacks with an episode that aired in early 2002. They also produced a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These episodes were used in Sesame Workshop's Community Outreach program. Gikow called writer Emily Perl Kingsley an \\"expert\\" at interpreting the show's curriculum goals surrounding tolerance, diversity, and inclusion, especially as it related to the disability community.Gikow, p. 180 Kingsley has been a leader in the Workshop for ensuring that people with disabilities were included in the show. For example, she hired the Little Theater of the Deaf to appear on Sesame Street, and was instrumental in the addition of Deaf actress Linda Bove to its cast. Kingsley's son Jason, who had Down syndrome, also appeared several times on the show.Gikow, pp. 180‚Äì181 As Kingsley reported, \\"...Sesame Street has a better record than any other show in the history of television of doing this on a regular basis in a comfortable kind of way\\".Gikow, p. 181 Outreach Sesame Street focused on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, they needed to encourage all children, no matter what their background, to watch it. At the same time, however, their primary goal was to make the show appealing to inner-city families, a group that did not traditionally watch educational programs on public television.Yotive and Fisch, p. 181Lesser, p. 81 As Lesser stated, \\"If the series did not work for poor children, the entire project would fail\\".Lesser, p. 8 Morrow called the new show's audience \\"concentric\\", with its targeted audience, \\"the urban poor\\", within the larger circle of all preschoolers.Morrow, p. 61 The Workshop devoted 8% of their initial budget to advertise the new show.Lesser, p. 169 In what Morrow called \\"an extensive campaign\\"Morrow, p. 112 that Lesser stated \\"would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research\\",Lesser, p. 39 they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get the word out to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called \\"remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable\\",Davis, p. 154 as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division. After Sesame Street's popularity became established after its first season, the CES' outreach efforts turned from promotion to the development of educational materials used in preschool settings.Yotive and Fisch, pp. 181‚Äì182 The child- care community eventually became the CES' \\"core constituency\\".Yotive and Fisch, p. 182 Early outreach efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps.Gikow, pp. 282‚Äì283 In the early 1980s, the CES developed into the Sesame Street Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the show as an educational resource.Yotive and Fisch, pp. 182‚Äì183 The Workshop's outreach programs included providing materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Instead of following the traditional practice of translating their English materials into Spanish, for example, they employed what they called \\"versioning\\", or creating parallel sets of materials that conveyed the same content and messages in culturally and linguistically relevant ways.Yotive and Fisch, p. 193 Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVD focusing on how military deployment affects the families of soldiers.Gikow, pp. 280‚Äì281 The Workshop's outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.Gikow, pp. 286‚Äì293 In 2013, SW started Sesame Street in Communities, a branch of their outreach efforts. Sesame Street in Communities, working with caregivers and community organizations, provided resources to help families dealing with difficult issues. It provided hundreds of multi-media tools (videos, storybooks, games, activities, and other resources), in both English and Spanish. Its topics included teaching early literacy and math concepts, nutritious eating, divorce, exercise, exploring emotions, grief, divorce, and food insecurity. It got most of its funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and other organizations.

His studies in this field lead him on to hearing and hearing impairments, focusing on communication, disability and the important role that cognitive factors play in hearing. He has studied hearing and its interplay with the signal processing in hearing aids and the capacity of the working memory. The findings improve the possibilities to adapt hearing aids individually. R√∂nnberg has established cognitive hearing science as a new science field.

When more office space was needed, the municipality rented a hotel on Bialik Street, near the home of national poet Chaim Nachman Bialik, which had been built by the Skura family in 1924. The hotel had opened for business in 1925 but was deemed unprofitable due to the lack of tourists. In 1928, the municipality bought the hotel.

Overview In November 1962, the 455th Strategic Missile Wing was the fourth United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM wing, the third with the LGM-30B Minuteman I. In 1962 and 1963 150 missiles were deployed to silos controlled by three squadrons of 455th in North Dakota. On 25 June 1968 the 91st Bombardment Wing was reassigned to Minot AFB from Glasgow AFB, Montana which was closed and assumed control of the three Minuteman squadrons of the 455th. The senior 91st SMW had organizational roots dating from World War II and had been deployed from Glasgow AFB to Southeast Asia, where it had been flying combat missions with the B-52 Stratofortress during the Vietnam War. The 455th SMW was inactivated. Between April 1970 and December 1971 the Minuteman I ICBMs were replaced with the LGM-30G Minuteman III. All of the 91st Wing's Minuteman III missiles were reduced from three warheads to a single warhead by START I between 1991-2001. The three active squadrons are commanded by the 91st Operations Group. Facilities The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) consists of a buried and hardened Launch Control Facility (LCC) and an above-ground Launch Control Support Building (LCSB). MAFs were formerly known as Launch Control Facilities (LCFs) but terminology was changed in 1992 with the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In addition, a MAF has a landing pad for helicopters; a large radio tower; a large \\"top hat\\" HF antenna; a vehicle garage for security vehicles; recreational facilities, and one or two sewage lagoons. The entire site, except for the helicopter pad and sewage lagoons are secured with a fence and security personnel. About a dozen airmen and officers are assigned to a MAF. The underground LCC Launch Control Center (LCC) contains the command and control equipment for missile operations. It is staffed by the two launch officers who have primary control and responsibility for the 10 underground and hardened Launch Facilities (LF)s within its flight which contains the operational missile. Each of the five LCCs also has the ability to command and monitor all 50 LFs within the squadron. The LF is unmanned, except when maintenance and security personnel are needed. A squadron is composed of five flights; flights are denoted by a letter of the alphabet with the facilities controlled by the flight being designated by a number, 01 through 11, with 01 being the MAF.

Overview  PEAS was founded by social entrepreneur John Rendel, a Teach First graduate, after visiting Uganda as a student and discovering the huge need for secondary education following the Ugandan governments' free universal primary education (UPE) policy. A similar trend across African has seen a boost in primary enrolment yet demand for secondary education is largely unmet: only about 23% of girls and 27% of boys are enrolled at secondary level, largely due to a lack of schools. John Rendel, who has won an Unltd Award for Social Entrepreneurship was named in the Courvoisier Future 500 as one of five young leaders in the public and social sectors, founded Promoting Equality in African Schools (PEAS) in 2004 PEAS has teams in the UK, Uganda and Zambia, working to both raise money (in the UK) and implement the PEAS SmartAid approach. As a result, there are currently 22 schools across the PEAS network in Uganda and Zambia, with several new schools under construction, including one in Zambia. The existing PEAS schools are:Our Schools Promoting Equality in African Schools (PEAS) * Onwards and Upwards Secondary School * Forest High School * Sarah Ntiiro High School * Kiira View Secondary School * Green Shoots Secondary School * Lamwo Kuc Ki Gen High School * Hibiscus High School * Pioneer High School  Principles  PEAS is a young UK charity with no religious or political agenda. It is built on the following principles that aim to eliminate the problems experienced by many development organisations around the world. * Sustainability ‚Äì Every PEAS school covers its own running costs through low fees, government subsidies and income generating projects. Even the costs of the PEAS Uganda audit and educational inspection teams in Uganda are funded from excess revenues from the schools. Too many charities create dependency on donor funding and PEAS wants to show how much further money can go when it multiplies rather than undermines the energies of local communities. * Local Ownership ‚Äì Every PEAS school is run by Ugandans for Ugandans with support from UK partners. Each PEAS school has a local Board of Governors. * Avoiding Market Distortions ‚Äì PEAS schools are only built in areas where there is high demand for extra secondary school provision. In many areas, primary school leavers are unable to continue their education. Schools are marketed to those in greatest need and PEAS is working to help improve existing affordable schools at the same time as launching more and more within its network. * Collaboration with government ‚Äì PEAS works closely with the Ugandan Ministry of Education and the wider Ugandan government. The success of the schools depends on working within the educational framework laid out by the Ugandan government. In 2011, PEAS engaged further with the Ugandan Government through a Public-Private Partnership: 3 schools have rolled out the Universal Secondary Education (USE) program from the start of 2011. This means that education is free at the point of use for the student, thus expanding access to education to those otherwise unable to afford it. * Transparency ‚Äì PEAS never gives or receives bribes. This transparency is upheld through clear accounting and all PEAS annual accounts are available on their website for public perusal.  Values  PEAS emphasises certain values that form the basis of their approach to education and schools: * Equal access ‚Äì PEAS schools are open to all students irrespective of ability and personal characteristics. PEAS schools never discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, religion, gender, physical disability or primary school performance. * Personal security ‚Äì PEAS schools are safe places that work to instill positive behavioural management systems, which help Ugandan staff move away from the use of corporal punishment. PEAS carries out risk assessment inspections in all the schools. * Relevant learning ‚Äì As a minimum, PEAS schools guarantee that students leave with literacy, numeracy, and at least one vocational skill. The latter is emphasised through Income Generating Projects such as bee-keeping and brick-making. * Professional development ‚Äì Through extensive inspection and reciprocal lesson observation, PEAS embeds student-centred learning and professional accountability where staff are responsible for their own success. PEAS Uganda implements this PEAS vision, supporting each individual school. A Director of Finance financially audits every school, every term, to ensure efficiency and accountability. The Director of Educational Excellence inspects every school, every year, in order to maintain and improve teaching standards to help students learn more. Teachers benefit from continuous professional development, and salaries paid in full, on time, every month, which is a practice still rare in Uganda. PEAS recently held its first annual teachers conference in Kampala, Uganda, bringing together teachers from across the PEAS network to share experiences and lesson. PEAS also promotes opportunities for the students to practice the skills they have learned, such as through a public speaking competition.  A unique approach to aid  All PEAS schools operate a SmartAid model, a sustainable way of giving aid that prioritises local ownership and long-term sustainability. The SmartAid model means that PEAS fundraises the capital for the building and start-up costs of a school. As a result, a PEAS school is able to open debt- free, allowing it to charge fees that are low because they merely need to cover the running costs of the school. The income from the low fees is supplemented by income-generating projects (which also teach the students important business and vocational skills). PEAS schools typically become financially self-sustaining within a year of opening, allowing them to run independently of UK fundraising, which is the key to sustainable development. This means that funds raised by the PEAS team in the UK can be spent on creating even more new schools allowing PEAS to provide thousands and thousands of new secondary school places for young people.  Bridges to Africa  Bridges to Africa is a national sponsored walk organised by PEAS, involving students from schools across London and the UK that has been running since 2006. Students join together to complete 10 km bridge walks in London, Manchester and Birmingham. The money raised by students is used to help build new affordable secondary schools in Uganda and Zambia through the charity. In the past, the event has been attended by then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and Channel 4 new presenter Jon Snow. The walk takes place yearly, in May. Over 5000 students have walked the bridges of the UK in the past years, helping to raise ¬£100,000.

The next day, they continued their march to Valkeala, where a Russian force of 3000 men stood ready to face them. The Swedish force available for battle consisted of roughly 3000 men, since 3 battalions had been diverted to guard the ford crossing and rear positions.

The station was opened in 1859 by the Austrian Empire's S√ºdbahn and transferred to Italy in 1919. Rovereto station is located on the trans-Alpine Brenner Railway connecting Verona and Innsbruck. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). The commercial area of the passenger building, however, is managed by Centostazioni, whereas train services are operated by Trenitalia and √ñBB-DB. Location Rovereto railway station is situated at Piazzale Paolo Orsi, the western edge and a five-minute walk to the city centre. History The station was opened on 23 March 1859 upon the completion of the Trento-Ala section of the Brenner Railway. Initial train operations were entrusted to the Austrian Empire's S√ºdbahn (Imperial Royal Privileged Southern Railway Company of Austria, Venice and Central Italy / ). After Austria-Hungary's defeat in the First World War, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) rewarded Italy with annexation of County of Tyrol's territory south of the Brenner Pass. Ownership of all railway stations from Ala/Ahl-am-Etsch to Brenner, including Rovereto, were consequently transferred to Ferrovie dello Stato (FS). Features The station yard The station has three tracks with platforms for passenger trains and additional tracks in the goods yard, which can be accessed by trucks and other vehicles from Via Zeni on the opposite side of the station building. There have been plans to transfer the goods yard southwards to Mori _railway_ aistation to make room for a larger, bifrontal station, thus providing access on both sides from Piazzale Orsi and Via Zeni. Train services The station has about two million passenger movements per year and is therefore, in terms of passenger numbers, the third biggest within the region, after Bolzano/Bozen and Trento.

Life Greatheed was born on 19 October 1759, the son of the MP Samuel Greatheed of Guy's Cliffe, near Warwick, and his wife Lady Mary Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster.historyofparliamentonline.org, Greatheed, Samuel (c.1710-65), of Guy's Cliffe, nr. Warwick. After the deaths of his parents, he inherited Guy's Cliffe Estate in Warwick, which had been bought by his father, and the Canaries plantation on St Kitts near the capital, Basseterre, which had been established by his grandfather, John Greatheed. He also inherited land in Lincolnshire through his mother's family. The majority of his income in his earlier life came from the St Kitts plantation, although he also had some income from his land holdings in Warwick. He invested his wealth in the development of the Georgian spa town at Leamington Priors, which later became known as Leamington Spa. He owned building plots on the west side of what is now the Parade in Leamington, and was a partner in the Royal Pump Rooms, which was located on five acres of his land. The Canaries plantation was managed on Greatheed's behalf by his uncle Craister until 1772, and then by Richard Greatheed, another family member. In the early 1780s, the estate paid tax on over 230 enslaved people, and in 1788 made profits of ¬£380, which was considered a bad year. Correspondence between Greatheed and his St Kitts plantation managers is now archived at Warwickshire County Record Office, and includes information about the trade of enslaved people, production of sugar and rum and the profits of the estate. Bertie Greatheed supported the abolition of slavery, and described the plantation as his \\"odious property\\", however he continued to own enslaved people. In 1835, his descendants, including Lord Charles Greatheed Bertie Percy, the husband of his granddaughter, received ¬£1,223 6s 7d in compensation after the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Family In 1780, Greatheed married his first cousin, Ann Greatheed, who was born in St Kitts. They had one son, also called Bertie, born in 1781. Greatheed travelled extensively throughout Europe with his family, and resided in Germany, France and Italy. In 1803, they were detained in Paris as prisoners of war, alongside many other British families. The younger Bertie Greatheed was becoming recognised as an artist, and his painting of Napoleon Bonaparte impressed the Emperor's family and probably gave the Greatheed's favourable treatment. Whilst staying in Vicenza in Italy, his son died suddenly of influenza on 8 October 1804, aged 23. Shortly after his son's death, it was revealed he had an illegitimate daughter, Ann Caroline, with a woman in Dresden. Ann Caroline was brought to England by her grandparents and raised at Guys Cliffe. She married Lord Charles Greatheed Bertie Percy, son of Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley on 20 March 1823. Works When residing in Florence he became a member of the society called Gli Oziosi. Greatheed was a contributor to the privately printed collection of fugitive pieces of the Gli Oziosi, the Arno Miscellany (Florence, 1784). The following year he contributed to the Florence Miscellany (Florence, 1785), a collection of poems by the Della-Cruscans. Greatheed was termed by William Gifford the Reuben of the Della-Cruscans, in his satirical Baviad and M√¶viad. A blank verse tragedy by Greatheed, The Regent was brought out at Drury Lane Theatre on 1 April 1788, supported by John Kemble and Mrs. Siddons; it ran for nine nights.

It is located in the eastern coast of the Bolgatty Island (one of the islands part of the city of Kochi), in the premises of the Bolgatty Palace, a 'heritage hotel'. The Kochi Marina is the only international marina in India. It is owned by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation. The marina provides berthing facility for yachts and also offers services like fuel, water, electricity and sewage pump-outs for boats. The marina is close to the international maritime route at the south west coast of the Indian Peninsula, with favourable conditions and minimum tidal variations throughout the year.  General description  The Kochi Marina Jetty The Kochi Marina House Kochi International Marina, Bolgatty Island The Kochi International Marina started operations on 24 April 2010. It is the first full-fledged marina of international standards in India. The Marina is owned and operated by KTDC. It was implemented by KITCO (Formerly Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organisation) for and on behalf of KTDC. Sharjah‚Äôs Hamriyah Free Zone-based Gulf Marinas did the construction under the supervision of KITCO. The Marina is now managed by Mumbai based Ocean Blue. The Kochi Marina houses facility for berthing around 34 yachts. This will be further upgraded to 50 berths. Construction of a three-storey building on the north-eastern side of the Bolghatty Palace hotel to accommodate sailors from across the world is complete. KTDC had spent Rs 8.21 crore on Phase -1 of the project with a central assistance of Rs 4 crore. A two-lane road connecting the main land with the island is also ready. Repair and maintenance facilities for the yachts also available at the Marina. Kochi is an ideal berthing spot for yachts from the West, crossing Suez Canal and travelling towards the north eastern parts of Asia. Currently, there are no intermediate berthing facilities for yachts leaving Dubai until they reach their destinations in the Far East. Situated just 11 nautical miles from the international maritime route, Kochi has one of the best natural ports in Asia where Dubai Ports World is building an international container transshipment terminal. Kochi recently became a touching place of Luxury cruise lines. During the last one decade, Kochi had become a major destination for sea-based adventure tourism. On an average 100 yachts visit Kochi every year of which majority is from European countries such as the United Kingdom, Finland and Norway apart from New Zealand and Australia. The Cochin Port Trust is also building a cruise terminal on the nearby Willington Island. Since Kochi is the nearest port on the international maritime route between the west and the east more adventurous seafarers prefer this port.  Facilities  The marina will have facilities to repair yachts and for filling fuel and food items. Facilities like golf course, swimming pool, spa, health club, restaurant and beer parlour will also be provided for the sailors. Floating docks built on concrete beams is the major attraction of the project. A board walk - wooden structure protruding into the back waters in order to facilitate other tourists to see the yachts has also been arranged. Additional 16 docks would be added in the next phase and additional facilities would be provided on 2 acres of reclaimed land adjacent to the island. Marina House Marina House, built in the traditional Kerala architectural style, is an essential part of Kochi International Marina that serves as a station for vessels to refuel and to replenish their stores. Besides, the Marina House also provides 24 deluxe rooms including 4 suite rooms, a recreation centre and cafeteria, will be managed by Tourists ResortsKerala Limited, a subsidiary of KTDC .

Family du Rietz was the son of lieutenant-colonel Carl Magnus du Rietz and his wife countess Ebba Katarina Horn. Ebba Katarina was the daughter of Henning Rudolf Horn and his wife Helena Sperling. Life du Rietz began his military career as a lieutenant in the Life Guards and was sent to the Finnish front in the Russo-Swedish War (1741‚Äì1743) with that regiment. After that war he rose slowly through the officer ranks, reaching major in the S√∂dermanland Regiment, and then went to join the Pomeranian War in north Germany from 1758 to 1760. He won distinction in this war, capturing the Anclamen Feler fort, protecting the Swedish siege of Peenem√ºnde and obtaining the advantageous capitulation of the Prussian forces at Demmin by Field Marshal Johann von Lehwaldt. From 1760 onwards he concentrated more on politics, becoming an outstanding member of the Caps faction and elected to the 'secret committee' in 1760 and 1765. He was not, however, in the Riksr√•d, although he was nominated to it. During this political career he was also promoted to colonel and to become head of the H√§lsinge Regiment, and shortly afterwards was sent to bear the Swedish official congratulations on Catherine II of Russia's accession. In 1770 he was made major general and in 1772 governor of Gothenburg. He managed to retain his post as governor after Gustav III's coup d'√©tat and managed to make his peace both with Gustav III and the prevailing new order. As a reward he was in 1776 appointed lieutenant general and in 1778 promoted to the nobility as a count. Towards the end of his life, he was suspected of laziness in the defence of Gothenburg during the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì1790), though Gustav III arrived in time to save the city.

Designed by Netto in 1880. Curt Adolph Netto (August 21, 1847 ‚Äì February 7, 1909) was a German metallurgist and educator. He is regarded as a precursor for the industrial utilization of aluminium. He was active in early Meiji period Japan. Biography Netto was born in Freiberg, Saxony, where his father, Gustav Adolph Netto was a mining official. As a youth, he relocated with his family to Schneeberg, Saxony, but returned to Freiberg by 1860. He enrolled in the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology in 1864. He left school in 1869, and volunteered for the military, joining the mountain troops corps. He saw combat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, and was decorated with the Iron Cross (second class). After the war, in 1871, he obtained a job as a chemist working with enamels at the workshop of Ernst August Geitner. In 1873, he was recruited by the Japanese government as a foreign advisor and was placed in charge of modernizing the Kosaka mines, a lead, copper and zinc mine at Kosaka, Akita in northern Honshu. He was one of the co-founders of the German Society of Natural History and Ethnology of Asia (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Natur- und V√∂lkerkunde Ostasiens). The mines were privatized in 1877, and Netto travelled to Tokyo, where he obtained a job as a lecturer on metallurgy at Tokyo Imperial University in 1878. He took a one- year sabbatical leave from 1882 to 1883 for research in Europe, Mexico and the United States. In June 1885, Emperor Meiji conferred upon him the Order of the Rising Sun. Netto's contract with Tokyo Imperial University expired in November 1885, and he returned to Germany in 1886. However, soon after his return, he was forced to sell much of his large collection of Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints as he lost all of his savings in a bank failure. After briefly working in Paris, Netto obtained a job with Krupp from 1887‚Äì1889, where he invented a new patented process to produce aluminium by the sodium reduction of cryolite. The revolutionary new process promised to drastically reduce production costs for aluminium, which until that point had been valued more highly than gold due to its scarcity and difficulty to produce. However, Netto's process was quickly rendered obsolete by the development of electrolysis smelting. In 1889, on the recommendation of noted chemist Clemens Winkler, Netto accepted a post as head of the technical department of Metallgesellschaft in Frankfurt am Main. Netto married in 1899 and had three children. He retired in 1902 due to health reasons and from 1906 resided at the spa resort of Bad Nauheim in Hesse. He died February 7, 1909, in Frankfurt. Publications Netto published two books from his experiences in Japan: * Papierschmetterlinge aus Japan (Paper Butterflies from Japan). Leipzig: Weigel 1888.

Blues turnaround containing \\"How Dry I Am\\" . The blues turnaround may be \\"dress[ed] up\\" by using V aug (\\"an uptown V7\\") instead of V7 , \\"adding a touch of jazzy sophistication.\\"Johnston, Richard (2007).

Duck Baker's Fingerstyle Blues Guitar 101, p.17. . This is a plagal cadence featuring a dominant seventh tonic (I or V/IV) chord. However, Baker cites a turnaround containing \\"How Dry I Am\\" as the \\"absolutely most commonly used blues turnaround\\". Fischer describes the turnaround as the last two measures of the blues form, or I7 and V7, with variations including I7‚ÄìIV7‚ÄìI7‚ÄìV7.Fischer, Peter (2000). Blues Guitar Rules, p.31. . Analysis The root movement of the V‚àíIV‚àíI cadential formula found in the blues is considered nontraditional from the standpoint of Western harmony. The motion of the V‚àíIV‚àíI cadence has been considered \\"backward,\\" as, in traditional harmony, the subdominant normally prepares for the dominant which then has a strong tendency to resolve to the tonic. However, an alternative analysis has been proposed in which the IV acts to intensify the seventh of V, which is then resolved to the third of the tonic. The V‚ÄìIV‚ÄìI movement has also been characterized as \\"unwinding\\" the V‚ÄìI cadence with the addition of the passing IV.Pedlar, Dominic (2003).

Green was born in the parish of Basinghall, city of London. He was of a wealthy Roman Catholic family, and at the age of sixteen was sent by his parents, 'who favoured learning,' to the University of Oxford, proceeding B.A. in 1547. At the university he was a laborious student, and was converted by Peter Martyr's lectures to the Protestant religion. On leaving Oxford Green entered the Inner Temple, and after a period of dissipation his earlier impressions revived, and he gave up his worldly amusements. His family were scandalised by his Protestantism, and his grandfather, Dr. Bartlet, offered him bribes to abandon it. At Oxford Green had made friends with Christopher Goodman, and on Easter Sunday 1554 took the sacrament with him in London before Goodman went beyond the seas. A letter from Green to Goodman was intercepted in 1555, in which he told his correspondent 'The queen is not dead.' It was read before the Privy Council, and Green was thrown into the Tower of London on a charge of treason, which broke down. He was then examined on religious questions before Bishop Bonner in November 1555. He was again sent back to prison (to Newgate), but was re-examined (15 January 1555-6) before Bonner and John Feckenham and condemned to be burnt. John Foxe gives a detailed account of his martyrdom, and of the letters he wrote before his death. His character seems by all accounts to have been very amiable. A letter from one Careless to him when in prison addresses him as a 'meek and loving lamb of Christ.' He went cheerfully to the stake at Smithfield at 9 a.m. on 27 January. A priest (Thomas Whittle or Whitwell), three tradesmen (Thomas Brown, John Tudson and John Went or Winter or Hunt) and two women (Isobella Forster or Annis Foster and Joan Lushford or Jone Lashforde or Warne) were burnt with him.

The manor includes Byng Hall Lane, Byng Lane, Byng Brook and a considerable amount of the local farmland stretching to the outskirts of Wickham Market.  Ancient history  Historically referred to as Beagingas or Benga/ges, Byng was originally a 6th- century settlement located in Suffolk near Sutton Hoo which formed part of the Kingdom of East Anglia. The place name, Beagingas, means Beagas people. Referred to as Benga/Benges at the time of the survey.  Modern history  Walter de Caen held the manor as tenant-in-chief from Robert Malet's mother. This manor formed part of the Easton Estate once owned by the Earl of Rochford, and later the Dukes of Hamilton. The first historical details of the manor were recorded in the Domesday book which stated prior to the Norman conquest the manor was in the estate of Edric in Edward the Confessor's time, and was held by Robert Malet at the time of the survey. The original manor land in the Domesday Book was recorded as being . No manor apparently existed in Saxon times but Edric held a carucate and a half of land, with 1 villein, 1 bordar, 1 serf, 1 ploughteam, 2 acres of meadow, 1 rouney, 4 beasts, 16 hogs and 80 sheep valued at 20s. In Norman days the value had doubled and there were; 2 bordars, 2 ploughteams. Another portion of land here was held in Saxon times by Godric under commendation to Edric with 40 acres, 1 bordar, and 1 ploughteam valued at 7s, and under him were two freemen with 12 acres and half a ploughteam valued at 2s. The conquest had the effect of making Godric hold of Walter de Caen, who held of Robert Malet as tenant in Chief.The Domesday Book, England's Heritage Then and Now, by Thomas Hinde, Greenwich Editions, 2002. In 1253 Roger de Huntingfield held the manor, which on his death in 1256 went to his widow Joan, who died in 1297, when it passed to her grandson and heir Roger de Huntingfield, son of her son, William de Huntingfield who had died in 1282.

On the same rolls in 1327 is an order to discharge Walter de Norwich of a third of the manor which \\"Sibyl the widow of William de Huntingfield\\" held in dower. Roger de Huntingfield died in 1337, when the manor went to his son and heir, William de Huntingfield who died in 1376 without issue.

Arthur Lake Life In 1626 Greenbury painted a well-known portrait, of Arthur Lake, bishop of Bath and Wells, for New College, Oxford; the college paid ¬£4 for the work. It was exhibited at the National Portrait Exhibition in 1866. In 1625 Greenbury was employed by the East India Company to paint a large picture giving details of the cruelties inflicted on the English by the Dutch at Amboyna. The picture, which is said to have caused the widow of one of the victims to swoon, was intended to inflame popular passion, and was defaced from motives of foreign policy. \\"Robert Greenberry, picture-drawer\\", figures in the lists of recusants returned by the Westminster justices to the crown in 1628. Among the pictures belonging to Charles I was one of 'Diana and Callisto, bigger than life, a copy after Grimberry,' sold to Captain Geere for 22l. This is more probably a copy by Greenbury, as the king also possessed 'Two copies of Albert D√ºrer and his father, which are done by Mr. Greenbury, by the appointment of the Lord Marshall.' John Evelyn in his 'Diary' writes on 24 Oct. 1664: 'Thence to New College, and the painting of Magdalen Chapel, which is on blue cloth in chiar'oscuro, by one Greenborow, being a C≈ìna Domini.' This is no longer in its place, and was probably removed in 1829. Greenbury also painted a picture of William Waynflete, the founder of Magdalen College, Oxford, dated 1638, and one Richard Greenbury in 1632 contracted to supply the chapel there with painted glass. In 1636 Richard Greenbury patented a process for painting with oil colours upon woollen cloth, kerseys, and stuffs for hangings, also on silk for windows.

The second condition is the c.d. Prima facie case. The burden of proof of danger in delay falls to the person who requests the injunction or order, demonstrating the existence of both requirements, periculum notice, and the risk of suffering serious and irreparable damage. The term 'serious harm' refers to the magnitude of the damages, calculated in relation to the value of the property in dispute: an injury will not be so serious in itself, but only when compared to the object of contention. Irreparable damage is in the possibility of a remedy in the future against which the party seeking the injunction believes they will suffer. Only asset orientation is currently supported, in that the prevailing possibility of obtaining compensation for damages is, in itself, sufficient to prevent the founding of irreparable harm.

(1727 or 1728 - February 20th 1793 in Stockholm) was a Swedish portrait painter and copyist. Biography In the early stages of his career, Bj√∂rck is reported to have been a pupil of Johan Henrik Scheffel,Svenskt Biografiskt Lexikon however this is uncertain. He worked in the studio of pastel painter Gustav Lundberg between 1750 and 1774. In 1774, Bj√∂rck married Cicilia Gren (1723 or 1724 - 1811). In Lundberg's studio 1750-1774 Oil copies of Lundberg's pastels are usually attributed to Bj√∂rck, despite several other assistants being employed in the studio at the time: Per Cogell (later a city painter in Lyon), Adolf Hall, Jonas Forsslund and a pastel painter named Pettersson. In addition, Lundberg had so many orders at times that he delegated the copy orders to other artists - Johan Henrik Scheffel and Fredrik Brander. Moreover, it seems that Ulrika Pasch, Olof Arenius, the court miniaturist John George Henrichsen as well as Niklas Lafrensen the Elder all had access to Lundberg's originals.Laine/Brown p. 203 It was well known at the time that pastel paintings are sensitive to light, moisture and touch, wherefore it was common to order oil copies from the outset. An example of this can be seen in the Swedish Count Carl Gustaf Tessin's diaryCarl Gustaf Tessin: √Öker√∂dagboken december 1761, into which he had copied the following receipt from Lundberg: > Un portrait original en pastel de Son Excellence Monseigneur le Comte de > Tessin avec cadre et glace Dlr cuivre 1.300 Un dito de Madame La Comtesse de > Tessin 1.300 Deux copies en huile du Portrait de son Excellence √† 200 d 400 > Deux cadres pour les dites copies 300 Translated from French: > One original portrait in pastel of His Excellence my Lord the Count of > Tessin with frame and glass copper : 1,300 talers One ditto of Madame the > Countess of Tessin : 1,300 Two copies in oil of the Portrait of His > Excellence, at 200 talers each : 400 Two frames for the aforesaid copies : > 300 The portraits being referred to are one of Tessin in a (a formal attire worn by the Privy Council of Sweden) and one of his wife Ulrika Lovisa in a yellow dress and a black lace mantilla. Of the former there are ten copies registered in Svenska Portr√§ttarkivet, all of which are attributed to Bj√∂rck; same goes for four copies of the latter,Index √∂ver svenska portr√§tt which had apparently been ordered at a different time. Bj√∂rck also made pastel copies, but there are no known works which could with certainty be attributed to him.Laine and Brown p. 219 Upon the end of his employment at the studio, Lundberg thanked him with a small cabinet of pastel sticks and a copper plate collection as recognition for \\"24 years of faithful service\\". On his own since 1774 From 1774 Bj√∂rck had his own production, where he mainly copied the works of others, such as one of Jean-Baptiste Oudrys door lintels in the Royal Palace, Hunting dog with two grouse, which he signed Iacob Bj√∂rck px on stent . He was able to paint King Gustav III and the Life Guards uniform with revolutionaries armbandSold for 250.000 SEK at Stockholms Auktionsverk in the Spring of 2010 and partly in Swedish costumeSold for 72.000 SEK at Bukowskis in 1990, both in the magnificent royal frames. In general, however, it is assumed that he copied from the now lost or destroyed works by Lundberg. Bj√∂rck had the title HofCopist, probably at Lundberg's instigation in order to avoid problems with the painting profession.Laine and Brown p. 201 His own style is rough compared to Lundberg's easy elegance. This is evident from the portraits of King Gustav III and Adolf Ludvig Stierneld below in the gallery. Over time, his production became purely artisanal and the copies after the many stereotypical portraits of Lundberg's last days are consistently dry and lifeless.Svensk Biografiskt Lexikon The portraits of Gustavus Gyllenborg, his wife Petronella Hultman and the copy of Lundberg's self-portraits in the below gallery can be seen as an example of this. Bj√∂rck's copies of Lundberg's portraits during the 21st century sold for anything from 20,000 to 180,000 SEK, depending on how decorated the frame was. Child and damportr√§tt were generally valued higher than men's portraits.http://auktionsverket.se/search/?q=Jakob+Bj%C3%B6rck Gallery Image:Jakob Bj√∂rk - Portr√§tt av Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m d.√§.jpg|Portrait of Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m the ElderSold in a magnificent sculpted frame for 180.000 kr at Bukowskis in May 2007 Image:Jakob Bj√∂rck- Portrait of Charlotte Du Rietz af Hedensberg.jpg|Portrait of countess Charlotte Du Rietz af Hedensberg, copy after a pastel by Gustaf Lundberg.Sold for 60.000 SEK at Stockholms Auktionsverk in the Spring of 2010 Image:Jakob Bj√∂rck-Portrait of Anders Rudolf Du Rietz af Hedensberg.jpg|Portrait of count Anders Rudolf Du Rietz af Hedensberg (1720-1792), copy after a pastel by Gustaf Lundberg.Sold f√∂r 57.000 SEK at Stockholms Auktionsverk in June 2010 Image:Jakob Bj√∂rck-Portrait of Adolf Ludvig Stjerneld.jpg|Portrait of Adolf Ludvig Stierneld Sources  *Oscar Levertin; Gustaf Lundberg - en studie (Ljus, Stockholm 1902) * Merit Laine and Carolina Brown; Gustaf Lundberg 1695-1786 (Nationalmuseum 2006) * Boo von Malmborg; Svensk Portr√§ttkonst (Allhems F√∂rlag och Nationalmuseum 1978) * Carl Gustaf Tessin; Dagbok 1760 och 1761 (Handskrift, Kungl.

Adolf Ludvig Stierneld (September 1, 1755 ‚Äì July 31, 1835), was a Swedish baron, politician, courtier and collector of historical documents. Recent historical research has revealed him to be one of Sweden's best and most prolific document forgers. He was born in Stockholm and died in Gripsholm. Life Stierneld was the son of baron Samuel Gustaf Stierneld and Kristina Brigitta Falker. He was inscribed by his father in to the military at birth and became ryttm√§stare at Livregementet in Stockholm in 1781. From 1778, he served as courtier to the queen, Sophia Magdalena. Stierneld appeared among the opposition to Gustav III of Sweden in the Riksdag of 1786 and 1789, where he was one of the leaders of the nobility. During the Riksdag of 1789, he belonged to the members of the noble opposition against the absolutist reform of the Union and Security Act, and consequently belonged to the opposition arrested by the monarch during the Riksdag. When the others arrested were released, however, he was detained because of his connections to the Russian ambassador, and placed in Varberg Fortress. In 1790, he was released in order to marry his fianc√©e Charlotte Gyldenstolpe, a courtier of the royal duchess Charlotte and a daughter of the king's favorite Nils Philip Gyldenstolpe: the connections of his spouse secured his rehabilitation, and he was appointed court chamberlain in 1792. Through his position as governor of Gripsholm Castle, Stierneld started the collection of portraits at the castle which was eventually to become the National Portrait Gallery (Sweden); he started and organized the collection after the death of Gustav III in 1792, and the collection became officially inaugurated in 1822. He became an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities in 1821. In his capacity as director of the museum collection, however, he reportedly misidentified several portraits.Ingemar Carlsson: P√• l√∂gnens v√§g - historiska bedr√§gerier och dokumentf√∂rfalskningar (Lund 1999) During his later life, Stierneld was also a collector of historical documents. In 1821, he became one of the founders of the Kungliga Samfundet f√∂r utgivande av handskrifter r√∂rande Skandinaviens historia (Royal Publication Society of Documents of the History of Scandinavia), in which he served as chairperson several times and also published several essays. In this capacity, he forged, misquoted, manipulated and wrongly interpenetrated numerous historical documents in order to trace the genealogy of his own family to royalty and give his ancestors a more prominent place in history.Ingemar Carlsson: P√• l√∂gnens v√§g - historiska bedr√§gerier och dokumentf√∂rfalskningar (Lund 1999) His perhaps most known forgery was the fictions person Brita Persdotter Karth.

Since its inception it has released records by artists such as Dana Gavanski, Timber Timbre, Tunng, Micah P. Hinson, Michael Nau, Katie Von Schleicher and White Denim. History Full Time Hobby came into life in 2004, set up by Nigel Adams and Wez. They had met at Mushroom Records / Infectious Records and decided to start a label when it was clear that Mushroom was going to be sell out to Warner Brothers. Inspired by labels like the original Jac Holzman era Elektra Records, Creation Records and Rough Trade Records they wanted to start a label that championed original and creative new music that they loved and did not see finding a home elsewhere. The first release as Full Time Hobby was the EP Alive With Pleasure by Portland, Oregon based duo Viva Voce who went on to release another two albums and a compilation for the label. In 2005 the label made a pivotal signing with the band Tunng who they had known through their involvement with Full Time Hobby's Tim & Jeff Buckley inspired compilation Dream Brother. Tunng have so far released three albums for the label as well as spawning side projects The Accidental, formed by Tunng co-founder Sam Genders alongside Stephen Cracknall, Liam Bailey and Hannah Caughlin and the soon to be released side project of co-founder Mike Lindsay titled Cheek Mountain Thief. Sam Genders left Tunng in 2008 and has since gone on to form a new act, Diagrams, signed to Full Time Hobby in 2011. In 2006, FTH started working with The Hold Steady through a connection with Vagrant Records. They went on to release the band's third album Boys and Girls in America, followed shortly by the re-release of the band's first two albums, Almost Killed Me and Separation Sunday, via a license an agreement with US label Frenchkiss Records. 2007 saw Full Time Hobby sign White Denim, a then unknown Texan trio, having been sent demos by the band's manager. They went on to work with the band on the debut album Workout Holiday released in 2008 prior to any US release and follow up album Fits a year later. The Leisure Society signed with the label in 2009, and the label promptly re-issued their debut album The Sleeper, feted with two Ivor Novello Awards nominations. This was followed in 2011 by the release of their second album Into The Murky Water. Album releases in 2012 included a new record from Diagrams, with their debut album Black Light. Danish band Pinkunoizu released their debut Free Time in March 2012 and Canadian indie- garage heads Hooded Fang with their album Tosta Mista. 2013 saw the label release an album of covers of the late singer/songwriter Tim Hardin. Entitled Reason to Believe, The Songs of Tim Hardin, it features covers from Full Time Hobby artists such as Diagrams and Pinkunoizu, and other covers from Mark Lanegan, Okkervil River and The Phoenix Foundation. Further releases for 2013 saw a new album from The Leisure Society entitled 'Alone Aboard the Ark' on 1 April. Hooded Fang and Tunng also released albums in the same year. In 2014 the label released \\"Hot Dreams\\" by Canadian act Timber Timbre. The Guardian awarded the album five stars, praising the \\"surprises and delights on this smoky, Lynchian retreat\\". 2015 saw the label release \\"Under Branch & Thorn & Tree\\" by Samantha Crain. The Observer gave the album four stars, praising \\"the richness of Crain's voice and the elegant simplicity of the musical arrangements\\". Other highlights included Dutch psych artist Jacco Gardner's \\"Hypnophobia\\", and Farao's \\"Till It's All Forgotten\\". In 2016 the label released the final album from School of Seven Bells, \\"SVIIB\\", which Pitchfork gave a score of 8.1.

It is a documentary film about the life of the Italian-American jazz musician Anthony Joseph Sciacca, known to the public as Tony Scott, starting from his childhood and youth in the USA, until his death, following a long illness, in Rome in 2007. In the film, a great number of American and Italian musicians are interviewed, such as the legend of clarinet Buddy DeFranco, pianist Mario Rusca and drummer Tony Arco and, also, a few non-musician friends of Scott‚Äôs. Moreover, Scott‚Äôs three wives and the two daughters from his second marriage provided many details about Tony Scott's life and, also, about their own feelings. The documentary was shown at the 63rd Locarno International Film Festival (as a non-competing film) and at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2010. Synopsis Io sono Tony Scott, ovvero come l'Italia fece fuori il pi√π grande clarinettista del jazz narrates in detail the private and artistic life of Tony Scott, who reportedly regarded himself as ‚Äúthe number one clarinetist in the world‚Äù. Through clips, pictures and interviews with people who knew Scott, this documentary film goes over the astonishing story of the life of Tony, who was a very popular clarinetist in the 1950s, but later encountered tremendous personal and professional decline, after relocating to Italy in the seventies. In the first part of the documentary, in the USA, the facts about Scott‚Äôs artistic cooperation and strong friendship with Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker and Billie Holiday are told, emphasizing his extraordinary talent as an experimenter and a virtuoso of jazz clarinet. In her interview, Tony‚Äôs first wife, Fran Attaway, reveals a hitherto unknown detail of his biography: according to her, during a trip to Indonesia, Tony was mistaken to be a spy and, consequently, detained and possibly tortured. Later in the film, it is suggested that this experience haunted him for the rest of his life and, perhaps, was the cause for the paranoid attitude he showed at times. In the second part, which is set after his move to Europe, Tony‚Äôs personal decline and the waning of his success is narrated with strong sympathy and in great detail. In the film, it is suggested that such decline was caused both by the lack of recognition by the Italian public and music critics for his talent and by his difficult personality and erratic behaviour, which alienated Tony Scott from the circle of jazz musicians. Towards the end of his life, Tony lived in considerable poverty; he died in 2007, after a long illness. His body was temporarily placed in a relative‚Äôs family vault in Salemi (Sicily), where his father was born. Production Director Franco Maresco wrote that \\"To go over Tony's private and professional life is to go over sixty years of jazz, of unbelievable personal and artistic encounters. At the same time, it is a narration of the American history of the second half of the past century, of the battles for civil and human rights, of which Tony Scott was one of the main and most passionate supporters\\".Swissinfo.ch - Una finestra sul cinema Cast * Tony Scott as himself References External links * Official website of Io sono Tony Scott, ovvero come l'Italia fece fuori il pi√π grande clarinettista del jazz * ;Reviews * Film review by Jorge Mourinha * Film review by Annibale Bezzan (in Italian) * Film review by Nicoletta Dose (in Italian) * Film review by Giona A.

Bowles was a younger son of Phineas Bowles of St. Michael's, Crooked Lane, London, and Loughborough House, Lambeth, and his wife Margaret Dockwra, daughter of William Dockwra, merchant of London. He joined the army and was a Captain in the Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1710, taking part in the campaigns of 1710 to 1711 under the Duke of Marlborough. He became captain and lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd Foot Guards in 1713. In 1719 he succeeded his cousin, Major-General Phineas Bowles, as colonel of the 12th Lancers in Ireland and commanded the regiment in Ireland until 1740. He married Alethea Maria Hill, daughter and heiress of Samuel Hill of Kilmainham, Dublin under a settlement dated 7 and 8 June 1724. He became a brigadier- general in 1735. Bowles was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bewdley at a by-election on 20 February 1735 to replace his elder brother William, who chose to sit for Bridport. He voted with the Administration and was promoted to major-general in 1739 and appointed Governor of Limerick. He became colonel of the 6th Dragoon Guards in 1740 and served with them for the rest of his life. He did not stand at the 1741 British general election when his brother took up the seat at Bewdley again. Bowles was promoted to lieutenant-general on 27 May 1745 and was appointed Governor of Londonderry. He died in Dublin on 22 October 1749, leaving two sons and a daughter.

They are relatively small with a length of about 50 to 60 amino acids and a molecular weight of 6 kDa. Examples of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors are aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI), Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Standalone Kunitz domains are used as a framework for the development of new pharmaceutical drugs.  Structure  The structure is a disulfide rich alpha+beta fold. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is an extensively studied model structure. Certain family members are similar to the tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP, ). This is a highly selective inhibitor of factor Xa in the blood coagulation pathways. TAP molecules are highly dipolar, and are arranged to form a twisted two-stranded antiparallel beta sheet followed by an alpha helix. The majority of the sequences having this domain belong to the MEROPS inhibitor family I2, clan IB; the Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family, they inhibit proteases of the S1 family and are restricted to the metazoa with a single exception: Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus, a species of poxvirus. They are short (about 50 to 60 amino acid residues) alpha/beta proteins with few secondary structures. The fold is constrained by three disulfide bonds. The type example for this family is BPTI (or basic protease inhibitor), but the family includes numerous other members, such as snake venom basic protease; mammalian inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors; trypstatin, a rat mast cell inhibitor of trypsin; a domain found in an alternatively spliced form of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein; domains at the C-termini of the alpha-1 and alpha-3 chains of type VI and type VII collagens; tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor; and Kunitz STI protease inhibitor contained in legume seeds.  Drug development  Kunitz domains are stable as standalone peptides, able to recognise specific protein structures, and also work as competitive protease inhibitors in their free form. These properties have led to attempts at developing biopharmaceutical drugs from Kunitz domains. Candidate domains are selected from molecular libraries containing over 10 million variants with the aid of display techniques like phage display, and can be produced in large scale by genetically engineered organisms. The first of these drugs to be marketed was the kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, used for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. It was approved in the United States in 2009. Another example is depelestat, an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase that has undergone Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in 2006/2007 and has also been described as a potential inhalable cystic fibrosis treatment.  Examples  Human proteins containing this domain include: * AMBP, APLP2, APP * COL6A3, COL7A1, COL28A1 * PAPLN, * SPINLW1, SPINT1, SPINT2, SPINT3, SPINT4 * TFPI, TFPI2 * WFDC6, WFDC8, WFIKKN1, WFIKKN2 Several plant protease inhibitors of the Kunitz family, the Kunitz-STI protein family, include a beta trefoil fold.

Biography He entered the Modena Military Academy at age 18 and at the end of his course he was assigned to 2nd Mountain Artillery Regiment; at the start of the First World War the unit was sent to the frontline and in 1916 Primieri was promoted to Capitano (Captain) for war merit. In 1936, as a Tenente Colonnello (Lieutenant Colonel) he took part to the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. In 1937 he became the commander of the 28¬∞ Artillery Regiment of the \\"Livorno\\" Division. During the Second World War he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army High Command. After the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 he took over the 44 Infantry Division Cremona which expelled the Germans from Corsica after heavy fighting. The Division was reformed on 23 July 1944 and became Gruppo di Combattimento Cremona (one of the units of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army), which was positioned on the right flank of the British Eighth Army. Under Primieri's command, the Group followed the northward drive of the Allied Armies and contributed to the liberation of several cities including Portomaggiore, Codigoro, Rovigo, Padua and finally Venice on 2 May 1945. At the end of the war he remained the commander of the new \\"Cremona\\" Division, stationed at Turin. He was then transferred to the 4th Mountain Army Corps, of which he was commander from July 1952 up till 1954, and later on served in the Verona Allied Land Forces Southern Europe Command.

He was appointed Rear-admiral in 1814, having been made a Baron in 1811. A street in Brest bears his name, as does a bay and port of the island of Huahine in French Polynesia.  Career   Origins and youth  Born in Brest on 22 February 1768, Caesar Bourayne was the 5th child of a family of 13, including two naval officers and two navy commissioners, which earned their mother the nickname \\"the mother to the seamen‚Äù. In 1781, at 13 years old, he embarked on the 80-gun ship of the line Auguste, commanded by the famous captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville. Auguste was part of the fleet of the Comte de Grasse, which operated in the Atlantic against the British during the American Revolutionary War. He participated in the various actions of this campaign including the critical victory at the Battle of the Chesapeake, and the decisive defeat at The Battle of the Saintes. In the 10 years that followed, he continued his training in many engagements in the Caribbean, Africa, Red Sea, Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia.  Early career as an officer  In 1791, Bourayne was commissioned as an officer and served aboard the 38-gun frigate Venus during the scientific expedition of Rosily. In August 1792 he was commissioned as an officer serving on the frigate M√©duse. By 1793 he had been promoted to lieutenant and served under Charles Linois on the 36-gun frigate Atalante. On 7 May 1794, while hunting for British merchantmen off the coast of Ireland, Atalante and accompanying corvette Levrette came across a convoy protected by two British ships of the line, Swiftsure and St Albans. The British ships moved to intercept, and though Levrette escaped, Atalante was taken after a 48-hour chase. Bourayne was wounded in the action of 7 May 1794 and taken prisoner. He was paroled in the Bantry Bay area for 19 months before he was returned to France in October 1795. Borayne went on to serve under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse in the Irish Sea and Caribbean. In 1800 Bourayne was promoted to Capitaine de fr√©gate, and appointed first officer on Redoutable, and later on R√©publicain,Levot, p.53 before commanding the frigate Fid√®le from June of that year. On 18 July 1803 he received his promotion to Captaine de vaisseau, on taking command of the recently recaptured 40-gun frigate Minerve, which was now renamed Canonni√®re.  As captain  On 14 November 1805, Canonni√®re sailed from Cherbourg to reinforce Linois at √éle de France in the Indian Ocean. When Linois was not to be found there, Bourayne sailed in search of him off the cape of good hope. It was here that he fell in with a fleet of British Indiamen, resulting in the Action of 21 April 1806.James, W. \\"Naval History of Great Britain\\" vol IV. London Baldwin, Cradock & Joy, 1824, p. 234- 236 After effecting as much repairs as possible at sea, Bourayne steered for Simon's Town, an allied Dutch anchorage. Unknown to him however, it had recently been seized by the English. In a ruse common to marine warfare, the English forts and shipping at the bay flew the Dutch colours, and so Bourayne sent a boat to shore. At this point the forts changed their colours and began to bombard the frigate. The Canonni√®re stood out to sea, escaping major damage, but the lieutenant and men aboard the boat were taken prisoner. Bourayne then set off for Manila, where he could properly repair his ship. He was asked there by the Governor of the Philippines to fetch a large sum of money from Acapulco, across the Pacific Ocean in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This mission was carried out over a six-month round trip, and he continued to operate in the Pacific until making a return to the Isle de France in 1808. In September 1808, the British 22-gun frigate Laurel arrived off Isle de France, and soon after recaptured a Portuguese ship which had been taken as a prize by the French. Under a flag of truce, the captain of Laurel requested a boat to be sent out from Port Louis to retrieve French ladies captured on board the prize. On board the boat went an officer of Canonni√®re, to reconnoitre the capabilities of the English ship. Bourayne was satisfied she was no match for Canonniere, and so set out to capture her. This he did, after a notably spirited defence from the smaller frigate. Bourayne continued to cruise the Indian Ocean, capturing Discovery ( ? ), before returning to Isle de France in 1809. The Canonni√®re was found there to be now in such a state of disrepair that she was renamed Confiance and sent back to France as a semi-armed merchantman, with Bourayne aboard as a passenger. Very near to her destination however, she was spotted and taken by the 74-gun Valiant, and so Bourayne found himself a captive for the second time.  Later years  On 2 May 1811, while still in captivity, Napoleon awarded him the title Baron of the Empire. In spring 1814, he was finally released and returned to France. He was now 46, and his sailing career was over ‚Äì however he was further promoted to Contre-amiral in 1815, and made prefect of Brest during the Hundred Days. He died on 5 November 1817 in Brest at the age of 49.

It has a large collection of photographs and old cameras. Among the founding members were Olympe Aguado, Hippolyte Bayard, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel, Eug√®ne Durieu, Edmond Fierlants, Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, Gustave Le Gray and Henri Victor Regnault. Henri Victor Regnault was the first president. History The Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie, founded on 15 November 1854, was based on the short-lived Soci√©t√© h√©liographique (1851) but differed in that it was less elitist and more forward-looking. Some accounts mistakenly link the two organizations more closely, referring simply to a change in the name with a view to giving the SFP the status of the world's oldest photography organization.\\"Cercles et soci√©t√©s photographiques\\", Mus√©e fran√ßais de la photographie. Retrieved 8 December 2010. A careful analysis of the Soci√©t√© h√©liographique describes in detail how the initial enthusiasm for the organization quickly disappeared resulting in the discontinuation of its activities. The SFP was thus established without any formal connection to the Soci√©t√© h√©liographique.Andr√© Gunthert, \\"L'institution du photographique: Le roman de la Soci√©t√© h√©liographique\\", Etudes photographiques, November 2002. . Retrieved 8 December 2010. The objectives of the SFP were therefore far more commercially oriented and more concerned with future developments, like the Acad√©mie des sciences. Its members -- ambitious amateurs, artists, businessmen and scientists -- had regular meetings at an established venue, with a written agenda. The objectives were published in a programme and there were regular bulletins. For the remainder of the 19th century, the association was exclusively concerned with improvements to photography. There were regular exhibitions of the members' images, as well as conferences and presentations addressing new techniques, their artistic potential and the latest innovations. The SFP considered itself both an academy of photography and a library of archives. The photographs exhibited were properly archived, together with many comments from the members. From the beginning of the 20th century, the SFP set itself the task of safeguarding historic works. Today it acts as a research centre on the history and development of photography. Since 1997, it has published the twice-yearly journal √âtudes photographiques with articles on prominent photographers and on the history of photography. The association has a valuable historic collection consisting of some 10,000 images and 50,000 negatives (including 5,000 autochromes. There is also a specialist library with 8,000 books and over 650 journals. The first president of the SFP was Henri Victor Regnault.

He was apprenticed to his cousin, an Exeter chemist and druggist, but moved to London in 1790 to set himself up in business.http://www.blundells.org/admin/school_notable- obs.htm#18thc He was a member of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, of which he became Prime Warden, a member of the Court of Aldermen of the City of London, and served as Sheriff of the City of London for 1809 and as Lord Mayor of London from 1815 to 1817. He was elected unopposed as a Member of Parliament for the City of London at a by-election in June 1817, following the resignation of Harvey Christian Combe MP. He held the seat until his death in 1843. Wood was a prominent partisan and adviser of Queen Caroline on her return to England in 1820, a controversial role. Greville noted acerbically in his diary on 7 June 1820:Charles C. F. Greville, A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV, volume I (London, Longmans Green & Co, 1874), at page 28 :\\"The Queen arrived in London yesterday at seven o‚Äôclock‚Ä¶ She travelled in an open landau, Alderman Wood sitting by her side and Lady Anne Hamilton and another woman opposite. Everybody was disgusted at the vulgarity of Wood in sitting in the place of honour, while the Duke of Hamilton‚Äôs sister was sitting backwards in the carriage\\". Wood's radicalism belied his very 19th century propensity for improving his and his family's lot. The brush with royalty may have given him ideas about fixing his status and his family's inheritance prospects. In 1836 the 'Gloucester millionaire', banker James 'Jemmy' Wood, and one of the richest men in the country, died, and the Alderman became one of his heirs. Matthew Wood was actually no relation to the millionaire despite their shared surname. It seems Jemmy Wood's feeble-minded sister was an admirer of Queen Caroline and had taken a shine to the Alderman, to the extent of leaving property to him when she died. Gaining more knowledge of the Gloucester Woods by living in his newly acquired property, the radical MP must have soon realized the vulnerability of the old banker and his fortune. In 1833, Jemmy gave the Alderman rent-free use of Hatherley House which the bank had acquired through a bankruptcy. The mutual back scratching led to Wood allowing Jemmy to send all his mail under parliamentary franked cover. Soon, the Alderman was setting his sights on a baronetcy not only for himself, but also for the old millionaire as a kind of backstop. The story of the will is a very complex one, but it involved leaving the entire estate valued at nearly ¬£1,000,000, to Alderman Wood and three other executors. Eventually, after a long court case against Wood and the other three executor- beneficiaries, on 20 Feb 1839 Judge Jenner in an extremely long and detailed verdict at the Arches Prerogative Court, London, 'decided that the terms were made by conspiracy and fraud, and ordered that the whole of the immense property should be divided amongst two relations'. And yet, within a couple of years, this verdict was overturned on appeal by Lord Lyndhurst, and the four men (or family in the case of John Chadborn, Jemmy's lawyer, who had hanged himself in the interim) who had been accused of fraud were awarded what money and property was left after court costs were allowed for. The inheritance formed the basis of the Wood family fortunes (now the Page Woods) and also that of John Chadborn's daughter's family, the Prices. Alderman Wood was finally made a Baronet in 1837, of Hatherley House in Gloucestershire, the name of his country seat. Marriage and children On 5 November 1795 Wood married Maria Page, the daughter of John Page of Woodbridge in Suffolk, by whom he had six children: # John-Page Wood (1796‚Äì1866), who became a Church of England vicar in Essex His daughter Katharine Wood (1846‚Äì1921) was better known by her married name of Katharine O'Shea. Popularly known as Kitty O'Shea, her relationship with the Irish leader Charles Stewart Parnell led to a political scandal which caused his downfall. John's son Evelyn Wood (1838‚Äì1919) was a Field Marshal and a recipient of the Victoria Cross. # Maria-Elizabeth Wood (born 1798) # Catharine Wood (born 1799) # William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley (1801‚Äì1881), a barrister and Liberal MP who served as Lord Chancellor from 1868 to 1872 # Western Wood (1804‚Äì1863), MP for the City of London 1861‚Äì63 # Henry-Wright Wood (born 1806), died an infant  References   External links   Category:1768 births Category:1843 deaths Category:People educated at Blundell's School Category:Whig (British political party) MPs for English constituencies Category:People from the Borough of Tewkesbury Category:UK MPs 1812‚Äì1818 Category:UK MPs 1818‚Äì1820 Category:UK MPs 1820‚Äì1826 Category:UK MPs 1826‚Äì1830 Category:UK MPs 1830‚Äì1831 Category:UK MPs 1831‚Äì1832 Category:UK MPs 1832‚Äì1835 Category:UK MPs 1835‚Äì1837 Category:UK MPs 1837‚Äì1841 Category:UK MPs 1841‚Äì1847 Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Sheriffs of the City of London Category:19th-century lord mayors of London Category:19th-century British politicians Category:19th- century English politicians ","title":"Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"29926628","text":"Cambridge Montessori school History Cambridge Montessori School is a private American Montessori Society and Association of Independent Schools of New England certified private Montessori school that was founded in 1963 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Sedimentary structures with similar appearance have been found. They can be considered a type of fossil, but their significance and authenticity has been questioned. Description Fossil raindrops Modern raindrop impressions in stream sediments near Hanover, NH Raindrop impressions are only a few millimeters thick and less than 1 centimeter in diameter. They can be preserved as widely scattered impressions or in close proximity to one another on the sediment surface. Raindrop impressions can appear as small craters or as small raised bumps. If the sample has craters, the top of the sample is being viewed because the rain would have fallen onto it making indentations. If the sample has small raised bumps, the bottom of the sample is being viewed. In this case, the raindrop impressions were created in the sediment, which was then followed by more sediment which filled the impressions, creating, what appear to be, raised bumps on the bottom of the upper layer. Fossilized raindrop impressions can help scientists determine historical atmospheric pressure. Other explanations for the features Rainfall is not the only explanation for the geological feature, and not all \\"raindrop impressions\\" are considered to have formed due to the impact of raindrops. Arguments against a raindrop origin include: * During shower activity raindrops cover the entire surface, whereas raindrop impressions are generally scattered and few in number. * Because the rain is falling \\"everywhere,\\" raindrop impressions should occur equally on sand-sized material as well as mud, yet in the geologic record these impressions are largely confined to fine-grained rock. * Even when raindrop impressions form in mud during a shower, further rainfall eventually destroys them, leaving a surface which is not helpful to further preservation of impressions. * Many examples cited as modern or fossil raindrop impressions can be explained by air bubbles rising through the mud. * The characteristics of any impression depend on so many variables they can not be used convincingly to demonstrate those impressions formed specifically by raindrops. In order for raindrop impressions to be preserved in the rock record, the impression would have to have occurred towards the end of a rain shower. The decreased number of impacts at this time accounts for the scattered patterns of the impressions, and the specific saturation of the sediment allows for preservation. It is difficult to differentiate between actual impressions made by rain and other sources such as gas bubbles escaping, or dripping from another surface, because the structures that are preserved have the same characteristics.

(eds.), Chemical Instabilities. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, pp. 305-328. rings composed of iron oxide can also occur in permeable igneous and metamorphic rocks that have been chemically weathered.McBride, E. F. (2003), Pseudofaults resulting from compartmentalized Liesegang bands: update. Sedimentology, 50: 725‚Äì730.  History  In 1896, a German Chemist named Raphael E. Liesegang first described Liesegang banding in his observations from the results of an experiment, and Wilhelm Ostwald provided the earliest explanation for the phenomenon.Steefel, Carl I., 2008, Geochemical Kinetics and Transport: in Brantley, Susan L; Kubicki, James d; White, Art F. (eds), Kinetics of Water-Rock Interaction, Springer New York, p. 545-589. The purpose of Liesegang's experiment was to observe precipitate formation resulting from the chemical reaction produced when a drop of silver nitrate solution was placed onto the surface of potassium dichromate gel. The resultant precipitate of silver dichromate formed a concentric pattern of rings. Liesegang and successive other workers observed the behavior of precipitates forming rings in sedimentary rocks, hence these features became known as Liesegang rings.  Mechanism for development  Anvil rock in the Shawnee National Forest, Illinois A close view of a Liesegang ring present on a natural arch of sandstone, found at a beach near Khayelitsha, South Africa. Liesegang rings (concentric concretions) on east side of Saginaw Hill, Tucson Arizona The process by which Liesegang rings develop is not completely understood. Liesegang rings may form from the chemical segregation of iron oxides and other minerals during weathering. One popular mechanism suggested by geochemists is that Liesegang rings develop when there is a lack of convection (advection) and has to do with the inter-diffusion of reacting species such as oxygen and ferrous iron that precipitate in separate discrete bands which become spaced apart in a geometric pattern. A process of precipitation known as the Ostwald-Liesegang supersaturation-nucleation-depletion cycle is known by the geologic community as a probable mechanism for Liesegang ring formation in sedimentary rocks. In this process the \\"...diffusion of reactants leads to supersaturation and nucleation; this precipitation results in localized band formation and depletion of reactants in adjacent zones.\\" As Ostwald suggests, there is a localized formation of crystal seeds that occurs when the right level of supersaturation is reached, and once the crystal seeds form, the growth of the crystals is believed to lower the supersaturation level of fluids in pore spaces surrounding the crystals, thus mineralization that occurs after the initial crystal growth in the surrounding areas develops in bands or rings. One classic example based on the Ostwald-Liesegang hypothesis is observed in water and rock interactions where iron hydroxide precipitates in sandstone through pore space.  Occurrence in the environment  Liesegang ring patterns are considered to be secondary (diagenetic) sedimentary structures, though they are also found in permeable igneous and metamorphic rocks that have been chemically weathered. Chemical weathering of rocks that leads to the formation of Liesegang rings typically involves the diffusion of oxygen in subterranean water into pore space containing soluble ferrous iron. Liesegang rings usually cut across layers of stratification and occur in many types of rock, some of which more commonly include sandstone and chert. Though there is a high occurrence of Liesegang rings in sedimentary rocks, relatively few scientists have studied their mineralogy and texture in enough detail to write more about them.Fu, L., Milliken, K.L., and Sharp, J.M. Jr., 1994. Porosity and permeability variations in fractured and Liesegang-banded Breathitt sandstones (Middle Pennsylvanian), eastern Kentucky: diagenetic controls and implications for modeling dual-porosity systems. Journal of Hydrology, 154: 351-381. Liesegang rings are referred to as examples of geochemical self-organization, meaning that their distribution in the rock does not seem to be directly related to features that were established prior to Liesegang ring formation.Chen, W., Park, A., and Ortoleva, P., 1990. Diagenesis through coupled processes: modeling approach, self-organization, and implications for exploration. American Association of Petroleaum Geologists Memoir 49, Prediction of Quality Through Chemical Modeling. pp. 103-130. For instance, in certain types of sedimentary rocks such as carbonate siltstones (calcisiltites), Liesegang ring patterns can be misinterpreted for faults; the rings may appear to be \\"offset,\\" however the laminae in the rock exhibit an unbroken pattern, therefore the observed offset is attributed to pseudofaulting. Pseudofaults are the result of Liesegang rings developing within areas of the rock that are adjacent to each other but at varying stratigraphic levels. Liesegang rings can have the appearance of fine lamination and can be mistaken for laminae when parallel or subparallel to the bedding plane, and are more easily differentiated from laminae when the rings are observed cutting across beds or lamination.

Cone-in-cone structures in limestone. Cone-in-cone structures are secondary sedimentary structures that form in association with deeper burial and diagenesis. They consist of concentric inter-bedded cones of calcite or more rarely gypsum, siderite or pyrite. Although several mechanisms may be responsible for the formation of cone-in- cone structures, displacive crystal mechanism is preferred. It accounts for the most uniform and consistent explanation of growth and why cone-in-cone can occur with such variable composition.  Description  Cone-in-cone structures are identifiable by their distinctive conical appearance. They are composed of concentric cones nested inside each other. The actual composition of the cones is variable and dependent on the environment in which they were formed, with the majority of the cone-in-cone structures being composed of calcite with thin layers of clay between cones. There are also, more rarely, structures composed of siderite, gypsum, pyrite. There are also some instances of cone-in-cone occurring within coals. Often the cone-in-cone will be found as features of calcite layers within a shale,Carstens, H. 1985. Early diagenetic cone-in-cone-structures in pyrite concretions. Journal of Sedimentary Petrology. Volume 55. Pg 105-108. and rarely within a dedolomite (calcitized dolomite).Kowal-Linka M. 2010. Origin of cone-in-cone calcite veins during calcitization of dolomites and their subsequent diagenesis: A case study from the Gogolin Formation (Middle Triassic), SW Poland. Sedimentary Geology 224: 54-64.  Formation  The formation of cone-in-cone structures has been attributed to: #Volume increase inversion from aragonite to calcite in which expansion of conical aragonite pushed cones apart and allowed for clay to intrude # Burial-induced pressure solution and clay layers remaining as insoluble residues # Fracturing of crystalline mineral composites that form in over-pressured chambers, with fractures forming from a decrease in pore pressure # Formation during early diagenesis by expansive mineral growth (force of crystal growth), in which the cones are produced by the growth of cone-shaped aggregates of fibrous calcite, the clay layers originate as the crystals displace and disturb the original clay-rich sediment. # Gillman and MetzgerGillman, R.A., Metzger, W.J.. 1967. Cone-in-cone concretions from western New York. Journal of Sedimentary Petrology. Volume 37. Pg 87-95 proposed that their cone-in-cone structures were formed as a result that as fibrous aragonite grew, it displaced the still plastic clay materials. This is very similar to the displacive crystal growth mechanism proposed above in point number four. The displacive crystal growth mechanism tends to be the more popular and widely used explanation for cone-in-cone formation. In all cases the common trend is for crystal formation to begin within partially consolidated sediment. As cone-in-cone formation happens it begins to take up more and more space within the sediment bed which begins to cause pressure. The pressure results in the cone shape, as parts of the structure are under greater or lesser pressures and grow differentially based on these varying pressures. The nature of displacement from crystal growth has led many to believe that most of the actual precipitation occurs very early during shallow burial. Some have concluded that, based upon 18O depleted values from some of the cone-in-cone material that they can form later, perhaps at hundreds of meters of burial depth.  History  Cone-in-cone structures have been known since the late 1700s, and people have attempted to explain the reasons for their formations. One of the earlier explanations was actually on par with the currently accepted methods for formation as discussed above. Some of the other methods offered for their formation were given by Shaub (1937). It was suggested that the formation of cone-in-cone resulted from volume shrinkage and slow dewatering of highly saturated and loosely packed materials. He suggests that partially developed conical surfaces are also possible as a result of pressure developed from overlying sediments under conditions where a unilateral release of horizontal pressure may become effective. He goes on to suggest that the current explanations of his time are inadequate to cover the structure and its formation. He even suggested that formation due to crystallization was not consistent.Shaub, B.M. (1937) Origin of Cone-In-Cone and its Bearing on the Origin of Concretions and Septaria. American Journal of Science. Pg 331-344. This growth due to crystallization is a significant portion of the currently accepted mode of formation.

With a length of , the canal runs in a northerly direction from Deinze, turning to a north-western direction roughly halfway along its route to the North Sea with which it meets on the coast near to Heist. It crosses both the Gent-Bruges Canal and for its final runs parallel with the Leopold Canal as it approaches the north Belgian coast. For most of this final section the two canals are separated only by a dyke. History An island in the Schipdonk Canal The digging of this canal took place between 1846 and 1860.The Schipdonk Canal: A paper on the website of Zomergem Zomergem. Along with the Leopold Canal it was one of the first major infrastructure projects of the newly independent Belgium. In the middle part of the nineteenth century the economy of the Kortrijk region was dominated by the textile industry, with an emphasis on linen. This industry heavily polluted the Lys River. In order to divert the polluted water from the centre of Gent, it was decided to cut the Schipdonk Canal which transported the pollution more directly to the North Sea, avoiding Gent in the process. A further benefit from the canal involved protecting Gent against the periodic flooding to which it had been subject. The third significant benefit was that the canal provided a relatively direct route for water transport from the industrially active Kortrijk district to the North Sea. Nomenclature The Schipdonk Canal is sometimes known as De Stinker (the stinker) as a result of its traditionally polluted condition. This also contrasts with the condition of the Leopold Canal, sometimes known as De Blinker (the blinking one), recalling its relatively clear water.

In the United States, operators commonly supported by such solutions include AT&T; Mobility, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Corporation, T-Mobile US, in addition to smaller regional carriers as required. Below ground level, large buildings and high rises are examples where mobile phones are unable to properly reach the carrier's macro or outdoor network. In these environments, the in-building cellular enhancement system will connect to the carrier's signal source which is typically a bi-directional amplifier or a base transceiver station. This signal source transmits (and receives) the mobile network operator's licensed radio frequency. This frequency is then transported within the building using coaxial cable, optical fiber or Category 5e/Category 6 twisted pair cable. In-building coverage antennas are strategically placed to provide the best overall coverage for users. Application independence A cellular enhancement system does not read or modify the information represented within the radio frequency (RF) that passes through the system; rather, it reinforces the signal penetration of voice and data frequencies in low signal areas and in dead spots within structures, 2G to 4G migration As the industry evolves, most MNO networks are now made up of 3G based services and are migrating towards 4G based services. In-building cellular enhancement systems designed for 2G or primarily voice-based services may not be sufficient to support 4G services since signal strength and signal quality specifications become more stringent as the applications move from a voice-centric paradigm to a high speed data-centric paradigm. Therefore, a system designed to provide good quality 2G services may be insufficient or unable to provide quality 4G services. Traditionally, MNO services have been delivered within two frequency ranges: the 800 MHz band and the 1900 MHz band. Additional frequency bands have been auctioned by the FCC resulting in increased capacity for the MNOs which are starting to implement 4G services in the 700 MHz and 2100 MHz frequency ranges. Passive in-building cellular enhancement system A coaxial cable-only system is typically referred to as a passive system when all system components (other than the signal source) are coaxial cable, coverage antennas and other components that do not require AC or DC power to function. Pros and cons of a passive system A passive system is less expensive to install and is best suited for smaller buildings where one or possibly two MNOs need to be enhanced within the building and are not usually installed in spaces over . Passive systems require the RF power to be balanced among all the coverage antennas so there is uniform signal strength throughout the building. Expanding a passive system after the initial deployment could require a re-engineering of the entire system to ensure proper operation throughout the building. The number of in-building antennas and coverage area is dependent on the output power of the signal source. Active in-building cellular enhancement system Systems that require conversion of the radio frequency into other forms, such as optical signals, use products that require AC or DC power to perform the conversion near the signal source. Additional products located throughout the building are then used to convert the signals back into native radio frequency format, which are then transmitted through the coverage antennas. Since the equipment at both ends of the cable require AC or DC power to operate, the system is considered to be active. Pros and cons of an active system An active system can be deployed in large buildings and/or within a campus of buildings by converting and transporting the radio frequency over optical fiber. Many active systems have been deployed covering areas of and larger. Active systems are best suited when there is a need to support multiple MNOs or large single buildings or campuses with multiple buildings. Expansion of an active system is usually in the form of adding more active equipment to increase the number of coverage antennas within the building, to increase the number of MNOs, or to increase the service offerings of an MNO such as adding 3G or 4G services. In a properly designed active system, no reengineering or rebalancing of the original system is required when the system is expanded. Optical fiber systems can provide coverage in areas up to 2 km from the signal source making them ideal for campus environments. An active system will always be more expensive than a passive system.

The station operates the HC-144 Ocean Sentry maritime patrol aircraft and the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter. History The history of Coast Guard Air Station Miami began in the late 1920s when the city leased land to the United States Navy. Glenn H. Curtiss had been lobbying for the establishment of the Naval Reserve Base in Miami since 1928. This property became a Naval Reserve Aviation Training Base (NRATB). In 1932 the U.S. Navy leased from the city of Miami what is today the west half of Opa-locka airport. On this land the Navy erected a dirigible mooring mast. The dirigible USS Akron stopped at this mast on both legs of its 1933 trip to the Panama Canal Zone, and departed the station less than two weeks before its fatal crash in April 1933. The base was one of the stops on the triangular Germany-Brazil-United States-Germany route of the Graf Zeppelin. Amelia Earhart made her second attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 1937. The unpublicized flight began in Oakland, California and from there, Earhart flew to Miami, Florida, landing there on 23 May 1937. But a miscalculation by navigator Fred Noonan had Earhart land her Lockheed Electra at the wrong airport. She first landed at Eastern Air Lines 36th Street Airport, which was closed with no one in the control tower.http://the305.com/2013/09/01/1937-amelia-earharts-plane-landing-in- miami-at-opa-locka-airport/ Earhart took off once again and six minutes later landed at the Miami Municipal Airport. She stayed in Miami for a week or so studying her flight path. Miami was the last place of the continental U.S. that she visited before heading on to the rest of her ill-fated journey. The pair departed Miami on 1 July headed to Puerto Rico, the next immediate stop after Miami. The All-American Airport was acquired by the City of Miami around 1938 and on this land the city of Miami built the first \\"Miami International (Master) Airport\\". Major expansion of the base began in 1939, and it was commissioned as Naval Air Station Miami (NAS Miami) in 1940. Aerial view of NAS Miami in the mid-1940s The Naval Reserve Air Base, the Municipal Blimp Hangar, the U.S. Navy's Dirigible Mooring Mast, the city of Miami's Municipal Airport and the All-American Airport existed as separate facilities until their land became incorporated into NAS Miami. Miami Municipal Airport and Miami International (Master) Airport were purchased from the city by the federal government in 1942 and added to Naval Air Station Miami (NAS Miami) as Miami Municipal Field and Master Field (later referred to colloquially as \\"Masters Field\\"), respectively. Miami Municipal Field was connected to Masters Field by a taxiway that crossed the railroad tracks which separated the two fields. Miami Municipal Field was renamed Amelia Earhart Field in 1947. The All-American Air Races were held at Miami Municipal/Amelia Earhart Field or All-American Airport/Miami International (Master) Airport from 1929 until 1935, and the All-American Air Maneuvers from 1935 until 1941 and from 1946 to 1950. During World War II, NAS Miami was headquarters for operations of the U.S. Naval Air Training Command, with six training bases. NAS Miami consisted of the original training base, known as Mainside or Opa-locka, Miami Municipal Field and Master Field. At its peak, the base employed 7,200 officers and men and 3,100 civilians. Activity continued on a reduced basis after the war. Following the departure of U.S. Navy, but retention of U.S. Marine Corps Reserve flying and aviation support units, Master Field became Marine Corps Air Station Miami (MCAS Miami) circa 1955.History of Marine fighter squadron stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miami ‚Äì URL retrieved 8 April 2006 With the transfer of Marine Air Reserve squadrons and support units to NAS Jacksonville, Florida in 1958 and 1959, MCAS Miami was marked for closure and the air station closed as a Department of the Navy installation in 1959. Former military property was transferred to Dade County and the Dade County Junior College opened on the site in 1961. In 1962 the remainder of the former NAS Miami property, except for a portion reserved for the United States Coast Guard, was transferred to Dade County, and became Opa-locka Airport. In 1965 Coast Guard Air Station Miami transferred its aircraft and operations from its Dinner Key installation to the Opa-locka Airport, re-establishing CGAS Miami on site utilizing one of the former Navy hangars, associated flight line and several support buildings. CGAS Miami continues to operate on site with HC-144 Ocean Sentry fixed-wing aircraft and MH-65 Dolphin helicopters.

On 29 September 2000, a day after the letter was published by the Croatian media, Croatian President Stjepan Mesiƒá reacted by sending into forced retirement all seven of the signatories who were active- duty officers. The affair was a source of significant controversy in Croatia and is considered one of the key events in Mesiƒá's ten-year presidential incumbency. Background Croatia underwent major political changes in late 1999 ‚Äì early 2000. The first President of Croatia and leader of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), Franjo Tuƒëman, died in office in December 1999. In January 2000 Tuƒëman's HDZ, a nationalist party that had ruled Croatia since independence in 1991, lost power in the parliamentary elections and was replaced by a center-left coalition of six parties. Stjepan Mesiƒá, one of Tuƒëman's fiercest critics, won the presidential elections in the same month. The new liberal and pro-European government began to investigate war crimes committed by Croatian forces in the Croatian War of Independence (1991‚Äì1995), aiming to improve cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague. These developments enraged the war veterans' groups and extreme nationalists. After a key whistleblower and war crime witness Milan Levar was murdered on 28 August 2000, a wave of arrests of war crime suspects followed. In response, veterans' groups organized protests that escalated into threats and violence. An anonymous death threat was sent to President Mesiƒá and Prime Minister Raƒçan. The new government also started a cycle of defense reforms, which aroused further concern among high-ranking officers of the Croatian Army who were themselves war veterans. Content The letter was titled \\"An Open Letter of Croatian Generals to the Croatian Public\\" () and organized into six points. The first point noted \\"with bitterness\\" that a significant proportion of media and politicians spoke of the Croatian War of Independence as \\"something bad, problematic, even shameful, while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom, independence and sovereignty\\". The signatories stressed in the second point that they were not against the sanctioning of individual criminal acts. However, they asserted that recent actions by the police had left the impression of a crackdown on terrorism or organized crime, rather than an act of a democratic country within the rule of law, in accord with the actual circumstances and the dignity of war veterans and Croatian Army officers. The third point denounced what the signatories called an \\"unnecessary show of force\\" and presumptions of guilt, including speculation about indictments by the ICTY, deeming them detrimental to tolerance and democracy in Croatia. The fourth point rejected conflicts, violence and terrorism, which the signatories deemed to not be in the interests of \\"anyone responsible\\", war veterans in particular. The fifth point comprised a comment by the signatories on speculation regarding the reorganisation of the Croatian Army. They declared their support for the promotion of the most educated and most capable individuals, \\"which means those who proved themselves in the Croatian War of Independence\\". In the sixth and final point, the signatories urged the government, civil society and the media to \\"resist the negativist, historically incorrect and untrue portrayals of the Croatian War of Independence\\" and to \\"protect the dignity of Croatian officers and soldiers\\" as the foundations of Croatian freedom and independence, as well as the future of a democratic and prosperous Croatia. The letter was signed by General of the Army (ret.) Janko Bobetko, Lt. Gen. Ante Gotovina, Lt. Gen. Kre≈°imir ƒÜosiƒá, Maj. Gen. Mirko Norac, Admiral Davor Domazet-Lo≈°o, Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ivan Korade, Maj. Gen. Damir Krstiƒçeviƒá, Lt. Gen. (ret.) Ivan ƒåermak, Maj. Gen. Ivan Kapular, Maj. Gen. (ret.) Nojko Marinoviƒá, Lt. Gen. (ret.) Ivan Basarac and Maj. Gen. Miljenko Filipoviƒá. Reactions In his first public comment on the letter, Croatian President Stjepan Mesiƒá noted that he also supported preserving the dignity of the Croatian War of Independence, provided \\"that the government is still functioning, that there is no selective approach, and that the law applies to everyone\\". He said that some individuals from the HDZ were responsible for the letter's creation. The Office of the President of Croatia and the Croatian Ministry of Defense called the letter \\"inappropriate\\". The Ministry of Defence also described it as \\"unprofessional\\", noting that the law forbids the members of Croatian Armed Forces from engaging in political activities. On 29 September 2000, a day after the letter was published, President Mesiƒá announced that he was retiring all seven serving officers (Gotovina, ƒÜosiƒá, Krstiƒçeviƒá, Kapular, Filipoviƒá, Domazet-Lo≈°o and Norac) who signed the letter. He stated that \\"those who thought a coup d'√©tat in this country could be achieved with pamphlets have played the wrong card. As of today, they are not members of the Croatian Army.\\" Mesiƒá's actions produced widely varied reactions from the political parties. The ruling coalition parties generally supported the move, calling it \\"logical\\", and even \\"necessary\\", while Ivo Sanader, president of the HDZ, criticized it as \\"extremely dangerous\\". Mesiƒá was also severely criticised by Croatian war veterans' organisations. On the other hand, polls showed that the majority of Croatian public supported the President's actions. An article by Nacional weekly warned that twenty more generals were planning to sign a letter against the government, which created concern about an actual coup. President Mesiƒá, however, dismissed such speculations as \\"nonsense\\". Aftermath One year into his first term, Stjepan Mesiƒá said that retiring the generals was one of the best moves he had made as a president. On several occasions it was speculated that the retired generals might return to active duty. On 2 October 2000, President Mesiƒá hinted that his decision might not yet be final for Maj. Gen. Krstiƒçeviƒá, stating that Krstiƒçeviƒá's fate depended on \\"his further conduct\\". At 33 years of age, he was the youngest among the signatories, and was ‚Äì apart from Nojko Marinoviƒá ‚Äì the only general from the Tuƒëman era with no party affiliation. Krstiƒçeviƒá declined Mesiƒá's implicit offer, saying that he had \\"nothing to repent for\\". In the 2003 election campaign, Ivo Sanader, president of the HDZ, announced the possibility of reactivating the generals. However, according to Nacional weekly, Sanader abandoned the idea due to his inability to implement it against the wish of President Mesiƒá, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The issue was raised again in the 2009/2010 presidential election. Three presidential candidates, Milan Bandiƒá, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vido≈°eviƒá, stated that, if elected, they would rehabilitate the generals and return some of them to active duty. The eventual winner of the election, Ivo Josipoviƒá, rejected this suggestion, saying that the generals' retirement was final. Mesiƒá's decision to retire the generals is widely seen as one of the most important events of his presidency. Stjepan Mesiƒá's successor Ivo Josipoviƒá stated that this was Mesiƒá's best move in both of his five-year terms, while Croatian military analyst Igor Tabak described it as a \\"hard decision to take\\", since it came early in the Mesiƒá's first term, and went against an old authoritarian system that was still strong. The move is seen as important in the context of the depoliticisation of the armed forces and defence reforms that ultimately led to the accession of Croatia to NATO in 2009. On the other hand, Mesiƒá's critics contend that the supposed \\"coup\\" was non-existent and that his decision was essentially a continuation of anti-military sentiment which the generals had to publicly address as their patriotic duty.

Early life  Arnot studied (most likely at St Andrews) and was licensed by Cupar Presbytery on 5 Sept 1769. He was ordained minister at the parish of Ceres, Fife on 30 August 1770, where he oversaw (and perhaps even prepared) that parish's report for the Statistical Account of Scotland. He was elected clerk to the presbytery in December 1777. He resigned this post on 16 October 1792 to take up his post as professor of divinity at New College, (nowadays, more commonly called St Mary's College, St Andrews). This had been achieved as a result of much lobbying, and the support of Dundas, and possibly as compensation for a failure to get the chair of ecclesiastical history. Arnot seems not to have published anything and was described by one historian as \\"no scholar\\". He owed his career to the influence of Robert Dundas, who managed Scotland on behalf of his father Henry Dundas. The principal of St Andrews, George Hill, described him in 1791. \\"There is not a more staunch friend to the true principles of moderation, or a man more firmly attached to the Constitution, in the whole Church than Dr Arnot.\\" He was therefore a loyal member of the so-called Moderates in the Church of Scotland. Thomas Chalmers in a letter from Anstruther 1800 says: \\"Dr Arnot resides in Kingsbarns, and will, I believe, win over the people by the popularity of his manners\\". This related to the legal challenge of some of his congregation to his appointment as minister there in 1800, in conjunction with his appointment to the divinity professorship.  Moderator  In a similar fashion, in 1794 he was \\"elected\\" Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The king's letter to the assembly, written by Henry Dundas reflected the troubled times and urged \\"we cannot press too earnestly upon your minds the necessity of redoubling your common efforts to check that prevalent spirit of licentious innovation, by which the present times are so unhappily distinguished, and which threaten to fill the whole Christian world with violence and confusion\\". The assembly responded by indicating that the war against France had its full support, as did measures against disaffected people in Britain. However, they did add \\"it affords us the greatest satisfaction to be able to assure your Majesty, that the sound principles of loyalty, and of attachment to the constitution in Church and State, are fixed in the hearts of the great body of your Majesty's subjects in Scotland\\". The assembly published strict orders to all ministers to ensure the regular reading of the Bible in the Parish schools, along with the Shorter Catechism. They also required every minister to inspect the schools to ensure these activities took place regularly. In addition, the assembly thanked the king for his efforts to spread the Protestant religion in the Highlands and Islands.  Disputed appointments  In 1799, he was presented by the heritor to the parish of Kingsbarns, and took up the post in 1800, after seeing off a challenge that he could not be both a professor and a parish minister. This challenge went as far as the General Assembly, where a very heated debate took place. Some of the speeches against Dr Arnot were later printed‚Äîespecially that of William Laurence Brown, principal of Marischal College‚Äîand helped foment a growing opposition to the Moderates, which eventually led to the Great Disruption of the Church of Scotland, when the many ministers left on the principle of opposition to Patronage and formed the Free Church of Scotland. In 1799 he lobbied hard, proclaiming his loyalty as good Dundas man, for principalship of the United College in St Andrews, along with a living at St Leonards. He had strong support among the faculty, but so did his rival, and neither would give way so Dundas went outside the university for someone \\"independent\\". Arnot was not averse to challenging appointments himself. In 1804, the professor of medicine, James Flint, tried to secure the succession of his son John to his post, by getting him appointed joint professor. Arnot refused to attend the inauguration and took the matter to court. the Court of Session turned down his challenge, but this was overturned five years later by the House of Lords.  Death  On 24 May 1772 he married Helen Barclay, who outlived him and died 4 April 1816. The Reverend Doctor Robert Arnot died on 2 July 1808.

Family background Gormflaith was the daughter of Flann Sinna, High King of Ireland from 879 to 916. Her mother was Gormlaith ingen Flann mac Conaing of Brega. Her known siblings were: * Donnchad Donn, her full sibling. * √ìengus mac Flann Sinna, died 915. * M√°el Ruanaid mac Flann Sinna, killed in 901 * Donnell mac Flann Sinna, King of Mide 919‚Äì921. * L√≠gach ingen Flann Sinna, died 923. * Conchobar mac Flann Sinna, king of Mide 916‚Äì919. * √Åed mac Flann Sinna, blinded on Donnchad Donn's orders in 919. * Cerball mac Flann Sinna * Muirgel ingen Flann Sinna, died 928. Queen of Munster Gormflaith was notable for been the successive queen consort of Munster, Leinster and Tara. Gormflaith was married first to King Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in of Munster, who had taken vows of celibacy as a bishop. The marriage was not said to be consummated. MacShamhran (p. 203) writes that \\"difficulties relating to this marriage leave it probable that it is a fiction ‚Äì created when memory of Gormlaith became assimilated to the \\"sovereignty goddess\\" who had three husbands\\". However, recent work has criticised attempts to see influence from supernatural beliefs in the portrayals of Gormflaith.M√°ire N√≠ Mhaonaigh, 'Tales of Three Gormlaiths in Medieval Irish Literature', √âriu, 52 (2002), 1-24 (2-4). https://www.jstor.org/stable/30008176. Queen of Leinster Cormac was killed at the battle of Bealach Mugna in 908 by an alliance of Flann Sinna of Tara and Cerball mac Muirec√°in, King of Leinster. Flann afterwards married Gormflaith to Cerball, who is alleged (according to a text in the Book of Leinster) to have abused her so much that she was forced to return to her father at least once. Political intrigue MacShamhran writes (p. 203) \\"... the case for accepting as historical her marriage to Cerball is strengthened by a dindshenchas poem in the Book of Leinster, which also presents a different view of their relationship, implying that she was involved in intrigue on his behalf. She is blamed for the deaths of Cellach Carmain, who was an Ui Muirdaig dynast, and his wife Aillenn ‚Äì apparently rivals of her husband. This circumstance, along with the fact that Cerball had the support of Flann Sinna at Belach Mugna, fits well with a Clan Cholmain-Ui Faelain alliance in the years prior to that battle.\\" √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (pp. 219), citing the poem Cell Chorbb√°in (composed shortly after 909), writes: \\"It states quite categorically that Gormlaith was responsible for the death of Cellach of Carmun and his wife Aillend ‚Äì 'she laid them in the church ground' (dos-fuc i talmain cilli) and by these actions 'she wrought terrible deeds' (do-ringni gnimu grana). This is clearly referring to a double-murder, and equally clearly, it is implicit that Gormlaith ‚Äì and, by extension, her husband Cerball? ‚Äì were involved together in a conspiracy to remove the reigning king of Leinster (here named as Cellach Carmun) and presumably replace him with Cerball.\\" √ì Cr√≥in√≠n goes on to compare the data in the poem with that of C√≥ic r√≠g tr√≠chat to show that \\"there is something wrong with the Ui Dunlainge succession at precisely this point. ... It looks very much as though the struggle for succession ... saw several of the Ui Muiredaig line eliminated in the first half of the ninth century, and their names were simply expunged from the record:\\" Queen of Tara After Cerball's death in 909 Gormlaith married her stepbrother Niall Gl√∫ndub, who died in 919. By him she had Muirchertach mac N√©ill, ancestor to the O'Neill dynasty of the north of Ireland. After marriage The Annals of Clonmacnoise have her becoming poverty-stricken after the death of Niall, reduced to wandering from place to place as a poet to survive. This literary tradition, which appears over a century after her death, may be based upon a misreading of her obit in the Annals of Ulster, which instead indicates she died in a convent. Poems A number of poems of later date are ascribed to Gormflaith in Middle Irish sources, including laments for Cerball and Niall, but not for Cormac. L.M. McCraith, noting that ‚Äúthe charm of Gaelic verse depends for the most part on an elaborate system of repetition and alliteration, which no other language can reproduce,‚Äù gives this translation of the poem ‚ÄúGormlaith, the daughter of Flann, speaks to the Priest‚Äù: ‚ÄúMonk, remove thy foot!

Beginning in a mutiny among the troops the Force Publique of Luluabourg (modern-day Kananga) in January 1895, the revolt sparked an prolonged insurgency and two further mutinies elsewhere in the Congo. The rebellion was one of the most important anti-colonial rebellions in the history of the Congo and the last Tetela rebels were only defeated in 1901. Mutinies The Batetela rebellion usually refers to three separate military mutinies in the Force Publique: #1895: mutiny in the garrison of Luluabourg (modern-day Kananga); #1897: mutiny among the troops under Francis Dhanis on an expedition to the Upper Nile; #1900: mutiny among the garrison of Fort de Shinkakasa near Boma. The Force Publique recruited heavily from the Tetela ethnic group in the Sankuru, Maniema and Lomami regions, especially during the Congo Arab War (1892‚Äì94). In January 1895, the garrison of Luluabourg mutinied in response to the execution of the warlord Gongo Lutete for treachery during the war against the Arabs. In October 1896, there were approximately 3‚Äì4,000 Batetela rebels. The mutineers killed one of their white officers and escaped, being joined by Tetela soldiers from across the colony over the coming years. In 1897, 1,300 troops from the Tetela and Kusu ethnic groups in an expeditionary force sent to the Upper Nile under the command of Baron Francis Dhanis mutinied, complaining of poor treatment. The force, the largest military force assembled in colonial Africa up to that point, had been sent to annex the Fashoda region in modern-day South Sudan and the expedition's collapse as a result of the mutiny meant that the Congo Free State would ultimately avoid becoming a party in the Fashoda Incident. The mutineers killed 10 Belgian officers and took a French priest hostage, though he was ultimately released unharmed. The third rebellion broke out in the garrison of the Shinkakasa fort on the Congo river on 17 April 1900. The rebels gained control of the fort and opened fire on a moored ship and threatened the safety of the colonial capital, Boma. Despite being repeatedly defeated, the last Tetela mutineers held out around Lake Kisale until 1901 or 1908. After the conflict the Belgians reformed the Force Publique so that no single ethnic group represented a majority in any given unit.

He was badly wounded in aerial combat resulting in a lengthy convalescence, following which he served as an instructor with Jagdgruppe West from October 1942 to February 1943, when Leutnant Matoni returned to II./JG 26. He shot down a Supermarine Spitfire on 17 June as his fifth victory. On 31 August, Oberleutnant Matoni's Focke Wulf Fw 190 A-5 was hit and he was wounded by return fire from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 bombers, force-landing at Montdidier. In December he claimed a Spitfire near Boulogne on 21 December as his 8th victory. In an action against USAAF B-26 twin-engine bombers on 14 January 1944 Matoni shot down a Spitfire escorting the bombers, probably flown by Austrian-born S/L. Franz Colloredo-Mansfeld DFC (3 destroyed) of No. 132 Squadron RAF, who was killed. On 24 February Matoni shot down a USAAF B-24 four-engine bomber near Frankfurt for his 13th and JG 26's 2,000th victory. Matoni was appointed Staffelkapit√§n (squadron leader) 5./JG 26 in February 1944, and on 10 May was awarded the German Cross in Gold for 20 victories. On 15 August 1944, Hauptmann Matoni was appointed Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of I./Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG 11‚Äî11th Fighter Wing) before being appointed Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 2 on 24 September. On 5 December, Matoni was so seriously injured in a crash he was unfit to undertake any further combat flying. Despite this, he was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of II./JG 2 in January 1945 until 28 February. Matoni was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 16 December 1944. Walter Matoni was credited with 34 victories in over 400 missions. He recorded three victories over the Eastern Front, and of 31 victories claimed over the Western Front, 14 were four-engine bombers. He ended the war at the Fighter Pilot's rest-home at Bad Wiessee. Matoni died on 26 June 1988 in Frankfurt. Just three years before his death, Matoni appeared on the British television show This Is Your Life on the 8 May 1985, the 40th anniversary of the German capitulation. He was guest on the Johnnie Johnson episode, celebrating the RAF ace' life. Matoni's presence owed to a British media-created legend that Johnson personally challenged the German to a duel over Normandy.

He is the publisher of HousingWire magazine, a real estate publication. Career A subprime lender, Bitner collaborated with mortgage brokers from 2000 to 2005. Bitner and his friends started a mortgage business, Plano-based Kellner Mortgage Investments, in September 2000. Kellner was funded through a $175,000 mortgage on his parents' home. They hoped to aid people who lacked the financial standing to receive loans, and in the process, gain profits after those people became homeowners. Each year, the company loaned $250 million to people. After closing loans, the company would sell them to larger lenders, including Countrywide Financial. Books In his 2008 book, Confessions of a Subprime Lender, he discussed how their salutary aims were overridden by a hunger for financial gain. Brokers \\"gamed the system\\", using poor criteria to grant loans. Bitner believed that many people were accepting loans they could not pay off. Bitner exited from his company in 2005 because he felt uncomfortable about the daring loans. The two friends with whom he started the company purchased his shares because they wished to gradually, instead of immediately, close the company. His former company failed in 2007, one of the many casualties during the numerous defaults early that year. Julian Delasantellis of Asia Times Online wrote in a review of the book that \\"Bitner is admirable in that he is willing to take a measure of blame onto himself, when so many others are flailing about furiously trying to do the opposite, but I still think he judges himself somewhat harshly.\\" Bitner self-published the 2008 book Greed, Fraud & Ignorance: A Subprime Lender's Look at the Mortgage Collapse to reveal his story about the 2007 mortgage collapse. Newsweek said that his book \\"conveys the authority of someone who was in the trenches where this dirty work was going on\\". Harry Smith of CBS News interviewed Bitner in February 2009 after Bitner published Confessions of a Subprime Lender. Personal life Bitner attended Northern Arizona University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in public relations. He also attended Cornell University, where he earned a master's degree in communication. He earned both degrees through a scholarships in debate and public speaking. Bitner is married and has two children.

Career Club Started to play at the age of 12, she was first selected for her hometown club Tatab√°nyai TSC. Two years later she was signed by Hungarian giants Gy≈ëri ETO KC and got an excellent opportunity to train on one of the best academies in the country. She debuted in the Hungarian championship in 2001, but her playing minutes remained limited in the forthcoming years and she was eventually loaned to Budapest K≈ëb√°nyai Spartacus SC for the 2003‚Äì2004 season. After her comeback she slowly established herself as a regular, and on 23 March 2005 she won her first cap for the national team as well, when Hungary hosted Slovakia. Her contract in Gy≈ër ran out in summer 2009 and she decided not to extend it. She joined Podravka Koprivnica instead, as a replacement of Paula Ungureanu, who signed to CS Oltchim R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. In Croatia she got the chance to play together with national team mate Anita Bulath and former Gy≈ër player Ana √êokiƒá, under the guidance of world-class coach Zdravko Zovko. However, just few months after her move to Koprivnica, financial troubles were revealed and on 4 August the club announced that they release all their foreign players with immediate effect to axe the wage bills. She has not been a free agent for too long, just two weeks after her dismissal she signed a deal with V√°c. Herr told in an interview, that right after the official statement made by Podravka she got many calls and offers, and she had nothing else to do just choose the best one. In the summer of 2011 she moved to ambitious Si√≥fok KC alongside with other three Hungarian internationals, Szilvia √Åbrah√°m, Bernadett B√≥di and Ren√°ta M√∂rtel. However, just after one season she signed to her former club Gy≈ëri ETO as a replacement of the retiring Katalin P√°linger. International Herr debuted in the national team in 2005 and a year later she already took part on her first European Championship, finishing fifth. She participated on further two European Championships (2008, 2010) as well as two World Championships (2007, 2009). She was also present on the 2008 Summer Olympics, where Hungary placed fourth. Personal One of her two sisters, Anita, is also a Hungarian international handballer, playing in the right back position. They played together in Gy≈ër until 2009, and both of them were wanted by Podravka, but Anita finally moved to Germany. In 2012 they reunited in Si√≥fok KC for a brief period, following Anita left her club, VfL Sindelfingen, which went to bankruptcy, and joined the Balaton-side team.

Currently terminating at Cedar Lake, Manitoba, the delta is composed mainly of various types of wetlands, shallow lakes, and active and abandoned river channels bordered by forested natural levees. Sixty-five percent of the delta is occupied by vegetated wetlands, over one third of which comprise peat-forming fens and bogs.Ducks Unlimited Canada, 2010, Analysis of wetlands in the Saskatchewan River Delta based on Pasquia Project Enhanced Wetland Classification, Edmonton Alberta. Dirschl, H.J., 1972, Geobotanical processes in the Saskatchewan River Delta: Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 9:1529-1549. Geographically, the SRD consists of two parts---western and eastern---separated by a prominent moraine (The Pas Moraine) that was deposited by the Laurentide Ice Sheet during late stages of the Wisconsinan glacial epoch. These two components, commonly termed the \\"upper delta\\" and \\"lower delta\\", together occupy an area of approximately making the SRD one of the largest active inland delta in North America.Page 129 of: The broad wetland tracts of the upper delta in Saskatchewan are sometimes referred to as the Cumberland Marshes.Smith, N.D., Cross, T.A., Dufficy, J.P., and Clough, S.R., 1989, Anatomy of an avulsion: Sedimentology 36:1-23. Approximately 5% of the delta surface has been drained for agricultural use following feasibility studies by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration in the 1950s. The SRD is fed mainly by the Saskatchewan River, whose drainage basin extends westward to the continental divide and includes the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and much of the high plains region of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan River sensu stricto begins at the confluence of its two main tributaries, the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers, upstream from the head of the SRD. Approximately 80% of the flow to the delta comes from the Saskatchewan River whereas the other 20% is supplied by smaller streams that enter the SRD at its margins. These include the Torch, Mossy, Grassberry, Sturgeon-Weir, Carrot, and Pasquia Rivers. Most of the SRD is uninhabited, but approximately 15,000 people live in scattered communities around its perimeter, about two-thirds comprising Metis and First Nations peoples and one-third Euro-Canadian. Principal communities, including associated First Nations reserves, are The Pas, Moose Lake, and Cormorant (in Manitoba) and Cumberland House, Red Earth, and Shoal Lake (in Saskatchewan). Well over half of the delta population resides in and near The Pas, situated on The Pas Moraine between the upper and lower deltas. Geological and human history Like all deltas, the SRD formed by deposition of river-borne sediment into a standing body of water. Early stages of SRD development began some 10-11,000 years ago where the east-flowing Saskatchewan River entered the western shore of former Glacial Lake Agassiz, an enormous meltwater lake formed at the margins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet as it receded to the northeast. Schreiner, B.T., 1983, Lake Agassiz in Saskatchewan: in Teller, J.T., and Clayton, L, (eds), Glacial Lake Agassiz, Geological Association of Canada Special Paper 26, p. 75-96.Teller, J.T., and Leverington, D.W., 2004, Glacial Lake Agassiz: a 5000 yr history of change and its relationship to the Œ¥18O record of Greenland: Geological Society of America Bulletin 116:729-742. The delta expanded eastward as the lake shallowed by glacial rebound, eventually exposing the earlier-formed The Pas Moraine between 8200 and 8700 years ago. Morozova, G.S., and Smith, N.D., 1999, Holocene avulsion history of the lower Saskatchewan fluvial system, Cumberland Marshes, Saskatchewan- Manitoba, Canada: in Smith, N.D., and Rogers, J. (eds), Fluvial Sedimentology VI, International Association of Sedimentologists Special Publication 28, p. 231-249. Channel incision of the moraine followed, establishing through-flow of the Saskatchewan River and initiation of the lower delta. Growth of both the upper and lower components of the SRD has continued to the present, but now mostly by expansion of the lower delta into Cedar Lake, a remnant of Glacial Lake Agassiz, and to a lesser extent the delta of the Mossy River at Cumberland Lake north of Cumberland House. NASA image of the lower delta and nearby lakes As the SRD developed through time, the principal channels of the Saskatchewan River frequently changed courses (avulsed) as part of the normal process of delta evolution. In the upper delta alone, at least nine major avulsions have occurred in the past 5,400 years.Morozova, G.S., and Smith, N.D., 1999, Holocene avulsion history of the lower Saskatchewan fluvial system, Cumberland Marshes, Saskatchewan-Manitoba, Canada: in Smith, N.D., and Rogers, J. (eds), Fluvial Sedimentology VI, International Association of Sedimentologists Special Publication 28, p. 231-249. Remnants of these avulsions can be observed today as partly or wholly abandoned channels scattered over the delta surface. The most recent avulsion, initiated in the 1870s, has had profound effects on the physiography and ecosystems in the northwestern region of the delta. Smith, N.D., Slingerland, R.L., P√©rez- Arlucea, M., and Morozova, G.S., 1998, The 1870s avulsion of the Saskatchewan River: Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 35: 453-466. For example, Cumberland Lake, the largest lake in the SRD, has become shallower --- from pre-avulsion depths of over 6 meters to average depths of less than 1.5 meters today --- through sediment infilling following the avulsion. The 1870s event also contributed to the demise of sternwheeler riverboat traffic on the Saskatchewan River in the late 1800s and early 1900s because of difficulties in navigating through the modified channel networks resulting from the diversion.Peel, Bruce, 1972, Steamboats on the Saskatchewan: Prairie Books, The Western Producer, Saskatoon SK. Developmental and avulsion history of the lower delta is more poorly known although evidence of multiple historical channels is apparent from aerial photographs and satellite imagery. The SRD has a substantial history of pre-European occupation, Tamplin, M.J., 1977, Prehistoric occupation and resource exploitation on the Saskatchewan River at The Pas, Manitoba: PhD dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ and it has long served as a travel corridor and location for gathering centres for aboriginal peoples.Meyer, D., and Thistle, P. C., 1995, Saskatchewan River rendezvous centres and trading posts: continuity in a Cree social geography: Ethnohistory 42: 403-444. Because the Saskatchewan River is a major east-west river that connects the Rocky Mountains with the Atlantic Ocean (Hudson Bay, via Lake Winnipeg and the contiguous Nelson River), the SRD saw significant traffic during the 18th and 19th centuries from European exploration, fur trading, and commerce. Cumberland House, initially established in 1774 and now the oldest continuously occupied settlement in Saskatchewan, was a major crossroads of the fur-trading routes developed by the British-based Hudson's Bay Company and the Montreal-based North West Company. Habitat and biodiversity The diversity of wetlands in combination with the network of streams, lake ecosystems and terrestrial vegetation, make the Saskatchewan River Delta one of Canada‚Äôs richest regions for abundance and diversity of wildlife, especially large mammals (moose, elk, whitetail deer, black bear), fur-bearing mammals (notably muskrat, beaver, mink, otter, fisher, lynx, wolf), fish, waterfowl and other birds. Many of these species are vital to local aboriginal peoples who depend on fishing, hunting and trapping for means of livelihoods. Hunting and sport fishing also provide an important basis for local tourism. Dirschl and Dabbs Dirschl, H.J. and Dabbs, D.L., 1983, A contribution to the flora of the Saskatchewan River Delta: Canadian Wildlife Service report, Can. Field Nat., p. 212-228. documented 231 species of vascular plants and 14 species of bryophytes in the upper SRD. Specific to wetlands, other authors including Scoggan Scoggan, H.

Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada No. 184, Ottawa. and 6 species of amphibians and reptiles.Preston, W.B., 1982, The amphibians and reptiles of Manitoba. Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature, Winnipeg. Two species, Lake Sturgeon and the Yellow Rail, are identified respectively as Endangered Species and a Species of Concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Lake Sturgeon is currently being considered for listing under the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). The delta is a designated Canadian Important Bird Area of global significance,IBA Canada IBA Site Listing in part because of its large concentrations of waterfowl, and is home for an estimated half million breeding-season waterfowl each year. The SRD also serves as a valuable spring and fall staging area for waterfowl and other waterbirds traveling to and from the northern boreal and arctic regions. These include tundra swan, snow geese, and Canada geese. Because of the importance of the SRD in supporting healthy populations of aquatic fur bearers, marsh management activities (primarily for muskrats) date back to the 1930s when the Hudson's Bay Company initiated development of the Cumberland Marshes project area near Cumberland House in Saskatchewan. Private (Tom Lamb) and government interests conducted similar activities in Manitoba. Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC),Ducks Unlimited [www.ducks.ca] a private nonprofit conservation organization, also developed several wetland management projects dating back to the 1940s. Extensive projects were later undertaken in the 1960s and 70s following the construction of hydroelectric dams upstream and downstream of the delta (see following section). In more recent times, additional management projects have been developed in anticipation of continued habitat degradation. DUC currently manages several wetland areas in the SRD totaling approximately 3,000 km2 under conservation agreements with the two provincial governments, with input and guidance from local advisory committees. Environmental issues and concerns The SRD ecosystem is significantly affected by the presence of two large hydroelectric power dams constructed in the 1960s---one downstream of the delta at the outlet of Cedar Lake (Grand Rapids dam, Manitoba) and another on the Saskatchewan River 25 km upstream of the delta (E.B. Campbell dam, Saskatchewan). The Grand Rapids dam raised the surface of Cedar Lake by 3.5 m, modifying water levels in some 2500 km2 of the lower delta Partners FOR the Saskatchewan River Basin, 2009, From the mountains to the sea‚Äîthe state of the Saskatchewan River Basin. Meewasin Valley Authority, Saskatoon SK. Welcome to Sask River Basin and enlarging the open-water area of Cedar Lake to approximately 3500 km2. Lake surface levels typically range between 1.5 and 2 m each year in response to power needs and seasonal discharge variations. Following the development of the Grand Rapids project, the Manitoba government designated portions of the SRD as Wildlife Management Areas in recognition of these environmental impacts and as partial mitigation for habitat loss upstream of the dam. Most of the water supplying the SRD passes through the E.B. Campbell dam, which impounds nearly all river-borne sediment entering the reservoir (Tobin Lake) and modifies natural discharge fluctuations such that normally high spring and summer flows are significantly diminished. Partners FOR the Saskatchewan River Basin, 2009, From the Mountains to the Sea - The state of the Saskatchewan River Basin. Meewasin Valley Authority, Saskatoon SK. Welcome to Sask River Basin Removal of sediment outflow by impoundment has caused enlargement of channels downstream of the dam and reduction of sediment-borne nutrients to the delta ecosystem. In addition, suppression of annual discharge peaks has reduced the frequency of overbank flooding and, consequently, the frequency at which water and nutrients are replenished in the delta wetlands. Reduction of peak flows to the delta is exacerbated by the Gardiner dam on the South Saskatchewan River whose impoundment, Lake Diefenbaker, is nearly five times larger than the Tobin Lake reservoir, with a commensurately larger influence on flow patterns in the SRD. The other principal tributary, the North Saskatchewan River, is relatively little affected by dams. Flow hydrographs for the Saskatchewan River at The Pas indicate that mean annual discharges have declined approximately 25-30% since records were begun in 1913. This reduction is due in large part to upstream consumption, particularly irrigation projects in the South Saskatchewan River basin where consumption rates have grown significantly over the same time period. Seneka, M., 2004, Trends in historical annual flows for major rivers in Alberta. Report for Alberta Environment, p. 13-14. A long-term problem for the SRD wetland ecosystem is the prospect of continually declining inflows resulting from increased up-basin water consumption as populations and demands for water resources continue to grow in the future. In addition, the influence of climate change within the Saskatchewan River Basin will have an as yet uncertain impact on the SRD.Bruce, JP, Martin, H., Colucci, P. and 13 others, 2003, Climate change impacts on boundary and transboundary water management. Project A458/402, Climate Change Action Fund Project, Natural Resources Canada. Although agricultural reclamation currently affects only a small portion of the SRD, mostly near the Carrot River west of The Pas, modest expansion continues to take place in areas where wetlands have been drained. In the early 1980s, there was interest in expanding reclamation activities northward from the Carrot River in the east-central portion of the upper delta, but no such project has yet been initiated. Given the multiple jurisdictional (provincial and federal) responsibilities associated with both the Saskatchewan River and the SRD, there is growing concern that resource management and planning decisions affecting the delta will become more difficult to effectively coordinate in the face of increasing environmental stresses, especially declining water supplies. This, in conjunction with increasing interest and expectations by aboriginal communities to become more actively involved in such decisions, has posed the need for more collaborative planning approaches in the future.

That we needed to have a goal and that that goal would mean that we had to depend on other people to help us get there; which meant we couldn't waste our time and energy doing stupid things, getting into trouble.\\" Grevious participated in Girl Scouts and was involved in many social functions at the Charles Young Community Center, including dances, arts and crafts activities and talent shows. From an early age, she was inspired to become a teacher, citing her math teachers at Dunbar, Mrs. Claire Winda Taylor and Mrs. Ada Taylor (\\"the unofficial principal of Dunbar High school\\") as her role model for a future career in teaching. Grevious graduated in 1948 and remained active in fundraising efforts of the Dunbar Alumni Association which offers scholarships to promising students. College years After graduating from Dunbar, she enrolled in Kentucky State University in Frankfort, Kentucky in the fall of 1948. She would travel home every weekend, and seeing how tired her mother was from trying to support her, she quit school the following year to get a job. She worked as a secretary in the printing shop for the Town Crier, a Black newspaper in Lexington. It was during this time that Grevious began to realize the depth of racism and everyday discrimination in Kentucky: \\"It made me aware of how limited black America was within Lexington's society.\\"Graham, Arthur. \\"Ethnicity in Lexington Oral History Project.\\" Interview of Audrey Grevious by Arthur Graham, February 19, 1985. Print. Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History, University of Kentucky Libraries, Lexington, Kentucky. In 1955, after her brother returned from military service he had enough money to send himself, his wife and his sister to Kentucky State. Grevious graduated in 1957 with a degree in elementary education. During her college years she had become a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch chapter in Lexington, elected as secretary, and she was forced to give up her job at the Town Crier as well as another job she had at a department store. When she graduated from college, she became president of the Lexington NAACP. She attended the NAACP national convention in New York, and with some members from Ohio, agreed to participate in an experiment that would test White America's racism. She agreed that she would travel with some male NAACP members by car from New York to Lexington through Virginia and Maryland‚Äîand back again to New York. On the way to Kentucky, they drove \\"a fairly good little old car, not fancy or anything, just a good, old running car\\" and were dressed in their regular business professional clothes. Grevious described the reactions from White business owners when they stopped: \\"We weren't served any place. Now a couple of places said they would fix us some food in a box, in a sack if we came around to the back door to get it. Of course, naturally you were not going to do this. Then the plan was to get back to Lexington, the NAACP rented a limousine for us, furs for me, jewelry -- not African dress like they do now so much, but different. And I was to sit in the back, one young man was to be dressed up in a suit all the time and the other was to be the chauffeur. And we were to head back and stop at the very same places all the way back to New York. And we were served at every place that we stopped except one. And the conclusion that we came to was that they weren't quite sure who I was. Same people, we were still clean when we went before only this time I had some furs in the hot summertime wrapped around me and jewelry... so they were quite sure whether this was a foreigner coming through and they served us. ... this is what really got me into the serious part of making a change ... got me into the Movement one hundred and ten percent.\\" Educator and civil rights activist Grevious started teaching at a school for delinquent youths, Kentucky Village Reform School‚Äîlater called Greendale Reformatory (now the Blackburn Correctional Complex). While teaching grade school there she noticed how segregated the institution was and challenged the \\"separate but equal\\" policy by going with her students to eat lunch in the Whites-only cafeteria. Although she met with the superintendent many times, she was never fired, and eventually earned the position of head principal. While working at Kentucky Village, Grevious remained an active member of the NAACP and led many \\"picket line\\" protests against Lexington businesses that refused to hire or serve Blacks. In doing this she spurred a movement that led African Americans to positions they never held before. She was able to do all of this free of any crowd violence. Grevious worked closely with Julia Lewis, president of the local Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) chapter, and eventually became the vice-president of CORE also, bringing the two organizations together in order to establish social and economic justice. After leading many protests that displayed the inequality of African Americans in Lexington, Mrs. Grevious was able to accomplish what had not been possible in most areas across the south. She retired from teaching after she became principal at Maxwell Elementary School, and she remained an active NAACP member. Audrey Grevious recalled her legacy in several oral history interviews conducted by the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries. She died on January 6, 2017 at the age of 86. See also * NAACP in Kentucky References Additional resources * \\"Living the Story: The Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky ‚Äì Audrey Grevious\\".

His research into equality, practical reason, and the nature of the good has been very influential. His work on the intransitivity of the \\"all things considered better than\\"-relation is groundbreaking and challenges deeply held assumptions about value, practical reasoning, and the goodness of outcomes. His 1993 book InequalityLarry Temkin, Inequality, Oxford University Press, 1993. was described by the Times Literary Supplement as \\"brilliant and fascinating,\\" and as offering the reader more than any other book on the same subject. Biography Temkin graduated number one with a BA- Honors Degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1975, and received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University in 1983 under the supervision of Derek Parfit. He also studied at Oxford University in 1978-79. He began his professional career at Rice University, moving to Rutgers University in 2000. He has held Visiting Fellowships at the Australian National University, the National Institutes of Health, All Souls College (Oxford University), Harvard University‚Äôs Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, and the National Humanities Center. Temkin is a committed teacher who has won eight major teaching awards. In 2011-2012, and is the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Distinguished Teaching at Princeton University in the University Center for Human Values. Temkin is currently the chair of the Rutgers University philosophy department. This article describes Temkin's work on equality and on intransitivity and the nature of the good.  The nature of equality  Most work on equality asks whether equality is desirable, and, if so, what kind of equality we should seek. In Inequality, Temkin asks a more basic question: when is one situation worse than another with respect to inequality? Sometimes the answer is obvious, but sometimes it is not. Consider, for instance, three situations: one in which many are well off and just a few are badly off, one in which many are badly off and just a few are well off, and one in which there is an equal number of well off and badly off people. The first situation may be one in which a minority has been singled out for mistreatment, making the inequality seem especially gratuitous or cruel. The second situation may be one in which a dominant elite oppresses and exploits the masses. And the third situation seems to feature the greatest deviations from pure equality. Other things being equal, it is hard to say which situation is worst with respect to equality. A case, it seems, can be made for any of the three. Temkin uses such thought experiments to show that equality is not the simple notion it is often taken to be. Judgments of inequality's badness, he shows, turn on a host of considerations, such as how much deviation there is from pure equality, how gratuitous the inequality seems, and the extent to which individuals have an equality-based complaint. An individual's equality-based complaint, moreover, can depend on how she compares with the average person, the best off person, or all those better off than she; and, in addition, one might arrive at a judgment concerning the badness of an outcome‚Äôs inequality by adding individual complaints, focusing on the worst-off's complaints, or adding everyone's complaints, but giving special weight to larger complaints. In all, Temkin argues that at least eleven distinct aspects underlie egalitarian judgments. Temkin also challenges the conventional view that equality is holistic (that it is concerned mainly with groups) and that it is essentially distributive. While inequalities between groups can be important, Temkin argues that, often, the proper object of moral concern is inequalities between individuals. And while equality is indeed a distributive principle, Temkin argues that what makes it distinctive is that it is essentially comparative ‚Äì it expresses a fundamental concern for how individuals fare relative to each other. No other distributive principle, he argues, has that feature. In all, Temkin mounts a case against the conventional view that equality is simple, holistic, and essentially distributive, and a powerful case for the view that it is complex, individualistic, and essentially comparative.  Luck egalitarianism  Many contemporary egalitarians have been identified as luck egalitarians, believing, roughly, that it is bad when one person is worse off than another through no fault or choice of her own. Temkin argues that the egalitarian‚Äôs fundamental concern should not be with luck per se but with comparative fairness. His view is that, among equally deserving people, it is bad, because unfair, for some to be worse off than others through no fault or choice of their own. But, among unequally deserving people, it is not bad, because not unfair, for someone less deserving to be worse off than someone more deserving, even if the former is worse off through no fault or choice of her own. To illustrate, egalitarians need not object if criminal John is worse off than law-abiding Mary, even if John craftily avoided capture and is worse off only because, through no fault or choice of his own, a falling limb injured him. In that case the effects of luck need not trouble egalitarians because they do not undermine comparative fairness. On the other hand, egalitarians might well have reason to object if Betty injures herself saving a drowning child, and thus ends up worse off than others, even if the injury is a result of responsible free choice. One might object that, on Temkin‚Äôs view, egalitarian concerns reduce to concerns about desert. But Temkin offers arguments suggesting that this is not so. First, on Temkin‚Äôs view, it is important that equally deserving people fare equally well, even if, in absolute terms, they are not getting what they deserve. Suppose that Fred and Martha both deserve to fare badly, and equally badly, but they both fare well, and equally well. That would be bad from the perspective of absolute desert but not from the perspective of comparative desert. From the perspective of absolute desert, but not from the perspective of comparative desert, it would be better if just one of them fared badly. So, Temkin shows that the concern for comparative fairness is not the same as the concern about absolute desert. Second, Temkin further argues that the concern about comparative fairness is distinct from the concern about comparative desert. Suppose that Susan is a really good person who chooses to give most of her income to the badly off, and that John is a less good person who permissibly chooses to spend his money on himself. If Susan predictably ends up worse off than John, this would be objectionable from the standpoint of comparative desert, since Susan is a morally more deserving person than John; but Temkin suggests that there may be no egalitarian objection to Susan‚Äôs being worse off than John, on the grounds that there may be no comparative unfairness in their relative positions, given that Susan autonomously chose to make herself worse off than John.  Welfarism and the leveling down objection  Many reject egalitarianism because of the leveling down objection, which holds that there is no respect in which merely lowering someone from a higher to a lower level of welfare improves a situation, even if it increases equality. So, for example, it is argued that there is no respect in which putting out the eyes of the sighted would improve matters even though this would make everyone equally blind. If that is right, then equality would seem to lack intrinsic value. Temkin defends egalitarianism against the leveling down objection. He argues that this objection derives much of its force from a widespread assumption ‚Äì welfarism ‚Äì according to which nothing matters morally except insofar as it impacts individual wellbeing. That view, Temkin argues, is counter-intuitive. It seems bad, after all, for sinners to fare better than saints even if there is no respect in which that is worse for the sinners or the saints. In general, Temkin argues that we value fairness and justice beyond the extent to which they are good for people. Welfarism, he writes, rules out impersonal ideals ‚Äì those whose value does not lie wholly in their contributions to individual wellbeing ‚Äì and many of our most important ideals, such as that of fairness, justice, knowledge, beauty, and truth are impersonal. Of course, even if welfarism were false, it could still be the case that there is no respect in which leveling down the better off improves a situation. Temkin, however, thinks there is a respect in which this improves a situation ‚Äì it does so with respect to equality. That, of course, does not mean that leveling down the better off would make things better all things considered. Equality, Temkin argues, is not all that matters, but it matters some.  Equality and priority  Much recent work in political theory addresses whether egalitarianism should be replaced by prioritarianism. Prioritarians hold that an outcome‚Äôs goodness is a function of overall wellbeing across all individuals, with extra weight given to worse off individuals. This view first appeared under the name ‚Äúthe priority view‚Äù in Derek Parfit‚Äôs renowned 1991 article ‚ÄúEquality or Priority.‚Äù But the idea dates back to Temkin‚Äôs 1983 Ph.D. thesis, where it was presented under the name ‚Äúextended humanitarianism.‚Äù And the word ‚Äúprioritarianism‚Äù first appears in Temkin‚Äôs ‚ÄúEquality, Priority, and the Levelling Down Objection‚Äù. Prioritarianism has great plausibility. Many are drawn to the idea that making improvements in the wellbeing of the badly off should take priority over making equal improvements in the wellbeing of the well off. Prioritarianism, moreover, avoids the leveling down objection. Temkin, however, argues that it would be a mistake to jettison egalitarianism altogether since only egalitarianism reflects a fundamental concern for comparative fairness. There is an important place for egalitarian considerations in our all things considered judgments, Temkin argues, in addition to considerations of priority.  Intransitivity and the nature of the good  Beginning with his groundbreaking ‚ÄòIntransitivity and the Mere Addition Paradox,‚Äô and culminating in his magnum opus, Rethinking the Good: Moral Ideals, and the Nature of Practical Reasoning, Temkin has given a series of powerful arguments that call into question deeply held assumptions about value and about the nature of practical reasoning that play a central role in philosophy and in decision theory. According to decision theory, rational preferences must satisfy four fundamental axioms: Completeness (requiring preferences over, or indifference between, any pair of outcomes), Independence (requiring that one‚Äôs preference between a given pair of options does not depend on what other options are available), Continuity (requiring that if one prefers A to B and B to C, then one is indifferent between B and some gamble in which A and C are the two possible outcomes), and Transitivity (requiring that if you prefer A to B and B to C, then you prefer A to C). Temkin's arguments have called into question each one of these fundamental axioms, and his recent manuscript can be seen as a systematic account of the ways in which these axioms fail in cases involving moral reasoning. Thus, in addition to shedding light on the complexities of the moral domain, it arguably constitutes the most thorough challenge to the standard formal theory of practical rationality. The present article will focus on the challenges Temkin raises against transitivity, since this principle plays a fundamental and pervasive role not only in decision theory, but also in philosophical arguments and in our ordinary, informal practical reasoning. While this principle has a great deal of prima facie plausibility, Temkin has shown that we cannot consistently endorse this principle while retaining our other most deeply held beliefs about morality and rational choice. Here is an illustration of the problem. Most people accept a position that Temkin calls the First Standard View (FSV), which holds, roughly, that an outcome in which some people suffer a burden would be better than an outcome where many more people suffer a slightly smaller burden. So, for example, other things equal, an outcome where some number of people suffered from a given illness would be better than one where far more people suffered from an illness that was almost as bad. Most people also accept a position he calls the Second Standard View (SSV), which holds, roughly, that an outcome where a number of people suffer an extremely severe burden would be worse than one where any number of people suffer a minor burden. For example, most believe that, other things equal, an outcome in which ten people are severely tortured for their entire lives would be worse than an outcome in which any number of people must listen to a mildly unpleasant pop tune. And yet, as Temkin has shown, these two deeply held beliefs are incompatible with Transitivity, in an argument that owes much to the Repugnant Conclusion. For there could be a spectrum of burdens ranging from the very severe to the very mild, such that FSV applies when comparing outcomes involving burdens near each other on the spectrum, while SSV applies when comparing outcomes involving burdens at opposite ends of the spectrum. Thus, FSV tells us that outcome A, where 10 people are severely tortured for their whole lives, would be better than outcome B, where 30 people suffer a burden almost as bad as (perhaps being severely tortured all their lives except for Sunday afternoons when they can watch football); that B would be better than outcome C, where 90 people suffer a burden almost as bad as the burden suffered in B, and so on. Continuing in this way, transitivity will entail that A, an outcome where 10 people are tortured for their whole lives, is better than some outcome Z, where some very large number of people must listen to a mildly unpleasant pop tune once per month. But SSV denies this. Thus, one must reject FSV, SSV, or the Axiom of Transitivity; but none of these will be easy to give up. According to Temkin's diagnosis of this paradox, FSV reflects the fact that sometimes we adopt an additive- aggregationist approach in evaluating and comparing different outcomes. That is, we judge the relative goodness of two outcomes by comparing them in terms of both the quality and number of benefits or burdens and adding them up. On the other hand, SSV reflects the fact that sometimes we adopt an anti- additive-aggregationist approach in evaluating and comparing different outcomes. That is, for some comparisons, we do not simply add up the benefits and burdens in the different outcomes, but instead pay attention to how the benefits or burdens are distributed in the different outcomes and, in particular, to the relative impact on people's lives that the benefits and burdens have. Temkin has shown, however, that if we apply one set of criteria for making certain comparisons, and another set for making others, then the Axiom of Transitivity will either fail, or fail to apply, across the different comparisons. In particular, if it is FSV that is relevant when comparing A with B, and B with C, and if it is instead SSV that is relevant when comparing A with C, then it will not be surprising if A is better than B, and B better than C, in terms of the criteria that are relevant for making those comparisons, but A is not better than C, in terms of the criteria that are relevant for making that comparison. Thus, Temkin has provided a plausible and powerful explanation of how failures of transitivity can arise when comparing various outcomes, in virtue of the different factors that can be relevant in comparing different outcomes. Temkin has shown that the same logic that applies when comparing distributions of benefits and burdens across populations also applies when comparing such distributions within a single life. Thus, most believe that an analogue of FSV is relevant for comparing certain possible lives, but that an analogue of SSV is relevant for comparing others. For example, in some cases we accept an additive-aggregationist approach, agreeing that it would be better to live a life with a larger burden lasting for a certain duration, than a life with a burden almost as bad lasting much longer. But in other cases we reject an additive-aggregationist approach, holding, for example, that no matter how long we might live, it would be better to have to listen to one mildly unpleasant pop tune per month for any number of months, than two years of continuous excruciating torture. Two years of torture within a life is tragic. But lots of mildly unpleasant pop tunes spread out through time never amount to more than a nuisance; they simply do not add up in the way required to outweigh the tragic impact of two years of torture. And yet, as Temkin has shown, these two assumptions about how to evaluate possible lives lead to intransitivities similar to those considered above. The kinds of argument Temkin gives against transitivity are very broad in their scope. For they will apply whenever the principles that are relevant, or the weight that we should assign to these principles, depends on which outcomes we are comparing. And Temkin has persuasively argued that the relevant principles do vary from comparison to comparison. Thus, there are some \\"narrowly person-affecting principles,\\" as Temkin calls them, that apply only when one is comparing outcomes in which there is either partial or total overlap among the individuals they contain, whereas there are other principles, such as the principle of total utility, that apply when comparing outcomes containing wholly different populations. Since most people will want to give some weight both to kinds of principles, most people must acknowledge that which principles are relevant in making different comparisons depends on which outcomes are being compared. Temkin has shown, however, that once this kind of variability has been acknowledged, the threat of intransitivity looms. One objection that has been made to Temkin‚Äôs arguments is that, simply as a matter of logic, \\"better than\\" could never be intransitive. Such critics often grant, however, that since context is relevant to our obligations, it could be that we ought to do A rather than B, when those are our only alternatives, and do B rather than C, when those are our only alternatives, and yet we ought to do C rather than A, when those are our only alternatives. Temkin has shown, however, that if the critics acknowledge this point about obligations, then it will be very difficult for them to maintain that the \\"better than\\" relation is transitive. For it is very plausible that acting rightly is good in itself, quite apart from the value of whatever consequences it may bring about. In order for this to create problems for the defender of transitivity, it need not be the case that, as Kant thought, the intrinsic moral worth of actions is more important than their consequences‚Äîit suffices that, when agents act rightly rather than wrongly, this fact has some intrinsic value, however small. Temkin shows that if we grant even this much, then it is very difficult to maintain the transitivity of the value of outcomes, since the intransitivity among our obligations to choose will infect the outcomes we are choosing among. What these arguments show is that many of our deepest beliefs regarding how to assess the goodness of outcomes are fundamentally incompatible. In light of these arguments, it appears that, if we are to achieve consistency in our normative beliefs, then very serious revisions are required in our understanding of the good and of practical reasoning.

Ongoing HASS screening assures that any weak components or manufacturing process degradations are quickly detected and corrected. HASS is not intended to be a rigid process that has an endpoint. It is a dynamic process that may need modification or adjustment over the life of the product. HASS aids in the detection of early life failures. HASA's primary purpose is to monitor manufacturing and prevent any defects from being introduced during the process.

D. H. Cole, p.113 He studied at Southend High School for Boys, for which he wrote the lyrics for the school song, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he achieved first class honours in English and History. He was also President of the Cambridge Union Society and an accomplished athlete, representing Cambridge in the half-mile against Oxford in 1927.Professor Lionel Elvin - Obituaries, News - The Independent After a two-year Commonwealth Fund Fellowship at Yale, Elvin returned to Trinity Hall in 1930 as the college's first Fellow with responsibility for teaching English (he was tutor to both Marshall McLuhan and Raymond Williams while he was there). He became the Senior Treasurer of the then newly formed Cambridge University Labour Club in Easter Term 1934. In 1934, he also married Mona Bedortha Dutton (died 1997; one son). His interest in education was broadened by membership of Cambridge Town Council and by the work of Henry Morris, chief education officer for Cambridgeshire, who was the creator of \\"village colleges\\" in the county. Elvin was also active in the Workers' Educational Association and served as Treasurer of its Eastern District. Elvin was a man of the left, a radical and a \\"non-Christian\\"; his adherence to his principles led him to refuse numerous honours, although he did accept the honorary fellowships awarded to him by Trinity Hall and the Institute of Education. He was a person of great charm and modesty (his Who's Who entry included under recreations \\"most games indifferently\\"). He was also the first Chairman of Amnesty International. Elvin was a tireless worker and active in numerous educational causes, for example: *President of the English New Education Fellowship *President of the Council for Education in World Citizenship *Chair of the Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee.

It was designed by Chris James and published by Stratus Games.Gold Mine product page In the game, players excavate a maze of mine tunnels by placing tiles that represent the features of an underground mine. Players also control miniature miners who traverse the mine collecting gold. In addition, miners can traverse secret passages, challenge other miners for gold, and direct bats toward other miners to chase them away from their current position in the mine. The object of the game is to be the first to collect a certain number of gold nuggets and exit the mine.Official Gold Mine rules  Components  * 100 game tiles ** 1 Mine Entrance tile ** 28 Gold Chamber tiles ** 67 Mine Tunnel tiles ** 4 Cavern tiles * 28 Gold Nuggets * 18 Gold Challenge tokens * 18 Bat Challenge tokens * 6 Miners * 2 dice The Miners are plastic miniatures that are roughly 1 inches tall and 1/2 inch in diameter. The Miners consist of various colors (red, green, blue, yellow, black and white) and depict a pudgy, faceless miner complete with overalls, large boots, pickaxe and helmet with a head lamp. The Gold Nuggets are durable plastic gold nugget-shaped pieces that are roughly 1/2 inch long in all directions. Each game tile is 1.75 inches square and 2 millimeters thick. The Mine Tunnel and Gold Chamber tiles contain various configurations of tunnels, with each side having zero, one, or two exposed mine tunnels. The Cavern tiles depict a natural cavern, complete with stalactites. Gold Chambers depict a large room with golden floors and walls to represent a gold vein. The Mine Entrance tile depicts an open space, similar to a Cavern, with a ladder leading out of the mine and an 'Exit' sign. All tiles share the Gold Mine logo on the reverse side, except for the Mine Entrance, which depicts an exterior mine entrance with an \\"Enter\\" sign and a ladder leading down into the mine. Both types of Challenge tokens are 3/4 inches in diameter and 2 millimeters thick. Gold Challenge tokens depict a Gold Nugget placed in front of two criss-crossing pickaxes. Bat Challenge tokens depict a group of attacking bats.  Setup  Game setup consists of shuffling all of the tiles and forming several stacks of tiles, face down. A stack of exactly 20 tiles is used first for the Development Mining phase of the game. Each player chooses a Miner and is dealt three of each type of Challenge token. A starting player is then chosen and the game begins.  Game Play  Players begin the game by placing 20 tiles to form the initial mine configuration. The Mine Entrance tile serves as the starting tile. Valid tile placement consists of placing tiles along a grid formation so that mine tunnels and walls on all adjacent tiles connect properly. Cavern tiles can be placed adjacent to any tile, regardless of the tunnel formation. Any tile with a single or double mine tunnel configuration may be placed next to the Mine Entrance tile, as long as none of the tunnels are blocked or form a loop. Whenever a Gold Chamber tile is placed, a Gold Nugget is immediately placed on the center of the tile for later collection by a Miner. After the first 20 tiles have been placed, players place their Miner on the Mine Entrance tile and try to collect the required number of Gold Nuggets (which ranges from 5 to 10, depending on the number of players). A valid turn consists of a Miner Movement phase and a Miner Action phase. During the Miner Movement phase, a player may choose one of the following movement options: * Place a tile and move one space * Roll a single die and move up to that number * Traverse a Secret Passage Miners move through connected tunnels on adjacent tiles, with each tile boundary costing one movement point. Miners may pass each other during movement, but may not jump across gaps between disconnected tunnels. Water-carved Secret Passages are found on 15 different tiles and are represented by a crevice and puddle of water. A Miner must be standing next to a Secret Passage at the beginning of a turn in order to attempt to traverse it. To traverse a Secret Passage, both dice are rolled. If doubles or a sum of seven is rolled, the Miner may traverse safely. If not, the Miner may move up to the lower number rolled in the usual manner. After the Miner Movement phase is finished, the Miner Action phase occurs, in which the player may collect a Gold Nugget and/or initiate a Challenge against another player. To initiate a Challenge, a player must declare which player is being challenged and discard either a Gold Challenge or Bat Challenge token. Each type of challenge requires both the challenger and defender to roll a die three times in a row. The winner is the player who rolled higher two out of the three rolls (with ties going to the challenger). A Gold Challenge allows a player to attempt to dislodge a Gold Nugget from another Miner who is currently standing in the same location. The winner of the Challenge collects a Gold Nugget from the loser and places it on any empty Gold Chamber tile. If the challenger is the winner, the player may roll a single die and move up to the number rolled (in order to attempt to collect the gold first). A Bat Challenge allows a player to attempt to direct bats toward any other Miner, anywhere in the mine, in order to chase him away from his current position. The winner of the Challenge may roll a single die and move the other player's Miner up to the number rolled.  Winning the Game  The first player who collects at least the required number of Gold Nuggets and returns to the Mine Entrance tile wins the game. For 2 players, 10 gold nuggets are required; for 3 to 4 players, 7 are required; for 5 to 6 players, 5 are required.

Perylene dyes  The basic structure of perylene pigments. Perylene dyes are useful for their intense visible light absorption, high stability, electron accepting ability, and unity quantum yields.Huang, C., Barlow,S., Marder, S.

A bathochromic shift of about 100 nm is recorded per additional naphthalene unit. Synthesis Perylenediimide (PDI) are synthesized by treating perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) with amines at high temperatures. Synthetic scheme for synthesizing symmetrically N,N'-substituted perylene diimide This reaction forms symmetrically N,N‚Äô- substituted PDIs. Solubilizing groups are often attached in this fashion. Although the solubility of the dianhydride is low, the solubility of some mono- and diimide derivatives are greatly improved. Applications Pigments Perylene diimide derivatives were initially developed as industrial dyes due to their excellent chemical, photo, thermal, and weather stability. Nowadays, perylene dyes are used predominantly in textile applications and as high-grade industrial paint.K. Hunger. W. Herbst \\"Pigments, Organic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2012.

Perylene Red PR149 Several perylene pigments have been developed for artist's paints : * Pigment Violet 29 (PV29), red purple, bordeaux. 100px * Pigment red 149, a middle red, between light and dark cadmium red. (chemical structure: replace HN group in PV29 with 3,5-(CH3)2C6H3). * Pigment Red 179, which is close to alizarin crimson (chemical structure: replace HN group in PV29 with CH3N). * Perylene black 31 (chemical structure: replace HN group in PV29 with C6H5CH2CH2N) Protein tagging Rylene dyes have been less popular as a fluorescent tag due to their low solubility in aqueous solutions. However, there has been much progress in tailoring rylene probes to this application. An advantage of using rylene dyes is that different functional groups can be placed in the imide structure and in the bay region. This has allowed polar carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups to be added to make rylene dyes more soluble. The imide structure allows for two different substituent, so a single reactive group can be attached to this position. Organic field effect transistors Perylenediimide derivatives can be used as n-channel field- effect transistors due to their strong electron affinities. In particular, OFETs using highly packed perylene diimide derivatives with electron withdrawing groups such were found to have high air stability.Jones, B. A.; Ahrens, M.

Eugenio Tr√≠as Sagnier (31 August 1942 ‚Äì 10 February 2013Muere Eugenio Tr√≠as, un fil√≥sofo que quiso llevar el pensamiento m√°s all√° del l√≠mite) was a Spanish philosopher. He is regarded by the majority of the critics as the most important thinker since Ortega y GassetAmong others, Jos√© Manuel Mart√≠nez Pulet in his PH.D. dissertation (2000, UAM); Andres Sanchez Pascual, Juan Antonio Rodr√≠guez Tous and twelve other writers in Limit, symbol and shadow (Barcelona, Destino, 2003); Fernando P√©rez- Borbujo in The other side of beauty (Barcelona, Herder, 2006); Jacobo Mu√±oz, Francisco Jose Martin and other critics in a reading on The philosophy of the limit. A debate with Eugenio Tr√≠as (Madrid, Biblioteca Nueva, 2007); and Arash Arjomandi, in his PH.D. dissertation (2005, UPF). in the philosophical literature written in Spanish.  Biography  Trias was born in Barcelona. After obtaining his bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the University of Barcelona in 1964, he continued his studies in Pamplona, Madrid, Bonn and Cologne. Since 1965 he was Assistant Professor and, later, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Barcelona (UB) and the Universitat Aut√≤noma of Barcelona (UAB). In 1972 he stayed, for one year, in Brazil and Argentina, where he offered several courses and lectures. In 1976 he became Assistant Professor of Aesthetics and Composition at the School of Architecture of Barcelona. In 1986 he gained the Chair of Philosophy at this University, where he remained until 1992. In 1992 he became Chair Professor of Philosophy at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, where he remained as a Professor of History of Ideas until his death, aged 70, in his home city.  Thought  He had an encyclopedical conception of philosophy and spread his ideas in very diverse fields such as ethics, politics, aesthetics, philosophy of religion, philosophy of history, theory of knowledge, and ontology. He dealt with almost every field where philosophy can be applied. His preferred fields, nevertheless, were, above all, Philosophy of Arts and Aesthetics, on the one hand, and Philosophy of Religion, on the other. He always tried to derive his whole thought from his own personal conception of ontology, which is usually called the ‚ÄúPhilosophy of Limit‚Äù. Many of his books have already become obligatory references in the Spanish written philosophical heritage of the last 60 years. Some of his works such as Treaty on Passion, Beauty and the Sinister, The World's limits or The Age of the Spirit have become classics of the Spanish written philosophical thought of the 20th century. His work is regarded by the criticsFor instance, the newspaper ABC, August 27, 2002 as one of two most significant philosophical pillars of the contemporary Spanish thought. Critics have praised his work for his particular style of writing (in which the philosophical thought gets poetic antennas with a great literary value). His works have been regarded not only a very important contribution to the Spanish philosophical and cultural heritage, but also an enormous textual production that will remain as one of the most reliable milestones of his generation in the fields of the philosophical literature and of the knowledge- oriented writing. Trias published over thirty-five books, some of which have had several editions in Spain and abroad. His first book, The Philosophy and its shadow, published in 1969, was hailed by critics as an event in the Spanish cultural life. It was regarded as \\"the philosophy of a new generation\\" (Josep Maria Carandell). In his latest two books The Sirens Chant ‚Äìwhich has become a non-fiction bestseller in Spain‚Äì and The Sonorous Imagination Trias held that there is a need of a musical turn in the philosophy of the 21st century to make thought change its gravity center, to musical aspects instead of language, since the former represents the most perfect synthesis of beauty and knowledge.Barcelona, Random House, 2007  The main topics of his Philosophy  According to the most recent book on Trias, Reason and revelation,Arash Arjomandi, Barcelona, Ediciones ElCobre, 2007 these have been ‚Äìin chronological order‚Äì the main topics of Trias philosophical works: ‚Ä¢ The shadows of the philosophical theories ‚Ä¢ The reason of the irrational ‚Ä¢ The artists and their society ‚Ä¢ The Sinister as the limit and condition of beauty ‚Ä¢ Passionate love as the basis of intelligence ‚Ä¢ The Modernity crisis ‚Ä¢ The human condition as a bordering existence ‚Ä¢ The religious experience ‚Ä¢ The beauty and the sacred ‚Ä¢ A new ethics as an ethics of limit ‚Ä¢ The musical turn of the Philosophy  His main contributions to Philosophy  As an alternative to a narrow-minded rationalism ‚Äìsuch as the logical positivism, the analytical philosophy or the Marxist thought‚Äì, Trias, who has never been an irrationalist philosopher, intended to extend reason to those spheres which are still reluctant to it, although they can somehow impregnate it.Jose M. Mart√≠nez Pulet, Variations of the limit, Madrid, Noesis, 2002 Some examples of these spheres are: the irrationality and the madness (in his book Philosophy and carnival); the mythical and magical thought (in his book Methodology of magical thought); the passionate love (in his book Treaty on passion); the Sinister (in his book The beauty and the sinister) as a shade of the categories of beauty and the sublime which founded the traditional aesthetics; or the world of religions as the shadow of the modern Western reason (as shown in his The age of the Spirit). That is the reason why Eugenio Trias considers himself as an \\"illuminist exorcist\\" who exposes the philosophical reason to a permanent dialogue with their shadows. But the most significant innovation of Tr√≠as philosophy appeared in the early 1980s, when he found out the cornerstone of his Philosophy, namely, the concept of limes (or, \\"limit\\"). He stated that being (whose issue has always been the main question for Western philosophy from its origins) may be understood as ‚Äúbeing of limit‚Äù, that is, the border area that separates as well joins the phenomena and the noumena. Whereas in Kant's thought there was not such a limit or borderline that merges and splits the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself, Trias held that such a limit exists. He stated that it is a precarious, delicate, subtle but founding isthmus. And it is just the very being that philosophers intend to define. That limit is also the boundary between the reason and its shadows. His concept of the limit is the result of an intense dialogue with the Kantian tradition, Wittgenstein and Heidegger. In fact, all his work is a very developed commentary on the Wittgenstein's statement \\"subject is a limit of the world.\\" Trias develops an anthropology in which the person is conceived as an inhabitant of the being's limit. On this respect, person is always referred to the abovementioned limit which for Trias has an ontological significance.See Arash Arjomandi, op. cit.; J.M. Mart√≠nez Pulet, op.cit., Fernando P√©rez-Borbujo, op. cit.  Prizes and awards  Trias won many prizes and awards for his creative work. Among them, these are the most important ones: ‚Ä¢ In 1974 he received the New Critics Award for his book Drama and identity ‚Ä¢ In 1975 he received the Anagrama Essay Award for The artist and the city ‚Ä¢ In 1983 he was awarded with the Spanish National Essay Prize for Beauty and the sinister ‚Ä¢ In 1995 he received the Ciutat de Barcelona Award, for The age of the Spirit ‚Ä¢ In 1995 he won the 13th Friedrich Nietzsche Prize for his collected philosophical works. This award (won also by other distinguished thinkers such as Popper, Rorty or Derrida) is, in its absence, an equivalent to the Nobel Prize of Philosophy, due to the fact that it is the only international award given to a philosopher in recognition of his entire career. Eugenio Trias is the only philosopher in Spanish language who has received this award. ‚Ä¢ In 1997 he was awarded with the Medal of the City of Buenos Aires ‚Ä¢ In 2000 the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) gave Trias an Honoris Causa Doctorate ‚Ä¢ In 2003 the National University of San Marcos Lima (UNMSM) gave him an Honoris Causa Doctorate ‚Ä¢ In 2004 he received the Gold Medal of the very prestigious Circulo de Bellas Artes de Madrid ‚Ä¢ In 2006 the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) gave Trias ‚Äìtogether with Jose Saramago‚Äì an Honoris Causa Doctorate ‚Ä¢ In 2007 his best-seller book The Sirens chant\\" received two awards as the best essay of the Year: the Terenci Moix and the Qwerty prizes ‚Ä¢ In 2009 he received the Mariano de Cavia Award, for his article The great travel, published by the ABC newspaper ‚Ä¢ In 2010 he received the Creation Prize of Extremadura, a very prestigious official award ‚Ä¢ He has been Vice-president of the Reina Sofia National Museum (Madrid) and Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Institute of Philosophy at the Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas of Spain.

The castle stands on a volcanic rocky islet that connects to the larger island of Ischia by a causeway ('). The castle was built by Hiero I of Syracuse in 474 BC. At the same time, two towers were built to control enemy fleets' movements. The rock was then occupied by Parthenopeans (the ancient inhabitants of Naples). In 326 BC the fortress was captured by Romans, and then again by the Parthenopeans. In 1441 Alfonso V of Aragon connected the rock to the island with a stone bridge instead of the prior wood bridge, and fortified the walls in order to defend the inhabitants against the raids of pirates. Around 1700, about 2000 families lived on the islet, including a Poor Clares convent, an abbey of Basilian monks (of the Greek Orthodox Church), the bishop and the seminar, the prince with a military garrison. There were also thirteen churches. In 1809, the British troops laid siege to the island, then under French command, and shelled it to almost complete destruction. In 1912, the castle was sold to a private owner. Today the castle is the most visited monument of the island. It is accessed through a tunnel with large openings which let the light enter.

Here a mutual fund refers to any specified benchmark portfolio of the available assets. There are two advantages of having a mutual fund theorem. First, if the relevant conditions are met, it may be easier (or lower in transactions costs) for an investor to purchase a smaller number of mutual funds than to purchase a larger number of assets individually. Second, from a theoretical and empirical standpoint, if it can be assumed that the relevant conditions are indeed satisfied, then implications for the functioning of asset markets can be derived and tested. Portfolio separation in mean-variance analysis Portfolios can be analyzed in a mean-variance framework, with every investor holding the portfolio with the lowest possible return variance consistent with that investor's chosen level of expected return (called a minimum-variance portfolio), if the returns on the assets are jointly elliptically distributed, including the special case in which they are jointly normally distributed. Under mean-variance analysis, it can be shown that every minimum-variance portfolio given a particular expected return (that is, every efficient portfolio) can be formed as a combination of any two efficient portfolios. If the investor's optimal portfolio has an expected return that is between the expected returns on two efficient benchmark portfolios, then that investor's portfolio can be characterized as consisting of positive quantities of the two benchmark portfolios. No risk-free asset To see two-fund separation in a context in which no risk-free asset is available, using matrix algebra, let \\\\sigma^2 be the variance of the portfolio return, let \\\\mu be the level of expected return on the portfolio that portfolio return variance is to be minimized contingent upon, let r be the vector of expected returns on the available assets, let X be the vector of amounts to be placed in the available assets, let W be the amount of wealth that is to be allocated in the portfolio, and let 1 be a vector of ones. Then the problem of minimizing the portfolio return variance subject to a given level of expected portfolio return can be stated as :Minimize \\\\sigma^2 :subject to :X^Tr = \\\\mu :and :X^T1 = W where the superscript ^T denotes the transpose of a matrix. The portfolio return variance in the objective function can be written as \\\\sigma^2 = X^TVX, where V is the positive definite covariance matrix of the individual assets' returns. The Lagrangian for this constrained optimization problem (whose second-order conditions can be shown to be satisfied) is :L = X^TVX + 2\\\\lambda(\\\\mu - X^Tr) + 2\\\\eta (W-X^T1), with Lagrange multipliers \\\\lambda and \\\\eta.This can be solved for the optimal vector X of asset quantities by equating to zero the derivatives with respect to X, \\\\lambda, and \\\\eta, provisionally solving the first-order condition for X in terms of \\\\lambda and \\\\eta, substituting into the other first-order conditions, solving for \\\\lambda and \\\\eta in terms of the model parameters, and substituting back into the provisional solution for X. The result is :X^\\\\mathrm{opt} = \\\\frac{W}{\\\\Delta}[(r^TV^{-1}r)V^{-1}1 - (1^TV^{-1}r)V^{-1}r] + \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\Delta}[(1^TV^{-1}1)V^{-1}r - (r^TV^{-1}1)V^{-1}1] where ::\\\\Delta = (r^TV^{-1}r)(1^TV^{-1}1) - (r^TV^{-1}1)^2 > 0. For simplicity this can be written more compactly as :X^\\\\mathrm{opt} = \\\\alpha W + \\\\beta \\\\mu where \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are parameter vectors based on the underlying model parameters. Now consider two benchmark efficient portfolios constructed at benchmark expected returns \\\\mu_1 and \\\\mu_2 and thus given by :X_{1}^\\\\mathrm{opt} = \\\\alpha W + \\\\beta \\\\mu_1 and :X_{2}^\\\\mathrm{opt} = \\\\alpha W + \\\\beta \\\\mu_2. The optimal portfolio at arbitrary \\\\mu_3 can then be written as a weighted average of X_{1}^\\\\mathrm{opt} and X_{2}^\\\\mathrm{opt} as follows: :X_{3}^\\\\mathrm{opt} = \\\\alpha W + \\\\beta \\\\mu_3 = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_3 - \\\\mu_2}{\\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_2}X_{1}^\\\\mathrm{opt} + \\\\frac{\\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_3}{\\\\mu_1 - \\\\mu_2}X_{2}^\\\\mathrm{opt}. This equation proves the two-fund separation theorem for mean-variance analysis. For a geometric interpretation, see the Markowitz bullet. One risk-free asset If a risk- free asset is available, then again a two-fund separation theorem applies; but in this case one of the \\"funds\\" can be chosen to be a very simple fund containing only the risk-free asset, and the other fund can be chosen to be one which contains zero holdings of the risk-free asset. (With the risk-free asset referred to as \\"money\\", this form of the theorem is referred to as the monetary separation theorem.) Thus mean-variance efficient portfolios can be formed simply as a combination of holdings of the risk-free asset and holdings of a particular efficient fund that contains only risky assets. The derivation above does not apply, however, since with a risk-free asset the above covariance matrix of all asset returns, V, would have one row and one column of zeroes and thus would not be invertible. Instead, the problem can be set up as :Minimize \\\\sigma^2 :subject to :(W-X^T1)r_f + X^Tr = \\\\mu, where r_f is the known return on the risk-free asset, X is now the vector of quantities to be held in the risky assets, and r is the vector of expected returns on the risky assets. The left side of the last equation is the expected return on the portfolio, since (W-X^T1) is the quantity held in the risk-free asset, thus incorporating the asset adding-up constraint that in the earlier problem required the inclusion of a separate Lagrangian constraint. The objective function can be written as \\\\sigma^2 = X^TVX, where now V is the covariance matrix of the risky assets only. This optimization problem can be shown to yield the optimal vector of risky asset holdings :X^\\\\mathrm{opt} = \\\\frac{(\\\\mu - Wr_f)}{(r-1r_f)^TV^{-1}(r-1r_f)}V^{-1}(r-1r_f). Of course this equals a zero vector if \\\\mu = Wr_f, the risk-free portfolio's return, in which case all wealth is held in the risk-free asset. It can be shown that the portfolio with exactly zero holdings of the risk-free asset occurs at \\\\mu = \\\\tfrac{Wr^TV^{-1}(r-1r_f)}{1^TV^{-1}(r-1r_f)} and is given by :X^* = \\\\frac{W}{1^TV^{-1}(r-1r_f)}V^{-1}(r-1r_f). It can also be shown (analogously to the demonstration in the above two-mutual-fund case) that every portfolio's risky asset vector (that is, X^\\\\mathrm{opt} for every value of \\\\mu) can be formed as a weighted combination of the latter vector and the zero vector. For a geometric interpretation, see the efficient frontier with no risk-free asset. Portfolio separation without mean-variance analysis If investors have hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) (including the power utility function, logarithmic function and the exponential utility function), separation theorems can be obtained without the use of mean-variance analysis. For example, David Cass and Joseph Stiglitz showed in 1970 that two-fund monetary separation applies if all investors have HARA utility with the same exponent as each other.Huang, Chi-fu, and Robert H. Litzenberger, Foundations for Financial Economics, North-Holland, 1988. More recently, in the dynamic portfolio optimization model of √áanakoƒülu and √ñzekici, the investor's level of initial wealth (the distinguishing feature of investors) does not affect the optimal composition of the risky part of the portfolio. A similar result is given by Schmedders.Schmedders, Karl H.

The term is typically used in reference to college athletics in the United States. Because superconferences are emergent and not clearly defined, the term is often used in a hypothetical and speculative way, although one definition of American college superconferences posits that they must form from leagues that were Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conferences during the era of the now-defunct Bowl Championship Series, possess a significant multi-network television deal, and at least consider expanding to the \\"magic number\\" of 16 members. The term, though used infrequently before 2010, has historical roots in the proposed \\"Airplane Conference\\" of 1959, the Metro Conference's 1990 plan to expand to 16 members, the expansion of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) to 16 members in 1996, and the creation of 12-team, two-division conferences with football championship games by the Southeastern Conference (SEC), Big 12 Conference, and Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the 1990s and 2000s. Since major conference realignment began in 2010, the term has been used to describe the expanding ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC conferences.  Background   The proposed \\"Airplane Conference\\" (1959)  Although the term was not used at the time, perhaps the first superconference was the proposed \\"Airplane Conference\\" of 1959. The brainchild of University of Pittsburgh Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, the proposed 13 team conference would have stretched across the United States. It would have consisted of five former members of the Pacific Coast Conference (Washington, California, USC, UCLA and Stanford), the three largest service academies (Army, Navy, and Air Force), and four Eastern universities (Notre Dame, Pitt, Penn State, Syracuse). The \\"Airplane Conference\\" failed to form after the service academies backed out because of the Pentagon's opposition to the idea.Dunnavant, Keith. \\"The 50 Year Seduction.\\" Thomas Dunne Books: New York, 2004  \\"Developing the Super Conference\\" (1990)  In 1990, Raycom Sports created a 240-page booklet for the now-defunct Metro Conference entitled \\"Developing the Super Conference\\". The booklet outlined Raycom's plan to make the Metro competitive with the major conferences of the day (chiefly the SEC, ACC, Southwest, Big Eight, Big Ten, and Pac-10), which was based on adding new members that were desirable to the Metro in terms of everything from tapping new television markets and increasing the conference's footprint to preserving regional rivalries and exhibiting \\"institutional compatibility\\". Raycom's plan was for the Metro, which consisted of eight members in 1990 (Cincinnati, Florida State, Louisville, Memphis State, South Carolina, Southern Miss, Tulane, and Virginia Tech), to double in size to 16, sponsor football for the first time, and then split into either two divisions of eight or four divisions of four. The eight teams named as targets in the booklet were Boston College, East Carolina, Miami, Pitt, Rutgers, Syracuse, Temple, and West Virginia, and Raycom's plan was so intriguing to them that the presidents and athletic directors from all eight met with their Metro Conference counterparts in Dallas in the spring of 1990 to discuss the possibility of creating such a 16-team conference. The Metro Conference never achieved the substantial expansion outlined by the booklet; in 1991, Florida State joined the ACC, South Carolina moved into the SEC, and Boston College, Miami, Pitt, Syracuse, and Virginia Tech began playing football in the Big East. However, Raycom's plan established the blueprint for future superconference creation by emphasizing the importance of using conference expansion to add major markets and increase the conference footprint by expanding into new regions of the country and ultimately securing a significant number of the television households in the United States. According to former Louisville athletic director Bill Olsen, much of the move toward superconferences that has occurred since 2010 is reminiscent of the Metro Conference's plans and ambitions. The Metro itself ultimately dissolved in 1995, when its remnants joined a number of former members of the Great Midwest to form the football-sponsoring Conference USA (C-USA).  Penn State, Notre Dame, and the proposed \\"Eastern Seaboard League\\" (1990)  Also in 1990, the concept of the superconference came into the national spotlight as Penn State joined the Big Ten as its 11th member. That same year, Notre Dame reached its own television deal with NBC instead of continuing its participation in the College Football Association's contract with CBS. Both of these moves greatly concerned schools with independent football programs and resulted in discussions among Eastern independents concerning the creation of a proposed \\"Eastern Seaboard League\\" (ESL). According to a 1990 Sports Illustrated article, the ten schools most likely to join the ESL were Miami, Boston College, Florida State, South Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia Tech, Temple, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Pitt. The ESL was never formed, but the Big East decided to sponsor football starting in 1991 and added Miami, West Virginia, Virginia Tech, Temple, and Rutgers as conference members.  The SEC expands to 12 (1991)  South Carolina, on the other hand, joined the SEC in 1991 along with Arkansas, giving it an unprecedented 12 members and the ability to play a football championship game. Perhaps the first existing superconference, the newly enlarged SEC took advantage of a little-known NCAA rule that allowed a conference of at least 12 teams to form two divisions and play a championship game at the end of the season between the two division winners, with that game not counting against NCAA limits on regular-season contests. The rule had originally been adopted by the NCAA in 1987 to benefit two Division II leagues, the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference and Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (which respectively had 14 and 12 members at the time), but the SEC realized that using the same conference structure for its purposes would allow it to increase its television revenue.  The Big 12 is formed (1996)  The formation of the Big 12 was foreshadowed by a proposed complete merger of the Big Eight with the Southwest Conference (SWC) in 1990, which ultimately failed to materialize largely due to a lack of interest by Texas at the time. In 1996, the Big 12 was created when all eight members of the Big Eight were joined by four members of the SWC (Texas, Texas A&M;, Texas Tech, and Baylor). Following the example of the SEC, the Big 12 established two divisions of six teams and its own football championship game, becoming the second Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conference to do so. According to Blair Kerkhoff of The Kansas City Star, the Big 12 was the first conference to be established primarily for the purpose of securing lucrative media contracts, as it strategically combined the television markets represented by Texas and the Big Eight states (which each accounted for about seven percent of the national market in 1996).  The WAC reaches 16 (1996)  The first major Division I conference to have 16 members was the WAC, which had decided to expand beyond 10 in April 1994. At that time, the SWC was preparing to disband, and the College Football Association, which had loosely controlled TV rights for all Division I-A (now FBS) conferences except the Big Ten and Pac-10, was disintegrating. The WAC publicly announced plans to expand to 12 teams, giving it the right to add a football championship game. However, the WAC's options increased when the collapse of the SWC left four Texas schools searching for a new affiliation. In the end, the WAC added six new schools in 1996, bringing its ranks to 16. The 16-team WAC was immediately beset with internal and external issues. It now stretched from Hawaii to Oklahoma and Eastern Texas, spanning four time zones and nearly . The three new Texas schools‚ÄîRice, SMU, and TCU‚Äîwere all located in large TV markets, but added little value to the WAC because of the dominance of Texas and Texas A&M; in the state's college sports scene. Karl Benson, commissioner of the WAC during this period, recalled in 2011, > There were schools that never bought into the 16 teams. The 10 original WAC > members never had buy-in from all the athletic directors and some of the > high-profile coaches. They were critics, not supporters. The other thing > that kept it hard to manage ‚Äî the presidents never had a natural North-South > or East-West division. There weren't eight teams that naturally fit either > East-West or North-South. As a result, we couldn't come up with permanent > divisions. The WAC tried to manage its unwieldy geography by dividing itself into four \\"pods\\" of four teams each. While this appeared to be viable from the outside, the structure limited the development of conference rivalries because each team's conference games in football (except the three within its pod) would rotate among the other pods. By spring 1998, BYU and Utah wanted to have two set eight-team divisions, which would have forced some teams into an unnatural divisional alignment. New Mexico and UTEP were willing to make such a move, but Air Force and UNLV were bitterly opposed, with Benson recalling in 2011 that Air Force threatened to go independent. Shortly thereafter, the presidents of Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, Utah, and Wyoming met at Denver International Airport and agreed to break from the WAC and form a new league. They invited New Mexico, San Diego State, and UNLV to join them, and this group of eight broke away to form the Mountain West Conference, which began play in the 1999‚Äì2000 school year.  The ACC expands to 12 and the Big East reaches 16 (2005)  In May 2003, the ACC presidents voted in favor of expanding from nine to 12 members, initially engaging Boston College, Miami, and Syracuse in membership talks. In June, the ACC extended formal membership invitations to Miami and Virginia Tech, both of whom accepted and officially joined the conference the next month. Miami and Virginia Tech began play in the ACC in 2004. In October 2003, Boston College was offered and accepted an invitation to become the ACC's 12th member, and once it officially joined the conference in 2005 the ACC was able to split into two divisions and create a football championship game. In response to the loss of three of its members, the Big East added five new members from C-USA, three that played football (Cincinnati, Louisville, and South Florida) and two that did not (DePaul and Marquette). These additions allowed the Big East to expand to 16 total members, although it took the promotion of UConn (traditionally a non-football school) to the ranks of the conference's football members to retain the eight teams needed to preserve its status as an AQ conference. According to Bleacher Report writer Chuck Platt, the 2005 realignment accentuated and exacerbated the already-existing tensions between the \\"football\\" and \\"non-football\\" schools in the Big East, ultimately contributing to the demise of the conference.  Expansion since 2010  Since 2010, speculation about emergent superconferences in American college sports has been rampant and closely connected with conference realignment, with many writers believing that Division I FBS football will eventually be dominated by four or five superconferences consisting of 16 schools each. Speculation consistently includes the Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC as probable eventual superconferences, while both the ACC and Big 12 are sometimes rumored to eventually evolve into superconferences themselves. According to ESPN The Magazine writer Ryan McGee, a superconference is defined by three major attributes: firstly, it is formed from an already-existing BCS Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conference (at the time the article was written in 2011, either the ACC, SEC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, or Pac-12 conference). Secondly, it is in possession of a significant television deal with multiple different networks. And thirdly, it is at least willing to expand to the \\"magic number\\" of 16 member institutions. The following sections detail expansions by AQ conferences that have been contributing to speculation that they are becoming superconferences.  The Big Ten and the Pac-10 expand to 12 (2011)  After the Big Ten's initial announcement that it was looking at expansion in December 2009, rumors about possible expansion targets and the possibility that the conference might expand to as many as 14 or 16 teams circulated into May 2010. On June 11, 2010, Nebraska applied for membership in the Big Ten and was unanimously approved as the conference's 12th school. Its membership became effective July 1, 2011. Big Ten officials later stated that they had no plans to expand beyond 12 teams in the near future. On June 7, 2010, the Pac-10 approved expansion plans and issued invitations to six prospective schools, all from the Big 12: Colorado, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas, Texas A&M;, and Texas Tech. On June 10, 2010, the Pac-10 announced that Colorado would be joining the conference in 2012. For several days, rumors circulated that Texas, Texas A&M;, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State might follow suit and join the Pac-10 as soon as June 15, 2010, although Texas A&M; was also considering a move to the SEC. On June 14, Texas rejected the offer to join the Pac-10, and shortly thereafter Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas A&M;, and Texas Tech pledged to stay in the Big 12 with Texas. On June 17, Utah accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 as its 12th member, and on September 21, Colorado and the Big 12 reached an agreement to allow Colorado to join the Pac-10 a year earlier in 2011. As a result, Colorado and Utah revived a long- dormant rivalry with each other, which has since been dubbed the \\"Rumble in the Rockies\\".  The SEC expands to 14 (2012)  In 2011, the SEC announced the addition of Big 12 members Texas A&M; and Missouri as its 13th and 14th members, both of which officially joined the conference on July 1, 2012. These moves set off the second wave of major conference realignment, as the Big 12 responded by adding TCU (left out of the initial 1996 expansion of the Big Eight Conference into the Big 12) and West Virginia in 2012 to retain a total of ten members. Several other schools have been rumored as potential expansion candidates for the SEC, but the conference has not expanded beyond 14 teams.  The ACC and the Big Ten expand beyond 12 (2013‚Äì2014)  In light of realignment rumors, the ACC voted unanimously to raise its exit fees to $20 million on September 13, 2011. On September 18, Big East members Pitt and Syracuse officially applied to join the ACC and were accepted later that day, giving the conference 14 members. Both schools ultimately negotiated a buyout that enabled them to join the ACC in 2013. On September 12, 2012, the ACC announced that Notre Dame would become the conference's 15th member in all the sports it sponsored except for football, although as part of the agreement the football team will play five games against ACC opponents each season. There remained speculation regarding the timing of the change until March 12, 2013, when it was announced that the Big East would allow Notre Dame to leave for the ACC after the 2012‚Äì13 academic year. At the same time, the ACC also instituted an even larger increase in exit fees, set at three times the conference's annual operating budget (for 2012‚Äì13, the fee would be roughly $50 million). In mid-November 2012, however, the landscape had changed, as ESPN reported that Maryland, a charter member of the ACC, was in \\"serious negotiations\\" to join the Big Ten. Big East member Rutgers was also reported to be in consideration to join the Big Ten at the same time. On November 19, the Maryland regents voted to accept the Big Ten's membership offer, and the Big Ten presidents unanimously approved Maryland's entry later that day. Maryland would officially join in July 2014. Rutgers announced the following day that it would also join the conference in 2014. In response, the ACC voted to accept Louisville as its 14th full member on November 28, 2012, a move that took effect in 2014 when Maryland left the conference. In late May 2013, comments made in December 2012 by Ohio State's then-president Gordon Gee to the university's athletics council were made public. Media attention focused on remarks interpreted as slurs against Catholics and Notre Dame, plus digs at the Southeastern Conference, former Wisconsin football coach Bret Bielema, and the universities of Cincinnati, Kentucky, and Louisville. Gee soon resigned his post. However, his comments also included his thoughts on future conference expansion and realignment, with one remark specifically focusing on the superconference phenomenon: \\"I think we‚Äôre moving precipitously toward about three or four superconferences of about 16 to 20 teams. And the possibility of them bolting from the NCAA is not unlikely.\\"  Gallery   ACC expansion and contraction  File:ACC-USA-states (1).PNG|A map of the ACC as it existed from 2005 to 2013, with Atlantic (blue) and Coastal (tan) divisions File:ACC overview map 2012-13.png|The all-sports ACC as it existed in 2013‚Äì14, after the additions of Syracuse and Pitt for all sports including football, and Notre Dame for non-football sports File:ACC overview map 2012-13a.png|The ACC as it now exists, after the departure of Maryland and addition of Louisville in 2014  Big 12 expansion and contraction  File:Big 12 Divisions Map.png|A map of the Big 12 as it existed from 1996 to 2011, with North (red) and South (grey) divisions File:Big 12-USA- states.PNG|The Big 12 as it existed from 2011 to 2012, after the departures of Colorado and Nebraska File:Big 12 Conference Map.png|The Big 12 as it has existed since 2012, after the departures of Texas A&M; and Missouri and the additions of TCU and West Virginia  Big Ten expansion  File:Big Ten- USA-states.PNG|A map of the Big Ten as it existed between 1990 and 2011 File:BigTenUSAMap 2011.jpg|The Big Ten as it existed between 2011 and 2014, after the addition of Nebraska File:B1Gmap14.png|The Big Ten as it now exists, after the 2014 additions of Maryland and Rutgers  Pac-10 / Pac-12 expansion  File:Pac 10 USA states.svg|A map of the Pac-10 as it existed between 1978 and 2011 File:Pac-12 Conference states.svg|The Pac-12 as it has existed since 2011, after the additions of Colorado and Utah  SEC expansion  File:SEC-USA-states.PNG|A map of the SEC as it existed between 1991 and 2012, with East (blue) and West (yellow) divisions File:SEC-USA- states2011.png|The SEC as it has existed since 2012, after the additions of Texas A&M; and Missouri  References  Category:College athletics conferences ","title":"Superconference"},{"id":"29929035","text":"Thomas Fitzwilliam (died 1497) was Speaker of the House of Commons of England.

It is native to much of northern Africa, the Balkans and western and central Asia. It is a major pest of cereal crops especially wheat, barley and oats. Morphology and biology The colour of the sunn pest varies but it is usually light brown. The body is a broad oval about long. The scutellum is wide and chitinous and covers the wings and the whole abdomen. The insect lives for about a month during which time the females lay twenty eight to forty two eggs. These are laid in batches each having two neat rows of seven eggs, on the underside of leaves and on the stems of the host plant, or sometimes on weeds. The eggs take six to twenty eight days to hatch and the nymphs moult five times while they feed on the leaves, stems and ears of cereal crops for the next twenty to forty five days. They grow fastest at an air temperature of . The second and third instars have a pale abdomen and dark head and thorax. The fourth instar has the rudiments of fore wings and the fifth instar, the rudiments of hind wings as well.AgroAtlas Distribution The sunn pest is found in Northern Africa, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. In Asia it occurs in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan and the republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In Russia it has spread into the central and Volga Basin regions, the Northern Caucasus, the Chelyabinsk region and Bashkortostan. Ecology The adults mostly overwinter in leaf litter in woods but some find refuge among rough vegetation. When the temperature reaches about they seek out cereal crops, start to feed on the stems, leaves and developing seed heads, mate and lay their eggs. There is only one generation each year so adults and nymphs can be found feeding together on the ripening grain. If the insects are not fully developed when the crop is harvested, some nymphs and young adults feed and mature on fallen grain and other crop residues before flying off to their winter quarters. In Syria, they spend about nine months in hibernation.University of Vermont Economic significance Over fifteen million hectares in the affected areas of west and central Asia suffer from infestations with this pest. The number of pests varies enormously from year to year and a significant attack may occur about once in every seven years, potentially causing yield losses worth tens of millions of dollars. The loss in yield of grain has been estimated at 50‚Äì90% in wheat and 20‚Äì30% in barley. While feeding, the sunn bugs inject proteolytic and amylolytic enzymes into the wheat causing breakdown of the gluten which reduces the quality of the flour resulting in the production of inferior dough. Traditional control methods include the early application of fertilizer on winter crops, the early sowing of spring crops, the selection of varieties resistant to the pest and varieties that ripen early and can be harvested early, autumn ploughing in of crop residues and the spraying of crops with pesticides, which should only be done when pest populations rise to economically damaging levels. Integrated pest management Researchers at the Entomology Research Laboratory at the University of Vermont and agricultural researchers working throughout the infested region have been co- operating since 1997 to produce an integrated management plan for the sunn pest. Various on-going research projects are taking place.Research Additionally, an international forum, SunnPestNet, has been set up to improve communication between researchers and agriculturalists from all over the world. Research is being undertaken at the Natural Resources Institute at the University of Greenwich. This project aims to assess the economic thresholds for pest populations, the possible role of egg parasitoids and the possible use of pathogenic fungi to control the pests. Also being investigated is the role of semiochemicals in enabling individual bugs to locate potential mates and suitable host plants, and whether such chemicals could be used as a possible means of control. There is also an initiative to identify resistant strains of cultivated and wild cereals with the objective of developing the germplasm. A study published in 2008 identified several entomopathogenic nematodes that showed promise as biocontrol agents.

In 2018, it was reported that the submarine would be transferred to the Baltic Fleet.https://iz.ru/773751/aleksei-ramm-bogdan-stepovoi/almaz-v- finskom-zalive However, such a transfer had not occurred as of 2020. If the submarine is still active, it is now the only traditional Kilo-class boat (Project 877) remaining with the Black Sea Fleet with all other traditional Kilos in the Fleet having been replaced by the more modern \\"Improved Kilo\\" (Project 636.3) variant. In June 2011 she took part in a NATO submarine rescue exercise, 'Bold Monarch 2011,' the first Russian submarine to do so. Instead of a conventional propeller Alrosa uses a pump jet propulsion system. History The boat was laid down on 17 May 1988 in Gorky under yard number 607. Initially the boat was designed by 877V, included the provision of a water jet nozzle instead of a propeller. On 18 May 1989 boat crew was formed under the command of Captain 3rd Rank A. Yu Romanov. On 10 September 1989 the boat was launched. In November of the same year, B- 871 Alrosa, using inland waterways, crossed the Black Sea and on 1 December 1990, the naval ensign was raised. On 30 December 1990, B-871 became part of the 153rd Brigade of the Red submarines 14th submarine division of Black Sea Fleet based at the South Bay (Sevastopol). From December 1991 - March 1992, the boat fulfilled its tasks of combat service. On 13 March 1992 the boats' crew swore allegiance to Ukraine and captured the boat. Beginning 1992, B-871 was limited to dockside duty due to the lack of batteries. In 1995 the submarine joined the 155th brigade of submarines. On 22 May 1996 after installing batteries, the boat joined the forces of permanent readiness. In August and September of the same year B-871 fulfilled the tasks of combat service with a rating of \\"excellent\\". Returning from deployment, she arrived in Novorossiysk, where she participated in the celebration of Navy Day. In accordance with the Russian-Ukrainian agreement of 1997, the boat became part of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. On 19 September of the same year at the initiative of \\"Alrosa\\" and a number of veterans of the Navy signed an agreement on patronage over the boat stock company \\"Alrosa\\". From August 1998 to April 1999 the vessel was held in Sevastopol for repairs. In January 2004, given the name of the B-871 Alrosa. During August 2008 took part in fights off the Abkhazian coast and landed to Suhumi shore on pier. On 5 August 2009, the submarine conducted deep tests after dock repairs. In the tests, the boat sank to the working depth - up to . On 21 November, while training in the Black Sea there was a failure of the propulsion system. The propulsion system failure may have included an \\"engine fire\\" requiring \\"Alrosa\\" in 2009 having to go to the Kronshtadt port near St. Petersburg for extensive repairs. On 23 November Alrosa was towed to the Novorossiysk naval base. In May -June 2011, Alrosa, together with support vessels, participated in an international exercises for rescue forces, called \\"Bold Monarch\\", held off the coast of Spain. After the exercise, in July, the boat made the transition to the Baltic Sea, where stood for scheduled maintenance in Kronstadt. In September 2012, she returned to Sevastopol after the scheduled maintenance. The transition from the Baltic to the Black Sea took a little more than a month. On 12 May 2013, Alrosa, together with the Ukrainian submarine Zaporizhzhia were present at the celebration of the 230th anniversary of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.

For centuries, they tended flocks of Churra (sheep) in the mountains of the historical region of Le√≥n.http://allaboutaussies.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/the-history-of- australian-shepherds-and-the-spanish-shepherd-dog/ Carea Leon√©s in the Sierras of Castile and Le√≥n History The Carea Leon√©s is a dog whose morphology and character have been molded by its environment, both physical and human. Regarding the physical, it can say that this breed is rooted in the regions of the province of Le√≥n and Zamora. This was so because it are agricultural areas where crops shared its existence with sheep herds. For such coexistence come to fruition, and due to shortage of shepherd men who were at any particular time, and the number of heads could be high, it was necessary to resort to a helper who will control cattle to temptation, and this was the Carea Leon√©s.\\"The environment of the Carea Leon√©s\\". Origin and adaptation carealeones.blogspot Ancestor of other breeds When Spain colonized America, they introduced Churra sheep for food and fiber. They also brought their Carea Leon√©s to manage the huge flocks. These dogs contributed to the type of herding dogs found throughout California and the Southwestern United States including the Australian Shepherd.http://www.lasrocosa.com/aussiehistory1.html Breeds From A Common Root Appearance A Carea Leon√©s with yellow eyes. It is common to see these dogs with blue or yellow eyes. Their coat is smooth and short or moderate length and slightly wavy, and ranges from black to dark liver or merle with white and or tan trim.  Size and weight  They range in size from 18 to 23 inches (45 cm to 58 cm) and in weight from 30 to 70 pounds (14‚Äì32 kg). Temperament This breed is used as a working dog and as a companion. Because of its intelligence, the Carea Leon√©s, like most sheepdogs, is easy to train. Function The function of Carea Leon√©s it is to carry and control livestock, whether sheep, bovine or equine, it is a stubborn and courageous animal with the cattle, not allowing these daunted it. This is an important detail and valued by shepherds, and the dog should be strong with some bite to the respect earned it by the cattle so it can control a large number of sheep and impose to the size of cows or mares, with the possibility of receiving a kick. In mountain areas these are used more for that type of cattle and take to the home the sheep, for the large herds spend most of the year, in the plain, paramos and shores where the carea is very necessary.\\"Carea Leon√©s\\" Tsobu de Laciana It is a very smart and intelligent animal, with great learning ability and willingness to work. It is a dog with good personality but is subject to the orders it receives from its owner.\\"Carea Leon√©s\\" Tsobu de Laciana Activities The Carea Leon√©s can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Careas exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

Opened in 1899, the line ran until 1954 before being closed and scrapped. Construction The County Mental Hospital, also known as St Edward's Hospital, was built in the late 1890s by the Staffordshire County Lunacy Committee to relieve overcrowding in other institutions. The hospital was located on a spur of land overlooking the River Churnet and the Caldon Canal at Cheddleton Heath just north of Cheddleton. Designed by the London architects Giles, Gough and Trollope, construction began in 1895. To assist in construction of the hospital the contractors, W Brown & Son, laid a line from the North Staffordshire Railway's (NSR) Churnet Valley Line at to the hospital site. Brown's used a small 0-4-0 Tank engine called Weaver (Manning Wardle H-class 1072) to transport both men and materials to the construction site. Operation Upon completion of the hospital in 1899, Staffordshire County Council took over the line and converted it to an electrically powered tramway, an overhead wire system was erected and the electricity, operated at 220 volt DC, was supplied from the hospital boiler house. Once electrification work was completed, in 1903, a new platform was constructed at Leek Brook station on the down (towards Leek) Churnet Valley line to allow passengers to alight from NSR trains and cross the platform to use the tramway to visit the hospital. The council purchased an electric locomotive from Wolverhampton and an old London horse tram was converted into a passenger coach; both vehicles were painted with the letters SCC to indicate their ownership by the county council. Although a passenger service was supplied, the principal function of the tramway was the supply of coal to the boiler house. About was required each month, the NSR would deliver loaded wagons of coal to a siding at Leek Brook and the tram engine would propel the wagons, two at a time, to the boiler house with the empty wagons being returned to Leek Brook for collection. After the First World War with the growth in bus and private car transport, there was a decline in passengers using the tramway so passenger services were discontinued in the 1920s. The coal traffic however continued until December 1954 when delivery by road took over and the line was closed and by May 1957 the line had been lifted. Route Map of tramway and connections to the NSR From the platform at Leek Brook, the tramway swung to the right alongside the exchange sidings from the NSR. Railway engines were not allowed further than these sidings under the various agreements between the NSR (and its successor the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and also because being lightly built the tramway could not take the weight of railway locomotives. Past the sidings the line climbed steeply with a maximum gradient of 1:16.6 (6%) being encountered. The line then proceeded by way of a switchback arrangement to terminate at the rear of the main hospital building.

It is situated in the South Caspian Sea, off the coast of Azerbaijan, approximately southeast of Baku, at a depth of . In translation from Azerbaijani, Umid means Hope. History Umid field is a part of a block previously consisting of Umid and Babek fields. The geophysical works at Umid started in 1953 which were repeated in 1972. A total of 9 wells were drilled in the area from 1977 to 1992, however no commercially viable fields were discovered at the time. In 2009, SOCAR financed the exploration works at Umid itself. This is the first time since the Contract of the Century that Azerbaijan conducted exploration works entirely on its own. The discovery of 200 bcm and 30-40 million tons of condensate (around 270-360mn bbl) initially forecasted by Khoshbakht Yusifzadeh was announced by SOCAR on November 24, 2010 after successful drilling at on exploration platform Umid-1. President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan placed enormous hopes on the Umid gas field, remarking in 2010: \\"This field has a great future\\". In 2012 President Aliyev continued pinning great hopes on the competent development of the Umid gas block as part of overall major gas export strategy for Azerbaijan: \\"One of the wonderful events of recent months is that early gas has been produced from ‚ÄúUmid‚Äù field. This is a great indicator. The rate of the gas wells is very high. The first well has very encouraging figures. So ‚ÄúUmid‚Äù lives up to its name. The discovery of ‚ÄúUmid‚Äù by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan is a historic event. The State Oil Company has managed to develop this large gas field on its own for the first time in recent years.\\" The joint venture of SOCAR with Nobel Oil Group drilled three wells in the Umid gas field since 2012. One well failed, while the other two produced decreasing amounts of natural gas: in 2012 ‚Äì 1,500 thousand cubic meters of gas, 2013 ‚Äì 638,000 cubic meters, and in 2014 - 630,000 cubic meters of gas per day. The plan was to drill a total of six wells producing one million to 1.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day. The Nobel Oil Group is a corporate group operating primarily in the USA (Permian Basin), UK, in the Republic of Azerbaijan and in Romania. The Group provides integrated operating services within the oil and gas sector and is also developing its exploration and production capabilities. The group was set up by Azerbaijan-born Mr. Nasib Hasanov, the owner and founder of Nobel Oil Group. As a result of reorganization in 2014, all service segments of the oil and gas industry were united under Nobel Oil Services (UK) Limited, which is a parent company of Global Energy Solutions LLC, Prokon LLC, Absheron Drilling LLC, Llamrei DMCC, etc. The exploration and production business was separated under the name of Nobel Oil E&P; (UK) Limited (Nobel Upstream trademark), which is a parent company of Nobel Oil E&P; Caspian Limited, Nobel Oil E&P; North Sea Limited, Nobel Oil E&P; North America (UK) Limited, and Nobel Oil E&P; North America LLC. In October 2014 SOCAR and Nobel Oil Group decided to stop all drilling due to \\"technical problems in the production process\\", and announced a new international tender for a fresh foreign partner to lead the way and create a new strategy. As of January 2016, the tender has not been materialized. Since March 2015 SOCAR and Nobel Oil Group decided to drill a new appraisal well to get a better estimate of gas reserves in Umid, and hope that this drilling expense will be absorbed by the future foreign partner. According to the wishes of SOCAR and Nobel Oil Group the new foreign partner must have not only the skills and experience of deep-water offshore drilling, but also have available cash reserves. According to expert determinations, the Umid (\\"Hope\\") gas field was too technologically challenging for the two companies developing it, despite spending some US$5 billion already by 2010, and expecting, at the time of high gas prices, about $45 billion in net operating income. Since 2010 expenses have only increased whilst natural gas market prices have fallen. Ownership The gas field currently JV between SOCAR (80%) and Nobel Oil (20%) companies.http://new.socar.az/socar/en/company/joint-ventures/socar-umid-llc The JV's founding capital was just 1,000 AZN. It has been reported that Statoil was negotiating in 2013 to take a major role in developing a cluster of Umid, Babek, Zafar and Mashal fields. Reserves SOCAR leadership estimates that with further drilling, the overall reserves at Umid are likely to reach 300 bcm while those of Babek field lying under Umid will reach 600 bcm. Drilling at Babek will also be done by SOCAR. The Azerbaijan's total gas reserves are estimated at 3 to 5 trillion cubic meters (tcm). The discovery will boost Azerbaijan's potential as gas exporter to Western countries through the European evacuation route, i.e. Trans-Adriatic pipeline or Nabucco West pipeline.

The federal government began to take action against these laws in 1917, when the Supreme Court ruled in Buchanan v. Warley that ordinances prohibiting blacks from occupying or owning buildings in majority-white neighborhoods, and vice versa, were unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 included legislation known as the Fair Housing Act, which made it unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against or prefer a potential tenant based on their race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, when advertising or negotiating the sale or rental of housing. Such protections have also been extended to other \\"protected classes\\" including disabilities and familial status. Despite these efforts, studies have shown that housing discrimination still exists and the resulting segregation has led to wealth and educational disparities.Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane. 2005. \\"The Racial Wealth Gap,\\" in Cecilia A. Conrad, John Whitehead, Patrick Mason, and James Steward (eds.) African Americans in the U.S. Economy. pp. 175- 181, Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc. History After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, Jim Crow laws were introduced. These laws led to the discrimination of racial and ethnic minorities, especially African Americans. Fifteen state courts obeyed ordinances that enforced the denial of housing to African American and other minority groups in white-zoned areas. In the 1917 Supreme Court case Buchanan v. Warley, the court ruled that a Louisville, Kentucky ordinance prohibiting blacks from owning or occupying buildings in a majority-white neighborhood, and vice versa, was unconstitutional. Following this decision, however, nineteen states began legally supporting \\"covenants,\\" or agreements, between property owners to not rent or sell any homes to racial or ethnic minorities. Although the covenants were later made illegal in 1948, they were still allowed to be in private deeds.Silver, Christopher (1997). \\"The Racial Origins of Zoning in American Cities\\". In Thomas, J. M.; Ritzdorf, M.. Urban Planning & the African American Community: In the Shadows. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publ.. . The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was responsible for much of the housing discrimination in the US due to explicit racially discriminatory policies. The FHA believed allowing Black Americans to live in white neighborhood would decrease the property value. This justification, however, was disproven as Black Americans were willing to pay higher prices to live in those neighborhoods. The FHA was also responsible for denying mortgage insurance to Black neighborhoods. The FHA's Underwriting Manual explicitly encouraged \\"prohibition of the occupancy of properties except by the race for which they were intended.\\" Encouraged by the FHA, developers established deed restrictions to maintain white neighborhoods. The GI bill allowed many veterans to become homeowners, leading to a housing boom. However, this bill did not support Black veterans in the same way because mortgages and loans were not provided by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs but by private mortgage lenders who often discriminated through redlining. Levittown was a neighborhood built to provide affordable housing for returning veterans from World War II, but the developer refused to allow people of color to live there. The FHA backed this decision by authorizing loans and providing racially-restricted deeds. It was not until the Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, that the federal government made its first concrete steps to deem all types of housing discrimination unconstitutional.\\"President Signs Civil Rights Bill; Pleads for Calm\\" New York Times, April 12, 1968. The act explicitly prohibits housing discrimination practices common at the time, including filtering information about a home's availability, racial steering, blockbusting, and redlining.Yinger, John. 1998. \\"Closed Doors Opportunities Lost: the continuing cost of housing Discrimination.\\" New York: Russell Sage Foundation Redlining in Milwaukee Fair Housing Act The Fair Housing Act was passed at the urging of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Congress passed the federal Fair Housing Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619, penalties for violation at 42 U.S.C. 3631) Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 only one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The Fair Housing Act introduced meaningful federal enforcement mechanisms. It outlawed: * Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. * Discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin in the terms, conditions or privilege of the sale or rental of a dwelling. * Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin. * Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person's enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights. When the Fair Housing Act was first enacted, it prohibited discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. In 1988, disability and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990). In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is the federal executive department with the statutory authority to administer and enforce the Fair Housing Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated fair housing enforcement and compliance activities to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) and HUD's Office of General Counsel. FHEO is one of the United States' largest federal civil rights agencies. It has a staff of more than 600 people located in 54 offices around the United States. As of June 2014, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez, whose appointment was confirmed on June 19, 2014. Individuals who believe they have experienced housing discrimination can file a complaint with FHEO at no charge. FHEO funds and has working agreements with many state and local governmental agencies where \\"substantially equivalent\\" fair housing laws are in place. Under these agreements, FHEO refers complaints to the state or locality where the alleged incident occurred, and those agencies investigate and process the case instead of FHEO. This is known as FHEO's Fair Housing Assistance Program (or \\"FHAP\\"). There is also a network of private, non-profit fair housing advocacy organizations throughout the country. Some are funded by FHEO's Fair Housing Initiatives Program (or \\"FHIP\\"), and some operate with private donations or grants from other sources. However, victims of housing discrimination need not go through HUD or any other governmental agency to pursue their rights. The Fair Housing Act confers jurisdiction to hear cases on federal district courts. The United States Department of Justice also has jurisdiction to file cases on behalf of the United States where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination or where HUD has found discrimination in a case and either party elects to go to federal court instead of continuing in the HUD administrative process. The Fair Housing Act applies to landlords renting or leasing space in their primary residence only if the residence contains living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more other families living independently of each other, such as an owner-occupied rooming house. Enforcement The Fair Housing Act has been strengthened since its adoption in 1968, but enforcement continues to be a concern among housing advocates. According to a 2010 evaluation of Analysis of Impediments (AI) reports done by the Government Accountability Office, enforcement is particularly inconsistent across local jurisdictions. Subsequent developments The federal government has passed other initiatives in addition to the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 helped with discrimination in mortgage lending and lenders' problems with credit needs.http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/housing_coverage.php Department of Justice The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was passed to give the federal government the power to enforce the original Fair Housing Act to correct past problems with enforcement.Yinger, John. 2001. ‚ÄúHousing Discrimination and Residential Segregation as Causes of Poverty,‚Äù in Sheldon H. Danzinger and Robert H. Haveman, eds. Understanding Poverty. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, pp. 382 ff The amendment established a system of administrative law judges to hear cases brought to them by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and to levy fines. Because of the relationship between housing discrimination cases and private agencies, the federal government passed the two initiatives. The Fair Housing Assistance Program of 1984 was passed to assist public agencies with processing complaints, and the Fair Housing Initiatives program of 1986 supported private and public fair housing agencies in their activities, such as auditing. Between 1990 and 2001, these two programs have resulted in over one thousand housing discrimination lawsuits and over $155 million in financial recovery. However, the lawsuits and financial recoveries generated from fair housing discrimination cases only scratches the surface of all instances of discrimination. Silverman and Patterson concluded that the underfunding and poor implementation of federal, state and local policies designed to address housing discrimination resulted in less than 1% of all instances of discrimination being addressed.Silverman, Robert Mark and Patterson, Kelly L. 2012. \\"The Four Horsemen of the Fair Housing Apocalypse: A Critique of Fair Housing Policy in the USA.\\" Critical Sociology 38(1): 123-140. Moreover, they found that local nonprofits and administrators responsible for enforcing fair housing laws had a tendency to downplay discrimination based on family status and race when designing implementation strategies. Patterson, Kelly L. and Robert Mark Silverman. 2011. \\"How Local Public Administrators, Nonprofit Providers and Elected Officials Perceive Impediments to Fair Housing in the Suburbs: An Analysis of Erie County, New York,\\" Housing Policy Debate 21(1): 165-188. Some states have passed laws on top of the Fair Housing Act that also outlaw housing discrimination based on the source of funding, particularly to combat landlords who openly refuse to serve tenants using Section 8 vouchers. The United States Census has shown that ethnic and racial minorities living in concentrated, high-poverty areas had actually increased following the passage of the Fair Housing Act from 1970 to 1990.https://www.census.gov/ U.S. Census African-Americans residing in these areas rose from 16 percent to 24 percent, and Hispanics living in these areas have increased from 10 percent to 15 percent.Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \\"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\\" in C.Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press While this does not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, it does mirror the phenomenon of white flight‚Äîthe mass exodus during the 1970s and '80s of European-Americans from cities to the suburbs that left only one-fourth of the Anglo population still living in metropolitan areas. American sociologist Douglas Massey, in his essay, \\"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America\\", argues that this new racial geography in the United States has laid the foundation for housing discrimination to occur in order to keep up the status quo. Housing discrimination practices of today Sociologist John Yinger argued that discriminatory housing practices in the housing market have led to segregation, citing examples such as realtors opting to place public housing in crowded inner city minority neighborhoods instead of neighborhoods with an Anglo majority due to \\"public and political pressure.\\" Russell, Marcia C. 2008. Fair Housing. Dearborn: Real Estate Education Company. Other housing phenomena that Yinger argues encourage segregation are those of sorting and bidding, in which bidders perceived to be higher-class win out on cheaper per- square-foot, larger homes farther away from inner cities. Internet classified platforms have also faced scrutiny under the Fair Housing Act; in 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, that Roommates.com had induced housing discrimination by allowing users to specify roommate preferences on their profiles in pre-determined categories relating to protected classes such as gender. This was ruled to not fall under the Section 230 safe harbor‚Äîwhich protects interactive computer services from liability for the actions of their users‚Äîbecause Roommates.com was specifically responsible for having provided specific means to engage in conduct illegal under the Fair Housing Act (however, the site was not deemed responsible for information provided in a field that allowed users to type in additional comments). The Roommates.com decision was overturned in 2012, however, with the court ruling that due to the intimacy of this relationship, it would be a violation of their \\"privacy, autonomy and security\\" if tenants were unable to seek a roommate that was compatible with their own lifestyle. Facebook has faced accusations that its targeted advertising platform facilitates housing discrimination, as it allowed advertisers to target or exclude specific audiences from campaigns, and that its advertising-delivery system is optimized to favor demographics that are the most likely to interact with an ad, even if they are not explicitly specified by the advertiser. After an investigation by ProPublica, Facebook removed the ability for housing advertisers to target ads based on a user's \\"affinity\\" to a specific culture or ethnicity‚Äîa behavior that is calculated based on the user's interactions on the service. However, it was found that advertisers could still discriminate based on interests implicating protected classes (such as Spanish-language television networks), and redlining ZIP code ranges. After signing a legally binding agreement with the State of Washington, Facebook announced that it would remove at least 5,000 categories from its exclusion system to prevent \\"misuse\\", including those relating to races and religions. On March 19, 2019, to settle a lawsuit with the National Fair Housing Alliance, Facebook agreed to create a separate portal for housing, employment, and credit (HEC) advertising with limited targeting options by September 2019, and to provide a public archive of all HEC advertising. Less than two weeks later, HUD filed a lawsuit against Facebook, formally accusing the company of facilitating housing discrimination. LGBT housing discrimination States that prohibit housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. HUD regulations require all housing providers that receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. Housing discrimination focuses more on race, but recent studies have shown a growing trend toward discrimination in the housing market against those who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, or transgender. Since housing discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly cited in the Fair Housing Act, as of 2007, it was banned in only 17 states. In all states, same-sex couples are frequently unable to apply to public housing as a family unit, thus decreasing their chances at being accepted into the program.Cahil, Sean and Sarah Tobias. 2007. Policy Issues Affecting Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Families. Illinois: University of Michigan Press, 2007, For instance, in a comprehensive study done by the Fair Housing Centers of Michigan in 2007, statistics showed that out of 120 paired-tests, almost 30 percent of same-sex couples were given higher rental rates and less encouragement to rent, both examples of non-exclusionary housing discrimination.\\"Fair Housing Commission of Michigan\\". 2008. Accessed December 3, 2010. An HUD study released in 2011 surveyed of 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming persons and found that \\"19 percent reported having been refused a house or an apartment because of gender identity.\\"HUD Addresses LGBT Housing Discrimination October 13, 2011 http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/13/hud-addresses-lgbt-housing- discrimination On January 30, 2012, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan announced new regulations that would require all housing providers that receive HUD funding to prevent housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These regulations went into effect on March 5, 2012. Ethnic and racial minority housing discrimination Ethnic and racial minorities are impacted the most by housing discrimination. Exclusionary discrimination against African Americans most often occurs in rental markets and sales markets. Families are vulnerable to exclusion, but African American women are especially overrepresented as victims, especially single African American mothers. This discriminatory exclusion is because of stereotypes concerning race and single women. The presence of children in a minority family at times is what warrants the discrimination.South, S. J., & Crowder, K. D. (1998). Housing discrimination and residential mobility: Impacts for blacks and whites. Population Research and Policy Review, 17(4), 369-369-387. African Americans are also the victims in most non-exclusionary cases, with African American women still overrepresented. Non-exclusionary forms of discrimination such as racial slurs and intimidation affect many minority victims. Some racial minorities suffer the purposeful neglect of service needs, such as a landlord fixing a white tenant's bathtub quickly but delaying to fix the bathtub of the minority tenant.Roscigno, Vincent J., Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester, 2009 ‚ÄúThe Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination,‚Äù Social Problems, Vol. 56, No. 1. University of California Press. pp.49-69. Data obtained by Ohio Civil Rights Commission studied housing discrimination cases between 1988 and 2003, and of the 2,176 cases filed, 1,741 were filed by African Americans. A study by HUD released in 2005 found that more and more Hispanics are facing discrimination in their housing searches. A 2011 article by HUD asserts that one out of five times, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders receive less favorable treatment than others when they seek housing.HUD Let's Put an End to Housing Discrimination http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/05/12/let-s-put-end-housing-discrimination May 12, 2011 Some cases brought to the Department of Justice show that municipalities and other local government entities violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 when they denied African Americans housing, permits, and zoning changes, or steered them toward neighborhoods with a predominantly minority population. A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) found that, \\"The greatest share of discrimination for Hispanic and African American home seekers can still be attributed to being told units are unavailable when they are available to non-Hispanic whites and being shown and told about less units than a comparable non-minority.\\" Consumer advocate groups conducted studies and found that many minority borrowers who were eligible for affordable, traditional loans were often steered toward incredibly high-priced subprime loans that they would never be able to repay.\\"Fair Lending and Accountability\\" New York Times, September 7, 2011.  Disability discrimination  Studies have shown that there is discrimination against those who use wheelchairs and those who are deaf in the rental housing market. A 2010 HUD study found evidence of housing discrimination agains those with mental disabilities.  Disparate impact  Certain policies that do not explicitly discriminate have also been found to cause housing discrimination in the United States. Disparate impact is a facially neutral housing policy that negatively impacts minorities or other protected groups of people. The Supreme Court upheld the decades long practice of holding housing providers liable for housing discrimination under a disparate impact theory in 2015. Following the Supreme Court decision, HUD issued an opinion from their Office of General Counsel concluding that blanket prohibitions against tenants with criminal convictions would constitute disparate impact housing discrimination because incarceration rates in the United States are disproportionate between minorities and non-minorities. Disparate impact remains controversial among industry and business professionals because some feel that their freedom in implementing policies and rules is now limited . Empirical evidence Quasi-experimental audit studies, in which equally qualified individuals of different races both participate in housing searches, have found strong evidence of racial housing discrimination in the United States. HUD study In a comprehensive study by the HUD in 2000, paired-tests (in which two applicants of different races but the same economic status and credit scores apply to rent or buy a house) were used to determine whether or not statistics about segregation truly pointed to housing discrimination. This study reported that although adverse treatment of racial and ethnic minorities has decreased over time, roughly 25 percent of white applicants were still favored above those who were African- American or Hispanic. About 17 percent of African American applicants and 20 percent of Hispanic applicants were subjected to adverse treatment, including receiving less information about a home or being shown fewer, lower-quality units.Galster, George and Stephen Ross and Margaret Turner and John Yinger, 2002 \\"Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS),\\" Working papers 2002‚Äì16. University of Connecticut: Department of Economics. Effects of housing discrimination John Yinger, a sociologist who has studied housing discrimination, argues that it is something perhaps most concretely evidenced by its effects: concentrated poverty. People who suffer from housing discrimination often live in lower-quality housing. Housing inequalities often reflect the unequal distribution of income. Poor areas suffer from educational disparities, and a poor education translates into earnings disparities. Those who earn less can only afford lower-quality housing. Segregation, health risks, and wealth disparities all relate to poverty. According to a study in the Journal of Economics, homeownership rates for Asian American and Hispanic minorities are negatively impacted by an immigrant status. Thus, their homeownership rates are lower than other demographic groups even when factors like income are accounted for. Residential Segregation Perhaps the most unmistakable consequence of housing discrimination is residential segregation. Housing discrimination helps reinforce residential segregation through mortgage discrimination, redlining, and predatory lending practices. Racial avoidance and threats of violence also result in racial segregation. Housing discrimination can also impact minority preferences over time, as individuals or families experiencing harassment and intimidation at their home on a daily basis may transition to more accepting neighborhoods. According to the U.S. Census of Population in 1990, 25.3 percent of all Anglo-Americans in the U.S. lived in central city areas. The percentage of African Americans living in inner cities was 56.9 percent, and the percentage of inner city Hispanics was 51.5 percent. Asian Americans living in central cities totaled 46.3 percent. According to a more recent U.S. Census Bureau study in 2002, the average white person living in a metropolitan area lives in a neighborhood that is 80 percent white and seven percent black, while the average African American lives in a neighborhood that is 33 percent white and more than 51 percent black. As of 2000, 75 percent of all African Americans lived in highly segregated communities, making them the most segregated group in the nation.Committee on National Statistics. 2002. \\"Measuring Housing Discrimination in a National Study\\". Angela Williams Foster, Faith Mitchell, and Stephen E. Fienberg (eds.) Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. Massey, Douglas S. 2004 These statistics do not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, but rather to segregation based on historical reasons which have made ethnic and racial minorities more economically deprived, and thus prone to living in more poverty-stricken inner city areas. Health Disparities Health risks are a consequence of housing discrimination. Those suffering housing discrimination and people living below the poverty threshold often rent small or low-quality housing. Lead paint left over from past years and animal pests, such as rats, can be found in older housing, resulting in serious health consequences. Lead can lead to lowered intelligence in children.Pearce, JM (2007). \\"Burton's line in lead poisoning\\". European neurology 57 (2): 118‚Äì9. Asthma is also a problem that comes with lower-quality housing, since more air pollution, dust, mold, and mildew are more likely to occur. Housing discrimination has led to climate differences between neighborhoods. A study found that formerly redlined neighborhoods are several degrees hotter than non-redlined neighborhoods. This differences can be explained in differences of development and infrastructure. Poorer, non- white neighborhoods have fewer trees and often are closer to highways and factories. The larger amount of asphalt and cement contributes to the urban heat island effect. The differences in temperature contribute to health disparities and premature heat-related deaths. Neighborhood & Educational Effects Neighborhood effects are also seen due to housing discrimination and residential segregation. The housing inequality that comes with living in lower-quality housing means that neighborhood amenities are lacking.Sen, Amartya K. 2004. \\"From Income Inequality to Economic Inequality,\\" in C. Michael Henry (ed.) Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy, New Haven and London: Yale University Press. Poorer areas offer worse education, leading to educational and employment disadvantages and a higher school dropout rate. Schools are often segregated due to the effects of housing discrimination and residential segregation, in turn hindering students' educational performance. Schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged students, such as schools in segregated areas, have worse educational outcomes that are compounded by other disparities, such as differences in parental education, local crime, access to healthcare, and extracurricular opportunities. These differences and their impacts are known as the achievement gap. A study conducted by the Century Foundation in Montgomery County, Md., showed that students from a low-income background enrolled in affluent schools did better than students in higher- poverty schools. Criminal activity, including gang life and drug abuse, is also more prevalent in poorer areas. The rate of teenage pregnancy has been shown to increase in these areas as well.Seitles, Marc, 1996 ‚ÄúThe Perpetuation of Racial Residential Segregation in America: Historical Discrimination, Modern Forms of Exclusion, and Inclusionary Remedies,‚Äù Florida State University College of Law. Wealth Disparities In the US, white households have a median wealth of $134,230, while Black households have a median wealth of $11,030, demonstrating significant wealth disparities. Sociologists Thomas Shapiro and Jessica Kenty-Drane, as well as Richard Rothstein, state that wealth disparities are a result of housing discrimination, as housing discrimination acts as a barrier to homeownership. Homeowners may learn management and home repair skills, and the children of homeowners are less likely to drop out of high school or to have children as teenagers. Additionally, credit constraints limit homeownership for people with low income. Housing discrimination that keeps families from affordable loans and nicer areas with increasing property values keep victims from accumulating wealth. Residential segregation also leads to generational wealth disparities. Children often inherit wealth from their parents, and if parents were forced into poor-quality housing because of housing discrimination, then there is less wealth to hand down. Possible solutions Sociologist Douglas Massey argues that housing discrimination is a moving target. As federal legislation concerning anti-housing discrimination policies become more effective, new forms of housing discrimination have emerged to perpetuate residential segregation, and in turn, poverty. There have been a number of solutions proposed to finally end the threat of housing discrimination and eliminate any legal loopholes in which it may operate. So far fair housing enforcement of federal legislation concerning housing discrimination has faced challenges. The main burden of enforcement falls on federal financial regulatory institutions, like the Federal Reserve Board, and the HUD. The enforcement provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 were limited, and even though the act was amended in 1988, there are still problems with enforcement since housing discrimination often happens one-on-one and is not very visible, even in audits. The Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 did make a system of administrative law judges to hear housing discrimination cases to help against the illegal actions. Other examples of federal legislation may include increased federal legislation enforcement, scattered-site housing, or state and local enforcement on a more concentrated level. Better methods of enforcement in addition to new policies are proposed to be a help. In 2010 the Justice Department under President Barack Obama made a new fair-lending unit. Inclusionary remedies to truly enforce integration are also proposed. Inclusionary housing refers to making sure that areas are integrated, and inclusionary housing increases chances for racial minorities to gain and sustain employment. Recently Montgomery County, Md., passed an ordinance to require new housing developments to consist of a percentage of moderately priced dwelling units, guaranteeing more affordable better housing for 10 years.Florence W. Roisman & Hilary Botein, Housing Mobility and Life Opportunities, 27 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 335, 348 (1993) Other proposed solutions include subsidies, such as direct subsidies, project-based subsidies, household-based subsidies, and tax reductions. As of 2001, only 15.7 percent of poor households received federal housing subsidies, meaning a majority of people in poor households did not receive that help. Household-based subsidies have been a significant source of new housing assistance as of late. HUD has handed out housing certificates to allow participants of Section 8 to move into higher-quality housing units. It is important to prioritize policy and city planning. Planning for sustainability does not come with a one-size fits all approach; wicked problems persist without clarity or solutions. However, looking beyond urban regimes and accepting the nexus of these regimes is the first step for change that planners can take. This can be done through the notion of Equitable Development, an approach that aims to create communities of opportunity. Inequalities oppressing low-income communities composed of diverse ethnicities are not only unethical but prove to be economically and environmentally unsustainable. Partnership between government, private sectors, and community-based organizations to manipulate public policy for the promotion of social equity, as well as, economic growth and environmental sustainability are crucial for justice.Blackwell, Angela Glover. \\"Promoting Equitable Development.\\" (n.d.): n. pag.

It was originally developed by Lindgren and Nilsson. The typical reaction conditions used today were developed by G. A. Kraus. H.W. Pinnick later demonstrated that these conditions could be applied to oxidize Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehydes. There exist many different reactions to oxidize aldehydes, but only a few are amenable to a broad range of functional groups. The Pinnick oxidation has proven to be both tolerant of sensitive functionalities and capable of reacting with sterically hindered groups. This reaction is especially useful for oxidizing Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehydes, and another one of its advantages is its relatively low cost. :PinnickOxidationReaction Mechanism The proposed reaction mechanism involves chlorous acid as the active oxidant, which is formed under acidic conditions from chlorite. :ClO2‚àí \\\\+ H2PO4‚àí HClO2 \\\\+ HPO42‚àí First, the chlorous acid adds to the aldehyde. Then resulting structure undergoes a pericyclic fragmentation in which the aldehyde hydrogen is transferred to an oxygen on the chlorine, with the chlorine group released as hypochlorous acid (HOCl). :700px Side reactions and scavengers The HOCl byproduct, itself a reactive oxidizing agent, can be a problem in several ways. It can destroy the NaClO2 reactant: :HOCl + 2ClO2‚àí ‚Üí 2ClO2 \\\\+ Cl‚àí \\\\+ OH‚àí making it unavailable for the desired reaction. It can also cause other undesired side reactions with the organic materials. For example, HOCl can react with double bonds in the organic reactant or product via a halohydrin formation reaction. To prevent interference from HOCl, a scavenger is usually added to the reaction to consume the HOCl as it is formed. For example, one can take advantage of the propensity of HOCl to undergo this addition reaction by adding a sacrificial alkene-containing chemical to the reaction mixture. This alternate substrate reacts with the HOCl, preventing the HOCl from undergoing reactions that interfere with the Pinnick reaction itself. 2-Methyl-2-butene is often used in this context: :300px Resorcinol and sulfamic acid are also common scavenger reagents. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be used as HOCl scavenger whose byproducts do not interfere in the Pinnick oxidation reaction: :HOCl + H2O2 ‚Üí HCl + O2 \\\\+ H2O In a weakly acidic condition, fairly concentrated (35%) H2O2 solution undergoes a rapid oxidative reaction with no competitive reduction reaction of HClO2 to form HOCl. :HClO2 \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí HOCl + O2 \\\\+ H2O Chlorine dioxide reacts rapidly with H2O2 to form chlorous acid. :2ClO2 \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí 2HClO2 \\\\+ O2 Also the formation of oxygen gives good indication of the progress of the reaction. DMSO has been used instead of H2O2 to oxidize reactions that do not produce great yields using only H2O2. Mostly electron rich aldehydes fall under this category. (See Limitation below) Also, solid- supported reagents such as phosphate-buffered silica gel supported by potassium permanganate and polymer-supported chlorite have been prepared and used to convert aldehydes to carboxylic acid without having to do conventional work-up procedures. The reaction involves the product to be trapped on silica gel as their potassium salts. Therefore, this procedure facilitates easy removal of neutral impurities by washing with organic solvents. Scope and limitations The reaction is highly suited for substrates with many group functionalities. Œ≤-aryl-substituted Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehydes works well with the reaction conditions. Triple bonds directly linked to aldehyde groups or in conjugation with other double bonds can also be subjected to the reaction. Hydroxides, epoxides, benzyl ethers, halides including iodides and even stannanes are quite stable in the reaction. The examples of the reactions shown below also show that the stereocenters of the Œ± carbons remain intact while double bonds, especially trisubsituted double bonds do not undergo E/Z‚Äìisomerization in the reaction. :Scope Lower yields are obtained for reactions involving aliphatic Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated and more hydrophilic aldehydes. Double bonds and electron-rich aldehyde substrates can lead to chlorination as an alternate reaction. The use of DMSO in these cases gives better yield. Unprotected aromatic amines and pyrroles are not well suited for the reactions either. In particular, chiral Œ±-aminoaldehydes do not react well due to epimerization and because amino groups can be easily transformed to their corresponding N-oxides. Standard protective group approaches, such as the use of t-BOC, are a viable solution to these problems. Thioethers are also highly susceptible to oxidation. For example, Pinnick oxidation of thioanisaldehyde gives a high yield of carboxylic acid products, but with concomitant conversion of the thioether to the sulfoxide or sulfone. :500px See also * Lindgren oxidation References Category:Name reactions Category:Organic oxidation reactions ","title":"Pinnick oxidation"},{"id":"29930153","text":"John Greenhalgh (died 1651), was the governor of the Isle of Man.

It is in memory of British Royal Navy officer Chandos Scudamore Scudamore Stanhope, who performed several life-saving events during his lifetime. Background The \\"Stanhope Medal\\" is named after British Royal Navy officer Chandos Scudamore Scudamore Stanhope (1823‚Äì1871). He served as a naval officer mate from November 1842 after he passed his officer's exam. He was promoted to lieutenant in March 1846. Stanhope was also a personal assistant to First Lord of the Admiralty Hugh Childers. He served on , a 50-gun ship with captains Sir John Hay and Sir Provo William Parry Wallis. He was appointed in December 1846 to , a 110-gun ship of Sir John West at Devonport. Stanhope later served from August 1847 in the Pacific on , an 84-gun ship commanded by Rear-Admiral Phipps Hornby. Stanhope became a captain in August 1858. He commanded from Rio de Janeiro to Singapore in 1867. Stanhope received a Royal Humane Society Silver Medal in 1851 for the rescue of a drowning seaman. He died from smallpox in 1871 when he was 48 years old. Soon after his death a group of his friends formed a memorial in his honour and raised four hundred poundsa large sum at the timefor the issuance of a yearly gold medal honoring a courageous rescue. They gave the money to the Royal Humane Society on the terms that any interest the money earned would be for a periodic gold medal to be given for the greatest gallantry of a hero of the previous year. It is called the \\"Stanhope Medal.\\" Description The Royal Humane Society issues the Stanhope Medal as the highest of several heroism awards. The award is presented annually for the most gallant rescue of the previous twelve months. The first gold medal awarded went to Matthew Webb in an attempt to rescue a man drowning in the Atlantic Ocean in 1873. The medal is inscribed with Lateat Scintillvia Forsan, the motto of the Royal Humane Society, which means ‚Äúa small spark may perhaps lie hid.‚Äù Beginning in 1962 several societies began nominating rescues for the award, including the Liverpool Shipwreck and Humane Society and the Humane Societies in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In five years1959, 1960, 1961, 1969, and 1973no medal has been awarded as no significant rescue was deemed sufficiently worthy during the previous 12 months. The medal issued in the twenty-first century is identical to the Royal Humane Society's bronze and silver awards. The Stanhope Medal has been in 18-carat gold and suspended from a plaque-shaped bar inscribed with date of award and the words STANHOPE MEDAL. It became 9-carat gold in 1942.  Police officer award  The Royal Humane Society Police Medal is awarded each year to a United Kingdom police officer whose lifesaving act is judged more notable than others.

Considered a unique example for the evolution of architecture during the nineteenth century in the city, the lighthouse was designed by Fran√ßois Coignet at the request of the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, Ismail the Magnificent. Construction was completed in 1869, one week prior to the inauguration of the Suez Canal. The lighthouse was built to guide ships passing through the canal. The lighthouse has an octagonal shaped tower that is 56 m high. History The lighthouse of Port Said in the 1930s From 1868 until the end of his reign, Khedive Ismail ordered the construction of lighthouses at different points across Egypt's Mediterranean coast. Among these, the lighthouse of Port Said had special significance owing to its connection to the Suez Canal, the national infrastructure project undertaken during Ismail's reign. Ismail commissioned French architect Fran√ßois Coignet to design the lighthouse, and oversee its construction. Coignet used the novel technique of building the lighthouse out of reinforced concrete. The lack of nearby stone quarries and the cost of importing stone from elsewhere caused those in charge of construction to become interested in the use of concrete. At the time, the lighthouse was a paragon of modernism worthy of an international reputation. The lighthouse was constructed by layering liquid 20 ‚Äì 25 cm in thickness. To ensure the structural cohesion of the whole, iron wall ties were inserted. The use of concrete was doubly innovative: employed as a distinct material, not merely a substance for filling, and strengthened with metal rods. Quite simply, reinforced concrete had been invented.Port-Sa√Ød : Architectures XIXe-XXe si√®cles Broch√© ‚Äì 21 avril 2011 The use of electric light (powering an arc lamp) made it possible to display a consistent flashing light and it was a state of the art lighthouse at the time. Nothing of the original Port Said remains except for the lighthouse, which has been pushed to the interior of the city by the gradual silting of the port, and, therefore, no longer of use for its original purposes of guiding ships. In 2010, intellectuals called for it to be turned into a museum of maritime transport. In January 2011, the Port Said lighthouse was officially registered as a national monument in Egypt.

Life and career Nielsen was born in Stubbek√∏bing on the island Falster in the southeast of Denmark. In 1887 his father, a coach builder, smashed his knee in a working accident and went bankrupt with his workshop. When the father died in 1893, the family was left in poverty. In 1893 Evald Nielsen was apprenticed to the workshop of Aug. Fleron in Copenhagen, first as a press operator, later as steel engraver. In 1900, when he had finished his training, he travelled and worked in Germany, Switzerland and France, and he visited the World Exhibition in Paris 1900. In 1905 Evald Nielsen opened his own shop and workshop in a cellar in Raadhusstr√¶de, Copenhagen. At first he worked as silversmith as well as engraver, but after a few years he concentrated on silver producing and selling hollow ware, jewelry and first of all cutlery. In 1914 his workshop employed 14 persons. In 1918 his shop and workshop moved to Vester Voldgade 11 in Copenhagen, where the firm had its base for the following decade. In 1926 Evald Nielsen bought a property at Nygade}} 5 - a street which is part of the main shopping area in Copenhagen, and moved his shop to this building. In 1931 the shop was renovated and rebuild in the art deco style, attracting much attention among the Copenhageners of that time. In 1930 the workshop was moved from Vester Voldgade to rented premises in Ny Vestergade 7 some hundred meters east of Nygade. From 1927 and a decade onwards Evald Nielsen's oldest son, the silversmith Aage Weimar (1902‚Äì1986) worked in the firm, until he opened his own workshop. Evald Nielsen's other son, Bjarne Weimar (1906‚Äì1988), finished his education as a chaser in 1929 and started working in his father's firm. In 1941 he was taken into partnership, and he tried to carry on with the firm, when Evald Nielsen died in 1958. His attempt wasn't successful, and the shop in Nygade closed in the spring of 1970. The workshop in Ny Vestergade was in 1958 let on lease to Ejnar Olsen, who produced to the shop in Nygade. In 1967 the workshop was sold to Helge Hansen. The following year he moved the activities to R√∏dovre (a suburb west of Copenhagen), where he already had a workshop. Up to 2006 the firm was carried on in the name of Evald Nielsens Eftf. (Evald Nielsen's successor), the last years with Helge Hansen's sons Harly Hansen and S√∏ren Pedersen as owners. In 2006 they sold the firm and the rights to the Evald Nielsen-name and -design to silversmith Gregers Holt; today he is running Evald Nielsens Eftf. from premises in Stenl√∏se northwest of Copenhagen. Design Silversmith Evald Nielsen - anno 1924 No 4 Silversmith Evald Nielsen - anno 1924 No 4 Evald Nielsen opened his workshop the year after the well known Georg Jensen started as silversmith. In the years to come Evald Nielsen put his mark on the Danish sk√∏nvirke-style (jugend). Contrary to Georg Jensen Evald Nielsen based his firm on his own design and only to a small extent used artists and architects as designers. During the first decades he himself designed jewellery, hollow ware and cutlery. He generated his own style, among other things characterized by the so-called drawn out or stretched mountings holding the stones of the jewellery. In the 1930s his son Aage Weimar was attached to the firm, he worked with design, and he took part in bringing Evald Nielsen into the art deco style with its tighter use of form. Evald Nielsen sold his silver not only in Denmark; he had many customers in Germany, and from the 1930s and forward Americans were frequent customers. Today his works are highly appreciated by collectors in the two countries. Throughout his whole life Evald Nielsen was characterized by his wholehearted holding on to skilful craftsmanship and excellent quality. To him the fully trained craftsman was the one and only to design and create. \\"The professional skill and knowledge of the trade has always been essential in preserving the confidence between the goldsmith and the costumers,\\" he in January 1935 wrote in Guldsmede-Bladet (trade paper for the Danish gold- and silversmiths). Because of that he worked hard to organize the training of the employees at the workshops, and among other things he in 1918 took part in planning and teaching at the first courses for gold- and silversmiths at the Danish Technological Institute. Organizing work In 1913 Evald Nielsen became a member of the Goldsmith's Guild of Copenhagen. In 1918 he was elected master of the guild. From then on he engaged himself in organizing work, building up an organization that could represent the Danish gold- and silversmiths in negotiations with the rapidly growing labor unions that defended the rights of the employees. The most important step was the formation of Dansk Guldsmedemesterforening (the Union of Danish Goldsmithmasters) in 1920 with Evald Nielsen as the first chairman. From here he was engaged in a number of organizations, and among other things he for many years was a member of the executive committee of The Confederation of Danish Employers. During the 1940s Evald Nielsen cut down on the organizing work. He resigned the chairmanship of Dansk Guldsmedemesterforening in 1946, shortly after his silver jubilee. In 1948 - after 30 years - he retired from the mastership of the Goldsmith's Guild of Copenhagen and was at that occasion made honorary master. Through his contribution Evald Nielsen to a high degree formed the basis of the organization of the Danish gold- and silversmiths that is prevailing today.

There in 1531 he appointed regent Nicolas Cop.Agn√®s Pellerin, Les Portugais √† Paris: au fil des si√®cles & des arrondissements, Editions Chandeigne, 2009, , in French After Cop's contested inaugural address as rector of the university in 1533, he was appointed rector of the University of Paris for the college of arts (liberal arts), introducing new rules for transparency and fairness among all disciplines, but soon departed. He left to take charge as principal of the College of Guienne, in Bordeaux. He had been invited by the municipal authorities, and was given full freedom to modernize the old college. On arrival, Gouveia proclaimed that he would not recognize differences of creed in staff and pupils, many of whom showed sympathy to the new doctrines of the Reform. There, in 1539, Gouveia welcomed George Buchanan, appointing him professor of Latin. Gouveia's stay at the College of Guienne lasted until 1547, attracting students like √âtienne de La Bo√©tie and Michel de Montaigne, who later in his Essays described Gouveia as \\" ...behind comparison the greatest principal in France.\\" The fame of the teaching -mainly grammar, classical literature, history and philosophy - was such that, in 1552, Italian scholar and physician Julius Caesar Scaliger sent his sons to the college, including Joseph Justus Scaliger. Andr√© de Gouveia returned to Portugal at the invitation of King John III, accompanied by a group of foreign teachers, to head the new College of the Arts at the University of Coimbra. In this group were Diogo de Teive, George Buchanan, Jer√≥nimo Os√≥rio, Nicolas de Grouchy, Guillaume Gu√©rante and √âlie Vinet, who came to be decisive for the disclosure of contemporary research of Pedro Nunes. However, Gouveia did not remained for long in office as president of the college, as he died in June 1548. Rivalry between the secular trends of the new \\"Bordeaux\\" teachers, and the more orthodox method of the \\"Parisian\\" school headeds by Diogo de Gouveia led to several teachers, including George Buchanan, to face the Inquisition: Gouveia kept numerous contacts with European scholars and Portuguese businesses when he was in France. At odds with his uncle Diogo, Andr√© was suspected of Lutheranism. He left a few written texts, in particular his views are represented regulations of the College of Guienne, published by Elie Vinet in 1583 under the title Schola Aquitanica. Andr√© de Gouveia was brother to humanist and teacher Ant√≥nio de Gouveia.

The club took its name from the Lanemark Coal Company which was formed in 1865 to work coal in the vicinity of Lanemark Farm in New Cumnock. As the coal industry grew so did the demand for workers, so the coal company built small basic houses in terraces known as ‚Äúrows‚Äù in the South Boag area of the town. The original Lanemark F.C. was founded in 1877 and played their home games at Connel Park, South Boag, which was opposite Knockshinnoch Pit. As a senior Scottish club they were entitled to enter the Scottish Cup although their record was poor, and when the club folded in 1882, they had never progressed beyond the first round. A second Lanemark F.C. was formed three years later in 1885, and again played their home games at Connel Park. The club strip was blue shirts with either navy blue or white shorts.http://www.scottish-football-historical-archive.com In 1892 Lanemark joined the new South of Scotland Football League but the League collapsed in disarray, in no small measure due to the inability or unwillingness of Lanemark to arrange League fixtures. A 1‚Äì9 defeat in their first game may explain this reluctance. The next season the club returned to their normal diet of friendlies and local Cup competitions, of which there were many. Their one season of note in the Scottish Cup came in the 1888‚Äì89 season when Lanemark reached the fourth round before losing 0‚Äì8 at Connel Park to a powerful Renton side.http://www.statto.com/football/teams/lanemark/1888-1889/results. The early years of the twentieth century saw Lanemark competing in the North Ayrshire Football League, then the Ayrshire and Renfrewshire Football League and finally the Scottish Combination. After the Ayrshire Cup was won in 1907, the club began to struggle financially and in 1920 the club was formally dissolved.http://www.scottish-football-historical-archive.com A new junior club, New Cumnock United, was formed later that same year, also based at Connel Park, but disbanded in 1928.

The seated design ensures that users are kept in the correct position to stretch muscle groups. Overview The machine is designed to incorporate stretching into the exercises; it takes about ten minutes to complete a workout. Stretching is beneficial when warming up or cooling down from a workout; not only does stretching muscles help prevent injury during exercise, but increased flexibility is one of the health-related components of physical fitness. The StretchTrainer has been engineered to be lightweight with a small footprint so that it fits into a home gym or fitness center. The seated design helps stabilize the back during stretching movements. Mechanics The StretchTrainer works by using the exerciser's own weight to stretch the major muscle groups. The user sits on the cushioned seat with their knees placed on the kneepad and hold the padded handlebars in front. The design ensures the correct stretching position to keep the spine aligned and prevent any straining. The machine is constructed of steel frame that can support users up to 250 pounds and accommodate exercisers of any height. The tilting seat leans back and forth on a self-lubricated pivot point. As a safety feature, the StretchTrainer has two polyester wrists straps attached to the handlebars so that when used properly, if the user loses grip, they will not fall back out of the seat and onto the floor. Usage StretchTrainer placard The StretchTrainer comes with an attached placard with instructions and graphics showing the user the eight essential stretches to target key muscle groups: * Lower back * Hamstrings * Gluteal/hips * Hips/legs/back * Inner thighs/Groin * Upper back * Shoulders * Quadriceps By placing the legs in the indicated position, gripping the handlebars as shown, and tilting slowly backwards, the user will be able to stretch each of the muscle groups. Physical benefits Stretching is an exercise that leads to increased muscle control, flexibility, range of motion, circulation, and overall fitness level. An active stretching regimen can strengthen muscles because stretching affects muscles in a way similar to strength training, just on a smaller scale. A stretching regimen has been shown to increase weight-lifting abilities, improve endurance, and assist in plyometrics. Research shows that StretchTrainer users can increase their flexibility (as judged by a basic sit and reach test) after 30 days of use, regardless of age. The design of the StretchTrainer makes sure that the body and joints are kept in line, and because the machine's tension is actually the user's own weight, it is virtually impossible to hyperextend any muscles.

The species is widespread in temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere. P. porrigens, known as the angel wing, is a white-rot wood-decay fungus on conifer wood, particularly hemlock (genus Tsuga). The flesh is thin and fragile compared to the oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ssp.). Pleurocybella porrigens has historically been generally regarded as edible but this has been brought into question by recent deaths apparently associated with P. porrigens consumption. Synonyms for Pleurocybella porrigens include Pleurotus porrigens, Phyllotus porrigens, Dendrosarcus porrigens, Pleurotellus porrigens, and Nothopanus porrigens.  Description  The mushroom species is distinguished by its fruit bodies, which begin as a pure white and then form a tinge of yellow over time. The stipe is either very short or completely absent, and the flesh has a faint but pleasant smell. Toxicity Angel wing growing on a decaying log in Dundreggan, Scotland. Although P. porrigens is generally regarded as edible, as of 2011, it has been implicated in two documented outbreaks involving fatal encephalopathy. Both incidents were in Japan, and most victims had pre-existing kidney disorders. The first incident occurred in September and October 2004 across nine prefectures in Japan, and involved the sickening of 59 people and the eventual death of 17. Most of those who died had pre-existing liver problems, and the average age of those affected was 70. Death occurred between 13 and 29 days after the onset of symptoms, and the onset of symptoms occurred at most three weeks after consumption of P. porrigens. The second incident occurred in 2009, when a 65-year-old man who had been on hemodialysis died from acute encephalopathy after eating P. porrigens. The mechanism of action for the toxicity of P. porrigens has not been definitively established, but several possibilities have been suggested. It has been demonstrated that P. porrigens contains an unusual unstable amino acid which is toxic to the brain cells of rats in cell culture studies, but it has not yet been possible to definitively determine that this was the cause of the fatal encephalopathies. Other mechanisms have been suggested for P. porrigens's apparent toxicity, including the possibility that the fungus may contain toxic levels of cyanide salts.

His career as an architect spans the change in styles in Finland from the Nordic Classicism of the 1920s to the Modernism of the 1970s. Career Ekeleund studied architecture at Helsinki University of Technology, qualifying as an architect in 1916. His wide career in architecture spanned from the design of public housing areas and town planning to public buildings, factories and churches. Following a classical education in architecture, where the predominant style was Nordic Classicism, Ekelund like others Finnish architects of his generation, such as Alvar Aalto, made the switch to Modernism ‚Äì known in Finland as \\"Functionalism\\" ‚Äì partly in response to the greater urbanisation of the country during the 1920s and 1930s.Museum of Finnish Architecture web site Ekelund designed a significant number of buildings in the town of Karis, already during the 1930s. The town plan for the town, drawn up in the 1930s by architect Carolus Lindberg was soon regarded as over-dimensioned, and Ekelund was given the task of redesigning it. His \\"modern\\" design was influenced by ideas from the Garden city movement, as interpreted in Finland by Otto-Iivari Meurman and its modern interpretation by Le Corbusier, with a particular emphasis on open spaces and parks. In the town Ekelund designed a dispensing chemist, the town hall, cemetery chapel, water tower, trade college and several schools and old-people's homes. Architectural competitions have been a common method in Finland for choosing designs for key public buildings, and Ekelund entered several of them over the length of his career. For instance, he won the competition for the choice of the site of the Finnish Parliament building - though the final site was later changed and the final architect of the building, following a second competition, was chosen as J.S. Sir√©n. Among Ekelund's more notable buildings are the Taidehalli Art Gallery (together with Jarl Eklund) in Helsinki, T√∂√∂l√∂ Church in Helsinki, the Finnish Embassy in Moscow, and a number of buildings for the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki, including the Olympic Rowing Stadium, the Olympic Velodrome, and the Olympic Games village.Docomomo Suomi Finland Hilding Ekelund's brother was the author and painter Ragnar Ekelund.

The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History In the autumn of 1850 the first meeting was held to organize a Christian School and a place for worship by the first Norwegian immigrant settlers to the Paint Creek area of Allamakee County. The school was organized in March the following year with Ole Larson as the first teacher. The first church services were held in July in the home of Thomas Anderson by Pastor Claus Lauritz Clausen from Rock County, Wisconsin. The schoolhouse was completed by November 1851 and was used for church services as well. Initially, the congregation had only visiting ministers. They sent a Letter of Call to Norway for their own pastor. It was answered by the Rev. U. V. Koren who arrived in late 1853 and stayed until 1862 when he returned to Norway. All of East Paint Creek's early pastors were from Norway. with In July 1855 it was decided to build log structure for a church and it was completed in 1857. The congregation grew in size and divided into two separate churches, East Paint Creek Church and West Paint Creek Church, because of the poor roads in the area. The cornerstone for the present church was laid on May 24, 1869, and the church was dedicated on August 24, 1870. W.A. Eriksen constructed the Gothic Revival style building. The Rev. Ove Jacob Hjort (1827-1879) was the pastor at the time. A cemetery, which pre-dates it, surrounds the church building. Services were conducted in Norwegian, at least partially, into the 1930s. In 1880 a controversy over predestination erupted among Norwegian Lutherans which affected the congregations in the Paint Creek area. A small group broke away from the original churches and became known as the East and West Synod Lutheran Churches. To distinguish between the two groups, the original churches they were renamed Old East Paint Creek Church and Old West Paint Creek Church. Old East Paint remained in the \\"anti- Missouri\\" synod of the church until 1890 when they affiliated with the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America. Another split in the congregation occurred in 1907 that resulted in the establishment of the Waterville Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 1917 Old East Paint Church changed their affiliation to the Evangelical Lutheran Church. They are now affiliated with the North American Lutheran Church. Architecture The main church follows a rectangular plan, measuring . The exterior is composed of locally quarried limestone covered with stucco. The projecting central pavilion is capped with a frame bell chamber and spire that rises to a height of . The main entrance, also located in the central pavilion, is located within an elliptical arch that is framed by a Gothic portico. The side elevations feature five lancet windows that are symmetrically placed. A vestry was added later to the rear of the church sanctuary. Its exterior is also composed of limestone that is laid in random coursed ashlar without a stucco covering. It may indicate the appearance of the main church without the stucco. A new basement and foundation were built beneath the church and vestry from 1949 to 1952. Matching additions with shed roofs were built on each side of the vestry in 1967. The interior features its original wooden altar, pulpit, baptismal font, pews, altar rail, and a two-tier brass chandelier. The stained glass windows date from 1957. The original balcony stairs were replaced in 1970. The sanctuary interior is capped with a pressed tin ceiling.

As the traffic between these kinds of chassis is comparable with the data that flows over a backplane in a single-shelf system the required bandwidth is very high and as is the need for reliability the shelves are interconnected using several fibre optic cables. As this protocol/feature is only used in multi- shelf Cisco-CRS systems you will only find it in IOS XR the special high performance version of Cisco IOS. There are basically two types of multi-shelf CRS systems:Cisco CSR-1 Introduction to Multishelf System Cabling, visited 6 December 2010 * single switch-fabric chassis and two line-card chassis * two switch-fabric chassis and two line-card chassis * four switch-fabric chassis and two line-card chassis The second option allows for the most fault-tolerant system in a CRS system: although a single shelf switch-fabric allows for redundancy on most levels (power. fans, management-cards, switch-cards etc.), a multi-shelf system based on two switch-fabric cards and (at least) two line- card chassis will continue to run even when one of the switch-fabric shelves is completely down. The four SCC/2 LCC also gives optimal availability and reliability without the loss of any throughput in case that a switch fabric module fails. Distance between shelves Although the different shelves of a multi-shelf routing system will often be placed directly next to each other the PAROLI system allows for some distance between the shelves. If you want to place the different shelves in different rooms (e.g. in a system with two switch-fabris chassis have one of these chassis with 50% of the line-card chassis in dataroom 1 and the rest of the system in room 2 so that even when there is fire in one room the system will continue to work) it is possible as long as the length of the fibre-optic cables doesn't exceed 100 meters (328 feet). This will also allow you to move individual shelves of the system Interconnecting shelves All traffic coming in into a multi-shelf CRS system will come in via an interface of a line card on a line-card shelf. The traffic is then sent to the switch-fabric shelf where the packet is processed and based on the destination (and of course system-configuration) the data is then sent to the outgoing interface on a line-card in a line-card shelf. The inter shelf communication links will therefore process the same kind of data- volumes as a backplane will normally carry in any single-shelf router. To allow these speeds via external fibre optic cabling Cisco designed special modules to make this possible. For a multi-shelf system you need three kind of connections between the line-card chassis and the switch-fabric chassis: *1:Management cabling *2:Controller cabling *3:Fabric cabling Management cabling The management, alarm and external clock cabling is to allow management of the different shelves in the system. There are different type of management and clock signalling options. At least one management cabling is required and in general that will be the RP ethernet connection. :*Console cabling: initial configuration of the route processor (RP) of a shelf a multi- shelf system is done via the console port. The ethernet management port will only become operational after configuring it with a terminal connected to a console port. Initial configuration of a shelf is done via the console port of a RP. The console port of the 22 (switch fabric shelf) or 2 port (line card shelf) SCGE card (see below) cannot be used to configure a new system. If you want all console ports of each RP connected you can use a terminal server :*AUX port: provides remote out of band access to the RP, similar to the console port, but is meant for remote access via a modem :*Management ethernet port:This will be the main means of configuring and managing the system after initial configuration. In general the ethernet ports of each RP in the system will be connected to an out-of-band ethernet LAN so you keep control over the system even when the CSR wouldn't be able to route any data. If the CSR is installed at the same location as the configuration system you will probably use a dedicated ethernet LAN. If the CSR is in a different location you will probably connect this (configuration) management (V)LAN with your NOC via a network connection that doesn't use the CRS to route the data (or you have a fall-back method such as ISDN access to the local management LAN) :*Alarm-Out cabling: You can use the external alarm-out circuits to raise alarms with the power modules :*External network clocking: If you use an external clock to synchronize your network components you can 'feed' this clock into all shelves.Cabling instruction for the Management, alarm and clock cabling in CRR Multishelf cabling guide, visited 6 December 2010 Controller cabling For the controller cabling Cisco have created a special module for use in the fabric card chassis: the 22 port Shelf Controller Gigabit Ethernet module the SC-GE-22. And on the LCC's you use the two ethernet interfaces provided with the two RP's in each chassis. In a single SFC with two LCC you will install both SC-GE-22 modules in the single SFC and each interface of the RP connect twice to the single SFC. In a 2 x 2 setup one GE port of each RP connects to one SFC and the other GE port connects to the other SFC. In a four SFC setup the first RP connects to SFC 1 and 3 while the other RP of that shelf connects to SFC 2 and 4. To allow for redundancy you will connect each ethernetport0 interface of each RP to a port on the first FC-FE-22 and each interface 1 to the second SC-FE-22. And to allow for communication between the two Sc-FE-22 modules (creating a mesh-network) you connect port 22 of each SC-FE-22 to each other. In a dual SFC each SC-FE-22 has a direct (full mesh) link to all 3 other SC-FE-22 and in a 4 SFC system you also create a full-mesh network between all FC-FE-22 modules. This cabling means that for a one SFC and two LCC you will need 8+1 ethernet cables for network control, in a dual SFC you will need 14 cables (8xSC-LC + 6 LCC mesh) and in a 4 SFC-2 LCC you need 8 LC cables and 28 SFC-SFC mesh cables.Cabling instruction for the Control cabling in CRR Multishelf cabling guide, visited 6 December 2010 Fabric cabling And finally you need the fabric cabling that will carry the actual data or payload between the line card chassis and the switch fabric chassis. For the interconnection the system uses 8 fabric planes, numbered 0 to 7. In combination with that it uses a 3 components or stages. When a packet arrives via an interface on a linecard in a LCC (the ingress FCC) it is on stage 1, then goes to the switch-fabric (stage 2) and then to the destination line-card (stage 3). It is of course possible that the linecard of the ingress resides in the same shelf as the egress line card, but this same 3 stage model is being used.Cabling instruction for the Fabric cabling in CRR Multishelf cabling guide, visited 6 December 2010 In the LCC's you use stage 1 and 3 cards: S13 cards. In a SFC you have stage 2 cards S2. In a single SFC setup all 8 S2 cards reside in the single SFC, in a multi SFC setupthe S2 cards are distributed over the SFC's. For the communication based on two line-card chassis you will need 72 fibres (3(S1,2,3) x 8(#planes) x 3(2xLCC+1FCC). Even when you have more than one SFC you still use 72 cables: in a two SFC setup 50% of the fibres from LCC connect to SFC1 and 50% to SFC2 and similar to a 4 node system). These cables can be ordered in lengths of 10‚Äì100 meters in steps of 5 meters, and come in sets of 24. Thus to interconnect a system you need 3 sets of the required length Cisco CRS multishelf cabling guide Ordering Fabric cables, visited 3 December 2010 In the future configurations with more than two LCC's will be supported, but currently a multi-shelf configuration supports two line card chassis and 1,2 or 3 switch fabric chassis.

Much of his later life was dedicated to depicting Herman Melville's Moby Dick. In 1955 a short film using this body of artwork won a Silver Reel Award at the Venice Film Festival. Early life Wilson was born on March 4, 1907, in Terre Haute to parents Martha and Wilton A. Wilson, a banker. He attended McLean Junior High and graduated from Garfield High School in 1925. As an active Boy Scout, Gilbert Wilson held a fifteen-year veteran pin and achieved a Silver Eagle rank. Education Wilson attended Indiana State Normal (now Indiana State University) and studied under professor of art William T. Turman. In 1928 he began instruction at the Chicago Art Institute, where he exhibited at the Hoosier Salon and won two awards, as wells as a two-hundred dollar prize in 1929 and 1930. Wilson was considered a poor student. He didn't take courses as outlined, and even failed to follow the venerable tradition of copying old masters, drawing miserably. Instead, he spent his time drawing prehistoric men and animals in the Field Museum, and the world's flora and fauna. In Chicago, Wilson met mural painter Eugene Savage due to the Hoosier Prize, whom he learned the craft of murals at Yale School of Fine Arts. After three months of diligent labor, Wilson left Yale and went home. He wrote Savage that he couldn't stand that sort of artistic life; that he would much rather work and live with the master, as had been the apprentice's way for centuries before. Thus it happened that for the next ten months Wilson became part of the Savage household in Ossining, New York. During this time Wilson rendered color composition and design to rolls of architectural blueprints, did various household chores, came twice a month for the regular shopping tour to New York, and painted incidentals for the remainder of the Elks Memorial murals. This was his only canvas-oil experience except for the three still lifes of his schooldays. Wilson became enamored with the work of prominent muralists Diego Rivera and Jos√© Orozco and travelled to Mexico to study under Rivera; there he would also study with sculptor Urbici Soler. \\"Great art can and must be universal‚Äîbut of necessity it must have its origin in a locality... Great art must be in touch with life, must function through some means and link itself up with the common everyday experience of the people.\\" wrote Wilson from Mexico. Philosophy Inspired by Rivera, Orozco and Savage, as well as Terre Haute-area thinkers like social activist Eugene Debs and writers Theodore Dreiser and Max Ehrmann, much of Wilson's work concerns the plight of the common man. Common themes in his murals are war, capitalism, industrialization and ecological issues. Wilson believed that the lowest form of art is regional; the highest universal. Wilson later recalled how seeing Orozco's work for the first time had been a revelation, saying, \\"From that moment on I knew it was what I wanted Art to be ‚Äî a real, vital, meaningful expression, full of purpose and intention, having influence and relation to people's daily lives ‚Äî a part of life. Here was the first modern art I had ever seen.\\" qtd. in Wilson did not always find support from his community during his time in Terre Haute, particularly finding conflict with the town's affluent, who found his motifs of oppression and social change unappealing. He dealt with frustration and depression through much of his career, even destroying part of his own mural in Indiana State University's Laboratory School. Other common themes were multicultural community and racial equality. In 1960 Wilson was artist in residence at Kentucky State College and proposed a set of murals for the gymnasium depicting black history. However, the gymnasium burned down before the murals were undertaken, and Wilson was later fired from his position there for his communist beliefs. His oil painting John Henry, from this time period, was possibly a study for these murals. Works link=File:Gilbert_Wilson's_portion_of_the_%22machine_mural%22.png Many of his murals can be found in schools and other public places including Antioch College, New York City's School of Sculpture, School of Dance (Columbus, Ohio), the Spink Wawasee Hotel, Chicago's Lincoln Park building and local community theaters in Terre Haute. Woodrow Wilson Middle School murals A portion of the \\"Liberation\\" mural at Woodrow Wilson Middle SchoolWilson's first job upon returning to his hometown in 1933 was a set of four murals at Woodrow Wilson Middle School. Called \\"Liberation\\", these large- scale chalk murals can be found directly inside the main entrance of the building and took Wilson three years to complete, ending in 1935. The murals, which span three walls, depict images of industrialization, capitalism, greed, agriculture, warfare and a needy populace. A portion of the mural shows four Boy Scouts of different ethnic backgrounds clasping hands with a quote showing Wilson's \\"respect and admiration\\" for scouting. Upon completion of the murals, the school board refused to pay or reimburse Wilson for his work. His only payment was a collection of coins by the school's students that totalled $28. Partially due to the presence of Wilson's murals, the school is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Indiana State University A mural in ISU's University Hall (formerly the Laboratory School) was completed by Wilson in 1936 after six weeks of work. Funded by the Works Progress Administration, themes of the work include an anti-war sentiment coupled with poor stewardship of the earth, Dust Bowl devastation and the necessity for multicultural collaboration. Wilson's own writings about the work state that the mural \\"is an attempt to state thru the medium of form and color the greatest problem facing civilization today. That problem is WASTE. Waste of the earth upon which we live and the waste of human life.\\" Wilson's creativity and local sensibility was made all the more evident when artist Bill Wolfe restored the mural in 2009 and realized that Wilson had used clay from the nearby Wabash River in some of his colors, Rembrandt chalk pastels, and was left-handed. \\"Originally the mural wrapped its way around and down the hallway until one afternoon Wilson was provoked by someone in maintenance,\\" Lustig said. \\"In a flurry of outrage he washed away the outer walls. His father paid to have the walls repainted and brought to their original condition.\\" The university is home to six works by Wilson in all. One visible mural called \\"The Bean Pickers\\" (dated 1932) is in the foyer of Tilson Auditorium. Another work depicting professor Fred Donaghy was lost in 1998 when the Classroom Building where the mural was located was razed. Antioch College A portion of Gilbert Brown Wilson's mural in the Antioch College Wellness Center The Curl Gymnasium of Antioch College's Wellness Center is the home of his eponymous mural, which was dedicated as a class gift by the Antioch College Class of 1938 to the school. Separated into three sections titled \\"Collapse,\\" \\"Man Emerges,\\" and \\"Order,\\" this mural evoked themes such as racial and gender equality, the destructive spread of fascism in Europe, the collapse of modern civilization under capitalism, and the relationship between man and nature. Wilson described in the 1939 Antioch Alumni Bulletin that \\"in the mural, where I have sought to paint the collapse of modern civilization under capitalism, it is but a picture of what one artist feels is ahead if something is not done.\\" Moby Dick After reading Herman Melville's Moby Dick in the late 1940s, Wilson created numerous artworks around the book, which he viewed as a guide for the betterment of humanity. In 1955 a short film using his artwork won a Silver Reel award at the Venice Film Festival. The next year, Wilson traveled with his Moby Dick paintings and drawings on a 27-state tour. Writings In addition to his artwork, Wilson was a published writer. In the late 1930s, Wilson had numerous conversations about art, politics and current events with novelist Sherwood Anderson which would become the subject of his piece \\"A Mural Portrait of Sherwood Anderson.\\" Wilson also published an interview with cartoonist Art Young in the summer 1938 issue of Direction Magazine, including portraits of Young both by Wilson and by Jos√© Clemente Orozco. Legacy The definitive collection of Wilson's work was bequeathed to the Swope Art Museum in Terre Haute after Wilson's death. A 2007 exhibit Gilbert Wilson, Native Son commemorated the centennial of his birth. Actor Walter Huston and his son, film director John Huston, were both champions of Wilson‚Äôs work. The elder Huston co-sponsored (with author Pearl S. Buck) an exhibition of Wilson‚Äôs work at New York City‚Äôs Arthur U. Newton Galleries in May of 1949. Wilson also used Walter as a model for at least one of his paintings of Ahab from Moby-Dick. John Huston called Wilson ‚Äúa brilliant artist and one of America‚Äôs foremost painters.‚Äù Wilson was known to give many of his works away, which is why some of them have been found at estate sales and thrift stores. Indiana State University professor Edward Spann wrote a full-length biography of Wilson but died before it could be published. It remained unpublished due to the wishes of his widow for more than a decade, until Wilson's family entrusted author and editor Robert K. Elder to edit and publish Unfinished and Unbroken: The Life of Artist Gilbert Wilson. In 2016, during a visit to the Swope Art Museum, Elder saw the exhibition Good Intentions: Two Unrealized Projects by Gilbert Brown Wilson. Co-curated by former director Susan Baley, and current curator Edward Trover, the exhibition displayed Wilson's Old Mister World and the Hue-Mans: A Fable of the Earth and the Atom, and panel studies for his unrealized Moby Dick mural for the library in Frankfort, Kentucky. Inspired by the exhibition, Robert K. Elder gathered images for the book Moby-Dick: Illustrated by Gilbert Wilson with publisher Hat & Beard Press.

He was a son of the diplomat Count Fran√ßois Gabriel von Bray, who was from Rouen, France.  Early life  Bray-Steinburg came from the old Norman family of Bray. He was a son of the Bavarian diplomat Count Fran√ßois Gabriele von Bray (originally from Normandy) and Baroness Sophia Catherine von L√∂wenstern. His main residence was the castle of Irlbach, south of Regensburg, but he also owned the nearby castles of Schambach and Steinburg. Bray-Steinburg was taught in the Wilhelmsgymnasium in Munich and then studied law at the Universities of G√∂ttingen and Munich.  Career  He then served as a Bavarian diplomat in Vienna, Paris and Athens. In 1843 to 1859, Bray was, with interruptions, the Bavarian ambassador in Sankt Petersburg. In 1846 to 1847, and again in 1848 to 1849, he was the Bavarian foreign secretary. During his second term, he also served as President of the Council of Ministers, a title equivalent to prime minister. In 1859 to 1860, Bray was the Bavarian ambassador in Berlin, and he then returned to Vienna as ambassador. In 1870, King Ludwig II. appointed Bray again Minister of State of the Exterior and Council president. In that position, Bray led the Bavarian delegation for the negotiations of the Bavarian accession to the German Empire and managed to secure a privileged status for the Kingdom of Bavaria within the empire (Reservatrechte). The Kingdom of Bavaria was able to retain its own railways, postal service, diplomatic body and even its own army, which would fall under Prussian command only during times of war. In 1871, Bray resigned since he was in opposition to the Kulturkampf. He then served again as the German Empire's ambassador in Vienna until 1897. He was awarded Serbian Order of the Cross of Takovo.  Marriage and children  He married Donna Ippolita Emanuela, Princess Dentice di Frasso from Naples, daughter of Prince Luigi VI Dentice di Frasso and Donna Anna Maria Serra. They had issue: Countess Clara von Bray-Steinburg born 1848, married Count Ludwig von Lerchenfeld-K√∂fering in 1867. Count Hippolyte von Bray-Steinburg born 1842, married Countess Anna von Medem in 1871.

Australia's China: Changing Perceptions from the 1930s to the 1990s. Cambridge University Press, 1996. p.302. . The Chinese government's response was denounced, particularly by Western governments and media.\\"China: Aftermath of the Crisis\\" State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research, (27 July 1989) Criticism came from both Western and Eastern Europe, North America, Australia and some east Asian and Latin American countries. Notably, many Asian countries remained silent throughout the protests; the government of India responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to pare down the coverage to the barest minimum, so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China, and to offer political empathy for the events.Places 20 years apart ‚Äì column by C. Raja Mohan, Indian Express, 4 June 2009 Pakistan, North Korea, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany, among others, supported the Chinese government and denounced the protests. Overseas Chinese students demonstrated in many cities in Europe, America, the Middle East, and Asia against the Chinese government.Troubles in China provoke protests, Spokane Chronicle, 7 June 1989, page A8  National reaction  Some Chinese citizens deplored the incident at Tiananmen Square and believed that the massacre of peaceful protesters had been done with such brutal force to prevent any further protests by citizens. In the immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests the Communist Party of China maintained its original condemnation of the student demonstrations (see April 26 Editorial) and characterized the crackdown as necessary to maintain stability. Government sources downplayed the violence against demonstrators on June 3 and 4, and portrayed the public as supportive of the crackdown. In the days after the protest, the CCP attempted to control access to information on the massacre, confiscating film from foreign journalists. Domestic journalists who had been sympathetic to the student movement were removed from their positions, and several foreign journalists were expelled from China. On June 6, State Council spokesman Yuan Mu held a press conference where he claimed that there had been 300 fatalities during the massacre, with no killings having occurred in Tiananmen Square itself. Yuan Mu portrayed the crackdown as a response to \\"a counterrevolutionary rebellion in the early hours of the morning of June 3.\\" In August 1989, the Chinese government released its complete, official account of the Tiananmen protests, The Truth About the Beijing Turmoil. The narrative presented in The Truth About the Beijing Turmoil differs significantly from the accounts of student leaders and foreign journalists, many of which are banned in China. On the origins of the protest the book states: \\"This turmoil was not a chance occurrence. It was a political turmoil incited by a very small number of political careerists after a few years of plotting and scheming. It was aimed at subverting the socialist People's Republic.\\" This contradicts the statements of student leaders, who emphasised the spontaneous nature of their decisions to join the protest and their desire to work within the political system. On the June 4 crackdown and its aftermath The Truth About the Beijing Turmoil recounts: \\"The measures adopted by the Chinese government to stop the turmoil and put down the rebellion have not only won the acclaim and support of the Chinese people, but they have also won the understanding and support of the governments and peoples of many other countries. The Chinese government has announced that it will unswervingly carry on the policy of reform and opening to the outside world‚Ä¶\\" Due to the ongoing censorship in China, it is difficult to verify the claim that the government crackdown had popular support. In the book The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited, Chen Guang, a soldier who participated in the June 4 crackdown, describes the attitudes of citizens following the protests, \\"The residents suddenly changed to become really nice to the soldiers. I thought about this a lot at the time. It really confused me. Why was it like that? On June 4th, all the residents supported the students. So overnight how did they come to support the soldiers?\\" In the weeks after the crackdown, Chinese state news focused largely on the aggression of protesters and their killing of PLA soldiers. Footage of Liu Guogeng, who was beaten to death by protesters before being immolated, and his grieving family was shown repeatedly in government television broadcasts during June 1989. State media showed mourners laying wreaths and flowers at the site where Liu was killed. The families of demonstrators and bystanders who were killed during the protest have in some cases been forbidden from engaging in public mourning. In the decades since the Tiananmen Square protests the CCP has attempted to prevent any remembrance of the protest movement and the subsequent crackdown. While the government initially tried to justify its suppression of the protest, releasing official statements and creating museum exhibits on the events of June 3‚Äì5, it now denies that such suppression ever occurred. In 2011, an opinion piece, \\"Tiananmen Square a Myth\\", was published in China Daily, the CCP's English-language newspaper. The article claims that, \\"When eventually troops were sent in to clear the [Tiananmen] square, the demonstrations were already ending. But by this time the Western media were there in force, keen to grab any story they could.\\" There is no mention of a counterrevolutionary rebellion, as earlier government accounts refer to. As Louisa Lim notes in her book, The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited, many young Chinese know almost nothing of the Tiananmen Square protests. In an informal survey, Lim showed the iconic photo of Tank Man to 100 Chinese university students; only 15 correctly identified it as being an image of Tiananmen Square. Perry Link, a Chinese language and literature scholar, writes, \\"The story of the massacre is banned from textbooks, the media, and all other public contexts.\\" In 2014, Gu Yimin, a Chinese activist, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for attempting to hold a march on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. After filing a request to hold the march in 2013, he was charged with \\"inciting subversion of state power.\\" Activist groups such as the Tiananmen Mothers have faced intense government surveillance for their attempts to hold the CCP accountable for the losses of their family members. Currently, the Chinese government blocks all website based searches in China with any regard to the massacre at Tiananmen Square.Straub, G. (2001). Rhythm of Compassion. Tuttle Publishing. p. 111. . However, the period of relative political stability, order and economic growth that resulted after the crackdown from 1990 till 2012 saw steadily rising Chinese standards of living, with over 663 million (according to the World Bank) Chinese citizens lifted out of poverty. Trust and legitimacy of the Chinese government also remained high and increased from 83% in 2007 to 87% in 2010 according to the 2010 Pew Research Center Study. It also found that the Chinese people were satisfied (87%) with their Government and feel that their country is moving in the right direction (74%). Organizations ;: Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was concerned at the incident, adding that the government should uphold the utmost restraint, but also noted that the UN Charter prohibits interference in member states' internal affairs (especially member states with a Security Council veto).\\"Bush halts arms sales to China.\\" Chicago Tribune, 6 June 1989. From 7 August to 1 September 1989 the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (a part of the Commission on Human Rights) met in Geneva for its thirty-seventh meeting. This meeting was the first time since the killings in June \\"that a human rights meeting ha[d] begun discussing the subject.\\"\\"U.N. Panel Is Asked to Condemn China\\", The New York Times, 17 August 1989. (accessed 26 November 2010). At the meeting resolution 1989/5 was adopted by secret ballot on 31 August 1989. The resolution, also called \\"Situation in China\\" states the Committee was concerned about what had occurred in China and the implications the crackdown would have on the future of human rights.Commission on Human Rights, \\"Report of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities on its Forty-First Session\\", E/CN.4/1990/2, page 34, resolution 1989/5. The resolution has two points: # Requests the Secretary- General to transmit to the Commission on Human Rights information provided by the Government of China and by other reliable sources; # Makes an appeal for clemency, in particular in favour of persons deprived of their liberty as a result of the above-mentioned events. On 1 December 1989 the permanent representative of People's Republic of China (PRC) to the United Nations Ambassador Li Luye replied to the Sub-Commission's adoption of resolution 1989/5 by stating that it was \\"a brutal interference in China's internal affairs.\\"Commission on Human Rights, \\"Question of the Violation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in any part of the World, with particular reference to Colonial and other Dependent Countries and Territories\\", E/CN.4/1990/52, page 2, paragraph 3; page 32‚Äì33, paragraph 65; page 33, paragraph 66. Li also stated that the \\"Spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on 2 September 1989, solemnly declaring the firm objection of the Chinese Government to the resolution and deeming it to be illegal and null and void.\\" At the forty-sixth session of the Commission on Human Rights in January 1990 Li distributed a letter as a document for the meeting. In the letter Li reaffirms the position of the Chinese Government toward the resolution and that \\"actions to put an end to the turmoil and quell the rebellion were justified and legitimate.\\"Commission on Human Rights, Letter from Ambassador Li Luye, E/CN.4/1990/55, page 3‚Äì4. He also states that the punishment of \\"criminals\\" who have \\"violated the criminal law\\" is justified and that a small number of Western nations are using the United Nations to interfere internal affairs, which is a clear and complete violation of the UN Charter and international relations. The forty-sixth session found the Chinese claim of interference in internal affairs indefensible and that \\"massive violation\\" of human rights concerned of the international community.

Many overseas Chinese, however, view the 4 June Incident as yet another example of communist repression in a long string of similar incidents.G.P Deshpande, \\"The Chinese Political System in the Wake of Tiananmen,\\" China Report 27, no. 4 (1991): 269 Hong Kong Following the crackdown, rallies supporting Tiananmen Square protesters erupted throughout the world. In the days following the initial crackdown, 200,000 people in Hong Kong formed a massive rally, one of the largest in Hong Kong's history, to mourn the dead and protest the Chinese government's brutality.Eric Skelton, \\"CHINA: THE TIANANMEN MASSACRE Emotional crowd of 30,000 marches on consulate,\\" The Globe and Mail, 5 June 1989 A9 This protest was also tinged with fear, however, as the spectre of reunification with China hung over their heads.

But many Hong Kong denizens continued to protest the crackdown in the PRC, calling for unity with the Chinese people in fighting for democracy. Following the massacre, Hong Kong's largest ever protest erupted as people protested in support of the student movement. This protest was organized by the newly created Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. Over 1.5 million joined the march. Hong Kong's protest was the largest protest against the crackdown outside Beijing.  Taiwan  While many in the Taiwan also protested the CCP's handling of the 4 June crackdown, going so far as to stage a \\"hands across the island\\"Richard Bernstein, \\"In Taiwan, Sympathies Lean Toward Home,\\" New York Times, 4 June 1989, 121 demonstration, there seemed to be an ambivalence to the events in China. Chou Tien-Jui, publisher of a weekly news magazine called The Journalist commented that \\"people in Taiwan think that Tiananmen Square is very far away. ... They think that we have plenty of local issues to be concerned about.\\" Other than the Hands across the island demonstration, there seemed to only be a \\"muted and controlled local response to the upheaval in China.\\"CRACKDOWN IN BEIJING; IN TAIWAN, SYMPATHY AND ALOOFNESS, New York Times, 4 June 1989.

Five Hundred Chinese Canadians rallied in front of the Chinese consulate in Vancouver. In Halifax, one hundred Chinese students protested the actions of the PLA and the resulting violence. Chinese students at the University of Manitoba held their protests in the provincial legislature. Allan Chan, from the University of Calgary, commented that the government action was inevitable because \\"the students tried to push too hard ... [and that] you can't change a whole society overnight\\". Yan Xiaoqiao, a PhD chemistry student enrolled in Simon Fraser University, said \\"today is one of the darkest days in Chinese history\\". Many of the Chinese foreign exchange students studying in Canada opted to apply for permanent residency in the aftermath of 4 June rather than return to China.Wendy Stueck, \\"Tough choices for Chinese: Many students apply for residency following Tiananmen massacre,\\" The Vancouver Sun, Sept 11, 1989, B6 There were international responses toward the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. In Vancouver, British Columbia, the Chinese community was among those who stood up against the Chinese Communist Party's decision to take military action against student protesters. To demonstrate their support of the students in Tiananmen Square, various Chinese Canadian Organizations protested in Vancouver. Vancouver's Chinese community protests Goddess of Democracy replica at the Vancouver campus of the University of British Columbia Using tactics similar to those used by the university students in Beijing, 1,000 protesters took to Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia and marched to the Chinese Consulate. The Vancouver Sun reported that protesters wore black armbands, carried banners with slogans like \\"Li Peng, you are a beast!\\" or \\"Today's menu Deng Xiaoping Stew‚ÄîFree delivery all over China\\" and demanded a statement from the consul- general.Gawthrop, Dan. \\"1000 in City Protest Killings Series: China in Crisis.\\" The Vancouver Sun, 5 June 1989, p. B1. Members of various Chinese organizations attended the demonstration including vice-president of the Chinese Benevolent Association of Canada, Gim Huey. Huey said that the weekend massacre in Beijing has ended support for state communism in China. Chinese university students from British Columbia also participated in the events. A student from the University of Victoria said, \\"Tiananmen Square has never been attacked by any government, even the Japanese, Chinese culture has a long civilization that was destroyed by the government\\". In the following weeks the demonstrations continued. On 6 June 1989, 5,000 members of the Vancouver Chinese community, also marched down Granville Street in Vancouver to the Chinese Consulate and held a 40-minute candlelight memorial service.The Province. \\"5,000 Here Chide China.\\" 7 June 1989. p. 4. Six days later, on 12 June 1989, more members of the Vancouver's Chinese community rallied in Vancouver's Chinatown. A group of 13,000 protesters joined this rally, which was followed by a speech by local political leader, Ed Broadbent of the New Democratic Party. Broadbent called for the immediate withdrawal of the Canadian Ambassador in China and an emergency debate of the crisis by the United Nations Security Council.McLellan, Wendy. \\"Beijing Ambassador's Withdrawal Called For.\\" Vancouver Sun, 12 June 1989, p. B1. Afterward, demonstrators took turns expressing their feelings about the Chinese Government's decisions to use military violence on students. A Chinese student from Simon Fraser University stated, \\"For each of those who have fallen, 1,000 Chinese will come forward and rise up\\".Rees, Ann. \\"Thousands Mourn.\\" The Province, 12 June 1989, p. 4. Dispute over the Goddess of Democracy in Vancouver On 22 August 1989, Vancouver's Chinese community, as well as other human rights activists, united at Robson Square to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre with an art exhibition. The exhibition displayed different media sources such as videos, images, news clippings, and included discussions for a replica of the Beijing students, 'Goddess of Democracy'.Parton, Nicole. \\"Goddess of Democracy a Hot Lady in Vancouver.\\" The Vancouver Sun, 22 August 1989. After the exhibition, the community debated on an appropriate space for a replica statue. Members of Vancouver's 'Society in Support of Democratic Movement' believed a replica of the 'Goddess of Democracy' should be placed in Vancouver's Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden The garden's namesake is the nationalist leader, considered to be the father of modern China). However, the garden's boards of trustees did not want the statue, because the garden was not a political forum. Others speculate that the trustees did not want the statue because the Chinese Communist Party donated more than $500,000 to the building of the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Garden. The 'Goddess of Democracy' debate continued on 26 August 1989 and Gim Huey, chairman of Vancouver's Chinese Benevolent Association, pleaded that the statue must be in Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Garden, stating that it was \\"not political\\" but was \\"promoting freedom and democracy\\".Farrow, Moira. \\"Democracy Statue Squabble Intensifies.\\" The Vancouver Sun, 26 August 1989, p G15. Huey believed that \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen stood for freedom and that's the whole spirit of the Garden\\". When talks with the Vancouver Parks Board failed, the proposed replica statue had no home. Finally, after much lobbying, the 'Vancouver Society in Support for the Democracy Movement' was optimistic when new talks began with the University of British Columbia. Reportedly, \\"the society approached UBC through a campus organization of Chinese students and scholars and got a warm welcome\\".Farrow, Moira. \\"Tiananmen Statue site proposed: Society seeks UBC site for the replica of Tiananmen statue.\\" The Vancouver Sun, 4 October 1990 P. A18. Talks were successful in finding the statue a home, and these plans were followed through as the 'Goddess of Democracy' statue was moved to the grounds of the University of British Columbia. Split over National Day in Vancouver China's National Day, celebrated on 1 October, further stirred up feelings over the Tiananmen Square Massacre. National Day celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China. In Vancouver, the Chinese community was divided on how to celebrate National Day. Two separate events were planned. Supporters for democracy in China proposed a 24-hour fast along with a reenactment of the Beijing students' tent camps.Hendrinkson, Bob. \\"For friends and Foes of China: Protests set up to counter Anniversary Celebration in Vancouver.\\" The Province, 29 September 1989 P. 41. The Chinese Cultural Center and Chinese Benevolent Association proposed that regular National Day events like lion dancing and dinner should take place. Bill Chu from the 'Canadian Christians for Democratic Movement in China' claimed that, decisions to continue regular National Day celebrations were another Chinese government cover-up and said that telephone polls showed that \\"71.6% of Vancouver's Chinese community opposed celebrations\\". Tommy Toa, former director of the Chinese Benevolent Association stated, \\"To celebrate national Day without condemnation of the current Chinese government is hypocritical [...] I believe if we celebrate anything we should celebrate the courage and determination of the Chinese people seeking democracy\\".Farrow, Moira. \\"Chinese Community Split Seen: National Day Events Differ.\\" The Vancouver Sun, 25 August 1989 p. B1. In reaction to the pro-democracy stance, the director of the Chinese Cultural Center Dr. K.T Yue said that because Canada still recognized the Chinese government, \\"we go along with the government\\", even though he sympathized with the democracy movement. On 1 October 1989, the National Day events unfolded with two clear stances. A protest of more than 500 pro-Democracy supporters, was held outside the Main Street SkyTrain station in Vancouver, against the Tiananmen Square Massacre.Wong, Victor Chew. \\"Chinese Split on National Day.\\" The Province, 1 October 1989, p 25. Chan Kwok-Kin criticized those who attended the regular National Day celebrations stating, \\"I think those who are feasting are doing so for personal gain\\". Others like the Chinese Benevolent Association's president, Bill Yee, defended their National Day celebration, arguing that it was rooted in a 30-year-old tradition.  Setting a precedent in law ‚Äì United States  As veterans of the 4 June movement settled into lives in their adopted countries, some, like Wang Dan, chose to continue the fight against the CCP.

He died at age 43 when the aircraft he was flying was sabotaged to crash. Military career During World War II he flew Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 aircraft in the Aerosiluranti (torpedo bomber) squadrons of Regia Aeronautica with the rank of Tenente. After 8 September 1943 he chose to fight for the Italian Social Republic as a member of the Gruppo Aerosiluranti Buscaglia-Faggioni. Commander of the 2nd Squadron of Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, he led several torpedo bombing raids against the Allied fleet at Anzio and Gibraltar, often by night, since Bertuzzi was exceptionally skilled in instrument flight. Bertuzzi was awarded two Silver Medals and one Bronze Medal of Military Valor during the war. Flying for Mattei In the years following World War II, after a long period flying with Alitalia and a stint with Douglas DC-6s in South America, he was hired by Eni in 1958 to lead the company's aircraft fleet. The chairman, Enrico Mattei, trusted him implicitly despite his being a decorated ex- partisan and Bertuzzi an ex-fascist. Bertuzzi was at the controls of Mattei's Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris executive jet (I‚ÄìSNAP) when it crashed in the countryside surrounding Bascap√® in the province of Pavia, on 27 October 1962. Besides Bertuzzi and Mattei, American Time‚ÄìLife journalist William McHale was also killed in the crash.Giorgio Galli, Enrico Mattei: petrolio e complotto italiano, Milano, Baldini Castoldi Dalai, 2005 Shortly before takeoff on the fateful flight, he had announced to Mattei his intention to quit his job to take the lead in a new society called Alis. Four months after the crash, the first enquiry was dismissed, attributing the liability of the disaster to the pilot's physical and psychological status and to technical malfunctions. In 2003, however the inquiry of the Pavia Deputy Public Prosecutor Vincenzo Calia ascertained that the crash was caused by the explosion of ca. 100 gr. of Composition B planted behind the instrument panel and directly on the landing gear lowering mechanism. At the time of his death, Bertuzzi had logged 11,236 flying hours of which 625 were on the MS.760 aircraft.

She has been active in the genres of transmedia storytelling and alternate reality games (ARGs), in a variety of roles, since 2001. She has written for, designed, or substantially participated in the creation of Perplex City, the BAFTA-nominated Routes (a project of Channel 4), and The 2012 Experience, a marketing campaign for the film 2012. Entry to alternate reality gaming Phillips came to the genre in 2001, when she co-moderated the Cloudmakers mailing list which served players of \\"The Beast\\", the ARG which revolved around the release of the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The Cloudmakers community encompassed thousands of players of the game and eventually included a \\"guide,\\" walking players step-by-step through the game as it happened, a \\"journey\\", describing in prose the content of the game and its backstory, and a \\"trail\\", functioning as an FAQ to organize the multiple sites and widespread information sources present within the game. As a player of the game, Phillips co-wrote \\"the journey\\" and contributed to versions 4.5 through 9.0 of \\"the trail\\". Work in transmedia Perplex City In 2005, Phillips transitioned from being a player of transmedia and alternate reality games to being a designer of them. She was hired by Mind Candy as an \\"'ad hoc' polymath\\", doing \\"'a little bit of whatever it takes to keep the game rolling,' be it designing and writing puzzles, or live event coordination.\\". Perplex City was the first \\"freestanding\\" alternate reality game to run as a stand-alone project rather than as a marketing vehicle for a traditional media project and Phillips stayed with the project until Mind Candy announced in 2007 that Perplex City was being put on indefinite hold. Routes In 2008, Phillips was hired as Lead Game Designer for Routes, a multimedia game targeted at British teenagers and run by Channel 4 and the Wellcome Trust. Routes included interactive Flash games, an alternate reality game, a television documentary featuring Katherine Ryan, and a series of webisode videos. The project ran live for eight weeks between January and March 2009 and won or was shortlisted for a number of industry awards. It won a 2010 International Visual Communications Association (IVCA) Gold award in the Web 2.0 category and the IVCA Grand Prix award the same year. It was also a BAFTA nominee in the Children's Interactive category in 2009 and a BIMA winner for content. Other projects Phillips has also worked as lead writer and game designer for \\"The 2012 Experience\\", an alternate reality game used as marketing for 2012, a Roland Emmerich film. Phillips also worked with Thomas Dolby in the creation of his online game \\"A Map of the Floating City\\", listed as \\"Quarter Master for game design, writing, UI.\\" The game's purpose was to promote the artists upcoming album of the same name. Credits also listed Thanks to Hollywood producer J. J. Abrams. On her own initiative, Phillips has developed Madame Zee, a Twitter stream and blog that deliver tongue-in-cheek horoscopes and advice, My Super First Day, a \\"massively collaborative storytelling project\\", and The TSA Choice, a crowdsourced activism site opposing recent changes to TSA airport screening procedures. Industry participation Phillips was a founding member of the International Game Developers Association's Special Interest Group on Alternate Reality Games and has carried out a variety of duties under that umbrella, including contributing to an Association whitepaper. She currently serves as Chairman of the Special Interest Group. She has also written extensively on the topic of transmedia on her blog, Deus Ex Machinatio. Phillips has been a presenter at numerous industry gatherings, including Foo Camp 2010, South by Southwest 2010, and an MIT conference on \\"Storytelling 3.0\\". Publications Phillips in 2012 published A Creator's Guide to Transmedia Storytelling, Amazon. 31 May 2012 as a guide for current and aspiring modern storytellers. Phillips presents techniques, guidance, and information from her own professional experience as well as from interviews with other professionals in Transmedia. In February, 2013, Phillips created a Kickstarter project to raise funds for a year-long fiction serial called The Daring Adventures of Captain Lucy Smokeheart.

OneHope is working in over 100 countries to present a biblical message of hope to children and youth through age- and culturally-specific programs including: children's magazines, storytelling, animated movies, interactive games, sports programs, smartphone apps and more. Working with churches, partner ministries, local governments, schools and non-governmental organizations, OneHope has reached more than one billion children with a relevant presentation of God's Word. The organization also conducts research in 44 countries around the world to gain insight into children's daily lives, faith, cultural influences and values. History OneHope (formerly Book of Hope International) was founded in 1987 by former missionary and Life Publishers President Bob Hoskins. That year, Hoskins was asked by the Minister of Education in El Salvador to provide Bibles to the country's 968,000 school children. Instead of Bibles, he delivered the Book of Hope‚Äîan interactive, Bible-based publication customized for the special challenges and interests of the country's children and youth. By 2000, the Book of Hope had been shared not only with children in El Salvador but also with children in Haiti, Africa and Eastern Europe. In 2004, Rob Hoskins was appointed president of OneHope. Since then, OneHope has expanded its work and is now creating new programs (in addition to the Book of Hope) for sharing the message of the Bible with children and youth, includingThe GodMan, an animated children's film about the life of Jesus Christ. Today, the Book of Hope is available in more than 140 languages, and The GodMan has been modified for ten cultural worldviews and translated into 78 languages. OneHope has also expanded to over 300 unique programs that share the gospel through storytelling, sport clinics, games, apps and other mediums. On Thanksgiving Day 2013, in partnership with YouVersion, OneHope launched the Bible App for Kids. Downloaded more than 1 million times in its first week, the app brings the Bible to life for children with dozens of fully animated stories. With over 16 million downloads, the Bible App for Kids is available in 25+ languages In February 2014, OneHope reached its billionth child with a relevant gospel message. The moment was broadcast live for OneHope partners around the world to celebrate the occasion. Research In 2007, OneHope launched a 44-country research initiative to learn more about children and youth's unique needs, experiences and social traditions around the world. Through an affiliated organization, Metadigm Group, OneHope conducts this country-specific, outcome-based research about the spiritual state of the world's children, gaining insight about children and youths' daily lives and cultural beliefs. The research reveals information about children's: * Perceptions concerning their relationships with families * Behaviors and morals, influencing their relationships with peers of the opposite sex * Daily pastimes, social influences and future goals * Worldviews, beliefs and religious affiliations International impact * In December 1990, OneHope worked with Russia's Minister of Religion, Igor Vischepan, to provide the Book of Hope to some 140 million school children in the country. The request came when the Minister of Education realized the need for moral and value-oriented education in the post-Soviet era following a Book of Hope distribution in School #715 in Russia. Since that time, more than 101 million Russian children and youth have been reached with the Gospel. *Due to the Taiwanese government's concern over the dramatic rise of problems confronting children and youth, OneHope has been asked to teach character development and values-based education classes as part of the country's school curriculum. School administrators have begun training volunteers how to use the Book of Hope teacher's manuals for weekly classes. *During the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Brazil, OneHope presented the gospel to 250,000 Brazilian young people. *Through the Lumi√®re Project in French-speaking Africa, more than 600 churches have been planted. Recognition Running Deer was the fourth partnership between ToyGun Films and OneHope. The film focuses on a high school cross country star growing up in a Native American community, who faces a barrage of personal struggles the day before the most important race of his life. OneHope uses the film in conjunction with its RISE program to reach Native American youth with the message of the Bible. It won the Grand Jury Award at dead CENTER Film Festival in 2013. In 2012, Half Good Killer was created in partnership with Toy Gun films and filmed in Cape Town, South Africa. Half Good Killer follows a jaded child soldier fighting for an African rebel force as he struggles to survive the war he was thrust into as he reawakens to the life he was destined to lead. The film is being shown domestically and internationally and has won multiple awards, including the audience award at Phoenix Film Festival. In 2011, the short film Paper Flower, created by Toy Gun Films and OneHope for use in Japan, addressed a casual form of prostitution, compensated dating. Paper Flower was honored with several awards including Best Film at the Mosaic Film Festival of Los Angeles and Best Spiritual at the Breckenridge Film Festival. En Tus Manos was another short film developed by Toy Gun Films and OneHope with the objective of fighting gang violence in Latin American countries. En Tus Manos was awarded Best Actor and Best Short Film at the Beverly Hills Film Festival and won Best Short Film, Best Directing, Best Male Supporting Actor and Best Female Actor at the Los Angeles International Film Festival in 2010.

The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum- based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù basis into existing fuel and chemical products. Gevo's investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others. Economics of isobutanol production Isobutanol is a four-carbon () alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock. It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels. Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption. Technology, engineering and production Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo's Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT, is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks. Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014. *Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo's production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM's 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri. This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo's model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment. *First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota. Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012. Target markets Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo's commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets: *Isobutanol ‚Äî Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates. In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA's standards under the Clean Air Act. The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol's low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI. *Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers ‚Äî Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant. *Hydrocarbon Fuels ‚Äî Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

Early life Eustace Chesser was born in Edinburgh on 22 March 1902, to Russian immigrants. He educated at George Watson's College and received his medical degree from the University of Edinburgh, in 1926.  Career  Chesser worked for some years as a GP in Cinderford, Manchester and spent part of the Second World War as a clinical assistant at the Tavistock Clinic.Obituary: Dr Eustace Chesser, The Times, 6 December 1973, p. 18. In 1940 he published a sex manual entitled Love Without Fear. It sold 5,000 copies but it was withdrawn, and Chesser was arrested for obscenity. Rather than pleading guilty and accepting a fine, Chesser chose to be tried by jury. Chesser, who pleaded not guilty, was later acquitted. During the course of the trial, three doctors expressed the opinion that the book served a very useful purpose.Alleged Obscene Book, The Times, 1 July 1942, pg. 2. In 1959 Chesser resigned from the British Medical Association after the BMA decided that no further copies of a booklet to which he had contributed, entitled 'Getting Married', should be issued. The BMA defended its decision on the grounds that the booklet had been criticised by other doctors who were members of the BMA.Marriage Book Withdrawn, The Times, 6 March 1959, pg. 10. Dieting Chesser authored the book Slimming for the Million in 1939. He advocated a low-carbohydrate high-protein diet.Foxcroft, Louise. (2012). Calories & Corsets: A History of Dieting Over 2, 000 Years. Profile Books. p. 119. He recommended bacon, eggs, lean meats and fresh vegetables. He argued that \\"all sugars should be avoided like the devil\\", especially chocolate which he described as \\"one of obesity's biggest allies.\\" His low-carb dieting ideas are a predecessor to the Atkins diet. A review in the British Medical Journal noted that Chesser's meat or protein diet may be deficient in essential vitamins and concluded that the book \\"does not seem practical enough for a patient or detailed enough for a doctor.\\"Reviewed Work: Slimming For The Million: The New Treatment Of Obesity. A Practical Guide For Patient And Physician by Eustace Chesser. (1939). The British Medical Journal 2 (4107): 649.  Personal life  In 1926 Chesser married Rose Morris, with whom he had a son, later the psychiatrist Edward Stewart Chesser, and a daughter. She died in 1960. Chesser later married Sheila Blayney-Jones, who survived him. In 1968 Chesser suffered a serious illness which left him physically incapacitated for the remainder of his life. Following his death, in 1973, a meeting in memory of Chesser was held at the Royal Society of Medicine.Deaths: Memorial Services,The Times, 13 February 1974, pg. 28.

Its modern successor St. Andrew's Abbey, Zevenkerken (), founded in 1899‚Äì1900, is a Benedictine abbey of the Congregation of the Annunciation. History St. Andrew's Abbey, Bruges St. Andrew's Abbey, Bruges: hand-coloured engraving from Flandria Illustrata (Antonius Sanderus, 1641) The foundation charter was signed on 22 February 1100 and ratified by Count Robert II of Flanders in June 1100. The monastery was built on what is now the site of the parish church of St. Andrew and St. Anne. The first monks arrived on 17 August 1117 from Affligem Abbey. In 1188, the priory was elevated to an abbey and became independent of Affligem, thus beginning a period of prosperity, which lasted until the 14th century. In 1240, after a long dispute between the abbot and the local parish priest, a wall was built in the church to divide it into two. In 1350 the abbey sold a piece of ground right next to the abbey itself on which the charterhouse of Sint-Anna-ter-Woestijne was built. The abbey was severely damaged during the second half of the 15th century by German lansquenets. In 1521, Emperor Charles V and his brother Ferdinand visited the monastery and attended vespers, an event which is commemorated by a plaque. In the 16th century the abbey was badly damaged by the Geuzes and most of the monks fled, leaving a community of four. It was rebuilt in the 17th century, but the constant wars and its location outside the walls of Bruges exposed it to further damage. The abbey was suppressed and destroyed in 1796 during the French Revolution; only the 16th-century tower remained standing, and is now incorporated into the parish church built subsequently. St. Andrew's Abbey, Zevenkerken View of the abbey church (\\"Zevenkerken\\") In 1898 a monk from Maredsous Abbey founded a new monastic community close to the site of the previous one. A new monastery, St. Andrew's Abbey, Zevenkerken (), was built in 1899-1900, in Neo-Romanesque-Byzantine style. The abbey church contains seven chapels in various styles, one for each of the seven great basilicas of Rome, whence the name of the new foundation (which means \\"seven churches\\" in Dutch). A school was established here in 1910, the present Abdijschool van Zevenkerken (\\"Zevenkerken Abbey School\\"), a prestigious boarding school and part of St. Andrew's Abbey. Overseas expansion In 1929, monks of St. Andrew's Abbey founded St. Andrew's Priory in China. Until 1953, the monks of the priory conducted missionary work among the people of China. In 1953, the Communists expelled all foreign priests as well as all male and female religious (monks, friars, nuns, sisters). Forced to leave China behind, in 1955 the monks purchased the Hidden Springs Ranch where St. Andrew's Priory is now situated. St. Andrew's Priory thus began its ministry in Valyermo, California, which is located in the high desert of Southern California within the boundaries of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

It is the first Presbyterian Church founded in Cedar County and the twelfth in the state of Iowa. The ten charter members of the church include: Robert Dallas, Miss Sarah Dallas, John and Isabella Ferguson, John Safley, John Chappell, Samuel Yule, Robert and Elizabeth Pirie and Elizabeth Dallas. The organizational meeting was conducted by the Rev. Michael Hummer, who was an itinerant Presbyterian missionary. By November 1847 the congregation grew to 22 members. For the first ten years the congregation had no pastor and was severed by traveling missionaries. In 1851 the congregation requested that its location be changed to Tipton. The Presbytery granted its permission and it became known as the First Presbyterian Church of Tipton. In the meantime the people in Red Oak Grove built a church and requested a separate organization. The Presbytery granted its request in October 1859, and the Presbyterian Church of Red Oak Grove was organized. The following year the relationship between the churches was dissolved and Red Oak Grove began a working relationship with the Presbyterian Church in Mechanicsville, Iowa. Henry Britcher donated land north of the church where the present manse was built in 1899. The Rev. J.C. Fawcett was the first pastor to occupy the home in 1901.

It specializes in high angle mountain rescue and mountain rescue in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington, as well as providing educational materials and information on mountain and backcountry safety. Secondary areas of operations include Central Oregon and western Washington. The organization is 100% volunteer and has about 65 field- deployable members. Portland Mountain Rescue is called upon by sheriff departments when there is a reported missing climber, hiker, or other rescue mission requiring the unit's specialized skills. Law enforcement does not climb the mountain, but relies on mountain rescue organizations for their skill, expertise, and experience.Urness: :The Clackamas County Sheriff‚Äôs Office runs the show when a climber goes missing on Mount Hood, but they lean heavily on groups like Portland Mountain Rescue to search the high altitudes and provide technical expertise. ‚ÄúThis is their backyard,‚Äù said Sgt. Robert Wurpes, spokesman for the Clackamas County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. ‚ÄúThey know the common routes and the hazards, they know what can go wrong and common mistakes people make. ‚ÄúWe set up a central hub, log everybody in and provide support, but we don‚Äôt have climbing capability. They‚Äôre the experts.\\" Since its inception, Portland Mountain Rescue has been involved in most rescues on Mount Hood. The organization's members have diverse backgrounds and professions. Their common attribute is that all are highly skilled climbers.Urness: \\"... there‚Äôs no single profile of the experts. Clarke is a retired fireman. Mark Morford is an environmental attorney. Eduardo Cartaya works for the U.S. Forest Service, and Jon Rhoderick is a recent Willamette University graduate working as a Emergency Medical Technician. ... 'Without mountain rescue, many of our paths wouldn‚Äôt cross,' Morford said. 'We have engineers, teachers, nurses, computer programmers and guys that work blue-collar jobs. I didn‚Äôt realize it when I joined, but the camaraderie of working alongside people I probably wouldn‚Äôt have met is one of the best parts of the experience.'\\" Each member spends a minimum of 30 hours training each year in necessary skills: navigation, alpine climbing, rope work, wilderness survival, patient care, and others.Urness: \\"'We bring in people who are already strong climbers,' Clarke said, 'and train them to be mountain rescuers.' Simply put, team members have to be good at everything. Maps and compass expertise, alpine climbing ability, knotcraft and wilderness survival skills are just entry-level requirements. Thirty hours of classroom and field training is required each year, focusing on a variety of skills that includes using specialized equipment and patient care in hostile conditions‚Äîgetting an injured climber packaged, warm, and comfortable for transportation.\\" Portland Mountain Rescue volunteers object to media reports suggesting the members \\"risk their own lives\\" as it is hard on their families and inaccurate. The organization has several procedures and requirements which insure its own member safety, such as working in teams of at least two on high, steep terrain.  History  Up until the 1950s, there little in the way of formal mountain rescue in Oregon. Some of the mountain climbing clubs like Mazamas and Wy'east Climbers did many rescues where their members and friends needed help. When ski patrolling began on Mount Hood, members also participated in rescues. In 1955, the groups which had been doing rescues formed MORESCO, an acronym for Mountain Rescue Council of Oregon. In 1959, MORESCO joined several other organizations from the western US and formed the Mountain Rescue Association at Timberline Lodge. By the mid 1970s, MORESCO was experiencing difficulties related to its wide geographic area; it began reorganizing into regional teams. In 1977, the Portland unit of MORESCO formed Portland Mountain Rescue.

History The abbots of Affligem Abbey, which had been the ecclesiastical owners of the parish since the bishop of Cambrai ceded it to them in 1105, decided to build a priory for women in Forest, which would eventually become Forest Abbey.Official site The first prioress was named in 1239. Also in the 13th century, the Romanesque church of Saint Denis was rebuilt in the newer Gothic style. The neighbouring abbey church was rebuilt in the 15th century.

A collective wedding or mass wedding is a marriage ceremony in which several couples are married at the same time. History In 324 BC Alexander the Great married Barsine, the eldest daughter of Darius, the king of Persia. In the same ceremony, he wed many of his leading officers and outstanding soldiers to other Persian women, about 80 couples in all.Arrian of Nicomedia describes this event in section 7.4.4-5.6 of his Anabasis. Today, these ceremonies are now performed in places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Kurdistan, Palestine, South Korea, The Philippines and Yemen. Financial considerations Mass weddings are sometimes preferred for economic and social reasons, such as the reduction of costs for the venue, officiants, decorations, as well as the celebrations afterwards which can sometimes be shared between multiple families. In 2011 a collective wedding ceremony in India involved 3,600 couples, including Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and Adivasi. Many of them were the children of poor farmers.Thousands marry in big Indian wedding, AFP, February 2, 2011 In the Philippines, mass civil or religious weddings are a common phenomenon, and are often sponsored by government and charitable groups as a form of public service. Local politicians and sometimes celebrities participate as common wedding sponsors at such mass rites, which enable couples (and by extension their children) to benefit from formal state recognition of their unions. Parish churches also regularly offer collective Nuptial Masses for their low-income congregants, at times in partnership with the secular government of that predominantly Catholic nation. Rasme Saifee Since 7 November 1960 (18th Jumada al-awwal 1380), under the guidance of Syedna Taher Saifuddin, Dawoodi Bohras have been conducting mass marriage events, at several venues, called Rasme Saifee (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸäŸÅŸä ).http://www.taiseerunnikah.org/rasme.php ?

The red handwriting in diagonal is a summary by the grand vizier of the original memorandum. The Sultan writes: \\"I have been informed. Those structures mentioned in this summary are to be rebuilt expeditiously for Jum'ah and Bayram prayers. Hatt-i humayun (Ottoman Turkish: ÿÆÿ∑ ŸáŸÖÿßŸäŸàŸÜ, Turkish: hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun or hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn), also known as hatt-i sharif (hatt-ƒ± ≈üer√Æf), is the diplomatics term for a document or handwritten note of an official nature composed by an Ottoman Sultan. The terms come from hatt (Arabic: handwriting, command), h√ºmayun (imperial) and ≈üerif (lofty, noble). These notes were commonly written by the Sultan personally, although they could also be transcribed by a palace scribe. They were written usually in response to, and directly on, a document submitted to the sultan by the grand vizier or another officer of the Ottoman government. Thus, they could be approvals or denials of a letter of petition, acknowledgements of a report, grants of permission for a request, an annotation to a decree, or other government documents. Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns could be composed from scratch, rather than as a response to an existing document. After the Tanzimat reform (1856), aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire, hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns of the routine kind were supplanted by the practice of ir√¢de-i seniyye ( meaning \\"ordonnance\\"), in which the Sultan's spoken response was recorded on the document by his scribe. There are nearly 100,000 hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns in the Ottoman archives in Istanbul. Among the more famous are the Edict (hatt-ƒ± ≈üer√Æf) of G√ºlhane of 1839 and the Imperial Reform Edict (hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun) of 1856. For the first one, the Turkish term Tanzimat Fermanƒ± is more accurate. This decree, which started the so-called Tanzimat reforms, is so called because it carries a handwritten order by the sultan to the grand vizier to execute his command. The term \\"hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun\\" can sometimes also be used in a literal sense, meaning a document handwritten by an Ottoman Sultan. Around the late Ottoman Empire, the word irade or irad√®h (as in French) was often used in European publications, but by 2014 it became disused in European languages. (info page on book at Martin Luther University) // CITED: p. 39 (PDF p. 41/338). Types of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun The hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun would usually be written to the grand vizier (Sadrazam), or in his absence, to his replacement (the ka'immak√¢m), or to another senior official such as the grand admiral (Kapudan-i Derya) or the governor-general (Beylerbey) of Rumeli. There were three types of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns: :*those addressed to a government post :*those \\"on the white\\" :* those on a document  Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun to a government post  Note by Sultan Murad IV (in thick script on top) on the appointment document of Vizier Suleiman Pasha to the post of Beylerbey of Rumeli: \\"Be it done as required.\\" Routine decrees (ferman) or titles of privilege (berat) were written by a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal (tughra). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame. The note would emphasize a particular part of his edict, urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called Hatt-ƒ± H√ºmayunla M√ºve≈ü≈üeh Ferman (ferman decorated with a hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun) or Unvanƒ±na Hatt-ƒ± H√ºmayun (hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun to the title). The note might use a clich√©d phrase like \\"to be done as required\\" (m√ªcebince amel oluna) or, \\"my command is to carried out as required and no one is to interfere with its execution\\" (emrim m√ªcebince amel oluna, kimseye m√ºdahale etmeyeler). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, in order to encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as \\"if you want to keep your head, carry out this order as required\\" (Ba≈üƒ±n gerek ise m√ªcebiyle amel oluna).  Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun on the white  Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun on the white of Mahmud II to his grand vizier to look into the maintenance of dams in Istanbul to relieve the misery of his subjects during a drought. \\"Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun on the white\\" (beyaz √ºzerine hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢yun) were documents originating with the sultan (ex officio) rather than a notation on an existing document. They were so called because the edict was written on a blank (i.e. white) page. They could be documents such as a command, an edict, an appointment letter or a letter to a foreign ruler. There also exist hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns expressing the sultan's opinions or even his feelings on certain matters. For example, after the successful defense of Mosul against the forces of Nadir Shah, in 1743, Sultan Mahmud I sent a hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun to the governor Haj Husayn Pasha, which praised in verse the heroic exploits of the governor and the warriors of Mosul.  Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun on a document  A hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn of Selim III (in thick handwriting above) on a telhis (summary) written by the grand vizier regarding his efforts to ensure a sufficient supply of meat to Istanbul for the coming Ramadan. The Sultan writes his appreciation: \\"It has become my imperial knowledge. Do even more in the future. Let me see you.\\" In normal bureaucratic procedure, a document would be submitted by the grand vizier, or his deputy the kaymakam (K√¢'immak√¢m Pa≈üa), who would summarize a situation for the Sultan, and request the Sultan's will on the matter. Such documents were called telhis (summary) until the 19th century and takrir (suggestion) later on. The Sultan's handwritten response (his command or decision) were called hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn on telhis or hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn on takrir. Other types of documents submitted to the Sultan were petitions (arzuh√¢l), sworn transcriptions of oral petitions (mahzar), reports from a higher to a lower office (≈üukka), religious reports by Qadis to higher offices (il√¢m) and record books (tahrirat). These would be called hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn on arz, hatt-ƒ± h√ºm√¢y√ªn on mahzar, etc. depending on the type of the document. The Sultan responded not only to documents submitted to him by his viziers but also to petitions (arzuh√¢l) submitted to him by his subjects following the Friday prayer. Thus, hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on documents were analogous to Papal rescripts and rescripts used in other imperial regimes. When the sultan contacted the public for Friday prayer or other occasions, people would hand in petitions addressed to him. These were later discussed and decided upon by the council of viziers. They would prepare a summary of all petitions and the action decided upon for each one. The sultan would write on the same sheet \\"I have been informed\\" (manzurum olmu≈ütur) multiple times, followed by the item number to which he is referring. When palace bureaucracy was reorganized after the Tanzimat reforms, the Sultan's decision came to be written directly by the Chief Scribe at the bottom of the summary document, and this one writing applied to all decisions.  Practices  When a petition or memo requiring the Sultan's decision was to be submitted to him, the grand vizier usually prepared an executive summary (telhis) as an attachment. In some cases, rather than prepare a separate summary document, the grand vizier or his deputy would write his summary and views diagonally, on the top or bottom margins of documents coming from lower functionaries (see an example in the first figure above). Such annotations on a written document were called derkenar. Sometimes the grand vizier would append a separate cover page on top of a proposal coming from a lower-level functionary like the Treasurer (Defterdar) or the Minister of Defence (Serasker), introducing it as, for example, \\"this is the proposal of the Defterdar\\". In such cases, the Sultan would write his hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun on the cover page. In other cases, the grand vizier would summarize the matter directly in the margin of the document submitted by the lower functionary and the Sultan would write on the same page as well. Sometimes the Sultan would write his decision on a fresh piece of paper attached to the submitted document. In most cases hatt-ƒ± humayuns were written by the Sultan himself although there exist some that were penned by the chief scribe or another functionary. Important hatt-ƒ± humayuns on the white were sometimes drafted by the head of diplomatic correspondence (Reis-√ºl Kuttab) or the Secretary of Navy (Kapudan Pa≈üa). In some cases, there were notations as to who prepared the draft of the document that was then re- written by the Sultan. Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns usually were not dated, although some, concerning withdrawal of money from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late- period hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns and irades had dates. Abdulhamid I was especially inclined to date his hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns. His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III so that he could follow up whether his orders were carried out. However, this suggestion was not adopted. Abdulhamid II used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.  Language  Upon note that the Minbar to be sent to Medina requires 134 kantars of copper, S√ºleyman I responds on the top, in his own handwriting, \\"Be it given.\\" The language of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on documents generally was a form of Turkish understandable (orally) even today and has changed little over the centuries. Many documents or annotations were short comments such as \\"I gave\\" (verdim), \\"be it given\\" (verilsin), \\"will not happen\\" (olmaz), \\"be it written\\" (yazƒ±lsƒ±n), \\"is clear/is clear to me\\" (mal√ªm oldu / mal√ªmum olmu≈ütur), \\"provide it\\" (ted√¢r√ºk edesin), \\"it has come to my sight\\" (manz√ªrum oldu / manz√ªrum olmu≈ütur), \\"be it answered\\" (cevap verile), \\"record it\\" (mukayyet olasƒ±n), \\"be it supplied\\" (ted√¢rik g√∂r√ºls√ºn), \\"be they without need\\" (\\"berh√ªrd√¢r olsunlar\\"). Some Sultans would write longer comments, starting with \\"It has become my knowledge\\" (Mal√ªmum oldu), and continue with an introduction on the topic, then give their opinion such as \\"this report's/petition's/record's/etc. appearance and meaning has become my imperial knowledge\\"(\\"... i≈übu takr√Ærin/telh√Æsin/≈üukkanƒ±n/kaimenin manz√ªr ve me'azi ma'l√ªm-ƒ± h√ºmay√ªnum olmu≈üdur\\"). Some common phrases in hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns are \\"according to this report...\\" (i≈übu telhisin m√ªcebince), \\"the matter is clear\\" (c√ºmlesi malumdur), \\"I permit\\" (izin verdim), \\"I give, according to the provided facts\\" (vech-i me≈üruh √ºzere verdim). Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns to the position often had clich√©d expressions such as \\"To be done as required\\" (M√ªcebince amel oluna) or \\"To be done as required, not to be contravened\\" (M√ªcebince amel ve hil√¢fƒ±ndan hazer oluna). Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on the white were more elaborate and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by the Sultan. They often started by addressing the recipient. The Sultan would refer to his grand vizier as \\"My Vizier\\", or if his grand vizier was away at war, would refer to his deputy as \\"Ka'immak√¢m Pa≈üa\\". Those written to other officials would often start with an expression like \\"You who are my Vizier of Rumeli, Mehmed Pasha\\" (\\"Sen ki Rumili vez√Ærim Mehmed Pa≈üa'sƒ±n\\"). The head of religious affairs (≈ûeyh√ºlislam) or the Sultan's personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully. In cases where the hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun was to be delivered ceremoniously, with an imperial sword and a cloak, as in an appointment to a high rank, there would be a flowery salutation such as \\"after I have honored you with my glorious greeting you should know that...\\" (seni sel√¢m-ƒ± ≈ü√¢hanemle te≈ürif eylediƒüimden sonra malumun ola ki...). Correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title. A note without an address was meant for the grand vizier or his deputy. History Response (ca. 1788) of Selim III on a memorandum regarding printing \\"ƒ∞sl√¢mbol\\" instead of \\"Kostantiniye\\" on new coins: \\"My Deputy Grand Vizier! My imperial decree has been that, if not contrary to current law, the word of Konstantiniye is not to be printed.\\" The earliest known hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun is the one sent by Sultan Murad I to Evrenos Bey in 1386, commending the commander for his conquests and giving him advice on how to administer people. Until the reign of Murad III, Viziers used to present matters orally to the Sultans, who would then give their consent or denial, also orally. While hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as Abd√ºlhamid I, Selim III and Mahmud II, who wanted to increase their control and be informed of everything. The content of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns tends to reflect the power struggle that existed between the Sultan and his council of viziers (the Divan). The process of using the hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun to authorize the actions of the grand vizier came into existence in the reign of Murad III. This led to a loss of authority and independence in the grand vizier while other palace people such as the Master of the Harem (Harem Aƒüasƒ±) or concubines (cariye) who had greater access to the Sultan gained in influence. By giving detailed instructions or advice, the Sultans reduced the role of the grand viziers to be just a supervisor to the execution of his commands. This situation appears to have created some backlash, as during most of the 17th century there were attempts to return to grand viziers' prestige and the power of \\"supreme proxy\\" (vekil-i mutlak) and over time hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns returned to their former simplicity. However, in the eighteenth century, Selim III became concerned by the over-centralization of the bureaucracy and its general inefficacy. He created consulting bodies (meclis-i me≈üveret) to share some of the authority with him and the grand vizier. He would give detailed answers on hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns to questions asked of him and would make inquiries as to whether his decisions were followed. The hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun became Selim III's tool to ensure rapid and precise execution of his decisions. During the reign of Mahmud II, in the early 1830s, the practice of writing on the memoranda of the grand vizier was replaced by the Chief Scribe of the Imperial Office (M√¢beyn-i H√ºm√¢yun Ba≈ükatibi) recording the Sultan's decision. After the Tanzimat, the government bureaucracy was streamlined. For most routine communications, the imperial scribe (Serk√¢tib-i ≈üehriy√¢r√Æ) began to record the spoken will (ir√¢de) of the Sultan and thus the ir√¢de (also called ir√¢de-i seniyye, i.e., \\"supreme will\\", or ir√¢de-i ≈ü√¢h√¢ne, i.e., \\"glorious will\\") replaced the hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun. The use of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on the white between the Sultan and the grand vizier continued on for matters of great importance such as high level appointments or promotions. Infrequently, the grand vizier and the Sultan wrote to each other directly as well. The large number of documents that required the Sultan's decision through either a hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun or an irade-i senniye is considered to be an indication of how centralized the Ottoman government was. Abd√ºlhamid I has written himself in one of his hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns \\"I have no time that my pen leaves my hand, with God's resolve it does not.\\" The early hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns were written in the calligraphic styles of t√¢lik, t√¢lik kƒ±rmasƒ± (a variant of t√¢lik), nesih and riq‚Äôa. After Mahmud II, they were only written in riq‚Äôa. Ahmed III and Mahmud II were skilled penmen and their hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns are notable for their long and elaborate annotations on official documents. In contrast, Sultans who accessed the throne at an early age, such as Murad V and Mehmed IV display poor spelling and calligraphy.  Archival  Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns sent to the grand vizier were handled and recorded at the √Çmedi Kalemi, the secretariat of the grand vizier. The √Çmedi Kalemi organized and recorded all correspondence between the grand vizier and the Sultan, as well as any correspondence with foreign rulers and with Ottoman ambassadors. Other hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns, not addressed to the grand vizier, were stored in other document stores (called fon in the terminology of current Turkish archivists).  Cut-out hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns  During the creation of the State Archives in the nineteenth century, documents were organized according to their importance. Hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on the white were considered the most important, along with those on international relations, border transactions and internal regulations. Documents of secondary importance were routinely placed in trunks and stored in cellars in need of repair. Presumably as a sign of respect toward the Sultan, hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on documents (petitions, reports, etc.) were cut out and stored together with the hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns on the white, while the rest of the documents were stored elsewhere. These cut-out hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns were not cross-referenced with the documents to which they referred and were only annotated by the palace office using general terms and an approximate date. Because Sultans were not in the habit of dating their hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns until the late period of the empire, in most cases the documents associated with them are not known. Conversely, the decisions on many a memorandum, petition, or request submitted to the Sultan are unknown. The separation of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns from their documents is considered a great loss of information for researchers. The Ottoman Archives in Istanbul has a special section of \\"cut-out hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns\\". Catalogs Today all known hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns have been recorded in a computerized database in the Ottoman Archives of the Turkish Prime Minister (Ba≈übakanlƒ±k Osmanlƒ± Ar≈üivleri, or BOA in short) in Istanbul, and they number 95,134. Most hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns are stored at the BOA and in the Topkapƒ± Museum Archive. The BOA contains 58,000 hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns. Because the hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns were originally not organized systematically, historians in the nineteenth and early twentieth century created several catalogs of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns based on different organizing principles. These historic catalogs are still in use by historians at the BOA: Hatt-ƒ± H√ºm√¢y√ªn Tasnifi is the catalog of the hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns belonging to the √Çmedi Kalemi. It consists of 31 volumes listing 62,312 documents, with their short summaries. This catalog lists documents from 1730 to 1839 but covers primarily those from the reigns of Selim III and Mahmud II within this period. Ali Emiri Tasnifi is a chronological catalog of 181,239 documents organized according to the periods of sovereignty of Sultans, from the foundation of the Ottoman state to the Abd√ºlmecid period. Along with hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns, this catalog includes documents on foreign relations. ƒ∞bn√ºlemin Tasnifi is a catalog created by a committee led by historian ƒ∞bn√ºlemin Mahmud Kemal. It covers the period of 1290‚Äì1873. Along with 329 hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns, it lists documents of various other types relating to palace correspondence, private correspondence, appointments, land grants (timar and zeamet), and charitable endowments (vakƒ±f). Muallim Cevdet Tasnifi catalogs 216,572 documents in 34 volumes, organized by topics that include local governments, provincial administration, vakƒ±f and internal security.  The Hatt-ƒ± H√ºm√¢yun of 1856  Although there exist thousands of hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayuns, the Imperial Reform Edict (or Isl√¢hat Ferm√¢nƒ±) of 1856 is well enough known that most history texts refer to it simply as \\"Hatt-i H√ºmayun\\". This decree from Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all, regardless of creed. In D√ºstur, the Ottoman code of laws, the text of this ferman is introduced as \\"a copy of the supreme ferman written to the grand vizier, perfected by decoration above with a hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun.\\" See footnote 4 in: So, technically this edict was a hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun to the rank. The Reform Decree of 1856 is sometimes referred to by another name, \\"The Rescript of Reform\\". Here, the word 'rescript' is used to sense of \\"edict, decree\\", not \\"reply to a query or other document.\\" The Hatt-ƒ± H√ºmayun of 1856 was an extension of another important edict of reform, the Hatt-i Sharif of G√ºlhane of 1839, and part of the Tanzimat reforms. That document is also generally referred to as \\"The Hatt-i Sharif\\", although there are many other hatt-i sharifs, a term that is synonymous with hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun.  The Sultan's script  A non-official hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun between Ahmed III and his grand vizier. \\"My Vizier. Today where do you intend to go? How is my girl, the piece of my life? Make me happy with news of the health of your holy disposition. My body is in good health, thank be God. Those of my imperial family are in good health as well. Let me know when you know.\\" The term hatt-ƒ± h√ºmayun is occasionally used in the literal sense of the handwriting of the Sultan. For example, the imperial poet Nef'i has written a masnavi of 22 couplets describing the calligraphy of Sultan Murad IV, called Der-Vasf-ƒ± Hatt-ƒ± Humayun-ƒ± Sultan Murad Han. The whole poem is a compliment to the writings of the Sultan.

History A 1907 Railway Clearing House junction diagram showing (lower right) railways in the vicinity of Letterston Junction, including part of the Clarbeston Road and Letterston Railway The Great Western Railway (GWR) originally obtained access to Ireland over the South Wales Railway, which ran via , and to , where a small port was built as part of the railway facilities; the line was opened as far as Haverfordwest in 1854, and extended to Neyland in 1856. The original proposal of 1844 (authorised by Act of Parliament in 1845) had been for the western terminus to be at Fishguard, with Haverfordwest on a branch, and by August 1847 work was in progress within of Fishguard. In 1848, the effects of the Great Irish Famine made Ireland a less attractive proposition, and work on the western end of the line stopped as a result. In 1851, work restarted, but it was decided that the western terminus should be on the Milford Haven Waterway, and Neyland was selected; the section between Clarbeston Road and Fishguard, some in length, was not built. In 1878, the Rosebush and Fishguard Railway (R&FR;) was formed, to extend the Narberth Road and Maenclochog Railway (NR&MR;), which had opened in 1876, to Fishguard; the R&FR; bought the NR&MR; in 1881 and was renamed the North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway (NP&FR;) in 1884, although it only opened approximately of new line. The NP&FR; was acquired by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Co. (F&RR;&H;) in 1894. In 1899, the F&RR;&H; sold its railways in Wales to the GWR, which completed the extension of the NP&FR; line to on 1 July 1899. A new double-track line was proposed by the GWR to shorten the distance to Fishguard; this was the Clarbeston Road and Letterston Railway, which opened on 30 August 1906 between Clarbeston Junction ( from Paddington) and Letterston Junction (). Prior to this, Letterston Junction was from Paddington via Rosebush. There is one tunnel, Spittal Tunnel, which is long; the eastern end is from Paddington. There were no intermediate stations at first, but three were opened later: on 1 October 1913, on 5 May 1924, and on 1 August 1923. The intermediate stations were closed on 6 April 1964, but the line remains open for services to Fishguard & Goodwick and Fishguard Harbour stations. Falling traffic on the line caused it to be reduced to single-track on 16 May 1971 with a passing loop at Letterston Junction.

Etymology The name Roodklooster, Rooklooster, or Rouge-Clo√Ætre comes from Roode Cluse (or kluizenarij) which according to some means the Red Hermitage. According to this theory, the walls of the original hermitage were coated in crushed tiles, which produced the characteristic red colour. It was then natural for the name to continue in use after the foundation became a priory (Rouge-Cloitre). Another (more scientific) explanation is the location in an open spot in the forest, a 'ro' or 'rode' (Compare Rolduc). Its official name in French is Saint-Paul en Soignes. History Foundation A hermitage was built in 1366 by a priest called Gilles Olivier and a layman called Walter van der Molen. William Daniel, a priest of the parish of Boendael, also celebrated Mass there from time to time. The founding charter was witnessed by Joanna, Duchess of Brabant, on March 1, 1367. Shortly after, some time between 1367 and 1369 and following the example of the nearby Groenendael_Priory, the community adopted the Rule of St. Augustine. The foundation was confirmed in 1373 by G√©rard de Dainville, Bishop of Cambrai and the following year was affiliated to the order of Chanoines r√©guliers de saint Augustin (Canons Regular of St. Augustine). The community grew quickly. In 1381, construction of the church was initiated, after receiving gifts of land and lakes from the Duchess of Brabant, as well as privileges and tax exemptions. Development In 1402, along with other Brabant priories, Rouge-Clo√Ætre formed a congregation (or General Chapter) which was led by Groenendael. In 1412, as part of the Groenendael congregation, the abbey joined the Windesheim congregation. These first centuries of the priory were ones of great devotion. It possessed a fine library and developed a notable illumination workshop. The location of the monastery provided easy access to the sandstone necessary for construction and wood from the forest was used for furniture and heating. Springs are plentiful in the area, the ponds supplied fish, and a water mill on the stream was used to grind grain and press oil. Part of the forest was cleared to provide cattle pasture. In 1400, an enclosure was created which partly survives today. The white sandstone church is decorated with paintings from Rubens' studio and in the 16th century, the monastery was one of the most prestigious in the Spanish Netherlands, in large part due to its proximity to Brussels. Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Isabella of Spain all stayed there, as well as many other notable personages. At the end of the 16th century, during the Dutch Revolt, the priory was pillaged and the canons were forced to take refuge in Brussels until the uprising was over.

The fire occurred around 5:30 am and spread rapidly through the building's wooden interior, trapping many of the hotel's 215 guests in their rooms and forcing them to escape via fire ladders or life nets. In addition to the fatalities, 42 more people, including fourteen firemen, were injured in the fire, which was thought to have been caused by a carelessly discarded cigarette. History of the Kerns Hotel The Kerns Hotel was located in the 100 block of N. Grand Ave. in Lansing, Michigan. It was built in 1909 by William G. Kerns as a four-story, 162-room hotel, constructed of brick with a wooden interior. The hotel cost $50,000 to build and was the first hotel in the state of Michigan to have running ice water in all of its rooms. By 1934, the total number of rooms had been increased to 211. State legislators and community groups often stayed at the hotel because of its location and amenities, including a popular bar and restaurant. Fire A plaque in downtown Lansing commemorating the fire On December 11, 1934, a fire broke out in the Kerns Hotel killing 32 people and injuring 44, including 14 firemen. The alarm bell sounded at 5:30 am in the 211-room four-story brick hotel. Many guests escaped by utilizing one of the four fire ladders or utilized the life nets, but due to the wooden interior many guests were trapped in their rooms. Two of the injured people died later, bringing the death toll to 34.  Victims  Among the dead were seven Michigan state legislators, state senator John Leidlein and state representatives T. Henry Howlett, Charles D. Parker, Vern Voorhees, John W. Goodwine, Don E. Sias, and D. Knox Hanna, who were in town for a special session of the Michigan legislature. A number of other legislators were injured but survived, including Maurice E. Post, Charles T. Kimball, and John Dykstra. Many of the hotel's 215 guests at the time escaped by the four fire ladders provided by the fire services, and eight people leapt out of the hotel onto nets. Aftermath Firefighters and evacuated guests were aided by the Lansing and Michigan State Police, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Volunteers of America and private citizens with clothing and food, as well as monetary support. There are two historical markers in Michigan dedicated to the event and the responders. The fire was widely covered by media, including appearing as the front page lead story in The New York Times and in the Illustrated London News. A memorial song, \\"The Lansing Hotel Fire\\", was written and published in 1935 by Walter Coon of Royal Oak, Michigan.

Located at the foot of city's central Cherepanova Hill in Pechersk Raion it was built following the Russian Civil War in 1923 after Kyiv was finally secured by the Red Army. Red Stadium The predecessor of the contemporary National Arena was the Kyiv City Stadium, which with the establishment of Soviet power was eventually renamed and better known as the Red Stadium. The construction of that stadium in Kyiv was considered as early as 1914, when the city was the commercial and cultural center of the Russian Empire's Southwest, and the Empire's third most important city (in some perspectives). The plans were shelved during World War I. In the following years, the city was in turmoil as the wars, revolutions, forces of different states and stateless bands occupied and fought in the city. The Bolshevik government revived the idea as the proposed Red Stadium in 1919, but the resumption of hostilities ended the project prematurely. Chaos gave way to stability in the early 1920s, with the capital of the Soviet Ukraine re-established in Kharkov (1919) and Kyiv having the status of guberniya center. Construction resumed under the leadership of engineer L. I. Pilvinsky in early 1923, to host the Second All-Ukrainian Spartakiad to be held in August of that year. The chosen site was the former location of the 1913 All-Russian exhibition‚Äîthe war-ravaged lot of the Oleksiivsky Park. The southern and eastern stands used the slopes of Cherepanov Mount, while the northern and western stands were constructed from the parts of damaged and adjacently located buildings. The football field size was 120x70, orienting west to east. The military commissar of the Kyiv Governorate Laiozs Gavro sponsored the construction project. The games were opened at the Trotsky Red Stadium on August 12, 1923 (by 1924 the name of Trotsky was omitted). The stadium became the main sports arena in the region and the home ground of FC Lokomotyv Kyiv (Zheldor Kiev).  Republican level of renovation  Many mistakes were made due to the rushed construction. In particular, the stadium was aligned along an east-west axis instead of the standard north-south. So in 1934 as the Republican administration was moved to Kyiv (from Kharkiv), the plans were made for the replacement of the stadium, and in 1936 construction began on the new 50,000-seat stadium designed by architect Mykhailo Hrechyna (1902‚Äì1979) called the Ukrainian Republican Stadium. Later Hrechyna organized all the renovations of the stadium until the 1980s. Among other Hrechyna's notable projects were Palace of Sports (located in the vicinity), Komsomolsky residential massif at the Dnipro Raion, Hotel \\"Rus\\", a building of the Trade- Industrial Chamber, as well as the hotel \\"Tarasova Hora\\" in Kaniv. The construction started on grounds adjacent to the Red Stadium. By Hrechyna's design the stadium was to be one of the best after the Moscow and Leningrad stadiums. The entrance to the stadium was beautified by the Corinthian Order colonnade of 22 columns. However, due to the lack of funding the construction of the colonnade was suspended and never finished. The complex was scheduled for completion in 1941 (see Five-Year Plan) and the ceremonial opening was scheduled for June 22, 1941. It was decided to name the stadium in honor of the first secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Nikita Khrushchev. A game fixture of the Soviet Top League was scheduled on the opening day between Dynamo Kyiv and Red Army team. However, in a monumental twist of history, on that very day Kyiv was bombed by the Luftwaffe as part of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the onset of the Great Patriotic War. The opening ceremony was not canceled, however: a sign hung on the stadium gates optimistically indicated that it was merely \\"postponed until after the victory\\". Indeed, following the 1945 Soviet Victory over Nazi Germany, not only was the stadium reconstructed, but tickets issued in 1941 were honored for admittance to an opening ceremony of the Respublikanskiy (Republican) Stadium in 1944. Wartime During the war all events at the stadium were suspended as the front line moved across and away from the city. With the military actions moving farther east, life in Kyiv was more or less stabilized. During that time the stadium was unofficially called the Sport Palace Stadium. On July 12, 1942 the stadium was officially reopened as the All-Ukrainian Stadium.History of the stadium After the liberation of Kyiv on November 6, 1943 retreating German troops damaged the stadium and some of its features were removed. It needed a major renovation which was undertaken by Khrestchatykbud (later - Kievcitybud-4). With the help of Kyiv residents the stadium conditions were returned to order in half a year.  After the war  The stadium was re- opened on June 25, 1944. Symbolically, the first game was between Dynamo Kyiv and CDKA Moscow, the same one that was to have taken place three years before. The Kyivan club was defeated 0:4, however it did not kill the celebratory mood of the event. Here is how the local newspapers were describing it: The government of the republic and Khrushchev personally requested the architects and builders to bring the stadium to its prewar condition as well as provide it with the latest improvements. Firstly, they were to install what was previously intended but not completed, such as the VIP stand, the sports pavilion with a colonnade, fence, etc. Secondly, floodlights to conduct football games in the evening hours as well as a contemporary scoreboard were to be installed. However, the scoreboard was not installed until 1949 and the match results were displayed on plates that were hung on poles with ladders and were changed by the stadium servicemen as the game went on. Improvements to the stadium were slowing down due to lack of investment and reconstruction stretched for five years until 1949. In the early 1950s a wooden scoreboard finally appeared over the stands of the southern goalpost. The names of teams and the score were depicted in meter-size letters on a 6x3 meters plywood shield, in a metal frame. After every scored goal a stadium serviceman would climb to the top by a special ladder and change the plates on the scoreboard. In the summer of 1954 the construction of the stadium main facade, the colonnade with a service entrance to the inside court of an administrative building, was finalized. Those columns became the distinguished landmark of the stadium. Further improvements The main achievement of that time was the installation in 1956 of four 45-meter metal towers with 320 spotlights having a total brightness of 500 lux. Also in 1956 a more contemporary scoreboard was installed. It had a clock in the middle and was equipped with electric lamps that displayed match results electronically. In October 1962 the stadium changed its name to the Central Stadium. It was at that time that the old scoreboard was replaced with a new electronic one which was bought in Hungary. On April 10, 1963 at the game Dynamo Kyiv - Spartak Moscow, spectators could for the first time see the scoreboard display the score and specifying the time when the goals were scored and the names of their authors. As the city boomed in the postwar years and its population approached two million, the stadium underwent its second major reconstruction in the mid-1960s. The renovations were planned to be completed prior to the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution (1967). In 1966‚Äì68 the Kyiv Central Stadium was enlarged to accommodate some 100,000 spectators with the addition of a second tier of seating. The design of the reconstruction was by the architects of Kyivan zonal scientific-research institute of typical and experimental planning and Kievproject headed by Mykhailo Hrechyna. The mounting of the second tier on the original double-console crossbars of reinforced concrete was considered to be the avant-garde practice in stadium construction across the globe. The expanded complex also included indoor tennis courts, two additional football pitches, several outdoor courts and other arenas, and notably a ski jumping ramp of a rather novel suspended design. During that reconstruction the scoreboard was replaced by two new ones measuring 18x6 meters. One displayed the time, date, and temperature, and the other the names of the teams, the game score and names of the goalscorers. Also, a news reporting complex was built. Over the upper tier of the western stand on tall supports several cabins were mounted for commentators. Olympic preparations The new stadium served the city until 1978, when it underwent a new cycle of complete reconstruction to accommodate the 1980 Summer Olympics which were hosted by the Soviet Union. It was renamed, yet again, as the Republican Stadium, a name that would remain for several years after the Collapse of the Soviet Union. It hosted the local ceremony of the Grand Opening of the 1980 Olympics followed by several football matches (the final games were held in the official host city, Moscow).1980 Summer Olympics official report.

The stadium continued to be the home ground of Dynamo with the Lobanovsky stadium serving as a training ground. Some time after 1998 big changes took place as the stadium was not being efficiently maintained. Dynamo decided to reconstruct Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium to become its primary ground due to the fact that attendance rarely exceeded 10,000 spectators. Since that time Olympic is used primarily for football international matches and is being lent to FC Dynamo Kyiv for high-profile home games when a high turnout is expected. However, it is not the official home ground of Dynamo or any other Kyiv club, as they all have smaller home stadiums and training bases. The stadium is an official home ground of the Ukraine national football team and was the official venue of the Ukrainian Cup final until 2008. Since 2008, Olympic is under major reconstruction in preparation for the continental championship.

The capacity of the stadium after this reconstruction would be 69,004. On 1 December 2008, reconstruction began when a winner of countless tenders held was announced. The stadium was reopened on 9 October 2011 with a performance by Shakira and had its international football inauguration with a friendly game between Ukraine and Germany on 11 November 2011.

It was built to commemorate the city's reconstruction after the 1755 earthquake. It has six columns (some 11 m high) and is adorned with statues of various historical figures. Significant height from the arch crown to the cornice imparts an appearance of heaviness to the structure. The associated space is filled with the coat of arms of Portugal. The allegorical group at the top, made by French sculptor C√©lestin Anatole Calmels, represents Glory rewarding Valor and Genius. Originally designed as a bell tower, the building was ultimately transformed into an elaborate arch after more than a century. Features Because of the top cornice's great height (over ), the figures above it had to be made colossal. The female allegory of Glory, which is dressed in peplos and measures , stands on a three-step throne and holds two crowns. Valor is personified by an amazon, partially covered with chlamys and wearing a high-crested helmet with dragon patterns, which were the symbols of the House of Braganza. her left hand holds the parazonium, with a trophy of flags behind. The Genius encompasses a statue of Jupiter behind his left arm. At his left side are the attributes of writing and arts. The four statues over the columns, made by Victor Bastos, represent Nuno Alvares Pereira and Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal on the right, and Vasco da Gama and Viriatus on the left.

As a growing boy, he enjoyed listening to many of the American popular songs, as well as the ever-popular Beatles. At age twelve, his mother, noting his keen interest in music, ...\\" Born in 1952 in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay, Perera was barely 12 years old when his mother enrolled him in a music conservatory where he selected the rare 36-string Paraguayan harp. Perera's complex technique includes precisely bending the strings to create sharps and flats while gliding across the harp in a seemingly effortless fashion, which bespeaks the tremendous amount of skill and discipline required. About the time Perera started playing the harp, the Beatles were in their heyday. The young musician absorbed their music as well as other pop music influences into his musical muse, which included Brazilian music, folk and tango from South America, and the folk music from Paraguay. Unable to find an instructor who could teach him how to perform a pop music repertoire on the harp, he experimented until he was able to overcome the instrument's technical hurdles and develop his own form of expression. In 1973, after completing ten years of harp studies in Montevideo, Perera moved to New York City with hopes of pursuing a top-notch music career. At first, his experience was not the American dream he had imagined, as his performances were limited primarily to playing folk tunes at clubs and restaurants. Perera paid his dues in New York for a couple of years before he was recruited by a talent scout to entertain at an exclusive private club in Florida. There he finally was allowed to perform his own compositions and further develop his distinctive style, having applied the musical influences of Weather Report and Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim. He'd starting approaching the harp as a percussive instrument, much like a piano, instead of a string instrument. By the time his recording debut, Erotica, was released by Epic Records in 1990, Perera had earned a reputation as one of the pioneers in electro- acoustic harp performance. His five albums for Heads Up infused the jazz-pop idiom with a wide range of multicultural flavorings, punctuated with guest performances by Trinidadian steel drummer Othello Molineaux, Nicaraguan salsa singer Luis Enrique, Floridian hand percussionist Robert Thomas Jr., and Cuban jazz reedman Paquito D'Rivera. In 1993 he won the Billboard Contemporary Latin Jazz Album of the Year award for his second Heads Up album, Dreams & Desires. He was selected musical director for the Hispanic Heritage Awards at the Kennedy Center in 1997 and 1998 was voted Favorite Jazz Artist in his category numerous times in the annual Jazziz magazine reader's poll. He guested on numerous recordings including D'Rivera's 100 Years of Latin Love Songs and Gloria Estefan's Abriendo Puertas. Perera's own compositions for In the Mood include \\"Joia\\" and \\"Six A.M.\\" A different approach is taken on \\"Coming Home,\\" written by Perera in the style Paraguayan folk music but adapted to the contemporary jazz idiom for In the Mood.

Background Getxo, a wealthy seaside suburb near the city of Bilbao, has been the location of several ETA attacks during the Basque conflict, with most of the attacks being carried out in the Las Arenas neighbourhood, home to many businessmen and entrepreneurs. Three civil guards were killed in an ambush in Las Arenas in October 1978.Otro criminal atentado en Bilbao, La Vanguardia, 24 October 1978, p13 In 2000, a car bomb injured seven on June 25, and four people were wounded in another car bomb attack on July 24. On January 22, 2001, Ertzaintza members deactivated a car bomb and judge Jose Maria Lid√≥n Corbi was shot dead on November 7. On April 20, 2002, a car bomb exploded in front of the house of a businessman, who had been kidnapped in 1996. A bomb exploded inside a hotel on June 23, 2003, while another car bomb went off on January 18, 2005, injuring one. On November 11, 2007, two booby trap bombs failed to explode in front of a courthouse. The same boat club had already been attacked by bombs on March 12, 1969, and on December 30, 1971. On November 26, 1973, six ETA members set fire to the club. 2008 was ETA's deadliest year since the end of the 2006 ceasefire. In mid 2006, the organisation declared a ceasefire, and conversations between Batasuna, ETA and the Basque and Spanish governments started. Peace talks ended in December, when ETA broke the truce with a massive car bomb at Madrid-Barajas Airport. ETA officially ended the ceasefire in 2007, and resumed its attacks around Spain. At the same time, dozens of members were arrested by Spanish and French police. Despite that, the organisation did not lose the capacity for carrying out attacks. Attack The vehicle, a Citro√´n Berlingo, the same model used in the Legutiano attack, was stolen in Getxo on the same morning of the attack by a cell formed by Arkaitz Goikoetxea Basabe and fellow ETA member Aitor Artetxe Rodr√≠guez. The car was the property of a company owned by a former member of ETA, Xabier Izko de la Iglesia, who had been sentenced in the 1970 Burgos trial. The car was then loaded with 60 kg of ammonal, a type of explosive usually used by ETA. The car also contained shrapnel shell in order to increase the destructive power. The explosive device had been obtained in the town of Ezcaray, La Rioja and was similar to an abandoned bomb found in Getxo on January 31, 2008. Austrian Consulate in Getxo was damaged by the explosion At 23:55, Goikoetxea phoned the DYA headquarters, a Basque roadside assistance association, in Bilbao on behalf of ETA, to alert them that a car bomb would go off in Getxo: \\"Listen carefully, I'm calling on behalf of ETA. In one hour, a van bomb is going to explode in the seafront walk, next to the boat club of Getxo. Do you understand? Freedom for the Basque Country. Long live ETA\\". According to reports, the warning call was made from a telephone box located 500 meters from the boat club. A few minutes later, a worker from the club spotted two hooded people, abandoning a vehicle in the middle of the road. Once Ertzaintza officers spotted the vehicle, the area was cordoned off and people evacuated from nearby houses. A family reported to have not been warned of the detonation. At 00:50, ten minutes before the time the caller had given, the device went off. The detonation tore a hole in the ground and caused considerable damage to the club. Several floors of the building were ripped open and it suffered serious structural damage. Nearby houses and buildings were also affected by the explosion, which was heard in most of the towns around the Estuary of Bilbao. According to the Spanish High Court, 114 people were affected in some way by the attack. After the attack, Ertzaintza kept the area cordoned off, while looking for other possible bombs. Meanwhile, Goikoetxea headed to Leioa and met Artetxe in a nearby mountain, where they would stay the whole night. By the morning, no other devices had been found and people were able to return to their homes. Aftermath Many authorities and politicians condemned the attack. Basque Nationalist Party president √ç√±igo Urkullu stated that \\"once again ETA tried to unreasonably become the judge of the Spanish politics\\" and Partido Popular president Mariano Rajoy gave his support to the government of Spain in its fight against ETA. Most of the political parties also condemned the attack, with Aralar stating that \\"ETA is an obstacle towards the peace that Euskal Herria (Basque Country) demands\\". Arrest On July 22, 2008, the Civil Guard dismantled the Biscay cell, with the arrest of nine members of ETA, including Goikoetxea. Most of the arrests were made in Bilbao, Getxo and Elorrio, while two other people were held in Fuengirola, M√°laga and in Nigran, Pontevedra.The operation, which was led by judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, also ended with the arrest of Gaizka Jare√±o Ugarriza, Adur Aristegi Aragon, I√±igo Gutierrez, Aitor Kotano Sinde, Libe Agirre Mazaga, Maialen Zuazo y Ana Isabel Prieto Fundarena. Senior members of the cell, such as Jurdan Martitegi or Asier Borrero were not arrested. The cell was going to carry out another car bomb attack in Getxo on July 31 and had plans to attack the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, as well as judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska. Aitor Artetxe was another cell member on the run until he was arrested in the French town of Gerde, Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es on December 8, 2008. On the same operation, head of the military commandos Aitzol Iriondo was also arrested, as well as another senior member of ETA, Eneko Zarrabeitia Salterain. On August 19, 2009, judge Santiago Pedraz prosecuted Goikoetxea and Artetxe for the attack.

The game was first released in South Korea, and an English version was scheduled to be released in December 2010 by WeMade Entertainment (the company responsible for the English Version of Digimon Battle), but it was delayed to 2011. It was announced in July 2011 that Joymax, a subsidiary of WeMade Entertainment, would publish the English version of the game. On August 30, 2011, Joymax held a pre-CBT for players, which ended on September 6, 2011. After the conclusion of the pre-CBT, Joymax announced on September 22, 2011 that the OBT will held on September 27. The OBT for Digimon Masters concluded on October 11, 2011 with the game going into commercial service globally on October 20, 2011, except for some countries. Background Digital World In the Digimon franchise, the Digital World is the virtual space built from Earth's communication networks where Digimon inhabit. Lands and islands were created as projects intended to make Digimon become closer to living things. As a result, the Digital World was formed. This Digital World exists inside the host computer called King Drasil and is under control of Artificial Intelligence. Digimon are a like-a-life organism with independent intelligence. They grow in a way similar to real organisms. They go through an evolution process that makes them stronger and more resilient. The Digital World is a parallel universe to the Real World where humans live. As the Digital World grows bigger and more powerful, transporting to the Real World becomes possible. Growth and evolution All Digimon are born from Digi-Eggs, and evolve and grow through a process called Digivolution. Digimon grow by hunting other Digimon and loading (absorbing) data from them. They prepare themselves to digivolve into the next digivolution type when they reach a certain level. Some Digimon established friendly relations with humans as their Partner and can digivolve through mortal power. In this case, the human is called a Tamer and the Digimon a Partner Digimon. Gameplay Players control an avatar of one of the four main Tamers of Digimon Data Squad: Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino Fujieda, and Keenan Crier. The avatar is not meant to represent the actual Tamer, and thus players can choose their own name and modify the appearance of the Avatar. After selecting a Tamer, players are then able to select a Partner Digimon. The Partner Digimon will be used in battle to accomplish NPC-given missions. The player may also hatch new Mercenary Digimon from DigiEggs dropped by enemy Digimon. Over the course of the game, Partner and Mercenary Digimon will Digivolve into stronger forms (some of which may require special items or quests to unlock) and learn new skills. Mercenary System This system allows the player to get Digimon which are not Partner Digimon. The player must hatch the Mercenary Digi-egg using an incubator along with the right type of DATA (chips) items. Mercenary Digi-eggs and data items can be acquired through game play (after defeating enemy Digimon) or purchased in the cash shop. The player can hatch the Mercenary Digimon after injecting DATA three times successfully: each time represents one stage of development. The player may inject additional DATA until the fourth or fifth stage. The higher the stage, the bigger the Digimon. However, the Mercenary Digi-egg may break after one or several attempts past the third stage. The alternate way to hatch a Mercenary Digi-egg is to buy it from the cash shop. The Mercenary Digi-egg bought from the cash shop has a 100% rate of success for at least 3 bars. Battle System Battling is done in real-time. The player's Digimon has a health bar measuring health and a Digi-soul meter. The Digi-soul meter measures the energy of Digimon to use special attacks, and when empty the Digimon can only use standard attacks. While in combat Tamers are able to use items that restore health and Digi-soul but must wait several seconds before being able to do so again. Unlike Digimon Battle combat takes place in real time with nearby players able to watch and even join in on battles. Digivolution All Digimon have an digivolution tree. After they level up, users can complete quests to begin digivolution. If users complete quests or reach the digivolution limit, the digivolution tree will automatically be available. When the digivolution tree is available, users can develop their Digimon by using a Tamer's DNA Charge. There are 11 types of crests and Digi- Eggs (Armor type), but only 10 types are used in the game. Each crest matches each Digi-Egg. Crests are used to open the digivolution tree. After combining certain elements, an entity of its digivolution tree is available. Each Digi- Egg has a different quantity of DNA and a certain amount of DNA is consumed when it Digivolves. As a result, digivolution to a higher level requires more DNA. Probability Item System The newest addition to the game which requires Rare coins bought from cash shop or just plain cash for crowns is the new probability box item system.https://dmo.gameking.com/Itemmall/Probability.aspx?subcate=4 These boxes have very rare pieces required to unlock more powerful jogress level digivolutions such as X-evolutions (i.e. OmegamonX). Although released in events inside these boxes, as of late, the events around these boxes have been under controversy due to requiring the person to spend the most real life money to win the rarest item from the event which is usually the item they want anyway. This same probability system was first used as an in game event system which did not require a player to spend any real currency just in game items or currency but has recently gone to the cash shop and seems to be here to stay.

The grape was officially register for use in wine production in 1982 and today is used to make a wide assortment of wines from dry varietals to sweet dessert wines.

Viticulturists L√°szl√≥ Bereznai and J√≥zsef Csizmazia crossed the Slovenia wine grape Bouvier (believed to be an offspring of the Pinot grape) with Eger 2 (a selfling of Villard blanc). The grape was originally named Egri Csillagok 40 meaning \\"star of Eger\\" with 40 being a breeding code but was officially registered under the name Bianca when it was authorized for wine production in 1982. In Serbia, Bianca was crossed with Petra to create two different pink-berried wine grape varieties, Baƒçka and Rubinka, which have been authorized for use in wine production since 2002. Viticulture Bianca grapes pre-veraison. Bianca is an early to mid budding grape variety that is known for its winter hardiness and resistance to the viticultural hazards of spring time frost damage. The vine is an early ripening variety which makes suitable for cultivation in wine regions with harsh continental climates and short growing seasons. The grape clusters of Bianca tend to be medium-sized to very large but the berries tend always be small in size with a noticeable waxy coating. The grapevine has strong resistance to many fungal diseases that can infect grapevines which has contributed to Bianca's popularity among organic vine growers. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing a large leafy canopy that needs to be kept in check with canopy management techniques, and high yielding. Among the viticultural hazards that Bianca is susceptible to is coulure which can be brought about due to poor weather conditions during flowering.

In Moldova, there were of Bianca being used in wine production as of 2012. Styles Varietal wine made from Bianca (center). According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Bianca tends to produce relatively neutral tasting wines that have moderate alcohol levels and can have some floral aromatics. The styles of wines made from Bianca are highly influenced by harvest time decisions with earlier harvested grapes tending to produce wines with what Robinson describes as more \\"exotic\\" aromas. In the winery, the wine made from Bianca is highly prone to oxidation with care needing to be taken to avoid the development of wine faults.

The PC version was released on March 25, 1998 in North America, and in 1998 in Europe. Story Gameplay Shadow Master gameplay. The game is a first person shooter, with multiple on screen enemies and extensive HUD information. Shadow Master is a first-person shooter, set in a science fiction universe. The player takes control of a futuristic and heavily armed ATV to traverse each level, combat aliens, and complete level objectives. Before each mission, the player is briefed by 'strategic command' on their mission objectives.Game manual p.8 The player is then brought into the level, which they can explore. The vehicle the player uses is controlled with either the D-Pad and shoulder buttons, or the two analog sticks in the PlayStation version.Game manual p.6 In the PC version, the mouse and keyboard or joystick can be used for movement. The player's vehicle has a certain amount of health and shields. If these drop below zero, a game over results. A radar is displayed to show the relative positions of enemies to the player character. The vehicle is also armed with many weapons, such as lasers, cannons, machine guns, missiles, grenade launchers and rail guns. Some have unlimited ammunition but are limited by an overheat meter which prevents constant use of the weapon, while others have a limited supply of ammunition but are much more effective and not limited by overheating.Game manual p.9 The game contains sixteen levels spread across seven different worlds to explore. The levels are completed when all objectives in the current mission have been completed. Each level comes with its own complement of enemies, with many of them resembling creatures from Earth such as apes or wasps, but are mechanoid instead of living organisms.Game manual p.11 There are also many alien creatures to contend with as well, with some henchmen being made in the image of the Shadow Master himself. The creatures drop items the player can use when they are destroyed, such as health crystals, ammunition, weapons, power-ups and upgrades. These dropped items stay active for a short period and disappear if not picked up.Game manual p.10 The PC version of Shadow Master also includes multiplayer support, using both IPX and serial connection. Development Shadow Master was developed by Hammersmith, a newly-formed company founded by Chris Stanforth, formerly of Traveller's Tales. The visual design concepts for the game were done by Rodney Matthews. Reception Shadow Master received mixed reviews from critics, with the PlayStation version getting higher scores overall. GameRankings has listed both the PlayStation version and PC version, with aggregate scores of 65.6% (PS) and 58.5% (PC). GameSpot gave the PlayStation version of the game a 7.2 out of 10 'Good' rating, stating that \\"Hackneyed plot aside, this game is actually pretty decent for a 3D shooter.\\" praising its visuals, especially its art direction stating \\"The resulting landscapes and creatures differ from anything you've seen before.\\", and the sheer number of enemies. IGN gave the game a lower score of 4 out of 10, citing the game's controls to be \\"sloppy\\", saying that \\"...piloting your vehicle is ugly. If that's not disheartening, try aiming at a gun turret behind a wall and getting stuck in a corner.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that \\"Is this playable? Yes. Desirable? No. Everything about Shadow Master screams 'second rate.' Pass on it and wait for the Psygnosis 'A' team to publish its next title.\\" The PC version of the game garnered harsher scores, with GameSpot giving the version a lower 4.7 out of 10 'Poor' rating, giving praise to the same areas as the PlayStation version, but cited issues with the multiplayer portion of the game, noting that \\"Our Righteous 3D machine chugged along at an unplayable pace, even with low- resolution, flat-shaded graphics enabled.

He was the senior civil servant in the Ministry of Justice for much of the 1920s and early 1930s, during the Weimar Republic era. Jo√´l also served as acting Minister of Justice and in 1931/32 was a member of Heinrich Br√ºning's second cabinet. Early life Curt Walter Jo√´l was born on 18 January 1865 at Greiffenberg, Silesia, in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia. His father, Hermann (1827-80), was a lawyer and notary there (later at Bromberg) and came from a family of Jewish merchants from Danzig. Curt Jo√´l's mother was Else (n√©e Pollack, 1843-90), also from a family of Jewish merchants. After her husband's death, she married Theodor R√∂mpler in 1883, founder and head physician at the family-owned Sanatorium G√∂rbersdorf (Waldenburg, Silesia). Curt's siblings included Eugen (1863‚Äì1911), Dr. med. and after 1902 head of the Sanatorium G√∂rbersdorf, Arthur (b. 1866), textile merchant and manufacturer at New York, and Walter (1867‚Äì1947), president of a Finanzgericht (financial court). His cousin (1856‚Äì1916) was founder and long- serving president of Banca Commerciale Italiana. Curt Jo√´l married Vally von Dressler (1880-1968) at Breslau in 1899. They had a daughter and a son, . Early career He studied law at Jena, Freiburg im Breisgau and Berlin. From 1899, he was a prosecutor at Landgerichte in Hanover and Berlin, 1903‚Äì06 at the Kammergericht and 1906-08 judicial aide at the ' at Leipzig. In 1908, he was promoted to Geheimer Regierungsrat and Vortragender Rat at the Reichsjustizamt (Imperial Ministry of Justice). At the outbreak of World War I, Jo√´l served as Landwehroffizier at the counterintelligence department of the Stellvertretender Generalstab in Berlin. From early 1915 until November 1917, he was a Hauptmann (captain), in charge of a department in occupied Belgium (known as the Generalgouvernement) and head of the Generalgouvernement's Zentralpolizeistelle (police headquarters). He also remained active in counterintelligence. In 1915, he fought determinedly, but unsuccessfully, against the execution of British citizen Edith Cavell, who had been found guilty of treason. In October 1917, he became a Direktor at the Reichsjustizamt and subsequently was named deputy Bundesratsbevollm√§chtigter of Prussia (representative in the Bundesrat). In early 1918, Jo√´l resumed work on a reform of criminal law he had previously worked on in 1908 (early draft) and since 1911 as a member of the Gro√üe Strafrechtskommission. Together with three co-workers he finished the reform draft in 1919. Career in the Weimar Republic By then, the Empire had been replaced with a republic but Jo√´l continued to work at the Reichsjustizministerium (Ministry of Justice) and in early 1920 became Unterstaatssekret√§r (under-secretary) and on 1 April 1920 Staatssekret√§r. During the Kapp-L√ºttwitz Putsch of March 1920, Jo√´l organised a conference of the ministerial under-secretaries and then went to Kapp to deliver their unanimous declaration against the putschists and in favour of the legitimate government. He competently and loyally served a total of eleven ministers and 15 cabinets, from a variety of political backgrounds. Never a member of any party himself, Jo√´l represented the unpolitical, technocratic civil servant. He worked to keep the ministry free of party politics, which contributed to the high esteem in which the ministry was held by other ministries, state governments and the parliament. During this time he served repeatedly as acting minister of justice, first in the cabinet of chancellor Wilhelm Marx. Jo√´l was particularly close to Gustav Radbruch, Kuno von Westarp, Heinrich Br√ºning and . However, in October 1931, at that point again acting minister since 1930, Jo√´l acceded to Br√ºning's request to become Minister of Justice in his second cabinet. The cabinet resigned in June 1932 and Jo√´l then refused the offer by Franz von Papen to join its successor, since he did not want to be a party to the planned lifting of the legal ban on Sturmabteilung and Schutzstaffel, which he had earlier co-signed into law. Jo√´l died on 15 April 1945 in Berlin.

Family As the seventh-born child in his family, Duke Constantine Petrovich was a junior member of a cadet branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp, a small ducal house based on Germany's border with Denmark. During the 18th Century, the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp gained influence through a carefully planned series of marital alliances with the royal houses of Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Prussia. The childless Empress Elizabeth of Russia proclaimed her nephew, Charles Peter Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp heir to the throne and when he became Tsar Peter III of Russia in 1762, the Holstein-Gottorps, themselves a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg, became the Imperial house of Russia, which they ruled until 1917 under the name of Romanov. Tsar Peter III of Russia married on 21 August 1745 to his second cousin, the Prussian princess Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, better known as Catherine II or Catherine the Great. The couple had one son, Paul, who, after the death of Empress Catherine in 1796, ruled as Emperor Paul I of Russia until his assassination in 1801. Paul and his wife, Maria Feodorovna, Duchess of W√ºrttemberg, had 10 children. Their eldest son ruled as Emperor Alexander I of Russia between 1801 and 1825, the period of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1808, when Oldenburg was overrun by French and Dutch troops, Peter I, the Grand Duke of Oldenburg and Prince-Bishop of L√ºbeck, sent his second-eldest son, Duke George of Oldenburg, to stay in Russia with his relatives, the Russian Imperial Family. On 3 August 1809, Duke George of Oldenburg, the grandfather of Duke Constantine Petrovich, married to Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna, daughter of Tsar Paul I. The marriage was arranged hastily, as a means of avoiding a forced marriage with Napoleon Bonaparte, but it turned out to be a happy match. Catherine Pavlovna was a favorite sister of Tsar Alexander I, and Duke George of Oldenburg became a favorite at court. They had two children. Their second son, Duke Peter Georgievich of Oldenburg, the father of Constantine Petrovich, was born in 1812. Early life Constantin of Oldenburg by Hau, 1853.

Peterhof - Front View Little has been written about the early life of Duke Constantine Petrovich. The record indicates he was baptised as a Protestant with the name Konstantin Friedrich Peter. But at court he was called by his Russian name and patronymic, Constantine Petrovich. He grew up in St. Petersburg during the 1850s. He had three brothers and four sisters.McIntosh, David.

George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg (1852‚Äì1912) Military career The Russo-Turkish War in Caucasia, 1877 From 1869 to his death in 1906, Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg was registered in the Life Guard's Preobrazhensky Regiment. During the Russo- Turkish War of 1877-78, the Preobrazhensky regiment distinguished itself in battle. Constantine Petrovich served as an adjutant stationed on the Caucasian Front in Georgia as part of the Russian Caucasus Corps under the overall command of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich, the Governor General of the Caucasus. Constantine Petrovich eventually rose to the rank of Lt. General of Kuban Cossacks.Ruvigny et Raineval, Melville H. The Titled Nobility of Europe. Harrison & Son, 1914, \\"Zarnekau\\" The Kuban Cossacks constituted 90 percent of the cavalry on the Caucasian front. These legendary horsemen won fame for numerous battles during the Russo-Turkish war, namely the Battles of Shipka Pass, the defense of Doƒüubeyazƒ±t, and the final and victorious Battle of Kars, a decisive Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire. Post War Years Mih√°ly Zichy. The Knight in the Panther's Skin. 9 At the end of the war, between 1881 and 1887, Constantine Petrovich commanded the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the Hopersky Kuban Cossacks, stationed near Kutaisi, a town in the Georgian province of Imeretia, just north of the battlefield at Kars. He most likely remained under the command of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich, who, as Governor General of the Caucasus, lived nearby in Tbilisi (then known as Tiflis). At this time, the Black Sea coast in Georgia became the \\"Riviera of Russia,\\" a popular place for wealthy Russians to visit on vacation, and the arts scene in Tiflis began to thrive. Constantine Petrovich became a guest at the social salon of Barbara Bonner Baratashvili (\\"Babale\\"), n√©e Princess Cholokashvili, whose mansion at 9 Reutov Street attracted many poets, painters and writers. It was here that Constantine Petrovich first saw the Imeretian noblewoman Agrippina Japaridze, his future wife. She was starring in the lead role of the play \\"The Knight in the Panther's Skin,\\" a production mounted by Princess Cholokashvili in order to raise funds for a monument to one of Georgia's greatest poets, Shota Rustaveli. Agrippina played Tinatin, an Arabian princess who sends her suitor on a quest to find a mysterious Knight in Panther's skin. The scenes and backdrops for the show were painted by the famous Hungarian court painter Mih√°ly Zichy, and the play was a tremendous success, winning \\"endless applause.\\" After the show, Constantine Petrovich began a reckless flirtation with Agrippina and his attentions to the wife of a fellow officer caused people to gossip. Agrippina's husband, Prince Tariel \\"Taia\\" Dadiani, was one of the officers under Duke Constantine's commandHarcave, Sidney, Trans. The Memoirs of Count Witte. New York: M.E. Sharp, 1990. Ch. IX Kiev in the 1880s, p. 79 It was considered very bad form to take advantage of one's rank in such a manner. The Dadiani were a highly respected noble family in Georgia, its principal branch being in possession of the Principality of Mingrelia. Agrippina was Tariel Dadiani's second wife, and she had already given him three children: Prince Mikel (b.1860), Prince Levan (b.1864) and Princess Nino Dadiani (b.1868). Tariel's first wife was Princess Sophia Shervashidze (1838-1859), who died giving birth to their only child Princess Margareta (b.1859). Both Tariel's daughters married their cousins, Dadiani Princes from another branch of the family. Margareta married Prince Prince Giorgi Niko Dadiani (b.1855) and Nino married Prince Aleksandri Niko Dadiani (b.1864). It is rumored that Constantine Petrovich finally won Agrippina from her husband while playing cards. The Duke allegedly agreed to cancel Dadiani's debts in exchange for his wife. When Prince Dadiani agreed, Agrippina left him. On June 28, 1882, Agrippina divorced Dadiani. According to the memoirs of Counte Witte, Constantine Petrovich \\"had to marry her after she divorced her husband.\\"Witte, p. 80 They wed that fall. Marriage and issue Constantine's morganatic wife Agrippina Japaridze, Countess von Zarnekau. On 20 October 1882, Constantine entered into a morganatic marriage with a Georgian noblewoman Agrippina Japaridze, divorced Princess Dadiani, described by one source as wealthy and an \\"exceedingly lovely girl\\". Grand Duke Peter II, head of the House of Oldenburg, created her Countess von Zarnekau on the day of their wedding, with the same title passing to their children. Between 1883 and 1892 they produced six children, all of them born in Kutais, the Caucasus: * Alexandra Constantinovna von Zarnekau, Countess von Zarnekau (10 May 1883 - 28 May 1957); married Prince George Alexandrovich Yurievsky, a son of Alexander II of Russia. * Ekaterina Konstantinovna von Zarnekau, Countess von Zarnekau (16 September 1884 - 24 December 1963) * Nikolai Konstantinovich von Zarnekau, Count von Zarnekau (7 May 1885 - 1976) * Aleksai Konstantinovich von Zarnekau, Count von Zarnekau (16 July 1887 - 16 September 1918) * Petr Konstantinovich von Zarnekau, Count von Zarnekau (26 May 1889 - 1 November 1961) * Nina Konstantinovna von Zarnekau, Countess von Zarnekau (13 August 1892 - 1922) Professional and business career After their marriage in 1882, the couple lived on the Japaridze family estate in Kutaisi. An able manager, Constantine Petrovich helped Agrippina to build her lands into productive vineyards and a winery. He established himself as a person interested in helping the region to develop its agriculture, especially the study of balneology and viticulture. In 1884, they bought a local wine cellar established by the Frenchman Shote in 1876 for bottling champagne. They developed this into a thriving business that sold sparkling wines. They also began an export company. Constantine Petrovich bought stock in local mines and oil wells, and began selling fruit, melons, vegetables and other farm goods abroad. In his capacity as a cavalry general, Constantine Petrovich oversaw the local stables, gradually becoming an expert horse-trader, providing services to Russian officers and aristocrats in the region. The record indicates Constantine Petrovich became a member of the Veterinary Council of the Russian Empire, and he eventually became the \\"director general of all the Imperial horse-breeding establishments.\\"Washington Post, 2 Feb 1917, p. 6 By the early 1890s, they were doing business in Odessa, Ukraine. Duke Constantine also made regular visits to Alexandrovsk (Zaporozhe), home of the Zaparozhian cossacks, in order to buy and sell horses. The Memoirs of Count Witte indicate that Duke Constantine and his family spent their vacations visiting with his sister, the Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna, at her summer palace in Kiev. Palaces in Petersburg and Tiflis Tiflis in the 1870s In November 1894, Tsar Alexander III became ill with nephritis and died. When Tsar Nicholas II acceded to the throne, he allowed Duke Constantine Petrovich and his family to return to St. Petersburg. Duke Constantine took a house at 36 Tavritcheskaia, next door to the building that later became the Tavricheskaya Art School in 1919.

In 1895, Duke Constantine also bought from Amelia Titel a palace on what was then called Garden Street in Tiflis. On this land, Titel had commissioned a famous architect, Karl Stern, to build a large luxury villa. Designed in the \\"Brick Gothic\\" style, the Duke of Oldenburg's Palace served as the family's main residence in the Caucasus for the next ten years. In 2009, it was renovated and became an Art Palace, the Georgian State Museum of Theatre, Music, Cinema and Choreography at 6 Kargareteli Street, Tbilisi. Controversial Wedding of Daughter George, Olga & Ekaterina Yurievski, the children of Tsar Alexander II of Russia Constantine Petrovich did not improve matters in the year 1900, when he celebrated the wedding of his 17-year-old daughter, Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau, to the Tsar's half-uncle, Prince George Alexandrovich Yuryevsky at Nice, France.\\"Not in Good Standing at Court\\" Washington Post, 2 Feb 1917, p. 6 Prince George \\"Gogo\\" Yurievsky was the son of Tsar Alexander II and his secret mistress, Catherine Dolgorukov, the Princess Yurievskaya. Catherine, her son and two daughters were disliked intensely by Tsar Alexander III, whose mother, the Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna had been hurt and dishonored when Tsar Alexander II took Catherine Dolgorukov as his mistress in July 1866.Alexandre Tarsaidze, Katia: Wife Before God, MacMillan (New York: 1970) p. 287 Because Catherine Dolgorukov urged the Tsar passionately to make liberal reforms, she was also greatly disliked by the political conservatives at court.Alex Butterworth, The World That Never Was, Vintage Books, New York, 2011, p. 146 After the death of Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna in June 1880, Tsar Alexander II married Catherine Dolgorukov, and made her three children legitimate. He gave each of them the new name Yurievsky and the rank of Prince or Princess. This caused a rumor at court that the Tsar wished for the newly legitimized Prince George Yourievsky to become the next Tsar, instead of his older and legitimate son, Alexander. When bomb-throwing anarchists killed Tsar Alexander II on 1 March 1881, Tsar Alexander III wasted no time in getting rid of the Yourievsky family. Together with her three children, Princess Catherine was removed from the royal palace, banned from participation in the funeral procession, and eventually banished from Russia. As the new Tsar, Alexander III swiftly rolled back many of the liberal reforms his father had made. Foreseeing this hostility, Tsar Alexander II had settled a large fortune on Princess Yurievsky‚Äî3.5 million rubles parked in Swiss bank accounts.Perry and Pleshakov, p. 31 When she had arrived in France, she was reported to be very wealthy and found herself immediately surrounded by a circle of sympathetic Russian √©migr√©s who hoped to receive her financial aid. During the next 20 years, the Yurievsky circle in Paris and Nice remained under the surveillance of the Russian secret service. The police reports indicate this group of wealthy Russian exiles and Georgian nationalists became involved in a number of secret plots. Connection to Assassination Plots In 1885, Baron Arthur von Mohrenheim, head of the Russian Okhrana (secret police) in Paris, reported to his replacement, Pyotr Rachkovsky, that the widowed Princess Yurievskaya had been using her money to finance a group of Russian nihilists who were attempting to kill Tsar Alexander III and his family. Rachkovsky dismissed the rumor as absurd.Alex Butterworth, The World That Never Was: A True Story of Dreamers, Schemers, Anarchists & Secret Agents, Vintage Books (New York: 2011), p. 183 However, the rumor gained traction when a young Georgian nationalist, Prince Viktor Nakachidze, was convicted in late 1885 for participating in a nihilist bomb plot to kill the Tsar.Nihilists arrested, The Church Weekly, 18 January 1901, p. 44, Col. 3 Through his Mingrelian relatives, Prince Victor Nakashidze had connections to Princess Agrippina Japaridze, the wife of Duke Constantine Petrovich, and to the Dadiani family -- Salome, Niko and Andria Dadiani‚Äîthe Georgian royal family then living in exile at Nice. For his role in the bomb plot, Prince Victor Nakachidze was sentenced to death and sent to Siberia. However, with the aid of his wife, Mlle. Roedel, he managed to escape, travelling across the Pacific to the United States. The couple eventually resurfaced in London.Marquise de Fontenoy, \\"Militant Princess without a Country,\\" Washington Post, 18 June 1911, p. 4 In 1890, Rachkovsky managed to entrap and convict Prince Victor Nakachidze and 26 of his associates as they prepared to set off bombs at the 1890 \\"Exposition Universelle\\" (World Fair) in Paris.Alex Butterworth, The World that Never Was, Vintage Books (New York: 2011) pp. 266-267 Once again, after serving only a few years in prison, Prince Nakachidze escaped. Peter Ivanovich Rachkovsky, head of the Tsar's secret police unit in Paris In 1896, Prince Viktor Nakachidze resurfaced in Italy, where he gave up making bombs and masterminded an attempt to kill Tsar Nicholas II with poison. Observing that the Tsar often wore dress gloves, Nakachidze's circle studied the history of the Borgias at a local library in Milan, learned how to make powerful poisons, and recruited an agent in the palace at St. Petersburg to replace the Tsar's dress gloves with poison-coated gloves. This murder attempt, reported in September 1896 by the international press, was very nearly successful. Doctors specializing in toxicology were summoned quickly to the palace and Tsar Nicholas made no public appearances for more than a week.\\"Nihilists Resort to Borgia's Art: Plot to Kill the Czar by Impregnating His Gloves with Poison Almost Succeeds,\\" [New York] World, 6 September 1896, p. 25, col. 5 Shortly after the marriage of Prince George Yurievsky to Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau at Nice in 1901, a connection between Prince Viktor Nakachidze and the Yurievsky circle in Nice became clear. Nakachidze was arrested in Nice by French police \\"who affirm that they have full proof that the Prince was engaged in a plot to assassinate the Russian Emperor should he visit the Riviera.\\"The Church Weekly, 18 January 1901, p. 44 Col. 3 The French jailed Nakachidze for two weeks, then released him. While attempting to rejoin his group in Milan, Prince Nakachidze was arrested again by Italian police at Rome. On this occasion he gave a brief interview to the press and claimed that he was not an anarchist, but a patriot and a Georgian nationalist. He said he had returned to France, despite a long-standing banishment, because he was homeless and in great need of financial help. Strangely, Prince Viktor Nakachidze claimed that he represented \\"a legitimate pretender to the Russian crown.\\"\\"Russian Prince Sentenced in Italy,\\" New York Times, 2 October 1901 The only person living in Nice, France, who could reasonably have made a legitimate claim to the Russian crown was Prince George Yurievsky. Tsar Nicholas II therefore had reason to look with suspicion on the marriage arranged in 1900 between the eldest daughter of Duke Constantine Petrovich and Prince George Yurievsky. Duke Constantine Petrovich appeared to be forging an alliance with the Yurievsky circle in Nice ‚Äî a group that had a potentially valid claim to the Russian crown, and a wealthy group that now appeared to be offering financial aid to Prince Viktor Nakachidze, a well-known Georgian assassin and bomb-maker. Death and Burial Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg died of cancer at Nice, France, on 18 March 1906.19 March 1906 New York Times Sources disagree on the place of his burial. He is reported either to have been buried in Nice, or to have been buried near his father's grave in the Coastal Monastery of St. Sergius, traditional burial ground of the Russian Dukes of Oldenburg and Leuchtenberg. The royal graves at the monastery are no longer in evidence‚Äîthey were either desecrated or lost during the Soviet period.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1861 to 1863. He married Sara Leititan Morris on 16 June 1829. One of their sons Western Wood was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council.  Family  Wood was the fourth child, and second son, of Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet (1768‚Äì1843) and his wife Maria n√©e Page. His father had been a Lord Mayor of London, and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 36 years. His brother William (1801‚Äì1881) was a barrister and Liberal MP who was ennobled as Lord Hatherley and became Lord Chancellor; his older brother John (1796‚Äì1866) was the father of Katharine O'Shea, whose divorce from her husband remarriage Charles Stuart Parnell became a major political scandal in 1890.  Career  Wood was a merchant in the City of London, and a member of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, of which he was a warden by 1861. When the Lord John Russell, the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the City of London, was elevated to the peerage as Earl Russell, Wood was chosen as the Liberal candidate for the resulting by- election. At the selection meeting in the London Tavern on 18 July, one person favoured inviting the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Ewart Gladstone, to be their candidate, but the others preferred Wood. He told the meeting that, like his father Sir Matthew and his brother Sir William, he supported the secret ballot. In an election address issued that evening he stated his selection was due \\"entirely to the favourable recollection of the services of my late father\\". He said that he had been a reformer since his youth, when those principles were not dominant, and pledged himself to support any measures to extend the franchise, expand education, and to achieve an \\"equitable adjustment of the vexed question of church-rates\\". In foreign policy, he pledged to follow the principles of Lord John Russell when Foreign Secretary, and said that while it was Britain's duty to express a \\"lively sympathy for the efforts of other nations to secure their civil and religious liberty\\", they should abstain \\"from all interfence with the development of the national will\\". He asserted that his own personal interests in the commercial of affairs of the city would ensure that he gave them due attention, and that his experience was that in business matters public and private interests were \\"identical\\". Finally, he asked the electors not to vote for him on any grounds other than that his opinions coincided with theirs. His Conservative opponent was the then Lord Mayor of London, William Cubitt, who had resigned as MP for Andover in order to contest the by-election. The election began as a personal contest between two prominent figures in the City, but developed into a vigorous contest of political principles. Nominations took place at a hustings in the London Guildhall on 29 July, with polling on 30 July 1861. When the result was formally declared on 31 July, Wood had won with a majority of 506 votes out of a total of 10,988. Cubitt had a significant lead amongst the city's Liverymen, but that was not enough to offset Wood's lead amongst the householders. Wood died in office less than two years later, on 17 May 1863, at his home North Crayplace in Kent. He had an inflammation of both lungs, accompanied by pleurisy.

In the same year, the death penalty was abolished for ordinary crimes. History Peru's final execution took place on January 20, 1979, when Julio Vargas Garayar, a 26-year-old Air Force sergeant, was shot by a firing squad for selling classified political information to Chile, who were then considered political enemies of Peru. Garayar was arrested on October 12, 1978, while trying to enter an air base in Talara; he was accused of attempting to enter the base to collect classified information from it. After a brief trial before a military tribunal, Garayar was convicted of the charges. He was formally ordered to pay 100,000 pesos and simultaneously sentenced to death on December 14, 1978; his appeal to the Supreme Council of Military Justice was rejected the day before his execution, and he was summarily stripped of his honors, dishonorably discharged, and executed at 6:00 AM. Some consider the execution to be controversial to this date; Garayar's daughter and other members of his surviving family claim that Peruvian officials forced a confession from Garayar by using torture. Later in 1979, Peru abolished the death penalty for crimes committed during peacetime, specifying via an amendment in their Constitution that such executions were therefore abolished. However, the Constitution did not abolish executions for six specific wartime crimes: treason, genocide, crimes against humanity, terrorism, war crimes, and murder. Current usage Capital punishment is currently legal only during times of international or civil war, with several restrictions. Death sentences and executions during this time are allowed for specific crimes, and may only be imposed by military courts during states of war. Executions are carried out by a firing squad and is still permitted for the same six specific crimes exempted from the Constitution's peacetime abolition. In spite of the abolition of peacetime capital punishment and the fact that the government has not carried out an official execution since 1979, there have still been some documented extrajudicial and unofficial executions, such as the Barrios Altos massacre in 1991 and the April 22, 1997, executions of paramilitary hostage-takers in Peru's Japanese embassy. Modern developments The Constitution of Peru allows for the reinstatement of the death penalty for peacetime terrorism. On November 11, 2006, President Alan Garc√≠a submitted a bill to the Peruvian Congress proposing that the death penalty be restored for terrorism during peacetime. On January 10, 2007, the Peruvian Congress rejected the bill. Earlier, in August 2006, President Garc√≠a proposed reintroducing the death penalty in Peru for rape and child murder, which attracted condemnation from human rights groups like the International Federation for Human Rights. The IFHR issued a statement later that month stating that reintroducing the death penalty in Peru would be \\"a setback for human rights.\\" The February 1, 2018, rape and murder of 11-year-old Jimena Vellaneda in Lima reignited the debate concerning the death penalty in Peru. A week after her murder, more than 4,000 Peruvian citizens participated in a march through Lima protesting her murder and calling for her murderer to receive harsh punishment.

A tiarna (Irish), or tighearna (Scottish), both from the Old Irish tigerna, is a lord in the Gaelic world and languages. An Ard Tiarna is a \\"high lord\\", approximately equal in rank to a count or earl, although many of such higher rank still happen to prefer the title on its own.A Glossary of European Noble, Princely, Royal, and Imperial Titles. by Mark Odegard, 1996. Tierney Is a modern version of the surname of 'Tiarna' even though spelt differently the meaning remains the same. In later Gaelic sources, for example the Annals of the Four Masters, the term has also been frequently used to replace the title R√≠ (king) in cases where the authors or current tradition no longer regarded earlier regional and local dynasts as proper kings, even when they are styled such in contemporary sources. Thus when encountered the term is not always to be trusted. In fact this was part of a wider change in the understanding of kingship in the later Middle Ages, and even a living or recently deceased r√≠ might find himself downgraded in certain sources.

Arriving in Oregon in 1849, he soon acquired a donation land claim. In 1858, he sold his steamship interests in Oregon and moved to British Columbia in Canada. His land claim, left to heirs, became the Irvington subdivision in 1887. Irving Street in Portland is also named for him. Park amenities include fields for baseball, softball, and soccer; courts for basketball, tennis, and volleyball; paved paths, picnic tables, a playground, a horseshoe pit, and an off-leash area for dogs.

He describes her as \\"a laughing, dappled shadow\\". \\"Ooh Po Pe Do Girl\\" was written by band member Jeff Hanna. This is a 12 bar blues.

It has a double vocal. Guitar and drum provide most of the music. Harmonica plays over the second half. \\"It's Raining Here in Long Beach\\" was written by Jackson Browne. It starts like a slow dirge with a Ringo like vocal. The second half speeds up like 20s popular song. The lyrics caution that while Long Beach can be fun, you can't afford to live there. Banjo is the dominant instrument. \\"I'll Search the Sky\\" has a funky riff behind the verses. The first verse is guitars, the second verse adds horns. The choruses and final verse include violin. The lyrics speak with regret and yearning for the \\"bird\\" who came, stayed for a while, but eventually flew off on her own. \\"Truly Right\\" was written by Michael Brewer and Tom Shipley, who recorded it themselves the next year for their first album 'Down in L. A.. They are best known for their 1970 top 10 hit \\"One Toke Over the Line\\". The music is acoustic guitars, banjo, drums, and tambourine, with two vocalist.

The songs starts with a guitar intro, which is repeated in the middle. The rest of the song choppy quarter notes on piano and drum. A trombone adds some accent notes. The lyrics are one long joke, I can't remember anything about you, but I can't forget you. \\"Call Again\\" was written by band member Bruce Kunkel. The song has a Ringo Starr vibe with drums up front. Guitar is accompanied by violin and flute. The lyric implore you to disregard the thoughtless thing he may have said or done, and please call again. \\"The Teddy Bear's Picnic\\" was written in the 1930s and has been recorded many times.

It was considered a branch synagogue. The new location in Potomac worked out; the congregation's membership increased by ten percent, and the religious school's enrollment increased ten-fold. In the late 1980s, Beth Sholom was principally responsible for the construction of a two-mile- long eruv in Potomac that made it permissible for observant Orthodox Jews to carry and push objects within the boundaries area on Shabbat, leading to the growth of the Orthodox population in the area. In order to accommodate its large community, the congregation constructed a new building on the Potomac site in 1994.Braun-Kenigsberg, Lisa. \\"Common Ground in an Uncommon Place: Middle-Class Orthodox Jews, Attracted by Synagogue, Are Flocking to Potomac.\\" The Washington Post.

It is currently the largest LGBT affirming Pentecostal organization in the World.  History  It was founded December 5, 2010 in Indianapolis, Indiana.http://www.myapci.org APCI was founded to be a non- legalistic Apostolic Pentecostal organization with racial equanimity not found in other similar types of organizations. APCI has established congregations in the US, Albania, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Portugal, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ecuador, Nigeria, Ghana, Argentina, South Africa, United Kingdom, Cuba and Guatemala, and is working toward establishing churches in Montenegro, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Madagascar, Taiwan and Trinidad. APCI also has extensive ministries in Nigeria, through their Chicago church, High Praises International Ministries. The church holds General Conference each year, usually in July. Leadership Bishop Erik D. Swope-Wise is the Presiding Bishop, and Bishop Alfredo Pena is Associate Bishop. Temporal authority, however, is vested in the General Board, which includes Bishop Jabowa Whitehead (Overseer General), Ref. Jessica Jackson (treasurer) and Rev. Kelsey Swope-Wise (General secretary). Beliefs In matters of doctrine, their beliefs are similar to those of most Pentecostal churches: the deity of Christ, water baptism by full immersion in the name of the father and the son and the Holy Spirit which is Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and holiness of life and heart. APCI adheres firmly to these teachings, and does not give ministerial credentials to those holding other beliefs. APCI is a fully affirming church open to all persons. Unlike most Pentecostal churches, APCI is LGBT-affirming. Their anti-discrimination policy includes numerous categories, including race, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Unlike most other Pentecostal churches, APCI does not believe that being homosexual, bisexual or transgender is sinful. They base this view on their understanding of the Hebrew and Greek texts of scripture, as do other LGBT Affirming Apostolic organizations. Newsletter APCI publishes a quarterly newsletter in PDF format, The Apostolic Voice, which is distributed free of charge via email and online.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 34 Oxford University Press 1996 History The name Brun Fourca comes from the colour of the stems brun (or brown) and the characteristic \\"forked\\" (fourche) shape of the clusters with shoulder or \\"wing\\" branch of the cluster being of pronounced size and length in contrast to the main bunch stem. The first written mention of Brun Fourca was in a 1772 document where the name was used as a synonym for Pinot noir. Proven√ßal records from 1783-1784 mention actual Brun Fourca planted in the communes of Aubagne and Aix-en-Provence in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 139-140, Allen Lane 2012 Viticulture Brun Fourca is a mid-ripening variety that is highly prone to powdery mildew and botrytis rot. The vine produces small \\"forked\\" clusters of very large berries that easily fall off the rachis when the grapes are fully ripe. Wine regions and AOC regulations An AOC Palette wine from Ch√¢teau Simone, one of the few wine estates that claim to still be growing Brun Fourca. While the grape was historically grown throughout the Provence, South West France and Languedoc wine regions, today it is nearly extinct with less than 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of the variety recorded in France in 2006. What is left is found almost entirely within the Palette AOC where two estates, Ch√¢teau Simone and Ch√¢teau Cr√©made, claim to still be using the grape in their red and ros√© blends with Cinsault, Grenache and Mourvedre. Brun Fourca has been historically confused with Pinot noir (pictured). Brun Fourca grapes destined for AOC wine production must be harvested to a yield no greater than 40 hl/ha with the finished wine attaining a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. In addition to Cinsault, Grenache and Mourvedre which must make up the majority of the wine, Brun Fourca can also be blended with Carignan, Castet, Manosquin, Muscat noir and Cabernet Sauvignon.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pp. 91 Firefly Books 2004 Confusion with other varieties Over the years plantings of Brun Fourca have been confused with other wine grape varieties due to either similarities in appearance of synonyms. These include the Burgundian wine grape Pinot noir, of which Brun Fourca was an 18th-century synonym, and the ancient Ard√®che variety Chichaud. Synonyms Among the synonyms that have been used to describe Brun Fourca and its wines include Brun d¬¥Auriol, Brun de Farnous, Brun Farnous, Brun Tourcae, Brun Tourcale, Brunfourka, Caula, Caula Noir, Caula noir de Vaucluse, Farnous (in the Var department), Floura, Flouron (in the Dr√¥me), Gros Taulier, Man√ßonnet (in Ard√®che), Morrastel Fleuri, Morrastel Flourat, Moulan (in H√©rault), Moulard, Moulau, Mourastel Flourat, Moureau (in Gard), Mourrastel Fleuri, Mourrastel-Flourat (in H√©rault), Morrastel Floura, Mouzeau (in Gard), Mulon, Plant de Bordeaux and Plant Francais.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Brun Fourca Accessed: March 24th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Brun Fourca"},{"id":"29937209","text":"Wilson Alcorro (born March 11, 1973 in Galapa, Colombia) is a professional Colombian boxer in the Light Welterweight division and is the former IBF Latino champion.http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=15696&cat;=boxer Pro career IBF Latino Championship In May 1996, Wilson knocked out undefeated Jud Franky Granada to win the IBF Latino championship.http://boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=47719 Soto vs. Alcorro On May 28, 2004 Alcorro lost by T.K.O. to WBC Featherweight champion Humberto Soto over twelve rounds.http://boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=396473 References External links * Category:Light-welterweight boxers Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Colombian male boxers ","title":"Wilson Alcorro"},{"id":"29937266","text":"Caula may refer to: People * Sigismondo Caula, Italian painter of the Baroque style * Victor Hugo Caula, 20th century Argentinian cinematographer Botany *Brun Fourca, red French wine grape variety that once grew widely throughout Provence and Southwest France *Counoise, a dark-skinned wine grape grown primarily in the Rh√¥ne valley region of France  See also  * Kaula (disambiguation) ","title":"Caula"},{"id":"29937354","text":"Rare Junk is the third album from The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, released in 1968.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Station-Albums/KRLA/KRLA- Beat-1968-05.pdf In an attempt to update their sound the band included electric instrumentation on the record, but it still was a commercial failure.

London 1892, p. 190. In the first half of 14th century, several imams had disputed the succession. About the middle of the century, his father Ali al-Mahdi ibn Muhammad attained considerable influence, which was however reduced before his death in Dhamar in 1372. Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din became the sole Zaydi imam of Yemen. However, the important city San'a was in the hands of a Zaidi family that ruled as emirs. In the year after his accession, al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al- Din attempted to seize San'a, but was unable to penetrate the strong defences. Instead, he resorted to strategy. He married the mother of the emir Idris bin Abdallah, but when Idris came to meet his new step-father, the latter arrested him and then marched into San'a in full force, in 1381. Idris and his mother were allowed to live in the city, but had no further contact with the imam.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 66. Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din was a comparatively successful ruler; he advanced as far as the Tihama in the coastland of South Arabia, moving against the Rasulids. In 1391 he was thrown off his mule and dragged along, receiving fatal injuries. When he died in San'a, his death was concealed for two months on account of insecurity.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 996. He is buried in the Salah al-Din Mosque, built on his initiative. He was the husband of as-Sayyidah Fatimah, daughter of the headman of the Kurds in Dhamar, who built the al-Abhar Mosque in San'a.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, 1983, p. 370. The death of al-Nasir was followed by internal turmoil among the Zaydi elite, but control over San'a was soon acquired by his young son al- Mansur Ali bin Salah al-Din.  His literary work  Al-Nasir Muhammad Salah al-Din wrote a commentary on al-Zamakhshari's al-Kalim al-Nawabigh. He titled his work al-Hikam al-Sawabigh fi al-Kalim al-Nawabigh. In the same period of time, al-Taftazani (d. 1390) wrote also a commentary on al-Zamakhshari's work with slightly different title: al-Ni'am al-Sawabigh fi al-Kalim al-Nawabigh.

The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration but went into a decline in the mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style remained popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn. Similar \\"beef and beer fundraisers\\" are common in the Philadelphia region, especially in white working class communities. Origins Beefsteak banquets originated among the working class of New York City in the mid-1800s as celebratory meals or \\"testimonials\\". The meal would generally be set up by an organization wishing to laud or raise money for politicians, newly promoted friends, or celebrities. Tammany Hall regularly threw beefsteaks as political fundraisers, often enough that it was a large portion of beefsteak business in New York and \\"when Tammany Hall [got] a setback, beefsteaks [got] a setback\\". Sophie Tucker and Bill Robinson had beefsteaks thrown for them in the 1930s. Early beefsteaks were held in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or residential basements. Food and drink were the focus of the evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands were sometimes hired. Early organization Beef tenderloin being sliced Though the centerpiece of beefsteak culture was indisputably the frenzied consumption of beef and beer, with diners eating with their fingers and drinking with abandon, serving styles varied. 1930s-era beefsteaks could be grouped into two styles, referred to by Joseph Mitchell in a 1939 The New Yorker article as \\"East Side\\" and \\"West Side\\" and roughly corresponding to the geographic separation of New York City into the same-named areas. Each group claimed to Mitchell to have originated beefsteak banquets and to have the most authentic serving and eating styles. \\"East Side\\" beefsteaks were largely patronized by the working- class and immigrants, and the center of the East Side beefsteak world was at First Avenue and Nineteenth Street in Manhattan. East Side beefsteaks were heavily meat-centered, with courses consisting of items like sliced beef short loin, beef kidneys, and ground beef trimmings (referred to as \\"hamburgers\\"). One East Side beefsteak was reported to have consisted of \\" of steak, of lamb chops, of hamburger and of kidneys wrapped with bacon.\\" \\"West Side\\" beefsteaks, on the other hand, were often thrown at \\"gentlemen-only\\" establishments centered on Eleventh Avenue and 23rd Street. West Side beefsteaks tended more toward expansive menus, with courses including crab meat, lamb chops, and baked potatoes to go along with the beef loin. Diners at West Side beefsteaks were allowed to use disposable forks for some courses, but were expected to eat the beef course with their fingers. Dining style Both schools of thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not being afraid to get messy were integral to the culture of the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce and served thinly sliced on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe the grease off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid out on trays and waiters continued bringing out trays until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, \\"I'm so full I'm about to pop. Push those kidneys a little nearer, if you don't mind.\\"). Beer flowed freely during banquets in pre-prohibition years. Evolution With the passing of the 18th and 19th amendments to the U.S. Constitution, in 1919 and 1920, respectively, the traditional men-only, beer-soaked format of the beefsteak began to change. Politicians began including newly enfranchised women voters in their beefsteak banquets after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, and with the attendance of women came corresponding social niceties. Cocktails, popularized by illicit drinkers during Prohibition, replaced pitchers of beer, and \\"fruit cups[ ] and fancy salads\\" were soon added to beefsteak menus. Orchestras were hired in place of old-fashioned brass bands and storytellers, and the long- forbidden knives and forks began to appear on beefsteak tables. By the 1930s, according to Joseph Mitchell, beefsteaks were no longer the manly, messy affairs they had once been; they were now closer to formal meals in which beef and bread happened to feature heavily. The cheerful gluttony of the past was tempered by female sensibilities; \\"women,\\" Mitchell reported, \\"do not esteem a glutton, and at a contemporary beefsteak it is unusual for a man to do away with more than six pounds of meat and thirty glasses of beer.\\" In 1938, \\"Hap\\" Nightingale, a butcher in Clifton, New Jersey, began catering parties in his area according to the old-time beefsteak formula. He offered a set, all-you- can-eat menu of French fries and sliced beef tenderloin on bread. His business thrived locally, and the company has since been passed down through ensuing generations of Nightingales, all of whom continued to adhere to the tried-and- true formula. Current practice Two diners' bread piled to \\"keep count\\" at a beefsteak The modern beefsteak banquet hews fairly closely to the early-1900s model, although the expansive selections found at an old-fashioned \\"West Side\\" beefsteak have been tapered down to beef, fried potatoes, and tossed salad. Butter is sometimes replaced by margarine, and a pasta course makes an occasional appearance, but attendees at beefsteaks still expect to be fed mostly abundant quantities of beef tenderloin. Modern beefsteak attendees often follow an unspoken protocol to leave their bread slices uneaten. Piling them up in front of one's plate instead of consuming them \\"saves valuable stomach capacity for more beef while simultaneously serving as an informal scorekeeping system\\". Modern distribution Beefsteak banquets have largely vanished from New York City, where they originated, but remain widespread in Bergen and Passaic counties in New Jersey. The institution is now almost entirely limited to these areas, save for a popular biannual beefsteak held in Brooklyn; while residents of Bergen and Passaic counties consider them an ingrained part of regional culture and regularly stage beefsteak fundraisers (caterers interviewed in a New York Times article stated that they \\"put on about 1,000 of them in the region [in 2007]\\"), across the county line in Essex County, for example, they remain nearly unheard of. Regis High School and Xavier High School (Jesuit schools on the Upper East Side and in Chelsea respectively) each host an annual traditional beefsteak for alumni. Political fundraiser beefsteak banquets are no longer common in New Jersey; beefsteaks now usually raise money for fire departments, policemen's benevolent associations, and other charitable organizations. Nostalgia for beefsteaks among foodies continues, and gourmet beefsteaks are sometimes staged by New York-area restaurants. Since 2009, two Wesleyan University graduates, Andrew Dermont and Derek Silverman, have thrown a biannual \\"beefsteak for beefsteak's sake\\" in Brooklyn, to revive the tradition of the beefsteak banquet in its place of origin, New York City. Since 2011, Chef Neal Fraser, Cort Cass, Matt Selman and Eric Wareheim have hosted a beefsteak in Los Angeles to raise money for the LA Food Bank. Since 2015, Chef Tom Colicchio's Riverpark Restaurant on the East River in Manhattan has hosted an annual (\\"West Side\\" style) Beefsteak every February.

Early life William was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 8 April 1742, the fifth child (and third son) of Samuel McCormick, the General Examiner of Excise, and his wife Helen. He worked as a clerk in the office of the solicitor of excise in Edinburgh, including two years working for T. Wharton, one of the Commissioners of Excise. He was apparently headed for promotion when he decided to emigrate to America, leaving in early 1761. Life in North Carolina William's first job was working for Thomas MacKnight & Co in North Carolina.Hugh Edward Egerton (ed), The Royal Commission on the Losses and Services of American Loyalists, 1783-1785 (New York: Arno Press and the New York Times, 1969), p. 368. MacKnight was a Scotsman who had emigrated to North Carolina in 1755, and was almost certainly a relative of William's by marriage. William lived in the settlement of Windfield in the northeastern part of the province on the Pasquotank River. The Pasquotank had become an important artery of commerce, the main industries being transport, logging, and oyster harvesting. North Carolina was not heavily populated, but Windfield was on the coastal road to Virginia and well situated for trade. At some point in the 1760s William set up a company in his own name in which he had a 20% share, the balance being held by Thomas MacKnight (40%), James Parker (20%), and William Aitchison (20%). The company traded to Europe and the West Indies. By the late 1760s, William was one of the leading members of North Carolina society, or certainly of Pasquotank County society. In November 1771, he was appointed Register (described in other places as Registrar) of Pasquotank County by Josiah Martin, governor of North Carolina (in office 1771-75). A month later, Governor Martin, 'reposing especial trust and confidence in your loyalty, courage, and good conduct', appointed William as a captain in the Pasquotank regiment of militia, commanded by Colonel John Lowry. William McCormick & Co owned a small port and cargo facility at Windfield on 25 acres of land, several ships, and two plantations covering a total of more than 1,000 acres, well stocked with cattle, pigs, and sheep. According to one of his employees, Caleb Church, William had a house with several well-furnished rooms, which he kept 'in a very genteel way, and at a great expense', and he travelled with 'two horses and a chair and servant' and had 'several clerks in his counting house'.Memorial of William McCormick to the Royal Commission on the Losses Services of American Loyalists, p. 7 But the colonial era was drawing to a close. Tensions began to build between Britain and the colonies in the early 1770s as Americans resisted the right of the British Parliament to govern without representation. Colonists were divided over which side to take during the buildup to the war, and during the war itself. About 40-45 per cent supported the revolutionaries (or patriots), about 15-20 per cent‚Äîknown as loyalists, Tories or 'King's Men'‚Äîsupported the British Crown, and the balance stayed neutral. William was clearly a loyalist, and was later described by one of his employees as 'one of the greatest Tories in the county.' Loyalists may have agreed with some of the principles being pursued by the revolutionaries, but they did not want to go to war over the issue. Life as a Loyalist The first tangible effect of the unrest on William came in late 1775/early 1776 when the Belville and the Betsy, two ships (most likely brigantines, or two- masted merchant ships) owned by William McCormick & Co, were lost. The Belville (built in 1772) sailed from Windfield in December 1775 bound for Cadiz in Spain with a cargo of 500 pounds of beeswax, 61,900 pipe staves, 600 hoghead staves, and 3400 barrel staves. Because the Restraining Act (passed in 1775 in response to an American boycott of British goods, and prohibiting trade with all countries except Britain) did not extend to North Carolina (because the British government mistakenly thought that North Carolina was not part of the boycott), the ship was regularly cleared on her journeys, but this time she was intercepted by an American vessel soon after leaving. Afraid that the ship would be captured by a British vessel that hove into sight, the captain of the American ship ordered that the cargo of the Belville be dumped overboard and the vessel be taken to New Bern. William gave bond and security to get the vessel back, she was reloaded, and she left again in early 1776. She was within a day's sail of Cadiz when she was taken by a British man of war off the coast of Spain, taken to Gibraltar, and condemned as the property of a colony in rebellion under the terms of the Prohibitory Act; this was passed in December 1775, coming into force on 1 January 1776, and aimed at destroying the American economy through a trade blockade. The ship was valued at ¬£1500, the cargo at ¬£600, and a slave on board at ¬£80; everything was handed over to the captors as a prize. The second lost ship, the Betsy, was captured by a British man of war in April/May 1776, ironically in the process of carrying provisions from North Carolina to British troops stationed in Norfolk, at the request of Lord Dunmore, governor of Virginia. As William and his partners later observed, they were 'plundered by the Americans for our loyalty on the one hand, and thus punished as partisans of rebellion on the other'. As a loyalist who worked for the Crown, William was in a risky situation, particularly because the Second Continental Congress declared that the property of loyalists would be subject to seizure as a means of financing hostilities against England. The first North Carolina law providing for confiscation of property had been passed in November 1776, but commissioners had already been appointed to take an inventory of estates. An act of banishment against loyalists was passed in April 1777 which included the possible penalty of death for loyalists, and required everyone in the state either to take an oath of allegiance or to leave the state within 60 days. They could sell their property before leaving, otherwise it was forfeited. William arranged for a brigantine named the Johnston that he owned jointly with Thomas MacKnight to be repaired and loaded in case of the need for a hasty departure. The boat eventually set sail in September 1777 under the pretence that it was bound for Spain, but William told the other passengers that it was his plan to go to New York and seek protection. He arrived back in Britain in about November 1778, so in all it took 14 months to make a trip that should only have taken two months. Return to Britain Although the surrender at Yorktown in October 1781 did not mean the end of hostilities (Britain decided to suspend operations to recover the colonies in March 1782), within weeks every American state had passed a confiscation act, and loyalists had lost property worth millions of pounds. Article V of the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the war provided that Congress would 'earnestly recommend' that states recognize the rightful owners of all confiscated lands and 'provide for the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to real British subjects'. Also, all other loyalists were to be allowed to return to their former homes for up to 12 months to recover their property or to buy back their land from the new owners. In the event, only South Carolina responded to the plea. Confiscation of property in North Carolina had begun in January 1779, and early in 1780 the property of William McCormick & Co of Pasquotank County was sold for ¬£102,870. By October 1782 more than 300 British-based American loyalists were receiving financial aid from Parliament. Two members of Parliament‚ÄîJohn Wilmot and Daniel Parker Coke‚Äîwere behind the passage of a 1783 Act of Parliament setting up a Royal Commission looking into the situation of the loyalists; this met sporadically between 1783 and 1788, and reported for the last time in May 1789. It gathered information and took statements with the object of providing advice to the government on who should be compensated. Their work was supported by the efforts of the loyalists themselves, who in March and July 1783 held meetings at the London Coffee House under the chairmanship of James Parker, and set up a committee (with Thomas MacKnight as one of the members) to decide who had legitimate claims; William was among the 40 or so chosen, with McCormick & Company listed separately. A total of 3,225 claims were examined by the Commission, and the total final amount awarded was ¬£3,033,091; a long way short of the more than ¬£10.3 million claimed.

Parsons drove in SCCA and USSRC competition, then became a driver in the Can Am series. Like many drivers of the era, he participated in multiple venues, such as the 24 Hours of Daytona and 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance races while driving the same year in the Can Am series. Career Parsons was born in 1924 in Bruin, Kentucky. He moved to California at age 24 and settled near Monterey. Parsons worked in automobile sales and eventually owned his own import car lot. At age 31, he bought his first competition car, an Austin-Healey, from the proceeds of his work in sales. After he raced the Healey in amateur events, he moved on briefly to a Porsche, then a Lotus type 15. In 1959, he bought a Maserati Birdcage racer from Texan Jim Hall, later of Chaparral cars fame. Following his experience with the Maserati, which turned out to be expensive to operate, Parsons sold the Birdcage and raced a Sunbeam Alpine roadster. The Alpine racing effort was sponsored by Randy Hilton. During the 1963 SCCA season in California, he raced a Lotus 23B twin cam. By 1964, he was driving an AC Cobra roadster powered by a 289 cubic inch Ford V8. In 1965, he campaigned a Genie - Chevy Mark 10. In 1966, he switched to a McLaren-Elva Mark II, and won the USSRC Championship, with a win at the final race at Road America, and second-place finishes at Laguna Seca Raceway, Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, and Las Vegas. Later in 1966, Parsons began driving in the Canadian American Challenge Cup with a Chevrolet powered McLaren. Parsons drove a series of historic Can Am cars over the next six years. In 1968, he drove a Lola T160, the following two years a Lola T163. During the 1971 Can Am campaign, Parsons raced a McLaren M8D, another Lola T163, and eventually returned to the cockpit of a McLaren M8D by the end of the season. The last M8D he drove belonged to actor-driver Paul Newman. The original Can Am series was from 1966 to 1974. In the years that Parsons participated, he scored 145 points, which places him eighth overall among Can Am drivers. His highest total was 81 points in 1969. 1969 was also the year of his highest finish as an endurance race car driver, when he won the prestigious 24 Hours of Daytona with Mark Donohue as a co-driver in a Penske Racing Lola T70 coupe. Parsons had been a last-minute substitute for an injured team driver, and Donohue gave Parsons credit as being key to the win, even though Donohue drove most of the race. In 1970, Parsons drove a Ferrari 312P at the rainy 24 Hours of Le Mans race, where he finished 10th overall with fellow American driver Tony Adamowicz. In addition to Donohue and Adamowicz, Parsons teamed once with Jo Bonnier at Watkins Glen International in 1969. Parsons also briefly drove Formula 5000 and, in 1967, drove in a USAC Championship Car race at Riverside International Raceway.Chuck Parsons, Champ Car Stats, Retrieved 2010-12-06 After his racing career, Parsons lived in California until his death on January 3, 1999.

The village was platted in March, 1836, and was located at the first dam and locks on the Des Moines River authorized by the state in 1839. Soon it had two grist mills and a saw mill. It was named \\"Benton's Port\\" for Thomas Hart Benton and once had a population of about 1,000. It declined after the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines and Minnesota Railroad reached Des Moines in 1866. The river became non-navigable in 1870 and the dam and locks deteriorated, with the dam \\"failing\\" in 1879. The Bentonsport bridge opened in 1883 and is \\"the oldest wagon bridge of its type remaining on the Des Moines River.\\" Today the village has 40 residents, many of them artists and bed & breakfast keepers.

It provides integration and fulfillment services to both online and brick and mortar retailers, distributors, and supplier companies such Sears, MSC Industrial Direct, Kohl‚Äôs, Costco, QVC, Staples, Best Buy, Meijer, drugstore.com, Walgreens, Dell, Toshiba, Sanyo, Minolta, Gateway and Little Tikes. CommerceHub was formed in 1997 to develop e-commerce integration services for the sharing of data and business processes between trading partners. As online retailing was developing, merchants were fulfilling orders via ‚Äúvirtual merchant‚Äù business models, selling online and fulfilling orders via drop shipping. Founder Frank Poore, a logistics expert familiar with retailer order management systems, recognized the growing online business was attracting retailers that had never sold direct and would change the way retailers and manufacturers needed to communicate to make drop shipping work. Merchant data transmitted via a value-added network (VAN) was generally formatted as electronic data interchange (EDI). Online businesses found EDI was too cumbersome to accommodate all the file formats and business rules the growing volume of e-commerce retailers required. CommerceHub developed a web-based approach to serve e-commerce integration needs with their Universal Connection Hub, a translation engine that provides integration to translate and normalize supply chain communications, and enable electronic processing of purchase orders, change orders, and remittance confirmations in native file format. The Universal Connection Hub supports industry communications and file format options including web browser, VPN, VAN, FTP, web services, HTTPS, EDI, XML, flat files, spreadsheets, and others. In 1998 drop-ship fulfillment services were added to the connectivity hub to provide management and monitoring of the order fulfillment life cycle. CommerceHub‚Äôs DropShip Master provided order tracking, visibility, and event management with automated exception alerts to customizable business rules. In August 2000 CommerceHub received a multimillion-dollar investment from Interactive Technology Holdings, LLC, and announced the signing of a contract with iQVC, the online retailing division of QVC, to provide electronic business communications between iQVC and its participating vendors to automate management of iQVC customer service operations from point of sale through delivery. The company became profitable in 2002 with the signing of four Top 20 retailers. By 2003 CommerceHub had signed on 10 major e-commerce retailers and announced in 2004 that its network of integrated clients was approaching one thousand organizations representing nearly a million unique product SKUs. CommerceHub was acquired by QK Holdings, a supply-chain management company, in an all-cash transaction, announced in August 2006. That same year Stephen Hamlin, former vice president of operations at QVC.com, joined the company as CEO. CommerceHub went public in 2016 and was traded on NASDAQ. In May of 2018 it was acquired for $1.1 billion by GTCR and Sycamore Partners private equity firms, who took it private. The CommerceHub headquarters is located in Albany, New York.

He was born in 1292, being eighteen years of age at his father's death, before 24 May 1310. During a distinguished career he was knighted in 1324, made a Knight banneret in 1337, a Knight of the garter between 15 May 1358 and 1360, and summoned to parliament as Baron Ughtred on 30 April 1344. Marriage and issue He married before January 1328 ‚Äì 1329, Margaret Burdon, daughter of Brian Burdon of Kexby, North Yorkshire and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir John de Meaux, of Gowthorpe, Yorkshire.

Career On 8 June 1319 he was appointed commissioner of array for Yorkshire, an office which he frequently filled during Edward II's reign. In October 1319 he served at the siege of Berwick, in command of forty-four hobelars or light horse. On 6 October 1320 he was returned to parliament as knight of the shire for his county. He sided with the king against Thomas of Lancaster, and on 14 March 1322 was empowered to arrest any of the earl's adherents. In the same year he was made constable of Pickering Castle, seems to have been captured by the Scots, and in the following March went to Scotland to release his hostages. In the same month he was granted the custody of the manor of Bentele, Yorkshire, during the minority of Payn de Tibetot or Tiptoft. He attended a great council held at Westminster in June 1324, and was knighted in the same year. On 14 April 1328 he was placed on a commission of oyer and terminer, and in 1330 and 1331‚Äì2 again represented Yorkshire in parliament. Edward III confirmed the grants made to Ughtred, and in 1331 placed him on the commissions of the peace between the River Ouse and the River Derwent, and in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1332 he acquired a house and garden called Le Whitehalle in Berwick, and in the same year he accompanied Edward Balliol on his invasion of Scotland. The expedition landed at Kinghorn and defeated the Earl of Fife at Dupplin Moor on 12 August. Ughtred was apparently present at Balliol's coronation at Scone on 24 September, and sat in the Scottish parliament as Baron of Innerwick. On 20 October Balliol granted him the manor of Bonkill, which was confirmed by Edward III on 19 June 1334. In the summer of 1334 the Scots rose against Balliol, who sent Ughtred to Edward with a request for help. Balliol was, however, driven out of Scotland, and during the retreat Ughtred held the bridge at Roxburgh against the Scots and secured Balliol's retreat. In the same year he was made a knight-banneret. In 1338 Edward III required Balliol to entrust the command of Perth, threatened with a siege by Robert the Steward, to Ughtred. He took over the command on 4 August, on condition that he was given a garrison of 220 men in time of peace and eight hundred in time of war. These conditions were not kept, however, and early in 1339 Ughtred petitioned the English government to be relieved of his charge. He was urged to remain until the arrival of reinforcements, but these were not despatched in time, and on 16 August 1339 Ughtred was compelled to surrender. This led to aspersions on his courage, and he complained to parliament at Westminster. His explanations were held sufficient, and in April 1340 the grant of Bonkill was confirmed to him. In the following year Ughtred was attached to Robert of Artois's expedition against France. Siege was laid to Saint-Omer, and on 26 July 1340 the French attacked the Flemings and would have raised the siege had not Ughtred with his archers restored the fortunes of the day. He was again summoned to serve against the French on 13 May 1347; on 14 June 1352 he was appointed warden of the sea coast of Yorkshire, and on 16 April 1360 he again received protection on crossing the seas on the king's service. Ughtred is said to have received summonses to parliament from 30 April 1344 to 4 December 1364, and is accordingly regarded as a peer. However, in 1357 he was referred to as \\"Thomas Ughtred, knight, the elder\\" and in 1360 he was styled simply \\"chivaler\\"; none of his descendants were summoned to parliament, and it has been suggested that he represented Yorkshire in the House of Commons in 1344 and 1352. Death and descendants All Saints Church, Low Catton, East Riding of Yorkshire, England Sir Thomas Ughtred died before 28 May in 1365 and was buried in Catton church. He was succeeded by his son, Thomas, who by then had been knighted. Sir Thomas Ughtred owned vast estates in Yorkshire. He was constable of Lochmaben Castle in 1376‚Äì7 and served against the French in 1377 and 1379. In 1383 his name appears in the retinue of the Earl of Northumberland, then Governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed. He died 18 November 1401, having outlived his son and heir, William. William Ughtred married Catherine, daughter of Peter, Lord Mauley and his first wife, Margaret Clifford, and by her had a son, Thomas, who subsequently became his grandfather's heir. Neither he nor any of his descendants were ever summoned to parliament. Anthony Ughtred (d. 1534), a later member of the family, took a prominent part in the French and Scots wars of Henry VIII. During 1513‚Äì14 he was marshal of Tournai after its capture from the French, and from February 1515 to August 1532 he was captain of Berwick. He was subsequently appointed governor of Jersey, and held that office till his death in 1534. His widow, Elizabeth Seymour, daughter of Sir John Seymour and sister of Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII married Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, eldest son of Thomas Cromwell.

Description The fungus white sporocarps measure by , and have a central strand of filamentous hyphae. The surface is pulverulent‚Äîas if covered with a fine white powder. There are no basidia, basidiospores, nor clamp connections present in the hyphae. The fungus produces arthrospores, specialized uninucleate cells that function like a spore and formed vegetatively. The arthrospores have thin walls, and are hyaline (translucent) and smooth. The fungus is the anamorph (asexual stage) of the species Arthrosporella ditopa; the arthroconidia are produced directly on the stem of that species to give it a powdery appearance.

The corporation is organized for the purpose of providing students with experiences and instruction in the visual and performing arts and to enrich communities with cultural events. The corporation produces the Sarasota Chalk Festival, a cultural event designed to that celebrate the sixteenth century performance art of Italian street painting. The corporation functions solely on donations from patrons, sponsorships, and grants and it is a fully volunteer organization. First international street painting festival in the U.S. While pursuing its mission to create cultural events, in 2010, the Avenida de Colores made history by producing the first international street painting festival in the United States, called the Sarasota Chalk Festival. Street painting festivals started in the United States in 1987, but this festival was the first to attract many renowned street painting artists from all over the world to participate. The festival had notable Guinness World Record holders Edgar Mueller from Germany, Leon Keer from Netherlands, and Tracy Lee Stum from the USA. Genna Panzarella from the USA, who was the first woman to receive Italy's honorable Maestra Madonnari title at the International Grazi di Curtatone competition, participated as well as Vera Bugatti from Italy, who also holds the Maestra Madonnari title. Maestro Madonnaro Edgar Mueller created a 100' x 40' 3-D street painting that is the first known contemporary street painting that metamorphosed from one image to another with the change from day to night because the painter used photoluminescent paints. The Sarasota Chalk Festival also was the first street painting festival to have a Halloween-theme for the artists work as well as three oversized 3-D installations, one of which incorporating two-point perspective. A catalogue (right) entitled, Sarasota Chalk Festival, was published by Avenida de Colores following the 2010 festival. Exceeding two hundred pages, it provides an extensive history of the street painting it features at the festival and discusses many of the artists who have become famous for performing the art at various locations around the world. Many of these artists performed at the debut of the new international status of the festival. The catalogue provides examples of their work‚Äîeither here or abroad, some being works produced at the 2010 festival, which had a festive Halloween theme. It also describes the music and arts present in Sarasota, which has earned the area the reputation as the \\"Cultural Coast\\" of Florida. It also presents information about many of the attractive Sarasota beaches has on the Gulf of Mexico. This catalogue has been available at each festival since its publication and is available at the festival offices throughout the year. Sarasota Chalk Festival History As president of the Burns Square Property Owners Association, Inc., in 2007, Kowal founded a nonprofit corporation, the Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival, a street painting festival held on South Pineapple Avenue in the downtown Sarasota historic area known as Burns Square. Only twenty-two artists participated in this first festival. Lori Escalera, a leading modern Madonnari from the USA was the only professional street painter who participated. In 2009, the second Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival was held with approximately one hundred street painters participating, who were drawn from all over the USA, and more than two hundred local stage performers. In 2010, the Burns Square Property Owners Association relinquished the Avenida de Colores Chalk Festival to the Avenida de Colores nonprofit corporation. The street painting festival was renamed the Sarasota Chalk Festival and has grown into one of the most important street painting festivals in the world. The festival expanded several blocks in Burns Square to accommodate the two hundred and fifty street painters who participated, being drawn from all over the world, which made the Sarasota Chalk Festival the first international street painting festival in the United States. The festival has been relocated to Venice (also in Sarasota County) where more space is available to accommodate the large crowds attracted to the event.

He is also the president and founder of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association, founder of the American- Ukrainian Bureau for Human Rights, director of the International Medical Rehabilitation Center for the Victims of War and Totalitarian Regimes, a member of the Council of Experts under the Ukraine's Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. He also is co-chairperson of the Babi Yar Committee and former dissident and political prisoner. He holds M.D. qualification. Biography His father was doctor of medical sciences Fischel Abramovich Gluzman (1904‚Äî1987). In 1968, he graduated from the Kyiv Medical Institute. After graduation, Gluzman started working in Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals and was offered a position at the Dnipropetrovsk Special Psychiatric Hospital in a city not far from the Black Sea. Semyon Gluzman was the first psychiatrist in the Soviet Union to openly oppose Soviet abuse of psychiatry against dissenters. In 1971, Gluzman wrote an in-absentia psychiatric report on General Petro Grigorenko who spoke against the human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for defending Grigorenko against the charge of insanity. On 28 November 1977, Amnesty International added Gluzman to its list of 92 members of the medical profession who were imprisoned for their political beliefs. While in prison Gluzman and fellow inmate Vladimir Bukovsky jointly wrote A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents published in Russian, English, French, Italian, German, Danish. In the 1980s Gluzman (who is a Jew) turned down offers to migrate to Israel by \\"people sent from American synagogues\\" and even Soviet officials.[ In 1991, Gluzman founded the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association (UPA) as an independent mouthpiece and created a commission to address grievances about civil rights violations by mental health administrators. In recognition of his courage and commitment to ethical psychiatry, Gluzman was given the title of a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatry Association and the title of an Honorary Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1980. In 2008, Semyon Gluzman was honored with the Geneva Prize for Human Rights in Psychiatry presented to him at the XIV Congress of the World Psychiatric Association in Prague for exceptional courage and adherence to ideals of humanism, for renunciation of using psychiatry against political dissidents as well as for dissemination of ethical principles during the reform of mental health service in Ukraine. Gluzman coauthored many research papers covering psychiatry in Ukraine,; ; ; ; the health consequences of the Chornobyl accident,; ; ; their risk perceptions,; ; ; suicide ideation,; heavy alcohol use,; nicotine dependence, intimate partner aggression.

They are T-shaped devices with a silicone-coated nylon core. The silicone coating is impregnated with progesterone. CIDRs are inserted intra-vaginally using a specialized applicator. The flexible wings collapse for facilitated insertion and expand once placed appropriately within the vagina. The expansion of the wings retains its position; CIDRs have very high retention rates that may exceed 97%.Eric Grant. 2006. Understanding CIDR. National Association of Animal Breeders. Feb 1, 2006. Retrieved March 20, 2012, from Beef Magazine: http://beefmagazine.com/mag/beef_understanding_cidr A thin nylon tail remains exteriorized and is used for removal. Once inserted, CIDRs provide slow-release administration of progesterone, which artificially extends the luteal phase. Plasma progesterone levels rapidly increase upon insertion, and remain relatively consistent while in place. Following CIDR removal, progesterone levels decrease rapidly. Occasionally, vaginal irritation may occur. This is normal and does not impact the effectiveness of the device or the animal‚Äôs performance. There are several types of CIDRs available, including CIDR-B for cattle, CIDR-S for sheep and CIDR-G for goats. CIDRs are similar to the progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID), also used for synchronization of estrous cycles in livestock. Uses CIDRs are approved for use in both beef cattle and dairy heifers in Canada and the United States. CIDRs contain 1.9g of progesterone in Canada and 1.38g in the United States. The CIDR-S is licensed for use in sheep and goats in New Zealand and Australia. The CIDR-G is also suitable for use in ewes, lambs and goats. Oestrus synchronization Cattle In cattle, CIDR-Bs are often used with synchronization protocols. The product label typically indicates that, in conjunction with an appropriate synchronization protocol, CIDRs should be left in for 7 days. Ovsynch is a particular protocol that is often followed. These estrus synchronization protocols allow Fixed Time Artificial Insemination to be used, giving herd managers more accurate control. The use of CIDRs with synchronization protocols helps improve reproductive performance by reducing the inefficiency associated with estrus detection. Although there is variability in the response to estrus synchronization, studies show consistently high pregnancy rates following Fixed Time Artificial Insemination with CIDR synchronization of ovarian follicle development.  Sheep and goats  Previously, intravaginal progestogen sponges were a common method of estrus manipulation in ewes. The development and success of CIDRs has increased their use in sheep and goats. Unlike intravaginal progestogen sponges, CIDRs do not absorb or impede drainage of natural vaginal secretions, offering a cleaner method of delivery. They also allow administration of a natural form of hormone, as opposed to the potent analogues used in sponges. A dose of 550 mg of progesterone has been found to be effective in controlling estrus and ovulation in sheep.  Treatment of follicular cysts  CIDRs may be used as a treatment in cows with follicular cysts. Follicular cysts in cattle affect a significant proportion of dairy cows in several countries, and hinder the dairy industry by extending the period from calving to conception. CIDRs help by reducing the Luteinizing Hormone pulse frequency and inducing atresia of cystic follicles. This may also allow affected cows to be re-used in breeding or embryo transfer programs. History CIDRs were developed by AHI Plastic Moulding Company in Hamilton, New Zealand, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand). Developmental trials began in 1981. The CIDR-S was licensed in 1986 and the CIDR-G in 1988.

It has been obsoleted by Calligra Words of the Calligra Suite.  History  KWord was created by Reginald Stadlbauer as part of the KOffice project in 1998 using several ideas from FrameMaker, such as the use of frames. The original author confessed that the application and its code were not top notch since it was his first object-oriented application. Until 2012, KWord was being actively developed along with the rest of the KOffice suite. Beginning with KOffice 2.4 the developers aimed to release new KOffice versions every six months in sync with SC4 releases but KOffice had seen no development activity since mid-March 2012. After two minor commits in August 2012 the koffice.org website was replaced by a placeholder in early September 2012. On KDE removed KOffice from their Quality Website Tools.  Features  The text-layout scheme in KWord is based on frames, making it similar to FrameMaker by Adobe. These can be placed anywhere on the page, and can incorporate text, graphics and embedded objects. Each new page is a new frame, but the text is able to flow through KWord‚Äôs ability to link frames together. The use of frames means that complex graphical layouts can be achieved relatively easily in KWord. Many desktop publishing (DTP) applications use frames, much like KWord does, but these DTP applications use a concept called master pages which gives the power to the user to design the structure of the document. However, KWord developers designed the frames usage to be a usable variant of master pages, with intelligent copying of frames and their position when a new page is created, for example when there is too much text for a page.

He has been called \\"the father of the history of education in England\\". Life Leach was born in 1851, the son of Thomas Leach, barrister. He was educated from 1862 at Highgate School, then at Winchester College and won a scholarship to New College, Oxford, where he obtained a first in Classics. He won the Stanhope essay prize in 1872, and from 1874 to 1881 was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He studied law, and became a barrister of the Middle Temple in 1876. In 1884, Leach became an assistant charity commissioner. He was asked to investigate the histories of The Prebendal School, Chichester, and Southwell Grammar School. He found that, contrary to common belief, there had been many such schools in the medieval period that were independent of the monasteries, founded long before the independent schools of the Renaissance and Reformation such as Winchester, Eton College and Warwick School. The exploration of this subject became his life study, and he published many books on his findings while continuing to work at the Charity Commission, where he rose to a senior position before his death in 1915. Work Leach's main theses were that English schools had greater antiquity than had been thought, and that the Tudors had not been the major patrons of English education. Between 1894 and 1915 he published nine books on the history of education, based on material from the British Museum, the Public Record Office and local archives; his approach laid the foundation for modern research into the subject. He was, however, sometimes slapdash with dates, opinionated and inclined to ignore aspects that did not interest him, which undermined his reputation. He downplayed the contributions of monastic schools, overestimated the role of chantry schools and failed to explore the curricula of the non-monastic schools. Leach had an eye for beauty. Several of his works related to Beverley Minster in Yorkshire, of which he said there is no more beautiful building in England. He said it \\"dominates the landscape with an impressiveness of grandeur that the mother-church of York cannot surpass\\". His main focus was on schools of the 16th century or earlier. He did publish an article on 18th century schools in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, but it was dismissive. He said \\"Never probably since the 9th century was the condition of the public schools of England worse than in the years 1750 to 1840.\\" He thought that the fundamental goal of a school in meeting its obligations as a charitable trust was to teach Latin and Greek, and was strongly opposed to non-classical teaching. Leach pointed out that the history of education differs from the history of opinions about what education should be, and is more than a collection of biographies of prominent teachers. A modern scholar has said that his The Schools of Medieval England published in 1915, the year of his death, \\"formed the basis for all subsequent work on medieval and Reformation schooling until the publication of Nicholas Orme.s English Schools in the Middle Ages in 1973\\". However, the same scholar goes on to say that his claims \\"were not always sufficiently supported by his sources\\".

The genus is monotypic, containing the single species Caripia montagnei, commonly known as the pod parachute. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Formerly classified in the Stereales (a now obsolete order that has been merged into the Russulales), molecular analysis published in 2002 demonstrated that the fungus is a reduced form of the closely related Gymnopus. Taxonomy The genus Caripia was circumscribed by Otto Kuntze in 1898 to contain Hypolyssus montagnei, a species originally described by Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1842. Berkeley obtained the original specimens from Camille Montagne, who collected them from Guyana. Kuntze did not elaborate on the characteristics of the genus, instead referring to Pier Andrea Saccardo's description of Hypolyssus in the 6th volume of his 1888 publication Sylloge Fungorum. In 1953, the proposal to conserve the generic name Hypolyssus vs. Caripia was rejected by the Special Committee for Fungi. Other generic names that have been applied to the fungus are Podostrombium, published invalidly by Otto Kuntze in 1828, Heringia, published invalidly by Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1853, and Christian Hendrik Persoon's 1828 Perona. The generic name Caripia refers to the Caripi River in northern Brazil. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"pod parachute\\". Description The goblet or pod- shaped fruit bodies of Caripia montagnei are up to tall with a cap diameter up to . The cap margin of young fruit bodies curves slightly inward, but the caps enlarge by intercalary growth between the top of the stipe and the margin, so older specimens develop an obconic (reversed cone) or roughly cylindrical shape with a flattened, and then concave top. The color is whitish to cream, and the surface texture is initially smooth, although the fruit body can develop wrinkles in age. The thin, smooth stipe is brown to purplish brown. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue) is on the outside surface of the cap, rather than the inside, as is usual for cup-shaped fungi. It grows to about 300 ¬µm thick, and develops irregular surface lumps. The thin-walled spores are narrowly pip-shaped, inamyloid, and measure 5‚Äì6 by 2.5‚Äì3.3 ¬µm. Another stalked cup fungus, Dumontinia tuberosa (formerly Sclerotinia tuberosa), is vaguely similar in appearance to Caripia montagnei, but it is larger, with cups up to across and stipes up to , and the cups are brown. Habitat and distribution Caripia montagnei occurs in the woodlands of Central America and South America, where it grows in close groups on branches and sticks of deciduous trees. Bioactive compounds The pyridyloxirane compound caripyrin (trans-5-(3-methyloxiranyl)pyridincarboxylic acid methyl ester) was isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of the fungus and reported in 2010. The chemical inhibits the conidial germination and appressorium formation of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Compared to the structurally related fungal metabolite fusaric acid, it protects plants better, but lacks cytotoxic, antibacterial, and nematicidal activity. Fruit bodies contain polysaccharides that have been shown in laboratory tests to have antiinflammatory properties.

He was the adopted son of Mohammad Hatta, the first Vice President of Indonesia, whom he called \\"Oom Kacamata\\" (\\"Uncle Eyeglasses\\").  Early life  Alwi was born on November 17, 1927, on Banda Neira, the largest of the Banda Islands in the Moluccas. He first met Mohammad Hatta, as well as Indonesian intellectual Sutan Sjahrir, while Hatta was in internal exile on Banda Neira. Hatta adopted Alwi as his son. As a teenager he participated in the battle for Surabaya, East Java in 1945.  Career  Alwi's early career included working at the Voice of Indonesia radio station in Yogyakarta. He later studied at King‚Äôs College in the UK where he met with future Malaysian political leaders, including Tun Abdul Razak. As a diplomat, Alwi served tenures in several embassies, including Bern, Vienna and Manila. He became disillusioned with Sukarno‚Äôs dictatorial tendencies. He controversially settled in Kuala Lumpur at the height of Indonesia‚Äôs ‚ÄúKonfrontasi‚Äù with Malaysia where he engaged, using a pseudonym, in a broadcast to lambaste Sukarno. Alwi played a role in easing political tensions between Indonesia and Malaysia in the 1960s by approaching then Malaysian prime minister Tun Abdul Razak. In the 1970s, Alwi developed an interest in documentary films when he made a film about Hatta and later made other documentaries. He directed Tanah Gersang (Barren Land) in 1972, Cucu (Grandchild) and a comedy about espionage in 1973.  Later life  Alwi married Anna Marie Mambu, and had four children; Karma Alwi, Mira Alwi and Tanya Alwi and Ramon Alwi.

The show ran from March 2005 to April 2015. Each episode featured three non-serialized segments as well as songs and commercials from fictional sponsors. The show was written by Ben Acker and Ben Blacker; and directed by Aaron Ginsburg. The show's original songs were written by Acker & Blacker with the composer and band leader Andy Paley. History The roots of the Thrilling Adventure Hour began in Blacker's living room where he and Acker held a reading of their film script for a space western called Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars. Struck by the quality of the performances, they decided to launch a stage show with a radio conceit, so that the performers had the luxury of holding scripts in their hands and minimal blocking. The conceit allowed Acker and Blacker to not impose too greatly on their actor friends, while maintaining a regular deadline for generating material, honing their craft and workshopping content in front of an audience. The Thrilling Adventure and Supernatural Suspense Hour began a five-year run at M Bar in Hollywood in March 2005. The original WorkJuice Players were Dave 'Gruber' Allen, Paget Brewster, Craig Cackowski, Mark Gagliardi, Marc Evan Jackson, Hal Lublin, Annie Savage and Paul F. Tompkins. In episode six, Eban Schletter performed live musical accompaniment. Schletter wrote the theme song to \\"Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars\\". In episode seven, the show was joined by Andy Paley. Acker & Blacker and Paley created musical content for the show. Paley arranged Schletter's Sparks Nevada theme and performed themes and songs with his Andy Paley Orchestra, which, at the time, consisted of Jillinda Palmer, Ben Jaffe, and Brittney Westover. In episode eight, the show was joined by Joel Spence, a Foley artist and actor. Soon thereafter, Aaron Ginsburg joined as director. Shortly after that, Samm Levine, Danny Strong, and John DiMaggio joined the cast. Then James Urbaniak, John Ennis and Autumn Reeser. The band Common Rotation made a guest appearance on the show and played afterwards. Common Rotation became a regular staple following the Thrilling Adventure Hour. Marc Evan Jackson hosted Common Rotation's segment, which featured songs performed by Common Rotation as well as WorkJuice players and guest stars. The final performance of The Thrilling Adventure and Supernatural Suspense Hour at M Bar was in January 2010. In March 2010, The Thrilling Adventure Hour shortened its title and started its run at Largo at the Coronet where it continued. Beginning in January 2011, the Thrilling Adventure Hour began podcasting sketches from past performances. In January 2011, the cast took the show on the road for the first time and performed two shows at SF Sketchfest. In October 2011, the Thrilling Adventure Hour podcast joined the network of podcasts released by Chris Hardwick's Nerdist Industries. At SDCC 2014, Thrilling Adventure Hour performed a live crossover show with the cast of Welcome to Night Vale titled \\"Thrilling Adventure Hour & Welcome to Night Vale Crossover\\", which was released for sale on Night Vales Bandcamp and the iTunes music store on October 1, 2014. In 2015, it was announced that after 10 years of live monthly Thrilling Adventure Hour stage performances, the last such performance would be April 11, 2015. Also announced, was that there will be two new monthly comics in the Sparks Nevada and Beyond Belief storylines, starting February 2015. The podcast will continue in the form of audio versions of the comic books. The Thrilling Adventure Hour returned for new episodes in October 2018.

Experiments have involved a wide range of parasites, diseases, and hosts. The effects on humans have been of special interest. The tendency of many parasitic worms to pacify the host's immune response allows them to mollify some diseases, while worsening others.Kamal 2006, pp. 484-491 Immune response hypothesis Mechanisms of immune regulation Extensive research shows that parasitic worms have the ability to deactivate certain immune system cells, leading to a gentler immune response.Cooke 2008, pp. 12-14Melendez 2007, p. 1375Bashir 2002, p. 3284Moreels 2004, p. 99Weinstock 2005, pp. 249-251Osada 2010, pp. 2-3Correale 2007, pp. 98-99 Often, such a response is beneficial to both parasite and host, according to Professor of Medical Microbiology Graham Rook of University College London.Rook 2008, pp. 3-4 This immune \\"relaxation\\" is incorporated throughout the immune system, decreasing immune responses against harmless allergens, gut flora, and the body itself. Importance of T helper cells in an immune response: T helper cells recognize antigens from antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and then release cytokines and activate other immune cells. Parasitic worms influence what kinds of T helper cells are activated. In the past, helminths were thought to simply suppress T-helper Type 1 (Th1) cells while inducing T-helper Type 2 (Th2) cells. Rook points out that this hypothesis would only explain the regulatory effects of parasitic worms on autoimmune diseases caused by Th1 cells.Rook 2008, pp. 4-5 However, helminths also regulate Th2-caused diseases, such as allergy and asthma. Professor Rook postulates that different parasitic worms suppress different Th types, but always in favor of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Professor Rook explains that these regulatory T cells release interleukins that fight inflammation. In the Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Dr. Osada et al. note that macrophages induced by Treg cells fight not only the parasitic disease, but also resist the immune system's response to allergens and the body.Osada 2010, pp. 1-2 According to Dr. Hopkin, the author of a 2009 Parasite Immunology article on asthma and parasitic worms, other immunoregulatory mechanisms are also activated, including Mast cells, eosinophils, and cytokines that invoke a strong immunoglobulin E (IgE) response.Hopkin 2009, pp. 267-270 All these fight a hyperactive immune response, reduce the inflammation throughout the body, and thus lead to less severe autoimmune diseases. Dr. Osada et al. state that because parasitic worms may and often do consist of allergens themselves, the degree to which they pacify or agitate the immune response against allergens is a balance of their regulating effects and their allergenic components. Therefore, depending on both of these variables, some parasitic worms may worsen allergies. In their Parasite Immunology article on worms and viral infections, Dr. Kamal et al. explain why some parasitic worms aggravate the immune response.Kamal 2006, pp. 483-484 Because parasitic worms often induce Th2 cells and lead to suppressed Th1 cells, problems arise when Th1 cells are needed. Such cases occur with viral diseases. Several examples of viral infections worsened by parasitic worms are described below. Evolutionary theory The positive effects of parasitic worms are theorized to be a result of millions of years of evolution, when humans and human ancestors would have been constantly inhabited by parasitic worms. In the academic journal EMBO Reports, Dr. Rook says that such helminths \\"are all either things that really do us no harm, or things where the immune system is forced to give in and avoid a fight because it's just a waste of time.Hadley 2004, p. 1124\\" In the scientific journal Immunology, Rook states that, because parasitic worms were almost always present, the human immune system developed a way to treat them that didn't cause tissue damage. The immune system extends this response to its treatments of self-antigens, softening reactions against allergens, the body, and digestive microorganisms.Hadley 2004, pp. 1122-1124 As the worms developed ways of triggering a beneficial immune response, humans came to rely on parasitic interaction to help regulate their immune systems. As developed countries advanced in technology, medicine, and sanitation, parasitic worms were mostly eradicated in those countries, according to Dr. Weinstock in the medical journal GUT.Weinstock 2004, p. 7 Because these events took place very recently on the evolutionary timeline and humans have progressed much faster technologically than genetically, the human immune system has not yet adapted to the absence of internal worms. This theory attempts to explain the rapid increase in allergies and asthma in the last century in the developed world, as well as the relative absence of autoimmune diseases in the developing world, where parasites are more common. Comparison with the hygiene hypothesis The Hygiene hypothesis postulates that decreasing exposure to pathogens and other microorganisms results in an increase of autoimmune diseases, according to Dr. Rook. This theory and the theory that certain parasitic worms pacify the immune response are similar in that both theories attribute the recent rise of autoimmune diseases to the decreased levels of pathogens in developed countries. However, the Hygiene Hypothesis claims that the absence of pathogenic organisms in general has led to this.Hadley 2004, pp. 1122-1123 In contrast, the parasitic worm theory only analyzes helminths, and specifically ones found to have a regulating effect. Effects of parasitic worms Positive effects Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the body's pancreatic beta cells. In an experiment with mice, infection with parasitic worms or helminth-products generally inhibited the spontaneous development of T1D, according to Dr. Anne Cook in the journal Immunology. However, results varied among the different species of parasitic worms. Some helminth-products, like a protein of the nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae, didn't have any effect. Another infectious agent, Salmonella typhimurium was successful even when administered late in the development of T1D. Elephantiasis, a disease caused by filarial nematodes Allergy and asthma According to Dr. Hopkin, asthma involves atopic allergy, which in turn involves the release of mediators that induce inflammation. In 2007, Dr. Melendez and his associates studied filarial nematodes and ES-62, a protein that nematodes secrete in their host. They discovered that pure ES-62 prevents the release of allergenic inflammatory mediators in mice, resulting in weaker allergic and asthmatic symptoms. In the Journal of Immunology, Dr. Bashir et al. describe their experimental findings that an allergic response against peanuts is inhibited in mice infected with an intestinal parasite. Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease involving the inflammation of mucus. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are both types of IBD. In the medical journal GUT, Dr. Moreels et al. describe their experiments on induced colitis in rats. They found that infecting the rats with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni resulted in alleviated colitis effects. According to Dr. Weinstock, human patients of UC or CD improve when infected with the parasitic worm whipworm. Schistosoma mansani, commonly known as the blood fluke Arthritis In 2003, Dr. Iain McInnes et al. found that arthritic-induced mice experienced less inflammation and other arthritic effects when infected with ES-62, a protein derived from filarial nematodes, a kind of parasitic worm.McInnes 2003, pp. 2127-2129 Similarly, in the International Journal for Parasitology, Dr. Osada et al. published their experimental findings that arthritis-induced mice infected with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni had down-regulated immune systems.Osada 2008, p. 457 This led to resistance to arthritis. Multiple sclerosis In 2007, Dr. Jorge Correale et al. studied the effects of parasitic infection on multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Correale evaluated several MS patients infected with parasites, comparable MS patients without parasites, and similar healthy subjects over the course of 4.6 years. During the study, the MS patients that were infected with parasites experienced far less effects of MS than the non-infected MS patients. Negative effects Vaccination In the journal Parasite Immunulogy, Dr. Kamal et al. explains that parasitic worms often weaken the immune system's ability to effectively respond to a vaccine because such worms induce a Th2-based immune response that is less responsive than normal to antigens.Kamal 2006, pp. 484-485 This is a major concern in developing countries where parasitic worms and the need for vaccinations exist in large number. It may explain why vaccines are often ineffective in developing countries. Hepatitis The human whipworm, a parasitic worm Because Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the parasitic worm Schistosoma (the bloodfluke) are relatively common in developing countries, there are many cases where both are present in the human body.Kamal 2006, pp. 485-487 According to Dr. Kamal, bloodflukes have been adequately shown to worsen HCV. Dr. Kamal explains that, in order to maintain an immune response against HCV, patients must sustain a certain level of CD4+ T-cells. However, the presence of bloodflukes closely and negatively correlates to the presence of CD4+ T-cells, and so a much higher percentage of those infected with bloodflukes are unable to combat HCV effectively and develop chronic HCV. Parasitic effects of Hepatitis B virus, however, are contested‚Äîsome studies show little association, while others show exacerbation of the disease.Kamal 2006, pp. 487-489 HIV Because the two diseases are abundant in developing countries, there are many patients with both HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) and parasites, and specifically bloodflukes.Kamal 2006, pp. 489-491 In his article, Dr. Kamal relates the findings that those infected with parasites are more likely to be infected by HIV. However, it is disputed whether or not the viral infection is more severe because of the parasites. Tuberculosis According to Dr. Kamal, the human immune system needs Th1 cells to effectively fight TB.Kamal 2006, p. 485 Since the immune system often responds to parasitic worms by inhibiting Th1 cells, parasitic worms generally worsen tuberculosis. In fact, Tuberculosis patients who receive successful parasitic therapy experience major improvement. Malaria Malaria distribution map. Most countries with a high distribution of malaria also have a high distribution of parasitic worm infections. In 2004, Dr. Sokhna et al. performed a study of Senegalese children.Sokhna 2004, p. 43 Those infected with blood flukes had significantly higher rates of malaria attacks than those who were not. Furthermore, children with the highest counts of blood flukes also had the most malaria attacks. Based on this study, Dr. Hartgers et al. drew a \\"cautious conclusion\\" that helminths make humans more susceptible to contracting malaria and experiencing some of its lighter symptoms, while actually protecting them from the worst symptoms.Hartgers 2006, p. 502-503 Hartgers reasons that a Th2-skewed immune system resulting from helminth infection would lower the immune system's ability to counter an initial malarial infection. However, it would also prevent a hyperimmune response resulting in severe inflammation, reducing morbidity and pathology.

It is a rare plant with a ROTAP rating of 2VC-t. There are two sub-species; arborescens is a small hairless shrub or tree up to 13 metres (45 ft) tall with a stem diameter up to 40 cm (16 in), and sub-species rupestris grows only to 6 metres (20 ft), with a stem diameter up to 17 cm (7 in). Description Corynocarpus rupestris is a small, dense, bushy tree or tall shrub of 2‚Äì5 m, or a leafy canopy tree that grows to a height of 13 m with erect or spreading branches. As a shrub, its trunk is usually multi-stemmed and has a smooth, semi-corky bark with broad, shallow fissures. Branchlets with prominent scars form scale leaves. The thick, stiff, glossy, leathery, and smooth leaves are dark green above and paler beneath, 5‚Äì18 cm long and 3‚Äì7 cm wide. Leaves usually alternate in three whorls on juvenile plants and are oval, teardrop-shaped, or lance-shaped. The scale leaves of 2‚Äì3 mm long are glossy. Leaves on young plants or on the lower parts of adult plants are so strongly and sharply toothed that they appear to be of a different species. Some intermediate leaves are usually present. Leaves have an apex which ends in a stiff, bristle-like point, and their base extends downward. The margins of leaves are slightly recurved, undulate, and are entire except for spiny teeth in juveniles. In winter and spring (August to November in Australia), Corynocarpus rupestris produces a stout, erect cluster 10‚Äì21 cm long of tiny flowers with petioles which are greenish-cream, white, off-white or pale yellow, and 10‚Äì15 mm long. The individual flowers are 4‚Äì5 mm in diameter with petals 2.4-3.5 mm long. The pedestals are usually 3‚Äì5 mm long, and the sepals are 2‚Äì4 mm long. The fruit is a rounded or spherical drupe, red and glossy with a diameter of 1‚Äì4 cm, ending in a tiny point in some sub-species, containing a single kernel with a seed. The fruit ripens in summer and autumn (January to April in Australia), and the seed dispersion is mostly the result of scattering by columbiform birds. Habitat and ecology Corynocarpus rupestris' habitat consists of dry rainforest on steep basalt boulder slopes where soil is scarce but relatively high in nutrients and very well-drained. Fire is generally excluded by the rocky terrain and absence of ground litter. With the drying of Australia, the laurel forests habitat gradually retreated, and laurel forests were replaced by the more drought- tolerant sclerophyll plant communities familiar today. Corynocarpus rupestris grows well in limy soils where there is shelter due to its late flowering. Growth as a multi-stemmed shrub rather than a tree is an adaptation to this new habitat. Corynocarpus rupestris subsp. rupestris is naturally adapted to dry summers, although it also grows well in cool, wet summers. Corynocarpus rupestris is a typical representative of the laurel forest ecoregion. Subspecies * C. rupestris subsp. rupestris, Glenugie Karaka. * C. rupestris subsp. arborescens, Southern Corynocarpus. Glenugie Karaka can be distinguished from C. rupestris subsp. arborescens by its longer inflorescences, which are 10‚Äì21 cm long, and by its shorter height, as Southern Corynocarpus grows to 12 m height.  Naming  \\"Glenugie\\" comes from the small mountain where sub-species rupestris was collected: Glenugie Peak. \\"Karaka\\" is a Maori name from the related New Zealand species Corynocarpus laevigatus. The generic name Corynocarpus means a club fruit, referring to the club-shaped fruit of other species in the genus.

One of the country's biggest stars during the 1970s, he is a 3-time NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Champion and a former NWA Australia Heavyweight Champion. He also teamed with Don Kent in the Puerto Rico-based World Wrestling Council as the fourth incarnation of The Fabulous Kangaroos and together twice won the WWC North American Tag Team Championship in 1981. During his professional career, Ashby and Al Hobman trained several wrestlers out of Koolman's Gym in Wellington, most notably, Jock Ruddock and Butch Miller. Ashby is credited for first introducing Luke Williams to pro wrestling and who later joined Miller to form The Sheepherders. He was one of several veterans involved in Kiwi Pro Wrestling, one of the three major companies in New Zealand, and was inducted into KPW's New Zealand Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2009, Ashby was ranked #6 in a top ten list of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers by Fight Times Magazine. Career Early career in Australia Brian Ashby debuted in the early 1960s. He spent some time in Australia early in his career, competing under his real name, and faced Dory Funk, Jr. in Melbourne and Brisbane in late-April 1965; he lost to Funk on both occasions. He briefly held the NWA Australian Heavyweight Championship around this time before losing the title to Larry O'Dea in Sydney on 7 May 1965. Like many New Zealand wrestlers of the period, Ashby became an established journeyman wrestler by the end of the decade and was a very big favourite in Singapore and Malaysia. He was also one of the earliest to wrestle in North America alongside fellow New Zealanders such as Pat O'Connor, Abe Jacobs, John da Silva, Steve Rickard and Robert Bruce. Return to New Zealand A rising star in Rickard's All Star-Pro Wrestling, he and Al Hobman trained several wrestlers at the famous Koolman's Gym in Wellington including Jock Ruddock and Butch Miller among others. Luke Williams, who would later go on to team with Miller as The Sheepherders, was also brought into the business by Ashby. Ashby was his first tag partner and the two went on several overseas tours together early in Williams career. In time, Ashby became New Zealand's most popular \\"big man\\" and enjoyed immense fame in his native country during the 1970s. In 1972, Ashby encountered Andr√© the Giant during the French wrestler's tour. He and \\"Brutal\\" Bob Miller first faced Andre and Jock Ruddock at a near sold-out show at the YMCA stadium in Palmerston North on 22 February 1972. At one point in the match, Andre lifted the eighteen stone Ashby into the air, sat him on top of a ringpost and patted his cheek \\"as one would a naughty boy\\". In the last moments of the match, according to the Manawatu Standard, Ashby and his partner attempted to attack Andre together, but \\"they paid dearly for this, as [Andre] whipped atomic drops on both of them and the bout was all over\\". Ashby also wrestled Andre in singles matches and later told the press \\"thank goodness he leaves the country soon. If he stays much longer there will be no professional wrestlers left.\\" Ashby had memorable bouts with other foreign wrestlers especially in his later appearances on On the Mat.Afi, Siva. Reign of Fire: My Testimony from the Depths of Hell I Rose into the Majesty of God Almighty. Lulu.com (pg. 20) According to wrestling historian Steve Yohe, Ashby may have wrestled as the masked wrestler Dr. X who teamed with The Destroyer in Auckland in 1973. In 1977, he was allied with Bruiser Brodie during his brief stint in All Star-Pro Wrestling; he and Brodie, with Bugs McGraw, lost to Siva Afi, Kung Fu Lee and Kevin Martin in Auckland on 22 August. A month later in Wellington, he and Brodie teamed with King Curtis Iaukea to beat Mark Lewin, Siva Afi and Samoan Joe on 12 September 1977. Ashby continued wrestling internationally as well. While touring All- Japan Pro Wrestling in 1979, he joined Kintaro Ohki and Carlos Colon in a 6-man tag team match against Giant Baba, Tiger Toguchi and Akihisa Takachiho. That same month, he was part of the AJPW Black Power series in which he wrestled Akio Sato, Motoshi Okuma, Great Kojika, Rocky Hata and Tiger Toguchi. Don Kent and The Fabulous Kangaroos In 1981, Ashby agreed to team with Don Kent as the fourth incarnation of The Fabulous Kangaroos for a tour of Puerto Rico with the World Wrestling Council. Managed by Al Costello, who asked Kent to team with Ashby, the team successfully captured the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco in San Juan on 22 October 1981. They held the titles for a little over a month before losing the belts to Invader I and Super Gladiator on 23 November, but won them back in Bayam√≥n two weeks later. After another two months as champions Ashby and Kent finally dropped the titles back to Invader I and Super Gladiator on 26 January 1982, and went their separate ways at the end of the tour. Later career and retirement Ashby returned to New Zealand where he spent the rest of his career working for Rickard and other promoters. In 1985, he won a championship tournament to claim the then vacant NWA New Zealand Heavyweight Championship. He dominated the title during the mid-to late 1980s, feuding over the title with Johnny Garcia, before finally losing the championship to A.J. Freeley on 22 November 1992. All Star-Pro Wrestling closed shortly afterwards, and with the general decline of professional wrestling in New Zealand, Ashby decided to retire. Recent years On 24 January 2004, Ashby made his first public appearance in over 12 years when he and other veteran New Zealand wrestlers attended a \\"legends reunion\\" show at Petone. Ashby one of the first such legends to become involved in the newer promotions which began to emerge during the 21st century, particularly, with Kiwi Pro Wrestling in 2006. He not only attended live events but was also inducted into its New Zealand Wrestling Hall of Fame, along with Bob Crozier, Al Hobman and Rip Morgan, by KPW Commissioner Butch Miller on 8 December 2006; he also made a guest appearance at a sold out Impact Pro Wrestling show in Auckland on 15 March 2007. On 31 October 2008, Ashby appeared with Kurt Hobman, Steve Rickard, Juno Huia, Cowboy Billy Wright, Ricky Wallace and Bob Crozier at the KPW supercard \\"Halloween Howl 3\\" held in Wellington High School to pay tribute to Al Hobman who had died the previous month. In 2009, was ranked #6 in a top ten list of New Zealand's greatest wrestlers by Fight Times Magazine.

It is located mid-block adjoining the Exchange Building. It was built by the Bank of California (predecessor to the Union Bank of California) in 1924 and has been continually used as a bank ever since. It housed the offices for the Bank of California until 1973 when a new building, the Union Bank of California Center was built at the corner of 4th and Madison Streets. Ironically, this newer, larger building is no longer used as a bank and instead is occupied by a Bartell Drugs store. The original Bank of California Building was retained as a branch office until being sold to the Puget Sound Mutual Savings Bank in 1982 which was headquartered in the building until 1993 when through a series of mergers and acquisitions the bank became a branch of Key Bank, which it remains to present day. The Building is a rectangular two Story plus basement Reinforced concrete building faced with terra cotta meant to imitate stone. It features a sky-lit banking room that spans all floors and includes a mezzanine. It was designed in a \\"strict Italian Renaissance\\" style typical of many banks in the 1920s by John Graham & Company, one of Seattle's most prominent architectural firms. Graham's firm under his predecessor, John Graham, Jr., would also design the building's aforementioned replacement in 1973.

Accessed 6 December 2010. History The Bank of California, organized in San Francisco in 1864, came to Seattle in 1905 with the acquisition of the London and San Francisco Bank who had branches in Seattle, Tacoma and Portland, Oregon. The Bank of California became a national bank in 1910 and soon was one of the biggest banks west of the Mississippi River. By the early 1920s the bank had outgrown its small office at the Northwest corner of 2nd Avenue and Columbia Street. In May 1923 the bank purchased the Epler Block located two doors north of their own from the Epler Estate for $160,000 with the intention of building a new bank building on the site.\\"New Bank Building to Go Up - Epler Block Changes Hands\\" Seattle Times 8 May 1923.

Pg. 8. The bank chose the John Graham firm to design a two-story plus mezzanine concrete structure with a terra cotta facade that would cost around $200,000 but would actually cost $50,000 more. A completed architectural sketch of the building was published in the Seattle Times on September 25, 1923.\\"Graphic-Fiction Page\\" Seattle Times 25 Sept. 1923. A preliminary and apparently innovative concept hatched during the building's designing was to incorporate customer parking in the building's basement.

Construction began in early 1924 and by May of that year, the concrete structure was complete. The building officially opened to the public on August 25, 1924. The bank continued to expand by opening offices in the adjoining Exchange Building and constructing a parking garage to the south. By the late 1960s, they were ready to expand and set out to construct the Union Bank of California Center, which covered an entire city block bound by Madison, Marion, Fourth and Fifth Avenues and would contain over of space for the bank, much more than the old building had.Lane, Polly \\"Bank of California to Build Downtown Office Building.\\" Seattle Times 1 Jul. 1970.

Description The building in 2008, before the modern entrance canopy was removed Exterior The wide Second Avenue facade of the Bank is clad in gray glazed terra cotta meant to imitate stone. The facade is composed of large windows framed by four free standing Roman ionic columns with two related pilasters, the center space being slightly spread to allow for the entrance doors, capped with a large arched pediment. The entablature is crowned by an attic forming the fourth floor. The design follows the Ionic order and includes an architrave and frieze which once bore the name of the bank but is now bare. Above the fourth floor is a smaller cornice topped with a pediment bearing the building's date of construction. Interior The main feature of the bank was the 60 by main banking room with a high rotunda ceiling. The interior was described by The Seattle Times in an August, 1924 article: The marble used for the counters and floors was variegated Escolette imported from France while woodwork was made of polished black walnut. Large clocks, with dials of escolette were centered in balcony grill work at each end of the main lobby. Offices were located on each balcony. The basement housed the vaults and recreation rooms for employees while the fourth floor contained offices and a large club room for employees.\\"Bank Builds New Home\\" Seattle Times 6 Jul. 1924.

Although its edict had never been officially recognized, the county did not officially rescind its act of secession until 1986. Background At the time of the secession from the Union, Tennessee's Scott County listed only 61 slaves in residence. It was one of only two counties in the entire state with fewer than 100 slaves. Tennessee was the last state to secede from the Union, in part due to the huge divide in resources and political power between the state's three divisions. East Tennessee, of which Scott County was a part, was less dependent on slavery than Middle and West Tennessee. Therefore, there was little incentive for the residents of the eastern part of the state to go to war to preserve that economic institution. The people of East Tennessee largely favored an intact Union and wanted minimal government interference in their lives.Remembering Scott's Defiant Independence; article; Independent Herald; on-line web-page; accessed July 18, 2020. They held a generally dis-favorable view of the rest of the state whose wealthy business men and plantation owners wielded political and economic power over the entire state. History In a June 8, 1861 speech delivered on the steps of the Huntsville courthouse by Senator (and future president) Andrew Johnson‚Äîa Democrat and himself a slave holder‚Äîhe stated, \\"...it is not the free men of the north that [secessionists] are fearing most, but the free men of the South...\\" Four days later, the people of Scott county voted overwhelmingly (541‚Äì19) against Tennessee's referendum on secession from the Union, and later that year the county court voted to approve the Scott County General Assembly's unanimous resolution approving of its own secession from Tennessee. The resolution allowed the immediate formation of the \\"Independent State of Scott,\\" which established an enclave community whose sympathies remained strongly loyal to the Union throughout, and following, the war. Governor's response In response to the State of Scott proclamation of independence, Tennessee Governor Isham Harris quickly gathered 1700 soldiers to march to Huntsville and put down the \\"rebellion.\\" Facing extreme resistance, however, the troops were forced to retreat before reaching the capital. Limited fighting Because the area was of little strategic value, the mountainous and somewhat isolated State of Scott was not the site of any fighting on a major scale during the Civil War, with the exception of the minor Battle of Huntsville, fought on August 13, 1862.Scott County, Tennessee; Battle of Huntsville; Tennessee GenWeb on-line; document: Report of Col. William Clift, Seventh Tennessee Infantry, including operations of his command in East Tennessee, July 1-October 31; retrieved July 18, 2020 Facing a force of approximately 2,000 troops, and suffering from high levels of desertion and battle attrition, Union commander, Colonel William Clift, was forced from the town and retreated into the back woods with about 20 remaining men. Following Huntsville, Clift's reconstituted but rag-tag regiment fought more as a guerrilla unit for much of the rest of the year. The area continued to be torn for some time by guerrilla warfare, bushwhacking, and skirmishing, which often took on a brutally violent and vicious nature, often between neighbors. Male residents from the area did, however, become the main source of volunteers for the Union‚Äôs 7th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. Aftermath Ulysses S. Grant received over 90% of the vote in Scott County during both the 1868 United States presidential election and the 1872 United States presidential election. The county remained strongly Republican and pro- union well into the 20th century. The proclamation of secession was finally repealed by Scott County in 1986. At the same time, the county petitioned the state of Tennessee for readmission, which was ceremonially granted, even though its secession had not been recognized by the state‚Äînor the federal governments of either the Union or the Confederacy.History of Scott County, Tennessee.

A key feature of the DNA replication mechanism in eukaryotes is that it is designed to replicate relatively large genomes rapidly and with high fidelity. Replication is initiated at multiple origins of replication on multiple chromosomes simultaneously so that the duration of S phase is not limited by the total amount of DNA. This flexibility in genome size comes at a cost: there has to be a high-fidelity control system that coordinates multiple replication origins so that they are activated only once during each S phase. If this were not the case, daughter cells might inherit an excessive amount of any DNA sequence, which could lead to many harmful effects.  The replication origin  Replication in eukaryotes begins at replication origins, where complexes of initiator proteins bind and unwind the helix. In eukaryotes, it is still unclear what exact combinations of DNA sequence, chromatin structure, and other factors define these sites. The relative contribution of these factors varies between organisms. Yeast origins are defined primarily by DNA sequence motifs, while origin locations in other organisms seem to be defined by local chromatin structure. Yeast Origins in budding yeast are defined by the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a short stretch of DNA (100-200 bp) that can initiate replication when transferred to any sequence of DNA. The ARS contains several specific sequence elements. One of these is the A element (ACS), an 11 bp consensus sequence rich in adenines and thymines that is essential for initiation. Single base-pair mutations in the ACS can abolish initiation activity. The ORC, a component of the initiation complex, binds the ACS in vivo throughout the cell cycle, and in vitro in an ATP dependent manner. When a few of these sequences are deleted, DNA is still copied from other intact origins, but when many are deleted, chromosome replication slows down dramatically. Still, presence of an ACS sequence is not sufficient to identify an origin of replication. Only about 30% of ACS sequences present in the genome are the sites of initiation activity. Origins in fission yeast contain long stretches of DNA rich in thymines and adenines that are important for origin function, but do not exhibit strong sequence similarity. Animals In animals, no highly conserved sequence elements have been found to direct origin activity, and it has proved difficult to identify common features of replication origins. At some loci, initiation occurs within small, relatively definable stretches of DNA, while at others, larger initiation zones of 10‚Äì50 kb seem to direct origin activity. At the sequence level, AT rich elements and CpG islands have been found at origins, but their importance or role is not yet clear. At the level of DNA structure, bent DNA and loop formation have been identified as origin features. Features identified at the chromatin level include nucleosome free regions, histone acetylation and DNAse sensitive sites. The pre-replication complex Pre-RC assembly involves the assembly of the ORC subunits, Cdc6 and Cdt1 and the Mcm2-7 complex Before DNA replication can start, the pre-replicative complex assembles at origins to load helicase onto DNA. The complex assembles in late mitosis and early G1. Assembly of these pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) is regulated in a manner that coordinates DNA replication with the cell cycle. Components of the pre-RC The ORC The ORC is a six subunit complex that binds DNA and provides a site on the chromosome where additional replication factors can assemble. It was identified in S. cerevisiae by its ability to bind the conserved A and B1 elements of yeast origins. It is a conserved feature of the replication system in Eukaryotes. Studies in Drosophila showed that recessive lethal mutations in multiple drosophila ORC subunits reduces the amount of BrdU (a marker of active replication), incorporated. Studies in Xenopus extracts show that immuno-depletion of ORC subunits inhibits DNA replication of Xenopus sperm nuclei. In some organisms, the ORC appears to associate with chromatin throughout the cell cycle, but in others it dissociates at specific stages of the cell cycle.  Cdc6 and Cdt1  Cdc6 and Cdt1 assemble on the ORC and recruit the Mcm proteins. Homologs for these two S. cerevisiae proteins have been found in all eukaryotes. Studies have shown that these proteins are necessary for DNA replication. Mutations in S. pombe cdt1 blocked DNA replication.  The Mcm Complex  Mcm 2-7 form a six-subunit complex and is thought to have helicase activity. Deletion of any single subunit of the complex has a lethal phenotype in yeast. Studies in Xenopus revealed the Mcm2-7 complex is a critical component of DNA replication machinery. Inactivation of temperature sensitive mutants of any of the Mcm proteins in \\"S. cerevisiae\\" caused DNA replication to halt if inactivation occurred during S phase, and prevented initiation of replication if inactivation occurred earlier. Although biochemical data support the hypothesis that the Mcm complex is a helicase, helicase activity was not detected in all species, and some studies suggest that some of the mcm subunits act together as the helicase, while other subunits act as inhibitors of this activity. If this is true, activation of the Mcm complex probably involves rearrangement of the subunits. Regulation of pre-RC complex assembly pre-RC Assembly limited to late M and early G1 A two-step mechanism ensures that DNA is replicated only once per cycle. Assembly of the pre-RC complex (licensing) is limited to late mitosis and early G1 because it can occur only when CDK activity is low, and APC activity is high. Origin firing occurs only in S phase, when the APC is inactivated, and CDKs are activated. Yeast In budding yeast, CDK is the key regulator of pre-RC assembly. Evidence for this is that inactivation of CDKs in cells arrested in G2/M or in S phase drives reassembly of pre-RCs. CDK acts by inhibiting the individual components of the pre-RC. CDK phosphorylates Cdc6 to mark it for degradation by the SCF in late G1 and early S phase. CDK also induces export of Mcm complexes and Cdt1 from the nucleus. Evidence that CDKs regulate the localization of Mcm2-7 this is that inactivation of CDKs in nocodozole arrested cells induced accumulation of Mcm2-7 in the nucleus. Cdt1 is also exported because it binds to the Mcm complex. In Mcm depleted cells, cdt1 did not accumulate in the nucleus. Conversely, when an NLS (nuclear localization signal) was attached to Mcm7, Mcm2-7 and Cdt1 were always found in the nucleus. Export of Mcm from the nucleus prevents loading of new Mcm complexes but does not affect the complexes that have already been loaded onto the DNA. CDK also phosphorylates ORC proteins. It has been suggested that phosphorylation affects the ability of the ORC to bind other components of the pre-RC. To get substantial re-replication of DNA, regulation of all three components, Cdc6, Mcm2-7 and the ORC has to be prevented. Having multiple mechanisms to prevent re-replication is beneficial because it the regulatory network continues to function even if one of the components fails. Animals Geminin is an important inhibitor of pre-Rc assembly is metazoan cells. Geminin was identified in a screen for APC/C substrates in Xenopus. Studies have shown that Geminin prevents pre_RC assembly by binding to cdt1 and preventing its association with the pre-RC. Since geminin is degraded by the APC/C, pre-Rc assembly can proceed only when APC/C activity is high, which occurs in G1. The importance of CDKs in preventing re-licensing in metazoan cells is still unclear. Some studies have showed that under some conditions, CDKs can also promote licensing. In G0 mammalian cells, APC mediated degradation of Cdc6 prevents licensing. However, when the cells transition into a proliferative state, CDK phosphorylates Cdc6 to stabilizes it and allow it to accumulate and bind to origins before licensing inhibitors such as geminin accumulate. Activation of replication origins Regulation of Cdc7 activity throughout the cell cycle While pre-RC complexes mark potential sites for origin activation, further proteins and complexes must assemble at these sites to activate replication (origin firing). The following events must occur in order to activate the origin: the DNA helix has to open, the helicase must be activated, and DNA polymerases and the rest of the replicative machinery have to load onto the DNA. These events depend on the assembly of several proteins to form the pre-initiation complex at the replication origins loaded with pre-replicative complexes. Assembly of the pre-initiation complex depends on the activities of S-Cdks and the protein kinase Cdc7. The pre-initiation complex activates the Mcm helicase and recruits DNA polymerase. When the cell commits to a new cell cycle, after passing through the Start checkpoint, G1 and G1/S cyclin CDK complexes are activated. These activate the expression of the replicative machinery and of S-Cdk cylin complexes. S-Cdks and G1/S Cdks act to activate replication origins. At the same time, S-Cdks suppress formation of new pre-RCs during S phase, G2 and early M, when S cyclin levels remains high. Cdc7 is activated in late G1 and is required throughout S phase for origin firing. Mutations in this protein in budding yeast, and in its homolog in fission yeast block initiation of replication. Cdc7 is highly conserved ‚Äì related proteins have been identified in frogs and humans. DNA replication is inhibited when Cdc7 homologs are inhibited with antibodies in frog or human cells. It is not known whether CDKs and Cdc7 just regulate protein assembly at origins, or whether they directly activate components of the pre-initiation complex. Role of CdK In S. cerevisiae, the S cyclins Clb5 and Clb6 play and important role in initiating replication. In frog embryos, cyclin E-Cdk2 is primarily responsible for activating origins. Removal of cyclin E with antibodies blocks replication. Cyclin E-CDk2 is also important in Drosophila. Levels of cyclin E rise during S phase and activate Cdk2. Role of Cdc7 Cdc7 levels remain relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, but its activity varies. Its activity is low in G1, increases in late G1, and remains high till late mitosis. Dbf4 is the key regulator of Cdc7 activity ‚Äì association Cdc7 with Dbf4 activates its kinase activity. In a similar manner to cyclin levels, dbf4 levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. In vitro biochemical studies have shown that Cdc7-Dbf4 phosphorylates individual components of the Mcm complex. It also seems to be involved in the recruitment of Cdc45 to chromatin at the time of initiation. In Xenopus eggs, Cdc45 has been shown to interact with DNA polymerase Œ±, and in yeast, mutations in Cdc45 prevent assembly of DNA pol Œ± at origins, suggesting that Cdc45 recruits DNA pol Œ± to chromatin in a Cdc7/Dbf4 dependent manner.

He published the Athenae Britannicae in 1716. Biography Davies was a native of Whiteford, near Holywell in Flintshire, Wales. His parents George and Elizabeth Davies lived in Tre'r Abbot. Isaac D'Israeli said his biography was quite unknown. He was educated at the English Jesuit College in Rome, and was made a Roman Catholic priest on 17 April 1688. He left Rome on 15 October 1688 to work with the Jesuits in Wales, but soon converted to Protestantism, and in 1705 published an explanation (apologia) for his surprising conversion in The Recantation of Mr Pollett, A Roman priest. The preface to one of his books describes him as \\"a gentleman of the Inns of Court\\". He was a learned and erudite scholar, but eccentric to the verge of insanity. In 1715, he published the first volume of his Athenae Britannicae, a critical history of pamphlets called Icon Libellorum. It was described as \\"a queer production, but cram full of curious information\\". The Libellorum included a letter written in French and a Latin ode to Robert Harley, first Earl of Oxford. Davies became a mendicant scholar, selling his own books. He would visit the house of a potential patron and send in a bundle of his books, with perhaps an ode to the recipient, in the hope of receiving a gift in return. He was often rejected or insulted when trying to obtain payment or return of his work. By 1812, his work was described as extremely rare.

Developed for television by Frank Darabont, who wrote or co-wrote four of the season's six episodes and directed the pilot episode, \\"Days Gone Bye\\", the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It was executive produced by Darabont, Kirkman, David Alpert, Charles H. Eglee, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Darabont assuming the role of showrunner. The season received very positive reviews by critics. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series ‚Äì Drama at the 68th Golden Globe Awards and received nominations for the 63rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in several categories, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special. The pilot episode received 5.35 million viewers, and the finale garnered six million viewers, including four million viewers among adults ages 18‚Äì49, making it the most viewed basic cable drama series at that time. Based on its reception, AMC renewed the series for a second season consisting of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011. This season adapts material from issues #1‚Äì6 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic character Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), who awakens from a coma, after being shot, in a post-apocalyptic world filled with flesh- eating zombies, dubbed \\"walkers\\". After befriending Morgan Jones (Lennie James), Rick sets out to find his family and discover the origins of the walker virus. Production Conception A set-up of The Walking Dead at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2010 Robert Kirkman, who created the comic book series in 2003, says he had considered the idea of a Walking Dead television series, but never actively pursued it. \\"I certainly wanted it to happen, just because I knew it would be good for the book... I'm certainly not against adaptations, like some creators.\\" When Frank Darabont became interested in adapting the comic books for television, Kirkman said it was \\"extremely flattering\\" and went on to say that, \\"He definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he's adapting it. It's an extreme validation of the work... Never in a million years could I have thought that if Walking Dead were to ever be adapted that everything would be going this well. I think that that's all because of Frank.\\" Darabont himself had been a fan of the zombie genre since seeing George A. Romero's 1968 film Night of the Living Dead when he was fourteen years old. \\"\\"Night of the Living Dead\\" had this weird vibe that was almost - it was like pornography... It had this marvelously attractive, disreputable draw... I loved it immediately.\\" Darabont recalls walking into a comic book store in Burbank, California and seeing The Walking Dead on the shelf in 2005. \\"Being that I've always had \\"the love of zombies genre,\\" I of course grabbed it, took it home and read it, and immediately started pursuing the rights to it. I thought it would make a great TV show... I loved the idea of an extended, ongoing, serialized dramatic presentation set in the zombie apocalypse.\\" He described the process of developing the series and getting it set up at a network as \\"four years of frustration,\\" and credits executive producer Gale Anne Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. \\"I can't remember what the hell prompted her to read it [the script], but she said, \\"Wow, I really love this pilot you wrote. What are you doing with it?\\" I said I'd been trying to set it up forever... She said \\"I think AMC might be the place to take this.\\" She did, and then bam! They were immediately interested. I had to credit Gale, her insight into marrying the material and the buyer.\\" Writing Darabont's original pilot script was split in half and embellished, making the first two episodes instead of one, \\"...just to slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation.\\" To write the remaining episodes of the season, Darabont recruited Charles H. Eglee, Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom he had worked with while directing an episode of The Shield. Jack LoGiudice also joined the writing team, along with Robert Kirkman, also an executive producer. \\"I have the best of both worlds,\\" says Kirkman. \\"It was a lot of fun writing Episode 104, and I'm hoping if it continues into Season 2, I'll be able to write more episodes.\\" Filming Principal photography for the pilot episode, \\"Days Gone Bye\\", began on May 15, 2010 with the subsequent five episodes beginning filming a few weeks later on June 2. The first season was filmed in and around Atlanta, Georgia where the episodes were primarily set. Cast Amy, Shane, Glenn, Carl, Lori, Rick, Dale, and Andrea Main cast The first season features seven actors receiving opening credits billing: * Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes, the series' protagonist and former sheriff's deputy from King County, Georgia, who awakens from a coma into the apocalypse. After becoming aware of the apocalypse, Rick sets out to find his wife, Lori, and son, Carl. * Jon Bernthal as Shane Walsh, Rick's best friend since high school and former colleague, who helped Rick's family escape the apocalypse and is the leader of the Atlanta camp. Believing Rick to be dead, he also started a relationship with Lori, leading to complications when Rick unexpectedly returns alive and well. * Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori Grimes, Rick's wife and mother of Carl. Lori is an emotionally fragile yet independent woman, who started a relationship with Shane out of her grief for losing Rick, leaving her off- guard and very conflicted when Rick returns. * Laurie Holden as Andrea, a former successful civil rights attorney and sister of Amy. Andrea has a slight temper, but has a compassionate side and is very protective of her sister; both of them share a close bond with Dale. * Jeffrey DeMunn as Dale Horvath, an elderly survivor, who owns the RV around which the survivors have formed a camp. Dale is a wise man of morals, who isn't afraid to voice his opinion and is very protective of everyone's well-being, physically and emotionally. He serves as an adviser to Shane, then to Rick. Dale also has a close bond with Andrea and Amy. * Steven Yeun as Glenn Rhee, a former pizza delivery boy, who knows his way around Atlanta and often embarks on dangerous supply runs for the group. Glenn is a highly intelligent and resourceful, though slightly cocky yet hopeful individual, who cares for everyone yet he is easily taken advantage of by the other group members; Rick trusts him on supply runs. * Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes, Rick and Lori's son. He and his mother are taken to Atlanta by Shane after the initial outbreak. Supporting cast * Emma Bell as Amy, Andrea's younger, childish and innocent sister; both have a close bond with Dale. Amy is shown to generally care for the children in the camp. * Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon, Merle's equally aggressive and volatile younger brother and hunter. Unlike Merle, however, Daryl is far more reasonable and willing to follow the group's lead. * IronE Singleton as Theodore \\"T-Dog\\" Douglas, a fellow survivor in the Atlanta group. T-Dog is a man of honor and duty, who always tries to do what's right by people even if they don't deserve it or he doesn't like it, and is heavily burdened when he makes mistakes and always tries to make it right. * Melissa McBride as Carol Peletier, Lori's best friend since the outbreak occurred and the mother of Sophia and the friendly yet soft-spoken wife of Ed. * Jeryl Prescott Sales as Jacqui, a member of the group, who is the only survivor of her family and a former zoning office worker. * Andrew Rothenberg as Jim, a mechanic and a quiet yet tortured member of the group, who saw his wife and children killed and eaten by walkers. * Juan Pareja as Morales, another member of the group, who knows the city's infrastructure and puts his family first, and is also a fairly optimistic person. * Madison Lintz as Sophia Peletier, Carol and Ed's quiet daughter, and Carl's best friend. * Adam Minarovich as Ed Peletier, Carol's abusive husband and Sophia's father. He frequently has issues with Shane and is implicated to have also abused other women at the camp. * Maddie Lomax as Eliza Morales, daughter of the aforementioned Morales and Miranda. She is the older sister of Louis. * Viviana Chavez-Vega as Miranda Morales, wife of the aforementioned Morales and mother to Eliza and Louis. * Noah Lomax as Louis Morales, son of the aforementioned Morales and Miranda. He is the younger brother of Eliza. * Noah Emmerich as Dr. Edwin Jenner, a pathologist in the Atlanta CDC looking for any kind of cure. Guest cast * Lennie James as Morgan Jones, Duane's father, Jenny's husband and the first survivor that Rick encounters. * Michael Rooker as Merle Dixon, former military and drug dealer and Daryl's racist, volatile and unreasonable older brother, who is also a hunter. His volatile tendencies often put him at odds with the group. * Jim R. Coleman as Lambert Kendal, a police officer, who works with both Rick and Shane. * Linds Edwards as Leon Basset, a somewhat inexperienced police officer, who works with both Rick and Shane. * Keisha Tillis as Jenny Jones, Morgan's wife and Duane's mother. * Adrian Kali Turner as Duane Jones, Morgan and Jenny's son. * Noel G. as Felipe, a member of Guillermo's gang, the cousin of Miguel and the grandson of \\"Abuela\\". * Neil Brown Jr. as Guillermo, the leader of a Vatos group in Atlanta taking care of a hospital. * Anthony Guajardo as Miguel, a teenage member of Guillermo's gang, Felipe's cousin and \\"Abuela's\\" grandson. * Gina Morelli as \\"Abuela\\", Felipe and Miguel's grandmother. * James Gonzaba as Jorge, a member of Guillermo's gang. The series features several actors Walking Dead developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, Melissa McBride and Juan Pareja. All four appeared in his 2007 film The Mist, along with Samuel Witwer, who appeared as a dying soldier, and with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. He was wanted to be Rick Grimes. He is also in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic (she played Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has additionally appeared in several of Darabont's films, in addition to The Mist and The Majestic: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999). Promotion The show's official website released a motion comic based on the first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed that they were pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes from \\"Days Gone Bye\\" were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that \\"[they] really are doing six one- hour movie\\", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. \\"The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing.\\" The Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries. \\"Days Gone Bye\\" premiered in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl on August 30, 2011, while it expanded in international markets during the first week of November. Two weeks prior to its official premiere in the United States, the contents of the episode leaked online. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, international broadcasting affiliates of AMC and Fox coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event proceeding days prior to premiere of the episode in the United States. The event occurred in twenty six cities worldwide, and were hosted in select locations including the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., Palace of Westminster in London, Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Acropolis of Athens in Athens, and the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The campaign events commenced in Hong Kong and Taipei, and culminated in Los Angeles. The Walking Dead was included on the cover of the December 2010 edition of Entertainment Weekly, which featured Rick Grimes pointing a gun at a horde of walkers. According to the journalist of the magazine, it \\"examines the past, present, and future\\" of the television franchise; \\"from the comic book's humble beginnings, to unlikely path to the small screen, to even more unlikely path as a bona fide hit.\\" Kirkman was ecstatic upon hearing of the news. \\"I've got to say‚Äînot to kiss your magazine's a‚Äì or anything‚Äîbut when they called me and said Frank [Darabont] wanted to do the show, I was like, 'Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.' And then when AMC was like, 'We're picking up the show,' I was like, 'Yeah, alright, whatever.' When they actually started shooting the pilot I was like, 'Well, this is kind of real, this is neat.' But when they called me and said, 'Your show's on the cover of Entertainment Weekly,' I think that was the first time I was like, 'Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening to me!'\\" Episodes Reception Critical response The first season of The Walking Dead received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 82 out of 100, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\", based on 25 critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 87% with an average rating of 7.37 out of 10 based on 30 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Blood-spattered, emotionally resonant, and white-knuckle intense, The Walking Dead puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre.\\" Following the pilot episode's debut, TV Guides Matt Roush called the show \\"a stark and harrowing survival parable ... visually stunning ... and daring in its artful use of silence.\\" Following the second episode, Simon Abrams from Slant Magazine awarded the show three and a half stars out of a possible four; \\"To say that Darabont has kicked his series off with a bang would be a serious understatement ... [he] has fashioned a fully realized alternate reality and it's a thrilling thing to experience.\\" In response to the season finale, James Poniewozik of TIME magazine gave the first season of The Walking Dead a glowing review stating, \\"the show has an urgency and bravery that make it something special\\". Josh Jackson of Paste magazine also praised the season by writing, \\"the characters are worth caring about\\" despite \\"occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes\\". Some reviews were mixed, including one from Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant who concluded, \\"The Walking Dead still hasn't really defined itself as anything more than a vague survival story about the human condition\\" but added, \\"you can be sure I'm one of those Dead-heads already chomping at the bit for season 2\\". Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic also offered mixed criticism saying the first season \\"had its ups and downs\\" noting that the second season should focus on \\"a more specific story arc and strengthening of the character development\\". Logan Hill of New York magazine was more critical, claiming the episodes contained \\"atrocious dialogue\\" and \\"a lot of plot machinery that has been contrived to create action suspense but ... hasn't really moved the story itself anywhere in particular\\", though he admits the fifth episode showed \\"flashes of promise\\". Accolades The first season of The Walking Dead was named one of the Top 10 Television Programs in 2010 by the American Film Institute. The season was also nominated for Outstanding New Program at the 27th TCA Awards and Best New Series at the 63rd Writers Guild of America Awards.

It is named after the estate and great house which it adjoins. It is bounded to the east by the Wag Water River and is essentially a linear settlement strung out along a short section of the A3 road at an elevation of about .Reference: UK Directorate of Overseas Surveys 1:50,000 map of Jamaica sheet L, 1967. To the east of the river is a ridge and triangulation station which overlooks the settlement and is also called Temple Hall. History of the estate First owned by Thomas Temple, Temple Hall estate was at first a sugar estate but later became an experimental area for many crops. It is where Sir Nicholas Lawes (1652-1731) introduced the cultivation of coffee to the island in 1728. Lawes was governor of Jamaica from 1718‚Äì22 and married Temple's daughter, Susannah, in 1698 being given the estate as a dowry. Laws also experimented with the growing of tobacco, and set up the first printing press. James Hall inherited the estate and sold it in 1733 to Thomas Howe of St Catherine. Subsequent owners were Andrew Lindo (1811), George Atkinson (1831) E Reid (1845) Simon D Soutar (late 1800s, early 1900s) and the Crosswell family who were still in possession in 1978. Onis Johnson, Dr. Ionie Johnson and son Cedric Johnson from Craft Hill Claredon and St Andrew inherited the Estate in 1978. Great House burn down in 1978. The cottage was not affected. The Great House redesign and restore in 1979 by the Johnson family. Johnson family Sold the property to the Mr. Smith in 1999 after Mr. Onis Johnson got sick. His son did not want the property.

She was born in Coburg, Germany, to √âmile Desportes, a composer, and Bertha Troriep, a painter. She was a student of Paul Dukas and won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome in 1932. She taught at the Paris Conservatoire and wrote many music textbooks. She composed over 300 works.  Education  She studied piano with Yvonne Lef√©bure and Alfred Cortot. She took a preparatory solfege class at the Paris Conservatoire in 1918. She studied for three years at the √âcole Normale de Musique and then attended the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Paris from 1925 to 1932.Hamer, 2009, p. 162-163. She took classes from Jean and No√´l Gallon, Marcel Dupr√©, Maurice Emmanuel, and Paul Dukas, whose class is pictured below.Vilcosqui, 2007, p. 100. Classe-dukas Prix de Rome In 1927, Desportes won the Premier Prix in harmony. In 1928 she won the Premier Prix in fugue.Hamer, 2009, p. 163. She competed for the Prix de Rome four times. In 1929 she did not advance to the second round. In 1930 she won the Deuxi√®me Second Grand Prix. Paul Bertrand's review of Desportes's cantata Act√©on, which appeared in Le M√©nestrel, remarked on her harmonic conception and on her femininity: \\"On the whole it is conceived harmonically and not contrapuntally, solidly established from the beginning in the tonality of E within which she deploys pleasant drumming chords. It is all delicacy, all femininity, attested by a marked predilection for ternary measures and rhythms, evoking with a pleasant spontaneaity, a touching freshness of feeling.\\"Hamer, 2009, p. 164. In 1931 she won the Premier Second Grand Prix. Paul Bertrand wrote in his annual review that \\"Her Cantata was perhaps, out of all of them, the most homogeneous and the most skilful [sic] by a keen sense of progressions and contrast. But it seemed to last somewhat both scope and real senstivitiy\\".Hamer, 2009, p. 165. She beat Henriette Puig-Roget who won the Deuxi√®me Second Grand Prix. Two females had never won these prizes in the same year before. In 1932 Desportes won the Premier Grand Prix. Paul Betrand wrote: \\"Mlle. Desportes possesses a real sensitivity and a precious gift for dramatic expression. She found herself at ease in the interpretation of a text of clearly theatrical nature. Without sacrificing to excess the intrinsic quality of the music, she subordinated it to the drama, and notably gave to the Romance a colour at once simple and moving, enveloped the drinking song in a picturesque fantasy.\\" Her cantata was also praised for its unified cyclic structure.James R. Briscoe: \\"Desportes, Yvonne\\", in: Grove Music Online (accessed 14 September 2014). In her dissertation Musiciennes: Women Musicians in France during the Interwar Years, 1919-1939, Laura Ann Hamer discusses Desportes's win and her life struggles. The Institut de France's \\"awarding of the Premier Grand Prix to Desportes in 1931 , at a time when the French government actively sought to marginalise women within the domestic sphere and to exclude them from public life, suggests that women were sufficiently accepted by the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts to allow them to award their highest prize to a young mother, whose divorce and determination to succeed as a musician represented a significant flouting of normal social conventions in interwar France\\".Hamer, 2009, p. 166. Teaching career At the Villa M√©dicis, she met and wed Ulysse Gemignani, Premier Grand Prix de Rome in sculpture. In 1932 she ended her position as harmony tutor at the Conservatoire. When she returned she found the same position except teaching solf√®ge from 1937 to 1938. Then she wrote her famous Le√ßons de solf√®ge. At the beginning of 1943 she became a tenured professor in solf√®ge then, in 1959, a professor of counterpoint and fugue.Vilcosqui, 2007, p. 101. Desportes wrote 332 instrumental works (159 vocal works and 31 music textbooks). These works include three symphonies, a requiem and eight operas. Her compositional style, though influenced by the Baroque period, swayed more toward the \\"rich orchestral palette of the Russian Five [‚Ä¶] and the harmonic language of Ravel and early Stravinsky.\\"Hamer, 2009, p. 167. Despite being an active composer and music educator, Desportes also took her family life seriously. When an interviewer asked if they had forgotten any aspect of her career she responded, \\"yes, the part which relates to my sons: eleven and thirteen years old. And to my older daughter: seventeen years old.\\"Hamer, 2009, p. 223. Compositional style A composer with a sense of humor, in her Variations sur le nom de Beethoven for orchestra (1974), not only is each letter of the composer's first and last name transcribed by a note (with enormous intervals between each one), but one detects allusions to his 5th Symphony in the middle of a personal melody. In Pavane pour un timbalier d√®funt: A F√©lix Passerone in memoriam (Pavane for a deceased timpanist: For F√©lix Passerone, former principal timpanist of the Paris Opera and teacher at the Conservatoire). The work is for military drum or snare drum accompanying singers forced to sing ‚Äútataralatatarasa‚Ä¶ tiguidiguiditatalota‚Ä¶‚Äù punctuated by the interjection given in the subtitle‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúScrogneugneu!‚Äù (which translates to Humph!) Vilcosqui, 2007, p. 102-103. The use of a name represented by notes was also used in Desportes‚Äôs saxophone and harp duet, Une fleur sur l‚Äô√©tang (a flower on the pond). Idit Shner wrote, \\"The third movement [‚Ä¶] is dedicated to [Daniel] Kientzy through the incorporation of his name in the music. Beginning in measure 51 [‚Ä¶] letters appear above each pitch in the saxophone and harp line. The letters spell \\"Daniel Kientzy\\" forwards and backwards (prime and retrograde).\\"Idit Shner: Music for Saxophone and Harp: An Investigation of the Development of the Genre with an Annotated Bibliography (DMA diss., University of North Texas, 2007), p. 68-9. The name Daniel is used in this score. Reviews In his review of Desportes' brass quintet Imageries d'antan (Imageries of yesteryear), Donald Johns describes her use of meter and compositional style. \\"As the title suggests, this is a programmatic work, and each of the three movements reflects a different character: the first, a driving, fanfare-type movement, expresses a martial character; the second, a love duet, is musically realized by trumpet and trombone; and the third, a lively dance with intense use of changing meters, includes a host of variations in the subdivision of eight-eight and ten-eight meters. The changing meters are employed √† la Stravinsky to enhance the flexibility of the phrase structure ‚Äì all very organic and logical. Though it is dedicated \\"au merveilleux Quintette de l‚ÄôOrchestre National de France\\", the work is not an orgy of technical display. Despite a fair amount of high tessitura playing, especially for the first trumpet, the work is, in general, comfortably written, and filled with the coloration of quartal and polyharmonies that are surefire staples of brass writing. All in all, a successful job of solid, satisfying, and typical moments in some works by Honegger and Milhaud.\\"Donald Johns: \\"Music Reviews: Instrumental Solo and Ensemble Music for Brass\\", in: Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association vol. 42, no. 3 (Mar 1986), p. 656-7. In a book written by Michel Gemingnani, Desportes's son, Gemignani collected tributes from colleagues and students of his mother: \\"You reaped numerous prizes at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Paris, but you learned to develop an inner sense of beautiful work, music that breathes with the heart, and devotion to others.\\" Marcel Landownski, 14 November 1994, French composer, 1915-1999.Gemignani, 1995, p. 13. \\"I always was (and still am) dazzled by the number of works that she wrote, and by the facility with which it came out of her pen. [‚Ä¶] Her music, always spontaneous and lively, sometimes willingly displayed a rebelliously humoristic and anti-conformist spirit rare in contemporary music. [‚Ä¶] She had a sufficiently open spirit to discern that which was valuable and incorporate certain techniques in her own music, not to be 'modern', but because she saw the expressive possibilities she could draw.\\" Jacques Casterede, French composer, 1926-2014.Gemignani, 1995, p. 14-15. \\"Pedagogy, outside of the transmission of knowledge, implies a high sensitivity and a psychological sense adapted to the students oh which one must guess slow progress, hesitations, and trial and error. Yvonne Desportes possessed these faculties in the highest form, knowing to be strict, severe even when he fails, but also encourage the student when he loses his step.\\" Jean Podromides, French composer, 1926-.Gemignani, 1995, p. 26. Desportes retired from the Conservatoire in 1978. She was awarded the Chevalier de l'Ordre National du M√©rite. Hamer describes how Desportes \\"wrote a number of works for her eldest son, the percussionist Vincent Gemignani, including the Concerto pour percussion et orchestre (1963). In doing this, she became one of the first composers to write a concerto for percussion, and contributed to its elevation to solo status. She also experimented with writing for the new percussion instrument which he invented: la bronte.‚ÄùHamer, 2009, p. 224. The bronte is described as \\"an extraordinary musical instrument made of nickel silver, which has metal keyboards amplified by a resonator. Played with a bow or with hammers, this 'sound sculpture' can produce a wide array of sounds (spreading from the absolute deepest to the very highest) in totally original colours and uncommonly sensual keys which are both profound and mysterious.\\"‚ÄúVincent Geminiani‚Äù Discogs, accessed 5 October 2014. Yvonne Desportes died in 1993 in Paris.Gemignani, 1995, p. 5.

He was born at Rj√∫pnafell, Vopnafj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, where he grew up. In Vopnafj√∂r√∞ur he showed inclination for music, and in his twenties Bj√∂rgvin moved with his family to the Icelandic colonies in Canada, where he stayed until 1926. In 1923 Bj√∂rgvin married H√≥lmfr√≠√∞ur Fr√≠mann, a Canadian-born woman of Icelandic descent. During this period Bj√∂rgvin composed the oratorios Strengleikar (English: Stringed Instruments) and Fri√∞ur √° j√∂r√∞u (English: Peace on Earth), in addition to the cantata Adveniat regnum tuum. The cantata was performed in Winnipeg, Manitoba in the fall of 1925, after which the Icelandic Canadian population organized to support Bj√∂rgvin to study musicology in London. Bj√∂rgvin studied at London's Royal College of Music for two years. During that time, Icelandic poet Stephan G. Stephansson sent him his work √ûi√∞randakvi√∞a, to which Bj√∂rgvin composed one of his greatest works, the oratorio √ñrlagag√°tan (English: Riddle of Fate). Bj√∂rgvin moved back to Winnipeg, where he completed his last major composition in 1929, √çslands √æ√∫sund √°r (English: Iceland's Thousand Years), a cantata to Dav√≠√∞ Stef√°nsson's Al√æingish√°t√≠√∞arlj√≥√∞. At this time, Bj√∂rgvin was offered teaching positions in his native Iceland, at both Akureyri Junior College and Akureyri's primary school. In 1931, Bj√∂rgvin moved back to Iceland to teach singing in Akureyri. He held his position at Akureyri Junior College until 1957, when he resigned for health reasons. In Akureyri Bj√∂rgvin composed numerous songs and minor musical works. He founded a cantata choir, which performed many of his works. Back in Iceland Bj√∂rgvin started writing. He wrote articles for journals, the play Skr√∫√∞sb√≥ndinn from an Icelandic fairy tale, and his memoirs. Many of his literary works have never been published.

Biography Born in Santo Stefano Ticino in 1230, Squarcino was the son of Lanfranco of Borri (end of 12th ‚Äì early 13th century), the local feudal lord of the city of Santo Stefano Ticino. The Borri family was one of the most respected in Milan, and a late tradition, with no historical basis, associates saint Monas of Milan, Bishop of Milan, with the Borris. Even in his youth, Squarcino (unlike his father) undertook a military career and placed himself at the head of the noble exiles from Milan after the Torriani family took power in that city. He remained a faithful supporter of the Visconti family, and distinguished himself as a captain in the service of Ottone Visconti in the famous Battle of Desio in January 1277. In 1254, he married Antonia (1236‚Äì?), of an unknown lineage, and they had a daughter, Bonacossa Borri, who in 1269 married Matteo I Visconti, a future Lord of Milan. At the same time the family Borri were reconfirmed in their feudal rights over their lands, and the same Squarcino also became lord of the lands of Castellazzo de' Stampi in Corbetta in 1275.

(1995). Audience segmentation in worksite health promotion: A procedure using social marketing concepts. Health Education Research, 10, 211‚Äì224.Williams, J.E., & Flora, J.A. (1995). Health behavior segmentation and campaign planning to reduce cardiovascular disease risk among Hispanics. Health Education Quarterly, 22, 36‚Äì48. Audience segmentation is used in commercial marketing so advertisers can design and tailor products and services that satisfy the targeted groups. In social marketing, audiences are segmented into subgroups and assumed to have similar interests, needs and behavioral patterns and this assumption allows social marketers to design relevant health or social messages that influence the people to adopt recommended behaviors.Rimal, R.N. & Adkins, A.D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In Thompson T.L., Dorsey, A., Miller, K.I., Parrott, R. (Eds), Handbook of health communication (pp. 498‚Äì499). New York, NY: Routledge. Audience segmentation is widely accepted as a fundamental strategy in communication campaigns to influence health and social change.Slater, M.D. (1996). Theory and method in health audience segmentation. Journal of Health Communication, 1, 267‚Äì283. Audience segmentation makes campaign efforts more effective when messages are tailored to the distinct subgroups and more efficient when the target audience is selected based on their susceptibility and receptivity.Atkin, C. & Freimuth, V. (2001). Formative evaluation research in campaign design. In R.E. Rice & C.K. Atkin (Eds.), Public communication campaigns (3rd ed., pp. 125‚Äì145). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.Dervin, B. & Frenette, M.

Atkin (Eds.), Public communication campaigns (3rd ed., pp. 69‚Äì87). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Criteria for audience segmentation strategy Audience segmentation strategy is driven by the goal of developing criteria that can be used to form homogeneous clusters. The most common criteria used are demographics (age, level of education, income, ethnicity and gender) and geography (region, county, census tract). Since an audience segment that is derived exclusively from demographics such as Asian- American youths constitutes a large group that still has varied beliefs, values and behavior, demographics may not be sufficient as segmentation criteria.Slater, M.D. (1996). Theory and method in health audience segmentation. Journal of Health Communication, 1, 267‚Äì283. More sophisticated segmentation strategies use psychosocial, behavioral and psychographics (personality, values, attitudes, interests, level of readiness for change and lifestyles) as variables to categorize audience subgroups.Weinstein, A. (1994). Market segmentation: Using demographics, psychographics and other niche marketing techniques to predict and model customer behavior. Chicago, IL: Probus. Once the audience has been divided into segments based on selected criteria, campaigns are then designed and communication channels are selected to reach their intended audience effectively. Grunig's model of segmentation Grunig proposed a theory-based model of segmentation which comprises a series of inner and outer nests.Grunig, J.E. (1989). Publics, audiences, and market segments: Segmentation principles for campaigns. In C.T. Salmon (Ed.) Information campaigns: Balancing social values and social change (pp. 199‚Äì228). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. The inner nests contain (a) individuals (individual communication behaviors and effects) and (b) publics (groups of people sharing common interests and issues). The outer nests consist of (c) communities, (d) psychographics, lifestyles and subcultures, and social relationships, (e) geodemographics, (f) demographics/social categories and (g) mass audience. The nests display increasing specificity instead of generality as they move towards the inner center; more specificity provides more audience details and insights that allow communication campaigns to create more precise messages for the target audience. Ethical issues Audience segmentation is employed in health interventions as a strategy to effectively utilize limited resources to reach the intended population. Equity and utility are often the prominent ethical issues in audience segmentation.Guttman, N. (1997). Ethical dilemmas in health communication interventions. Health Communication, 9, 155‚Äì190.Kahn, J.G., (1996). The cost effectiveness of HIV prevention targeting: How much more bang for the buck? American Journal of Public Health, 86, 1709‚Äì1712.Rothschild, M.L. (2001). Ethical considerations in the use of marketing for the management of public health and social issues. In A.R. Andreasen (Ed.), Ethics in social marketing (pp. 36‚Äì69). Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. Some campaigns target people who are most inclined to accept suggested messages while other campaigns aim at those with highest risk, despite the fact that they are hard to reach or least likely to adopt recommended behavior.Des Jarlais, D.C., Padian, N.S., & Winkelstein, W. (1994). Targeted HIV-prevention programs. New England Journal of Medicine, 331, 1451‚Äì1453.Freimuth, V.S., & Mettger, W. (1990). Is there a hard-to-reach audience? Public Health Reports, 105, 232‚Äì238. Ethical dilemma occurs when health communicators have to identify audience segments and plan health interventions for these groups, depriving those not targeted in the process. Public health campaigns often target large segments of population who have low to moderate risk as small changes can create visible impact on morbidity and mortality.Rose, G. (1985). Sick individuals and sick populations. International Journal of Epidemiology, 14, 32‚Äì38. Health campaigns aim to decrease alcoholic beverage consumption focus on moderate users who are larger in number and have higher likelihood to respond positively to the interventions.Guttman, N. (2003). Ethics in health communication interventions. In Thompson T.L., Dorsey, A., Miller, K.I., Parrott, R. (Eds), Handbook of health communication (pp. 657‚Äì658). New York, NY: Routledge. On the other hand, targeting small segments of the high risk population (e.g. heavy smokers) in quit smoking campaigns may be inefficient as they are less likely to stop the risky behavior.Fisher, E.B. (1995). Editorial: The results of the COMMIT Trial. American Journal of Public Health, 83, 159‚Äì160. Audience segmentation can also cause conflicts within the community. The Nigeria STD/HIV Management Project, funded by the UK Department of International Development (DFID) in 1999 stirred intense conflicts after non-targeted community members felt resources had been unfairly allocated to the \\"unworthy\\" audience segment, people living with HIV/AIDS. As a result, HIV-infected victims were turned away from attending health centers, excluded and discriminated by the community and 25 people with HIV/AIDS in the project eventually died by the end of 2000.Gruber, J. & Caffrey, M. (2005). HIV/AIDS and community conflict in Nigeria: implications and challenges. Social Science & Medicine, 60, 1209‚Äì1218. Use in international health campaigns Slater and Flora's 1991 study on the risk of cardiovascular disease among central Californians utilized health behaviors to segment the audience into seven subgroups.Slater, M. & Flora, J.A. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221‚Äì233. The health behaviors criteria included (a) cognitive (health knowledge, attitudes, issue involvement, perceived response efficacy, perceived risk, and perceived self-efficacy); (b) social influence (community, reference group and family norms, expectations from family and friends, and social visibility of behavior); and (c) individual norms obtained from personal history. The study yielded two distinctive subgroups, despite their demographic similarities (White and middle socioeconomic status). The group with moderate level of good diets and physical activity and low tobacco consumption was more likely to seek health information and believed that cardiovascular disease was preventable by changing their health behavior. On the other hand, the group with poor diets, high level of alcohol and tobacco consumption and high perception of susceptibility to cardiovascular disease did not plan to mitigate those risks and refrained from seeking health information.Slater, M. & Flora, J.A. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221‚Äì233. The disparities between these two segments were crucial for health communicators to design and tailor different messages to influence their health behaviors. Rimal, Brown, Mkandawire, Folda, Bose and Creel identified risk perceptions and efficacy beliefs as the main audience segmentation criteria for the HIV-prevention project in Malawi.Rimal, R.N., Brown, J., Mkandawire, G., Folda, L., Bose, K. & Creel, A.H. (2009). Audience segmentation as a social-marketing tool in health promotion: Use of the risk perception attitude framework in HIV Prevention in Malawi. American Journal of Public Health, 99 (12), 2224‚Äì2229. Four subgroups created were responsive (high risk, high efficacy), avoidance (high risk, low efficacy), proactive (low risk, high efficacy) and indifference (low risk, low efficacy). The study found different levels of HIV knowledge, HIV testing and condom use among the four segments. Responsive and proactive groups were most responsive to preventive behaviors whereas avoidance and indifference groups were less inclined to practice preventive behaviors. Audience segmentation could be utilized in Malawi to target different segments with tailored messages in risk perceptions and efficacy beliefs in order to influence them to adopt recommended HIV prevention behaviors.

After law school, Blaine joined the law office of Senator Cushman Kellogg Davis (R‚ÄìMinn.) in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1881, Blaine's father became the United States Secretary of State in the administration of President of the United States James A. Garfield. Blaine's father named him Third Assistant Secretary of State, with Blaine holding this office from July 1, 1881 until June 30, 1882. During his time as Third Assistant Secretary, Blaine and William Henry Trescot were sent on a special diplomatic mission to South America. Following the death of Garfield and the resignation of the older Blaine, President Chester A. Arthur appointed Walker Blaine assistant counsel of the United States for the Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims. Blaine held this office until the court's abolition on January 1, 1886. He then moved to Chicago to practice law. In 1889, Blaine's father became Secretary of State for the second time (this time in the Benjamin Harrison administration) and James G.

Its civil and military administration was overseen by a duke (dux) appointed by and under the authority originally of the Praetorian Prefect of Italy (554‚Äì584) and later of the Exarch of Ravenna (584‚Äì751).. Its chief city and namesake was Perugia (Perusia), located at its centre. It was a band of territory connecting the Duchy of the Pentapolis to its northeast with the Duchy of Rome to its southwest, and separating the duchies of Tuscia (to its northwest) and Spoleto (to its southeast), both parts of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy. It was of great strategic significance to the Byzantines since it provided communication between Rome, the city of the Popes, and Ravenna, the capital of the Exarchate. Since it cut off the Duke of Spoleto from his nominal overlord, the king ruling from Pavia, it also disturbed the Lombard kingdom, which was a constant thorn in the Byzantines' side. This strategic importance meant that many Lombard and Byzantine armies passed through it. Thomas Noble, an American historian, has surmised that by 739‚Äì740, when Pope Gregory III was negotiating with Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, for assistance against the Lombards, the Pope already envisaged an independent republic of his \\"peculiar people\\" (peculiarem populum), meaning the inhabitants of the duchies of Perugia and Rome who, so remote from either Ravenna or the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, depended upon the Pope for defence and for their foreign relations.. Hildeprand, the heir to the throne, and Peredeo, Duke of Vicenza, united to take Ravenna, probably in 737‚Äì740. According to the contemporary Lombard historian Paul the Deacon, this occurred before \\"the Romans, swollen with their accustomed pride, assembled on every side under the leadership of Agatho, duke of the Perugians, and came to seize Bononia (Bologna), where Walcari, Peredeo, and Rotcari were then staying in camp, but the latter rushed upon the Romans, made a great slaughter of them and compelled those who were left to seek flight.\\". According to modern historians Georg Waitz, Jan Hallenbeck, and Paolo Delogu, this took place before the ephemeral conquest of Ravenna. The most common interpretation is that Agatho was trying to regain Bologna, which was a part of his duchy until it was conquered by Liutprand around 727‚Äì730, and in so doing broke a truce between the Byzantines and Lombards, thus provoking an assault on Ravenna.. In 749, the Lombard king Ratchis invaded the duchies of Perugia and Pentapolis, besieging the capital city of the former. Pope Zachary met the king at Perugia and convinced him to lift the siege and abdicate to a monastery. It has been suggested that Ratchis was forced to attack Byzantine Italy by a part of Lombard nationalists, or conversely that he attacked because Zachary had broken the terms of his predecessor's Peace of Terni, a twenty-year truce.. In any case, \\"all Italy was quiet\\" between Ratchis's accession in 745 and his attack on Perugia in 749, according to Zachary's biographer in the Liber pontificalis. With the collapse of the exarchate and the capture of Ravenna by the Lombards in 751,. the duchy of Perugia was left under de facto Papal authority by 752.. In a passage of the Ludovicianum that can date no earlier than 774, the cities of the Roman duchy are listed from north to south, with the cities of the duchy of Perugia added to those of Roman Tuscany, indicating that by the time of conquest of the Lombard kingdom by the Franks, Perugia had been incorporated into the Papally-ruled duchy of Rome.. In fact, the duchy of Perugia as a distinct political unit cannot be charted later than the 740s..

It exists as a county highway in both counties. It runs from Oswego through Aurora to North Aurora, where it connects with Randall Road. Much traffic continues northward on Randall Road to access Batavia, Illinois and points northward in the Fox Valley.  Route description  Having mostly been a 2-lane road until the early 2000s, Orchard Road is now largely a four-lane major road running on the west sides of Aurora, Montgomery, and Oswego, paralleling the Fox River. It is commonly used as a western alternative to Illinois Routes 31 and 25, which run in close proximity to the Fox River. Because Routes 25 and 31 run through downtown Aurora and Oswego, they have lower speed limits and more obstructions to smooth traffic. Orchard Road's speed limit is 45 for most of its length, never dipping below 40, and it has four lanes for most of its length, making Orchard Road the route of choice for many travelers moving north-south through these locales.  Kendall County  Orchard Road's southern terminus is at an intersection with Illinois Route 71 in Oswego, where the roadway continues south as Minkler Road. From there, Orchard Road runs north to cross the Fox River and shortly afterward, U.S. Route 34. The road continues north past the Caterpillar, Inc. plant in Montgomery to meet U.S. Route 30 at the Kane/Kendall County line. Although Kendall County does not sign its county highways, Orchard Road is designated as Kendall County Highway 9A. Orchard Road is known in Kane County as Kane County Highway 83.  Kane County  From U.S. Route 30, Orchard Road continues northbound into the western reaches of Aurora, serving as a main north-south artery alternative to Illinois Route 31 and Illinois Route 25, which are generally slower. It crosses Galena Boulevard, the main east-west access to downtown Aurora. Farther north, it reaches Sullivan Road, which provides access to the Illinois Math and Science Academy. As Orchard Road crosses into North Aurora, it meets a complete interchange with Interstate 88. From there, it begins to curve northeasterly to meet Randall Road; the road continues eastbound as Mooseheart Road, toward Mooseheart and Illinois Route 31. The entire length of Orchard Road within Kane County is designated Kane County Highway 83, and it is signed as such in several locations.  Impact of urban sprawl  As it stands, all of Orchard Road is 4 lanes with the exception of the southern end from the Fox River bridge to Illinois Route 71. As the Orchard Road corridor is being overtaken by urban sprawl from the Chicago area, the need to improve the road is and has been constantly growing. Kendall County was statistically the fastest-growing county in the United States within the time period from 2000 to 2007, with high-magnitude growth occurring in Kane County as well. Though no mention of widening the bottleneck appears in Kane County's 2011 construction plans, Kendall County's long-term plans also call for a widening of the Fox River bridge at the southern end of Orchard Road.  Recent improvements  The need to expand the capacity of Orchard Road has been met with many improvements over the past decade. The first of a wave of new bridges over the Fox River, a crossing at Orchard Road was constructed in 2000 and 2001, linking Routes 34 and 71. Before then, Orchard Road's southern terminus was simply at Route 34. This bridge was useful in allowing for traffic to cross the river without navigating through downtown Oswego or Yorkville. 2001 marked the beginning of a massive reconstruction project oriented on widening a large portion of Orchard Road from just south of Prairie Street north to near Interstate 88. This accompanied a project dealing with the encounter with the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe railroad tracks, converting what was an at-grade intersection to a railroad overpass accompanied by an overpass carrying the adjacent Virgil Gilman Trail, a bike path. This brought the southern end of the 4-lane section in Kane County to just south of the railroad overpass. A Park and Ride facility was completed in 2004 at the intersection of Orchard Road and Mill Road in Oswego. The site, adjacent to tracks owned by the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad (different from the tracks involved in the grade separation project mentioned above), was originally envisioned as a train station. The proposed station would serve as the new extent of Metra's BNSF light rail service from Chicago to Aurora. A renovation of Orchard Road from Interstate 88 north to Randall Road was completed in 2005. It consisted of road widening and intersection improvement at Oak Street, among other improvements.\\"North Aurora Approves Orchard Gateway.\\" Beacon News. Date accessed: December 7, 2010. In 2007, the 4-lane portion of Orchard Road in Kane County was extended a bit further south with an intersection improvement at Jericho Road. Shortly after in 2008, a signal was constructed at Rochester Drive, an industrial entrance south of Jericho road. Also in 2007, Kendall County performed the first of its widening projects for Orchard Road. The portion from U.S. Route 30 south to just north of the BNSF railroad overpass near the new Park-and-Ride was upgraded to 4 lanes. In spring and summer 2009, construction was carried out to widen Orchard Road from the railroad overpass in Oswego south to just short of the Fox River bridge. Even so, local officials found the work to be long overdue. From that railroad overpass southward to just beyond U.S. Route 34, the 4-lane trend was extended with a widening of that section a year later. Future plans In fall 2010, Kane County was awarded $2.6 million for constructing three new bike paths, one of which is to follow along Orchard Road from U.S. Route 30 to Jericho Road. This will provide a safe pedestrian connection from the Virgil Gilman Trail to Montgomery businesses.\\"Kane getting $2.6 million for new bike paths.\\" Geneva Sun. Date accessed: December 4, 2010. In 2011, Kane County intends to create plans for a rehabilitation of the overpass carrying Orchard Road over Interstate 88,\\"Kane County 2030 Transportation Plan.\\" Kane County Department of Transportation. Date accessed: December 4, 2010. specifically, a replacement of the bridge deck. Also, at some point during the year, Kendall County intents to implement a feasibility study of a potential east-west connection between Illinois 71, Minkler Road, and Grove Road. The Minkler Road connection would occur just south of the Orchard Road-Illinois 71 intersection. This may create an easy connection from Orchard Road to Grove Road southbound without maneuvering through inner Oswego. As Kendall County annually drafts a 20-year highway plan, several items pertaining to Orchard Road continue to appear on the list, the most notable being the widening of the bridge over the Fox River, which was completed only recently in 2000. This improvement, having been cited repeatedly in the long-term plans, will extend from the southern extent of the 4-lane section south to the Illinois 71 intersection. Other Orchard Road-related items on the list are as follows. *Improvement of the intersection at Illinois 71 *Improvement of the intersection at Tuscany Trail where Oswego meets Montgomery *Improvement of the intersection at Galena Road *Improvement of the intersection at U.S. Route 30, involving dual left turn lanes Kane County, in their 2030 highway plan, gives mention of planning to widen the region near the I-88 interchange, from Randall Road to Indian Trail Road, to six lanes.

Orbital overlap can lead to bond formation. The importance of orbital overlap was emphasized by Linus Pauling to explain the molecular bond angles observed through experimentation and is the basis for the concept of orbital hybridization. Since s orbitals are spherical (and have no directionality) and p orbitals are oriented 90¬∞ to each other, a theory was needed to explain why molecules such as methane (CH4) had observed bond angles of 109.5¬∞.Anslyn, Eric V./Dougherty, Dennis A. (2006). Modern Physical Organic Chemistry. University Science Books. Pauling proposed that s and p orbitals on the carbon atom can combine to form hybrids (sp3 in the case of methane) which are directed toward the hydrogen atoms. The carbon hybrid orbitals have greater overlap with the hydrogen orbitals, and can therefore form stronger C‚ÄìH bonds.Pauling, Linus. (1960). The Nature Of The Chemical Bond. Cornell University Press. A quantitative measure of the overlap of two atomic orbitals Œ®A and Œ®B on atoms A and B is their overlap integral, defined as : \\\\mathbf{S}_\\\\mathrm{AB}=\\\\int \\\\Psi_\\\\mathrm{A}^* \\\\Psi_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\, dV, where the integration extends over all space. The star on the first orbital wavefunction indicates the complex conjugate of the function, which in general may be complex-valued. Overlap matrix The overlap matrix is a square matrix, used in quantum chemistry to describe the inter-relationship of a set of basis vectors of a quantum system, such as an atomic orbital basis set used in molecular electronic structure calculations. In particular, if the vectors are orthogonal to one another, the overlap matrix will be diagonal. In addition, if the basis vectors form an orthonormal set, the overlap matrix will be the identity matrix. The overlap matrix is always n√ón, where n is the number of basis functions used. It is a kind of Gramian matrix. In general, each overlap matrix element is defined as an overlap integral: :\\\\mathbf{S}_{jk}=\\\\left \\\\langle b_j|b_k \\\\right \\\\rangle=\\\\int \\\\Psi_j^* \\\\Psi_k \\\\, d\\\\tau where :\\\\left |b_j \\\\right \\\\rangle is the j-th basis ket (vector), and :\\\\Psi_j is the j-th wavefunction, defined as :\\\\Psi_j(x)=\\\\left \\\\langle x b_j \\\\right \\\\rangle. In particular, if the set is normalized (though not necessarily orthogonal) then the diagonal elements will be identically 1 and the magnitude of the off-diagonal elements less than or equal to one with equality if and only if there is linear dependence in the basis set as per the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality. Moreover, the matrix is always positive definite; that is to say, the eigenvalues are all strictly positive.
