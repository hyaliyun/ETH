Life Born on April 18, 1982, Dennis M. Tobenski grew up in Kankakee, IL. In 2004, he graduated from Illinois State University, where he studied Vocal Performance with baritone John M. Koch, and Music Theory & Composition with Stephen Andrew Taylor, David Feurzeig and Serra Hwang. After graduating from ISU in 2004, he was invited to move to New York City to study privately with composer Daron Hagen. Tobenski was commissioned by the ISU School of Theatre to compose music for Shakespeare's The Tempest: the inaugural production of the newly constructed Center for the Performing Arts, which led him to write for several subsequent School of Theatre mainstage productions. These included Bertolt Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle, Frank McGuinness' adaptation of Sophocles’ Electra. The ISU College of Fine Arts commissioned the 2002 Elegy, a work for choir and chamber ensemble commemorating the events of September 11, 2001, and the 2004 Soliloquy for solo flute. Tobenski was commissioned in 2002 by baritone John M. Koch (whose 1996 performance of Il barbiere di Siviglia with the Florentine Opera was broadcast on PBS) to write Three Poems of Thomas Hardy. He later wrote music for the 2004 Chicago production of The Living Canvas, a performance art work for theatre that combines movement and dance with photographed images projected on the unclothed human form. He has written numerous works for the ISU Madrigal Singers, including Fair Robin I Love, a work commissioned for the 50th Anniversary Season of the ISU Madrigal Dinners –- the oldest tradition of its kind in the Midwest. Along with composer Jeff Algera, in April 2006, he co-founded the Tobenski-Algera Concert Series, a series devoted to the performance and promotion of new works by young and emerging composers.

But these lands have been inhabited much earlier. This is evidenced by archaeological finds. Specifically, in 1928 on the outskirts Mar'yanivka, near the village Borochychi during a mound of the future rail Lviv - Lutsk at a depth of 1m was found a huge treasure of silver and gold Roman coins in the number of 1500 copies.

Completed in 1876, it was the university's first permanent building, and is a good local example of Gothic Revival architecture. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974, in recognition of the university's place as one of the first historically black colleges and universities to be established after the American Civil War. It presently serves as an undergraduate residence hall. In 2017 the Tennessee Historical Commission installed a marker honoring the Jubilee Singers, whose 1870s European tour raised the funds to pay for the building's construction. Description and history Jubilee Hall is located on the northern side of the Fisk University Campus, on a loop drive at the northern end of 17th Avenue North at Meharry Boulevard. It is a large L-shaped masonry building, six stories in height, with a hip roof encrusted with gabled dormers and projections. Its main facade is divided into a central section and slightly projecting end sections, with a tower rising at the junction of the center and right sections. The tower rises to an open octagonal belfry and steeple, all adorned with Gothic spires. WIndows are generally set in segmented-arch openings, either singly or pairwise, with arched stone lintels. The main roof cornice has decorative brick corbelling. and 325px Fisk University was founded in 1865 through the efforts of the antislavery American Missionary Association, and was named for Clinton B. Fiske. The school was qualitatively different from other schools, in that it was designed from the outset to provide a full liberal arts education to its African-American students. In 1871, the financially troubled school raised funds to build Jubilee Hall by sending the Fisk Jubilee Singers in their first European singing tour in 1873.Fisk Jubilee Singers: Our History , accessed August 4, 2009Kay Beasley, Fisk Jubilee Singers (1871–), Tennessee State University. Accessed 31 August 2006. Jubilee Hall was built in 1873-76 with proceeds from the tour. It was designed by New York architect Stephen D. Hatch. Although its exterior is little changed, the interior has been completely modernized to provide dormitory facilities. It also houses a floor-to-ceiling portrait of the original Jubilee Singers that was given to the university by Queen Victoria during the 1873 tour.

Additive manufacturing is also known as 3D printing, while subtractive manufacturing may also be referred to as machining, and many other technologies can be exploited to physically produce the designed objects. Modeling Digitally fabricated objects are created with a variety of CAD software packages, using both 2D vector drawing, and 3D modeling. Types of 3D models include four models wireframe, solid, surface and mesh. A design is having one or more of these model types. Machines for fabrication Three machine are popular for fabrication: 1\\\\. CNC router 2\\\\. Laser cutter 3\\\\. 3D Printer =CNC Milling machine= CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control. CNC mills or routers include proprietary software which interprets 2D vector drawings or 3D models and converts this information to a G-code, which represents specific CNC functions in alphanumeric format which the CNC mill can interpret. The G-codes drive a machine tool, a powered mechanical device typically used to fabricate components. CNC machines are classified according to the number of axes that they possess, with 3, 4 and 5 axis machines all being common, and industrial robots being described with having as many as 9 axes. CNC machines are specifically successful in milling materials such as plywood, plastics, foam board, and metal at a fast speed. CNC machine beds are typically large enough to allow 4' × 8' (123 cm x 246 cm) sheets of material, including foam several inches thick, to be cut. =Laser cutter= The laser cutter is a machine that uses a laser to cut materials such as chip board, matte board, felt, wood, and acrylic up to 3/8 inch (1 cm) thickness. The laser cutter is often bundled with a driver software which interprets vector drawings produced by any number of CAD software platforms. The laser cutter is able to modulate the speed of the laser head, as well as the intensity and resolution of the laser beam, and as such is able in both to cut and to score material, as well as approximate raster graphics. Objects cut out of materials can be used in the fabrication of physical models, which will only require the assembly of the flat parts. =3D printers= 3D printers use a variety of methods and technology to assemble physical versions of digital objects. Typically desktop 3D printers can make small plastic 3D objects. They use a roll of thin plastic filament, melting the plastic and then depositing it precisely to cool and harden. They normally build 3D objects from bottom to top in a series of many very thin plastic horizontal layers. This process often happens over the course of several hours. Fused deposition modeling Fused deposition modeling, also known as fused filament fabrication, uses a 3-axis robotic system that extrudes material, typically a thermoplastic, one thin layer at a time and progressively builds up a shape. Examples of machines that use this method are the Dimension 768 and the Ultimaker. Stereolithography Stereolithography uses a high intensity light projector, usually using DLP technology, with a photosensitive polymer resin. It will project the profile of an object to build a single layer, curing the resin into a solid shape. Then the printer will move the object out of the way by a small amount and project the profile of the next layer. Examples of devices that use this method are the Form-One printer and Os-RC Illios. Selective laser sintering Selective laser sintering uses a laser to trace out the shape of an object in a bed of finely powdered material that can be fused together by application of heat from the laser. After one layer has been traced by a laser, the bed and partially finished part is moved out of the way, a thin layer of the powdered material is spread, and the process is repeated. Typical materials used are alumide, steel, glass, thermoplastics (especially nylon), and certain ceramics. Example devices include the Formiga P 110 and the Eos EosINT P730. Powder printer Powder printers work in a similar manner to SLS machines, and typically use powders that can be cured, hardened, or otherwise made solid by the application of a liquid binder that is delivered via an inkjet printhead. Common materials are plaster of paris, clay, powdered sugar, wood-filler bonding putty, and flour, which are typically cured with water, alcohol, vinegar, or some combination thereof. The major advantage of powder and SLS machines is their ability to continuously support all parts of their objects throughout the printing process with unprinted powder. This permits the production of geometries not easily otherwise created. However, these printers are often more complex and expensive. Examples of printers using this method are the ZCorp Zprint 400 and 450.

Primavera (born January 28, 1950) is an American politician who is the 50th Lieutenant Governor of Colorado. A Democrat, she previously served as the Colorado State Representative for the 33rd district from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2013 to 2017. Democratic nominee Jared Polis selected Primavera as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado in the 2018 Colorado gubernatorial election. A vocational counselor and government manager, Primavera was first elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 2006 after an unsuccessful campaign in 2004. She represented House District 33, centered around Broomfield, Colorado. In the legislature, Primavera focused heavily on health care issues. After two years out of politics, Primavera was once again elected to the statehouse in the 2012 election. She was reelected in 2014 and did not seek reelection in 2016. Early life and education Born in Denver, Colorado, Primavera earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Regis University in 1972 and a master's degree in vocational rehabilitation counseling from the University of Northern Colorado in 1975. She began her career as a case manager for the Weld County Community Center Board. She later was employed as a vocational rehabilitation counselor for the Colorado Department of Social Services, and rose to become a supervisor in the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation.  Early career  In 1990, Primavera joined the Rocky Mountain Regional Brain Injury Center as Education & Training Coordinator. In 1994, she was hired as a customer service manager for the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, a job she held until 2001. She joined the Colorado Department of Revenue in 2001, working as a director first in the Titles and Registration division, and then in Emissions and Constituent Relations from 2003 through 2004. Primavera was the conference director for the White House Conference on Aging, working with the Division of Aging and Adult Services in the Colorado Department of Human Services. She was appointed by Gov. Bill Owens to the Independent Living Council, and has been a member of State Workers Advocating for the Youth and the Medicaid Advisory Committee for Persons with Disabilities. At the time of her election to the state legislature, she was program director for Learning Services Corp. Primavera has also operated a small dog-grooming business since her teenage years. After losing reelection in 2010, Primavera served on the 17th Judicial District's Victim & Witness Assistance and Law Enforcement board as well as on the board of Susan G. Komen for the Cure. She returned to managing a small business she has run since being a teenager. Colorado House of Representatives Rep. Primavera represented House District 33 including Broomfield, Superior and part of Erie. She was elected to represent House District 33 in 2006 and 2008 and again in 2012 and 2014. = Elections = 2004 After being elected secretary of the Boulder County Democratic Party in 2003, Primavera campaigned for the state legislature against Republican Bill Berens in 2004, losing with 47% of the popular vote. 2006 She challenged Berens in 2006. Primavera received roughly $60,000 in campaign donations, outraising Berens by about two to one. Playing off her name, one of her fundraisers was titled \\"Pasta and Primavera\\", and she would sometimes distribute her father's pasta primavera recipe along with campaign literature to help voters remember her name. She prevailed in the general election with just over 51 percent support, winning by slightly less than 1000 votes. Because of the close margin, the winner of the race was not known until several days after the polls closed. 2008 Primavera filed to run for a second term in 2007; Republican Nick Kliebenstein announced his bid to seek Primavera's seat in July of that year. In a district closely balanced between Republicans and Democrats, the race between Primavera and Kliebenstein was targeted by both major parties, although by late summer 2008, Primavera had outraised Kliebenstein by roughly three to one. Her fundraising advantage continued through October, by which time she had raised over $100,000 to Kliebenstein's $30,000. During the campaign, Primavera pledged to continue her work in the area of health care reform, while Kliebenstein criticized Primavera for her support of a property tax freeze, and contrasted his support for dedicated highway funding and oil exploration with Primavera's emphasis on mass transit and alternative energy sources. Primavera's re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post the Boulder Daily Camera, the Windsor Beacon, the Broomfield Enterprise, and the Boulder Weekly. Primavera won re-election, defeating Kliebenstein by several thousand votes, or 56 percent of ballots cast, a greater margin than her first election win in 2006. 2010 Primavera's district, which contained more registered Republicans than Democrats, was one of those targeted by Colorado Republicans hoping to make gains during the midterm 2010 legislative elections. Her Republican opponent, Donald Beezley, narrowly unseated Primavera with 50.4% of the vote after receiving 314 more votes. 2012 In 2012, Primavera announced she would seek election the House district 33 seat she held through 2010. Donald Beezley, her one-time Republican opponent and the incumbent, announced his resignation from the legislature. The Republicans selected David Pigott to face Primavera in the November election. In the 2012 General Election, Pigott faced Primavera. The campaign included extensive early fundraising and a considerable get out the vote push. She defeated Pigott by a margin of 50% to 44%, with the remainder going to third-party candidates. =Tenure= 2007 In the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Primavera sat on the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee. Among Primavera's first bills were measures intended to improve patient safety by addressing mistakes made in health care administration, to revise obsolete statutes pertaining to the Colorado Department of Revenue, to regulate movers and to increase funding for health clinics. A cancer survivor, Primavera introduced legislation to establish a Colorado Breast and Women's Reproductive Cancers Fund and a donation checkoff on Colorado income tax forms for the fund, to be administered by the Colorado Cancer Coalition. She supported an unsuccessful bill to require cervical cancer vaccinations, and later introduced another bill, that was signed into law, to create a public awareness program for cervical cancer vaccinations, and require that Medicaid and private health insurance cover the costs of the vaccine. The bill also used tobacco settlement money to create a fund to provide the vaccine to underinsured women. Primavera also sponsored a successful bill to require that minors be required to wear helmets while riding motorcycles, which passed despite strong opposition from House Republicans. During the session, she was one of only a few Democrats to oppose a controversial plan by Governor Bill Ritter to freeze property tax rates to increase public school funding. In her first legislative session, Primavera introduced 13 bills, 11 of which were signed into law. For her work on health care issues, Primavera was given the Colorado Lawmaker Award by the Colorado Women's Chamber of Commerce and the Denver Women's Commission. Following the legislative session, Primavera sat on the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee. 2008 In the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Primavera sat on the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee. In February 2008, Primavera was unanimously elected vice-chair of the Legislative Audit Committee. Primavera sponsored legislation to alter the process for criminal offenders' designation as a \\"sexually violent predator;\\" under her proposal, only judges, rather than parole boards, would be able to apply the designation. She also sponsored legislation to create a tax checkoff for the Adult Stem Cells Cure Fund, designed to promote umbilical cord blood donations. Primavera was also the House sponsor of legislation to create the Colorado Autism Commission, legislation to require that health insurance the terms, costs, and benefits of their insurance plans on a public website, and legislation to earmark some tax revenues from gambling to gambling addiction prevention and counseling. 2009 For the 2009 legislative session, Primavera was named to seats on the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee, and was tapped to chair the Legislative Audit Committee. Following her re-election, Primavera stated that her legislative agenda for the 2009 session would focus on transportation and health care, including legislation to prevent insurance companies them from denying coverage for cancer patients participating in clinical trials, legislation that was signed into law. Privavera sponsored a bill to dedicate funds from purchases of Colorado's \\"Committed to a Cure\\" breast cancer awareness special license plate towards cancer treatment; the legislation led the original creators of the license plate to pull the original design from use, as they claimed the bill altered the mission of the plate; a new design will be created. For her work on health care legislation, Primavera was named a Community Health Champion by the Colorado Community Health Network in February 2009, and was honored with the Legislative Leadership Award by the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network, and honored by the Brain Injury Association of Colorado later in the year. 2010 For the 2010 legislation session, Primavera relinquished the chair of the Legislative Audit Committee to Sen. David Schultheis. Prior to the 2010 General Assembly session, Primavera announced plans to introduce legislation to shorten the time in which banks could foreclose on abandoned homes from four months to two months. 2013 Rep. Primavera sponsored a bipartisan bill extending the Colorado job growth incentive tax credit which rewards Colorado businesses for creating jobs and helps attract new businesses to the state. She also sponsored a bill allowing a nurse or qualified individual to administer an epi-pen to a student suffering anaphylactic shock.http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/hb-1171-a-real- lifesaver/Content?oid=2666920 2014 In the most recent session Rep. Primavera sponsored legislation extending the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention program through 2019.http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2014a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/2F8E7BDFADB0FC3187257C300006FA0E?Open&file;=1045_enr.pdfhttp://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/01/28/lawmaker- fighting-to-continue-breast-cancer-screening-for-low-income-women/ She also sponsored a bipartisan bill creating a tax break for small businesses with less than $15,000 in business personal property.http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/capitol_business/2014/05/at- last-a-businesspersonal-property-tax-break-is.html  Lieutenant Governor of Colorado  Primavera in October 2018 = Elections = On June 26, U.S. Representative Jared Polis defeated former State Treasurer Cary Kennedy and former State Senator Mike Johnston in the Democratic primary for the 2018 Colorado gubernatorial election. Polis received 44.4% of the vote. On July 2, 2018, Polis picked Primavera as his running mate. On November 6, 2018, Polis and Primavera defeated the Republican ticket of State Treasurer Walker Stapleton and State Representative Lang Sias, receiving 53.4% of the vote.  Personal life  In 1988, Primavera was diagnosed with breast cancer and given less than 5 years to live by physicians. She was also diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1992 and has survived a total of four bouts with cancer and has participated in the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life. Primavera, a resident of Broomfield, Colorado, has been a member of the Broomfield Health and Human Services Advisory Committee, the 17th Judicial District’s Crime Victim Compensation Board, Denver Public Schools Special Education Advisory Committee, and the boards of the Susan M. Duncan Family YMCA and Chester House.

Overview  Terms such as nationalist socialism, social nationalism and socialist nationalism are not to be confused with the German fascism espoused by the Nazi Party which called itself National Socialism. This ideology advocated the supremacy and territorial expansion of the German nation and was opposed to popular sovereignty, social equality and national self-determination for non-Germans. Unlike fascism and some forms of right-wing nationalism, left-wing nationalism does not promote the view that one nation is superior to others. Some left- wing nationalist groups, including some labourists, left liberals, orthodox Marxists, social democrats and syndicalists as well as left-leaning and centre-left parties, have historically used the term national socialism for themselves, albeit only before the rise of the Nazis or outside Europe. Since the Nazis' rise to prominence, national socialism has become associated almost exclusively with their ideas and it is rarely used in relation to left-wing nationalism in Europe, with nationalist socialism or socialist nationalism being preferred over national socialism. The unrelated German fascism National Socialism is capitalised because it refers to the Nazi entity and avoids confusion with left-wing nationalism. Notable left-wing nationalist movements include the 26th of July Movement in Cuba; the African National Congress of South Africa under Nelson Mandela; Basque nationalism and the EH Bildu coalition as well as the Catalan independence movement and the Galician nationalism and Galician Nationalist Bloc party in Spain; Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army which promoted independence of India from Britain; Labor Zionism in Israel; the League of Communists of Yugoslavia; the Malay Nationalist Party of Malaysia; the Mukti Bahini in Bangladesh; Quebec nationalism and the Parti Québécois, Québec solidaire and Bloc québécois in Canada; the Scottish National Party which promotes Scottish independence from the United Kingdom; Sinn Féin, an Irish republican party in Ireland; and the Vietcong in Vietnam. = Marxism and nationalism = Marxism identifies the nation as a socioeconomic construction created after the collapse of the feudal system which was utilized to create the capitalist economic system.Nimni 1991, 14. Classical Marxists have unanimously claimed that nationalism is a bourgeois phenomenon that is not associated with Marxism.Nimni 1991, 16. In certain instances, Marxism has supported patriotic movements if they were in the interest of class struggle, but rejects other nationalist movements deemed to distract workers from their necessary goal of defeating the bourgeoisie.Nimni 1991, 4. Marxists have evaluated certain nations to be progressive and other nations to be reactionary. Joseph Stalin supported interpretations of Marx tolerating the use of proletarian patriotism that promoted class struggle within an internationalist framework.van Ree 2002, 49. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels interpreted issues concerning nationality on a social evolutionary basis. Marx and Engels claim that the creation of the modern nation state is the result of the replacement of feudalism with the capitalist mode of production.Nimni 1991, 18. With the replacement of feudalism with capitalism, capitalists sought to unify and centralize populations' culture and language within states in order to create conditions conducive to a market economy in terms of having a common language to coordinate the economy, contain a large enough population in the state to insure an internal division of labour and contain a large enough territory for a state to maintain a viable economy. Although Marx and Engels saw the origins of the nation state and national identity as bourgeois in nature, both believed that the creation of the centralized state as a result of the collapse of feudalism and creation of capitalism had created positive social conditions to stimulate class struggle.Nimni 1991, 21. Marx followed Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's view that the creation of individual-centred civil society by states as a positive development in that it dismantled previous religious-based society and freed individual conscience. In The German Ideology, Marx claims that although civil society is a capitalist creation and represents bourgeois class rule, it is beneficial to the proletariat because it is unstable in that neither states nor the bourgeoisie can control a civil society.Nimni 1991, 21–22. Marx described this in detail in The German Ideology, stating: > Civil society embraces the whole material intercourse of individuals within > a definite stage of development of productive forces. It embraces the whole > commercial and industrial life of a given stage, and, insofar, transcends > the state and the nation, though on the other hand, it must assert itself in > its foreign relations as nationality and inwardly must organize itself as a > state. Marx and Engels evaluated progressive nationalism as involving the destruction of feudalism and believed that it was a beneficial step, but they evaluated nationalism detrimental to the evolution of international class struggle as reactionary and necessary to be destroyed.Nimni 1991, 22. Marx and Engels believed that certain nations that could not consolidate viable nation-states should be assimilated into other nations that were more viable and further in Marxian evolutionary economic progress. On the issue of nations and the proletariat, The Communist Manifesto says: > The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not > got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, > must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the > nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of > the word. National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more > and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom > of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production > and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. The supremacy of the > proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the > leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the > emancipation of the proletariat. In general, Marx preferred internationalism and interaction between nations in class struggle, saying in Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy that \\"[o]ne nation can and should learn from others\\".Nimni 1991, 7. Similarly, although Marx and Engels criticized Irish unrest for delaying a worker's revolution in England, they believed that Ireland was oppressed by Great Britain, but that the Irish people would better serve their own interests by joining proponents of class struggle in Europe as Marx and Engels claimed that the socialist workers of Europe were the natural allies of Ireland.Schmitt 1997 [1987], 169. Marx and Engels also believed that it was in Britain's best interest to let Ireland go as the Ireland issue was being used by elites to unite the British working class with the elites against the Irish. = Stalinism and revolutionary patriotism = Joseph Stalin promoted a civic patriotic concept called revolutionary patriotism in the Soviet Union. As a youth, Stalin had been active in the Georgian nationalist movement and was influenced by Ilia Chavchavadze, who promoted cultural nationalism, material development of the Georgian people, statist economy and education systems.van Ree 2002, 58–59. When Stalin joined the Georgian Marxists, Marxism in Georgia was heavily influenced by Noe Zhordania, who evoked Georgian patriotic themes and opposition to Russian imperial control of Georgia.van Ree 2002, 60. Zhordania claimed that communal bonds existed between peoples that created the plural sense of I of countries and went further to say that the Georgian sense of identity pre-existed capitalism and the capitalist conception of nationhood. After becoming a Bolshevik in the 20th century, he became fervently opposed to national culture, denouncing the concept of contemporary nationality as bourgeois in origin and accused nationality of causing retention of \\"harmful habits and institutions\\".van Ree 2002, 64. However, Stalin believed that cultural communities did exist where people lived common lives and were united by holistic bonds, claiming that there were real nations while others that did not fit these traits were paper nations.van Ree 2002, 67. Stalin defined the nation as being \\"neither racial nor tribal, but a historically formed community of people\\". Stalin believed that the assimilation of primitive nationalities like Abkhazians and Tartars into the Georgian and Russian nations was beneficial. Stalin claimed that all nations were assimilating foreign values and that the nationality as a community was diluting under the pressures of capitalism and with rising rational universality.van Ree 2002, 65. In 1913, Stalin rejected the concept of national identity entirely and advocated in favour of a universal cosmopolitan modernity. Stalin identified Russian culture as having greater universalist identity than that of other nations.van Ree 2002, 66. Stalin's view of vanguard and progressive nations such as Russia, Germany and Hungary in contrast to nations he deemed primitive is claimed to be related to Engels' views. = Titoism = The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under the rule of Josip Broz Tito and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia promoted both Marxism–Leninism and Yugoslav nationalism (Yugoslavism).Perica 2002, 98. Tito's Yugoslavia was overtly nationalistic in its attempts to promote unity between the Yugoslav nations within Yugoslavia and asserting Yugoslavia's independence. To unify the Yugoslav nations, the government promoted the concept of brotherhood and unity in which the Yugoslav nations would overcome their cultural and linguistic differences through promoting fraternal relations between the nations.Perica 2002, 99-100. This nationalism was opposed to cultural assimilation as had been carried out by the previous Yugoslav monarchy, but it was instead based upon multiculturalism.Perica 2002, 100. While promoting a Yugoslav nationalism, the Yugoslav government was staunchly opposed to any factional ethnic nationalism or domination by the existing nationalities as Tito denounced ethnic nationalism in general as being based on hatred and was the cause of war.Perica 2002, 98, 100. Balkan Idols. Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. . The League of Communists of Yugoslavia blamed the factional division and conflict between the Yugoslav nations on foreign imperialism. Tito built strong relations with states that had strong socialist and nationalist governments in power such as Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser and India under Jawaharlal Nehru. In spite of these attempts to create a left- wing Yugoslav national identity, factional divisions between Yugoslav nationalities remained strong and it was largely the power of the party and popularity of Tito that held the country together.Perica 2002, 98, 101.  By country  = Africa =  Mauritius  The Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) is a political party in Mauritius formed by a group of students in the late 1960s, advocating independence from the United Kingdom, socialism and social unity. The MMM advocates what it sees as a fairer society, without discrimination on the basis of social class, race, community, caste, religion, gender or sexual orientation. The MMM was founded in 1968 as a students' movement by Paul Bérenger, Dev Virahsawmy, Jooneed Jeeroburkhan, Chafeekh Jeeroburkhan, Sushil Kushiram, Tirat Ramkissoon, Krishen Mati, Ah-Ken Wong, Kriti Goburdhun, Allen Sew Kwan Kan, Vela Vengaroo and Amedee Darga amongst others. In 1969, it became the MMM. The party is a member of the Socialist International as well as the Progressive Alliance, an international grouping of socialist, social-democratic and labour parties. = Americas =  Latin America  Left-wing nationalism has inspired many Latin American military personnel, who are receptive to this doctrine because of the repeated interference of the United States in the political and economic affairs of their countries and the social misery in the continent. While some of the military regimes such as the Argentine dictatorship and the Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile were right-wing, left-wing soldiers seized power in Peru during the 1968 military coup and established a Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces headed by General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Although it was dictatorial in nature, it did not adopt a repressive character as the regimes mentioned above. Similarly and also in 1968, General Omar Torrijos seized power in Panama, allied himself with Cuba and the Sandinists of Nicaragua and above all led a fierce battle against the United States for the nationalisation of the Panama Canal.  North America  = Canada = In Canada, nationalism is associated with the left in the context of both Quebec nationalism and pan-Canadian nationalism (mostly in English Canada, but also in Quebec). In Quebec, the term was used by S. H. Milner and H. Milner to describe political developments in 1960s and 1970s Quebec which they saw as unique in North America. While the Liberals of the Quiet Revolution in Quebec had opposed Quebec nationalism which had been right-wing and reactionary, nationalists in Quebec now found that they could only maintain their cultural identity by ridding themselves of foreign elites, which was achieved by adopting radicalism and socialism. This ideology was seen in contrast to historic socialism, which was internationalist and considered the working class to have no homeland.Milner 1973.Milner 1989, vii. The 1960s in Canada saw the rise of a movement in favour of the independence of Quebec. Among the proponents of this constitutional option for Quebec were militants of an independent and socialist Quebec.Milner 1973, 9. Prior to the 1960s, nationalism in Quebec had taken various forms. First, a radical liberal nationalism emerged and was a dominant voice in the political discourse of Lower Canada from the early 19th century to the 1830s. The 1830s saw the more vocal expression of a liberal and republican nationalism which was silenced with the rebellions of 1837 and 1838.Pask 2001. In a now annexed Lower Canada in the 1840s, a moderately liberal expression of nationalism succeeded the old one, which remained in existence but was confined to political marginality thereafter. In parallel to this, a new Catholic and ultramontane nationalism emerged. Antagonism between the two incompatible expressions of nationalism lasted until the 1950s. According to political scientist Henry Milner, the manifestation of a third kind of nationalism became significant when intellectuals raised the issue of the economic colonization of Quebec, something the established nationalists elites had neglected to do.Milner 1973, 188. Milner identifies three distinct clusters of factors in the evolution of Quebec toward left-wing nationalism: the first cluster relates to the national consciousness of Quebecers (Québécois); the second to changes in technology, industrial organization and patterns of communication and education; and the third related to \\"the part played by the intellectuals in the face of changes in the first two factors\\".Milner 1973, 191. In English Canada, support for government intervention in the economy to defend the country from foreign (i.e. American) influences is one of Canada's oldest political traditions, going back at least to the National Policy (tariff protection) of Sir John A. Macdonald, historically be seen on both the left and the right. However, calls for more extreme forms of government involvement to forestall a putative American takeover have been a staple of the Canadian left since the 1920s and possibly earlier. Right-wing nationalism has never supported such measures, which is one of the major differences between the two. Leftist nationalism has also been more eager to dispense with historical Canadian symbols associated with Canada's British colonial heritage, such as the Canadian Red Ensign or even the monarchy (see republicanism in Canada). English Canadian leftist nationalism has historically been represented by most of Canada's socialist parties, factions with the social-democratic New Democratic Party (such as the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada in the 1960s and 1970s) and in a more diluted form in some elements of the Liberal Party of Canada (such as Trudeauism to a certain extent), manifesting itself in pressure groups such as the Council of Canadians. This type of nationalism is associated with the slogan \\"It's either the state or the States\\", coined by the Canadian Radio League in the 1930s during their campaign for a national public broadcaster to compete with the private American radio stations broadcasting into Canada, representing a fear of annexation by the United States. Right-wing nationalism continues to exist in Canada, but it tends to be much less concerned with integration into North America, especially since the Conservative Party embraced free trade after 1988. Many far-right movements in Canada are nationalist, but not Canadian nationalist, instead advocating for Western separation or union with the United States. = United States = The American Indian Movement (AIM) has been committed to improving conditions faced by native peoples. It founded institutions to address needs, including the Heart of The Earth School, the Little Earth Housing, the International Indian Treaty Council, the AIM StreetMedics, the American Indian Opportunities and the Industrialization Center (one of the largest Indian job training programs) as well as the KILI radio and the Indian Legal Rights Centers. In 1971, several members of the AIM, including Dennis Banks and Russell Means, traveled to Mount Rushmore. They converged at the mountain in order to protest the illegal seizure of the Sioux Nation's sacred Black Hills in 1877 by the United States federal government which was in violation of its earlier 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. The protest began to publicize the issues of the American Indian Movement.Miner, Marlyce. \\"The American Indian Movement\\". Archived January 10, 2014, at the Wayback Machine. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government had illegally taken the Black Hills. The government offered financial compensation, but the Oglala Sioux have refused it, insisting on return of the land to their people. The settlement money is earning interest.Ostler, Jeffrey (2010). The Lakotas and the Black Hills, The Struggle for Sacred Ground. New York, NY: Viking Penguin. p. 188. . = East Asia=  Taiwan  Taiwan's left-wing nationalist movement tends to emphasize the \\"Taiwanese identity\\" separated from China. As a result, Taiwan's left-wing nationalism takes a pro-American stand to counter Chinese imperialism, even though it has been influenced by Western socialist movements, including Leninism. = Europe = A republican mural in Belfast showing solidarity with Basque nationalism Historically, left-wing nationalists have often emerged in European states whose borders had been formed by medieval dynastic unity, bringing together multiple linguistic and ethnic groups into one single state. During the 18th and 19th centuries, those centralised states began to promote cultural homogenisation. In reaction, some regions developed their own progressive nationalism. This often occurred in regions whose cultural, economic or sociological distinctiveness from the dominant culture had produced historical grievances (political discrimination such as the Irish Penal Laws, economic crisis such as the Irish Great Famine, or traumatic war deaths). The idea could gain ground that government by distant economic or aristocratic elites was responsible for current misfortune, but that self-rule could remedy the situation by allowing a more egalitarian or state-interventionist approach, better suited to local tastes or needs, than the royal or imperial state. Left-wing nationalists have been prominent in leading the autonomist and separatist movements in the Basque Country (Basque nationalism); Catalonia (Catalan independence); Corsica (Corsican nationalism); Galicia (Galician nationalism); Ireland (Irish republicanism and Irish nationalism); Northern Ireland (Irish republicanism and Irish nationalism); Sardinia (Sardinian nationalism); Scotland (Scottish nationalism); and Wales (Welsh nationalism).  France  In Europe, a number of left-wing nationalist movements exist and have a long and well- established tradition.Frankel 1984 [1981]. Nationalism originated as a left- wing position during the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. The original left-wing nationalists endorsed civic nationalism which defined the nation as a daily plebiscite and as formed by the subjective will to live together. Related to revanchism, the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of Alsace-Lorraine, nationalism could then be sometimes opposed to imperialism. In practice, motivated by the dual idea of liberating areas from conservative rule and that those liberated peoples could be absorbed into the civic nation, French left-wing nationalism often ended up justifying or rationalising imperialism, notably in the case of Alsace. France's centralist left-wing nationalism was at times resisted by provincial left-wing groups who saw its Paris-focussed cultural and administrative centralism as little different in practice to right-wing French nationalism. From the late 19th century, several of the many ethnic groups that made up France developed a movement for separatism and regionalism, becoming a significant political factor in Alsace, Brittany, Corsica, French Flanders and the French portions of the Basque and Catalan countries, with smaller movements in other parts of the country and eventually equivalent movements in overseas territories (Algeria and New Caledonia, among others). These regional nationalisms could be either left-wing or right-wing. For instance, Occitan nationalism in the early 20th century was expressed by the far-right leaders Maurice Barrès and Charles Maurras (who imagined a right-wing Occitan regionalist identity within a multiethnic French state as a bulwark to protect conservative zones against left-wing Parisian governments) whereas the Félibriges movement represented a more progressive Occitan nationalism and looked for inspiration to the federalist republicanism of Catalonia. It was a similar situation in each of the traditionally regionalist zones, including the left-wing Breton Federalist League against the right-wing Breton National Party and the left-wing Alsatian Progress Party against the right-wing Heimatsbund, among others. Since the 1970s, a cultural revival and left-wing nationalism has grown in strength in several regions. For instance, the Pè a Corsica party has close links with both social democracy and the green movement and is currently the dominant political force in Corsica. After the 2017 legislative election, the party obtained three-quarters of Corsican seats in the National Assembly and two-thirds in the Corsican Assembly.  Ireland  Irish nationalism has been left-wing nationalism since its mainstream inception. Early nationalists during the 19th century such as the United Irishmen in the 1790s, Young Irelanders in the 1840s, Fenian Brotherhood during the 1880s and Sinn Féin and its successor Fianna Fáil in the 1920s all styled themselves in various ways after French left-wing radicalism and republicanism. This combination of nationalism with left-wing positions was possible as the nation state they sought was envisaged against the backdrop of the more socially conservative and pluri-national state of the United Kingdom. Today, parties such as Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland are left-wing nationalist parties. Earlier nationalist republican parties that were once rather more left-leaning for the time, notably Fianna Fáil in the Republic of Ireland, have over time grown more conservative (see sinistrism), today representing a centrist or centre-right republican nationalism. Right-wing nationalist outlooks and far-right parties in general were few and far between in Ireland until relatively recently. When they did emerge, it was usually short-lived and contextual (the Blueshirts during the Great Depression) or took the form of Anglo-British nationalism (as with Orangism and other tendencies within Ulster unionism). Since World War II, right-wing Irish nationalism has been a rare force in the Republic of Ireland, espoused primarily by small, often short-lived organisations and only more recently by newly registered political parties such as the National Party. As such, left-wing nationalism with a republican, egalitarian, anti- colonial tendency has historically been the dominant form of nationalism in Irish politics.  Poland  In late 19th century, Polish labour movement split into two factions, with one proposing communist revolution and Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire which established the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, renamed later as the Communist Party of Poland. However, most activists have seen Polish independence as a requirement to realize socialist political program as after Poland partitions Austria- Hungary, Prussia and Russia repressed their ethnically Polish citizens of all social classes. Those activists established Polish Socialist Party (PPS). During World War I, PPS' leader Józef Piłsudski became a leader of German dominated puppet Poland and then broke an alliance with Central Powers, claiming an independent Second Polish Republic. As a Chief of State, Piłsudski signed in very first weeks decrees about the eight hour work day, equal rights for women, free and compulsory education, free healthcare and social insurance, making Poland one of the most progressive countries of interwar period. In Poland itself, the PPS is considered pro-independence and patriotic left-wing (in contrast with the internationalist left-wing) rather than left- wing nationalist. The term nationalism is used nearly exclusively for the right-wing national democracy of Roman Dmowski and other officially far-right movements such as National Radical Camp and National Revival of Poland. Nowadays, notable parties and organizations that come the closest to the idea of a left-wing nationalism are Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland under the leadership of Andrzej Lepper and Zmiana led by Mateusz Piskorski. Both advocate patriotism, social conservatism, Euroscepticism, anti-imperialism (strong criticism of a NATO and American foreign policies) and economic nationalism. The Self-Defence won 53 seats out of 460 in 2001 elections and 56 in 2005. From 2005 to 2007, it was in the coalition government with two other parties (one right-wing and the other nationalist). Since then, it has no representatives in the Polish Sejm. It could be argued that the ruling Law and Justice party exhibits forms of left-wing nationalism. On economic issues, the party takes a hard stance against privatization and pushes for a strong state role in the market. On social issues, the party is very conservative and often alludes to the policies of the interwar sanation movement which was led by socialist Józef Piłsudski.  Scotland  The Scottish independence movement is mainly left-wing and is spearheaded by the Scottish National Party, who have been on the centre-left since the 1970s. There are other political parties from the political left in favour of Scottish independence, namely the Scottish Green Party, the Scottish Socialist Party and Solidarity.  Spain  The Anova–Nationalist Brotherhood is a Galician nationalist left-wing party that supports Galician independence from the Spanish government. In addition to national liberation, Anova defines itself as a socialist, feminist, ecologist and internationalist organization. Its internal organization is run by assemblies. Bildu is the political party that represents leftist Basque nationalism. In the north-east of Spain, there are two main political parties which defend the Catalan left-wing independentist movement, both with institutional representation, which are the Republican Left of Catalonia and Popular Unity Candidacy.  Wales  Similarly to Scotland, there is a left-wing movement in Wales led by Plaid Cymru for Welsh independence. Previously in favour of a revolutionary form of independence, Plaid now considers itself to be evolutionary in its approach to independence through continued devolution and ultimate sovereignty. This is also the view of the Wales Green Party. = Oceania =  Australia  During the 1890s, Australian-born novelists and poets such as Henry Lawson, Joseph Furphy and Banjo Paterson drew on the archetype of the Australian bushman. These and other writers formulated the bush legend which included broadly left-wing notions that working class Outback Australians were democratic, egalitarian, anti-authoritarian and cultivated mateship. However, terms like nationalist and patriotic were also utilised by pro-British Empire political conservatives, culminating with the formation in 1917 of the Nationalist Party of Australia which remained the main centre-right party until the late 1920s. During the 1940s and 1950s, radical intellectuals, many of whom joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), combined philosophical internationalism with a radical nationalist commitment to Australian culture. This type of cultural nationalism was possible among radicals in Australia at the time because of: * the patriotic turn in Comintern policy from 1941; * the most common understanding of what it meant to be patriotic at the time was a kind of pro-imperial race patriotism and anti-British sentiment was until the late 1960s regarded as subversive; and * radical nationalism dovetailed with a growing respect for Australian cultural output among intellectuals which was itself a product of the break in cultural supply chains—lead actors and scripts had always come from Britain and the United States—occasioned by the war.Stephen Alomes, A Nation at Last? (Sydney, 1988). Post-war radical nationalists consequently sought to canonise the bush culture which had emerged during the 1890s. The post-war radical nationalists interpreted this tradition as having implicitly or inherently radical qualities since they believed it meant that working-class Australians were naturally democratic and/or socialist. This view combined the CPA's commitment to the working class with the post-war intellectuals' own nationalist sentiments. The apotheosis of this line of thought was perhaps Russel Ward's book The Australian Legend (1958) which sought to trace the development of the radical nationalist ethos from its convict origins through bushranging, the Victorian gold rush, the spread of agriculture, the industrial strife of the early 1890s and its literary canonisation. Other significant radical nationalists included the historians Ian Turner, Lloyd Churchward, Robin Gollan, Geoffrey Serle and Brian Fitzpatrick, whom Ward described as the \\"spiritual father of all the radical nationalist historians in Australia\\";Russel Ward, A Radical Life (South Melbourne, 1988), 222. and the writers Stephen Murray-Smith, Judah Waten, Dorothy Hewett and Frank Hardy. The Barton Government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non- white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded. At the start of World War II, Labor Prime Minister John Curtin reinforced the message of the White Australia policy by saying: \\"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race\\". Labor Party leader Arthur Calwell supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs Be Just and Fear Not in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia, writing: > I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, > a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from > black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man > at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as > racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is > doing our nation great harm. [...] I reject, in conscience, the idea that > Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and > survive.Calwell, Be Just and Fear Not, 117. The radical-nationalist tradition was challenged during the 1960s, during which New Left scholars interpreted much of Australian history—including labour history—as dominated by racism, sexism, homophobia and militarism.Humphrey McQueen, A New Britannia (Melbourne, 1970). Since the 1960s, it has been uncommon for those on the political left to claim Australian nationalism for themselves. The bush legend has survived the above changes in Australian culture as it informed much cultural output during the period of the new nationalism in the 1970s and 1980s, the language of Australian nationalism was adopted by centre-right politicians such as Prime Minister John Howard for the political right during the 1990s.Judith Brett, Australian Liberals and the Moral Middle Class (Cambridge, 2003), 203–206. In the 21st century, attempts by left-leaning intellectuals to reclaim nationalism for the left are few and far between.David McKnight, Beyond Right and Left: New Politics and the Culture Wars (2005).Tim Soutphommasane, Reclaiming Patriotism (2009).Russell Marks, 'Labor No Longer Party of Progressive Nationalism', National Times, 19 August 2010. = South Asia =  Bangladesh  After its 1971 liberation war, Bangladesh wrote its binding beliefs to be for \\"Secularism, Nationalism and Socialism\\". For a long time, Bengali nationalism was promoted in Bangladesh while excluding other minorities which led to President Ziaur Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to change Bengali nationalism to Bangladeshi nationalism where all citizens of the country is equal under the law. This new nationalism in Bangladesh has been promoted by the BNP and the Awami League calling for national unity and cultural promotion. However, the BNP would later promote Islamic unity as well and has excluded Hindus from the national unity while bringing together Bihari Muslims and Chakma Buddhists. This is different from Awami League's staunch secularist stance of the national identity uniting all religious minorities. = West Asia =  Turkey  The Enlightenment Movement (Aydınlık Hareketi) has been synonymous with left-wing nationalism. This has been advocated by the Patriotic Party.

The story is about Jewish Nazi hunters who find a fictional Adolf Hitler (A.H.) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II. The book was controversial, particularly among reviewers and Jewish scholars, because the author allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors. There Hitler maintains that Israel owes its existence to the Holocaust and that he is the \\"benefactor of the Jews\\". The novella was first published in a literary magazine, The Kenyon Review in 1979. After some minor revisions by Steiner, it was published in the United Kingdom in May 1981 as a paperback original by Faber and Faber, and in the United States in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster. Adapted for the theatre by British playwright Christopher Hampton, it was staged in London in 1982 and in Hartford, Connecticut a year later. The productions generated further controversy, resulting in public pickets and condemnation being levelled against Steiner. A central theme of The Portage is the nature of language, and revolves around Steiner's lifelong work on the subject and his fascination in the power and terror of human speech. Other themes include the philosophical and moral analysis of history, justice, guilt and revenge. Steiner makes no attempt to explain Hitler, but rather enters into a dialogue with him. Reaction to the book was mixed: in a review in Time magazine, Otto Friedrich described it as \\"a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity\\", whereas John Leonard of The New York Times called Hitler's speech at the end of the book \\"obscene\\", and said Steiner's decision to leave it unchallenged \\"makes me sick to my stomach.\\" Similarly, many readers and theatre-goers were disturbed by Steiner's fictional Hitler, and the author admitted that his character had got the better of him. Despite the controversy, The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. was a 1983 finalist in the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Plot From his base in Tel Aviv, Holocaust survivor Emmanuel Lieber directs a group of Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms. Meanwhile, broken and incoherent radio messages between Lieber and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice (\\"You must not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other\\") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness. The attention Hitler receives renews his strength, and when the trial begins, he brushes aside his \\"defence attorney\\" and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence: # First, Hitler claims he took his doctrines from the Jews and copied the notion of the master race from the Chosen people and their need to separate themselves from the \\"unclean\\". \\"My racism is a parody of yours, a hungry imitation.\\" # Next, Hitler justifies the Final Solution by maintaining that the Jews' God, purer than any other, enslaves His subjects, continually demanding more than they can give and \\"blackmailing\\" them with ideals that cannot be attained. The \\"virus of utopia\\" had to be stopped. # Hitler then states that he was not the originator of evil. \\"[Stalin] had perfected genocide\\" (Soviet famine of 1932–33) \\"when I was still a nameless scribbler in Munich.\\" Further, Hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his actions are dwarfed by various world atrocities, including those in Russia, China and Africa. # Finally, Hitler maintains that the Reich begat Israel and suggests that he is the Messiah \\"whose infamous deeds were allowed by God in order to bring His people home.\\" He closes by asking, \\"Should you not honour me who have made ... Zion a reality?\\" At the end of his speech, Teku, who \\"had not understood the words, only their meaning\\", is the first to react and jumps up shouting \\"Proven\\". But he is drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing. Main characters * Emmanuel Lieber – Jewish Holocaust survivor and director of the search party to find Hitler; after crawling out of a death pit in Bialka he never took the time to mend and embarked on a life-consuming obsession to bring those responsible for the genocide to justice. * Search party (all Jewish with family ties to the Holocaust, except for John Asher) ** Simeon – search party leader and \\"presiding judge\\" at Hitler's trial; he is Lieber's confidant and torn between leading the party into \\"unmapped quicksand and green bogs\\" and turning his back on the \\"quiet mania of Lieber's conviction\\". ** Gideon Benasseraf – falls ill and dies before the trial begins; during one of his fever-induced ramblings he suggests that Hitler is Jewish; he had sought out Lieber after being released from a sanatorium and spending three years recuperating in Paris where the care-free living consumed him with guilt. ** Elie Barach – Orthodox Jew and \\"prosecution attorney\\" at the trial; he is the moral compass of the group, but his convictions are disturbed by Gideon Benasseraf's fever-induced assertions that Hitler is Jewish and ends up believing that Hitler may be the second Messiah. ** Isaac Amsel – an 18-year-old boy and witness at the trial; he is the son of Isaac Amsel senior, former member of the search party killed earlier in a skirmish in São Paulo; he joined the party to avenge his father's death. ** John Asher – half-Jewish and reluctant \\"defence attorney\\" at the trial; fascinated by the capture of Martin Bormann and the rumours circulating that Hitler may be alive, he had approached Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal who directed him to Lieber; despite being an \\"outsider\\" (no ties to the Holocaust) Lieber assigned him to the search party because of his military training and his clear-headedness (\\"no metaphysical lusts, no cravings for retribution\\"). * Teku – local Indian tracker and independent witness at the trial; previously the search party's guide who had abandoned them when they insisted on entering uncharted regions of the jungle, he continued tracking them from a distance before revealing himself. * Adolf Hitler – now 90 years old, the former leader of the Third Reich had not died in the Führerbunker in Berlin, but escaped to South America and hid in the Amazon jungle. Background and publication alt=A head-and-shoulders photograph of an elderly man standing at a lectern and speaking George Steiner, academic, philosopher, writer and literary critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times, had written about the Holocaust in some of his previous books, including Anno Domini (1964), Language and Silence (1967) and In Bluebeard's Castle (1971). Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. were drawn from these earlier works. Steiner told New York Times editor D. J. R. Bruckner that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language. \\"Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my astonishment ... that you can use human speech both to bless, to love, to build, to forgive and also to torture, to hate, to destroy and to annihilate.\\" Steiner wrote The Portage in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva, Switzerland, and the 120-page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the US literary magazine, The Kenyon Review. An abridged version was published in the Spring 1980 issue of Granta, the British literary magazine. Its first publication in book form, with minor revisions by Steiner, was in May 1981 by Faber and Faber in the UK and, as requested by Steiner, it was a paperback original. The first US edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster. The Portage has been translated into several languages, including French, German, Hebrew, Italian and Swedish. Commenting on the controversy the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) that he too was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had got the better of him, \\"golem- or Frankenstein-like\\". He said that it felt like the book \\"wrote me\\". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: \\"My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can.\\" In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella \\"my foremost business\\". Stage adaptations The only work of fiction by Steiner to have been adapted for the stage, The Portage was reworked in 1982 by British playwright Christopher Hampton. It was staged in April 1982 at London's Mermaid Theatre under the direction of John Dexter with Alec McCowen playing the part of Adolf Hitler. McCowen won the 1982 Evening Standard Theatre Award for best actor for this performance. The production generated \\"a storm of controversy\\". In \\"Stage Nazis: The Politics and Aesthetics of Memory\\", Robert Skloot described the play as \\"a rarely articulated fantasy about the causes of genocide\\" that \\"test[s] the limits of personal tolerance\\". He wrote that Steiner was \\"intentionally provocative\\" in choosing Hitler for the search party to pursue, and Hampton exploited this by giving the former Führer 25 minutes to present his case. Skloot added that while Hitler's speech is \\"a hodgepodge of misinformation, mendacity and slander\\", its delivery is captivating. In 1983 the production moved to the US where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford, Connecticut, directed by Mark Lamos and starring John Cullum as Hitler. At this premiere, Cullum's 25-minute speech at the end of the play was described by Mel Gussow in The New York Times as \\"a Wagnerian intensity without resorting to histrionics\\" that \\"almost succeeds in that most difficult of tasks—humanizing Hitler\\". In World Literature Today, Bettina L. Knapp wrote that the play presented theatre-goers with the dilemma: what would you do with Hitler were he to surface today? Skloot noted that while the \\"facts\\" in Steiner's work are pure fiction, the play confronts the audience with an event that cannot be resolved with traditional \\"logic, facticity and morality\\". Responding to theatre critics who objected to Hitler having the last word, Steiner said he wanted the audience to refute the former dictator's claims themselves. Controversy The Portage generated considerable controversy because of its apparent \\"admiration for Hitler\\". The controversy grew further when the stage adaptation of the book (\\"too faithful\\", according to Steiner) was performed in the UK and the US. Hitler's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics. Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past, he allows him the (almost) last word before the outside world invades. The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious. One critic, while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as \\"the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil\\", felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner's own views and those of his fictional Hitler, even going so far as to accuse Steiner, who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, of anti-Semitism. In contrast, a Time magazine article felt that Steiner's intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his belief \\"that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force\\". Steiner articulated this in Lieber's warning in the book that \\"there shall come a man [who] ... will know the grammar of hell and ... will know the sounds of madness and loathing and make them seem music.\\" Menachem Z. Rosensaft, chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Survivors, said that \\"Nothing in [The Portage] was a trivialization of the Holocaust or a whitewash\\". Rosenbaum remarked that as Hitler's trial in the book ended, so Steiner's trial began, with \\"manifold and stinging\\" accusations levelled against him, \\"from the artistic to the personal\\". The dramatisation of the novel and the subsequent stage performances escalated the criticism, and led to public pickets. By letting Hitler's \\"long, insidious, subversive, and disturbing speech\\" go unchallenged, Steiner was accused of \\"playing with fire\\". One of Steiner's most prominent critics, British Jewish scholar Hyam Maccoby said: > In a world historically receptive to any anti-Semitic argument, however > crude, to put in Hitler's mouth a powerful rationale for blaming the Jews, > however ironically, was feeding the same fires that sent Jews up the > chimneys of the death camps. One of the biggest criticisms Steiner received was that he himself believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was also thought that at the end of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play. Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in the book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before: for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov (1880). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler (A.H.) is \\"a fictive figure\\", and that it is not he who has the last word, but Teku, the Indian tracker, who shouts \\"Proven\\". Dominick LaCapra said that Teku's declaration is ambiguous, meaning either Hitler has proved his innocence or his guilt. Steiner explained this ambiguity by adding that Teku is the Hebrew word used to indicate that \\"there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide.\\" Reception Reaction to The Portage was mixed. Anthony Burgess in The Observer called it \\"astonishing\\", Christopher Booker of The Daily Telegraph described it as a \\"powerful piece\\", and English author A. S. Byatt said it was a \\"masterpiece\\". In Explaining Hitler (1998), Rosenbaum called The Portage \\"A Frankenstein story\\", referring to Steiner's fictive Hitler having taken on a life of its own. Writing in Time magazine, Otto Friedrich described the book as \\"a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity\\", adding that by not refuting Hitler's speech, Steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book \\"on a note of bleak ambiguity\\". Morris Dickstein of The New York Times was more critical of the book, calling it \\"a misconceived and badly executed novel, a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era.\\" He described it as \\"wearisome\\", and \\"suffocate[d]\\" by too much \\"fine writing\\" (belles-lettres). He also complained that the characters are lifeless, and while they each have detailed histories, they are only \\"verbal figments\\" that do not separate them from one another. Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler's speech are drawn from some of Steiner's earlier works, he \\"unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant—at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous.\\" In another review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points, \\"some wit, a catholic disdain, multiplicity of character and a South American swamp-life that terrifies\\", its weaknesses are that \\"the characters are really ideas, ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by Kafka and Proust\\". But Leonard's biggest criticism of the book was Hitler's speech, which he called \\"obscene\\", and Steiner's decision to end the book at that point, which Leonard said \\"not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend, but ... makes me sick to my stomach.\\" Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi, Alvin H. Rosenfeld called The Portage a \\"breakthrough work\\" that \\"astonishes\\". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the \\"landscape of speech\\"—the former being \\"brilliantly registered\\" with its \\"immense feeling of physicality\\", and the latter, \\"even more dramatic\\" in the way it exposes \\"the dark underside of words\\" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness. Rosenfeld noted that while Holocaust literature often either soars to \\"expostulation and apostrophe\\", or sinks to \\"a dwindling sob of elegiac lament\\", Steiner's Lieber \\"mediates between these two extremes, ... simultaneously records and mourns, coldly enumerates yet carries an immense affect\\". What concerned the reviewer was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works, that he had put them \\"virtually verbatim\\" into Hitler's mouth, creating the impression that \\"Steiner's understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter's self-understanding\\". Rosenfeld also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler's speech. He said that Steiner's fictive Hitler plays \\"the devil's game of language subversion\\", making \\"madness [sound] like music\\", something the real Hitler had perfected. By stopping at this point, Rosenfeld felt that Steiner \\"succumb[s], rhetorically, to the seductive eloquence of negation\\", which undermines his own \\"high standards of moral intelligence\\". But overall Rosenfeld said The Portage \\"must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler\\", forcing us to confront him \\"in a way hardly seen before in fiction\\". The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. was a finalist in the 1983 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Themes A central theme of The Portage is the nature of language. Rosenbaum says that Steiner's \\"fascination and ... distrust of speech, the love and hate for the power and terror of language, has been at the very heart of [his] remarkable career as literary prodigy and prodigal.\\" Steiner told Rosenbaum that \\"in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, in a way that is perhaps a little bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in a most unusual way\\". Hitler's genius lay \\"not so much in the written word, but the embodied voice\\", which Steiner described as \\"mesmeric\\". Rosenbaum notes that Steiner describes Hitler as \\"a kind of medium for the evil genius of the German language itself\\" and that his language is \\"like 'antimatter' to ordinary language\\". Margaret Burton sees the language in the book as polarised between \\"a venue for truth\\" and \\"a source of destruction\\", with Lieber representing the former, and Hitler the latter. Bryan Cheyette considers that Steiner is not contrasting Lieber and Hitler, but is \\"portraying them as part of the same dialect\\", and that they reflect a dichotomy in Steiner himself. Alexander M. Sidorkin argues that Steiner's approach to Hitler was not to attempt to explain him, but rather to \\"enter ... into a dialogue\\" with him, a \\"dialogue with evil\\". Sidorkin suggests that Steiner had to \\"explore his own inner Hitler\\", his suppressed prejudices, to bring Hitler's speech to life. Other themes in The Portage include the philosophical and moral analysis of history, justice, guilt and revenge. Having captured one of the world's greatest enemies, his Jewish captors are forced to examine their feelings on the situation they find themselves in. Hitler's historical significance features prominently in the book, and the recurring questions surrounding the meaning of Hitler, which Steiner makes no attempt to answer, surface periodically. Norwegian literary scholar Jakob Lothe felt that Steiner's attempts to dramatise these complex issues fail because his fiction \\"is too poor\\" for it to be effective.

In 1922, a portion of the Center Turnpike was designated as State Highway 151, which began at New England Route 32, and followed Turnpike Road, Boston Hollow Road, Centre Pike, and Old Turnpike Road to the Massachusetts state line. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, old Highway 151 was renumbered to Route 197, following the old Center Turnpike alignment. In 1941, the western end was truncated to a point in Ashford west of Route 89. In 1947, the western end was truncated to Route 169 in Woodstock.

The band's major influences were Slayer, Metallica and Anthrax. Fantom Warior had a self-distributed demo and album as well as appearing on a compilation album. Fantom Warior's musical style was said to be hardcore thrash similar to Slayer and Kreator with changes throughout their songs that mix speedcore and very heavy thrash. Their music contained a blend of speed and technical development unknown to some of the other bands of their time. History Fantom Warior started as a heavy metal cover band under the name Phantom Lord in 1984 in Union, New Jersey. The original lineup featured guitarist Keith Pires, drummer James Jensen, bass guitarist John Chernack, guitarist Steve Schley and vocalist Dave Montini. The band had a number of lead vocalists, most notably Jason Glicken (alias Raeph Glicken) who continued his music career as a drummer for a number of hardcore punk bands such as S.F.A., Kill Your Idols and The Arsons, as well as the black metal band Black Anvil. In early 1985, the lineup of John Chernack, Keith Pires, James Jensen, and Steve Schley, with Chernack and Pires taking on vocal frontmen duties, changed the band name to Fantom Warior due to the emergence of another New York band using the name Phantom Lord. The group's first live performance as Fantom Warior was at the Show Place in Dover, New Jersey, in May 1985. In March, 1986, Fantom Warior released a five track demo tape containing original material entitled \\"Morbid Invasion\\". It was distributed worldwide and was well received by a number of metal magazines in both the US and in Europe. Critic Esben Slot Sorensen of the Danish metal magazine Blackthorn wrote \\"This is a killer demo! Fantom Warior will be a very possible subject for the 'demo of the year 1986' poll ... you must take a look on the cover just to assure you that it is not Tom Araya who's singing\\". Critic Mike Exley for the UK metal magazine Metal Forces wrote \\"Morbid Invasion is both a classic and a must for true metal fans and bands to listen to ... Morbid Invasion leads off with a solid riff, but it's the middle section of this song that has me foaming at the mouth\\". Writer Andrew Sakowicz from the Chapel magazine felt that with bands like Fantom Warior, \\"the East Coast is finally a scene to be reckoned with\\". In April, 1987, Fantom Warior was one of nine artists of varying musical genres to appear on a compilation album distributed by Merlin Recording Studios. The record album entitled Merlin Music Presents . . . featured a track from Fantom Warior entitled \\"E.R.C.\\" (Eat the Rotting Corpse) which did not appear on their \\"Morbid Invasion\\" demo. In October, 1987, Fantom Warior released a ten track record album entitled \\"Fantasy Or Reality\\", distributed under the band's independent label Token Records. This album, like the Morbid Invasion demo, was also distributed and sold directly by the band via mail order and local music stores throughout New Jersey and New York. Predating the popularity of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, Fantom Warior, like many other 1980s metal bands, established a worldwide fan base with the help of reviews and articles that appeared in the metal magazines and the underground metal fanzine networks. The publishing of Fantom Warior's contact information in these articles, initially in the UK Magazine, Metal Forces, and then the Dutch magazine, Blackthorne, as well as many other regional fanzines, helped jump start Fantom Warior's worldwide distribution of the Morbid Invasion demo, the Fantasy Or Reality album, and other merchandise. Although the Fantom Warior name and music spread worldwide, Fantom Warior played primarily in venues in New Jersey and New York. Fantom Warior was known to co- headline performances with another Union, New Jersey, metal band, Insaniac. The lack of professional management and touring that would have come with a contract with a major label as well as the downturn of thrash metal during the late 1980s made it difficult for unsigned bands, such as Fantom Warior, to thrive. The group eventually disbanded in 1989. Fantom Warior reunited in 2012 and has begun working on a new album scheduled to be released late 2015. Fantom Warior has played multiple shows since reuniting including venues with Raven, Black Anvil, Exhumer, Bloodfeast, Malevolent Creation, Prime Evil, Antichrist, Impaler, Deceased, Obliteration just to name a few. Fantom Warior performed as Direct Support on June 10th, 2014 for Grim Reaper at St Vitus in Brooklyn NY to kick-off their North America Tour. Fantom Warior provided support for former part-time member Raeph Glicken's band Black Anvil at their record release party on July 20th, 2014 at St Vitus in Brooklyn. Fantom Warior recently headlined their last show on 8/29 at St Vitus with 4 other bands on the bill. At the end of 2014, Fantom Warior released THE ARCHIVE CD which contains all of their music on one CD remastered. On March 17th, Fantom Warior released a Limited Edition Vinyl of the Classic Demo Morbid Invasion through Electric Assault Records. Discography *Morbid Invasion (demo, 1986) *Merlin Music Presents...

Smith. It was published in 1956 by Gnome Press in an edition of 4,000 copies. The novel was originally serialized in the magazine Imagination in 1955. An abridged version was published by Avon Books in 1957 under the title Space Plague. Plot The novel concerns ESP and a disease that turns men into supermen. It contains multiple plotlines concerning the interactions of people that can sense things (espers) and people that can read thoughts (telepaths). This is set against the plot of a secret society that is harboring people that are infected with a spaceborne illness called Mekstrom's Disease. The disease is the point on which the plot turns. People get infected and it slowly turns them into a sort of rock. The hardening begins at one of the extremities such as a finger or toe and slowly begins to creep up the infected limb. Eventually all the extremities are hardening and the disease makes its way to the body proper. At this point, the body is hardened until the vitals fail and the patient dies. The plot turns on a secret society that has found a cure for the infected. To hide themselves from the public at large they have devised a hidden highway program that leads the infected to \\"Mekstrom safehouses\\" of sorts. Reception J. Francis McComas found Highways in Hiding to be \\"a tasty enough dish for those on a diet of pure melodrama,\\" concluding that \\"Our hero's adventures go on a bit too long, but over all, his exploits are entertaining.\\"\\"Spacemen's Realm,\\" New York Times, November 18, 1956 Galaxy reviewer Floyd C.

Hill Sr. (born 1956) was the ringleader of the largest mortgage fraud scheme ever prosecuted in the State of Georgia. Hill was found guilty of 168 counts of fraud and money laundering on March 14, 2007 in the Northern District of Georgia. On September 21, 2007, U.S. District Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr. sentenced Hill to prison for 28 years. Hill is currently incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution in Marianna, Florida, a medium security facility housing male inmates. His projected release date is August 2, 2031. During his trial, prosecutors identified Hill as the ringleader in three interlocking mortgage fraud schemes built on metro-Atlanta real estate sales that, between 2001 and 2003, bilked lenders out of more than $40 million. According to the evidence at trial, Hill was the owner and operator of \\"We Build Atlanta, Inc.,\\" \\"The Estate Firm, Inc.,\\" \\"Estate Artistians of Georgia, Inc.,\\" \\"Estates Atlanta, Inc.,\\" and numerous other Georgia corporations. Hill controlled the affairs of each such corporation. Hill held himself out to be a real estate developer, and either individually or through one or more of the corporations he controlled, purchased and sold numerous residential properties in the Atlanta area. Hill oversaw the conspiracy, loan fraud, wire and mail fraud and money laundering activity related to mortgages obtained in the sale of over 50 homes and over 250 condominiums in eight Atlanta-area condominium complexes. These properties were all owned at one time by one of the Hill entities. Each property was sold at an inflated price to a \\"straw purchaser\\" who applied for a mortgage loan based upon the inflated price. The straw purchasers who participated in these mortgage flips were paid a kick-back out of the excess loan proceeds for the use of their name and credit. The victim-lenders granted the loans based upon numerous false representations and documents regarding the credit qualifications of the straw purchaser, as well as false representations that the straw purchaser had paid a down payment, would reside in the home, and would be responsible for the loan payment. In addition, the lenders were induced to make the loans based on fraudulently inflated appraisals. Some of the properties were \\"flipped\\" more than one time. After a five-year investigation, a federal grand jury in 2005 charged Hill and 24 co-defendants, including real estate appraisers, closing attorneys, mortgage brokers, loan officers and straw purchasers, in an expanding indictment that eventually included 187 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, bank credit fraud, money-laundering, bribery of a bank official and criminal conspiracy. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara E. Nelan, the fraud ring's property schemes were based on the unlawful \\"flipping\\" of residential real estate. Illegal real property flipping is a fraud for profit scheme whereby recently acquired real property is resold for a considerable profit with an artificially inflated value. The real property is resold within a short time frame, often after making only cosmetic improvements to the real property. Illegal property flipping usually often involves collusion between a real estate appraiser, a mortgage originator and a closing agent. The cooperation of a real estate appraiser is necessary since a false and artificially inflated appraisal report is required. The buyer (ultimate borrower) may or may not be aware of the situation. This type of fraud is one of the most costly for lenders because the loss is always large. One of the three fraud schemes involved sales of more than 50 luxury estates in several of metro Atlanta's \\"country club\\" subdivisions and more than 250 condominiums in eight complexes in Dunwoody, Buckhead, Midtown and downtown Atlanta. A second scheme focused on sales at grossly inflated prices of 27 lots in the Cascade Oaks subdivision in southwest Atlanta. Centrum Financial Services Inc., which financed the $1.3 million deal, and was a victim of the scheme, eventually was forced to foreclose on those properties. The third scheme—in which Hill joined with a former bank officer who has already been sentenced for his role—defrauded Charter Bank & Trust Co. in Marietta, Georgia of $170,000. United States Attorney David Nahmias said, \\"The negative impact on our neighborhoods of this multimillion dollar fraud scheme extends far beyond the financial loss to the victim lenders. The Phillip Hill mortgage fraud scheme charged in this indictment is the most extensive this office and federal investigative agencies have uncovered to date in the Atlanta area. This indictment is a major step forward in this office's commitment to expose and eradicate mortgage fraud schemes in our community.\\" Co-defendants who were also found guilty of multiple felony charges include Marcus Alcindor, a/k/a Christopher Alcindor of St. Lucia; Barbara Brown, a/k/a Barbara Eubanks, a real estate appraiser from Marietta, Georgia; Fred Farmer, a real estate appraiser from Roswell, Georgia; Christine Laudermill; Robert Powers of Cumming, Georgia; David Thomas of Hammond, Louisiana; and Dean Thomas and David Van Mersbergen, both of Atlanta, Georgia. In addition to the defendants found guilty at trial, several other individuals pleaded guilty to mortgage fraud charges related to the same scheme before trial. These defendants include William Chavis of Atlanta, Georgia; Michael Flake of Stone Mountain, Georgia; Wesley Golden of Atlanta, Georgia; Christopher Halcomb, a former closing attorney from Cumming, Georgia who was disbarred by the State Bar of Georgia; Cortney Jackson of Detroit, Michigan; Wayne Jenkins, a mortgage broker from Atlanta, Georgia; Rashid Muhammad of Syracuse, New York; Julian Perez, a/k/a Tony Perez, a real estate appraiser from Roswell, Georgia; Brant Petree of Marietta, Marietta, Georgia; Theodore Tagalakis a mortgage broker from Atlanta, Georgia; and Andrew Wolf of Alpharetta, Georgia, a former closing attorney who voluntarily surrendered his license to the State Bar of Georgia on October 29, 2007 in lieu of disbarment. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office and the information presented in court, Leslie Rector was Hill's right-hand man. U.S. District Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr. sentenced Leslie Rector to seven years in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release for his participation in the massive mortgage fraud scheme that targeted the Atlanta area housing and condo market from 2000 through part of 2003. Judge Thrash also ordered Rector to pay $40.2 million in restitution.

The trail extends from U.S. Route 20 in Hancock, Massachusetts, less than east of the New York border, north along the ridgecrest of the Taconic Range, first within Massachusetts, then weaving along the border of New York and Massachusetts and New York and Vermont, and ending in Petersburgh, New York, on NY Route 346, near the Vermont border. Much of the route has been conserved as state forest, conservation easement, or forest preserve. Forest types on the Taconic Crest Trail are mixed oak- hickory forest and northern hardwood forest with microclimate summit balds, alkaline-loving plant communities, and red spruce/ balsam fir stands on the higher summits. The geology is thrust faulted metamorphic rock over younger sedimentary rock. The Taconic Crest Trail passes through the New York towns of Stephentown, Berlin and Petersburgh; the Massachusetts towns of Hancock and Williamstown; and Pownal, Vermont. It is crossed by New York Route 2, Massachusetts Route 43, the seasonal Pittsfield State Forest Berry Pond Campground access road, and by Lebanon Springs Road in Hancock. The trail is supported by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the Taconic Hiking Club, the Trust for Public Land, the National Park Service, Williams College, Rensselaer Land Trust, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, and the Williamstown Rural Lands Foundation. Trail details The trail utilizes two distinct ridgelines of the Taconic Mountains. From Route 20 north, the trail passes through Pittsfield State Forest in Massachusetts; features include the highland Cranberry Pond and Twin Ponds, Doll Mountain, Smith Mountain, Tower Mountain, and Berry Pond, , reputedly the highest pond in Massachusetts. A state campground is located at Berry Pond. From Berry Pond, the trail descends the ridgeline into the village of Hancock, Massachusetts, then ascends the second ridge, which straddles the New York border. Features along this section include Rounds Mountain, Misery Mountain, Berlin Mountain (the trail's high point), Mount Raimer, White Rock, and a crevasse called the Snow Hole where ice has been known to persist year round. The trail utilizes conservation land and easements including the Taconic Ridge State Forest (NYSDEC) and Hopkins Memorial Forest, owned and managed by Williams College. The trail is marked with blue squares containing white blazes throughout its length. All NYSDEC portions of the trail are also posted with blue DEC markers. The trail follows a series of high, open summits and ridgeline overlooking the Hudson River Valley to the west. The entirety of the trail is open to hiking, backpacking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and backcountry skiing, and many sections permit mountain biking, horseback riding and snowmobiling as well. Overnight camping is allowed on the trail; a seasonal campground with facilities is located at Berry Pond. The Taconic Crest Trail originally extended from Berry Pond in Pittsfield State Forest to North Pownal, Vermont. In the late 1990s, the Taconic Skyline Trail in Pittsfield State Forest was separated into two parallel trails: one retained the name \\"Taconic Skyline\\" and was designated a motorized recreation trail; the other trail was added on to the southern end of the Taconic Crest Trail, extending it by . To the north, in Vermont, the Taconic Crest Trail once extended into North Pownal, but was closed by request of a property owner; the trail terminus was re-routed north to a newly constructed DEC trailhead at NY Route 346 in North Petersburgh, New York. Not visible from the road, the new trailhead shares a driveway with a private residence and with an old, barred forest road, which are visible; box 25, on the south side of 346, marks the trailhead entrance. It is west of the \\"Entering NY\\" sign and from the railroad tracks. A NYSDEC access trail, marked yellow, still leads down to the former terminus of the trail, at the old Prosser Hollow trailhead.

Kaufman. Produced by Universal Pictures it starred William Powell as a dim- witted U.S. senator who decides to run for president, with Ella Raines as a reporter interested in the detailed diary he has kept about all the political misdeeds of his colleagues. Powell won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performances in this film and in Life with Father. The film also was known as Mr. Ashton Was Indiscreet (see photo). Plot The inept, slow-witted U.S. Senator Melvin G. Ashton wants to run for President of the United States. His eager publicist, Lew Gibson, encourages him with various attention-gaining stunts, disappointing his girlfriend Poppy McNaughton, a reporter for a local newspaper. When Ashton arrives at his hotel in New York City, Gibson asks him to accept membership into the Cherokee tribe, purely for publicity. Ashton eagerly agrees. Fred Houlihan, a political boss, asks Ashton to step down as a presidential candidate. Ashton refuses, but in a long speech publicly and consistently denies he is running for president. The stunning Valerie Shepherd arrives and decides to join the campaign. Lew becomes attracted to her. Appalled by Ashton's baffling incompetence, Poppy breaks up with Lew. Articles about Ashton's road to the presidency are published in the newspapers. Houlihan again tries to persuade him not to run. However, Ashton blackmails Houlihan into silence, telling him he has kept a diary of scandalous party activity for the past thirty years. Ashton embarks on a cross-country tour to court voters, becomes a popular candidate, and returns to speak at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Ashton discovers his diary is missing, and suspects the communist hotel room service clerk Karl has stolen it. However, Lew suspects the thief was Poppy. Ashton's former secretary, Robert Oakes, is soon found with the diary, but he insists someone else stole it before he got hold of it. Lew finds out that Valerie's beau Bill Fisher is Ashton's political enemy and has started a petition to investigate the senator in his home state. From various clues, Poppy deduces that Valerie stole the diary. Aware that the explosive diary is missing, Houlihan again asks Ashton to step down, at which point Ashton agrees to do so if they find him another job. They offer to get him appointed commissioner of a professional sports league, a job that pays twice the salary of the President of the U.S. Poppy manages to retrieve the diary from Valerie, but loses it to Lew, who tells Ashton the good news. Houlihan then tries to convince Ashton to get back into the race, but Ashton hesitates. Lew then decides that the truth should be revealed and gives the diary back to Poppy. When it is published, both Ashton and his bosses are forced to flee to a South Sea island, where Ashton soon becomes chief of the native population. Cast *William Powell as Senator Melvin G.

Tarski asked if the sum of the widths of the planks must be at least the minimum width of the convex region. The question was answered affirmatively by . Statement 320px Given a convex body C in Rn and a hyperplane H, the width of C parallel to H, w(C,H), is the distance between the two supporting hyperplanes of C that are parallel to H. The smallest such distance (i.e. the infimum over all possible hyperplanes) is called the minimal width of C, w(C). The (closed) set of points P between two distinct, parallel hyperplanes in Rn is called a plank, and the distance between the two hyperplanes is called the width of the plank, w(P). Tarski conjectured that if a convex body C of minimal width w(C) was covered by a collection of planks, then the sum of the widths of those planks must be at least w(C). That is, if P1,…,Pm are planks such that :C\\\\subseteq P_1\\\\cup\\\\ldots\\\\cup P_m\\\\subset \\\\R^n, then :\\\\sum_{i=1}^m w(P_i)\\\\geq w(C). Bang proved this is indeed the case. Nomenclature The name of the problem, specifically for the sets of points between parallel hyperplanes, comes from the visualisation of the problem in R2. Here, hyperplanes are just straight lines and so planks become the space between two parallel lines. Thus the planks can be thought of as (infinitely long) planks of wood, and the question becomes how many planks does one need to completely cover a convex tabletop of minimal width w? Bang's theorem shows that, for example, a circular table of diameter d feet can't be covered by fewer than d planks of wood of width one foot each.

The Napoleonic code is the French civil code which was issued between 1804 and 1810. It clearly presents the French legal system. Belgium’s constitution is influenced by earlier constitutions of the French and the Netherlands. Belgium became an independent state in 1830 with the help of British government and there were restrictions on the parliamentary system of Belgium government. The language differences in Belgium have caused governmental and constitutional problems. Official languages are French, Dutch and German, which has official status in one district only. Parliamentary democracy usually ends up becoming a coalition government. Belgium is a federal state and has a civil law system.  History  An ancien régime outdoor court, reconstructed at Bokrijk based on an original at Oudenaarde The Belgian state was formed as a constitutional monarchy in 1830, after a long period of domination by France, from 1714 to 1814. Belgium endeavored to make changes and amendments in their legal system which are mostly in French, Dutch and German. This change started to produce satisfactory results from the early industrialization in the 19th century. The major clauses generally have remained unaltered. French codes are the typical example of a legal system in Belgium affected by conquests of France. It was implemented in Belgium after Napoleon conquests in 1795. This remained unchanged since Belgium became a state in 1830. Law system in Belgium gradually developed with constitutional reforms since 1970. Belgium has applied European legislation and given regard to decisions of the European Court of Justice. Also, Belgium signed the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in November 1950, which is the day of its adoption, and finally ratified it in June 1955.Belgium also accepted the individual complaints procedure a few weeks after ratification, in July 1955.  Constitution  Flag of Belgium Belgium became independent in 1830 after Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo and Southern Netherlands. The constitution of Belgium is officially proclaimed by the first Belgian parliament with the Belgian constitutional law. However, Belgium's legal system after 20 years of French occupation was totally in French. Majority of sources were from the constitution of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and most of the sources were copied from French texts. The new constitution of Belgium was not significantly insufficient with Belgium’s original sources. Thus, the lawyers in Belgium claimed that \\"the 1831 constitution cannot be seen as the product of a 'Belgian' legal tradition\\". Still, Belgium continuously produces and arranges the legal system. The Belgian constitutional law enacted in 1830 mainly presents the fundamental rights of the public. The amendments of the constitutional laws in Belgium are only available by first dissolving the existing Parliament and Senate and electing new members of both houses. Amendments require the assent of two-thirds of the members of Parliament and Senate present at the sitting.  Source of law  Among three major sources of law, which are legislation, customary law and general principles of law, the primary source of law in Belgium is legislation. The two persuasive sources of law which are case-law and academic writing are lesser than the three primary sources of law as Belgium does not provide the system of legal precedents. International law is also a crucial source in Belgium’s legal system, as Belgium is part of various European Union, such as European Convention on Human Right (ECHR), Treaty on European Union, and EU Regulations and Directives. Belgium constitutes a single subject of international law. Thus, the regions and communities in Belgium cooperate when “concluding treaties or representing Belgium in international organizations”. The international law increased power since the constitution of Belgium and involves many provisions which directly influence public lives.  Civil law  Belgium is a federal state with a civil law system. Civil law system in Belgium is inspired by Roman Law and largely influenced by the French legal system particularly by French Civil Code in 1804. This system differentiates with the common law system applied in other countries by making distinction between ‘public’ and ‘private’ law. The public law in Belgium focuses on the cases concerning states, while the private law takes charge of the individual cases among citizens. The Civil code in Belgium is divided into three parts, the first dealing with persons, the second with property, and the third with different modes of acquiring property. The National Registry (Registres d’Etat Civil or Etat Civil) of Belgium has existed since the adoption of the Code Napoleon. The registers were kept in every individual village in Belgium, with the recording of all persons born in the village. The legal process held in the village was also recorded, such as marriage and decease. The National Registry was not only applied to Belgium citizens, but also to the foreigners who stayed in Belgium for at least 2 weeks. The recorded legal documents are only deleted or altered through the order of the Court.  Commercial law  Commercial law in Belgium is a collection of judicial rules governing matters arising out of commercial dealings. Commercial law mainly covers legal cases between transactions on commerce, trade and merchandise. Majority of the commercial legislations are based on code of commerce which is formed under the first Napoleon in 1795. The first legislation on commerce in Belgium was formed when the common law was found to be insufficient to deal with all the ramifications of commercial dealings and local customs. As the necessity of commercial law increase, diverse sets if customs were prepared and put into book form, having commercial law in view. The three principal books are “The Consulate of the Sea”, “The Judgements and Customs of Orleon” and “The Maritime Law of Wisby”.  Napoleonic code  The Napoleonic code (Code Napoléon) is the unified French civil code established by Napoleon in post- revolutionary France, 1804. The base of the codification is formed by Roman law with diverse customs. In the 19th century, the code was influential and fundamental to the world law system. The significant role of Napoleonic code was the replacement of the feudal system of law which was the rest of the French monarchy. The Napoleonic code influenced the development of law systems for countries both throughout and outside Europe. Belgium law codes are adopted from the Napoleonic code.  The Belgium codes  The laws in Belgium are codified. Most of them are based on the civil laws from the code Napoleon, which has been modified to suit the spirit of modern times and customs of the country, and adapted from French. They have been adjusted in accordance with the Belgian laws. Large databases among the codes have more than thousands of laws. There are five major codes, which are Code civil (The Civil Code), Code de commerce (The Commercial Code), Code penal (The Criminal Code), Code d'instruction criminelle (Code of Criminal Procedure) and the Code judiciaire (Judicial Code). Other than the five major codes, a variety of special codes related to military objects, patents, railways, shipping, etc. In Belgium, a jurisprudence administered by the courts exists in order to interpret the law, but no jurisprudence can prevail against an article of the code. A judgement is never quoted before Belgian Court with the object of requiring the Court to state that such judgement should be considered as the law of the land, but it may be quoted simply as a basis for interpreting or explaining a law. Belgium carries out the codification in constant until today.  Courts in Belgium  = Type of courts = Law Courts of Brussels The courts in Belgium are organized in a hierarchy. Belgium is divided into five main judicial areas, which are Brussels, Liège, Ghent, Mons, and Antwerp. These areas are separated to twenty-six judicial districts and further separated to 209 judicial cantons. Among the five judicial areas, Brussels, Liege and Ghent belong to courts of appeal. The highest court is the Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation is the supreme judicial court and the head of all judicial courts in Belgium. It has jurisdiction to overturn judgments and orders which are final in their nature for defect as being contrary to law, and the right to transfer actions and suits from one court to another. The chief courts are The Civil and Criminal Courts and The Commercial Courts. There are also special courts, which are The Assize Court, The Military Court, Workmen’s Court and The Juvenile Court. Other than these courts there are two more courts in Belgium. They are the Conseil d'Etat (Council of State) and the Cour Constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court). Both of these two courts have an obligation to monitor and administer other courts. To be specific, the Council of state is a court which is in charge of monitoring the administration in the courts. The applications from the public concerning the misjudgment of administrative organization are sent to the Council of state for examination. In the Constitutional court, the acts and ordinances of Belgium law are considered. Also, the exercise of power by public authority is supervised by the Constitutional court. = Court structure = The court structure of Belgium follows the French system due to influence of conquest by France. The designation of type of courts for all cases are determined by the severity and size of the offence. When the sort of court with purview has been resolved, the case will be assigned to places to be considered. There is one difference with the court system of France in Belgium, which is usage of language in the court. All the procedures held in the courts in Belgium depend on the location of the court, some use Dutch and some use French. There are also places which use both Dutch and French, typically Brussels.

Founded in October 1998, SongNet has sponsored monthly seminars in which a music industry related guest representative discusses their experience in the industry, and also conducts some songwriting critique of recorded works that attendees have brought with them. In addition to the monthly seminar, SongNet has sponsored a monthly singer-songwriter showcase, in which performers can perform 2 of their musical works for the audience.  History  Linda Geleris. Photo by T. Honles. SongNetThe Songwriter's Network is the brainchild of Los Angeles songwriter Linda Geleris. Geleris felt the isolation experienced by many creative people and in response, sought out other songwriters hoping to build careers in the music business. In the back of her \\"Songwriters Market\\"Songwriter's Market, Ian Bessler, editor, http://www.songwritersmarket.com/ book, she found a listing for the National Academy of Songwriters (NAS), which at the time was meeting at the Hollywood Women's Club. As Linda Geleris tells it, \\"On the occasion of my second visit, I shared some of my M&M;'s with a woman sitting next to me, whose husband had just been tapped to score his first feature film. Four months later, the couple called me up and said that a song was needed for the opening scene. The next day, I 'auditioned' my song in the couples' apartment for the director, producer and music supervisor. It could not have fit the opening scene any better, and the next day the as-yet unrecorded song was recorded and immediately placed into the film. This scenario taught me the importance of networking, being personable and pleasant, and sharing M&M;'s whenever possible.\\" Forming a songwriters network seemed like the next logical step for Geleris. In a network, a group of songwriters could: A) Learn the importance of networking with each other B) Meet guest speakers from many different areas of the music business. C) Encourage one another and share tips and advice At a music seminar, Linda had recently been introduced to a gentleman who co- founded TAXI, an independent A&R; service company. She called him up and pitched her idea for hosting a network with music industry guest speakers, song critiques, and occasional open mics. During the spring and summer of 1999, the ideas evolved and the periodic conversations eventually led to a commitment from Michael Lederer and TAXI to sponsor the endeavor. The first meetings were held at Beantown, a coffee shop in Sierra Madre, California. Pete Luboff was one of the first speakers. In April 2001, Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Honles and Jimi Yamagishi, who had been members since the beginning, joined Linda Geleris as partners to handle the rapid growth of the network. Geleris, Honles, and Yamagishi created a leadership core to expand the range of opportunities available, secure a presence in cyberspace, and to search for new avenues of support for SongNet members.  Current activity  Enlisting the help of promoter Bob Stane, SongNet has found a home at the Coffee Gallery Backstage in Altadena, California. Stane has a legacy in the live entertainment business, most notably, his involvement in establishing The Ice House comedy club in Pasadena, California. In its Altadena location, SongNet meets a short 20-minute drive away from Hollywood and provides a unique meeting venue for the singer-songwriting community that lives east of the area, in Pasadena, in the San Gabriel Valley and further east. Geleris and Yamagishi have extensive contacts in the singer-songwriter community, and Honles has been the webmaster for the organization since 2001. In addition to the partners, volunteers from the singer-songwriter community and the SongNet membership have acted as singer-songwriter showcase coordinators, special event staff, and goodwill spokespersons. In April 2008, the organization has revised its name to reflect its greater involvement in areas outside Los Angeles city proper, adopting simply \\"The Songwriters Network\\" instead of the Los Angeles Songwriter's Network. Membership in the organization exists in two levels, a free \\"basic\\" membership, and a paid membership that supports the SongNet organization financially, and provides the paying member a link on the organization's website, plus a discount at certain other organization's events.

Although commonly performed at university events, few people today know the rarely heard first portion of the song that occurs before the chorus. However, the most common cheer that is used during Pitt-related events and athletic contests is \\"Let's go Pitt!\\", which while perhaps derived from the song's lyrics, is often cheered even in absence of the song or music.The Owl (1962), University of Pittsburgh, pg. 31, accessdate=2009-02-11 Recordings In the early 1950s, the Pitt Band and the Pitt Men's Glee Club cooperated with the RCA Victor recording company to release a compilation of Pitt songs entitled Songs of Pitt During the 1940s Joseph Wood conducted a recording of a collection of songs entitled Songs of the University of Pittsburgh that featured Walter Scheff, Ralph Nyland, and Michael Stewart.

This reinforces the attention on, and popularity of, the university's football team at the time of its writing. The Pitt Band plays the \\"Victory Song\\" at the end of a 26-13 win over Notre Dame at Pitt Stadium during the 1956 Pitt football season Some printings of the lyrics record the version \\"It may be tough, The going rough, But always fighting fair\\" - which reverses the order of the words \\"rough\\" and \\"tough\\" =Controversy with unofficial lyrics= For most of the history of Pittsburgh Panthers athletic programs, a major rivalry has been with the Penn State Nittany Lions, especially in football. During the 1970s and 1980s, the rivalry was especially intense, with the two schools' football teams often competing for the national championship along with state supremacy. During this period, words to the final portion of the song containing the bridge were substituted by students. The popularity of the use of these alternative lyrics carried over to when the fight song was used even during contests when Penn State was not the opponent, including other sporting events such as basketball. However some administrators at the university, including athletic director Steve Pederson, thought that the language was undignified, especially in light of the fact that many of the athletic contests where the chant could be heard were broadcast on regional and national television. Beginning with the 2001–2002 school year, the university administration, without announcement, mandated the Pitt Band to stop playing the portion of the song with the objectionable student-substituted lyrics. The elimination of the verse was intended to clean up the sportsmanship of the song, especially in light of controversial suspension of the football series, and to center cheers strictly on Pitt, but it was not met without controversy. Letters to the editor - Opinions The altered version without the final bridge remains the version played by the Pitt Band to this day. However, the bridge was still played as part of the Victory Chorale until 2015 where it was removed completely.Pitt Victory Song - New Student Guide A 1938 printing of a song book containing college songs shows a slight variation in verse from \\"So lend a hand,...\\" that is described above to \\"So give a hand,...\\" See also * \\"Hail to Pitt\\" * University of Pittsburgh Alma Mater * Pitt Band * Pitt Athletics * Pitt football * Pitt basketball * University of Pittsburgh References External links * MP3 of the \\"Pitt Victory Song\\" * Pitt Band University of Pittsburgh American college songs College fight songs in the United States Atlantic Coast Conference fight songs ","title":"Pitt Victory Song"},{"id":"16066818","text":"Betsako is a town and commune () in Madagascar.

The institute comprises a graduate education centre with a 2-year master of arts program, an elementary school for children from nursery to 6th grade, and a multidisciplinary research centre in child development. History In 1925 Professor Edward Alexander Bott established the St. George’s School for Child Study at the University of Toronto, which would eventually come to be known as The Institute for Child Study. A number of factors contributed to the school's beginnings: the efforts of the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene of which Bott was a prominent member, the emergence of psychology as a discipline distinct from philosophy at the University of Toronto, the philanthropic activities of the Rockefeller Foundation, and the evolution of the Child Study movement in North America . In 1924, with project grants awarded by the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation and the Canadian National Mental Hygiene Committee, Bott set up an interdisciplinary project administration board. He hired Dr. William E. Blatz, who was then responsible for directing projects for the board, which included setting up a major longitudinal study of some 1400 elementary school children to study specific areas of their social adjustment,Raymond, 1991, p.87 designing and implementing a laboratory nursery school, and developing a parental education program. While the large scale study was carried out at the Regal Road Public School, the nursery school and the parent education program were to become the two major divisions of the St. George’s School. By 1937, the funding of the Rockefeller Foundation covered only about half of the school’s expenses, and a special committee was appointed by the university governors to consider the future of St. George’s. The decision was to make child study a faculty unto itself, which would keep it under the wing of the University of Toronto, but invite outside financing. In 1937, St. George's School for Child Study, including the research and graduate education activities, was renamed the Institute of Child Study.Raymond, 1991, p.143. In 2010, the institute was named in honour of Dr. Eric Jackman, a clinical psychologist and alumnus of the laboratory school whose financial gift was the largest donation to early childhood education in Canadian history.Kate Hammer. \\"U of T’s Institute for Child Study receives $5-million donation to expand facilities\\". The Globe and Mail, Dec. 2, 2010. Master of Arts Program The 2-year MA in Child Study and Education, first offered in 1997, is offered to students holding a four-year bachelor's degree in any discipline. It combines elementary teacher education with graduate studies. Students in the MA program carryout practicum teaching assignments at the ICS Laboratory School, as well as in public school settings. The program offers students a thesis option—Qualifying Research Paper—generally undertaken by students who plan to pursue doctoral work. Research Centre Endowed in 1992, the Dr. R.G.N. Laidlaw Research Centre is aimed at understanding children and innovative programs to support their education and development. An overarching theme for investigation is how to promote the movement of research into practice, or in some cases, how research emerges from practice through action research. Some areas of interest are concerned with elementary education, including literacy, numeracy, and science, with supports for understanding how new technologies may contribute to children’s learning and how knowledge building communities are formed. Another focal point of research is concerned with early childhood development and community-school relationships that support children and families.Microsoft Word - LAIDLAW REPORT FINAL.doc Research at the centre benefits from collaboration among faculty, graduate students, and the ICS Laboratory School teacher-researchers, and by links to partner schools.

It is located 53 km southeast of Ravahere, its closest neighbor, and 100 km southwest of Hao Atoll. Nengonengo Atoll is roughly bell-shaped. It measures 13 km in length with a maximum width of 8 km. It has a wide lagoon with a surface 67 km². There is a narrow pass to enter the lagoon on the north side, but no charted data appears to be available. In August 1952, W.I.B. Crealock, in the Brixham Trawler Arthur Rogers, captained by Tom Hepworth, reported a pass into the lagoon. Hepworth attempted entrance but was temporarily hung up in the shallow pass requiring use of a winch to gain entry into the lagoon. William Ion Belton Crealock was a sailor, sailing navigator, yacht designer, and author. He was one of the world's leading yacht designers from the 1960s through the 1990s. Once anchored in the lagoon, Hepworth took soundings in the pass. As reported by Crealock (1955:205-207): \\"For the next three days we surveyed the pass from the dingy, working during the few hours of slack water; we had learned by now that in normal weather the current in these lagoons will slacken off towards high and low water, and that there might even be a slight in-going current for an hour or so. Three of us were needed for these sounding operations, one to row the dingy, one to work the lead line, and the third to see, from underwater, that the lead missed no irregularties in the bottom. We were working not in feet but with inches. The bed of the pass, we discovered, was smoothed by the current, with coral growths no larger than cabbages on gently undulating slopes.\\" Tom Hepworth discovered that there was no straight path through the pass with more than 6 feet of water.in the Admiralty Pilot available in 1952, depth of the pass was reported at 6 fathoms instead of 6 feet, with the pass reported on the eastern rather than northern side of the reef. There is a non-navigable pass on the eastern side. Hepworth anchored adjacent to the beach in the northwest corner of the lagoon. The Aurther Rogers possessed an 8-foot draft, and to close the gap between pass depth and boat draft, they waited 10 days for spring tides, which increased pass depth, and then altered the trim of the boat. They eventually found a channel through the pass carrying 7.5 feet, and were able to escape the lagoon. Nengonengo has a very small population, and is actually occupied exclusively by the pearl farms belonging to Mr. R. Wan. History The first recorded European who arrived to Nengonengo was Englishman Samuel Wallis in 1767. He named it \\"Prince William Henry\\".

All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right. The Israeli healthcare system is based on the National Health Insurance Law of 1995, which mandates all citizens resident in the country to join one of four official health insurance organizations, known as Kupat Holim (קופת חולים - \\"Sick Funds\\") which are run as not-for-profit organizations and are prohibited by law from denying any Israeli resident membership. Israelis can increase their medical coverage and improve their options by purchasing private health insurance. In a survey of 48 countries in 2013, Israel's health system was ranked fourth in the world in terms of efficiency, and in 2014 it ranked seventh out of 51. In 2015, Israel was ranked sixth-healthiest country in the world by Bloomberg rankings and ranked eighth in terms of life expectancy. History Pharmacy in Petah Tikva, 1930s Hadassah nursing students, 1948 Magen David Adom ambulance, 1948 =Ottoman era= During the Ottoman era, health care in the region of Palestine was poor and underdeveloped. Most medical institutions were run by Christian missionaries, who attracted the indigent by offering free care. In the late nineteenth century, as the Yishuv, the pre-state Jewish community, began to grow in the wake of the First Aliyah, the Jews attempted to establish their own medical system. In 1872, Max Sandreczky, a German Christian physician, settled in Jerusalem and opened the first children's hospital in the country, Marienstift, which admitted children of all faiths. The Jewish agricultural settlements, financially backed by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, hired a physician who traveled between the communities and ran a pharmacy in Jaffa which he visited twice a week. In 1902, the first Jewish hospital, Shaarei Zedek, opened in the Old City of Jerusalem. Additional Jewish hospitals were built in Jerusalem and Jaffa. In 1911, the Judea Worker's Health Fund, which later evolved into Clalit Health Services, was established as the first Zionist health insurance fund in the country. During World War I, the Ottoman authorities closed the Jewish hospitals in Jerusalem and Jaffa. The Ottoman Army seized the medical equipment and drafted most of the doctors. With the war's end and the British conquest of Palestine, the Yishuv was left without an effective hospital system. In 1918, the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America established the American Zionist Medical Unit (AZMU) to rebuild the Yishuv's medical system. With assistance from the AZMU and foreign contributions, the Jewish hospitals were reopened, and a new one was established in Jaffa. In 1919, hospitals were opened in Safed and Tiberias, and a hospital was opened in Haifa in 1922. The AZMU was turned into the Hadassah Medical Federation, which oversaw the Yishuv's health system.Shvarts, Shifra: The Workers' Health Fund in Eretz Israel: Kupat Holim, 1911–1937 =British Mandate = With the start of British rule, measures were taken to improve public health in the area. They began during British military rule, and continued to grow with the establishment of the British Mandate in 1922. In Jerusalem, accumulated refuse heaps were removed, public rubbish bins were installed; the entire population was vaccinated against smallpox, and pools and cisterns were covered with mosquito repellent as part of the campaign to eradicate malaria. In 1929, the Zionist Commission and the British authorities sent the Jewish epidemiologist Gideon Mer to Rosh Pinna to establish a laboratory for malaria research. Mer's laboratory was instrumental in eradicating the disease. The campaign against malaria was headed by Hadassah until 1927, when the organization turned responsibility over to the authorities. The Mandate administration also operated a Health Department that operated its own hospitals, clinics, and laboratories. The Health Department primarily cared for British personnel stationed in Israel and provided health services to the Arab population. Little was invested in Jewish health, as it was assumed that the Yishuv was capable of managing its own healthcare system. With the expansion of the Yishuv through the Third and Fourth Aliyah, the number of new Jewish medical facilities grew. The number of Hadassah hospital beds tripled. New Jewish hospitals and health insurance funds were also established. The other major provider of healthcare aside from Hadassah was the Histadrut labor federation, which established its own sick fund, Kupat Holim Clalit, and by 1946 operated two hospitals and hundreds of clinics and health centers. In addition, some private medical centers and health funds were also established. The Yishuv's health insurance and medical services organizations, known as Kupat Holim (pl. Kupot Holim) were modeled after the medical mutual-aid societies that were formed in Germany following Otto von Bismarck's social legislation of the late 19th century. The term Kupat Holim is a literal Hebrew translation of the German word Krankenkasse. Although they have undergone significant reform since, to this day they are an integral part of Israel's universal healthcare system (as they are in present-day German- speaking countries). =State of Israel= The Yishuv's health system formed the basis of the Israeli healthcare system with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The Israeli government replaced the British Mandate's health department with a Ministry of Health, and established regional health bureaus and an epidemiological service. Hospital facilities formerly run by the British authorities were taken over by the state, and new hospitals and clinics were established. At the end of 1948, only 53% of Israel's Jewish population was insured, about 80% of them by Clalit, with a few small health funds insuring the remainder. Throughout the following years, Israel's healthcare system was expanded, and within a decade, about 90% were insured. Beit Habriyut Straus, Jerusalem, built in 1927 In 1973, a law was enacted which forced all employers to participate in the medical insurance of their workers, by means of a direct payment to their workers' insurance plans. The duty of participation was eventually changed and diminished in 1991. Until the enactment of the National Health Insurance Law in 1995, the Israeli healthcare system was based on voluntary membership of Israeli citizens in one of four independently operating Sick Funds, known as Kupot Holim, which were responsible for providing medical care to their members. The largest Kupat Holim was Clalit Health Services, which was owned by the Histadrut labor federation. There were initially six other Kupot Holim, though the number was reduced to four in the 1970s after two of them merged. There were a number of government-owned hospitals, with 29 hospitals operated by the government in 1987. Clalit owned several hospitals, as well as clinics in virtually every city, town, village, and kibbutz. There were other organizations which maintained some of their own medical facilities and funded the hospitalization of their clients in government hospitals. For health insurance, people had to pay premiums which varied according to income. The government also subsidized the health funds. Finally, there were some private doctors and very few private hospitals, and some highly expensive health plans covered private healthcare. The level of health coverage provided varied among Kupot Holim. Furthermore, Clalit was the only one not to restrict entry to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions, or other factors, although membership in the Histadrut labor union was a pre-condition for membership with Clalit. This meant that people who did not (or could not) have such an affiliation with the Histadrut and were unable to join another sick fund lacked health insurance coverage. Nevertheless, by the early 1990s approximately 95% of the population was insured by the four funds. In 1988 the government appointed a National Commission of Inquiry to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Israeli health care system, headed by Shoshana Netanyahu. The commission handed in the final report in 1990. The main recommendation of this report was to enact a National Health Insurance law which would streamline the management, delivery and public financing of medical services in the country and guarantee a minimum health coverage level to all citizens. The recommendation was promoted by Health Minister Haim Ramon and the National Health Insurance Law was passed by the Knesset in 1994 and came into effect on January 1, 1995. After enactment of the 1995 law, membership in one of the four Kupot Holim became mandatory while acceptance into any of them was legally guaranteed, Clalit's linkage with the Histadrut was severed, and Israeli residents became entitled to the same minimum basic basket of services regardless of which fund they belonged to, and were permitted to switch between funds once a year. In the late 2000s, a future shortage of doctors and nurses became a concern, as the rate of doctors graduating from Israel's medical schools annually had dropped to 300, 200 less than needed, and many Soviet immigrant doctors and nurses began to retire. That number was estimated to eventually rise to 520 with the opening of a fifth medical school, but still below the 900 graduates that will be needed in 2022. This caused concerns of a shortage of medical personnel, which would imperil the quality and speed of medical care in the country. As a result, Israel began offering incentives to Jewish doctors to emigrate from abroad and practice medicine in Israel. Initially, only about 100 doctors from the former Soviet Union immigrated under this program every year, but the program is now attracting doctors from North America and Western Europe. An investigative committee looking into the issue also called for incentives to be offered to Israeli medical students who had not been accepted in Israel and had gone to study medicine abroad to return to Israel, and for a program that involves 150 international students studying medicine in Israel to be shut down. In addition, the Israeli Health Ministry announced the launching of a new nursing assistants' profession, and increased nursing education programs in colleges. Israel has also begun a program under which doctors from Eastern Europe work in Israel in fields such as pediatrics and internal medicine. Health insurance framework =National Health Insurance Law= Health care spending in Israel as a percentage of GDP Under the National Health Insurance Law, membership in one of the four following health funds, or Kupot Holim (Patient Funds) is compulsory for all residents of Israel: Clalit, Maccabi, Meuhedet and Leumit. Clalit is the largest of the four, with about half of the population belonging to it. The four Kupot Holim are obligated to provide a uniform list of health services, known as the \\"Health Basket\\" (סל בריאות; Sal Briut ), for all members - a list of medical services and treatments which each Kupat Holim is required to fund for its members. The law established a system of direct oversight of the Kupot Holim by the state, and certain services are under the direct administration of the State, usually by means of the Health Ministry. The Health Basket covers all costs of medical diagnosis and treatment in the areas of family medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), preventive medicine, surgery (including elective surgery), transplants, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, first aid and transportation to a medical facility, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medications approved under the National Health Basket (which is updated every year), treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and mental healthcare. Medications for serious illnesses that are part of the official \\"basket of medications\\" formulary (which is large and updated regularly, but does not include all medications) are covered, though patients must partially pay for these medications with copays: medications included in the basket are covered at rates that vary from 50% to 90%. IVF treatments for the first two children up to the age of 45 and abortions are also covered. A committee appointed by the health ministry reviews the contents of the health basket on a yearly basis and determines which new treatments will be added to it within the constraints of the annual budget allocated to the basket by the government. In general, each Kupat Holim allows members to choose a primary care physician and specialists from a list of doctors associated with the fund. Availability of services differs by location, as each of these organizations operate their own medical facilities, including private hospitals. While the Kupot Holim typically cover medical treatment in Israel, they can fund medical procedures abroad when the procedure in question cannot be obtained in Israel. There is a cap of $250,000 without copay to fund treatment abroad, though that limit can be waived by the Director-General of the Health Ministry.http://www.health.gov.il/English/Topics/RightsInsured/RightsUnderLaw/ServicesAbroad/Pages/default.aspx Members of each Kupat Holim can switch to another once a year. There are six specified dates on which people can transfer, depending on when they signed up for their previous one. In special circumstances, it is possible to petition the Ministry of Health to cancel a change or register earlier than an official date. The National Health Insurance Law sets out a system of public funding for health services by means of a progressive health tax, administered by Bituah Leumi, or the National Insurance Institute, Israel's social security organization, which transfers funding to the Kupot Holim according to a capitation formula based on the number of members in each fund, the age distribution of members, and a number of other indices. The Kupot Holim also receive some direct government funding. The government provides the Kupot Holim relatively wide leeway in determining how to spend this funding, with the condition that the Kupot Holim must guarantee providing the treatments set forth in the health basket as a minimum service to their members. For the health tax, wage-earners and the self-employed must pay 3.1% of their monthly salary up to 60% of the average prevailing market wage (appx. NIS 6,300 in 2020), and 5% of anything earned above it. Employers are legally obligated to deduct insurance contributions from their employees' salaries, while the self- employed must arrange payment on their own. Pensioners have contributions deducted from their pensions, as do those receiving unemployment benefits. Those who are not working but have income must pay 5% of their income in health tax, while those who are not working and have no income must pay NIS 104 a month. Only a select few categories of people are exempt from paying health premiums. Dependent minors are exempt. Housewives who do not work are exempt unless they receive a pension or their spouse receives an increment to a pension. In addition, people who immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return, and Israeli citizens who were born abroad or left as minors, and who settle in Israel are entitled to one year of free health insurance if they are not working, subject to some exceptions. While the vast majority of public health services are covered by the Kupot Holim under the National Health Insurance Law, pre-natal, post-natal, and geriatric care services are run directly by the Ministry of Health.adva.org (Note: Mental health services were run by the Health Ministry at the time of this article's publication, hence them being mentioned as a service run by that miniatry, but responsibility has since shifted to the Kupot Holim) Government spending on healthcare is about 60% of the total, considerably below the average for OECD countries of 72%. Although most residents are covered under the National Health Insurance Law, some exceptions apply to people who receive state-funded healthcare through other means. All soldiers except those who were found medically unfit for service but volunteered are not covered by their Kupat Holim during their military service, but receive healthcare through the military healthcare system. Upon leaving the military, soldiers rejoin their previous Kupat Holim. Disabled veterans are covered by the Ministry of Defense. In addition, some disabled World War II veterans and victims of the Nazis are eligible for certain types of health benefits from the Ministry of Finance. New immigrants who have not yet registered with a Kupat Holim and are in immediate need of healthcare can apply for coverage from the Public Ombudsman of the Ministry of Health.

Supplemental coverage The four health funds offer their members the option of purchasing supplemental insurance plans which provide coverage for services not included in the basket of services or provide coverage at an increased level. These supplemental plans are usually offered in two or three coverage tiers and include or provide discounts on services and products such as: second opinions from medical specialists, surgeries and other medical procedures by private physicians and in private or semi-private facilities in Israel and abroad, dental and orthodontic coverage for adults, discounts on drugs not included in the public \\"basket of medications\\", expanded maternity care, additional vaccinations and medical tests, alternative medicine, and more. The cost of these supplemental plans is relatively modest (costing an equivalent of US$10 to $35 per month for an adult depending on age group and coverage tier in 2019). The health funds are prohibited by law from denying any member participation in a supplementary health insurance plan, and may not charge different premiums due to pre-existing conditions, although they usually impose an initial waiting period before supplemental coverage takes effect. Supplemental plans are heavily promoted by the health funds and as of 2017 more than three quarters of all Israelis subscribe to them. Private insurance coverage There are private health insurance plans which citizens may participate in addition to the compulsory participation in one of four national health funds. All major Israeli commercial insurance companies offer health insurance plans. These plans provide coverage for additional options for treatments. For example, in the area of elective surgery, a participant in a private insurance plan may choose the surgeon, anesthetist, and hospital anywhere in Israel or around the world. In the area of transplants, unlimited funding is available to ensure a donor is found and the procedure is done without the need for government approval. In the area of medications for serious illnesses, private insurance companies give access to a wider range of than the official \\"basket of medications\\", as the Israeli government is not financially capable of covering all medications. In comparison with health insurance in other countries, private health insurance in Israel is considered comparatively inexpensive, but premiums are based on age, gender, and unlike the supplemental coverage offered by the health funds also depend on pre- existing conditions and previous medical history. As of 2017, approximately one third of Israelis purchase some level of private health insurance coverage. Frequently this coverage at least partially overlaps with the supplemental coverage offered by the health funds, meaning that some subscribers pay twice for the same coverage (and which is usually less expensive when obtained through the health funds' supplemental plans). This has prompted calls for the Israeli insurance commissioner to impose tighter regulations on the private health insurance marketplace. Some insurance companies offer private health insurance coverage specifically designed to supplement the supplemental plans offered by the health funds to avoid the double-coverage situation. Healthcare providers and facilities Providers in the Israeli healthcare system consist of a mixture of private, semi-private and public entities. Generally, family and primary medicine facilities are run directly by Clalit for its members while the other Kupot Holim operate their own family practice clinics in the larger cities and contract with privately operated family practice clinics in smaller communities. As with primary practice, Clalit tends to provide specialty and outpatient care in their own clinics while the other health funds generally contract with outside, private care physicians and facilities for this sort of service. In addition to these, the ministry of health in conjunction with various local authorities also runs a network of public well care and prenatal and infant care clinics throughout the country. =Private healthcare facilities= There are private hospitals and clinics throughout the country. Although the healthcare in public and private hospitals is equivalent in quality, private hospitals offer superior patient care and amenities to public hospitals, such as private rooms designed as hotel rooms, Internet and television access, restaurant-quality food, and extra beds for visitors to stay overnight. Safety and quality Israel has one of the most technologically advanced and highest-quality healthcare systems in the world. Hospitals in Israel are equipped with modern facilities and high-quality medical technology. Medical personnel are very well-trained. Healthcare in Israel is also delivered very efficiently. A 2013 found Israel to have the fourth most efficient healthcare system in the world. In an August 2014 survey, Israel was ranked as having the seventh-most efficient healthcare system in the world. Seven Israeli hospitals have received accreditation from the Joint Commission, an organization that sets safety standards for medical care: Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, HaEmek Medical Center in Afula, Meir Hospital in Kfar Saba, Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot, Carmel Medical Center in Haifa and Assuta Medical Center in Tel Aviv. In 2019 and 2020, Newsweek magazine included Israel's largest hospital, Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer in its list of the ten best hospitals in the world. Physicians Typical Magen David Adom ambulance In 2013 there were 3.1 professionally active physicians per 1000 population in Israel, a ratio higher than countries like the U.S. and Japan. At the end of 2014, there where 34,231 registered physicians in Israel, 25,637 under the age of 65, 30,683 under the age of 75. There are over 10,000 more physicians in Israel who are licensed but not practicing (working in other fields, retired). About forty percent of Israeli physicians are women. Between 2000 and 2009 the OECD reports no growth in the physician per capita ratio in Israel compared to a global average of 1.7% growth in developed countries. There are also severe physician shortages in specific specialties, such as anesthesia, general surgery, geriatrics, and primary care Afek, A., Toker, A., Berlovitz, Y., & Shamiss, A. (2011). Hitmodidut im hamakhsor birofim biYisrael Coping with the physician shortage in Israel. Harefuah, 150, 212-215 Israel has five university medical schools which typically follow the European 6-year training model. However, the medical school at Bar-Ilan University follows a four-year program similar to the American system. Tel Aviv University also offers a four-year program similar to the American system for students who hold a bachelor's degree in certain biological sciences. The entrance requirements for the various schools of medicine are strict: all students must have a high school matriculation certificate with a grade average above 100 and a psychometric grade over 740. In 2008, only 35% of doctors in Israel were born there, and almost 50% were immigrants, especially from Argentina and Eastern Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union. In addition, many Israelis study medicine abroad, with Israeli medical students particularly popular with European universities. To practice in Israel, doctors trained abroad must pass a licensing examination to ensure that their medical training is up to Israeli standards. Immigrant doctors who graduated from an American, British, Canadian, French, Australian, New Zealand, or South African medical school are exempt, provided they have 14 years of experience, including residency, and undergo a six-month internship-like \\"adjustment period\\" in Israel. Nurses As of 2011, there were 37,300 actively practicing nurses in Israel or 4.81 nurses per 1000 population compared to OECD country average of 8.7 nurses per 1000 population, ranking Israel one of the lowest nursing ratio countries in the developed world, after Greece, Mexico, and Turkey. This represents a 14% decrease in Israeli nursing per capita from 2001. Nursing education is similar to that of other developed countries. There are many Registered Nurse programs, Bachelor of nursing academic programs, and several graduate schools for advanced degrees. A Bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for advanced certifications and clinical courses.http://www.old.health.gov.il/Download/pages/tnaiim040511.pdf Licensed practical nurse programs ended, yet were recently re-approved as a solution to the nursing shortage in Israel. Although nurse practitioners were legalized in Israel in November 2013, only Israeli-trained nurse practitioners are authorized to work. Although the law provides for recognition of foreign- trained nurse practitioners, no process is in place for doing so. Only geriatric, palliative and neonatal nurse practitioners have been allowed to work thus far, although plans for other NP specialties are in place. All NP courses to date have been provided by the Ministry of Health, and are post- Masters certificate courses several months in length. Compared to Western country standards and the International Council of Nursing, Israeli nurse practitioners have relatively limited scopes of practice and independence.  Physician assistants  One of the well-established solutions to the growing shortage of medical personnel that is experienced also in Israel is the development of mid-level practitioners, e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The development of Physician Assistants in Israel was in a constant debate for years until a committee appointed by the Ministry of Health Director General recommended on 2013 on the development of an Israeli version of Physician Assistants in five areas that are currently in great need: Internal Medicine, Surgery, Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine and Pathology. Because of legislative reasons, and in order to implement fast, the Ministry of Health decided not to create a new general profession like in the US but to expand the capabilities and authorities of existing medical professions thus creating new 'roles' for these professions as Physician Assistants. The first course of Emergency Medicine Physician Assistants started on May 15, 2016, comprising about 35 participants, most of them academic paramedic with substantial experience and very few MDs from international universities (outside Israel) that failed to pass the Israeli government examination so are not licensed to practice medicine in Israel. In the near future the Israeli Ministry of Health intends to open similar courses in the areas of Anesthesiology and Pathology.  Emergency services  Magen David Adom armored mobile intensive care unit Emergency medical services in Israel are provided by the Magen David Adom (MDA) organization, which staffs approximately 1,200 emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and emergency physicians, and 10,000 volunteers. The organizations operates 95 stations and a fleet of over 700 ambulances. The majority of the fleet consists of basic life support ambulances. There are also smaller numbers of advanced life support ambulances and mobile intensive care units. For air ambulance services, MDA relies primarily on Unit 669 of the Israeli Air Force. There are also four MBB Bo 105 utility helicopters staffed with MDA paramedics owned by Lahak Aviation operating as air ambulances throughout the country. Non- emergency and repatriation air ambulance services are normally provided by private charter carriers. Magen David Adom is supplemented in some areas by Hatzalah, an emergency ambulance services network serving Jewish communities worldwide, and ZAKA, a series of community emergency response teams staffed by Orthodox Jews, who in addition to providing medical services and evacuation, also aid in the identification of terrorism victims and gather spilled blood and body parts for burial. The Palestine Red Crescent Society also provides services to Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem. It gained access to Jerusalem after signing a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding with Magen David Adom. The ambulance system, for the most part, conforms to the Franco-German model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies is not uncommon. In addition, emergency ambulance services is bolstered by a variety of private carriers tasked with interfacility transfers only. Medical tourism Clalit clinic in the Bedouin Arab village of Tuba-ZangariyyeGaza residents being transferred for medical treatment in Israel through Erez Crossing Israel is emerging as a popular destination for medical tourists. In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. As of 2010, up to 30,000 foreigners come to Israel every year for treatment, mostly from Russia. Some medical tourists come to Israel because the procedures they seek are not available in their home countries. Others, particularly from the US, choose Israel because they can receive high quality treatment, such as surgery and in-vitro fertilization at much lower cost. Many medical tourists come to Israel for treatment at the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort. The Israel Ministry of Tourism and professional medical services providers are working to promote awareness of this niche in Israel. According to a report in 2013, the number of patients from Eastern Europe, Cyprus and the United States seeking treatment at Israel's public and private hospitals is growing. Income from medical tourism was assessed at about $140 million in 2012. =Palestinian medical tourism= A significant number of residents of the Palestinian territories seek medical treatment in Israel, often for sophisticated tests or treatments not available at Palestinian hospitals. Their treatment is paid for under a financial arrangement with the Palestinian Authority, or in some cases, at their own expense. Medical treatment for Gaza Strip residents is paid for by the Palestinian Authority or organizations such as the Peres Center for Peace. Palestinians who apply for medical treatment in Israel must obtain a humanitarian entry permit from Israel, of which thousands are issued annually. In January 2009, during the Gaza War, the Palestinian Authority temporarily canceled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for the chronically ill and those in need of complex care not available in the Palestinian territories. Palestinian officials stated that they wished to send the patients to neighboring Arab countries instead, accusing Israeli officials of using Palestinian patients, some injured in Israeli airstrikes, in PR campaigns to improve Israel's tarnished image during the Gaza War. In 2012, The Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Health reported spending approximately $42 million in 2011 to finance medical coverage of Palestinians in Israeli hospitals and the Arab World. Arab citizens of Israel belong to the same health care system as that of all other citizens of the country. Gaza Strip resident giving birth to quadruplets at an Israeli hospital, 2008 The quality of medical care in Israel is significantly better than anywhere in the West Bank and Gaza. Irwin Mansdorf, a member of Task Force on Medical and Public Health Issues, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East wrote about routine care that Palestinians continue to receive in Israeli hospitals and from Israeli physicians.BMJ journal Derek Summerfield article in reply to Simon Fellerman Saving Children, established by the Peres Peace Center, enables hundreds of Palestinian children to receive free medical care, in particular cardiac surgery, from Israeli surgeons. \\"Save a Child's Heart\\" is a program in which any child with heart problems can receive free medical attention and surgery from select doctors and hospitals within Israel. From 1996 to 2007, 4,591 children had been examined worldwide, of the 1848 children treated 828 (45%) were Palestinian.Save a Child's Heart.com Success rates =Humanitarian aid= As of August 2013, Israeli hospitals have provided treatment to scores of Syrian citizens injured in the Syrian civil war. Since late March, some 100 Syrians have been treated at two hospitals in Galilee. The patients arrive by military ambulance and the hospital calls the army to transport them back when they are released. The Israeli military also operates a field hospital and mobile medical teams along the Syrian frontier. =Uninsured populations= One of the great achievements of the National Health Insurance Law in 1995 was that practically all the Israeli population was insured and thus entitled to the services included in the 'health basket'. Nevertheless, as of 2016, there are roughly 250,000 non-tourists that stay in Israel for long periods that are not entitled to the benefits of the National Health Insurance Law. About 100,000 of them are foreign workers who entered Israel legally and have a mandatory private health insurance that is paid by their employer. Another 100,000 are people who entered Israel legally (as tourists or as foreign workers) but became illegal residents after overstaying their visas. The remaining 50,000 are work immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, mainly from Eritrea and Sudan, who entered Israel illegally through the Egyptian border (prior to the construction of the Egypt–Israel barrier).Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel For those illegal residents that are working full-time, there is a mandatory health insurance by the employer. This insurance is limited as it is dependent on the continued work and payments subtracted from salary, thus becoming ineffective and practically expires as the insured becomes unemployed from health reasons. For those 'illegal residents' that don't have effective health insurance and are protected from deportation to their countries of origin (because of the ongoing conflicts or forced recruitment), a few services were developed either by the Israel Ministry of Health or by local NGOs and international aid organizations. The most important services include free access to Emergency Rooms and hospitalization services when needed for urgent care, primary care clinics,Physicians for Human Rights–Israel and a psychiatric clinic. There is a Public Health Clinic in Tel Aviv jointly run by the Terem organization and the Israeli Health Ministry which provides emergency care, specialist services in a number of fields, and dental care to people who do not qualify for coverage under the National Health Insurance Law and have no other source of coverage, aside from tourists. Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers make up a large part of its client base. Medical facilities In the end of 2014, there were 85 hospitals in Israel: 44 general hospitals, 12 mental health hospitals, 29 specialized hospitals (geriatric and rehabilitation centers), as well as 278 residential long-term facilities. Only 11 of the general hospitals are government-owned and operated by the Ministry of Health, 9 owned by Clalit, and the rest are private, such as Herzliya Medical Center. Most of the private hospitals in Israel belong to nonprofit or charitable organizations. Public clinics and pharmacies, along with other medical facilities, are operated by the four Kupot Holim, each of which operates its own chain. Clalit has the largest network of medical facilities, with about 1,400 clinics and 420 pharmacies. Leumit operates 320 clinics and 150 pharmacies. Maccabi operates 150 clinics, 43 pharmacies, and 20 diagnostic and therapeutic centers. Meuhedet operates 250 clinics and 40 pharmacies.http://lang.meuhedet.co.il/ In addition, there are hundreds of private clinics and pharmacies, some of which contract with the Kupot Holim to provide services to their members. Public satisfaction with hospital care is considerably less than with other aspects of the healthcare system. There are 3.1 beds per 1000 population, compared with an OECD average of 4.8. Occupancy runs at 96%. The average length of stay is 4.3 days, compared with the OECD average of 6.5. There are long waiting lists which has led more than 75% of the population to take out secondary health insurance. Medical research Israel is a world leader in medical and paramedical research, and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, medical, and clinical research account for over half of Israel's scientific publications, and the industrial sector uses this extensive knowledge to develop new pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and treatment therapies. Among other areas of medicine, Israel is a leader in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita, as well as research into regenerative medicine and medical marijuana.

Early life Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II and her daughters, Gladys and Gertrude, having tea in the library at the Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. (William Bruce Ellis Ranken, 1932) Alice Claypoole Gwynne was born on November 11, 1845 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Alice, who was also raised in Cincinnati, was a daughter of Rachel Moore (née Flagg) and lawyer Abraham Evan Gwynne. After her father's death in 1855, her mother remarried to Albert Mathews, who wrote under the name Paul Siogvolk. Alice's siblings included David Eli Gwynne, Abram Evan Gwynne, Cettie Moore (née Gwynne) Shepherd, and Edith Olivia (née Gwynne) Gill. She was a granddaughter of Henry Collins Flagg, a former mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, and a great-great granddaughter of Major Ebenezer Flagg, who served in the 1st Rhode Island Regiment during the American Revolution, and who was killed in action in 1781. Her maternal uncles were George Whiting Flagg, a painter, and Jared Bradley Flagg, also a painter and real estate developer. Through Jared Flagg, she was a first cousin of Ernest Flagg, an American architect. Alice was from an old Rhode Island family and among her ancestors was Roger Williams, who founded the State of Rhode Island, and Samuel Ward Sr., a former Rhode Island Governor. Many Flagg family members are buried in Newport's Island Cemetery. Alice's affection for Newport reflected this association of her earliest colonial ancestors with the city. Married life Gertrude in 1895. While teaching Sunday school at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New York, she met Cornelius Vanderbilt II, the eldest son of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa Kissam. They were married on February 4, 1867 at the Church of the Incarnation on Madison Avenue in New York. Together, Alice and Cornelius were the parents of four sons and three daughters: * Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt (1869–1874), who died young. * William Henry \\"Bill\\" Vanderbilt II (1870–1892), who died of typhoid fever while a student at Yale University. * Cornelius \\"Neily\\" Vanderbilt III (1873–1942), who was disinherited for marrying Grace Graham Wilson against his parents' wishes. * Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942), who married Harry Payne Whitney. Gertrude was an artist who founded the Whitney Museum. * Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (1877–1915), who died aboard the RMS Lusitania. * Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt (1880–1925) * Gladys Moore Vanderbilt (1886–1965), who married Count László Széchenyi. Alice Vanderbilt's husband died of a cerebral hemorrhage on September 12, 1899 at their New York home at 1 West 57th Street. His estate at the time of his death was appraised at $72,999,867 (equivalent to $ in dollars), $20 million of which was real estate. Alice lived another 35 years until her death on April 22, 1934 at her home at 1 East 67th Street in Manhattan, where she had moved after the sale of the 57th Street mansion in 1925 (it was demolished in 1926). Her youngest daughter, Countess Széchenyi, inherited both the massive summer \\"cottage\\" The Breakers, in Newport, and her mother's last New York townhouse, the former residence of George Jay Gould Sr. Gertrude received the proceeds from the sale of 1 West 57th Street, totaling $7,000,000. =Real estate= Vanderbilt's Newport cottage, The Breakers, built in 1893 by Richard Morris Hunt. Alice was responsible for constructing several massive family houses, including the enlargement of 1 West 57th Street, making it the largest private residence to ever be built in an American city at the time. She also played a role in constructing The Breakers, in Newport. In 1914, she was responsible for the construction of the Gwynne Building in Cincinnati, Ohio, site of the first shop of Procter & Gamble, later the company's headquarters. After her death, her son Neily received ownership of the Gwynne Building. =Philanthropy= Alice donated to various charitable causes. Throughout her life she was a large supporter of the YMCA, Salvation Army, Red Cross, Trinity Church and St. Bartholomew's Church. She and her husband donated Vanderbilt Hall to Yale College in memory of their eldest son, Bill, a student there when he died in 1892. She gave the front gates to her former mansion on Fifth Avenue to be placed in Central Park. Mrs. Vanderbilt also donated a facility to Newport Hospital in 1903 in memory of her husband, Cornelius. =Descendants= Through her son, Reginald, Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt was the grandmother of Cathleen Vanderbilt, Gloria Laura Vanderbilt, the socialite and fashion designer, and the great-grandmother of news anchor Anderson Hays Cooper and his late brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper.

These aircraft are historically significant because they were the first to employ a joystick as their main flight control.  R.E.P. 1  The R.E.P. 1 in 1907 The REP 1 was a single-seat tractor configuration monoplane powered by a seven-cylinder two-row semi-radial engine driving a four-bladed propeller with aluminium blades rivetted to steel tubes. The fuselage was made largely of steel tubing covered in varnished silk and the wings of wood. An elongated triangular fixed horizontal stabiliser was mounted on top of the rear fuselage with a rectangular elevator mounted on the trailing edge, and a fixed fin and rudder were mounted under the fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping. The main landing gear consisted of a single centrally mounted wheel mounted on a pneumatic damper, with a small tailwheel mounted on the rudder. Large outrigger wheels were fitted to the tips of the wings, which featured marked anhedral. Esnault-Pelterie began testing the R.E.P. 1 in September 1907, initially flying the aircraft as a glider before attempting powered flights. Throughout October, these flights became increasingly successful. The R.E.P. 1 is preserved at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris.  R.E.P. 2  The R.E.P. 2 in 1908 The R.E.P. 2 in 1909 The R.E.P. 2 differed from the R.E.P. 1 in having a slightly different undercarriage (of the same general arrangement) in addition to a large ventral balanced rudder. Tests with the R.E.P. 2 commenced in June 1908, and on 8 June a flight of was made, reaching an altitude of 30 m (100 ft), setting a height and distance record for monoplanes. The aircraft was then modified by the addition of a trapezoidal dorsal fin, to create the R.E.P. bis. In this form, piloted by M. Châteaux, it won the third Ae.C.F. prize for a flight of over 200 metres on 21 November 1908, with an officially observed flight of . It was then exhibited at the Paris Aero Salon in December 1908 and at the Aero Show at Olympia in London in 1909.

JD and original Hirsute members Michael O'Neill (Princess, Ladybug Transistor) and Ginger Brooks Takahashi (LTTR, The Ballet) then comprised the core of MEN, with Johanna Fateman and artist Emily Roysdon contributing as writers, consultants, and producers. In 2009 MEN self-released an EP called MEN that sold out following US tours with Peaches and Gossip. MEN also toured in the UK and Europe during this time. Their debut album Talk About Body was released on February 1, 2011 via Iamsound Records in the US and through Sony/Columbia in Europe. With the release of the album, Takahashi was subsequently replaced by Tami Hart. Until the spring of 2012, the band was known simply as MEN, but changed the name to JD Samson & MEN for clarity and to emphasize the collaborative nature of the musical efforts on record and on stage. In response to the arrest of members of the Russian feminist punk rock protest group Pussy Riot in 2012, JD Samson & MEN released a single and music video entitled Let Them Out Or Let Me In. JD Samson has been an active member and spokesperson of the Free Pussy Riot movement. JD Samson & MEN released their second studio album, Labor, in October 2013, preceded by the release of two singles from the album including \\"All The Way Thru\\", for which they teamed up with French producer Yuksek. Like their 2012 EP Next, this album was self- released on the MEN Make Music label. In late 2014, Samson decided to dissolve the MEN collective and move on to other projects.

He later served as a Union colonel and as a leader of Jayhawker militias during the American Civil War. Early life and Bleeding Kansas Charles R. Jennison was born on June 6, 1834 in Antwerp, Jefferson County, New York. His family moved to Wisconsin in 1846 where Jennison studied medicine. Marrying at the age of 20, Dr. Jennison moved to Osawatomie, Kansas in 1858 and to Mound City, Kansas shortly thereafter.Wilkie, Frank B., edited by Banasik, Michael, Missouri in 1861: The Civil War Letters of Frank B. Wilkie, Newspaper Correspondent, Part IV, 2001, page 247, footnote 215 Jennison was considered the most brutal and unscrupulous of the jayhawker. Whereas some other prominent leaders of irregulars in the Bleeding Kansas border conflict shared these traits, Jennison was distinguished by his blatant plunder for personal gain.Castel, Albert, Civil War in Kansas: Reaping the Whirlwind, (), University Press of Kansas, 1997, page 43 Jennison cooperated with James Montgomery in opposing pro-slavery settlers and irregulars believed to be in league with Border Ruffians. In command of nine men, Jennison \\"tried\\" and hanged Russell Hinds near the state line at Mine Creek for the offense of helping to return a fugitive slave to his master in Missouri. Returning a slave was not only legal, but required at the time under the Fugitive Slave Act.Cutler, William G., History of the State of Kansas, A. T.

The regiment would become known as \\"Jennison's Jayhawkers.\\" It immediately took to the field patrolling the Kansas-Missouri border to prevent the secessionist under Sterling Price from crossing. Jennisons was a resolute abolitionist; his sentiments on the matter were the subject of an article in Horace Greeley's New York Daily Tribune. The article reported Jennison as refusing to allow non-abolitionist soldiers to serve under his command, and asserting that \\"the slaves of [southerners] can always find a protection in... [my] camp, and they will be defended to the last man and bullet.\\" While the regiment was at Leavenworth, Kansas in April 1862, Jennison, angered over James G.

It stars Paulette Goddard, Ray Milland, Constance Collier, Patric Knowles, Reginald Owen, and Cecil Kellaway as the English painter Thomas Gainsborough. In a broad interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, the film tells the rags-to- riches story of a beautiful young cockney guttersnipe who is given a complete makeover by an impoverished aristocrat (Milland) and his aunt (Collier) in hopes of arranging her marriage to a peer, thereby repairing their fortunes and their social status. Plot In the London slum of Houndsditch in 1783, Kitty is caught trying to pick the pocket of the painter Thomas Gainsborough. He offers to pay her more to sit for a portrait for him. There, she attracts the attention of Sir Hugh Marcy and the Earl of Carstairs. Sir Hugh, upon finding out her real social status, offers her a job as a scullery maid. Kitty learns that he is impoverished, having lost his post in the foreign office due to a scandal. Gainsborough's portrait, The Anonymous Lady, creates a stir, as people try to guess who the subject is. The Duke of Malmunster buys both that painting and Gainsborough's The Blue Boy. When the duke asks Gainsborough who the model is, Sir Hugh claims she is his aunt's ward. The duke admits he may have been mistaken in having Sir Hugh dismissed from his position (in favor of the duke's nephew), and in exchange for an introduction to Kitty \\"Gordon\\", offers to reinstate him. Sir Hugh, who had planned to avenge his dismissal, changes his mind in favor of monetary gain. He and his aunt, Lady Susan Dowitt, teach Kitty how to pose as a lady of fashion. What Sir Hugh does not count on is the attraction Kitty develops for him. When Hugh is sent to debtors' prison, Kitty charms the wealthy ironmonger Jonathan Selby into marrying her, using part of her dowry to free Hugh. Hugh is furious, but has to accept the situation. Hugh and Lady Susan soon spend the rest of the dowry and go back into debt. Kitty breaks into her husband's strongbox to get the pair out of debt, but Selby finds out and starts beating her. Seeing this, Kitty's loyal maid kills him, then commits suicide. Kitty inherits a large fortune and wants to find happiness with Hugh, but he is determined to marry her off to the duke and reclaim his career. Kitty gives in. After the honeymoon, the duke lets it become known that Kitty is pregnant (though the father is actually Selby). After the birth of the boy, the future 10th duke, the old dissolute 9th duke dies, leaving Kitty extremely wealthy. Kitty finally makes it clear to Hugh she married twice out of love for him. He, however, does not consider the relationship as anything other than business. The Earl of Carstairs, freshly returned from India, gets Kitty to agree to marry him. Hugh finally comes to his senses, but is unable to convince Kitty to break her engagement. Finally, he brings Old Meg to see her and Carstairs. Kitty tells Meg to tell all she knows about her old life, but Carstairs' love is unshaken. Defeated, Hugh genuinely congratulates Kitty and leaves. She realizes then that she will always love him and goes after him. Cast *Paulette Goddard as Kitty. To acquire a Cockney accent, Goddard shared a room for a time with the mother of actress Ida Lupino, who had a very pronounced one. She learned upper-class diction from Constance Collier.

Film rights were bought by Paramount prior to the novel's publication for a reported $50,000. In October 1943, Paramount announced they would make the film with Paulette Goddard and Ray Milland, with Karl Turnberg and Darrell Ware to write and produce. The novel was published that month. The New York Times called it \\"robust entertainment\\". By January 1946 it had sold almost 900,000 copies. In the original novel, Kitty was a prostitute. The Breen office, who handled censorship at the time, ruled if this was to be kept in the film version, Kitty would have to die at the end for punishment. The story was changed so Kitty was a pickpocket. In March 1944 Mitchell Leisen was given the job of directing and Cecil Kellaway was cast as Gainsborough. Director Leisen worked very hard with the set and costume designers to create a historically correct picture of 18th-century England. The California portrait painter Theodore Lukits served as technical adviser for the film's artistic scenes and painted the portrait of Kitty that is seen in the film. Lukits knew Ray Milland because he had painted his wife's portrait in 1942. Goddard was coached in her cockney accent by Connie Lupino, mother of Ida Lupino. In May 1944, before filming began, Goddard signed a new contract with Paramount to make two films a year over seven years. Filming started in May 1944. Leisen reportedly spent over $25,000 on recreations of Gainsborough portraits. Goddard made the film after returning from entertaining the troops in India and Burma. Milland made it immediately prior to The Lost Weekend. The ending of the film was re-shot in December 1944. Reception =Box Office= The film was popular earning over $3 million at the North American box office. =Awards= The film was nominated for one Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White (Hans Dreier, Walter H. Tyler, Samuel M. Comer, Ray Moyer). Radio adaptation Kitty was presented on Hollywood Players on CBS November 5, 1946. The adaptation starred Paulette Goddard.

After they were used by Hannibal during the Second Punic War, they were described by the Roman historian Livy as \\"by far the best horsemen in Africa.\\"Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 29.35.8. History The Numidian cavalry's horses, ancestors of the Berber horse, were small compared to other horses of the era, and were well adapted for faster movement over long distances.Epona Numidian horsemen rode without saddles or bridles, controlling their mounts with a simple rope around their horse's neck and a small riding stick. They had no form of bodily protection except for a round leather shield or a leopard skin, and their main weapon were javelins in addition to a short sword.RedRampant.com Due to their expert horsemanship and agility, as well as their lack of armor or heavy weaponry, they were most suitable for harassing tactics, charging in loose formation and lobbing their javelins before wheeling off to escape the enemy's counterattack. This harassing tactic, while rarely decisive, could be extremely frustrating to a less mobile enemy, as experienced by Julius Caesar's soldiers during the latter's invasion of Africa. At the same time, however, Numidians were generally unable to stand their ground against heavier types of cavalry. In one incident during the aforementioned African invasion, thirty of Caesar's Gallic horsemen drove off a much larger force of Moorish cavalry, while in another a squadron of Caesar's heavy Iberian horsemen routed a large body of Labienus's Numidians, while his Gallic and Germanic horsemen stood their ground. The Numidians were extremely useful during small wars, and their presence certainly contributed greatly to the effectiveness of Hannibal's reconnaissance and intelligence. Hannibal's invasion of Rome during the Second Punic War is best known for his use of slow-moving war elephants, but he also employed Numidian cavalry where faster movement was needed, such as luring the Romans into a trap at the Battle of TrebiaInvasion of Italy and for fighting on his right flank.

A part of the Central Valley Project, canal construction began in 1949 and was completed in 1951 at a cost of $60.8 million. The Friant-Kern Canal begins at the Friant Dam of Millerton Lake, a reservoir on the San Joaquin River north of Fresno, and flows south along the eastern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, ending at the Kern River near Bakersfield. In a typical year, it diverts almost all the flow of the San Joaquin River, leaving the river dry for about downstream. The Central Valley Project Delta-Mendota Canal replenishes the San Joaquin River at the town of Mendota, and replaces the volume of water being delivered by the Friant-Kern Canal. Average annual throughput is , with a high of in 2005, and a low of in 2015. In the past few years canal flows have been reduced due to river restoration projects requiring a greater release of water from the Friant Dam into the San Joaquin. The Friant-Kern Canal capacity is , gradually decreasing to at its terminus. The canal is built in both concrete-lined and unlined earth sections. It is up to wide at the top and is wide at the bottom of concrete segments, and wide in earth segments. Water depths range from .  Introduction  Fraint-Kern canal delivers water to numerous districts, cities, and up to 15,000 family farms. The canal stems from the Friant Dam located in the Sierra Nevada foothills, near the town of Friant. Built by the Bureau of Reclamation, the dam reaches a height of 319 feet and a length of 3,488 feet storing approximately 520,500 acre feet of water. In addition to storing water, the dam produces renewable energy through a 25 MW power plant operated by Friant Power Authority. Friant- Kern canal combats issues such as subsidence by providing water from the wetter northernmost part of the state to incentivize farmers to pump less groundwater. 2013, California 46 Bridge over Friant-Kern Canal, Central Valley Project Irrigation System - panoramio 2013, Friant-Kern Canal, Central Valley Project Irrigation System - panoramio Millerton Lake, Friant, California (21582117291) The Friant-Kern canal is part of a much larger project called the Central Valley Project or CVP. This water infrastructure system was created for many reasons, one being to ease the detrimental affects associated with excess ground water pumping, particularly by farmers, and to also support the necessary economic development to withstand the massive influx of people entering the state, especially between the years 1920–1950.  Central Valley Project  The Central Valley Project was an ambitious project built to address many different problems affecting the state. The CVP was intended to reduce the impacts of flooding, provide water for varying purposes within the valley, distribute water to different urban centers around the region, generate electricity, and to aid in conservation efforts. The entire project consisted of 20 dams and reservoirs which collectively store about 12 million acre feet of water.  Subsidence  Subsidence is caused by excess or unsustainable removal of groundwater, typically below an aquitard or confining layer. Up to 60% of the Friant-Kern canal water delivery capacity is negatively affected by land subsidence. This reduction in flow rates in the canal impacts both agricultural and groundwater basins within the service area. With current rates of subsidence, the canal will be operating at 30% capacity within three years. Decreased flow rates means more groundwater pumping by farmers and less groundwater recharge by state agencies. Both of these contribute to further subsidence and reductions in the ability to transport water during particularly wet years. By April 2017, the canal had subsided a total of twelve feet since its completion in 1949. The FWA estimates that current construction aimed towards fixing the subsidence problem will reduce the delivery of class 2 supplies by about 100,000 acre feet/year.  Environmental Impacts  Environmental impacts associated with the Friant-Kern Canal vary across the state. Salmon populations are impacted due to diversion of water from the natural stream flow. Along with depleted stream flows, the dam itself serves as a blockade against salmon traveling upstream in search of appropriate spawning grounds. Due to the diversion of water, dry reaches of riverbed are reported along some portions of the San Joaquin River. Along the river where the bed is dry, riparian habitats are suffering and native flora and fauna are impacted detrimentally. With dry riverbeds and salmon populations suffering, a lawsuit was filed which led to a settlement urging restoration of the river. The river is replenished by the Delta Mendota Canal, but not before negative impacts are observed.  Construction  Construction is needed to fix the canal where subsidence has impacted its functionality. Proposed construction consists of the excavation of 400,000 cubic yards of soil and 17,000 cubic yards of rock. Some other materials consist of 450,000 cubic yards of backfill is required along with 35,000 cubic yards of concrete lining material, 500,000 linear feet of aqualastic sealant and 85,000 cubic yards of riprap. To minimize any possible negative affects to biological resources, construction will occur when canal flows are low enough to avoid in-water work. Construction will also have an effect on air quality but only in the short term. The emission levels have been calculated to be under the federal and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District levels. Fugitive dust suppression is required to reduce air pollution as much as possible. Noise levels will also increase during the time of construction, however, disturbance coordinators will be designated with their contact information provided and all machinery will be fine-tuned and equipped with necessary noise mufflers. Restoring the canal has been postulated to provide an increase of local jobs to an economically depressed region.  Myriophyllum hippuroides  Myriophyllum hippuroides, also known as western watermilfoil has been impacting the canal for quite some time now. These weeds root themselves and reproduce in the earthen areas which are areas lacking cement canal lining. Unfortunately, this weed can also attach itself to cracks in the concrete. So after sometime floating down the canal, the weed may find another home to reproduce and propagate from. Chemical treatment is required for the successful removal of the aquatic weed which can grow up to ten feet long. This weed has been reported to clog canals, water meters, and micro irrigation sprinklers. Farmers who are trying to cut back on water usage by using micro irrigation technology are especially susceptible to clogging by these weeds.

Built in 1819, the long tunnel is believed to be the first full-size tunnel built in the United States, and is the first used to divert water for industrial purposes. It was designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1981, and a National Historic Landmark in 1994. Description and history The Montgomery Bell Tunnel is located in a unit of Harpeth River State Park, north of the town of Kingston Springs, Tennessee. In this area, the Harpeth River undergoes a series of meanders. In one of these, two parts of the river are quite close after a lengthy oxbow, known as the Narrows of the Harpeth. The tunnel runs roughly north-south across this isthmus. It is in length, and is dug entirely through limestone rock. Neither the tunnel nor its portals are lined in any way. The tunnel's profile shape that of a rectangle topped by a segmented arch, and is generally high and wide. The entrance portal is high and wide and the exit portal is high and wide. The tunnel has suffered some damage over the years due to erosive forces. Montgomery Bell, an entrepreneur from Pennsylvania who was involved in iron foundries in central Tennessee, purchased the land in this area in 1818. Recognizing the potential to apply water power to the process of producing wrought iron, he directed the construction of this tunnel, which facilitates use of a drop in river height for power generation. The tunnel is the first known example in the United States of a \\"full-scale\\" water diversion tunnel. It is also apparently the first \\"full-scale\\" tunnel of any type in the United States, its completion predating that of the Auburn Tunnel (1821) in Pennsylvania, whose construction was begun first. The tunnel is the only feature of Bell's iron works to survive; not surviving are a dam, head race, and the iron foundry itself, as well as Bell's house, which was built nearby. During the 1930s, the land in this area was leased to the Boy Scouts of America for use as a summer camp. It was deeded to the state in 1978. In the late evening, on September 2, 2011, a fire was lit in the tunnel. The amount of driftwood from 2010's flood in the tunnel enlarged the fire. The fire was eventually extinguished in the early hours of the morning. The tunnel, and the road passing over it, were damaged. It and the road were stabilized, however, and Montgomery Bell Tunnel is again safe.

His case took on prominence in the ongoing debate in the legal community over the reliability of eyewitness identification. After his release, he had become an activist for the wrongfully accused.  Trial and conviction  Carmona was arrested in Costa Mesa, California, just days after his 16th birthday; he had no prior criminal record and steadfastly maintained his innocence. When eyewitnesses failed to identify Carmona, police retrieved a Lakers cap obtained from the getaway driver and placed the hat on Carmona's head. With the hat from the getaway driver placed on Carmona's head, the eyewitnesses finally said Carmona was the robber.Bob Emmers, “Eyewitness Blues: How a Baseball Cap Derailed Justice”, Orange Coast Magazine (Sept. 1999) , retrieved February 16. 2013. During his interrogation with Irvine detectives, police repeatedly lied when they told Carmona that they had evidence—including videotape—proving that he had committed the robbery.Orange County Weekly - 'Hell, Yeah, I'm Angry' A 33-year-old man who admitted being the driver in the robberies identified Carmona as his accomplice as part of a plea bargain. An investigator for Carmona later said the man recanted and said he'd never met Carmona until they were arrested. Police never established a link between the two. In fact, no physical evidence linked him to the crimes, even though police recovered a handgun, a backpack and a getaway car used in the crimes.Opinion: The Orange Grove: Injustice came back for Carmona - OCRegister.com  Appeal and exoneration  Starting several months after Carmona's October 1998 conviction, it was Nadia Maria Davis, an attorney and activist, who first took on and brought attention to his plight.

Instead of apologizing for bad police work, overzealous prosecutors and Carmona's two years in state prison, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told Carmona he was lucky to be walking free and blamed the media for ruining his case. After getting out of jail, Carmona moved to San Diego and got a job installing carpet with his father. He also traveled with his mother, a paralegal, to Sacramento to meet with groups like the California Innocence Project, which seeks to free wrongfully convicted inmates in the state's prison system.  Death  In the months leading up to his death, Carmona had been dividing his time between advocating on behalf of wrongfully convicted inmates in the California prison system and taking firefighting classes at Santa Ana College. On February 17, 2008, his cousin began a fight and Carmona had attempted to stop the fight; which led to him being chased by those his cousin were fighting with and hit by a car.

It was founded in 1989 by Daniel G. Amen, a self-help guru and psychiatrist. The clinics perform clinical evaluations and brain SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging to diagnose and treat their patients. Amen Clinics uses SPECT scans, a type of brain-imaging technology, to measure neural activity through blood flow. It has a database of more than 100,000 functional brain scans from patients in 111 countries. Amen Clinics has locations in Newport Beach, California; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Reston, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; Chicago; Los Angeles; and New York City. The American Psychiatric Association has criticized the clinical appropriateness of Amen's use of brain scans, stating: \\"[T]he clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques for planning of individualized treatment has not yet been shown.\\" Operations Amen Clinics was founded in 1989. It has been using brain SPECT in an attempt to diagnose and treat psychiatric illness since 1991. Amen Clinics incorporates questionnaires, clinical histories, and clinical interviews in its practice. Some Amen Clinics locations also use quantitative electroencephalography as a diagnostic tool. Amen Clinics has scanned 50,000 people at an estimated cost of $170 million according to Daniel Amen. As of 2014, Amen Clinics had a database of more than 100,000 functional brain scans. The subjects are from 111 countries with ages from 9 months to 101 years old. The database was funded in part by Seeds Foundation in Hong Kong, and developed by Daniel Amen with a team of researchers including Kristen Willeumier. Amen Clinics has worked to treat athletics-related brain damage for professional athletes, including current and 117 former National Football League players. Effectiveness Amen Clinics uses SPECT scans to measure blood flow and activity patterns in the brain. The company also uses diagnostics such as questionnaires, clinical histories, and clinical interviews. Amen Clinics claims that SPECT scans enable doctors to tailor treatment to individual patients' brains. A retrospective study released by Amen in 2010 showed that \\"regional cerebral blood flow, as measured by SPECT, predicted stimulant response in 29 of 157 patients.\\"Adinoff & Devous, 2010 Response to Amen Letter American Journal of Psychiatry Harriet Hall has written critically about SPECT scans in articles for Quackwatch and for the Science-Based Medicine website. Hall accuses the clinics of misrepresenting an unproven treatment as effective, of concealing important warning information, and of creating false hopes by promising things that can't be done. She dismisses the scans as \\"pretty pictures\\" and says that although Amen himself seems to believe in his approach, \\"humans are very good at fooling themselves\\". A 2011 paper co-authored by the neuroscientist Anjan Chatterjee discussed example cases that were found on the Amen Clinic's website. The paper noted that the example cases \\"violate the standard of care\\" because a normal clinical diagnosis would have been sufficient and functional neuroimaging was unnecessary.

History =Background= The Jaina Bhagavati- Sutra of the 5th century AD mentions that Purulia was one of the sixteen mahajanapadas and was a part of the kingdom known as Vajra-bhumi in ancient times. In 1833, the Manbhum district was carved out of the Jungle Mahals district, with headquarters at Manbazar. In 1838, the headquarters was transferred to Purulia. After independence, when Manbhum district was a part of Bihar, efforts were made to impose Hindi on the Bengali-speaking majority of the district and it led to the Bengali Language Movement (Manbhum). In 1956, the Manbhum district was partitioned between Bihar and West Bengal under the States Reorganization Act and the Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act 1956. =Red corridor= 106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of the left wing extremism activities, constitutes the Red corridor. In West Bengal, the districts of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum are part of the Red corridor. However, as of July 2016, there had been no reported incidents of Maoist related activities from these districts for the previous 4 years. The CPI (Maoist) extremism affected the CD blocks in the Purulia district were: Jhalda I, Jhalda II, Arsha, Baghmundi, Balarampur, Barabazar, Manbazar II and Bandwan. Certain reports also included Manbazar I and Joypur CD blocks and some times indicted the whole of Purulia district. The Lalgarh movement, which started attracting attention after the failed assassination attempt on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, then chief minister of West Bengal, in the Salboni area of the Paschim Medinipur district, on 2 November 2008 and the police action that followed, had also spread over to these areas. The movement was not just a political struggle but an armed struggle that concurrently took the look of a social struggle. A large number of CPI (M) activists were killed. Although the epi-centre of the movement was Lalgarh, it was spread across 19 police stations in three adjoining districts – Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia, all thickly forested and near the border with Jharkhand. The deployment of the CRPF and other forces started on 11 June 2009. The movement came to an end after the 2011 state assembly elections and change of government in West Bengal. The death of Kishenji, the Maoist commander, on 24 November 2011, was the last major landmark. Geography CD blocks in Purulia district Arsha is located at .

SS (steamship) Talune was built by Ramage & Ferguson, of Leith, Scotland, for the Tasmanian Steam Navigation Company of Hobart, Tasmania, entering service with the company in 1890. It was of 2,087 tons, about 230 feet long, coal fired, and powered by a triple-expansion steam engine. It had passenger accommodation for up to 175 peopleNew Zealand Maritime Index and a crew of around 56.New Zealand Maritime Index Initially the Talune was employed on the Hobart-Sydney run for its parent company. In 1891, the ship was taken over by the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand when it absorbed the Tasmanian company and its assets. The Talune worked thereafter between New Zealand and Australia, and later between New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Early service No complete record of the Talune's many voyages has been found, but the ship appears in a number of records from the time. In November 1891, the Talune took the British poet and writer Rudyard Kipling from Wellington to Bluff, and then on to Melbourne as part of a world tour.‘The Kipling Journal’, December 1963, Volume XXX, no. 148, pps 7 – 9 His opinion of the ship is not recorded. New Zealand poll tax records show that in May 1896 it brought one Ah Lun, a 34-year-old Cantonese man to Wellington from Sydney.New Zealand Department of Ethnic Affairs Poll Tax records In June 1897, it carried Carl Hertz from Bluff to Hobart.‘The Big Picture’, Issue 11, Summer 1997, \\"The Illusionist and the Cinematographe – film pioneers of New Zealand\\", Clive Sowry, Media and Interdisciplinary Arts Centre / Toi Rerehiko Hertz was an American \\"Illusionist and Prestigidator\\" who was the most successful early exhibitor to show motion pictures in New Zealand. In 1901, the Talune was the setting for a lethal poisoning reported in the Otago Witness in April.National Library ‘PapersPast’, Otago Witness, Issue 2455, 3 April 1901, Page 25 In its early years, the Talune was involved in two recorded salvage operations. In 1898, it rendered assistance to the SS Ruapehu, stranded on Farewell Spit.New Zealand Maritime Record, ‘T. S. S. Waverly’ In 1899 the Talune fell in with the 5,500-ton Perthshire, which had gone missing on a voyage from Sydney to Wellington. For eight weeks, the Perthshire had been drifting helplessly without power in the Tasman Sea with a broken tailshaft. The Talune towed the larger ship back to Sydney.The Ships List First World War service The Talune saw service in the First World War as His Majesty's New Zealand Transport 16 (HMNZT 16)Katikati e-memorial for soldiers who left Katikati to serve in World War I transporting at least one contingent of troops to Western Samoa. At some time after 1916, the Talune reverted to civilian service and resumed its ordinary voyages. Stranding Talune's only known stranding occurred on 12 March 1917, in the Egeria Channel, off Nukualofa. The Talune was carrying general cargo and 15 passengers, so by this time may have already reverted to civilian service after serving as a military transport. There was £400 worth of damage done to plates and frames. The Court of Enquiry found the Talune struck an uncharted pinnacle rock, and there is no record of the Master (J. Morrison) being censured. Influenza in the Pacific On 7 November 1918, the Talune arrived at Apia in Western Samoa, on one of its regular Pacific voyages from Auckland, New Zealand, successively calling at ports in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Nauru, and then Fiji again before returning to Auckland. At that time the Western Samoan islands were administered by New Zealand, which had seized them from Germany at the start of the First World War in 1914. The United States of America controlled the Eastern islands. At the time of the Talunes departure from Auckland, pandemic influenza was spreading rapidly in New Zealand, resulting in many fatalities. Before leaving Auckland two crewmen had reported sick and were sent ashore, but by the time Talune reached Suva in Fiji on 4 November several more crewmen had influenza. As none of the local passengers was stricken, they were allowed ashore and the cargo unloaded while the ship remained in quarantine alongside the wharf, the Port Health officer having heard reports of the severe epidemic in New Zealand. As was the custom of the time, about 90 Fijian labourers were taken on board to work the cargo as the ship proceeded on its planned voyage. By the time the Talune reached Apia in Samoa on 7 November, most of the Fijian labourers were ill (Rice 200). The ship's quarantine at Suva was apparently not mentioned on arrival in Apia (Cliff 137) and the acting Port Health officer at Apia was not aware of the epidemic in Auckland (Rice 200). After what seems to have been a somewhat cursory examination the ship was granted pratique and passengers allowed to disembark. \\"[The] Talune's captain told the medical officer, Doctor Atkinson, that nothing was serious, but that \\"'One old reverend told me he had been sick back in Auckland, but he seems fine now. Two Samoan kids, Tau and Faleolo, had headaches yesterday but are up and around again today.'\\" The doctor \\"questioned the pastor and two boys as they went by\\", but no one complained of being ill. Two hours later the yellow flag was lowered. The Talune had a clean bill of health.\\"Tapuitea, American Samoa Government weekly newsletter, Vol II, No. 26, 14 November 2007, p.3 By 31 December, at least 7,542 Samoan people had died from the virulent influenza, and deaths from influenza continued into 1919. A commission of enquiry calculated a final death toll of about 8,500, about 22% of the whole population of Western Samoa (Rice 201). While the impact of the pandemic was undoubtedly amplified by the Samoan cultural response to illness, which requires the fono (family) to gather around a sick person, the New Zealand administrative response to the pandemic was certainly at least inept. Much more could have been done to reduce the impact on the population, such as prohibiting travel within and between islands.Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, Robert Logan The original decision to allow the Talunes passengers to land, along with other events during New Zealand's administration of Samoa, was the subject of an apology from the New Zealand Government delivered at a state luncheon in Apia in June 2002.Text of Apology The impact on Western Samoa was particularly poignant in view of the success of the American authorities in preventing pandemic influenza from gaining a foothold in islands under their administration (even though these were only about from the New Zealand-administered islands. Without orders from his government (but based on what he learned from a radio news service) the governor of American Samoa, Navy Commander John M. Poyer, instituted a rigorous quarantine policy. When he heard of the outbreak on Western Samoa, he banned travel to or from the neighbouring islands. Poyer persuaded the island's natives to mount a shore patrol to prevent illegal landings. People who disembarked from ships sailing from the American mainland were kept under house arrest for a specified period or examined daily. Aspects of the quarantine continued into mid-1920, a year after Poyer departed to the sound of a 17-gun salute. There were no influenza deaths on American Samoa.Washington Post, 4 June 2003, quoted in the Puerto Rico Herald The Talune went on from Apia to Tonga (calling at Neiafu, Vava'u, Ha'Apai) and to Nuku'Alofa in Tongatapu, where it arrived on 12 November 1918. Within a few days of the Talunes arrival, the disease had spread with heavy loss of life; estimates vary between 1,800 and 2,000 died, or about 8% to 10% of the Tongan population.Pacific Cooperation Foundation, Tonga photo gallery After Tongatapu the Talune sailed for Nauru, where once again the first cases of influenza appeared ashore within a few days of her departure. Disposal Nothing is known of Talune's employment after its disastrous 1918 voyage until 1921, when Union Steamship Company records show it was laid up. In 1925 the ship was hulked, and in November of that year was filled with rocks and scuttled to form the foundation of a breakwater at Waikokopu, a small port in northern Hawke Bay, on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand.Encyclopaedia of Australian Shipwrecks – New Zealand shipwrecks Remains The port of Waikokopu is no longer in use, and the wharf and the breakwater have been reduced to rubble by southerly swells.

It was written by Tim Calpin and Kevin Jakubowski. It premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. The film had been scheduled for limited theatrical release on February 27, 2009, but that release was postponed indefinitely following the bankruptcy of its distributor, Yari Film Group's releasing division. It was released on DVD in the United States on October 6, 2009. Plot Robert \\"Bobby\\" Funke is a less than popular high school sophomore with a dream to get into Northwestern University's summer journalism program. Although Funke claims he's a great writer, he has never finished an article for the school’s newspaper. Editor- in-chief Clara Diaz assigns Funke to do an article on Paul Moore, the student council president and star of the school’s basketball team. Funke is unable to get a story out of Paul and is bullied by Paul's friends. Principal Kirkpatrick discovers the upcoming SAT booklets have been stolen from a safe in his office. Kirkpatrick rounds up his \\"usual suspects\\" of misfits, including Funke. The group is innocent, but Kirkpatrick warns them to watch their step. When senior Francesca Facchini solicits Funke's help tracking down the stolen SATs, Funke slowly uncovers a story. His investigation links Paul to the crime, which he writes in an article for the school paper. Kirkpatrick forces Paul to open his locker and the SATs fall out. Funke becomes one of the most popular kids at school. Clara decides to submit his article to Northwestern, which earns him a scholarship to the summer program. Funke wins the respect of everyone, from Principal Kirkpatrick to Francesca, who asks him to a school dance. Paul confronts Funke, proclaiming his innocence, stating that he was already accepted to Cornell on a sports scholarship and did not need the SATs. Funke begins to wonder if he is just a pawn in a conspiracy, and he investigates Paul's shady friends, all members of the student council. He discovers their involvement with drug dealing. The council had actually stolen the SATs along with other tests throughout the year, modifying the marks of the best students to make them doubt their test-taking abilities and turn to the council for \\"study drugs\\". Paul wasn't in on the crime, so group ringleader Marlon Piazza had Paul framed to avoid being caught, while Marlon’s step-sibling and sex partner, Francesca, led Funke along to keep him from finding out the truth. Funke confronts the council in the principal's office. Marlon threatens to have Funke thrown out the window and frame it as a suicide, but his threat and confession are heard on the school's intercom system, which Bobby had secretly activated. Kirkpatrick rushes into the office, followed by Francesca. Francesca attempts to gain Funke’s trust, only to be shut down and left to her punishment.

Following a complete refurbishment by the new owners the distillery was re-opened on 24 November 2008 by the First Minister for Scotland Alex Salmond. History The Glenglassaugh Distillery is a single malt Scotch whisky distillery located in a picturesque site just outside the Speyside region in Northeast Scotland, close to the small town of Portsoy, Banffshire some 54 miles Northwest of Aberdeen. The Distillery was established in 1875 by a local entrepreneur James Moir and his two nephews, Alexander and William Morrison. James Moir had an expanding grocery business in the town of Portsoy and was wanting to establish a distillery that would produce a whisky of the highest quality to satisfy the growing demand from his customers. The site was originally chosen due to its proximity to a clean and pure water supply (Glassaugh Springs), easy access to the nearby barley fields and because it was known locally to have been the site of one of the many illicit distilleries that had operated in the area and which had produced excellent whisky. Following the death of both James Moir and William Morrison, Alexander Morrison was forced to sell the distillery and in 1892 the company was sold to Highland Distillers and until 2008 has been owned by them. Highland Distillers are a subsidiary of The Edrington Group. In 1960 it was rebuilt and upgraded to double the production capacity and to yield lighter spirit. However, in 1986, when the whole whisky industry was reviewing operations the economics of running this relatively small and remote distillery, the owners decided that they should stop production. Around this time, Glenglassaugh was sold to the Edrington Group. The whisky from this distillery had traditionally been used in the production of blended whiskies such as Cutty Sark, Laing's, and The Famous Grouse. In 2008, Glenglassaugh was purchased by the Scaent Group. Under new ownership, it released some the pre-1986 stock as exclusive Highland single malt scotch whiskies with outstanding success. At the 2009 International Wine and Spirit Competition awards the 30 Year Old expression was awarded a Gold Medal (Best in Class) and the trophy for Best Cask Strength Scotch Whisky and the 40 Year Old was awarded Gold Medal (Best in Class) and the trophy for Best 40 Year Old Scotch Whisky. The 40 year old was also awarded Best 40 Year Old Scotch Whisky and 96 points in Jim Murray's 2010 Whisky Bible. Upon purchase, Scaent refurbished the mothballed distillery and restarted production. In 2009 the company also introduced 2 new innovative products which are produced using the same process as that used for making single malt scotch whisky but without the ageing process. \\"The Spirit Drink that dare not speak its name\\" is the result of 1 mash of malted barley, fermented and distilled twice. The product is bottled without ageing at 50% abv. \\"The Spirit Drink that blushes to speak its name\\" is also produced in the same way but is allowed to age for 6 months in casks that have previously held red wine. The result is a spirit with a rich rose hue and a flavour of soft fruits and spices and is ideal as a cocktail base or for making long drinks. On 16 December 2011 the first bottling of Glenglassaugh whisky from spirit distilled under the present ownership was bottled and released for sale only from the distillery shop. In March 2013, The BenRiach Distillery Company acquired the Glenglassaugh distillery from its previous owners, who were listed as Amsterdam-based Lumiere Holdings. Benriach Distillery company also operates the Benriach and Glendronach Distilleries. In June 2016, Brown-Forman Corporation acquired the BenRiach Distillery Company and its subsidiaries, therefore making Brown-Forman the current owners of the Glenglassaugh distillery. The history of Glenglassaugh distillery up to and including the first launches by the Scaent Group was described by whisky writer Ian Buxton in his book Glenglassaugh: A Distillery Reborn (NWP, Glasgow. July 2010). Buxton also worked as marketing consultant and adviser to the relaunch.

A native of Owatonna, Minnesota, Laughlin worked winters during his youth as a fur trapper. He took the profits and used them to purchase slot machines for installation in hunting lodges. The young businessman was making $500 a week when his school principal gave him an ultimatum: get out of slots or get out of school. Since he was making more than three times what the principal was, he got out of school. Laughlin moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, in the late 1950s and purchased his first casino, the \\"101 Club.\\" By 1964, Laughlin had sold the 101 Club. That same year, Laughlin was flying his private plane over the California/Arizona/Nevada tri-state area near the Colorado River. Growth in the area, specifically in Bullhead City and Kingman in Arizona, and Needles in California, was spurred by the construction of nearby Davis Dam, completed in 1951. The area was also a major stop along Route 66. It was during that flight that Laughlin envisioned the potential of the area as a resort destination. Soon after, he purchased a shuttered, eight- room riverfront motel on for US$250,000. Though the landowner had several offers, he decided to sell the property to Laughlin because of his previous casino background. In less than two years the Riverside Resort was entertaining guests not only with gambling but with all-you-can-eat chicken dinners for 98 cents. Play at the casino was on twelve slot machines and two live gaming tables. Accommodations at the Riverside were available in only four of the motel's eight rooms; Laughlin's family occupied the remaining four. The Town of Laughlin is believed to have received its name when a U.S. Postal Service inspector asked Laughlin to give a name to the area post office in order to receive mail. Laughlin suggested the name \\"Riverside and Casino,\\" but the postal inspector in turn suggested \\"Laughlin\\" because of their common Irish heritage. In 1972, the property, now known as the Riverside Resort Hotel & Casino, underwent a major expansion with the addition of 48 new rooms. In 1975, 52 more rooms were added. Construction of a 14-story hotel/casino tower in 1983 added 253 rooms and in 1986, a second 14-floor tower added 307 more rooms and an automotive museum. With free admission to the public, the Riverside's extensive collection is an offshoot of the famous Harrah's collection. One longtime exhibit, a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro nicknamed \\"Big Red\\" and specially prepared for road racing, has been returned to service and was the cover story of the May, 2005 edition of Hot Rod Magazine. The largest expansion came in 1994 with the addition of 800 more rooms for a current total of 1405 rooms. A bowling center, one of only two in Laughlin, was constructed in 1999. Mr. Laughlin also helped finance the construction of a bridge over the Colorado River between the northern tip of Laughlin and the Laughlin- Bullhead International Airport (on the Arizona side), connecting Nevada Highway 163 with Arizona Highways 95 & 68\\\\. He also helped to finance the expansion of the airport to enable it to accept full-sized commercial airliners. Laughlin spends his time shuttling in his private helicopter between his penthouse suite atop the Riverside and his cattle ranch in nearby Kingman. He also uses his helicopter in travels back to his hometown of Owatonna, Minnesota, for the Steele County Free Fair, parking it in a vacant lot behind the Owatonna Country Inn & Suites before it was replaced by a cinema's parking lot.

Early life Alderete was born in Olmedo, Castille in 1518, the son of Francisco de Mercado and of Isabel de Alderete. He came to Peru in 1535, under the orders of Diego de Rojas who intended to undertake the conquest of the Gran Chaco region. The expedition had several difficulties attempting to reach the Pilcomayo River. Alderete settled down in Tarija, until he became a member of Francisco de Aguirre's force who joined Pedro de Valdivia's in the conquest of Chile in 1540. In Chile Jerónimo de Alderete was part of Pedro de Valdivia's expedition to settle in the Mapocho valley of Chile in 1540. He was a regidor of the first city government of Santiago, Chile in 1541. In 1544, he joined the expedition of Juan Bautista Pastene that was explore the lands to the south to the Straits of Magellan in the bark San Pedro. In 1550, during the campaign to establish Concepción he led the cavalry charge that broke the leading division of the Mapuche army at the Battle of Penco. In 1552 Valdivia ordered Jerónimo de Alderete to go inland and establish a fort at Lake Villarrica and established a fort at the site of the present Villarrica. In Europe In late 1552, Pedro de Valdivia dispatched Alderete to negotiate the confirmation of his governorship with Charles V, but after he arrived back to Spain he discovered that the Emperor had transferred the suzerainty of Chile, and all his other territories, to his son Philip II, who was at the time living in England. Alderete then travelled to London, where he met the King and obtained from him the governorship-for-life for Valdivia. As he was on the road to Spain to start the journey back to Chile, he received the news of the death of Valdivia, so he returned to England once more, where the King appointed him to succeed Valdivia on October 17, 1554, and named him Adelantado and a Knight of Santiago. In the meantime, back in Chile the will of Valdivia had also appointed him as his successor as governor of Chile, but that was disallowed by the Viceroy of Peru Melchor Bravo de Saravia, who appointed an interim governor. As Alderete was returning to America to assume his post he was taken ill with yellow fever in Panamá and died there on April 7, 1556.

He was one of the pioneers of minority rights activism in Nigeria. He was many parts and different things to different people - a university students leader, a teacher, policeman and Nigerian army officer. An undergraduate student of chemistry and student union president at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, he left school to lead an armed protest against the exploitation of oil and gas resources in the Niger Delta areas which benefited mainly the federal government of Nigeria and Eastern region with capital in Enugu and nothing was given to the Niger Delta people. He believed that the people of the area deserved a larger share of proceeds of the oil wealth. He formed the Niger Delta Volunteer Force, an armed militia with members consisting mainly of his fellow Ijaw ethnic group. They declared the Niger Delta Republic on February 23, 1966 and fought with federal forces for twelve days before being defeated. Boro and his comrades were jailed for treason. However, the federal regime of General Yakubu Gowon granted him amnesty on the eve of the Nigerian civil war in May 1967. He then enlisted and was commissioned as a major in the Nigerian army. He fought on the side of the Federal Government but was killed under mysterious circumstances in active service in 1968 at Ogu (near Okrika) in Rivers State. Niger Delta activists like Ken Saro-Wiwa, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari and many others often referred to him as a major inspiration.  Biography  = Early life = In his autobiography, \\"The Twelve-Day Revolution\\", Boro wrote about his early life: > \\"I am reliably informed that I was born at the zero hour of twelve midnight > on 10 September 1938, in the oil town of Olobiri along humid creeks of the > Niger Delta.

It is in the district of Sungai Siring. The airport is also colloquially known as Sungai Siring Airport, to distinguish it from its predecessor, the now-closed Temindung Airport. The airport is named after Aji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto, the first governor of East Kalimantan who was in office from 1957 to 1961. The airport started commercial operation on 24 May 2018, replacing the Temindung Airport. The airport is operated by UPBU Kelas II APT Pranoto, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Transportation. History Sungai Siring Airport was designed as a replacement for the former Samarinda Airport (commonly known as Temindung Airport) originally built in 1973. Located in the densely built-up Sei Pinang District with a single runway extending into settlements, Temindung had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 2000s, Temindung had become one of Kaltim's busiest airports – it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities. One out of every 25 flights experienced delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and runway. A 1992 planning study by Civil Aviation and Public Works departments identified the district of Sungai Siring, as a possible airport replacement site. Away from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over North Samarinda rather than populous urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. The Sungai Siring (SGS) airport master plan was completed in 1995. In 1998, however, the government shelved the project for financial and economic reasons. The Airport Location Study was undertaken by Indonesian consultants. This study came up with four recommended locations for overall strategic development in Samarinda. One of the four assumed a new airport at Makroman; a second assumed a new airport at Palaran; the third assumed a new airport at Sungai Siring; and the fourth assumed a new airport at Bayur.Dibangun Dibiayai dan Dikelola oleh Pemda Kaltim, Techno Konstruksi, September 2013 In November 2003 the Governor of Kaltim announced that a decision had been made on the Airport Location Study. The strategy was a replacement airport at Sungai Siring.Rencana Pemprov Yang Diambil Pemkot, Kaltim Post, June 2009 by Felanans Mustari ST The consultants advised that the earliest the airport could be opened was June 2009. However, in reaching the government's decision, this date was modified to December 2007. Construction of the new airport began in 2005. The construction period was very slow; specialists considered only 2–3-year period was sufficient for this aviation project. There was uncertain future of the airport construction after Panitia Pengadaan BSB manipulated the nomination of PT NCR as the contractor. It was originally believed that BPKP preferred to keep everything investigated and minimise financial commitments for the project temporarily, therefore stopping all construction. In practice, the airport did not finish in time for the investigation. However, Kaltim gave an additional year's deadline. Construction of the new airport was only part of the MP3EI Master Plan, which also involved construction of new road and rail links to the airport. The detailed design for the airport terminal was awarded to a consortium led by Waskita Karya with Airmas Asri as specialist designers for airport related aspects. Project architects were PT Waskita Karya. The airport was officially opened in an opening ceremony by President of Indonesia Joko Widodo and Governor Awang Faroek on 24 May 2018, concluding the twelve-year construction that cost US$0.4 billion. Facilities The airport covers an area of . The airport has 4 boarding gates, with four jet bridge gates. All jet bridges are capable of handling the Airbus A320. The airport has one runway, which is in length and wide. The runway is planned to be lengthened to 3,000 m in the future to accommodate wide-body aircraft such as the Airbus A330, Boeing 747, Boeing 767, and Boeing 777.

The center portion of the colonnade is fully pedimented four-column Greek temple portico, which projects forward from flanking pairs of columns, and another pair of columns set behind the end columns of the temple front. The interior of the house retains rich woodwork and plaster decorations in the Greek Revival style. History It was built in 1845 by George Washington Polk (1817-1892),George Washington Polk on Find a Grave one of the sons of Colonel William Polk and a relative of President James K. Polk.

Rattle and Snap was built with slave labor and is the largest, most extravagant mansion in Maury County.\\"Rattle and Snap Papers.\\" Albert Gore Research Center. George Polk and his family lived in this mansion for fifteen years, selling it in 1867 to Joseph Granberry. The Granberrys owned the property until about 1920, calling it \\"Oakwood Hall\\". During the American Civil War, many plantations and mansions in the South were either looted or burned by Union soldiers. Rattle and Snap survived, allegedly because the senior Union Army officer, a Freemason, noticed Polk's Masonic ring in his formal portrait and refused to damage the home of a fellow Freemason. After the war, the Polk family went bankrupt and could not afford the land or the mansion; Rattle and Snap was sold to Joseph John Granbery in 1867. The Granberys lived in the mansion for over fifty years.William R Polk, Polk's Folly: An American Family History, First Anchors Book Edition (New York: Anchor Books, 2001), xxiv; digital image, William R Polk, Family Search (familysearch.org ) It is said to have been given its name from the fact that the land on which it was built was won from the Governor of North Carolina in a game of chance called 'Rattle and Snap'.Rattle and Snap Plantation website It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971. and See also *Hamilton Place (Columbia, Tennessee) *Ashwood Hall *List of National Historic Landmarks in Tennessee *National Register of Historic Places listings in Maury County, Tennessee References External links *Rattle and Snap Plantation website *Nashville on the Move website * National Historic Landmarks in Tennessee Museums in Maury County, Tennessee Houses completed in 1845 Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Historic house museums in Tennessee Plantation houses in Tennessee Historic American Buildings Survey in Tennessee Houses in Maury County, Tennessee National Register of Historic Places in Maury County, Tennessee ","title":"Rattle and Snap"},{"id":"16068141","text":"Santa Rosa del Aguaray is a distrito in the San Pedro Department of Paraguay.

He wrote mostly in German. He is renowned for his travelogues from opening up the Julian Alps, in which he reflected on the relationship between man, nature, and culture. During all his life, he opposed competing nationalist ideologies in the Alpe-Adria region, insisting on the need of peaceful co-existence among Slovene, Italian and German peoples.  Biography  Julius Kugy was born to Slovenian family in Gorizia, then part of the Austrian Empire (now in Italy). His father Paul was a farmer from Lind (Lipa) near Arnoldstein in the Carinthian Gail Valley. His mother Giulia was the daughter of the Slovene poet Janez Vesel. The surname Kugy has the same origin as the surnames Kugi, Kogoj, and Kogej. Kugy was educated in a multi- lingual environment: from an early age he was fluent in three of the four languages of his native Gorizia and Gradisca region: Italian, German, and Friulian. Kugy did not speak Slovene, as he also writes in his book Aus dem Leben eines Bergsteigers. However, he did later learn to read Slovene. During his childhood he would spend the summers in his father's native village of Lind, where he developed his interest in nature and mountains. Julius attended the German-language secondary school in Trieste and continued his studies at the University of Vienna, graduating in law in 1882. Upon returning to Trieste, he took over the management of the import-export company Pfeifer & Kugy, co-founded by his father. He explored large portions of the Eastern Alps, dedicating most of his mountaineering career to climbing in the Julian Alps, where he discovered and marked more than 50 new routes. Local guides helped him climb many a previously unconquered peak in the Julian Alps: he became famous for climbing Škrlatica and Jôf di Montasio. In addition to mountaineering, Kugy was interested in many other subjects such as literature, botany and music. One of the riddles he tried to solve was a mysterious plant species Scabiosa trenta, described by Belsazar Hacquet and later proven by Anton Kerner von Marilaun to be a specimen of the already known Cephalaria leucantha. Together with his friend Albert Bois de Chesne he created an Alpine botanical garden near Bovec. He was among the founders of two amateur music societies in Trieste: the Philharmonic Society and the Palestrinian Chorus. He also donated an organ to the Mekhitarist church in Trieste. After Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary in 1915, Kugy volunteered to the Austro- Hungarian Army. In the Battles of the Isonzo his mountaineering knowledge and experience proved to be extremely valuable and he was promoted to the rank of Second Lieutenant. He was demobilized after the Battle of Caporetto. After the War he closed down his company and dedicated his time to writing and lecturing throughout the Slovene and German speaking lands. During World War II, Kugy rescued several Slovene alpine climbers from the Dachau concentration camp, and collaborated with the Slovene partisan underground resistance in Trieste. He died in Trieste in 1944. He was interred in the central city cemetery.  Literary work and influence  Memorial plaque in Trieste Together with Henrik Tuma, Kugy is considered the father of modern mountaineering in the Julian Alps. He wrote several books based on his experiences, in which he expressed his humanist ideals and the love for nature. His books were very influential and created a specific genre of mountaineering literature within Slovene literature. His neo-Romantic style, which merged scientific and naturalist descriptions of nature and popular customs with a highly personalized reflections, influenced several important authors, mostly from the Slovenian Littoral. Among those influenced by Kugy's poetic and reflective mountaineering travelogues were Klement Jug, Vladimir Bartol, Igor Škamperle and Dušan Jelinčič. He was also influential in some Italian-speaking circles of Trieste. Among his admirers were the writers Giani Stuparich, Claudio Magris, Livio Isaak Sirovich, Marco Albino Ferrari and Paolo Rumiz. There is a monument to Julius Kugy in the Trenta Valley near the road to Vršič PassMonument to Dr.Julius Kugy – Cultural and Historical Heritage – Slovenia – Official Travel Guide with a sculpture of Kugy by Jakob Savinšek. A number of mountain routes are also named after him, including the famous one in Aurisina near Duino. In 2008, a Slovenian postal stamp was dedicated to him.

History After Pedro de Valdivia reached the Bio-Bio River on January 24, 1550, he began to explore the river valleys and engaged in clashes with increasing numbers of Mapuche warriors. After about ten days he turned toward the sea marching to a plain between the Bio-Bio and Andalién River with a lake protecting his camp on one side. Here he stayed for two days and nights. On the second night the Toqui Ainavillo and 20,000 warriors in three divisions, came out of the local wooded hills and advanced on the Spanish camp believing the night would render the Spanish horsemen ineffective and possibly make the horses timid. They also hoped to catch the Spanish unaware. However, the Spanish were on alert; each night Valdivia had had half his soldiers standing watch at all times during the night and all asleep were ready to wake and face any night attack. The lake forced the Mapuche to approach the camp on one side so they were pressed close together by the lake and river forming a dense column. The night attack was defeated after a fierce three-hour battle. Valdivia was not able to break the dense Mapuche formation using cavalry charges, and his horses were often wounded in the fighting. Valdivia eventually ordered his men to dismount and fight on foot with his other soldiers. The armoured Spaniards' swords and shields, as well as arquebuses and the arrows of the Mapochoes eventually killed about three hundred Mapuche and wounded many more. Those that died were pressed forward by the warriors behind so that they left piles of bodies before the Spanish line. Finally the Mapuche were driven back, tired, their ranks thinned and in disorder, their archers without arrows. Seeing this the Spaniards countercharged and broke them just at dawn. Valdivia then sent Michimalonco and his 300 Mapochoes to pursue them, killing many others in this pursuit into the woodlands. Altogether 3,000 Mapuche were killed in the battle and pursuit according to Lobera. The Spaniards suffered just one death, due to friendly fire, but many soldiers had wounds as did many of their mounts. After a day treating the wounded they continued onward towards their rendezvous at Penco on the Bay of Concepción with the ships of Juan Bautista Pastene.

The Kaunas offensive was executed by the 3rd Belorussian Front on July 28 – August 28, 1944, with the aim of destroying the German concentration on the western bank of the Neman river, the occupation of Kaunas, and reaching the boundaries of East Prussia. Planning After completing the Vilnius Offensive Operation, the troops of the 3rd Belorussian Front (the 11th Guards, 5th, 31st, 33rd, 39th Armies, the 5th Guards Tank Army and 1st Air Army) were engaged in intense fighting with German forces on the approaches to the Neman river during the second half of July, and were preparing for the continuation of the offensive. They were resisted by formations and units of the Third Panzer and Fourth Armies of the German Army Group Centre, under the command of Field-Marshal Walter Model. Towards the end of July, German units concentrated in the direction of Kaunas, according to Soviet estimates, included elements of 10 infantry and 2 tank divisions, 2 infantry brigades and 30 separate regiments and battalions. Stavka assigned to the forces of the Front the mission of pressing home the attack on the Kaunas axis not later than 1–2 August, through assaults by the 39th Army together with the 5th Guards Tank Army from the north, and the 5th and 33rd Armies from the south to occupy Kaunas – the most important defensive position on the approaches to East Prussia. The plan called for the Red Army troops to advance to the borders of East Prussia by the 10 August and assume a defensive configuration in preparation for advancing into East Prussia. As with the parallel defence against the Belostock Offensive to the south, Model concentrated on a holding and delaying action using the few units available to him. The German Order of Battle for mid-July showed units from a large number of divisions in the area, but many of these were fragments that had escaped from the encirclement of the bulk of Army Group Centre in the previous phases of Operation Bagration; see deployments below.Hinze, p.42, gives a full OOB Deployments =Wehrmacht= *Third Panzer Army (Colonel-General Georg-Hans Reinhardt) **Korpsabteilung G (remnants of 95th, 197th and 256th Infantry Divisions that had escaped the previous phase of Operation Bagration) **XXVI Corps (parts of 6th Panzer and other divisions) (General Gerhard Matzky) **IX Corps (remnants) (General Rolf Wuthmann) *Northern wing of Fourth Army (General Kurt von Tippelskirch to 18 July, then General Friedrich Hoßbach) **XXXIX Panzer Corps (reconstructed) (General Dietrich von Saucken) **7th Panzer Division =Red Army= *3rd Belorussian Front (General Ivan Chernyakhovsky) **11th Guards Army (General Kuzma Galitsky) **5th Army **33rd Army (Lieutenant-General Vasily Kryuchenkin) **39th Army (Lieutenant-General Ivan Lyudnikov)Part 4, Людников И.

By July 30 the German resistance on the approaches to the Nemunas was broken. In the 33rd Army sector, the 2nd Guards Tank Corps was introduced into the breakthrough: their rapid advance to Vilkaviškis threatened the German forces before Kaunas with encirclement and the Germans were forced to retreat. Using the success of the Tank Corps, the troops of the 33rd Army entered and secured Vilkaviškis and the railway station of Mariampolė on 31 July. Troops of the 5th Army broke into Kaunas and on the morning of 1 August took control of it. Towards the beginning of August the forces of the Front advanced up to 50 km and subsequently enlarged the breakthrough to 230 km, occupying more than 900 villages, townships, towns and small cities. During August, Raus' Third Panzer Army was reinforced and mounted a counter-offensive on the Front's northern flank in Operation Doppelkopf. German troops also delivered a series of strong counter-attacks south-west and west of Kaunas. Having countered these, the 3rd Belorussian Front's troops moved a further 30–50 km and advanced towards deliberately prepared German fortified positions on the line east of Raseiniai and Kybartai - Suwałki. From 29 August on the orders of Stavka, the Front went over to the defensive. As a result of the Kaunas operation the forces of the 3rd Belorussian Front reached the eastern borders of East Prussia.

Life and career Giordano was born to a Sicilian father and a German Jewish mother in Hamburg. Because his mother, a piano teacher, was Jewish, the family was persecuted repeatedly after the Nazis seized power in January 1933. Ultimately, they survived the Holocaust by hiding in a friend's cellar. After his wartime experiences, Giordano temporarily became a communist. In 1955, he settled in the German Democratic Republic, but soon grew disillusioned because of his dislike of Stalinism and returned to Hamburg (in West Germany). Giordano left the German Communist Party in 1957. In 1961, he published The Party is Always Right! about his break with communism and the crimes of Josef Stalin. In 1958, Giordano reported on West German trials of Nazi war criminals for the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). In 1964, he joined the Cologne-based West German Broadcasting organization (Westdeutscher Rundfunk — WDR) as a journalist and remained there until 1988. In 1982, he published his most widely known work, Die Bertinis, a semi-autobiographical novel portraying the experiences of a family of mixed ethnic heritage (including Jewish) from the end of the 19th century through the end of World War II. In 1988, it was presented in a television series aired on the Second German TV network (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, or ZDF). Thereafter Giordano worked as a freelance writer and wrote numerous articles about his experiences in Nazi Germany and about the dangers of Neo-Nazi movements. He saw Islam as a threat: In a New York Times interview in 2007, he vehemently opposed the construction of a new mosque in Cologne, citing German mosques as \\"a symbol of a parallel society\\", and called the integration of German Muslims \\"a failure\\". While working on German television programs, Giordano produced the first TV documentary on the Armenian Genocide.Andreas Maislinger, Coming to Terms with the Past: An International Comparison, in Russell F. Farmen (ed.), Nationalism, Ethnicity, and Identity: Cross National and Comparative Perspectives, London and New York: Routledge, 2016, p. 174. =Personal life= Giordano was married three times. His longtime first wife, Helga, died of cancer in 1984. He and his second wife, Tanja, were divorced in 1988 after one year together. Giordano was married to his third wife, Roswitha Everhan, from 1994 until her death from cancer in 2002. He lived in Cologne. Giordano was a close friend of black German-American journalist Hans Massaquoi since their Swingjugend times in wartime Hamburg.

The village name Rettenbach was not mentioned yet, but the old Slavic name of the nearby hamlet Grodnau (meaning \\"the village belonging to the castle\\") is a sign of the existence of a nearby castle, identifiable with castle Bernstein. Bernstein Castle is above sea level.Bernstein Castle Altitude and Position Since 1199 the castle was part of Hungary. It is not exactly known when the castle was handed over to Frederick II, Duke of Austria, and how long it was his property; but in 1236 Béla IV of Hungary conquered the castle. Some years later (in 1260) he gave it to count Henry I Kőszegi. In 1336 the counts of Güssing and Bernstein were defeated by the Hungarian King Charles Robert of Anjou, and the castle of Bernstein became part of the Hungarian Kingdom. In 1388 the castle was given to the Kanizsai family. In 1482 it became property of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary for a short time; in 1487 Hans von Königsberg received the castle from Emperor Frederick III. In 1529 the Turks besieged the castle, but they were not able to capture it. Another unsuccessful siege by the Turks followed in 1532. On that occasion the ring of bastions was erected in order to change the castle into a refuge. In 1604 castle Bernstein was unsuccessfully besieged for weeks by a combined army consisting of Hungarians, Turks, and Tatars under the leadership of Stephen Bocskay. Due to an explosion of the gunpowder storeroom, in 1617 Ludwig Königsberg ordered the rebuilding of the Gothic inner part of the castle in Baroque style. The keep and towers were eliminated. A short time later (1644) Ehrenreich Christoph Königsberg sold the sovereignty and the castle to Count Ádám Batthyány. In 1864 Gustav Batthyány sold the castle to his manciple Edward O'Egan, whose heirs finally sold the castle to Eduard von Almásy. His family currently owns the castle.

Life and work Born as Janez Vesel in Spodnje Koseze in the Duchy of Carniola in the Habsburg Monarchy (now in Slovenia), Koseski studied law in Graz and Vienna and worked in Trieste for most of his professional life. In his student years, he mostly wrote in German. In 1818, his sonnet (\\"The Comfort\\") was the first sonnet ever printed in Slovene. No further works by Koseski are known until 1844, when he published his ode (\\"Slovenia to Emperor Ferdinand\\"), dedicated to Emperor Ferdinand. The poem where he describes the history of the Slovene Lands since the Roman times is widely regarded as his best work. Afterwards, he continued writing and also translating poetry. Vesel was a grandfather of the Austrian- Italian mountaineer and author Julius Kugy. He died in Trieste. Word Slovenija Vesel's 1844 ode was long considered the earliest known printed use of the word (\\"Slovenia\\"), at the time referring to the Slovene Lands. In the early 1990s, it was found that the word was printed already in 1841 in the book (\\"The Ancient and Today's Slovenes\\") by the Russian writer Yuriy Venelin.

In Latin literature, they would also be called popina, caupona, hospitium or stabulum, but archaeologists call them all thermopolium. The forerunner of today's restaurant, the items served at the thermopolia are sometimes compared to modern fast food. These places were mainly used by those who simply could not afford a private kitchen, often inhabitants of insulae, sometimes leading them to be scorned by the upper class. Design A typical thermopolium would consist of a small room attached but not accessible to a house with a distinctive masonry counter in the front. An example of this can be seen in Ostia in the House of the Painted Vaults. Embedded in this counter were earthenware jars (called dolia) used to store dried food like nuts (hot food would have required the dolia to be cleaned out after use, and because they are embedded in the counter, it is believed that they were not used to store hot food, but rather dried food where cleaning wouldn't be necessary). A dolium in the thermopolium attached to the House of Neptune and Amphitrite in Herculaneum had the carbonized remains of nuts. Fancier thermopolia would also be decorated with frescoes. Well-preserved ruins of thermopolia can be seen in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia. Thermopolium of Asellina A thermopolium in Pompeii The Thermopolium of Asellina is one of the most complete examples of a thermopolium in Pompeii. Complete jugs and dishes were found on the counter, as well as a kettle filled with water. The ground floor in the Thermopolium of Asellina was used for people to eat and drink, and some stairs led to guest rooms on the second floor. It had a typical structure consisting of a wide doorway open to the street, a counter with holes where four jars were set into it (dolia) for food or wine. It had shrines for the Lares (household gods), Mercury (god of commerce) and Bacchus (god of wine), as these were the most important gods for this occupation. Upstairs, there were guest rooms as well, so this may have also been used as an Inn; however, some think that this may have been a brothel due to the names of many women written as a part of an election notice on one of the outside walls of the Thermopolium. Another theory is that these were the slave-girls who worked as barmaids. Behind the bar were remains of wooden racks suspended from the ceiling to stack amphorae.

The Log Cabin at the University of Pittsburgh, located near Forbes Avenue, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania adjacent to the school's Cathedral of Learning, serves as a landmark that symbolizes the university's origins on the 18th Century western frontier of the early United States. The current log cabin, estimated to date from the 1820s to 1830s, was reconstructed on the university's campus for its bicentennial celebration in order to represent Pitt's original log structure that served the institution through the school's founding in 1787 to the construction of a brick building sometime in the 1790s. The Log Cabin often appears in images and promotional material, particularly when relating to the history of the university. Modern history The log cabin is located on the lawn of the university's Cathedral of Learning (center background) and next to the school's Stephen Foster Memorial (background left) The idea of placing a log cabin, which had come to symbolize the university's origins, on Pitt's campus in order to commemorate the university's approaching bicentennial in 1987, came from then Chancellor Wesley Posvar and University Trustee Charles Fagan III. This particular cabin originated from Yatesboro/Rural Valley area of Pennsylvania located about 50 miles from Pittsburgh. Estimated to date from the 1820s to 1830s, the log house had been sided with clapboards and used as a residence. It was purchased at an auction for $1,000 by Fagan, who donated it to the university in honor of his wife Ann Ebbert Fagan, who graduated from the university's School of Arts and Sciences in 1962. The cabin was disassembled and transported to Pittsburgh where its reconstruction was begun on September 10, 1986. Brad Moody of Heritage Restorations of Ligonier, Pennsylvania was the contractor for the disassembly and reassembly. The building's porch and chimney are new conjectural additions based on Heritage Restorations' expertise with similar buildings. Additionally, some original logs were replaced with the company's stockpiles, and a new wood shingle roof was installed, along with newly fabricated doors and windows. For a time after its completion, through at least part of the 1990s, the log cabin served as a visitors' information center. It is currently used by the Cathedral of Learning grounds maintenance staff to store salt for winter deicing. Symbolism, history, and legend Artist rendering of the original log cabin of the Pittsburgh Academy Details of one of the cabin's corner joints Tradition of the university, then the Pittsburgh Academy in the 1780s, and scattered evidence suggests that the school began life in a log cabin. A lack of concrete information of Pitt's early days can be blamed on the fires of 1845 and 1849 that wiped out most of Downtown Pittsburgh, where the school was then located. For this reason, very few records about Pitt's early days exist, and definitive information on classes being held in a log cabin is scarce. Records do exist of a gathering of individuals discussing the need for a new school, which was to become Pittsburgh Academy, occurring in a log house near the Point (this meeting was known to take place but the records from the meeting were lost). According to Pitt historian Agnes Lynch Starrett, there is \\"plenty of evidence that classes were held in a log building, even before the charter was granted\\". Most structures in 1787 Pittsburgh, then the frontier of America, were wooden structures or log cabins. Further, it appears other schools in the area, such as Washington and Jefferson College whose first building was known to be John McMillan's Log School, also operated out of similar structures. In the 1790s, a two-story, three-room, brick building was erected for Pitt Academy on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley. It is also known, that the school owned both its brick building and a log house next to it that served as the home to its principal. It seems in the very least that it can be inferred that Pitt Academy had an early log building in its possession. Even if the history of the school starting in a log cabin is factually unclear, it has been a tradition told within the university for over 100 years and at least represents the era of Pitt's founding, if not the actual 1st meeting in a log cabin to discuss the institution's creation. Since then, the image of a log cabin has become an iconic representation of the university's origins and has appeared on numerous publications and promotional items celebrating the university's sesquicentennial, bicentennial, and other anniversaries.

In many cases these functions can be performed by trained humans. However, because of the speed of, for example, a rocket's dynamics, human reaction time is too slow to control this movement. Therefore, systems—now almost exclusively digital electronic—are used for such control. Even in cases where humans can perform these functions, it is often the case that GNC systems provide benefits such as alleviating operator work load, smoothing turbulence, fuel savings, etc. In addition, sophisticated applications of GNC enable automatic or remote control. * Guidance refers to the determination of the desired path of travel (the \\"trajectory\\") from the vehicle's current location to a designated target, as well as desired changes in velocity, rotation and acceleration for following that path. * Navigation refers to the determination, at a given time, of the vehicle's location and velocity (the \\"state vector\\") as well as its attitude. * Control refers to the manipulation of the forces, by way of steering controls, thrusters, etc., needed to execute guidance commands while maintaining vehicle stability.

The sails are across and used to be covered with canvas. The last millstones were across and the millstones used to grind wheat for flour and beans for cattle food. The first mill on the site was medieval, but the present structure probably dates from the 18th century. It was modernised in 1900 with machinery brought from the demolished Moorlinch mill, and iron hoops around the building being added. It was restored in 1967. The mill has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. It is now preserved, having been given to Bristol City Museum in 1966 and is owned by Sedgemoor District Council, and maintained by volunteers. In 2008 the council applied for listed building planning consent to undertake major restoration work on the windmill, including replacement of the stone steps, installation of hand rails, guard rails and safety bars, alterations to the window shutters and replacement of the sail frames with wood laminate. In 2010 Sedgemoor Council decided it could no longer afford to maintain the windmill and has appealed for an independent group of trustees to take on the responsibility for the building.

After her education at Thanet Hall, Margate, and a Paris finishing school, Wyles broke off the legal studies she had begun at her father's instigation, to serve as a hospital nurse in the First World War. Career Lilian Wyles started her police career in February 1919 as one of three sergeants in the Metropolitan Women Police Patrols, covering Central London and the East End but without the power of arrest. The patrols met with scorn from male policemen and from members of the public,Louise A. Jackson: Women Police.

People stopped and commented within earshot: 'How queer.' 'How unwomanly.' 'Not quite nice, do you think? However, they were given tasks such as escorting lost children.Joan Lock: The British Policewoman (London: Robert Hale, 2015) Retrieved 25 October 2015 Largely thanks to her efforts, the patrols' women were given attested status within the Metropolitan Police in 1923, i. e. with the power of arrest. As one of the first women in such a position, her relations with male colleagues were uneasy, although she enjoyed the confidence of the chief constable of the CID, Frederick Porter Wensley, until his retirement in 1929. Wyles was instrumental in making it a task for women policemen, not of outside \\"assistants\\" to take statements from women in cases of sexual assault, as \\"detailed knowledge of the rules of evidence was required for a statement to be both useful and admissible. In 1922 Wyles was given responsibility for the taking of statements in all cases involving children and young girls that arose north of the Thames....\\" (pp. 186–187). Greater respect came in 1928, after the part she took in a case involving alleged sexual misconduct by Leo Chiozza Money and Irene Savidge, despite being initially spurned by Chief Inspector Alfred Collins, who was in charge of the case.Biography of Wyles on the Rhode Island College site (Russell A. Potter) Retrieved 25 October 2015. Lilian Wyles was promoted to chief inspector in 1932 and retired to Penzance, Cornwall, in 1949.

History In 19th Century New York, mock auctions revolved around the sale of cigars, horses and high quality furniture. In Denver, confidence man Soapy Smith and his Soap Gang auctioned off shiny brass watches as being made of gold. Other items were soap and candy wrapped with cash prizes. In more recent years the focus has been on electronic consumer goods. Operation Typically, during the sale, members of the gang operating the scam will pose as customers; they will be given boxes of high-value goods for a very low price, and will pretend to be very pleased with their bargain purchases. In reality, these goods are handed back and forth between the fake 'lucky customers' and the sellers, out of view of the real customers, after each time the con is completed. The fake auctioneer, who is usually the gang's leader, will often be a skilled, practised orator, who will typically be able to win the confidence of a substantial proportion of his potential victims. Techniques Commonly employed techniques include selling what appear to be boxed, high-quality branded goods, but which are actually very inferior, cheap fakes; or are rejects which have serious faults. Alternatively, the boxes may contain only blocks of wood or breezeblock or bottles of water etc. The gang will have members in the audience throughout the deployment of the scam, and will not allow customers to open any of their purchases in the shop/market. They will quickly lock up, and/or escape before any of the victims realise that they've been conned. No-one will be given genuine receipts or guarantees, although the gang may claim these documents are within the sealed boxes. In common with many confidence tricksters, the gangs very often move from town to town, city to city etc. to reduce the risk of them being caught. They have been known to use violence when a lone (prospective) victim confronts them.

Informally, the conditionality principle can be taken as the claim that experiments which were not actually performed are statistically irrelevant. Together with the sufficiency principle, Birnbaum's version of the principle implies the famous likelihood principle. Although the relevance of the proof to data analysis remains controversial among statisticians, many Bayesians and likelihoodists consider the likelihood principle foundational for statistical inference. Formulation The conditionality principle makes an assertion about an experiment E that can be described as a mixture of several component experiments Eh where h is an ancillary statistic (i.e. a statistic whose probability distribution does not depend on unknown parameter values). This means that observing a specific outcome x of experiment E is equivalent to observing the value of h and taking an observation xh from the component experiment Eh, for example, rolling a dice (whose value is h = 1 ... 6) to determine which of six experiments to conduct (experiment E ... E). The conditionality principle can be formally stated thus: :Conditionality Principle: If E is any experiment having the form of a mixture of component experiments Eh, then for each outcome (E_h, x_h) of E, [...] the evidential meaning of any outcome x of any mixture experiment E is the same as that of the corresponding outcome xh of the corresponding component experiment Eh actually conducted, ignoring the over-all mixed structure of the experiment (see ).

The wharf has sitting areas, patches of lawn, and several tourist attractions. By way of the Congress Street Bridge, Children's Wharf is a short walk from South Station, one of Boston's principal transportation hubs. The wharf is one of the more easily accessible locations on the Harborwalk, a newly established walking tour akin to the Freedom Trail, intended to take advantage of the change in landscape brought about by the Big Dig. Boston Children's Museum The wharf takes its name from Boston Children's Museum (founded in 1913), which moved here from Jamaica Plain in 1979. The museum is housed in a former industrial building expanded and renovated by Cambridge Seven Associates to take full advantage of the dramatic waterfront site.Cambridge Seven Associates In 2007 the museum completed a $47 million renovation and expansion. The improvements include green features such as green roofs, storm water reclamation to reduce run-off into Fort Point Channel, and building materials that are recycled, local, and low-emitting to qualify the Museum for the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification.About Boston Children’s Museum Boston Children’s Museum: Being Green Au Bon Pain is located on the ground floor of the museum in a space formerly occupied by McDonald's. Hood Milk Bottle The Hood Milk Bottle, originally constructed in Taunton, Massachusetts, is an iconic tourist attraction on Children's Wharf. It serves as an ice cream stand and snack bar. At tall and in diameter, the structure now known as the Hood Milk Bottle was originally constructed in 1933 on the banks of the Three Mile River in Taunton, Massachusetts. Abandoned in 1967 and photographed by Walker Evans in 1974, the bottle was cut into three sections and moved by barge to Boston in 1977. Reassembled on the wharf, the Depression-era structure resumed its original function as an ice cream stand and snack bar. In 2006, the bottle was \\"uncapped\\" (its original top half was sliced off and preserved) so that its base could be moved slightly and rebuilt on a newly renovated Children's Museum Plaza. It was officially re-dedicated by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino on April 20, 2007, thirty years to the day after it was moved to the wharf.\\"The Hood Milk Bottle Through the Years\\". Boston.com.

Three of the onboard experiments continued research from the first two missions and two experiments were designed for new research topics. It was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 5 May 1967, making it the first satellite of the program to launch from the West coast. Ariel 3 was shut down in September 1969, and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere 14 December 1970. This was the first artificial satellite designed and constructed in the United Kingdom. Design =Development= In 1961 the UK Space Research Group accepted proposals for experiments to be carried on the third satellite of the Ariel programme. The British National Committee for Space Research selected experiments from those proposals and submitted them to NASA in 1962. The scientific objectives for the mission were selected in January 1963, and full work on the satellite began in early 1964 due to organisational and financial difficulties. A total of 5 craft were constructed. One prototype, two engineering models, the final satellite and a flight spare. The flight spare was later used as the basis of Ariel 4. =Operation= Power could be drawn from the batteries or the solar panels. The batteries were considered the least reliable component in the system so this method was devised to mitigate the issue. The spacecraft weighed . =Sensors= Ariel 3 carried five experiments. The experiments measured properties of the thermosphere as well as detected \\"terrestrial radio noise\\" from thunderstorms and measured large- scale galactic radio frequency noise. Ariel 3 was also fitted with a series of mirrors to observe the spin of the satellite. High-speed data was transmitted continuously to the Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STADAN). Low-speed data was recorded on tape recorders and was transmitted to ground stations in the high-speed mode when commanded. Three experiments expanded on data from the previous two missions. Two experiments collected data on naturally occurring radio noise. Mission =Launch= The launch was originally planned for Wallops; Ariel 1 and Ariel 2 had both launched on the East coast. In 1964 experimenters requested a change to the proposed orbit, from an inclination of 50–70° to 78–80° to maximize coverage at the geomagnetic latitude. This change precipitated the launch site moving to the West coast. It was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 5 May 1967 aboard a Scout rocket. This made it the first artificial satellite designed and constructed in the United Kingdom. =Operations= Ariel 3 had an orbital period of approximately 95 minutes, with an apogee of 608 km and a perigee of 497 km. It initially spun at 31 rpm for stability, though by the time the Ariel 3 deorbited, it had slowed to a rate of about 1 rpm. On 24 October 1967 the tape recorder aboard Ariel 3 began to malfunction. This restricted observation to real-time operation only. Ariel 3 suffered from a significant power failure in December 1968, restricting the satellite's operation to daylight hours only. The satellite was completely shut down in September 1969. Its orbit decayed steadily until on 14 December 1970 when Ariel 3 re-entered Earth's atmosphere.

History =Background= The Jaina Bhagavati-Sutra of the 5th century AD mentions that Purulia was one of the sixteen mahajanapadas and was a part of the kingdom known as Vajra-bhumi in ancient times. In 1833, the Manbhum district was carved out of the Jungle Mahals district, with headquarters at Manbazar. In 1838, the headquarters was transferred to Purulia. After independence, when Manbhum district was a part of Bihar, efforts were made to impose Hindi on the Bengali-speaking majority of the district and it led to the Bengali Language Movement (Manbhum). In 1956, the Manbhum district was partitioned between Bihar and West Bengal under the States Reorganization Act and the Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act 1956. =Maoist activities= Banduan, along with certain other areas such as Manbazar, Jhalda, and Jaipur, was part of the area affected by the violent activities of Indian Maoists, also referred to as Naxalites. =Red corridor= 106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of the left wing extremism activities, constitutes the Red corridor. In West Bengal the districts of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum are part of the Red corridor. However, as of July 2016, there had been no reported incidents of Maoist related activities from these districts for the previous 4 years. The CPI (Maoist) extremism affected CD blocks in the Purulia district were: Jhalda I, Jhalda II, Arsha, Baghmundi, Balarampur, Barabazar, Manbazar II and Bandwan. Certain reports also included Manbazar I and Joypur CD Blocks and some times indicted the whole of Purulia district. The Lalgarh movement, which started attracting attention after the failed assassination attempt on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, then chief minister of West Bengal, in the Salboni area of the Paschim Medinipur district, on 2 November 2008 and the police action that followed, had also spread over to these areas. The movement was not just a political struggle but an armed struggle that concurrently took the look of a social struggle. A large number of CPI (M) activists were killed. Although the epi-centre of the movement was Lalgarh, it was spread across 19 police stations in three adjoining districts – Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia, all thickly forested and near the border with Jharkhand. The deployment of CRPF and other forces started on 11 June 2009. The movement came to an end after the 2011 state assembly elections and change of government in West Bengal. The death of Kishenji, the Maoist commander, on 24 November 2011 was the last major landmark. Geography CD blocks in Purulia district Bandwan is located at .

He is best known for his memoirs and the oldest surviving notation of Jewish music, both unique survivals. He was born Johannes, son of Dreux, around 1070 in Oppido Lucano, a small town in South Italy. A Catholic priest or a Norman-Italian baronet, he converted to Judaism in 1102.Golb 1965, p. 155 It was common practice for proselytes to choose the name \\"Obadiah\\" because of the tradition that Obadiah the prophet was an Edomite converted to Judaism.\\"Obadiah the Proselyte\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians His reasons are not entirely clear. It is believed he had been inspired by the Jewish people during the First Crusade, as well as the story of Andreas, the archbishop of Bari who had converted to Judaism circa 1066–1078.Golb 1987, pp. 10–11 Obadiah's understanding of the Bible may have also played a role. He is known for recording medieval Jewish chant in Gregorian notation.Golb 1965, pp.153–156 There is a dispute whether this Gregorian melody used is of Jewish origin or of non-Jewish origin.Golb 1967 \\"Obadiah the Norman Proselyte who entered the covenant of the God of Israel in the month of Ellul, year 1413 of Documents which is 4862 of Creation\\"Elul is the 6th month of the Hebrew calendar, corresponding to August–September. \\"4862 of Creation\\" refers to the Anno Mundi system, still used by Jews today, and translates to 1102. So does \\"year 1413 of Documents\\", referring to the \\"era of Documents\\", also known as \\"Alexandrine era\\", system that had been used in Israel since the time of Alexander the Great (see Gold 2004, p. ii, n. 2). \\"he, Obadiah the Proselyte, has written [this prayer-book] with his own hand\\" Obadiah is known to us exclusively through a variety of documents from the Cairo Geniza, all but one in his own hand.Golb 2004 The key piece of evidence for reconstructing his own varied output came from a single colophon leaf, all that remains of a prayer-book, now preserved in the Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati (MS H.U.C. Genizah Collection no. 8). An inscription on the colophon says, in Hebrew, that \\"Obadiah the Norman proselyte\\" who converted to Judaism \\"in the month of Elul\\" of 1102 has written the prayer-book \\"with his own hand\\".Golb 1965, p. 156, n. 9Golb 2004, p. 1 So, although in all of his writings he invariably refers to himself in the third person,Golb 2004, p. 1, n. 2 by directly comparing the handwriting we can be sure that it is indeed he who wrote it. It took scholars over half a century to build a full picture of Obadiah's life and deeds. The name \\"Obadiah the Proselyte\\" first came up in 1901 in the second volume of Ginzei Yerushalayim (, Treaures of Jerusalem), a collection of scientific and literary works from rare manuscripts, compiled by Jerusalem rabbi Solomon Aaron Wertheimer, an amateur scholar and small-time Cairo Geniza material trader.Wertheimer, Solomon Aaron in Jewish EncyclopediaReif 2000, p. 71Golb 2004, p. iFor the Hebrew name, see this auction From a letter of recommendation written for Obadiah by Baruch ben Isaac, the head of a large yeshivah in the city of Aleppo, Syria, Wertheimer published only the more poetic parts, mostly the lament for the plight of the Palestinian Jews in verse from the introduction; from what remained, hardly anything but the names could be deduced: \\"This letter was written in his own hand by our mas[ter Baru]kh ... son of ... [Isaac] ... that it might be kept by Obadiah the Proselyte [for use] in all communities of Israel to which he might go.\\" It took another 30 years for the letter first to make its way into the Bodleian Library (where it remains to this day) and then to attract the attention of Hebrew Union College professor Jacob Mann, who finally published it in its entirety in 1930. All of the Cairo Geniza documents relevant to the life of Johannes of Oppido = Obadiah the Proselyte are available at a website dedicated to his life and writings.

Career  Descended from the Ferrara branch of the Bentivoglio, Jean de Voglie entered the Corps of Bridges and Roads in France in 1742 and was appointed under-engineer to Jean-Rodolphe Perronet at Alençon. He was made inspector-general in 1773. He was placed in charge of construction of the bridge at Tours was given to him on the death of Mathieu Bayeux (born 1723). De Voglie designed and built the bridge at Saumur, though for an unknown reason this bears the name of his collaborator Louis- Alexandre de Cessart. Perronet's designated successor as first engineer and director, de Voglie died prematurely of illness before he could succeed him. The architect François-Michel Lecreulx (1729–1812) (de Voglie's longtime boss at Saumur) said of him that \\"No one possessed a great spirit of conciliation in business than he did; no one was more intelligent in combining under all the faces nor more proper in seizing the convenient moment for his success. He brought together indefatigable activity with a singular facility for its use.\\" De Voglie wrote an article on bridge construction for Denis Diderot's and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, and they also relied on his memory for the volumes on planks.Kafker, Frank A.: Notices sur les auteurs des 17 volumes de « discours » de l'Encyclopédie (suite et fin).

From 1972 until 1976 she served as the 5th President of the Bundestag. She was the first woman to hold this office and the first woman to hold one of the five highest federal offices of the Federal Republic of Germany. She was nominated as the presidential candidate of the SPD in 1979, the first woman to be nominated for President by a major party.  Biography  Annemarie Renger attended the \\"Augusta-Lyzeum\\" in Berlin, an all female high school. Her scholarship was withdrawn and she was forced to leave the institution in 1934 after it was found out that her parents' political attitude did not coincide with that of the ruling Nazi party. Renger instead entered vocational training to become, and worked as, a bookseller and publisher in Berlin. Later she worked as a private secretary for Kurt Schumacher, the leader of the Social Democratic Party. In 1946 she became office manager for the SPD party executive committee in Hannover and later in Bonn. = Family = Annemarie Renger's family was rooted in the social democratic movement. Her grand father was an active party member. Annemarie was one of seven children to Fritz Wildung (1872–1954; a carpenter, SPD politician and sports executive) and his wife Martha (1881–?) who joined the SPD in 1908—the first year women in Germany were eligible to join political parties. In 1924, her father became executive director of the \\"Zentralkommission für Arbeitersport\\" (\\"Central Committee for Workers' Sports\\") in Berlin. The Nazis prohibited him from working and persecuted him. = Life = In 1938, Annemarie Renger married Emil Ernst Renger, an advertising manager, who was killed in 1944 while on military duty in France. Their son, Rolf Renger (1938–1998), later a member of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), whom she survived, did not get to know his father. Annemarie Renger's husband died when she was 26 years old, also having lost three of her brothers to war. In 1945, she met Kurt Schumacher, and became his closest confidant and partner until his death in 1952. In 1965, Annemarie Renger married Aleksandar Loncarevic, an economist from Yugoslavia. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1973. After 1965, the couple lived in Oberwinter near Bonn. = Political career = Renger's association with the SPD continued through the horror of the Nazi regime. After the fall of the Hitler regime she wanted to take use of the newly gained liberty: > “Before us lay the rubble of Germany. I was firmly determined to get myself > involved in politics, and to participate in building a democratic Germany. I > wanted to help ensure that the world would never experience war again.”  Party career  Annemarie Renger became a member of the SPD in 1945. On 1 October, she took up the position of a private secretary to Kurt Schumacher. She later said that since the age of 10, she had wanted to later become a “party secretary”. Upon reading one of his speeches titled “Wir verzweifeln nicht” (“We do not despair”) her attention was called to the Kurt Schumacher, leader of the Social Democratic Party, who had been tortured in the concentration camps by the Nazis. She wanted to meet the author of these lines. The famous photograph showing Annemarie Renger supporting the very ill and amputated (one foot and one arm) Kurt SchumacherPicture showing Renger and Schumacher has become an icon of German post-war history.Eulogy by the President of the Bundestag, Prof. Dr. Norbert Lammert, at the memorial session of the Bundestag honoring the late Annemarie Renger After the 1972 federal election, the SPD held a plurality of seats and thus, with the support of the Free Democrats, on 13 December 1972, was able to elect her as President of the Bundestag. Since 1973, Renger had been a member of the SPD \\"federal party committee\\" as well as the party's chairmanship. From 1979 until 1983, she served in the party's \\"control commission\\". In addition to Egon Franke, Annemarie Renger was considered a leading member of the so-called \\"Kanalarbeiterriege\\" (engl. \\"Sewage Workers Guild\\"), a powerful group of SPD members of the Bundestag in the years 1957 through 1982. Their political orientation was rather conservative and union-friendly. In 1982, the \\"Sewage Workers Guild\\" merged with the Seeheimer Kreis.  Candidacy for the Office of Federal President  In 1979, Annemarie Renger was nominated by her party as a candidate for the Office of the Federal President (Bundespräsident), but lost by a margin of 431 to 528 electoral votes to Karl Carstens, the candidate of the CDU and CSU parties. The 66 electoral delegates seated by the Free Democratic Party (FDP) abstained.  Member of the Bundestag  In 1953, Annemarie Renger won her seat as Member of the Bundestag, and held it through 1990. From 1959 until 1966 she, as well, served as a member of the Advisory Conference of the European Council and the Western European Union. From 1969 until 1972 she served as \\"Parlamentarische Geschäftsführerin\\" (Majority whip) of the SPD. She was the first woman to enter the internal leadership of the SPD parliamentary group (German: “Fraktion”) in the Bundestag. After the SPD, for the first time in German history, had won the majority of seats in the Bundestag in the 1972 federal election, Annemarie Renger on 13 December 1972, was elected President of the Bundestag – the first woman to hold this office in Germany and the first woman in the world holding such office in a freely elected parliament.Eulogy to Annemarie Renger Later Renger said: “I myself proposed my running for this office to the members of our Bundestag parliamentary group. You think, they really had chosen me [for the job, had I not proposed that myself]?“ At the same time she chaired two subcommittees of the \\"Council of Elders of the Bundestag\\": the \\"Subcommittee on Budget\\" and the \\"Subcommitte on Issues of Taxation of Remuneration for Members of the Bundestag\\". She also was chairperson of the \\"Joint Committee\\" (\\"Gemeinsamer Ausschuss nach Artikel 53a des Grundgesetzes\\"). Following the 1976 federal election, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) regained plurality in the Bundestag, and Karl Carstens followed Annemarie Renger as President of the Bundestag. Renger was elected Vice President of the Bundestag and served in this function until her resignation from the Bundestag prior to the 1990 federal election. During her term as Deputy-President, she chaired several committees of the \\"Council of Elders of the Bundestag\\". From 24 June 1977 until 1983, Annemarie Renger served as vice-chairperson of the Bundestag Foreign Relations Committee. During the voting on the SPD motion on the NATO Double-Track Decision (NATO-Doppelbeschluss) held on 22 November 1983,SPD motion concerning the NATO Double-Track Decision of the German Bundestag (german; PDF) which called for additional negotiations with the Soviet Union prior to stationing of Intermediate Range Nuclear Weapons in Europe, she abstained together with 24 party colleagues of the SPD, among them Helmut Schmidt and Egon Franke, Dieter Haak, Karl Ahrens and Hans Matthöfer from the party's right wing.http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/10/10036.pdf Minutes of the 35th session of the Bundestag on 22 November 1983 (german; PDF)  Social dedication  From 1985 on, Annemarie Renger served as President of the “Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland”, a non-profit relief and welfare organisation, which is a member of the European “Samariter International e.V.” (SAINT) . From 1987 until 1998 she was chairwoman of the supervisory board of “McDonald’s Kinderhilfe” (Children Support Fund). From 1991 until 1995 she chaired the „Vereinigung ehemaliger Mitglieder des Deutschen Bundestages und des europäischen Parlaments e. V.“ (Association of Former Members of the German Bundestag and the European Parliament). She was chairwoman of the Central Association of Organisations of Democratic Resistance Fighters and the Persecuted, President of the Kurt Schumacher Society, and Honorary President of \\"Netzwerk Europäische Bewegung Deutschland\\" (Network European Movement)  Awards  Annemarie Renger received various commendations for her special engagement to the German-Jewish-Israeli relationship. Having served as head of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Group for 14 years, in 1992 she was awarded the Buber Rosenzweig Medal, together with Hildegard Hamm-Brücher. She held an honorary doctorate of the Ben-Gurion-University of Negev. In 2006 she received the \\"Heinz-Galinski-Preis\\" (\\"Heinz-Galinski-Award\\") of the Berlin Jewish Community. Annemarie Renger has been awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit, officially: “Verdienstorden der Bundesrepublik Deutschland”, “Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany”).  Trivia  Annemarie Renger is commonly regarded as a \\"Grande Dame\\", the last of the grand ladies of the German Social Democratic movement. This is owed not only to her political influence, her life in a social democratic community, or to her age, but also to her demeanor. Renger set great value on style and appearance. She had a preference for sports cars and mink coats and her hair styling was always perfect. There are legendary anecdotes about her friendly, but resolute remark to Gerhard Schröder, then (1980) newly elected Member of the Bundestag and Chairman of the SPD “Juso\\" (abbreviation for \\"Young Socialists\\") youth organisation (and later to become Federal Chancellor) about him failing to wear a necktie: „Genosse [(comrade)] Schröder, you will have to wear a necktie for tomorrow's election of the Bundeskanzler – as called for by custom\\". Schröder followed her order and, at a later occasion, remarked: 'For her, wearing proper attire was a sign of respect towards a constitutional body of democratic Germany. The institutions of parliamentary democracy had to be respected. For Annemarie Renger, they were emitting grace of their own, and this was not to be violated.'Speech by former Chancellor, Dr. Gerhard Schröder during the eulogy session of the Bundestag in honor of the late Annemarie Renger on 13 March 2008 (german)  Quotes   Literature  * Sozialdemokratie und Parlament. in: Beiträge zu Einzelproblemen des „Entwurfs eines ökonomisch-politischen Orientierungsrahmens für die Jahre 1973–1985“.

DKW F9 prototype rear view The small DKWs were among top selling small cars in Germany in the 1930s, and regular model updates were part of the company's strategy for maintaining commercial success in this growing market sector. With its all steel body designed by Guenther Mickwausch the F9 would have represented a significantly greater step forward than the F8 had done: it appears that the F9 was already under development in 1937, two years before launch of its F8 predecessor. Several prototypes were built during the 1939-1942 period. A Cd factor of 0.42 was claimed for the new design and the look of the car was significantly smoother than the 1930s DKW designs. For the first time, a three cylinder engine was specified, implying useful performance advantages. In other respects, DKW traditions were respected. The engine was still a two stroke unit, and the driven wheels were still the front wheels. The chassis was still of box frame construction. Had the war not intervened it is believed that the F9 would have replaced the F8 in 1940. In the event, production of the F8 Meisterklasse was prolonged until 1942 when passenger car production at Zwickau came to an end. However, after the war the car reappeared as the IFA F9 and was offered for sale by the Zwickau plant's new controllers between 1949 and 1956. In the west of Germany Auto Union's successor company started off with two cylinder products that in many ways owed more to the old F8 than to the F9, but with the introduction in 1953 of the DKW F91 the western business, too, offered its own development of this innovative pre-war prototype.

As at the battle of Thouars, the Republican prisoners were released after swearing not to fight again in the Vendée and having had their hair shaved off so they could be recognised lest they went back on their word and were recaptured. In the prison at Saumur, the Vendéens found general Pierre Quétineau who had been taken prisoner after his defeat at Thouars. General Lescure, knowing that his defeated opponent was under threat of a sentence of death from the revolutionary court, proposed to the republican general to remain among the royalists but not have to fight for them. Pierre Quétineau refused out of conviction, realising that even if he was safe the revolutionary court could instead punish his family if he was seen to be siding with the counter-revolutionaries, and returned to republican territory.

The winery is located in the Right Bank of France's Bordeaux wine region in the commune of Saint-Émilion, in the department Gironde. The estate also produces the second wine Croix de Beauséjour. History Château Beauséjour was once a vineyard cultivated by the monks of the Church of St-Martin during the Middle Ages. It was acquired by the Gerès family in the 17th century, the land then named Peycoucou. By marriage the estate came to the de Carle family, seigneurs of Figeac, and in 1787 General Jacques de Carle renamed the property to Beauséjour. When the historic estate in its entirety came to Pierre-Paulin Ducarpe, it was divided in 1869 between his two children. The son inherited the half which was sold in 1924 to Dr. Fagouet, altering the name to Château Beauséjour-Dr-Fagouet (present day Château Beau-Séjour Bécot) and his daughter who wed Doctor Duffau-Lagarrosse, received what became Château Beauséjour- Duffau-Lagarrosse. The estate was set up as a non-trading company (société civile) in 1963, and remains owned by the Duffau-Lagarrosse family. Nicolas Thienpont, director of winemaking at Château Pavie Macquin, is in overall charge of a 2009 effort to raise the estate's potential, assisted by consultant oenologists Michel Rolland and Stéphane Derenoncourt.

They were also known as the \\"Red Army\\" on account of their emblem: the Sacred Heart. Catholic and Royal Army of Vendée The Catholic and Royal Army of Vendée was composed of the three Vendéen armies although that of Lower Poitou joined only occasionally. During the year 1793, the Vendéen army was distinguished into sub-armies : the army of Charette in the Marais breton, the Catholic and Royal Army of Anjou and of Haut-Poitou, and that of Bas-Poitou and Retz country, south of the Loire. The Chouans of the north of the Loire who joined the Vendéens during the Virée de Galerne were named Catholic and Royal Army of Bas-Anjou and of Haute-Bretagne. In reality, those armies were simply groups of fluctuating insurgents led by a chief who had authority over people following his beliefs. The only units with a quasi-permanent existence and organization are the \\"compagnies de paroisse\\" which grouped together members of the rural community who elected their captains. Although two-thirds of the insurgents were peasants, they only represented half of the men in these units, the rest being artisans and shopkeepers. The flaws of this army were its few health services and its lack of permanent fighters, even considering their reinforcements of republican deserters, gabelous, Germans or Swiss. Their weaponry and provisions were also poor. The cavalry was only composed of noble chiefs, a few game wardens and peasants mounted on farm horses. The artillery was composed only of old culverin taken from castles and a few cannons taken from the republicans, making it impossible for the Catholic and Royal Army to oppose a strong Republican army on open field, or to break the fortifications of a town like at Granville. After the Battle of Savenay, the army was reconstructed on paper but its actual existence was insignificant; the insurrection became a chouannerie. =Peasant soldiers= The royalist insurgents who take the name of Vendéens, and that the Republicans named Brigands, originated from four departments, southern Maine-et-Loire, northern Vendée, northern Deux-Sèvres, et southern Loire-Atlantique in the provinces of Poitou, Anjou and Brittany. The insurgent territory took the name of military Vendée. The great majority of Vendéen insurgents were peasants, armed with scythes if they didn't have rifles, but there were also a great number of artisans, especially in the Mauges region of Anjou. The mobilisation in the insurgent territories was massive. In Chemillé, the age of the insurgents varied from 11 to 67 years old. The average age was 25 to 30 years old. A few women also fought among the Vendéens; the most famous one was Renée Bordereau. The army of Charette was known to have a few amazons in its ranks, including Céleste Bulkeley. It was only during the Virée de Galerne that the officers started adopting signs to distinguish themselves from the troops. The generals and officers of the counsel took white scarves worn at the belt with knots of different colors. La Rochejaquelein and Donnissan wore a black knot, Stofflet a red one, and Marigny a blue one. Officers of a lower rank started wearing a white scarf attached to their left arm. Priests who opposed the revolution didn't have a direct role in the war, a few held a seat in the royalist counsels and mainly took care of correspondences. Priests serving as officers or physically participating in combats was generally not well considered by Vendéens. =Regular army= A few regular troops were formed in the army of Vendée, where they served as elite troops. Charles de Bonchamps organized infantry and cavalry units whom he equipped with his own means. These troops were even given uniforms, grey for the infantry, green for the cavalry. Nonetheless, the Vendéens didn't like leaving their homes for too long, so after a few days of combat they would leave the army and go back to their villages. Hence the Vendéens were incapable of keeping conquered towns like Angers, Saumur, Thouars and Fontenay-le-Comte, which were progressively abandoned and retaken by the republicans without difficulty. To fix this disadvantage, regular troops were recruited among republican deserters and insurgents exterior to Vendée, especially Angevins from northern Maine-et-Loire and Bretons from the [Loire-Atlantique]. A few future Chouan officers served in this troops, including Georges Cadoudal, Pierre-Mathurin Mercier, Scépeaux, Jean Terrien, Joseph-Juste Coquereau and Louis Courtillé. Regular cen troops also included a high number of foreigners, including Russians, Germans and many Jews (according to republican Jacques Léonard Laplanche's writings). Among the foreign soldiers who joined the Vendéens are included the Germans of the La Marck regiment and of the Germanic Legion, as well as a battalion of 600 Swiss and Germans commanded by the baron of Keller, of which some were former Swiss Guards. =Generals of the Vendée= File:Cathelineau.jpg|Jacques Cathelineau File:Maurice d'Elbée.jpg|Maurice Gigost d'Elbée File:Bonchamps.jpg|Charles de Bonchamps File:François-Athanase de Charette de La Contrie.jpg|François- Athanase Charette de La Contrie File:Pierre-Narcisse Guérin Henri de la Rochejaquelin.jpeg|Henri de La Rochejaquelein File:Louis de Lescure1.jpg|Louis Marie de Lescure File:JeanNicolasStofflet.jpg|Jean-Nicolas Stofflet File:Antoine Philippe de La Trémoille, Prince of Talmont by Léon Cogniet (Musée d'art et d'histoire de Cholet).jpg|Antoine-Philippe de La Trémoïlle, Prince de Talmont File:Charles Sapinaud de La Rairie.jpg|Charles Sapinaud de La Rairie Other leaders include: Jacques Nicolas Fleuriot de La Fleuriais and Charles Aimé de Royrand. Catholic and Royal Army of Brittany From the Breton association of La Rouërie, this army was created by Joseph de Puisaye to unify the different chouans divisions. On 15 October 1794, Puisaye was named Lieutenant General of the army of Brittany by the Count Charles of Artois, future king Charles X of France. Following the failure of the Quiberon expedition in July 1795, Puisaye's commandment was questioned, and the army was broken into factions, especially with the army of Morbihan commanded by Cadoudal who didn't recognize the authority of the Lieutenant General. Other factions were the army of the Côtes du Nord, and the army of Maine, Anjou and of Haute-Bretagne. Puisaye was only recognized by the army of Rennes and Fougères, although he still gathered support from the princes. Finally, Puisaye resigned in 1798. After René Augustin de Chalus commanded for a short while, then the Count of Artois chose Marigny to succeed him but he refused. The commandment went to Béhague who only stayed a few months in Brittany during the year 1798 and headed back to England. In the end, it was Georges Cadoudal, named Major General of Béhague, who led the command of the army. Dead in 1804, Cadoudal was named Marshal of France after his death. Catholic and Royal Army of Normandy The Catholic and Royal Army of Normandy, sometimes simply named Royal Army of Normandy because it hosted a few Protestants in its ranks, was an army of Chouans commanded by Louis de Frotté. In Normandy, its territory was limited to the Orne and southern Manche, and in Maine only a few zones in northern Mayenne.

Battle To defend the city, the Republicans had been posted on the bridges of the River Thouet in front of the city. The main clash took place on the pont de Vrine. The Vendéens proved unable to take the bridge for six hours, until Louis Marie de Lescure (fighting in his first battle) showed himself alone on the bridge under enemy fire and encouraged his men to follow him, which they did, crossing the bridge. The Republicans there were taken from behind by the cavalry under Charles de Bonchamps, which had crossed the river at a ford. Despite the arrival of reinforcements, the Republicans were turned to rout and withdrew towards the city. The Whites, headed by Henri de La Rochejacquelein, took the rampart by force and poured into the city, and the Republican troops quickly capitulated.

Early life Dov Yermiya was born on moshav Beit Gan, now a part of Yavne'el, in what was then Ottoman Palestine in 1914. His parents, David and Bella Yirmanovich, had immigrated to Palestine from the Russian Empire as part of the Second Aliyah. His mother had been romantically involved with Joseph Trumpeldor before marrying his father.Yermiya, Dov: My War Diary: Lebanon, June 5 - July 1, 1982 In 1921, his family moved to moshav Nahalal, where he grew up. Moshe Dayan was a childhood friend of his. In school, he displayed musical talent, and at age 15, he conducted a student's choir and composed melodies.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.701804 As a teenager, Yermiya joined the Haganah in 1929, and defended Nahalal during the 1929 Palestine riots. In 1934, he left Nahalal to study music in Tel Aviv. While studying music, he joined Hashomer Hatzair. In 1937, his parents separated, although they never divorced, with his father moving to kibbutz Beit Alfa and his mother moving to Hadera. He maintained a close relationship with each of them until their deaths. During the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Yermiya joined the Special Night Squads. In 1938, he was among the founders of kibbutz Eilon, and became a member of the kibbutz. He participated in a battle for kibbutz Hanita, and was appointed regional commander of the area. After World War II, broke out, Yermiya joined the British Army, and served in Palestinian Transport Corps. He participated in the North African and Middle Eastern fronts, and the invasions of Italy and Germany. At the end of the war, he was a member of the Haganah's elite strike unit, the Palmach, and participated in Palmach operations to smuggle illegal Jewish immigrants into Palestine as part of Aliyah Bet. Israeli military career During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Yermiya served in the Israel Defense Forces as a company commander. He participated in fighting in the Eastern and Western Galilee, and the conquest of Nazareth. He was the officer who directed the assault that ended in the conquest of Saffuriyah in Operation Dekel, and his memory of the event confirms the version of events given by the Palestinians who fled.Haim Bresheeth, 'The Continuity of Trauma and Struggle: Recent Cinematic Representations of the Nakba,' in Ahmad H. Sa'di, Lila Abu-Lughod, (eds.) Nakba: Palestine, 1948, and the claims of memory, Columbia University Press, 2007, pp.160-189, p.170. He was a deputy battalion commander in the Carmeli Brigade during Operation Hiram, which saw Israel capture the Upper Galilee and invade southern Lebanon, which was temporarily occupied by the Israelis. During the occupation of southern Lebanon, an officer under Yermiya's command, First Lieutenant Shmuel Lahis, was one of the two Israeli officers responsible for the Hula massacre, in which dozens of people in the village of Hula were killed. When Yermiya learned of this, he filed a complaint that led to the two officers' trial and conviction in a military court. After the war, Yermiya continued to serve in the army, eventually reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. His second wife, Hadassah Mor, whom he married during this time, claimed he had developed Communist views, and wrote that \\"Stalin... was Dov's God.\\" In 1958, he retired from the army. Civilian life After retiring from his military career, Yermiya became a member of kibbutz Sarid, where he worked in agriculture and as a Hebrew teacher for new immigrants. Later, he left Sarid and settled in Nahariya, where he lived for most of his life before returning to Eilon in his final years. He was active in struggling for equal rights for Israeli-Arabs. In particular, he protested the imposition of military rule over Arab areas, which was in effect until 1966, and turned down an appointment that would have made him Military Governor of Nazareth.Hatim Kanaaneh, 'In Memory of Dov Yermiya,' Mondoweiss February 13, 2016. He was one of the founding members of the Nature and Parks Authority in the Northern District, which later became part of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. He worked there until his retirement in 1979. After his retirement, he became the security coordinator for the Ga'aton Regional Council. Reserve military and police service In 1967, General David Elazar, who commanded the IDF's Northern Command, appointed Yermiya commander of the regional defense of Kiryat Shmona, and from then on, he did reserve duty on a voluntary basis. In 1974, one day after the Ma'alot massacre, he established the Civil Guard in Nahariya and served as its commander. Five weeks later, he participated in action against Palestinian infiltrators during the 1974 Nahariya attack.http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=PHoDGqijWy05I6E9ouxJNasbWzpjWAlVUaa%2BRNTdsEZGKnroBQClYnDC8QlC0qIyYw%3D%3D&mode;=image&href;=MAR%2f1974%2f06%2f25&page;=11&rtl;=true In 1976, when the Good Fence opened, he served as a reservist in the military government unit. During the 1978 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, he served as an administrative and service officer in the military government unit, which became a unit dealing with assistance for civilians. =1982 Lebanon War= During the 1982 Lebanon War, Yermiya, aged 68, volunteered for service. He served in the civilian assistance unit, and was shocked by what he witnessed. In his diary account of the battle to capture the refugee camp of Ain al- Hilweh, one of the fiercest battles of the war, he wrote that the aerial and artillery assault on the camp reminded him of World War II.James Ron,Frontiers and ghettos: state violence in Serbia and Israel, University of California Press, 2003, p.178.Diane Chebab, 'Echoes of the Past in the Palestinian/Israeli Conflict,' in Social justice: A Journal of Crime, Conflict & World Order, Social Justice, 1990 Vol.17, No.1, p.53. He called the war a mistake, and wrote \\"we've become a nation of savage thugs.\\" He published his war diary in a newspaper. As a result of his public criticisms of the war, he was dismissed from the army. His commanding officer wrote that his words could have been written by a PLO propagandist.Asher Kaufman, ‘Forgetting the Lebanese War?

The following year he became famous for when he released his war diary as a book, My War Diary: Lebanon June 5 -- July 1, 1982. Published in defiance of censorship laws, it provoked, according to the publishers, 'widespread controversy when it was first published in Israel', but was ignored by Western media.Noam Chomsky, Pirates and emperors, old and new: international terrorism in the real world, South End Press, 2002 p.189 n.24. The book criticized Israeli actions during the war, and was first published in Hebrew with the title \\"Yoman Hamilchama Sheli\\" (My War Diary). It was later translated to English and published by South End Press. The book has been given some attention by Western intellectuals, such as the US writer Noam Chomsky. In 1983, Yermiya was the recipient of a Human Rights Award from the Association for Civil Rights for his work in relieving the suffering of Lebanese civilians during hostilities. Later activism After his dismissal from the army, Yermiya continued to assist Palestinian refugees in Lebanon as a private citizen. According to Edward Alexander, in a chapter surveying what he calls 'Antisemitism, Israeli-style,' Yermiya is said to have made a profession of giving speeches around the world that draw on an analogy between Israel and Nazi Germany, and to have affirmed in an interview that he and his friends thought as early as 1945 that the Holocaust would \\"affect Jews in Israel ... for the bad.\\"Edward Alexander, The Jewish wars: reflections by one of the belligerents, SIU Press 1996, p.35. In 1986, he met PLO officials in Romania, at a time when associating with the PLO was a criminal offense. When the First Intifada broke out, he urged Israeli soldiers to refuse to serve in the Palestinian territories, and was arrested on suspicion of incitement. Final years and death In the last years of his life, Yermiya expressed his opinion that Zionism was a failure, and that the State of Israel was ultimately doomed. In July 2009, he wrote to friends expressing his despair at the situation in Israel and Palestine, and concluding In a 2011 interview for The Last Zionist, a film about his life, he stated “I’ve lived under three regimes in this country: four years with the Turks, 30 years with the British and now with Israel…I see no future for my offspring in this country. We’re heading for ruin and destruction. I think the state won’t exist in 50-100 years.” Yermiya died on 30 January 2016, at his home on Kibbutz Eilon. Personal life Yermiya had two daughters, Roni and Avigail, with his first wife, Gronia. In the 1950s, while commanding a training base for new recruits, he met his second wife, Hadassah Mor, who was 16 years his junior. She had come to the base to be a teacher to new recruits, but Yermiya chose her to be his secretary. A romantic relationship developed, and Yermiya divorced Gronia to marry her. In 1956, their son Raz was born. Yermiya introduced Mor to his friend, Moshe Dayan, and divorced her when he found out that she and Dayan were having an affair. Enraged by the affair, he wrote an angry letter to Dayan, and tried to block Dayan's career advancement. He later married his third wife, Menuha. At the time of his death, he had 12 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

This may take place under elevated temperatures and nitrogen atmosphere. Possible uses for electron irradiation include sterilization and cross-linking of polymers. Electron energies typically vary from the keV to MeV range, depending on the depth of penetration required. The irradiation dose is usually measured in grays but also in Mrads ( is equivalent to ). The basic components of a typical electron-beam processing device are illustrated in the figure. An electron gun (consisting of a cathode, grid, and anode) is used to generate and accelerate the primary beam. A magnetic optical (focusing and deflection) system is used for controlling the way in which the electron beam impinges on the material being processed (the \\"workpiece\\"). In operation, the gun cathode is the source of thermally emitted electrons that are both accelerated and shaped into a collimated beam by the electrostatic field geometry established by the gun electrode (grid and anode) configuration used. The electron beam then emerges from the gun assembly through an exit hole in the ground-plane anode with an energy equal to the value of the negative high voltage (gun operating voltage) being applied to the cathode. This use of a direct high voltage to produce a high- energy electron beam allows the conversion of input electrical power to beam power at greater than 95% efficiency, making electron-beam material processing a highly energy-efficient technique. After exiting the gun, the beam passes through an electromagnetic lens and deflection coil system. The lens is used for producing either a focused or defocused beam spot on the workpiece, while the deflection coil is used to either position the beam spot on a stationary location or provide some form of oscillatory motion. In polymers, an electron beam may be used on the material to induce effects such as chain scission (which makes the polymer chain shorter) and cross-linking. The result is a change in the properties of the polymer, which is intended to extend the range of applications for the material. The effects of irradiation may also include changes in crystallinity, as well as microstructure. Usually, the irradiation process degrades the polymer. The irradiated polymers may sometimes be characterized using DSC, XRD, FTIR, or SEM. In poly(vinylidene fluoride- trifluoroethylene) copolymers, high-energy electron irradiation lowers the energy barrier for the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition and reduces polarization hysteresis losses in the material. Electron-beam processing involves irradiation (treatment) of products using a high-energy electron-beam accelerator. Electron-beam accelerators utilize an on-off technology, with a common design being similar to that of a cathode ray television. Electron-beam processing is used in industry primarily for three product modifications: * Crosslinking of polymer-based products to improve mechanical, thermal, chemical and other properties, * Material degradation often used in the recycling of materials, * Sterilization of medical and pharmaceutical goods.Bly, J. H.; Electron Beam Processing. Yardley, PA: International Information Associates, 1988. Nanotechnology is one of the fastest-growing new areas in science and engineering. Radiation is early applied tool in this area; arrangement of atoms and ions has been performed using ion or electron beams for many years. New applications concern nanocluster and nanocomposites synthesis.  Crosslinking  The cross-linking of polymers through electron- beam processing changes a thermoplastic material into a thermoset. When polymers are crosslinked, the molecular movement is severely impeded, making the polymer stable against heat. This locking together of molecules is the origin of all of the benefits of crosslinking, including the improvement of the following properties: * Thermal: resistance to temperature, aging, low- temperature impact, etc. * Mechanical: tensile strength, modulus, abrasion resistance, pressure rating, creep resistance, etc. * Chemical: stress crack resistance, etc. * Other: heat shrink memory properties, positive temperature coefficient, etc. Cross-linking is the interconnection of adjacent long molecules with networks of bonds induced by chemical treatment or electron- beam treatment. Electron-beam processing of thermoplastic material results in an array of enhancements, such as an increase in tensile strength and resistance to abrasions, stress cracking and solvents. Joint replacements such as knees and hips are being manufactured from cross-linked ultra-high- molecular-weight polyethylene because of the excellent wear characteristics due to extensive research.http://www.massgeneral.org/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1018 Polymers commonly crosslinked using the electron-beam irradiation process include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic polyurethanes and elastomers (TPUs), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyamides / nylon (PA66, PA6, PA11, PA12), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polymethylpentene (PMP), polyethylenes (LLDPE, LDPE, MDPE, HDPE, UHMWPE), and ethylene copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE). Some of the polymers utilize additives to make the polymer more readily irradiation-crosslinkable. An example of an electron-beam crosslinked part is connector made from polyamide, designed to withstand the higher temperatures needed for soldering with the lead-free solder required by the RoHS initiative. Cross-linked polyethylene piping called PEX is commonly used as an alternative to copper piping for water lines in newer home construction. PEX piping will outlast copper and has performance characteristics that are superior to copper in many ways. Foam is also produced using electron-beam processing to produce high- quality, fine-celled, aesthetically pleasing product.  Long-chain branching  The resin pellets used to produce the foam and thermoformed parts can be electron-beam-processed to a lower dose level than when crosslinking and gels occur. These resin pellets, such as polypropylene and polyethylene can be used to create lower-density foams and other parts, as the \\"melt strength\\" of the polymer is increased.http://www.ebeamservices.com/pdf/E-BEAM-Foam- Applications.pdf  Chain scissioning  Chain scissioning or polymer degradation can also be achieved through electron-beam processing. The effect of the electron beam can cause the degradation of polymers, breaking chains and therefore reducing the molecular weight. The chain scissioning effects observed in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) have been used to create fine micropowders from scrap or off-grade materials. Chain scission is the breaking apart of molecular chains to produce required molecular sub-units from the chain. Electron-beam processing provides Chain scission without the use of harsh chemicals usually utilized to initiate chain scission. An example of this process is the breaking down of cellulose fibers extracted from wood in order to shorten the molecules, thereby producing a raw material that can then be used to produce biodegradable detergents and diet-food substitutes. \\"Teflon\\" (PTFE) is also electron-beam-processed, allowing it to be ground to a fine powder for use in inks and as coatings for the automotive industry.  Microbiological sterilization  Electron-beam processing has the ability to break the chains of DNA in living organisms, such as bacteria, resulting in microbial death and rendering the space they inhabit sterile. E-beam processing has been used for the sterilization of medical products and aseptic packaging materials for foods, as well as disinfestation, the elimination of live insects from grain, tobacco, and other unprocessed bulk crops.Singh, A., Silverman, J., eds. Radiation Processing of Polymers. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1992. Sterilization with electrons has significant advantages over other methods of sterilization currently in use. The process is quick, reliable, and compatible with most materials, and does not require any quarantine following the processing. For some materials and products that are sensitive to oxidative effects, radiation tolerance levels for electron- beam irradiation may be slightly higher than for gamma exposure. This is due to the higher dose rates and shorter exposure times of e-beam irradiation, which have been shown to reduce the degradative effects of oxygen.

Owned by Border International Broadcasting and operated by Rogers Radio, a division of Canadian broadcaster Rogers Media, it broadcasts a CHR/Top 40 format branded as Kiss 102.7. Although officially licensed to a community in the United States, the station primarily targets the larger neighboring Canadian market of Kingston, Ontario (where Rogers owns CKXC-FM and CIKR-FM), and is a member of Nielsen BDS' Canadian Border Stations Airplay panel in Watertown.  History  WLYK signed on January 23, 1989, as WKGG, a repeater for WTOJ in Watertown, but with a Kingston focus. In late 1993, the station went silent. In 1997, Garry MC Colman returned the station to air with a CHR format as \\"The Border\\". In late 1997, 102.7 started simulcasting on 106.7 FM to better serve Watertown. After the split of the \\"Border\\" simulcast in August 2006, it flipped to country music as KIX-FM after Kingston station CFMK-FM changed formats from country to adult hits, with 106.7 continuing the \\"Border\\" format. In December 2007, WBDR began stunting with all-Christmas music. This lasted until January 2, 2008, when the station switched to adult standards. The \\"Kix\\" country music format moved to CKXC-FM at the same time. On February 26, 2008, WBDR changed their call letters to WLYK. In September 2012, WLYK flipped to adult contemporary, maintaining its prior branding as The Lake. On September 12, 2013, WLYK flipped to a contemporary hit radio format branded as Kiss 102.7, using the standard Kiss branding used by most of Rogers' CHR outlets. The station also has a rebroadcaster at 103.3 FM, but it is unknown when it was launched. Ownership and management Ownership of Border International Broadcasting is currently divided between four shareholders: U.S. citizens John Clancy and David Mance (34% each), Rogers Broadcasting (20%), and Craig Harris (12%). Harris also resides in the U.S. but currently lists his citizenship as Canadian. In 2004, 20% of Border International Broadcasting was acquired by a Kingston-based numbered company. The same company also secured a local marketing agreement to operate the station, which led to WLYK sharing operations with Kingston stations CIKR-FM and (later) CKXC-FM. In late November 2008, Rogers Broadcasting announced it would acquire the remainder of K-Rock 105.7 Inc., owners of CIKR and CKXC, of which it already owned 25%, pending CRTC approval;Rogers press release, November 28, 2008 the transaction was completed the following May. Following the transaction, WLYK's website was not updated to follow the standard Rogers radio station template and referred to its operator as simply \\"The Radio Group\\"; however it did continue to feature the logos of CIKR and CKXC, and continued to list the same studio address as the Rogers stations. Rogers ultimately also acquired the Kingston company's interest in the station in February 2011. WLYK's website has since been updated to indicate Rogers's current management of the station.

Birth and childhood Anna Bronson Alcott was born in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia on March 16, 1831. She was the first of four daughters born to Amos Bronson Alcott and Abby May. She was named after both her paternal grandmother (Anna) and her father (Bronson). Amos Bronson Alcott was a schoolteacher and from the time Anna was born, he took detailed notes on his daughter's development. Anna was primarily educated at home although she attended her father's Temple School in the late 1830s. From an early age, Anna was \\"stage-struck\\" and secretly longed \\"to shine before the world as a great actress or prima donna.\\" In her youth, she and her sister Louisa created romantic melodramas which they performed for friends. While Louisa was known among friends for her comedic acting, Anna \\"could cause handkerchiefs to come out and much swallowing of lumps in the throat.\\" Between 1847 and 1849, Anna and Louisa coauthored a tragedy entitled Norna; or, The Witch's Curse. It was published after Louisa's death in Comic Tragedies (1893) which featured an introduction by Anna titled \\"A forward from Meg.\\" In 1850, Anna opened a small school in Boston with approximately 20 pupils. In 1853, she accepted a teaching position in Syracuse, New York. Marriage and children List of wedding gifts given to Anna Alcott and John Bridge PrattIn 1858, the year they moved to Orchard House in Concord, Louisa and Anna helped form the Concord Dramatic Union. Another member of the group was John Bridge Pratt. He and Anna fell in love while playing opposite each other in a play called \\"The Loan of a Lover.\\" The couple announced their engagement in spring 1858 and married at Orchard House in May 1860. Their wedding provided the basis for the fictional marriage of Meg and John in Little Women. Anna wore a grey silk dress to the wedding. Guests included Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Lidian Jackson Emerson and Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. Anna and John had two sons: Frederick Alcott Pratt (1863-1910) and John Sewall Pratt (1865-1923). John Sewall Pratt later changed his name to John Alcott \\"in deference to Louisa [May] Alcott's will.\\" Both worked in book publishing.

After her husband's death Anna purchased the Thoreau-Alcott House on Main Street in Concord in 1877 with help from her sister Louisa. Anna had $2500 in savings and the asking price for the house was $5,000. Louisa offered $4500 which was accepted.

The primary work site is the Carrie Bow Marine Field Station, a research station at Carrie Bow Cay () on the Meso-American Barrier Reef in Belize. The program is an extended duration study of coral reefs, mangroves, sea grass meadows, and the sandy bottoms.Ruetzler, K. (2008).

Research over the years The site grew quickly and within ten years, 65 scientists and graduate students worked at the station, and more than 100 research papers were published on the fauna, flora, and geology of the reef. To date, there have been over 500 publications based on research done at the station.Unesco – Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, by Karen H. Koltes, John J. Tschirky, and Ilka C. Feller History =Early years= In 1972 the Carrie Bow Cay location was chosen for its rampant growth, its secluded location, its size and its distance from research centers on land. Between 1972-1975 there were very few resources and equipment when the program was getting started. The program's initial objectives were to make maps of the area and where near reefs were as well as to identify key species in the ecosystem. =Next Step= In 1975 a grant from Exxon Corporation was awarded, which doubled the funding of the CCRE program. Aerial photographs of the reef were also taken allowing for highly detailed mapping of the area. In 1978 hurricane Greta passed across the Belize Barrier Reef Smithsonian Institution. (2011). 2011 CCRE annual report. Fort Pierce, FL: Smithsonian Institution and caused severe damage to the equipment and buildings of the Carrie Bow station and the reef. Even with this setback the team published their findings. The book is known as the Blue Book, which became the stepping off for their future investigations, and further funding. =1980s= In the 1980s, the team turned some of their attention to the highly bio-diverse mangrove swamps, just north-west of the Carrie Bow. Because the mangroves are both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, the team was able to diversify their research and start terrestrial studies. In 1985, the National Museum of Natural History received money from the US Congress to study the Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystem (CCRE); this would become the new name of the research initiative. =1990s= In 1997, as many projects were coming to an end, a fire left the station little more than rubble and ashes. =21st Century= The reef has been struck by a number of hurricanes, causing substantial damage and erosion to the beaches and CCRE facilities. The damages caused have led to many infrastructure changes and improvements to the facilities. Most recently, Valerie Paul took over as the CCRE Director.

The large Grunewald forest with the Teufelsberg hill is located nearby in the south. History The station opened on 1 November 1909, where the new Spandau suburban railway (Westbahn) branched off the western continuation of the Berlin Stadtbahn line at Westkreuz station to reach the Berlin–Lehrte and Berlin–Hamburg railways at Spandau. While the line served to develop the Westend mansions' colony, the first section to Rennbahn station (today: Olympiastadion) was built to reach the Rennbahn Grunewald - later rebuilt as Deutsches Stadion due to host the 1916 Summer Olympics that never took place. The broad Heerstraße road was laid out a few years before and was regularly used as a parade route by the passing Guards Corps of the Imperial German Army. The station became part of the electrified S-Bahn commuter rail network in August 1928. KdF City with Heerstraße station (upper right), Due to its direct connection to the city centre the station had occasionally been the site of official receptions: On 11 May 1925 the newly elected Reich President Paul von Hindenburg arrived here from Hanover, received by Chancellor Hans Luther, to take office the next day. After the Nazi seizure of power, the Heerstraße road became part of the monumental \\"East-West-Axis\\" avenue according to the Welthauptstadt Germania renewal plans. Both the street and the railway line were important transport links to the 1936 Summer Olympics at the Olympiastadion and the Olympic Village in Elstal. A \\"Strength Through Joy\\" (KdF) City was laid out on the Messe fairground east of the station to receive and accommodate numerous visitors. One year later, on 27 September 1937, Adolf Hitler received the Italian Duce Benito Mussolini at the station and carried him in a triumphal procession to the Reich Chancellery. Plans drafted in 1938 to rebuilt the entrance hall in a lavish Nazi neoclassical style as Mussolini-Bahnhof were never carried out. On 4 July 1944 resistance fighter Adolf Reichwein, on his way to a conspirative meeting with Communist Party leaders to prepare for the 20 July plot, was betrayed and arrested by Gestapo henchmen at Heerstraße station. Severely damaged in World War II, the entrance hall in 1959 was rebuilt in a simplified style. In 1980 train services by the Deutsche Reichsbahn discontinued and were not resumed until after German reunification. The adjacent Heerstraße Bridge across the tracks was rebuilt from 1994 to 1996. Largely restored, the station was re-opened on 16 January 1998.

A person may have, at one level certain beliefs or a lack of knowledge, or uncertainty, about the options and their actual likelihoods. However, when it is necessary to make a decision (such as deciding whether to place a bet), the behaviour of the rational person would suggest that the person has assigned a set of regular probabilities to the options. These are the pignistic probabilities. The term was coined by Philippe Smets,Smets, P., \\"Data Fusion in the Transferable Belief Model\\" , Proc. 3rd Intl. Conf. Information Fusion, Paris, France (2000) pp. 21–33. and stems from the Latin pignus, a bet. He contrasts the pignistic level, where one might take action, with the credal level, where one interprets the state of the world: :The transferable belief model is based on the assumption that beliefs manifest themselves at two mental levels: the ‘credal’ level where beliefs are entertained and the ‘pignistic’ level where beliefs are used to make decisions (from ‘credo’ I believe and ‘pignus’ a bet, both in Latin). Usually these two levels are not distinguished and probability functions are used to quantify beliefs at both levels. The justification for the use of probability functions is usually linked to “rational” behavior to be held by an ideal agent involved in some decision contexts.

It was published in 1956 by Gnome Press in an edition of 5,000 copies. The book is the second volume of the author's Solar Queen series. Plot summary The main protagonist of the novel is Dane Thorson, Cargo-master-apprentice on the Free Trader rocket ship the Solar Queen. Free Traders take on trading contracts on remote and recently discovered planets, which can be dangerous and unpredictable. The Solar Queen has recently obtained a valuable trading contract on the planet Sargol and are building a relationship with one of the races on the planet, the cat-like Salariki. The process goes slowly till the Salariki discover that the Solar Queen is carrying catnip and other plants from Terra that are unknown on Sargol. The traders exchange what little of the plants they have for the rare and valuable Koros stones and collect a native red-colored wood to exchange at home. At the last minute the storm priests of the Salariki demand that the Solar Queen take a pre-paid contract to return within 6 months with more plants. A few days after leaving the planet, several members of the crew suffer from attacks, which start with severe headaches and end in a semi-coma state. Only 4 of the younger members of the crew are unaffected, including Dane Thorson. Upon exiting hyperspace on return to the vicinity of Terra, the crew discovers that they are pariah and have been declared a plague ship. On the short hop to earth, the crew discovers that pests have invaded the ship and are the cause of the illness. In a final bid to prove their case they kidnap a medic and present his evidence by video to a solar-system-wide audience, which is successful. In the meantime the rest of the crew have recovered, and after a final effort of negotiation the Solar Queen preserves its reputation by selling the contract with the Salariki to a large intergalactic trading company in exchange for credits and a quiet inter- solar mail route, which should lead to no more trouble.

It is situated near Ingrow Lane on Oakworth Road (B6143) in the west of Keighley. It became a Sports College in 1997, and gained Technology College accreditation in 2004. History =Grammar school= Oakbank was founded from the Drake and Tonson School as Keighley Trade and Grammar School in 1871. Around 1900 it became Keighley Boys' Grammar School (KBGS) on Alice Street. Following a fire in 1962 in the Mechanics' Institute (which also provided the school with its assembly hall and some classrooms) new buildings were built in 1964. Parents and staff over a 4-year period also raised £25,000 for the original swimming pool, now built over. On its move it became firstly and rather confusingly Keighley School for a few years despite still being a grammar, then in 1968 became Oakbank Grammar School with new uniform and oak leaf badge, when administered under Keighley Committee for Education. It is perhaps ironic that the name change to Oakbank Grammar coincided with its change to comprehensive status. Sixth form retained the green blazers with white stripes at this time, and a \\"third year sixth\\" was offered for Oxford and Cambridge candidates to prepare. =Comprehensive= It became a co-educational school in 1967 with one year's intake of sixth form girls, then the following year in 1968 a comprehensive school for ages 14 to 18, under the new name Oakbank Grammar School. The move from a boys' grammar school was phased over a few years with new co-ed comprehensive intakes in what was then known as the Fourth Form. It changed its name to Oakbank School in 1990. During the same period of time the school, with pupils aged 13 to 19, moved to its current site from Bronte Upper School. In 2000 it became a secondary school for 11- to 19-year-olds through a re- organisation of British schools. Throughout the years the school has gained improved status and is currently a double specialist school in sports and technology, the first awarded in 2001 and the second in 2004. The school was visited by former Minister for Sport, Gerry Sutcliffe. Curriculum The school has been graded as satisfactory or better in all areas of the curriculum in its last two Ofsted inspections. Around 52% of pupils achieved five A* to C grade passes at GCSE in 2008.

In 2006, Byrnes was the lone Democrat running for State Representative in the district. She faced Republican Shannon Brown in the general election, and she was reelected by over 11000 votes. Byrnes ran for re-election to the State House for the final time in November 2008, due to Michigan term limits. Byrnes' Republican opponent was Eric Lielbriedis, of Saline. She was reelected with over 62% of the vote, and a margin of over 16000 votes. While in the House, Byrnes served as House Speaker Pro Tempore. On December 13, 2009, Pam Byrnes announced her candidacy for State Senate in Michigan's 18th district at the Ypsilanti Freighthouse in Ypsilanti's Depot Town. Five days before the election, an article in a Michigan newspaper revealed that the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP), a Political Action Committee funded in part by Republicans Dick & Betsy DeVos, made two independent expenditures promoting Pam Byrnes and one independent expenditure criticizing her opponent. GLEP lobbies for choice, accountability and quality in education and assists candidates that support education reform. Byrnes lost the Democratic primary to Rebekah Warren, 55-41%. Warren would go on to win the general election.  2014 Congressional election  On July 18, 2013, Pam Byrnes announced her candidacy for Congress in Michigan's 7th congressional district. In announcing her candidacy, Byrnes stated, \\"Washington is broken and Rep. Tim Walberg is part of the problem. Michigan's middle-class is paying the price for his partisan politics that put special interests and corporation before working families.\\" Byrnes was endorsed by EMILY's List. She would go to lose by 53% to 41%.

His most notable role was the 1989 film Cyborg directed by Albert Pyun. Early life Klyn (Klijn) was born in New Zealand. His family relocated to Honolulu, Hawaii and he attended and graduated from Aiea High School. He learned to surf in Hawaii. He went on to compete on the professional surfing circuit at only 13 years of age. Klyn was a competitor in the World Wide Surf tour, and was among the top five surfers in the world at that time. Film career His first and probably most remembered film appearance was his film debut in the 1989 science fiction action film Cyborg, as the main villain Fender Tremolo, playing opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme as the hero, Gibson Rickenbacker. According to the audio commentary on the DVD for Urban Menace, director Albert Pyun found Klyn when he saw him surfing one day, and immediately thought he would be an excellent choice to play a villain, as he had an outstanding physique and intense look. He went on to appear in minor roles in other surfer films, like Red Surf (teaming up with George Clooney) in 1990, and Point Break (going up against Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves) in 1991, but with the exception of Gangland from 2000, he still got the bulk of his major roles in movies directed by Albert Pyun, like Bloodmatch, Kickboxer 2, Dollman, Nemesis, Knights, Blast, The Wrecking Crew, Corrupt, Urban Menace, and Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon from 2004. Other roles that Klyn appeared in were mostly noted as on-screen personalities on the Baywatch television series throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, and he appeared in the episode \\"Showdown\\" in the television series The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. He also had a bit role in Prey of the Jaguar as a thug working for the main antagonist Bandera.

Early life Ogden was born at Durdidwarrah, near Geelong, Victoria and educated at Steiglitz State School until he was 14 and then worked at a variety of jobs in different parts of Australia. From 1896 until 1906 he was a prospector and miner on the west-coast of Tasmania. He married Emma Etta Colls in 1897. He was later president of the Tasmanian branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association. State politics Ogden was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly seat of Zeehan for the Labor Party at the 1906 election. As a result of its abolition he stood for and won one of the seats of Darwin at the 1909 election. In October 1909, he was appointed treasurer in John Earle's minority Labor government, but it lasted only a week. In 1914, Earle returned to power and Ogden became chief secretary and minister for mines and labour until Labor's defeat in April 1916. Federal politics Ogden resigned from the House of Assembly to contest the 1922 election for the Senate and won, holding his seat until his death. In 1925, he supported the Bruce-Page's government's legislation on navigation and immigration, because he considered that the militant Seamen's Union—which it affected—was harmful to Tasmania, an island state. As a result, he was expelled by the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party, and subsequently sat as an independent. At the 1928 election, he won re-election as a Nationalist and he was appointed honorary minister and assistant minister for industry in the third Bruce Ministry from November 1928, until its defeat at the October 1929 election. He died in the Hobart suburb of Moonah.

It opposes a perceived political correctness on college campuses and supports a return to mid-20th-century curricular and scholarship norms, and an increase in conservative representation in faculty. History and organization NAS founding president Stephen Balch receiving the National Humanities Medal from US President George W. Bush Originally called the Campus Coalition for Democracy, the National Association of Scholars was founded in 1987 by Herbert London and Stephen Balch with the goal of preserving the \\"Western intellectual heritage\\". Peter Wyatt Wood is the president. The advisory board of the NAS has included several notable conservatives, such as Jeane Kirkpatrick, a former United States Ambassador to the United Nations and adviser to Ronald Reagan. Chester Finn helped to form the conservative movement's education policies. Irving Kristol, founder of the neoconservative movement, \\"characterized multiculturalism as 'a desperate strategy for coping with the educational deficiencies and associated social pathologies of young blacks.'\\" According to the association, it has affiliates in 46 U.S. states, as well as in Guam and Canada. NAS has received funding from politically conservative foundations, including the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the John M. Olin Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, the Castle Rock Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation, and the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation.. NAS has disputed the conservative label. Writing in 2007, the NAS's current president Peter Wood said: \\"Both Left and the Right produce their share of intellectual obtuseness.\\" Positions and activities William A. Donohue, former NAS board member wrote in American Conservatism: an Encyclopedia (2006) that the NAS wishes \\"to foster renewed respect for the proposition that rational discourse and scholarship are the basis of academic life\\" and to emphasize \\"the Western commitment to freedom and democracy.\\"Donahue, William A. \\"National Association of Scholars,\\" in American Conservatism: an Encyclopedia. Wilmington: ISI Books, 2006. On the other hand, Jacob Weisberg stated in 1991 that NAS is \\"prone to conflating its admirable ideals with far less compelling political prejudices.\\"Weisberg, Jacob. \\"NAS – Who are These Guys Anyway?\\" Lingua Franca Apr. 1991: 34–39 The National Association of Scholars opposes campus speech codes, which it argues violate the First Amendment. The NAS strongly objects to racial and gender preferences in college admissions and hiring, but states that it does not oppose all forms of affirmative action. Time magazine in 1991 called NAS the \\"faculty opposition to the excesses of multiculturalism.\\" The NAS describes its main work as the defense of \\"the core values of liberal higher education.\\" The NAS was an early critic of political correctness, engaged the American Association of University Professors over some of its policies, and complained to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, Lamar Alexander, who ruled that the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools eliminate its diversity standard. NAS's stands have led critics to label NAS \\"conservative\\", a \\"group of reactionary scholars\\" and \\"a leading vehicle for the conservative attack on multiculturalism and political correctness\\". Chapters of the NAS have been involved in a number of campus controversies related to affirmative action and multicultural studies programs. According to People for the American Way, NAS faculty at the University of Texas, Austin blocked the inclusion of civil rights readings in an English course; the readings had been proposed to address concerns about racial and sexual harassment on campus. In 1990, the NAS placed an advertisement in the Daily Texan (the University of Texas student newspaper), calling for the rejection of a proposed multiculturalism curriculum at the University of Texas.Getman, Julius. In the Company of Scholars: the Struggle for the Soul of Higher Education. Austin: University of Texas P, 1992. Simultaneously, the NAS encouraged a successful campaign to defund the university's Chicano newspaper. In 1990, a Duke University chapter of the NAS was formed by political science professor James David Barber. The new chapter provoked \\"a sometimes bitter debate\\" about the NAS stances on race and gender, and on whether academic freedom should extend to what NAS critics viewed as intolerance. Stanley Fish, chairman of the English department at Duke, wrote that NAS \\"is widely known to be racist, sexist and homophobic.\\" In an interview with the Durham Morning Herald, Barber called Fish \\"an embarrassment to this university for his gross insult to this organization.\\" In response to the NAS chapter formation, a larger group of faculty formed \\"Duke Faculty for Academic Tolerance\\". Also in 1990, the Harvard University community debated the presence of the NAS. Writing in the Harvard Crimson, Martin L. Kilson Jr. acknowledged some \\"overzealous behavior by supporters of ethnic studies and women studies\\" but argued that the NAS was an \\"overkill neoconservative response.\\" In Kilson's view, NAS had succumbed to \\"anxiety and maybe phobia\\" of multiculturalism. He asks, \\"why shouldn't persons on our campuses go to great lengths to avoid the tag 'racist'\\"? Or the tags 'homophobic', 'sexist', 'anti-Asian', etc.?\\" In 2001, it was reported that the Colorado Commission on Higher Education had paid the National Association of Scholars $25,000 to generate a report on several Colorado universities with education programs. The NAS report criticized diversity curricula and recommended that the University of Colorado's education program be suspended and new admissions to other programs be halted. University of Colorado, Boulder dean William Stanley resigned in protest of what he called \\"teacher-bashing\\" by the NAS, while regent Bob Sievers deplored \\"anti-teaching, anti-C.U./Boulder, anti-women and anti-minority bias.\\" Questions were also raised regarding why money was paid to a \\"right-wing\\" organization like the NAS rather than to a group \\"with credentials in teacher education.\\" In September 2008, The New York Times described the NAS as among the politically conservative organizations intensively and successfully lobbying for federal funding for programs which emphasize \\"traditional American history, free institutions or Western civilization\\". The Times reported that NAS and allied organizations sought to advance conservative causes by attaching conditions to university donations. In 2011 NAS launched its Center for the Study of the Curriculum to \\"document and to analyze important changes\\" to college curricula and \\"to propose improvements.\\" The center conducts yearly reviews of colleges and universities' common reading programs. The annual Beach Books report identifies the colleges that have these programs, the books they assign, and patterns in the assignments. The 2012–13 report found that 97 percent of colleges and universities chose books published in or after 1990. The most popular book assigned was The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. Writing at The Guardian, the report's author, Ashley Thorne, criticized the lack of classics: \\"The choice of a recent book that is often the only book students will have in common with one another points to the death of a shared literary culture. To the extent that colleges want to approach that culture, they display willful selfishness in confining their sights to the present.\\" NAS president Peter Wood wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education, \\"What is lamentable is the scant attention to important books, let alone classics; the relentless emphasis on the short-term and easily accessible; and the dominance of books that emphasize personal perspectives over efforts to know the world as it really is.\\" NAS also publishes a list of books it recommends for colleges to assign as common reading. In January 2013 the Center for the Study of the Curriculum, along with NAS's affiliate the Texas Association of Scholars, released a report on U.S. history courses taught in the Fall 2010 semester at the University of Texas and Texas A&M; University. The report, Recasting History, examined all 85 sections of lower-division courses that satisfied a Texas statute requiring students at public institutions to take two courses in American history. NAS concluded that a preponderance of the courses emphasized social history focusing especially on race, class, or gender. Other topics such as military, diplomatic, religious, and intellectual history were taught less frequently. After the report's release, Jeremi Suri, the Mack Brown Distinguished Professor for Global Leadership, History, and Public Policy at UT-Austin, called the report \\"misleading, and frankly dumb.\\" Writing in The Alcalde, the official alumni magazine, Suri defended the University of Texas's course offerings, saying, \\"What we are teaching at UT, in almost all of our history and related courses, is a plural history of how many different people and parts of America relate to one another. What we are teaching is the beauty, the color, the promise, and also the challenge of contemporary America.\\" Richard Pells, a former history professor at the University of Texas, wrote in an op-ed for the Austin-American Statesman, \\"I am neither conservative nor a member of the NAS. But I am an American historian who taught at UT from 1971 to 2011. And based on my own experiences at UT, I believe the report's main arguments are absolutely correct.\\" In April 2013, NAS released What Does Bowdoin Teach? How a Contemporary Liberal Arts College Shapes Students. The 383-page study examined Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, presenting it as representative of trends in college education in the United States. The report tracked how the college's decisions over forty years affected the curriculum, academic requirements, advising, faculty hiring, faculty committees, core values, key terms, campus controversies, residence life, disciplinary codes, student government, clubs, sports, and administrative priorities. The authors criticized Bowdoin for abolishing its core curriculum in 1969 and creating the system that remains in place in which there are few general education requirements. They also criticized Bowdoin for what they argued are overly specialized and politicized academic departments, a politically correct environment, and the college's disregard for intellectual diversity. David Feith wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the report \\"demonstrates how Bowdoin has become an intellectual monoculture dedicated above all to identity politics.\\" Bowdoin College's response to the report was mixed. Writing in the Bowdoin Sun (the college's official newspaper) Bowdoin president Barry Mills called the report \\"mean-spirited and personal.\\" Bowdoin Social Sciences professor Jean Yarbrough wrote in The Bowdoin Orient, \\"Although I do not agree with all the findings of the NAS report, I believe that it highlights serious problems with the current state of education at Bowdoin and at elite institutions in general.\\" Academic Questions The NAS's quarterly journal, Academic Questions, publishes articles and interviews on higher education, Academic Questions describes itself as \\"a journal dedicated to strengthening the integrity of scholarship and teaching.\\" In a 1994 review in The Times Literary Supplement, Jonathan Rauch wrote that: \\"Though written mainly by scholars, it is a missionary journal, not a scholarly one.\\" Rauch concluded: \\"If at times hectoring, Academic Questions is that rare and useful thing among journals—a live wire.\\" Most issues of Academic Questions focus on a particular theme in higher education. Previous themes have included \\"Why Study Islam, India, and China?\\"; \\"Why Study the West?\\"; \\"Hard Cases: America's Law Schools\\"; \\"Liberal Education and the Family\\"; and \\"A Crucible Moment? A Forum on the President’s Call for a New Civics\\". Academic Questions has included articles by Jacques Barzun, Eugene Genovese, Thomas Sowell, and Terry Eagleton, and interviews with Tom Wolfe, Julius Lester, Napoleon Chagnon, and Joseph Morrison Skelly. Richard Arum, Jill Biden, Andrew Delbanco, Joseph Epstein, Victor Davis Hanson, Wilfred M. McClay, Charles Murray, and Ibn Warraq were among those who contributed to Academic Questions, \\"One Hundred Great Ideas for Higher Education\\", a symposium in the journal's 100th issue published in 2012.

Written by George Mastras and directed by Bronwen Hughes, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on March 2, 2008.  Plot  Walt and Jesse come to an agreement: Walt will be the cook and silent partner in their meth operation, while Jesse will sell their product on the street. Walt also demands no further bloodshed. Meanwhile, as Walt's chemotherapy continues, he tells Skyler that Elliott's check came and he deposited it, when in fact he is struggling to pay for the treatment and plans on using his meth profits to cover it. At a family therapy session, Skyler tells Walt that she is concerned about his missing hours, but he explains that he just likes to be alone sometimes and take walks. While cooking meth, Jesse observes a radiotherapy burn on Walt's chest and realizes he is trying to take care of his family before he dies of lung cancer. Jesse finishes their current batch and spends all night selling it, bringing Walt his share of $1,300, far less than he expected. Jesse explains they need a distributor if they want to make more money; after Krazy-8's death, Drug lord Tuco Salamanca has taken over his territory. Jesse gains a meeting with Tuco after getting his friend Skinny Pete, who served time in prison alongside Tuco, to vouch for him. Though Tuco is willing to pay $35,000 for a pound of meth, he insists on paying only after his dealers have completed the sales. When Jesse refuses, Tuco severely beats him and lands him in the hospital. Meanwhile, Hank traces the gas mask found in the desert to Walt's high school. Hank and Walt take inventory of the chemistry lab to find other equipment missing, leading Hank to suspect that a student obtained a key to the lab storage room. Later, Hank arrests a school janitor named Hugo, who would have had the keys and had a previous record for drug possession. Walt feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about his hospitalization. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco. Now starting to lose his hair from the chemo, Walt decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name \\"Heisenberg,\\" demanding $50,000 from Tuco$35,000 for the meth Tuco took from Jesse, and $15,000 for pain and suffering for Jesse's treatment. Seeing Walt with another bag of material, Tuco calls his bluff and threatens Walt. Walt throws a piece of the material against the floor which explodes. The entire floor is shaken, blowing out the windows and knocking everyone in the room off their feet. Walt reveals that the bag contains fulminated mercury. Walt threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground. Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as agreeing to a purchase for the next week, offering Walter $35,000 for the next pound of meth. Walt demands instead that Tuco buy two pounds of meth a week for $70,000. Tuco, incredulous, agrees. Walt leaves the building. Once back in his car, Walt exhibits an intense rush from what he has just done.  Production  The episode was written by George Mastras, and directed by Bronwen Hughes; it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on March 2, 2008.  Title meaning  The episode title is a part of a line from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke. A \\"handful of nothing\\" means that one lacks valuable cards in one's poker hand and has two options: give up or bluff. This is also alluded to in a scene where Walter wins a family poker game by bluffing. > Dragline: Oh Luke, you wild, beautiful thing. You crazy handful of nothin'.  Critical reception  Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.8 out of 10 commenting: \\"There is a certain truism about television and this is it: start an episode with an explosion and we like you. Start it off with an explosion and someone walking away with a bag full of cash and no explanation, we love you. Build up five episodes that were leading to a conclusion as drastic as this, and we'll worship the ground you walk on.

This clock was purchased in 1929 and used in physicist Paul R. Heyl's measurement of the gravitational constant. On the left is the primary pendulum in its vacuum tank. The Shortt–Synchronome free pendulum clock was a complex precision electromechanical pendulum clock invented in 1921 by British railway engineer William Hamilton Shortt in collaboration with horologist Frank Hope-Jones, and manufactured by the Synchronome Co., Ltd. of London, UK. They were the most accurate pendulum clocks ever commercially produced, and became the highest standard for timekeeping between the 1920s and the 1940s, after which mechanical clocks were superseded by quartz time standards. They were used worldwide in astronomical observatories, naval observatories, in scientific research, and as a primary standard for national time dissemination services. The Shortt was the first clock to be a more accurate timekeeper than the Earth itself; it was used in 1926 to detect tiny seasonal changes in the Earth's rotation rate. Shortt clocks achieved accuracy of around a second per year, although a recent measurement indicated they were even more accurate. About 100 were produced between 1922 and 1956. Shortt clocks kept time with two pendulums, a primary pendulum swinging in a vacuum tank and a secondary pendulum in a separate clock, which was synchronized to the primary by an electric circuit and electromagnets. The secondary pendulum was attached to the timekeeping mechanisms of the clock, leaving the primary pendulum virtually free of external disturbances. Description The Shortt clock consists of two separate units: the primary pendulum in a copper vacuum tank 26 cm diameter and 125 cm high attached to a wall, and a precision pendulum clock locked to it, standing a few feet away. To prevent any possibility of coupling between the pendulums, the two units were either installed far apart in different rooms, or the units were oriented so the planes of swing of the two pendulums were ninety degrees apart. The secondary clock was a modified version of a standard Synchronome precision regulator clock. The two components were linked by wires which carried electric pulses that operated electromagnets in the mechanisms to keep the two pendulums swinging in synchronism. The primary pendulum rod and its 14-pound weight were made of the alloy invar to reduce thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum, which causes the pendulum's period to vary with changes in temperature. The residual thermal expansion rate was compensated to zero with a metal insert under the bob. The vacuum tank was evacuated by a hand-operated pump to a pressure of around 30 mm Hg to prevent changes in atmospheric pressure from affecting the rate of the pendulum, and also to greatly reduce aerodynamic drag on the pendulum, which increased its Q factor from 25,000 to 110,000,Matthys, 2004, p.112 thus increasing its accuracy by a factor of four. Experiments by Shortt showed that at 30 mm Hg the energy consumed by the flexing of the suspension spring just equalled the energy consumed by deflecting the residual air molecules and therefore a higher vacuum was not required. Both pendulums were seconds pendulums, about 1 meter (39 in) long, with a period of 2 seconds; each swing of the primary took exactly one second, with the secondary's natural rate very slightly longer. The pendulums received a push from the mechanism once every 30 seconds to keep them swinging. The secondary clock had two clock dials on it, showing the time kept by each pendulum, to verify that they were synchronized. It also had electrical terminals which produced a 1 Hz timing signal. Wires could be attached to these to transmit the clock's ultra-accurate time signal to clocks in other cities, or broadcast it by radio. Reason for accuracy Primary pendulum tank A pendulum swinging in a vacuum without friction, at a constant amplitude free of external disturbances, theoretically keeps perfect time. However, pendulums in clocks have to be linked to the clock's mechanism, which disturbs their natural swing, and this was the main cause of error in precision clocks of the early 20th century. An ordinary clock's mechanism interacts with the pendulum each swing to perform two functions: first, the pendulum must activate some kind of linkage to record the passage of time. Second, the clock's mechanism, triggered by the linkage, must give the pendulum a push (impulse) to replace the energy the pendulum loses to friction, to keep it swinging. These two functions both disturb the pendulum's motion. The advantages of the Shortt clock are first, it reduced the disturbance of the primary pendulum due to the impulse by only giving the pendulums an impulse once every 30 seconds exactly (30 pendulum swings), and second, it eliminated all other interaction with the primary pendulum by generating the necessary precise timing signal to control the secondary clock (and record the passage of time) from the impulse mechanism itself, leaving the pendulum to swing \\"free\\" of interference. How it worked The primary and secondary pendulums were linked together in a feedback loop which kept the secondary synchronized with the primary. The secondary clock had a mechanical escapement using a 15-tooth count wheel which was moved forward each right-hand pendulum swing by a pawl attached to the pendulum. Every 15 oscillations (30 seconds), this escapement released a gravity lever which gave the secondary pendulum a push. As it fell, the secondary pendulum's gravity lever closed a switch which activated an electromagnet that reset (raised) the secondary pendulum gravity lever and also sent a pulse of current to an electromagnet in the primary unit which released a second gravity lever to give the primary pendulum a push. The impulse to the primary pendulum was provided by the weight of the primary pendulum's gravity lever (acting as a remontoire) rolling off a wheel attached to the primary pendulum, this mechanism ensuring that the primary pendulum received an identical mechanical impulse every 30 seconds from the primary pendulum gravity lever, at very close to precisely the same part of its stroke. The falling primary pendulum gravity lever closed a pair of contacts in a second electrical circuit, which reset that lever and provided an electrical pulse back to the hit and miss synchronizer in the secondary unit. Though the beginning of the cycle, commenced by the secondary unit, could vary by a very small amount each thirty seconds, the resetting and synchronizing action (which only took point at the moment the jewel of the primary clock gravity arm assembly rolled off the wheel on the pendulum) was fixed to the position of the primary pendulum and represented the accurate time derived from the \\"free\\" (primary) pendulum. =Hit and miss synchronizer= The pulse from the primary pendulum was used to keep the secondary pendulum in phase with it through a device called a \\"hit and miss synchronizer\\". Every 30 swings, after the primary pendulum was impulsed, the position of the two pendulums was compared. This was done by an electrical pulse from the second circuit, activated by the primary pendulum's gravity lever, which used a second electromagnet in the secondary unit to move a vane into the path of a leaf spring attached to the secondary pendulum. If the secondary pendulum lagged behind the primary, the spring would catch on the vane (called a \\"hit\\"). The spring would give the secondary pendulum a push, which shortened the time for that swing. If the secondary pendulum was ahead of the primary pendulum (a \\"miss\\") the leaf spring would miss the vane and the secondary pendulum would make its normal swing, without acceleration from the leaf spring. The secondary pendulum was set to a slightly slower rate than the primary, so the secondary would lag behind the primary more each interval until it received a \\"hit\\" which set it ahead again. Typically the acceleration resulting from a \\"hit\\" would be adjusted to be about twice the normal loss, so that \\"hit\\" and \\"miss\\" cycles would roughly alternate, hence the name of the mechanism. This cycle, repeated over and over, kept the secondary precisely in step with the primary over the long term. This feedback loop functioned as an electromechanical version of a phase-locked loop, later used in electronics and quartz and atomic clocks. Recent accuracy measurement In 1984 Pierre Boucheron studied the accuracy of a Shortt clock preserved at the US Naval Observatory., cited in Rolling Ball Web Bibliography Using modern optical sensors which detected the precise time of passage of the pendulum without disturbing it, he compared its rate to an atomic clock for a month. He found that it was stable to 200 microseconds per day (2.31 ppb), equivalent to an error rate of one second in 12 years, far more accurate than the 1 second per year that was previously measured. His data revealed the clock was so sensitive it was detecting the slight changes in gravity due to tidal distortions in the solid Earth caused by the gravity of the Sun and Moon.

It was conceived in the prosperous time that proceeded the Great Depression by a prominent group of San Francisco businessmen (primarily Union League of San Francisco club members) who would spare no expense during the design-phase of the project. The golf course was designed by Alister MacKenzie who considered it one of the top three courses on the West Coast.San Mateo Times August 21, 1929, Page 5 The unforeseen economic downturn of the Great Depression caused the club to become financially insolvent and in 1933 it was reorganized as Millbrae Country Club.San Mateo Times, March 14, 1933 In 1945 the club was named Green Hills Country Club.San Mateo Times March 20, 1945 Search for the site The Union League members began searching for a site to build a world-class facility in the 1920s. They spent years looking for a property that was: [1] near the city of San Francisco, [2] land suitable for the construction of a championship golf course, [3] property with a natural water supply, and [4] weather that was outside of the fog belt. In 1927 they found the ideal site for the club in the hills above a small town on the San Francisco Peninsula, Millbrae. The site featured very fertile land, in fact the property had been cultivated as a nursery for many decades. Flowers and shrubs grown on the property were actually utilized by famed horticulturist John MacLaren in the 1915 Pan Pacific Exposition, or World's Fair.San Mateo Times, Sept. 9, 1927 The property had year-round water (from natural creeks), and undulating topography featuring gorgeous vistas. The property could be reached from San Francisco by the members’ automobiles traveling down a road that led to the Peninsula, the El Camino Real. Design team After the land was secured the Union League selected a design team that could build a world-class golf course, and a modern clubhouse. The Union League members would spare no expense in the golf and building architects. The members of the future Union League Golf and Country Club retained renowned golf course architect Alister MacKenzie to design an 18-hole golf course on the property. MacKenzie would be aided by two-time U.S. Amateur Champion Henry Chandler Egan and collegiate champion Robert Hunter.San Mateo Times, March 1, 1929 The prestigious design firm of Willis Polk and Company was chosen as the clubhouse architect.San Mateo Times March 19, 1930 Willis Polk and Company were highly acclaimed and responsible for many architectural gems throughout Northern California. Willis Polk, who was considered the architectural mastermind of the rebuilding of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake, died in 1924. His architectural firm, however carried on in his tradition and developed the plans for the Union League Golf and Country Club structure. The chief architect in charge of the project was Angus McSweeney. MacKenzie, with help from Hunter and Egan, utilized the existing topography and with minimal grading sculpted an 18-hole layout that would soon draw rave reviews as a world-class golf course. The course featured some of the most undulating greens ever built and the bunkering rivaled recently completed Cypress Point in Monterey. According to news accounts, “No expense has been spared to build the best. As witness of that, the piping is of cast iron. But one other course in Northern California has that, it is said”. The opening The San Francisco press covered the April 27, 1930, opening day events and gave glowing reviews to the golf course, calling it “happy valley” and “the equal of anything in Northern California.” A local newspaper indicated “MacKenzie, in fact, was loud in praise of the topography of the acreage, and declares it one of his best pieces of work, which is ample praise, coming from the reticent Englishman.” Groundbreaking of The Union League Golf and Country Club took place on January 6, 1929, ten months prior to the crash of the Stock Market. Although the course was ready for play in January 1930, the members voted to delay opening until “all possibility of damage to the greens by premature use” had been eliminated. (There was also a “washout” on the first fairway that required of “drain tile” prior to the opening). The Golf Course officially opened to considerable fanfare on April 27, 1930, when more than 200 golfers teed off at the new golf course that the press called “one of the finest in California”. The first ceremonial ball was hit from a silver tee by Samuel Welfield, the club's vice president, as the president, William J. Bevan, was out of town. The San Francisco Press reported, “The course measures from the middle tees , and from Champion tees, . There are two routes to each hole, after the typical MacKenzie fashion, for the dub and star alike.” They went on to say, “The acreage, which used to be a nursery, still bears the resemblance. On several of the fairways the roughs are fruit tree orchards. The entire are bordered and dotted by cypress, pine, oak, redwood and other variety of trees. Over 100,000 saplings are being nursed for further beautification of the land.” In 1930 a prominent sign was placed at the corner of El Camino Real and Ludeman Lane. The words “Union League Golf and Country Club West could be seen by anyone on El Camino Real. A picture of the sign, with the 16 Mile House (at its original location) in the background, was included in the Sunday August 10, 1930, issue of the San Francisco Chronicle. Opening of the Union League Golf Course was the feature story on the front page of the newspaper. The cost of building the golf course, including MacKenzie’s fee, amounted to $140,000. The cost to purchase the land was $250,000. The clubhouse and furnishing generated another $150,000 which brought the total cost to approximately $540,000. The contractor for the clubhouse project was Charles T. Magill, a member of the Union League Club in San Francisco. Magill won the “opening day” golf tournament.San Mateo Times, April 28.1930 The original fee to join the Union League Club was $1,250 with membership limited to 300. The opening gala dedication and dinner dance was held on August 23, 1930. The San Mateo Times reported that “Over three hundred members and their friends gathered in the new building which is one of the finest country clubs in California, and enjoyed the delightful entertainment prepared by the inauguration committee.”Green Hills Country Club archives material The times went on to report, ”W.J. Bevan, Burlingame resident and vice-president of the Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco is president of the club and has directed the details of construction which brings to the Peninsula a new golf course and clubhouse that is a real asset to the community. The new club is complete in every detail that could add to the comfort and pleasure of the members. It is a structure of charming architecture and embodies every modern facility of an up to date clubhouse.” The first head professional was Harry Kennett. Sam Smith, a former Harding Park starter, was the first “starter” and assistant Club Manager. The first Club Manager was C.L. Westlake. MacKenzie and the design team Alister MacKenzie was acknowledged to be one of the three leading golf course architects of his day (along with A. W. Tillinghast and Donald Ross) and was the author of Golf Course Design which told of his design philosophy. MacKenzie influenced countless architects from that time to the present. He also wrote The Spirit of St. Andrews, which became the famous “lost manuscript” until it was rediscovered and published long after his death in 1934. Robert Hunter was a good golfer and a socialite with “connections” that helped bring attention to various MacKenzie course design projects. He oversaw construction of the course in collaboration with MacKenzie. His gregarious manner also helped to build membership after the club was formed. Moreover, Hunter was a devotee of links-style golf courses and published a seminal book on golf course architecture titled Links. H. Chandler Egan, was a golfing champion of national stature having won the U. S. Amateur Championship in 1904 and 1905 and the Pacific Northwest championship in 1915, 1920, 1923, 1925 and 1932. He was also an accomplished architect in his own right, having designed several outstanding courses in Oregon. He also achieved considerable acclaim for his remodeling of Pebble Beach Golf Links in preparation for the 1929 U. S. Amateur Championship. He redesigned the greens and bunkering giving them a ragged, natural seaside look that was very dramatic. (It is worth noting that Egan finished second in that 1929 U.S. Amateur Championship). MacKenzie, however, redesigned the eighth hole which has been acclaimed as one of the great par fours of the world. Significantly, Bobby Jones was defeated early in that 1929 championship which led to his visiting Cypress Point and Pasatiempo. These visits prompted Bobby Jones to select Mackenzie for the design of Augusta National in place of Donald Ross and a tradition was born. Economic realities By 1933 economic reality set in and the Union League Golf and Country Club filed for bankruptcy. The club was reorganized as semi-private Millbrae Golf and Country Club. During the period around World War II many of the original MacKenzie bunkers were filled in (a cost-cutting measure that occurred in golf courses throughout America) and sodded over. In 1945 Millbrae Golf and County Club became the private Green Hills Country Club, which it remains to this day. During the 1990s many of the original MacKenzie design features (and bunkers) were restored.

Phys. Math. Soc. Jpn. 22: 264-314 . is a quasiprobability distribution commonly used in quantum mechanics to represent the phase space distribution of a quantum state such as light in the phase space formulation.Ulf Leonhardt (1997).

It is also applied in the study of quantum effects in superconductors. Husimi distribution of the squeezed coherent state Husimi distribution function of three coherent states merged Definition and properties The Husimi Q distribution (called Q-function in the context of quantum optics) is one of the simplest distributions of quasiprobability in phase space. It is constructed in such a way that observables written in anti-normal order follow the optical equivalence theorem. This means that it is essentially the density matrix put into normal order. This makes it relatively easy to calculate compared to other quasiprobability distributions through the formula : Q(\\\\alpha)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\langle\\\\alpha|\\\\hat{\\\\rho}|\\\\alpha\\\\rangle, which is effectively a trace of the density matrix over the basis of coherent states \\\\\\\\{|\\\\alpha\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}. It produces a pictorial representation of the state ρ to illustrate several of its mathematical properties.Cosmas K. Zachos, David B. Fairlie, and Thomas L. Curtright (2005). Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space, (World Scientific, Singapore) . Its relative ease of calculation is related to its smoothness compared to other quasiprobability distributions. In fact, it can be understood as the Weierstrass transform of the Wigner quasiprobability distribution, i.e. a smoothing by a Gaussian filter, :Q(\\\\alpha)= \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int W(\\\\beta) e^{-2|\\\\alpha-\\\\beta|^2} \\\\, d^2\\\\beta. Such Gauss transforms being essentially invertible in the Fourier domain via the convolution theorem, Q provides an equivalent description of quantum mechanics in phase space to that furnished by the Wigner distribution. Alternatively, one can compute the Husimi Q distribution by taking the Segal–Bargmann transform of the wave function and then computing the associated probability density. Q is normalized to unity, : \\\\int Q(\\\\alpha)\\\\,d\\\\alpha^2 = 1 and is non-negative definite and bounded: : 0 \\\\leq Q(\\\\alpha) \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}. Despite the fact that is non-negative definite and bounded like a standard joint probability distribution, this similarity may be misleading, because different coherent states are not orthogonal. Two different points do not represent disjoint physical contingencies; thus, Q(α) does not represent the probability of mutually exclusive states, as needed in the third axiom of probability theory. may also be obtained by a different Weierstrass transform of the Glauber–Sudarshan P representation, :Q(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^*)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int P(\\\\beta,\\\\beta^*) e^{-|\\\\alpha-\\\\beta|^2} \\\\, d^2\\\\beta, given \\\\hat{\\\\rho} = \\\\int P(\\\\beta,\\\\beta^*) |{\\\\beta}\\\\rangle \\\\langle {\\\\beta}|\\\\, d^{2}\\\\beta, and the standard inner product of coherent states.

It is an erect, bushy shrub with small, crowded, thick leaves and spikes of red and pink flowers in spring. Description Verticordia halophila is a shrub which grows to high and wide and which has a few main stems with many short, leafy side-branches. The leaves on the side branches are crowded, oblong to egg-shaped, thick with a rounded end but with a short point and covered with soft hairs less than long. The leaves on the flowering stems are broadly egg-shaped to almost round. The flowers are scented and arranged in spike-like groups near the ends of the long flowering stems, each flower on a stalk, long. The floral cup is top-shaped, long, smooth and glabrous with 5 ribs and small bent green appendages. The sepals are pink with a white fringe, long, with 5 or 6 hairy lobes and two ear-shaped, hairy appendages on the sides. The petals are mauve- pink, erect, , with short, coarse teeth along their top edge. The style is long, curved with short hairs near its purple tip. Flowering time is from September to December. It is distinguished from similar verticordias by its thick, crowded leaves, the serrations on the top edge of the petals, the purple-tipped style and by the saline environment in which it is found. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia halophila was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia. The type collection was made by Alex and Elizabeth George south of Coorow in 1985. The specific epithet (halophila) is \\"named from the Greek hals (salt) and -philus (loving), in reference to the habitat which is unusual in the genus\\". When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Verticordella along with V. pennigera, V. blepharophylla, V. lindleyi, V. carinata, V. attenuata, V. drummondii, V. wonganensis, V. paludosa, V. luteola, V. bifimbriata, V. tumida, V. mitodes, V. centipeda, V. auriculata, V. pholidophylla, V. spicata and V. hughanii. Distribution and habitat This verticordia usually grows in sand and clay on flats that are slightly saline and on the edges of salt lakes in woodland and shrubland. It is found in and near areas around Coorow, Marchagee and Lake Seabrook in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia halophila is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Some forms of this species are being grown in cultivation and are performing well. Some are bushy shrubs which are producing honey-scented flowers from October to March, sometimes in other months.

Its title derives from the recurring Richard Herring trope of misspelling names for comic effect. Described as a \\"sideways look at the news\\", the podcast was discursive and based mainly on humorous analysis of the week's media coverage. It was light in tone but often veered into black comedy and crude humour as satire. It contained frequent uses of strong language and was described by a review in The Times as unsuitable for \\"sensitive souls\\". A typical episode length was one hour, six minutes and thirty-six seconds, due to this being the maximum length of a GarageBand recording, the software normally used to record the podcast. The podcast was made for and hosted by the British Comedy Guide and was also distributed via iTunes. On 26 July 2008, the podcast was named \\"Podcast of the Week\\" by the Times Newspaper and in November 2009, was regularly being downloaded by 23,000 listeners a week, with some episodes peaking at 29,000 listeners. The Guardian noted that the podcast captured \\"the spirit of Derek and Clive.\\" History Between 10 April 2005 and 25 March 2007, Richard Herring would review the week's newspapers on Andrew Collins' BBC 6 Music radio show. These segments would often end with corpsing. Collins and Herring have mentioned that they had felt constrained by BBC guidelines and had wanted to produce a darker, more humorous segment with a longer runtime. The idea of producing an independent podcast was first mooted publicly on Collins' blog on 14 January 2008, leading to a number of comments in support of the idea. The first Collings and Herrin Podcast went live on 1 February 2008. In June 2011, the podcast was announced to be on hiatus due to bad feelings between the pair. Andrew took an opportunity to host their old Saturday 6Music slot with another comedian, Josie Long, which Richard considered a betrayal of their double act. The podcast was resurrected on 4 November 2011 for podcast 167, but on 21 November the podcast ended permanently due to Andrew Collins feeling it was time to end the project. In other media Live shows: An unusual development for a podcast was a number of recordings with a live audience, the first being on 6 August 2008 at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and others following in Brighton, London, Lincoln, Cardiff and more Edinburgh Festival shows. During 2009 these were often presented alongside Andrew Collins' solo 60 minute Secret Dancing performances. On 1 February 2010, the second anniversary of their first podcast, the pair performed their \\"100th\\" podcast (in actuality their 105th) to a sell-out crowd at the Leicester Square Theatre in London. Radio: In January 2010 it was announced that the duo (as \\"Collins and Herring\\" rather than \\"Collings and Herrin\\") would be filling in for Adam and Joe on BBC 6 Music from 30 January. Their residency continued until April 2011. Each week the highlights were released as podcasts on the BBC website. CD: On 22 March 2010 they released a CD of exclusive podcasts called Collings and Herrin: The Best of Earth, Wind and Fire(and water) through Go Faster Stripe. A second CD called Collings and Herrin: War and Peace, Crime and Punishment was released through Go Faster Stripe on 15 December 2010. Vodcast: A number of video podcasts have been released parallel to the official podcast count. These are usually released as bonus features on Richard Herring comedy DVDs. Bootleg: A bootleg recording of \\"legendary\\" Podcast 123 rescued this installment from permanent loss: This episode, recorded live at the 2010 Edinburgh Festival, is dubbed \\"legendary\\" in that technical problems ruined the official podcast recording and resulted in an audience evacuation towards the end of the show. For three weeks, the podcast was assumed lost until a fan came forward with a bootleg recording of poor but serviceable sound quality.  Themes and running jokes  * Humour is mainly derived from the week's media coverage, particularly that of the tabloid newspapers. A favourite source of comedy has been the right-wing writing of Sun columnist Jon Gaunt and Daily Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn. * Aside from media commentary, there are interpersonal running jokes. There is an ongoing parody of sexual tension as a plot device: Herring often suggests that he harbours amorous feelings for his co-presenter and discusses situations in which a seduction (or even a rape) might occur. Despite this layer of their relationship, a further running joke is that Collins and Herring are categorically colleagues and not friends. * While on the podcast, Herring describes himself as the \\"Podcast Richard Herring\\": an alter-ego of the real Richard Herring afflicted with a Tourettes-like tendency to take jokes too far. Given that Herring often doesn't listen to the podcast and immediately forgets what took place during the recording, he has said that \\"maybe malign spirits possess me for 66 minutes and 36 seconds, meaning I have little to no memory of anything we talked about.\\" * For several early episodes, Collins reported a fascination with various examples of cottaging graffiti that he was finding between the tiles of the British Library toilets. Subsequently, encouraged by Herring, the words \\"Collings is a Bummer\\" became a widespread toilet-wall meme, and fans can still find them scrawled in grouting across the country. * In one episode, Herring describes the act of facial ejaculation, including the appreciative sound one might make while on the receiving end: \\"nyum nyum nyum\\". This joke has subsequently been incorporated as a catchphrase in the podcast but also leaked into other work, such as their BBC 6 Music show. Another catchphrase from Herring: \\"Andrew Collings is a fucking idiot,\\" has appeared several times in the BBC 6 Music show as the toned-down \\"Andrew Collins is a fricking idiot\\", and is the only catchphrase to have been included and then withdrawn from their collection of T-shirt designs. * Following a controversy in the sixth season of Strictly Come Dancing and the telephone voting irregularities of later showsJohn Sergeant dances through divide, BBC News, 17 November 2008 both Collins and Herring have employed the shrill exclamation \\"I paid a pound\\" (and variants thereof) to decry the false sense of entitlement felt by members of the public who have paid a meagre amount of money to register their opinions. * Andrew Collins often mentions his real-life pet subject, the Mitford Sisters, which Herring denounces as boring and of no comedic value. Collins has produced a special solo podcast in which he delivers a lecture on this subject to a live audience. * Wikipedia has played a part in some episodes of the podcast: listeners would subtly or blatantly alter Wikipedia entries when both Collins and Herring suggested they do so. As a consequence, Duncan Norvelle's page was temporarily locked to prevent people from adding various absurdities to his list of catchphrases. =Who is Virgilio Anderson?= Collins and Herring launched a culture jamming campaign, spreading the message \\"Who is Virgilio Anderson?\\" after a so-named member of the public from Macedonia used Richard Herring's name as the primary key for his Facebook page. T-shirts were printed, Anderson-themed music videos were circulated on YouTube and many personalities (such as Steven Moffat) added the phrase to their websites. #virgilioanderson became the second most popular trending topic on Twitter on Thursday 2 July 2009 and the words \\"Who is Virgilio Anderson?\\" were scribbled in the grouting of the tiles in a toilet cubicle at the British Library (the cubicle second from the left in the east wing, first floor) on 16 July 2009. Little is known of the true identity of Virgilio Anderson but information on his interests, favourite books and political beliefs were visible at his Facebook page, before it was deleted.

This stagecoach town came into existence in 1886. The nearest inhabited town is Wellington. The remaining buildings are located mostly on private property and permission must be granted before accessing them. Alfred Lund came from Nephi in the spring of 1885 with his cattle and was the first homesteader in Argyle Canyon. Mr. Lund's first home, a log cabin, stands in ruins on the south side of the creek. Tom Taylor also homesteaded this ground before the Army built the road through to Fort Duchesne and the Uintah Basin in 1886.A Brief History of Carbon County by the Teachers, Pupils, and Patrons of Carbon District. Lamont Poulter 1930 In the 1890s, the government was freighting to Fort Duchesne over a road which passed through Nine Mile Canyon. This road is the lowest in elevation of any road between Price and the Uintah Basin. During the years 1888 to 1895 there were 600 soldiers at Fort Duchesne who hauled their supplies over this route. As nothing of any consequence was raised at the Post everything had to be shipped in: hay, grain, and other produce. Ed Lee purchased Taylor's homestead and it became known as \\"Lee Station\\", a stagecoach stop. A large barn housed the recuperating horses for the stage line and was noted for having a \\"real\\" sink. The army installed steel telegraph poles in the Canyon around 1886, that were American Civil War surplus. This telegraph line became the telephone line into the Basin in 1907 and remained until 1917. The poles have since served a local line until the 1990s.The Pioneer Saga of the Nine Mile Road, H. Bert Jenson. Published by The Ink Spot (1993). According to government maps in the 1890s the name of the settlement is \\"Nine Mile\\", but some traditional accounts called it \\"Minnie-Maud\\", named for two girls who lived there. A creek that feeds Nine Mile Canyon is still called Minnie Maud. When the post office was established the town was named Harper. The greatest number of votes ever cast in the voting precinct was 72 in 1900. Starting sometime before 1895, residents of Nine Mile Canyon struggled to keep a school district going. The first school house, built of logs by residents, sat in the mouth of Argyle Canyon. Until 1916 there were two schools, one in Carbon County and one in the Duchesne district. From 1916 to 1924, one school was maintained. This was closed for good in 1931 and moved to Wellington in the 1930s; it later burned. Today, only a few structures remain, including the old stagecoach stop and some other log dwellings. The two-story Harper Hotel burned to the ground in the late 1980s or early 1990s; only the stone foundation remains now. Most of the town site is on private property, so permission is required to explore the area.

The lagoon itself consists of 610 acres with a drainage basin of about 55,000 acres. Its primary freshwater tributaries being San Marcos Creek from the east and Encinitas Creek which flows north along Green Valley, entering the lagoon under El Camino Real and La Costa Avenue, respectively. It is one of the few remaining tidal wetlands on the southern California coast. Nature Reserve Part of the lagoon is designated as the Batiquitos Lagoon State Marine Conservation Area, run by the California Department of Fish and Game as a nature reserve.California Department of Fish and Game: Batiquitos Lagoon State Marine Conservation Area The Batiquitos Lagoon Foundation is a private non-profit organization that works to preserve the lagoon and educate the public about the natural history of the lagoon. The Foundation operates the Batiquitos Lagoon Foundation Nature Center, with programs and guided walks about the importance of the lagoon as a habitat for birds, insects, plants, fish, mammals and benthic organisms. The nature center is open daily.Batiquitos Lagoon Foundation The north side of the lagoon has a 1.75 mile nature trail that roughly follows its shore. The trail is generally wheelchair and stroller friendly. History Evidence of human habitation around Batiquitos Lagoon dates back 8,000 years. The Batiquitos Lagoon is said to have been a trading outpost for pirates in the 1600s. Although no evidence has been found, there is a local legend that claims that there is buried treasure on the island. The area around the lagoon was opened to homesteading in the 1870s. Various building projects and roads around the lagoon over the next 100 years blocked the necessary ebb and flow of the tides and silted the lagoon up, making it largely freshwater. This had an impact on the ecosystem and reduced the fish diversity to only five species. In 1997, the Port of Los Angeles et al. began the environmental restoration of Batiquitos Lagoon. Since the end of construction, the ecosystem of the lagoon has gradually changed from a confined non-tidal system with limited habitat value to fully tidal, salt water system with greater habitat value. Since the restoration of tidal action to the lagoon, the fish populations have significantly increased in numbers and diversity and more than sixty-five species have been found. Lagoons serve as breeding and nursery areas for a wide array of coastal fish, provide habitat and food for resident species and serve as feeding areas for seasonal species.

It is the ninth biggest trade fair in Germany. The new exhibition grounds, which were completed in 2007, are right next to the A8 autobahn (motorway). The centre is accessible from Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe station on the local suburban railway network. Buses also travel to the trade fair centre from nearby Esslingen, Göppingen, Reutlingen and Tübingen.

(Bosch wants to make it into the Guinness Book of Records), Stuttgarter Zeitung Newspaper, 24 September 2007  Brief history  Before completion of the new site next to Stuttgart Airport, Stuttgart Messe was based for more than 50 years in the Killesberg suburb of Stuttgart. As nearby housing estates encroached on trade fair parking and roads, the old fair was closed down to make way for social housing for old aged pensioners and apartments.  Criticism  Immediately after opening, Stuttgart Messe was plagued by a number of unexpected teething problems, ranging from faulty barcode readers at the entrances to poor signage. Construction of the new site, which was originally approved in 1993, was subject to frequent delay. First of all, local farmers refused to sell their land after successful lobbying by nearby residents. After compulsory repossession of land was approved by the Baden-Württemberg State Government, demonstrations came to a peak resulting in a string of court cases between landowners and the company commissioned to build the new trade fair centre. Eventually agreement was reached between the local government and landowners, amid cries from local residents that the farmers had \\"sold out\\" to the politicians and had only gone along with lobbyists in the first place to maximise returns on the sale of land.

To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats have a high limit temperature and a low limit. If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the high limit. The high limit exists for the sake of efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the low limit, ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The low limit is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water.

Cromane play football in maroon and white colours. The club fields teams from under-8 to senior level. The club's name is derived from the village's church, also called Réalt na Mara (Star of the Sea in English). The local national school also carries the same name. There was a club in Cromane in the mid-1950s. Indeed, in 1954, Pat O'Shea played for the Kerry minors as a Cromane player. Players Since 1983 – when the current club was formed – players such as 2015 GAA Football All-Star Donnchadh Walsh, Sean O'Sullivan, Patie Casey (1987 Kerry minor), Seán Walsh, and Deavan O'Flaherty have worn the green and gold of Kerry. In May 2019 Kieran O'Sullivan became the latest Cromane club man to play Kerry minor football when he lined out against Cork in Páirc Uí Rinn, Cork city. Kieran continued to line out at corner-back in each of the Kerry minors' 2019 championship matches. Their season ended with a narrow 0-14 to 0-13 All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Galway in Croke Park. =Donnchadh Walsh= Donnchadh Walsh played Kerry minor for two years (2001/02) as well as under-21 and went on to win three All-Ireland medals (2007, 2009, and 2014). In 2015 Donnchadh was named as left-half forward on the GAA Football All-Stars team. =Sean O'Sullivan= Seán O'Sullivan played Kerry minor in 1998 and then had three years as an under-21, losing the 1999 All-Ireland Under-21 Football final against Westmeath. Seán quickly progressed to the Kerry senior football team and played between 2002 and 2009 during which time he won four All-Irelands himself (2004, 2006, 2007, and 2009). Seán Walsh, a brother of Donnchadh's, was a member of the Kerry under-21 football panel in 2010, while Deavan O'Flaherty was a member of the Kerry minor football panel in 2012. On 2 March 2003, both Donnchadh Walsh and Seán O'Sullivan lined out in the half-forward line for the Kerry senior football team in their National League win (2–11 to 0–14) over Dublin in Killarney. In November 2015 Donnchadh Walsh was the only Kerry player to be selected to play Australia in a one-off International Rules game in Croke Park. Achievements Cromane's first major triumph on the football field came in October 1994 when they claimed the Kerry Novice Championship beating Tuosist by 2-14 to 1-4 at Fitzgerald Stadium, Killarney. It was a feat they repeated in 1998 – again beating Tuosist in the final. Cromane's first Mid Kerry title came in 1999 when they claimed the O'Sullivan Cup title, three more titles quickly followed in 2002, 2003, and 2006. In October 2018 Cromane claimed their fifth Mid Kerry O'Sullivan Cup win.

Divisions in the College of Cardinals  The College of Cardinals was divided into four factions, two political and two curial.L. Pastor, pp5-9 The Imperial faction, the strongest faction in the Sacred College, was headed by Imperial minister Althan; its strength was estimated between twenty and twenty five votes. They represented the interests of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. The Bourbon faction, the group of cardinals who defended the interests of the two Catholic powers ruled by Bourbon kings – France and Spain – included eleven or twelve cardinals. They represented the interests of Louis XV of France and Philip V of Spain. The Clementine party formed the third faction; Annibale Albani, Cardinal-nephew of Clement XI, was leader of the group of cardinals created by his uncle. Their number was estimated between eight and fifteen. Finally, the Zelanti formed the party of cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the Church. Their leader was Cardinal Fabroni. Its strength was estimated between six and twelve. It was generally expected that the two curial factions, the Clementine and the Zelanti, would join their forces in the conclave. Papabili As many as thirty cardinals were considered papabili, but among them Francesco Pignatelli was regarded as the general favourite. He was supported by Austria and had also many adherents among the Zelanti. Annibale Albani officially supported the candidate of Austria, but actually wanted to elect Fabrizio Paolucci, secretary of state of his uncle. Other candidates with serious chances for the election were Corsini, Tanara, Conti, Pamphili, Barbarigo and Gozzadini.L.Pastor, p.10-14 Excommunicated cardinals At the time of death of Pope Clement XI two cardinals, Giulio Alberoni and Louis Antoine de Noailles, were excommunicated. It was decided, however, that they should be invited to the conclave. Cardinal Noailles excused himself because of advanced age and poor health. Another problem concerned Cardinal Vice-Chancellor Ottoboni: he was not yet ordained. But eventually he was also allowed to participate in the conclave.L. Pastor, p. 6 Conclave Only twenty-seven cardinals entered the conclave on March 31.L.Pastor, p.14 By April 9 the number of electors reached only forty. Two last cardinals, Thomas Philip Wallrad de Hénin-Liétard d'Alsace and Damian Hugo Philipp von Schönborn, arrived only on May 7. Cardinal Annibale Albani, taking advantage of the small number of electors (mostly curial cardinals created by his uncle), tried to achieve a quick election of his candidate, Fabrizio Paolucci. In the first scrutiny conducted on April 1 in the morning Paolucci received eight votes in the ballot and two additional in the accessus. In the second scrutiny in the evening of the same day Paolucci was only three votes short of being elected. But at that time Cardinal Althan (the only Crown-Cardinal present in the early ballots) in the name of Emperor Charles VI pronounced the official exclusion against Paolucci.L.Pastor, p.15 The Imperial veto was very successful. On April 2 in the morning not a single vote fell to the Cardinal Secretary of State. On that same day the French Cardinal Rohan entered the conclave. He thanked Althan for his action against Paolucci.L.Pastor, p. 16 During April several candidates were proposed – Spada, Gozzadini, Cornaro, Caracciolo – but none of them had been able to secure significant support.L.Pastor, p.19-20 On April 20 Cardinal Cienfuegos arrived with the fresh instructions of the Imperial Court. At the end of this month it became clear that the best chances for the election was Cardinal Conti, proposed by the French faction. On April 25 Conti obtained seven votes. The Imperial faction, however, still awaited the arrival of their main candidate Pignatelli, and had instructions to vote for Conti only in the last instance. But when Pignatelli eventually joined the electors on May 1, Spain officially excluded his candidature. The collapse of Pignatelli was decisive: the Imperial faction, admitting the impossibility of electing his candidate, agreed to vote for Conti. In the subsequent days the curial factions also promised their support for Conti.L.Pastor, p.21-24 Election of Pope Innocent XIII On May 8 in the morning, in the seventy-fifth ballot, Cardinal Michelangelo de' Conti was elected pope, receiving fifty-four votes out of fifty-five. The only vote against was his own, which he gave to Sebastiano Antonio Tanara, Dean of the College of Cardinals.L.Pastor, p. 25 He accepted his election and took the name of Innocent XIII, in honour of Pope Innocent III, also of the Conti family. A bit later Protodeacon Benedetto Pamphili announced his election to the people of Rome with the ancient formula Habemus Papam,L.Pastor, p. 26 and on May 18 he solemnly crowned him on the steps of the patriarchal Vatican Basilica.S.Miranda: Cardinal Michelangelo de' Conti (Pope Innocent XIII  Notes  References  * List of participant of conclave, 1721 (by S.

Before her war service, she was the luxury ocean liner . Manhattan was built for the United States Lines (a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan's Roosevelt International Mercantile Marine Co.) at Camden, New Jersey by the New York Shipbuilding Company. She was launched on 5 December 1931, sponsored by Mrs. Edith Kermit Roosevelt, widow of former President Theodore Roosevelt. Commercial and pre-war service After trials in and off the Delaware River, Manhattan departed New York City at midnight on 10 August 1932 for her maiden Atlantic crossing. Arriving at Hamburg 10 days later, she made the return voyage to New York in 5 days, 14 hours, and 28 minutes – a record for passenger liners. Proudly carrying the title of \\"the fastest cabin ship in the world\\", the liner continued to ply the North Atlantic from New York to Hamburg, via Cobh, Ireland, Southampton, England; and Le Havre, France, into the late 1930s. When Germany recalled her ships from the high seas during the Sudeten Crisis in September 1938, Manhattan was en route to Hamburg but immediately came about and put into British and French ports instead, to bring back anxious American travelers who feared that they would be engulfed in a European war. After war broke out a year later, she made voyages to Genoa and Naples, Italy. Following the Allied collapse in the lowlands of western Europe in the spring of 1940, she made a transatlantic crossing in July to repatriate American nationals from Portugal. With the European war endangering commercial shipping of neutral nations, Manhattan was then withdrawn from the once- lucrative transatlantic trade and placed in intercoastal service from New York to San Francisco, via the Panama Canal and Los Angeles. =Converted to troop transport= In February 1941, during her third voyage to California, Manhattan ran aground off West Palm Beach, Florida, but was pulled free by tugs after the ship was lightened. After repairs at New York the ship was deliverd to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 14 June 1941 which immediately delivered the ship to the Navy for operation under bareboat charter. The Navy renamed her Wakefield. Converted to a troop transport at Brooklyn, New York by the Robins Drydock Company, her costly furnishings and trappings of a luxury ocean liner were carefully removed and stored for future use. All of the ship's external surfaces were painted in Navy camouflage colors. On 15 June 1941, Wakefield was commissioned, with Comdr. W. N. Derby, USCG in command. On 13 July 1941, Wakefield departed New York to participate in joint Navy – Marine – Army – Coast Guard amphibious training exercises at New River Inlet, North Carolina, in late July and early August. In early November, the troopship proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to take on board British troops. Wakefield, with 6,000 men embarked, and five other transports got underway on 10 November for Cape Town, South Africa. Escorted by a strong screen – which, as far as Trinidad, included – the convoy arrived at Cape Town on 8 December, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. World War II service This drastic change in the strategic situation prompted the convoy to be rerouted to the Far East. On 29 January 1942, Wakefield and West Point arrived at Singapore to disembark troops doomed later to capture by the Japanese upon the fall of the city in the following month. =Bombed at Keppel Harbor= On 30 January 1942, Wakefield commenced fueling at Keppel Harbour for the return voyage and awaited the arrival of some 400 British women and children who were being evacuated to Ceylon. At 1100, lookouts spotted two formations of Japanese bombers – 27 planes in each – approaching the dock area at Keppel Harbor. Unhampered by anti-aircraft fire or British fighter planes, the enemy bombers droned overhead and released a brief rain of bombs on the waterfront. One bomb hit off Wakefield's port quarter, and another blew up in the dock area from the transport's bow before a third struck the ship's \\"B\\" deck and penetrated through to \\"C\\" deck where it exploded in the sick bay spaces. A fire broke out, but it was extinguished in less than one-half hour. The ship's official damage report notes that wood furniture and fittings are contribute to the fires following such bomb hits, though in this case fires were brought under control quickly. The report noted that fire in a medical storeroom completely destroyed a wooden door allowing spread.U.S. Navy War Damage Reports contains numerous such reports for various ships. One of the features of the ship as the liner Manhattan had been the lavish use of rare hardwood panels, moldings and finishings in passenger spaces. Using oxygen masks, fire-fighting and damage control crew extricated five dead and nine wounded. Medical assistance soon came from West Point. Completing her fueling, Wakefield embarked her passengers and got underway soon thereafter, burying her dead at sea at 2200 and pushing on for Ceylon. After disembarking her passengers at Colombo, the ship found that port authorities would not cooperate in arranging for repair of her damage. Wakefield, therefore, promptly sailed for Bombay, India, where she was able to effect temporary repairs and embark 336 American evacuees. Steaming home via Cape Town, the transport reached New York on 23 March and then proceeded to Philadelphia for permanent repairs. =Named a \\"lone wolf\\" transport= Underway on 11 May 1942 for Hampton Roads, Wakefield arrived at Norfolk, Virginia two days later to load cargo in preparation for Naval Transportation Service Operating Plan Lone Wolf. This provided for Wakefield to travel, for the most part, unescorted – relying on her superior speed to outrun or outmaneuver enemy submarines. On 19 May 1942, she embarked 4,725 Marines and 309 Navy and Army passengers for transportation to the South Pacific and moved to Hampton Roads to form up with a convoy bound for the Panama Canal Zone. Arriving at Cristóbal on 25 May 1942, Wakefield was released from the convoy to proceed west. After escorted her out of the Canal Zone, Wakefield proceeded independently to New Zealand and arrived at Wellington on 14 June. Departing one week later, the transport steamed via the Panama Canal and reached New York on 11 July 1942. On 6 August 1942, Wakefield departed New York with Convoy AT-18 – the largest troop convoy yet assembled. A dozen troop transports made up the bulk of the convoy, escorted by 12 warships – cruisers and destroyers. After proceeding via Halifax to Great Britain, Wakefield received orders routing her and three other transports to the River Clyde, where they arrived without incident. On 27 August 1942, Wakefield departed the Clyde estuary as part of Convoy TA-18, bound for New York. =Onboard fire= While the transport was en route to her destination, on the evening of 3 September 1942, fire broke out deep within the bowels of the ship and spread rapidly. In the port column of the formation, Wakefield swung to port to run before the wind while fire-fighting began immediately. Ready service ammunition was thrown overboard to prevent detonation, code room publications were secured, and sick bay and brig inmates were released. and closed to windward to take off passengers, a badly-burned officer, and members of the crew not needed to man pumps and hoses. Other survivors were disembarked by boat and raft, to be picked up forthwith by the screening ships. At 2100, Brooklyn again came alongside to remove the remainder of the crew, while a special salvage detail boarded the ship. On 5 September 1942, towing operations commenced led by the Canadian salvage vessel Foundation Franklin and the big transport was put aground at McNab's Cove, near Halifax, at 1740 on the 8th. When fire-fighting details arrived alongside to board and commence the mammoth operation, fires still burned in three holds and in the crew's quarters on two deck levels. Four days later, the last flames had been extinguished, and the ship was re-floated on the 14th. On 18 September 1942 the ship was purchased by the Navy. While Wakefield was undergoing partial repairs in Halifax harbor, a torrential rainstorm threatened to fill the damaged ship with water and capsize her at her berth. Torrents of rain, at times in cloudburst proportions, poured into the ship and caused her to list heavily. Salvage crews, meanwhile, cut holes in the ship's sides above the waterline, draining away the water to permit the ship to regain an even keel. For the next 10 days, the salvagers engaged in extensive initial repair work – cleaning up the ship, pumping out debris, patching up holes, and preparing the vessel for her voyage to the Boston Navy Yard for complete rebuilding. =Total rebuild= Temporarily decommissioned, the charred liner proceeded for Boston with a four-tug tow, and was declared a \\"constructive total loss.\\" The Government purchased the hulk from the United States Lines and stripped the vessel to the waterline. The repairs and alterations began in the fall of 1942, and lasted through 1943. On 10 February 1944, Wakefield was recommissioned at Boston, with Capt. R. L. Raney, USCG, in command. =Various transport roles= She departed Boston on 13 April 1944, beginning the first of 23 round trips in the Atlantic theater, and three in the Pacific. Between 13 April 1944 and 1 February 1946, Wakefield transported 110,563 troops to Europe and brought some 106,674 men back to America – a total of 217,237 passengers. In many cases, Wakefield operated as a \\"lone wolf\\", except for air coverage a few miles out of a port. Her primary port of call in the European theater was Liverpool – visited so often in fact that the transport's crew nicknamed her \\"The Boston and Liverpool Ferry.\\" The average round-trip voyage took 18 days. After D-Day, 6 June 1944, Wakefield began the first of her trips as a casualty-evacuation ship, bringing home wounded GIs. On occasion, she also brought back German prisoners of war for internment in the United States. Sometimes she even carried both evacuees and prisoners on the same voyage. After 13 trips to Liverpool, Wakefield was sent to the Mediterranean theater to carry men and equipment to Italy. She made three visits to Naples and a run each to Marseille, Oran, Taranto, Le Havre, and Cherbourg-Octeville. Returning from her 22nd voyage to Europe, the transport departed Boston on 4 December 1945 for Taku, China, and a Magic Carpet mission – returning to San Diego, California, on 1 February 1946. Two round trips to Guam, in February through April 1946, rounded out the ship's active service as a Navy transport. Decommission Mooring at New York on 27 May 1946, Wakefield was decommissioned on 16 June 1946 – five years to the day since she first entered service. There she was laid up in reserve, out of commission, with the Maritime Administration's Hudson River Reserve Fleet at Jones Point, New York. She was struck from the Navy Register in 1959. She was sold for scrap to Union Minerals & Alloys Corporation for $263,000 in 1965. Awards Wakefield earned one battle star for her World War II service.

The council headquarters is in Tupelo, Mississippi. The Yocona Area Council, supported by 1,100 volunteers, and 130 chartered partners, serves approximately 6,500 youth annually in one of five programs: Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, Venturing, Learning for Life, and Exploring. History One year after the Boy Scout movement had come to the United States from England around 1911 George F. Maynard, Sr. founded the first troop in Tupelo -- Troop 1. The local scout movement had its ups and downs the first several years as scout units sprung up in other cities such as Corinth and Oxford. In 1926 representatives from local communities met in Tupelo to establish scouting permanently in the area. In choosing a name for the new council, it was decided to call it \\"Yocona,\\" an Indian name that would most nearly represent the entire council than any other. Yocona, or \\"Yakni,\\" is a Choctaw Indian name for \\"the earth.\\" In 1926, the Yocona Area Council consisted of Tate, Panola, Lee, Yalobusha, Marshall, Lafayette, Calhoun, Benton, Tippah, Union, Pontotoc, Alcorn, Prentiss, Tishomingo, and Itawamba counties. The first application for charter for the local council was dated June 25, 1926, and was given as a \\"First Class Council.\\" The first Camp Yocona was held at Springdale Lakes near Myrtle, Mississippi in July 1926. Camp Yocona moved around for the first several summer camps including locations in Booneville and Pickwick lake. A campsite located in Pontotoc County between Tocoppola and Randolph, consisting of , was acquired in 1934 for the purpose of establishing a permanent camp for the Scouts of Yocona Area Council though it would take over 10 years for the camp to be established in 1946-1947. In the 1930s scouting in the council experienced some growing pains. One of the greatest disasters to ever hit north Mississippi occurred on April 5, 1936. A tornado hit Tupelo cutting a path almost a mile wide. As a result of the disaster the Council Office was moved to New Albany. In the fall, it was returned to Tupelo at the request of the Regional Office in Memphis. The new office was in the Knox Building on West Main. In February 1939, the Council was unable to financially retain a full-time professional largely due to the effects of the Great Depression. The Council Office was kept open under the direction of one office secretary until February 1940. Despite the effects of the 1930s, scouting remained viable in the council with the formation of the first Sea Scout Ship and Cub Pack as well as contingents to the National Jamboree and the wilderness camp Philturn (now known as Philmont) in New Mexico. The early 1940s were defined by World War II, but scouting continued throughout the war. In 1941 advanced scouts attending Camp Yocona were given the rare privilege of participating in the initiation ceremonies of the establishment of Chicksa Lodge 202. Chicksa Lodge became the local lodge of the Order of the Arrow, a service society of Honor Campers. In 1943 a separate division, headed up by E.S. Bishop, was created for the council's African American scouts. Later that year the first scout camp was held for black troops. In 1947, Camp Warriner was conceived, established and developed through the leadership of Corinth Scouters. Dr. R.B. Warriner, Sr., was instrumental in securing a site, five miles (8 km) south of Corinth, and in developing the facilities as the Council's camp for black troops. In 1951 the council hired its first black district executive, Palmer Foster, who was one of the first African American executives in the south. During the first five months of 1969, the integration movement was underway and Camp Warriner was used less and less. In 1976, Camp Warriner was sold and the money was put into the Yocona Area Council Trust Fund.Yakni: History of the Boy Scout Movement in Northeast Mississippi, Prince Watkins, 1978 In 1971, Erst Long, Sr. purchased a building at 411 South Spring Street for the new Scout Service Center. This remained the Council Office until May 1989, when a new Service Center was built at 505 Air Park Road. Chauncey Godwin, Sr. chaired the Finance Committee and Eddie Lomenick chaired the Building Committee that built the new facility which serves as the present location of the Yocona Area Council Service Center. Scouting in northeast Mississippi remained a strong and viable part of the community throughout the 1990s with record numbers of Eagle Scouts being produced almost every year. In 2001, the Yocona Area Council celebrated its 75th Diamond Anniversary. During that year, a $1.5 million capital development campaign was successfully conducted to raise the funds necessary to renovate Camp Yocona. In 2004 phase 1 renovations were completed, with additional renovations continuing. Camp Yocona now host cabins, a conference center, first-class shooting sports ranges, a new aquatics facility, air-conditioned dining hall, and new restroom facilities in each campsite. These renovations along with major program updates helped spur a large increase in summer camp attendance during the late 2000s. In 2009 the council camped over 1,000 youth during summer camp programs. In 2007 the council celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement with the national theme \\"Scouting: When Tradition Meets Tomorrow.\\" Then in 2010 the Council celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America, \\"Celebrating the Adventure, Continuing the Journey.\\" The council kicked off the celebration in November 2009 with the Centennial Park Camporee, the largest event in council history. In February 2010 the council hosted the Adventure Base 100, a traveling scout exhibit which toured the country and included a traveling scouting museum.\\"History of the Yocona Area Council,\\" Northeast Mississippi Historical Society, 2010 Districts The Yocona Area Council is divided into four districts: * Apilachi District serving Lee and Itawamba counties * Chicksa District serving Benton, Lafayette, Marshall and Yalobusha counties * Jacinto District serving Alcorn, Prentiss and Tishomingo counties * Tallahatchie District serving Pontotoc, Tippah and Union counties Funding The Yocona Area Council is funded primarily by direct contributions from Scout families, individuals, corporations, alumni and service organizations through the annual Friends of Scouting campaign. These direct contributions form 40% of the council's income. Another 11.4% comes from the support of local United Way organizations. Other income includes camping activities 23%, fundraising events 17.3% and interest generated through operating and endowment funds 8.3%. Service Through the Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, and Venturing programs, the Yocona Area Council serves youth ages 6 through 21. The council offers Learning for Life, a character education program used by local schools. Explorer posts in the council offer vocation-oriented experience to teenage boys and girls in the council's 12 county area. Camp Yocona Camp Yocona is the Boy Scout camp serving the Yocona Area Council. The camp is located about 40 minutes from Tupelo and 90 minutes from Memphis on Hwy 334 between Pontotoc and Oxford. Camp Yocona is open year-round to Scout groups, other non-profit organizations, and corporations. =History= The very first Camp Yocona was held at Springdale Lakes near Myrtle, Mississippi in July 1926.

In addition to scouting activities Camp Yocona often hosts church camps and other groups through the Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience program. Chicksa Lodge The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Chicksa Lodge. It supports the Scouting programs of the council through leadership, camping, and service. =History = C. L. \\"Scottie\\" Carslile was scoutmaster of a troop in Corinth. Scottie had moved to northeast Mississippi from Atlanta, Georgia where he had worked with scouting. In 1941, Scottie brought a team from Atlanta to conduct the first induction ceremony in the state with Alex Beiler as the chief. The induction of a group took place at the first of the two weeks of summer camp. The boys inducted at the first ceremony served to induct a group during the last week of camp. This group of arrowmen make up the charter members of Chicksa 202. The lodge has been chartered and very active since then. The lodge name was derived from the first chief of the mighty Chickasaw Nation. The Chickasaw Nation settled and ruled in what is now northeast Mississippi until they ceded their lands to the United States of America.History of SE-2: Order of the Arrow, Dick Tipton, et al., 1992 =Service= Chicksa Lodge devotes much of its service time to development and maintenance of Camp Yocona.

Initiated on October 27th, 1969, President Richard Nixon authorized a squadron of 18 B-52 bombers to patrol the glacier caps around Moscow and escalate the nuclear threat poised. The goal was to coerce both the Soviet Union and North Vietnam to agree on favourable terms with the US, and conclusively end the Vietnam war. The operation’s effectiveness was also largely built on Nixon’s consistent madman theory diplomacy, in order to influence Moscow’s decision even more (Delpech, 2012). The operation was kept top secret from both the general public and higher authorities within the Strategic Air Command, intended to only be noticed by Russian intelligence. The operation lasted one month before being called off. Background = State of the Vietnam War = Tensions from the Vietnam war remained high and served as a large catalyst behind Nixon’s deployment of the operation. The war was one of Nixon’s primary objectives in his entrance to the office and led to Nixon devising a plan to both end the Vietnam war and gain international and domestic credibility for the United States as a result. By launching an offensive being Operation Giant Lance, Nixon aimed to increase tensions within the war by raising the United States’ nuclear threat through a “show of force” alert. These operations acted as a prequel to Nixon’s eventual Operation Duck Hook declassified in 2005. The primary goal of these operations was to primarily pressure the Soviets in Moscow, to call upon peace terms favourable for the United States with Hanoi in Vietnam. With Operation Duck Hook being declassified in 2005, it was revealed that the “show of force” alert including Operation Giant Lance was meant to prepare for any military confrontation from the Soviets. = Preparation = Earle Wheeler, a United States army general ordered the operation as a part of the raised nuclear alert. Under secrecy, Operation Giant Lance was a part of numerous escalations of nuclear threat, launched according to Nixon and Wheeler’s decision to initiate a “Show of Force” alert on the 10th of October 1969. This was a series of operations to increase military pressure, including the airborne operation ‘Operation Giant Lance’. Initiated on the 13th of October, Eighteen B-52 bomber aircraft were deployed in preparation for the operation, requiring accompanying KC-135 tankers to refuel and support the extended patrol of the squadron. To prepare for the operation, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) were used to collaboratively deploy the aircraft from air bases both in California and Washington State in secrecy. Further increasing the readiness of the bombers, the aircraft were checked throughout the day, standing by for immediate deployment.  Purpose  The purpose of Operation Giant Lance was to intimidate the foreign contenders in the Vietnam War, primarily the Soviets through a display of radical military escalation. By using seemingly irrational actions as a part of Nixon’s madman diplomacy, he aimed to push both the Soviet and the Vietnamese to end the war on favourable terms. This operation utilised a squadron of eighteen B-52 bomber aircraft which poised an extreme nuclear threat. These bombers were to patrol the Northern polar ice caps to survey the frozen terrain, whilst armed with nuclear weaponry. The patrols consisted of eighteen-hour long vigils, which were executed with the intention of appearing as suspicious movements from the US. These movements were kept as a secret to the public, whilst also remaining intentionally detectable to the Soviet Union’s intelligence systems. The operation was also intended to be a precautionary measure boasting operational readiness in case of military retaliation from either East Asia or Russia. The operation’s intended goal was also to directly support project Duck Hook as a part of the ‘Show of Force’ alert. Nixon believed that this would indirectly coerce Moscow and Hanoi to enter a peace treaty through the Paris peace talks with the Soviets, on terms that were advantageous to the United States. This outcome was also thought to possibly benefit the United States as well by promoting the credibility of the United States intervention in the Sino-Soviet conflict to its general public in the war.  Madman theory  President Richard Nixon was infamous for his radical measures which heavily influenced his diplomatic course of actions. The radicality of sending eighteen armed bombers on patrol stemmed from Nixon’s intention to pressure foreign forces by displaying extreme military prowess. Henry Kissinger, the national security advisor, was advised by Nixon at this time, about Nixon’s willingness to use nuclear weapons in order to end the war. This madman theory attributed president Nixon with a type of diplomacy in which he’d often take irrational options, even to the United States’ own authorities. This perception allows foreign forces to be unable to predict Nixon’s intended motives or whether he will execute his actions, allowing Nixon to have a unique strategic advantage. This diplomacy served as an indirect threat coupled with Nixon’s decision to raise the nuclear alert, as the Soviets would not be able to completely understand his course of action. Nixon used this unpredictable diplomacy to end the war in Vietnam, specifically constructing the impression he was willing to take desperate measures and irrationally threaten enemy forces with the United States’ excessive nuclear threat. This would result in an increased possibility that they may abide by the United States’ demands on the basis that Nixon would declare nuclear warfare if his threats were not complied with. The operations elevating the nuclear threat would also act as a display of Nixon’s reputability as a tough and “mad” leader. This was intended to lead both the North Vietnamese and Soviets that he was indeed an irrational leader, capable of escalating the nuclear threat. Due to Nixon’s history of enacting this diplomacy such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the threat of his “madman” actions served as a real warning as he was socially recognised as a madman figure. This diplomacy was effective during the Vietnam war due to the growing fear over the usage of nuclear warfare, amplified by the numerous ‘Show of Force’ operations. Although this diplomacy could have been passed off to foreign forces as a bluff, the risk of uncertainty to them is much larger than the risk to the United States. Ultimately, Nixon possessed an objective advantage as the US could gouge the effectiveness of their threats based on the reactionary implications of both the Soviets and Vietnamese.  Implications  1969 in international relations 1969 in military history October 1969 events in the United States 1969 in the Soviet Union Military operations of the Vietnam War Nuclear history of the United States Nuclear warfare Soviet Union–United States relations Military operations of the Cold War United States nuclear command and control Presidency of Richard Nixon = Giant Lance's success = The operation did not directly cause any obvious, significant change due to its cancellation; the impact it may have had on the Soviets or the Vietnamese cannot be accurately measured. The operation was terminated on the 30th of October suddenly without any known reason. The abrupt halt to the operation may have been due to the fact that the Soviets did not show any significant changes in their actions, which could be speculated that the Soviets suspected Nixon of his bluffs; thus undermining the overall success of the operation. However, other historians have argued that the sudden withdrawal of the SAC’s squadron was an intentional effort to display the maneuverability and freedom the US possessed when it came to nuclear warfare. Operation Giant Lance would be later revealed to be a tool in terms of escalating the nuclear threat towards the Soviets and North Vietnamese. Giant Lance was intended to jar foreign forces into favourable diplomatic agreements to end the war, before it led to Nixon’s decision to carry out Operation Duck Hook. Despite the operation ending as a bluff tactic, the operation served to add credibility both to Nixon’s madman threats and the proactiveness of the US. Despite this, this may have not amounted to much success due to the large anti-war movement at the time, which served as a large catalyst to the reprieve of the nuclear operations. Seymour Hersh, a modern journalist, believed that the operation also served as an underlying offensive to Operation Duck Hook, in case Nixon decided to carry out the mining and bombing operation. In response to the patrols from Giant Lance, the Soviets showed no clear reactionary actions. Whilst there may not have been a direct response to Operation Giant Lance, there was a reaction from the Soviet intelligence due to the sudden heightened nuclear alert. This was effectively the goal of the operation, to remain publicly secretive but expose the movements purposely to the Soviet intelligence. Moscow did not undertake any steps towards the US despite this. Roger Dingman speculated that whilst the Soviets showed no reaction, the threat and Nixon’s madman diplomacy may have impacted both the decisions of the Soviets and Vietnamese. The lack of any retaliation may be due to Nixon’s history of his bluffs attributed to the madman diplomacy, in which previous nuclear alert threats such as the DEFCON alert initiated during the Cuban Missile Crisis served as a missile scare. In October 1973, a soviet official exclaimed that “Mr. Nixon used to exaggerate his intentions regularly. He used alerts and leaks to do this.”, which may have driven the avoidance of the US operational threat. = Social perception to nuclear warfare = Although both Moscow and Hanoi did not show any reaction or impact of Operation Giant Lance, the uncertainty of Nixon’s nuclear power posed a significant threat. As Nixon was socially recognised as a “madman”, the risk of Nixon’s continuous nuclear threat towards Hanoi was undermined by the anti-war sentiment on US home soil. This implied to Hanoi that the US did not wish for further war, or risk of nuclear warfare. The heightened fear of nuclear warfare brought upon a shared parity of nuclear avoidance across all participants of the war. Neither participant willed a military confrontation that would escalate to that level, exemplifying the significance and extreme measures of Nixon’s “mad” actions in social perceptions at the time. There also existed the political danger of nuclear reliance in terms of war, with increased usage of nuclear weaponry as a threat, other international governments would begin to accept this as the norm. Nuclear fear would bring the possibility of increased nuclear use both offensively and defensively as a means of protecting themselves, engaging or retaliating in military engagements. Continual development of nuclear technology and reliance would inevitably lead to increasing overall paranoia and risk of danger. Military escalation could lead to catastrophic implications, as the presence of nuclear warfare allows for “the threat that leaves something to chance”.

He made nearly 450 appearances in the English and Scottish Football Leagues, representing ten different clubs. Football career Bremner was born in Banff, which is now in Aberdeenshire. He began his senior career as an 18-year-old with home-town club Deveronvale of the Highland League; he had been with the club since he was 14 years of age. In the 1978–79 season, he was part of the team which defeated Huntly to win the Bell's Cup; he finished the season as leading scorer with 27 goals and won the club's player of the year award. Celtic manager Billy McNeill had invited him for a two-week trial, but no contract offer ensued and Bremner left Deveronvale for fellow Highland League club Keith. In October 1980 he moved to England to join Colchester United of the Third Division for a fee of £40,000; that season Colchester were relegated to the Fourth Division. Bremner played more than 100 matches for the club in all competitions, and during the 1982–83 season he spent short periods on loan at Birmingham City, Wrexham and Plymouth Argyle, scoring a goal for each. In February 1983 he joined Millwall for £25,000. His first goal for the club gave him the distinction of having played and scored in the Football League for five different clubs in the same season. Bremner played more than 100 games in all competitions for Millwall, helping them gain promotion to the Second Division as Third Division runners- up. At the beginning of the 1984–85 season he joined Reading; as the clubs were unable to agree on a transfer fee, the Football League tribunal valued his services at £35,000. In his second season at the club, he contributed to Reading winning the Third Division title, before joining Brighton & Hove Albion, where for the third time in four seasons he played his part in his club gaining promotion from the Third Division. He finished the season as the club's leading scorer, with 12 goals in all competitions. He spent a season at Peterborough United before returning to Scotland where he signed for Dundee, contributing to their First Division title in 1991–92. A short spell on loan at Shrewsbury Town preceded his first foray into management, as player-manager of Highland League club Brora Rangers. He then rejoined Deveronvale as player- manager for one season, in which he was leading goalscorer with 17 goals and managed them to victory in the Aberdeenshire Shield. Bremner returned to England to take up a coaching role at Gillingham, where he became youth team manager, but was made redundant in April 2003 along with other staff as a cost-cutting measure. He made one playing appearance for the club in 1995 in a Football League Trophy match. His older brother Des was also a prominent professional footballer, with Hibernian, Aston Villa and Birmingham City.

The ISM was set up in 1882 to promote the importance of music and protect the rights of those working within music. It is an independent, not-for-profit membership organisation which now has over 10,000 individual members and over 160 corporate members. It protects and supports its members by providing them with expert advice, insurance and specialist services as well as access to a community of like-minded professionals and the status that comes with being a member of a professional body. Members of the ISM come from all over the music profession and from a variety of different musical backgrounds. The membership also includes recent graduates and part-time and full-time music students. The ISM also campaigns for the rights of all musicians and in support of the music profession. A survey by the Incorporated Society of Musicians found that 60% of the respondents had experienced sexual harassment.  Members  The ISM has a membership of over 10,000 music professionals including performers, composers, music teachers, music administrators, music technology professionals and portfolio musicians, and provides different levels of membership for students and graduates, orchestras, education bodies and those who are interested in supporting their work. = Notable members = The ISM's current members include Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Mark Elder, Sir James Galway, Dame Felicity Lott, Judith Weir CBE, Suzi Digby OBE, Betty Roe OBE, Julian Lloyd Webber, Julian Bream, Andy Boyd, Paul Harris, John McCabe, Gerald Finley, and Craig Ogden.  Services  The ISM supports its members through expert legal assistance from a specialist in-house legal team and a 24-hour legal and tax helpline, comprehensive insurance including public liability insurance, legal expenses insurance, and discounted musical instrument insurance; practical advice from the ISM's staff team (most of whom are musicians) and access to online advice pages; free promotion through the ISM Music Directory, the UK's only online directory of professional musicians with proven credentials; professional development events including seminars, webinars and conferences; access to a community of like-minded professionals, and financial help from its Members Fund in times of hardship. More benefits of membership can be found on the ISM's website. = Campaigns = In its work to protect musicians' rights and support the profession across the sector, the ISM campaigns and lobbies to make their views known to policy makers.  Bacc for the Future  The ISM led a successful campaign to secure the place of music in the English Baccalaureate as part of a sixth pillar of creative and cultural subjects. The campaign achieved nearly 50,000 signatures to a petition and support from over 110 organisations. On 7 February 2013 the Government withdrew its EBC proposals and introduced a new performance measure for schools that will include creative subjects. In 2015, the campaign was relaunched in response to the Department for Education's proposal to implement the English Baccalaureate as a headline accountability measure in schools. The campaign is supported by 100,000+ individual signatories and over 200 organisations from across the creative industries including Aardman Animations, Shakespeare's Globe, The BRIT School, The Design Council and more. The campaign has recently debated the issue of the EBacc and its exclusion of creative subjects in the Houses of Parliament.  Beyond 1900  In 2014, the Government launched a consultation on the new GCSE, AS and A level in music. While the aims of the reforms were positive, the Government defined only one area of study: ‘music composed in the western classical tradition between 1700 and 1900.’ The ISM stated, 'not only does this artificial time- frame make no musical sense but musicians of the future will only be able to study classical music written before 1700 and after 1900 if they take this as a separate area of study, and the overall effect of the reforms will do little to support and encourage musicality. And it could even have a detrimental effect on musicianship and the study of musical genres.' The ISM subsequently the 'Beyond 1990' campaign, urging the music sector to respond to the consultation]  Protect Music Education  In 2013 the ISM launched the campaign Protect Music Education calling for confirmed funding for music education hubs from 2015, and for the Government to drop its proposal advising local authorities to cease funding music education. It united the music sector, gaining the support of 134 organisations from across the music sector, 5,000 individuals and many distinguished musicians. On 22 July 2014, the campaign was deemed a double success, with £75million of funding for music education in 2015/16 secured, and the Government backing down on its proposal.

It operates Rockwell B-1 Lancer aircraft providing strategic bombing capability. The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 13 June 1917, when the 37th Aero Squadron was organized at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to France as part of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I and served as a training unit until returning to the US for demobilization. It was active in the interwar years at Langley Field, Virginia as a pursuit and attack squadron. The squadron saw combat as the 37th Bombardment Squadron, a Martin B-26 Marauder unit in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations during World War II, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations (DUC) for its performance. It was inactivated after the war's end, although it was briefly active as a paper unit in 1947–1948. The squadron was again activated during the Korean War, when it replaced a reserve unit that was being returned to reserve duty. Flying night intruder missions with Douglas B-26 Invaders, the squadron earned another DUC before the truce in July 1953. In 1955 it returned to the United States and became one of the first jet tactical bomber units, flying Martin B-57 Canberras and Douglas B-66 Destroyers. After a brief deployment to England, the squadron once again inactivated. In 1977, the 37th became part of the Strategic Air Command, flying Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses until 1982. It assumed its present role in 1987. The squadron is an honorary member of the NATO Tiger Association History =World War I = Established on 13 June 1917 at Kelly Field in Texas, the 37th Aero Squadron moved to France in early September. After a short spell at Étampes (18–23 September), it settled at the Issoudun Aerodrome,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. p. 175-176 participating at the installation of the Third Aviation Instruction Center. Once declared operational, it started flight training for newly arrived American pilots and crew members. Reaching Bordeaux c. 6 January 1919, the squadron stayed there until 18 March, when it board a transport to bring it back to the United States where it was demobilized. =Inter-war years= Reactivated at Langley Field, Virginia in September 1933 at as the 37th Pursuit Squadron, the squadron was attached to the 8th Pursuit Group and equipped with Curtiss P-6 Hawks, in March 1935 it became the 37th Attack Squadron with Curtiss A-8 Shrike and Northrop A-17 Nomad attack aircraft. In January 1938, the squadron was inactivated. =World War II= Early operations and training The squadron was redesignated the 37th Bombardment Squadron and activated at Barksdale Field, Louisiana on 1 February 1940 with Douglas B-18 Bolo bombers as one of the original squadrons of the 28th Composite Group, which was training for deployment to Alaska. However, when the 28th Group moved to Alaska in February 1941, the squadron remained in the United States, at Lowry Field, Colorado. In its place, the 73d Bombardment Squadron of the 17th Bombardment Group moved to Alaska in March. The exchange of squadrons was completed in April and May 1941, as the 37th was reassigned to the 17th Group and the 73d to the 28th Group. In June, the squadron moved to Pendleton Field, Oregon and was colocated with its parent group for the first time since the squadron's 1940 activation.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 175–176, 268; Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 61–63, 80 At Pendleton, the squadron transitioned into the North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 37th flew antisubmarine patrols off the Pacific coast until about March 1942. Because the 17th Group was the first Army Air Forces unit to equip with the Mitchell, the squadron, along with the other squadrons of the 17th Group contributed aircrews for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, Japan on 6 April 1942. After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the squadron flew antisubmarine patrols over the Northwest Pacific coast until May 1942.

In June 1942, the squadron returned to Barksdale Field, where it began transitioning into the Martin B-26 Marauder. Following Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa in November 1942, the squadron moved to Algeria, where it began combat operations on 30 December. The squadron flew interdiction and close air support missions, contributing to the defeat of Axis forces in Africa by May 1943. In June 1943, the squadron conducted bombing attacks leading to the surrender of enemy forces in Pantelleria and Lampedusa. The squadron participated in Operations Husky and Avalanche as the Allies moved into Sicily and Italy.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 61–63 During the Allied drive toward Rome, the squadron was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for an attack on airfields near Rome on 13 January 1944. Its operations in Italy between April and June 1944 earned it the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. In August 1944, the squadron bombed targets to support Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. The squadron continued operations through the remainder of the year. Shortly before the end of the war, on 10 April 1945, the squadron participated in an attack on Schweinfurt, Germany, for which it received a second DUC. Following V-E Day, the squadron participated in disarming German forces. In November 1945, it returned to the United States and was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation. =Korean War= Glass nosed B-26 Invaders in Korea The squadron was reactivated in May 1947 by Tactical Air Command but it was not manned or equipped. It was inactivated in September 1948. The squadron was activated at Pusan East Air Base, Korea on 10 May 1952, when it assumed the mission, personnel and Douglas B-26 Invaders of the 729th Bombardment Squadron. The 729th was a reserve unit that had been called to active duty for the Korean War and was being returned to reserve status.Endicott, USAF in Korea, p. 70 The squadron continued the night bombing operations of the 729th, concentrating on attacks on enemy lines of communication and troop concentrations. In 1953, the squadron focused on attacking rail rolling stock, facilities and supplies. Using Invaders with glass noses,Some of the unit's B-26s had solid noses with machine guns mounted in them. the squadron developed techniques for conducting armed reconnaissance missions against locomotives and freight cars and began flying missions employing these tactics in February 1953. It participated in Operation Spring Thaw and starting in March, attacked southbound routes along the East Coast of North Korea. It continued operations until the July 1953 truce, and was awarded its third DUC for its operations.Endicott, USAF in Korea, pp. 68–69 The 37th remained in Korea as a precaution against the resumption of hostilities. In September 1954, it relocated to Miho Air Base, Japan, It remained in Japan until the spring of 1955, when it returned to the United States for conversion to jet bombers. =Tactical jet bomber operations= Martin B-57A USAF 52-1418 Re- equipped with Martin B-57 Canberra jet bombers and conducted evaluation testing of the aircraft at Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field No. 9; transitioned to Douglas B-66B Destroyers in 1956, the first squadron to receive the new tactical bomber. Deployed to RAF Sculthorpe, England briefly in 1958 before returning to Eglin and performing more testing on B-66s with Jet Assisted Take Off (JATO) and until being inactivated later in the year. =Strategic bombardment operations= Boeing B-52H Last mission 23 January 2010 The squadron joined the 28th Bombardment Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, becoming the wing's second Boeing B-52H Stratofortress squadron on 1 January 1977. The squadron continued to fly the \\"Buff\\" until October 1982, when it was inactivated. On 1 January 1987, the squadron activated and transitioned to its current aircraft, the Rockwell B-1B Lancer. Along with all other active bomber units in the air force it changed its name and became the 37th Bomb Squadron on 1 September 1991. In December 1998, it became the first unit to employ the B-1 in combat in support of Operation Desert Fox in Iraq. One year later, crews from the squadron supported Operation Allied Force and flew combat operations in Kosovo and Serbia. Since the 9/11 attacks, the 37th and its sister squadron at Ellsworth, the 34th Bomb Squadron have joined to provide aircraft and crews to form expeditionary units. These expeditionary units have flown missions contributing to the effort to drive the Taliban from Afghanistan. During this time, the combined squadrons flew 5 percent of the strike missions but released nearly 40 percent of the total bomb tonnage—more than 1,730 tons. Its personnel have also employed the B-1 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, including a strike against high priority leadership targets in Baghdad. In 2007, the 37th began regular deployments to the Middle East, rotating with other B-1 units, with one year at home station followed by six months deployed. On average squadron members fly over 6,000 combat hours and more than 500 combat sorties per deployment. Squadron personnel supported Libya strike missions during Operation Odyssey Dawn, the first B-1 combat mission launched from the United States to strike overseas targets.

The protagonists' target is a nearby research station observing the event. Despite the supernova being located lightyears from the mission area, its intense radiation is highly dangerous to ships wandering outside the dust banks. *In the Star Trek universe, trilithium-based weapons can cause stars to go supernova by inhibiting their fusion processes. *In the Star Wars universe, the Sun Crusher can cause stars to go supernova with its resonance torpedoes. In addition, Centerpoint Station can cause supernovae. *In the mythos of the comic book character Superman, his home planet of Krypton is destroyed. Some interpretations of this origin story, such as the 2006 film Superman Returns depict the destruction of Krypton as being caused by its sun (identified in the comics by the name Rao) going supernova. *In the Justice League Unlimited episode Patriot Act, many League members are away trying to prevent or smother a supernova explosion threatening a distant star system. *In the 2000 film Supernova, the crew of the Nightingale is threatened by a blue giant that can explode at any moment; the star is later destroyed, but by a 9th-dimensional bomb rather than a supernova. *The 2005 film Supernova deals with the possibility of the Sun exploding. *The 2009 direct-to-video film 2012: Supernova is about life on Earth potentially being destroyed by a nearby supernova. *The Futurama episode Roswell That Ends Well involves the main characters being sent back in time after radiation from a nearby supernova interacts with radiation produced by metal being heated in the ship's microwave. *The Algae Planet in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series is destroyed by its star going nova. *In the PC-game FreeSpace 2, the crucial Battle of Capella ends in the explosion of the star in a supernova. *The French cartoon Once Upon a Time... Space has one episode in which the protagonists must help to evacuate a planet near of a star that has gone supernova. *In Antonella Gambotto-Burke's novel The Pure Weight of the Heart, Angelica, the protagonist, gets stoned with William Grieve, the famous novelist, and says: “The first known galactic supernovae were seen in - were seen in Lupus in 1006. And . . . then . . . in, um . . . in 1054 in Taurus . . . and then in . . . was it 1572 or 1575? One or the other. At any rate, they were observed in Cassiopeia. And then . . . then . . . um, then . . . did I mention Taurus? I did? Excellent. But there were more. More Supernovae. More supernovae in Serpens. Fifteenth century. Which is interesting. I think so, don’t you? Because I do. Think so. Supernovae in Serpens. Supernovae everywhere.” Grieve narrows his eyes and replies: “No supernovae in here.” As Angelica is an astrophysicist, there are mentions of supernovae throughout the book.The Pure Weight of the Heart, Orion Publishing, London, 1999 * In the Star Trek: Voyager episode The Q and the Grey, several stars had exploded within days of each other. It later turned out that this was caused by the Q Civil War. * In the Star Trek episode All Our Yesterdays, the Enterprise attempts to evacuate a planet before its sun becomes a supernova. *In the Stargate SG-1 season two episode \\"A Matter of Time\\", SG-10 travelled to the planet P3W-451, observing a binary star where one of the stars is an active supernova. As they were watching, the supernova collapsed into a black hole dangerously close to the planet, the team being stranded by time dilation. **In the season four closer \\"Exodus\\" the team, working with the Tok'ra, force a star to go nova. They do this by dialing a Stargate to P3W-451 and sending the gate into the star, protected by a force field. When the Stargate entered the star in question, the shield collapsed, and a good deal of stellar matter was sucked through the gate, disrupting the star and forcing it to nova. The Supernova affected the hyperspace windows of escaping ships in such a way that they accelerated out of control and emerged four million light-years away. *There is also a short story, ASOV, from the 1960s, which tells the story of an Automated (or Automatic) Stellar Observation Vehicle (hence the name ASOV). One of thousand of millions produced by civilisations strung throughout the galaxy, it observes stars, sending data back 'home'. A chance hit from a passing rock disables 'our' ASOV. It drifts, seemingly for ever, for aeons at least, to a time when the galaxy is clearly dying; ASOV is re-awakened by the energy of a nearby supernova. The story, written by James Inglis, was reprinted as \\"Night Watch\\" in the anthology Space Odysseys edited by Brian Aldiss. * In the 2009 movie Star Trek, a supernova (depicted as a hypernova) destroys the Romulan home planet. * The Christopher Rowley novel Starhammer sees the Laowon Empire brought to its knees with the said weapon which induces a supernova. * In the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, Johnny Storm, the Human Torch, is said to create temperatures near to those measured in supernovae. * In the 1952 novel The Currents of Space by Isaac Asimov, a scientist is assaulted when he predicts that a star will go supernova. Although the orbiting planet Florinia is inhabited, it is also an important source of raw materials. A humanitarian crisis is averted when the colonial powers are persuaded to evacuate the planet. * In the 2002 Disney film Treasure Planet, the crew of the Legacy encounters a supernova on their travels, as well as the resulting black hole. During the supernova, Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) saves the life of Long John Silver (Brian Murray) when he falls overboard. * In the Poul Anderson short story \\"Supernova\\" (original title: \\"Day of Burning\\"), part of his Technic History sequence, published in Analog science- fiction magazine in January 1967 with a Chesley Bonestell cover illustration, the homeworld of the reptilian Merseians is threatened by a nearby supernova. David Falkayn, of the Solar Spice and Liquors Company, negotiates a trade deal that provides them with the technology to survive the event, but also overturns their social structures. The Merseians do not forget, and figure prominently as inveterate enemies of the Terran empire in the Dominic Flandry stories, later in the sequence. * In the Arthur C.

It is based on the children's book Lauras Stern by Klaus Baumgart. It was released by the German distribution unit of Warner Bros. Pictures, and one of the final known theatrical films to officially be released through the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label (WBFE's final film overall was 2007's Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale, which was direct-to- video). Plot Laura is a seven-year-old country girl, who just moved along with her family to a big city. On her first night in her new neighborhood, she sees a shooting star falling to Earth. Laura finds the star in a park and discovers that it is a living being. The star had severed one of its points during its crash landing. Laura takes the star back home, in order to reattach its point with a band-aid. Laura and her younger brother Tommy discover the little star has super powers and can do amazing things; like making people fly and bringing inanimate objects to life. But over time both notice that the longer the star stays on Earth, the weaker it becomes. (Its color is gradually fading while its powers fail.) The siblings and their next-door neighbor Max eventually find a way to send the little star back into outer space.

He was sentenced in 2008 to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. Doubts have since been raised about his conviction by, among others, retired Professor Vincent Marks, an expert on insulin poisoning. Crimes Norris worked at Leeds General Infirmary and St James's Hospital. Suspicions were raised when Norris predicted the death of one patient, Ethel Halls, saying she would die at 5:15 am. Her condition worsened badly that morning around 5am and she died some weeks later. He stated at the time: \\"it is always in the morning when things go wrong\\". When questioned by police about this and three other patients who had died while he was on duty, he said \\"he seemed to have been unlucky over the last 12 months\\". The four patients were 79, 80, 86 and 88 years old. The police investigated 72 cases in total. Trial The trial, at Newcastle Crown Court, took 19 weeks and the jury deliberated for four days. Norris was convicted, by a majority verdict, on 3 March 2008, of the murder of four women, and the attempted murder of a fifth aged 90. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and ordered to serve a minimum term of 30 years in prison the following day. Judge Mr Justice Griffith rejected any possibility that Norris was practising euthanasia because none of the victims was terminally ill. He told Norris when sentencing: > \\"You are, I have absolutely no doubt, a thoroughly evil and dangerous man. > You are an arrogant and manipulative man with a real dislike of elderly > patients. The most telling evidence was that observation of one of your > patients, Bridget Tarpey, who said 'he did not like us old women'.\\" Referred to in the British press as the \\"Angel of Death\\", Norris was convicted of killing his victims by injecting them with high levels of insulin. Jessie McTavish, a nurse convicted and then cleared in 1974 for the murder of an 80-year-old patient with insulin, has been identified as a possible inspiration for Norris. He once attended a lecture on her case while studying at university. Concerns over the conviction On 4 October 2011 new concerns were raised about the safety of Norris' conviction. Retired Professor Vincent Marks – a leading expert on insulin poisoning – said the jury at Norris' trial was led to believe by experts that a cluster of hypoglycaemic episodes, among people who were not diabetic, was sinister. The professor said international medical studies carried out in the years since the 35-year-old Glaswegian was convicted told a different story. \\"Looking at all the evidence, all I can say is I think Colin Norris' conviction is unsafe,\\" he said. Prof Marks says the four patients picked out by the experts after Mrs Hall's death \\"were all at very high risk of developing spontaneous hypoglycaemia\\" because they had risk factors such as malnutrition, infection and multi-organ failure. Legal observers have noted that, if the medical evidence is discredited, then the case against Norris collapses, there being little motive and no forensic evidence linking him to the crimes. In 2011 former Rough Justice producer Louise Shorter and journalist Mark Daly produced the documentary A Jury in the Dark, arguing that there were logical, non-criminal explanations for all the deaths. During research for the film, Daly states he discovered an additional death at Leeds General Infirmary which police had initially been investigating as a potential murder carried out by a male nurse, however; the death \\"went from suspicious to non-suspicious\\", when police learned that Norris was not on duty at the time. In May 2013 the Criminal Cases Review Commission confirmed it was re-examining the case in the light of new medical and scientific evidence contradictory to that submitted to the jury during the original trial. In January 2015 the foreman of the jury that convicted Norris told the BBC that he now believes him to be innocent; apparently the second member of the jury to do so. Similar cases In the aftermath of Norris' conviction, the British media drew comparisons with Harold Shipman, Britain's most prolific serial killer who killed more than 250 patients by lethal injections. Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Gregg, who worked on the Shipman case and led the Norris investigation, was convinced that Colin Norris would have gone on to kill considerably more people if he had not been stopped in his tracks. In 2006 Benjamin Geen, a nurse at a hospital in Banbury, Oxfordshire, was given 17 life sentences for murdering two of his patients and attacking 15 others. He allegedly used a variety of injections which often included insulin, but his case is also controversial.

He was one of the discoverers of the Elephantine Papyri. He produced the first English translation of Les Misérables. Biography The Dahabiyeh, \\"The Seven Hathors\\" 1800s. Brooklyn Museum Wilbour used his houseboat, named “The Seven Hathors,” as a place to entertain his fellow Egyptologists, family and friends. He was born in Little Compton, Rhode Island, on March 17, 1833. He received a classical education and entered Brown University, where he took a prize for proficiency in Greek and was noted for his thorough acquaintance with the ancient and modern languages, but was not graduated, owing to delicate health. Having taught himself shorthand, when he had sufficiently recovered, he went to New York City in 1854 and became connected with the Tribune as a reporter. He also studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1859. The following eighteen years were devoted to literary and journalistic work. In 1872, he began the study of Egyptian antiquities and visited the principal libraries of the United States and Canada. Wilbour also owned a major paper manufacturing company, which eventually involved him in the events leading to his voluntary self-exile. He obtained many city contracts apparently dealing with Tammany Hall in the heyday of the Tweed Ring. With the fall of William M. Tweed in the early 1870s, Wilbour decided to leave the United States. In 1874, he went abroad and spent much time consulting the archaeological treasures of the British Museum and the great libraries of the continent. He then became a co-laborer with Heinrich Karl Brugsch and Gaston Camille Charles Maspero in the field of Egyptology, accompanying the latter on five winter exploring expeditions up the Nile. Wilbour spent his winters in Egypt, working at sites throughout the country from 1880 until his death in 1896. Wilbour travelled from site to site by train, postal steamer, or hitching a lift on the steamer belonging to the Department of Antiquities. By the time of his visit in 1886, however, he had decided to buy a dahabiya (houseboat), which would accommodate him, his visiting family, and his library in greater comfort. On a visit to Aswan he purchased some papyri dug up on the island of Elephantine by local people. He did not realise the importance of his find and when he died in a hotel in Paris his belongings, including the papyri (among these the Brooklyn Papyrus, the Wilbour Papyrus and the Elephantine Papyri), were put in storage by the hotel and not returned to his family for nearly half a century. At the request of his widow, they were donated to the Brooklyn Museum. Wilbour published \\"Rachel in the New World\\", from the French of Léon Beauvallet, with John W. Palmer (New York, 1856); and translated Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862–1863); he also published The Life of Jesus, from the French of Ernest Renan (1863). His wife, Charlotte Beebe, was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on March 2, 1830, was educated in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, and married Mr. Wilbour on January 18, 1858. She was elected president of Sorosis in 1870 and five times re-elected. She was a founder of the club, devoted much time and thought to securing for it a permanent foundation, and was instrumental in organizing the Association for the Advancement of Women that was formed by it in 1873. She instituted lectures on health and dress reform, suggested and aided in preparing entertainments for various purposes, and assisted many women in obtaining public recognition. Despite living outside America, she maintained her interest in the elevation of her sex and sought every opportunity to labour for it. Legacy Wilbour Hall at Brown University The Wilbour Plaque, ca. 1352-1336 B.C.E. The Wilbour Plaque is named for the early American Egyptologist Charles Edwin Wilbour (1833–1896), who acquired it in Egypt in 1881. The small slab is not part of a larger scene but complete as it was made. It was intended as a sculptor's model, to be studied and imitated by students and beginning artists. Brooklyn Museum The Wilbour Library of Egyptology in the Brooklyn Museum is named for him as is Wilbour Hall and the Charles Edwin Wilbour Professorship at Brown University. In 1916, the children of Charles E. Wilbour donated Wilbour’s collection of objects, his Egyptological library, and personal papers to the Brooklyn Museum. In 1932, the bequest of Victor Wilbour, the only son of Charles and Charlotte Wilbour, established the Charles Edwin Wilbour Fund. The purpose of this endowment was to financially assist in the purchasing of objects for the Museum’s Egyptian collection, support curatorial staff, and establish the Wilbour Library of Egyptology. As a result of the creation of this endowment, the Brooklyn Museum appointed Jean Capart (1877-1947) as Honorary Curator of Egyptology. Capart was one of the first individuals to realize the scholarly value of Wilbour’s papers. In 1936, Capart published Travels in Egypt, which contains Wilbour’s letters regarding his expeditions. Shortly after the publication of these letters, the Department of Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Middle Eastern Art (ECAMEA) employed Walter Federn (1910-1967) “to classify the extensive collection of papers belonging to Charles Edwin Wilbour.” An additional collection of Wilbour family correspondence can be found in Special Collections at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. These include a file of letters between Charles Wilbour's wife, Charlotte, and noted Suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Isabella Beecher Hooker, among others. The Wilbour Archival Collection The Wilbour Archival Collection documents the research and expeditions of Charles Edwin Wilbour (1833-1896), one of the first American Egyptologists. This collection includes a wide variety of materials such as articles, letters, inscriptions, notebooks, notes, publications, squeezes, bookplates, maps, and photographs. The bulk of the collection housed at the Brooklyn Museum consists of Wilbour’s letters, notebooks, and research notes. He wrote numerous detailed letters to his wife, Charlotte Beebe Wilbour, and his mother, Sarah Soule Wilbour, describing both ancient and nineteenth century Egypt. These letters also document some of the objects purchased by Wilbour that are currently found in the Brooklyn Museum. Jean Capart later published these letters in 1936 in his book Travels in Egypt. In addition, there are letters to Wilbour from renowned Egyptologists such as August Eisenlohr, Jan Herman Insigner, Gaston Maspero, A.H. Sayce, Heinrich Karl Brugsch, and W.M. Flinders Petrie regarding their research and publications. In addition to his letters, Wilbour’s research notes and notebooks offer insight into his work and provide detailed accounts of his observations and travels. Additional items of interest are inscriptions that Wilbour copied directly from sites or publications, and copies of published inscriptions with his hand-written annotations. Of particular interest are Wilbour’s hand written copies from inscriptions located in the Temple of Ombos, which reflect his meticulousness and attention to detail. In addition, the squeezes and photographs visually document objects and sites he visited. Of particular interest is a collection of squeezes that provide impressions of inscriptions found on an unidentified sarcophagus. Not only do the photographs provide visual documentation of Wilbour’s research, but they also illustrate various monuments in Aswan and other locations. The Wilbour Library of Egyptology today is one of the world’s most comprehensive research libraries for the study of ancient Egypt. The nucleus of the collection comes from the personal library of Charles Edwin Wilbour, an American Egyptologist who also assembled the Museum’s extensive Egyptian antiquities collection. With over 35,000 volumes, the Wilbour Library is an important resource for textual and visual information about the history of ancient Egypt. It also holds material on art and culture of the ancient Middle East. Notes References * Wilbour, Charles E. Travels in Egypt: Letters of Charles Edwin Wilbour. Edited by Jean Capart.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 1 April 2008. Reese- Williams announced her departure from the show on 12 May 2013 and she made her last appearance as Gennie on 26 July 2013. Her main storylines have focused on getting to know her family, the Dingles, which includes her birth father Shadrach Dingle (Andy Devine), developing unrequited feelings for Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) and Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw ), her relationship with Jamie Hope (Alex Carter), her relationship and subsequent marriage to Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) and being murdered by Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) after being involved in a car accident with him and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). Creation and development Gennie Walker was created while Kathleen Beedles was the series producer. By the time her first episode aired on 1 April 2008, Anita Turner had taken over from Beedles. Theatre actress Sian Reese-Williams was cast in the role and started filming in the week beginning 3 March 2008. The character was described as \\"not your typical Dingle\\" and Turner said that \\"we’ve got some exciting storylines planned\\" with Gennie in \\"for a real culture shock when she meets her biological family\\". In an interview in May 2008, Anita Turner said that \\"the character [Gennie] could be brilliant and it's about her finding that inner Dingle\\". Turner said that Gennie has \\"really hidden depths – it’s more about her future in Emmerdale, rather than her past\\". On 12 May 2013, it was announced that Reese-Williams was leaving Emmerdale. The actress stated \\"I have absolutely adored my five years playing Gennie and being part of such an iconic show. My decision to leave has nothing to do with Emmerdale - it's such a special place and I will always cherish it - but I feel it's the right time for me to say goodbye and find new challenges.\\" On 25 July 2013, Gennie was killed off when Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) suffocated her following a car accident. Details of the murder were kept a secret to ensure viewers would be surprised. She made her final appearance on 26 July 2013. Storylines Gennie is accidentally knocked off her motorbike by Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) while on her way to meet her biological father Shadrach Dingle (Andy Devine). She recovers in hospital and becomes friends with Ross and his cousin Paddy (Dominic Brunt), when they visit her in hospital. Paddy invites her to Eli Dingle's (Joseph Gilgun) 28th birthday party, and while she is there, Gennie meets Shadrach and realises that she has found her father and she later reluctantly talks to Shadrach. He tells how he started looking for her after his godson Daniel Thomas died of sudden infant death syndrome. Shadrach had planned to leave his wife for Gennie's mother, Shirley Pascoe, but she died in childbirth. Feeling unable to take her home, he gave her up for adoption. Gennie soon becomes close to her father and his family, although her half-sister Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) is initially resentful of her presence and the attention she gets from Shadrach. Gennie tries to prove she is a true Dingle, and finally does so when she steals a client from Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell), making money in the process. She also helps Eli and their cousin Sam (James Hooton) burn down Pollard's factory. After growing close to Eli, they share a kiss but he tells her that he is not attracted to her and she insists she isn't attracted to him. Soon, Gennie moves in with the Dingles, which upsets her adoptive mother, Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop), who is concerned about Gennie not having a job and her change in character. Chas convinces Brenda that Gennie is working at the vets, and for a short time, she does work there. On her way to a call out, Gennie runs over and kills a sheep. She and Eli are arrested for stealing the vet’s drugs, but are released when the locum vet, Josh, explains that she was taking the drugs to the farm. After this incident, her mother again tries to persuade her to come home, but Gennie refuses, saying she felt she like she fitted in with the Dingles. Gennie gets a job as a machinist at Eric Pollard’s new factory, while Brenda starts working for Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw) at the village post office and cafe. Gennie is not happy with this as it means Brenda would visit more often. She then becomes close to many local residents and eventually starts to tolerate her mother's presence. Gennie becomes concerned that Brenda is falling for Bob while his wife Viv (Deena Payne) is in prison and Gennie convinces Brenda to start dating Terry Woods (Billy Hartman) instead. Brenda and Gennie move into the vacant flat above the post office. Gennie joins the church choir after Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) hears her beautiful singing voice. Gennie is nervous about singing in front of other people, especially when she learns they would be entering a choir competition to help stop the church being closed as she was only comfortable singing when she was alone. They agreed that Gennie would stand offstage whilst Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) mimes to Gennie's voice, but at the event, Gennie is forced to take center stage. They win a prize, but afterwards, Gennie is still too self-conscious to sing in front of anyone else. Gennie develops feelings for Paddy, and Chas encourages her, even though she knows Paddy is more interested in her. Gennie sends him a Valentine's Day card, but Paddy thinks someone is making fun of him. Soon, Paddy and Chas get together and Gennie is hurt by her sister's actions. After Gennie tells her nephew, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), that Bob is due to give a large sum of money to his cash and carry firm, Aaron, Gennie's uncle Zak (Steve Halliwell), and Shadrach steal it to pay for repairs to Debbie Dingle's (Charley Webb) house. Bob's reputation is damaged as he is accused of stealing the money and he blames Brenda for distracting the delivery man and they have a bitter quarrel. Gennie soon realises the truth and begs her family to give the money back. They refuse and Gennie is horrified that no one agrees with her, not even her father, but they patch up their differences a few weeks later. Gennie develops a crush on Bob, despite the fact he is married. They become close when Brenda moves in with Terry and Bob and his twins move into the flat with Gennie. Bob is shocked when he learns of Gennie's feelings, who attempts to involve herself with other men to move on. However, they later sleep together and are shocked when Viv returns. Gennie gets a job at the Sharma sweet factory and begins seeing Bob's son, Jamie (Alex Carter). Gennie and Jamie decide to move to Newquay when they are both offered new jobs. At their leaving party, Bob bids farewell to Gennie and kisses her on the forehead, which Jamie sees. Jamie accuses them of restarting their affair and tells Viv about it. Jamie tells Gennie that he loves her, but is not sure he can trust her and he leaves for Newquay. Viv slaps Gennie for cheating withis racked with guilt that she never settled to naming him her father. Gennie is promoted to PA at Sharma Sharma, but is offended when she learns that Jai (Chris Bisson) and Nikhil (Rik Makarem) chose her because Jai was unlikely to want to have sex with her. Gennie becomes interested in Nikhil and is jealous when he starts seeing Chas. Gennie tells Chas about her crush on Nikhil, which leads to a scuffle. However, Chas dumps Nikhil for Gennie's sake. When Gennie finally confesses her love for Nikhil to him, he rejects her. Gennie later begins dating local vet Nicky Pritchard (Matt Milburn), which makes Nikhil jealous. He fights with Nicky and Gennie tells him to stay away from them. When Nikhil spots Nicky with another woman, he assumes that he is having an affair. However, Nicky explains that he was trying to get Gennie another job. Nikhil declares his love for Gennie and apologises for his behaviour. Gennie forgives him and they share a passionate kiss. Gennie soon decides to be with Nikhil and splits with Nicky, who leaves the village. When Gennie discovers that she is 18 weeks pregnant, she is afraid to tell Nikhil. When Gennie eventually works up the courage to tell Nikhil, he assumes from her behaviour that she is finishing with him. He breaks up with her first, but Charity tells him that Gennie is pregnant and Nikhil apologises to her. Nikhil proposes to Gennie and she accepts. When Nikhil reveals that he knows about the baby, Gennie assumes that it was the only reason he proposed. Nikhil assures her it was not and pledges his love to her and the baby. Gennie gives birth to a daughter at Chas's wedding reception and she and Nikhil name her Molly. Gennie is devastated when Brenda is diagnosed with a brain tumour and she refuses treatment. Gennie and Nikhil bring the date of their wedding forward because of Brenda's illness, which angers Brenda. She refuses to have the surgery or attend the wedding. On the day of the wedding day, Gennie explains that she cannot get married without her mother there. Brenda eventually turns up, but she soon collapses and suffers a seizure. Brenda agrees to have surgery, which is successful. Gennie later helps Brenda shave her hair off and arrange a hand fasting ceremony with Bob. When Gennie suspects Chas's fiancé, Cameron Murray, is having an affair with Debbie, she hides in Debbie's house to catch them out. Gennie records a conversation between Cameron and Debbie whilst sitting at the top of their stairs, in which Cameron admits to killing Carl King (Tom Lister). Cameron and Debbie witness Gennie leaving the house and they give chase when Gennie gets in her car and drives off. Being a new driver, Gennie panics and starts speeding. She loses control of the car plunges down a steep ravine. Gennie survives the crash and Cameron pulls her out of the wreckage. While Debbie is calling an ambulance, Gennie begs Cameron not to hurt her, but he suffocates her in order to keep his secret. Debbie is devastated when she sees Gennie is dead and believes she and Cameron are both responsible for her death. When the police and paramedics arrive, Debbie tells them that she saw the accident scene while driving by. Nikhil, Brenda, Bob and Chas are devastated when they learn Gennie has died. Nikhil and Molly return to the village in October 2015. After seeing Debbie in the Woolpack, he is angry and upset and insults her as he believes she caused Gennie's death. Gennie's sister Chas tells him that Debbie suffered just as much from what Cameron did. However, he is later punched by Debbie's boyfriend Ross Barton (Michael Parr).

Her work has appeared in the Paj Ntaub Voice Hmong literary journal, \\"Waterstone~Review,\\" and other publications. She is a contributing writer to On Being's Public Theology Reimagined blog. Additionally, Yang wrote the lyric documentary, The Place Where We Were Born. Yang currently resides in St. Paul, Minnesota. Early life Born in Ban Vinai Refugee Camp in December, 1981, Yang came to Minnesota in the summer of 1987, along with her parents and older sister Dawb. Yang says that the move to America was necessary for her parents. Her mother suffered six miscarriages after giving birth to her, and with no male heir, her father was being pressured to find a second wife. He even took his younger daughter on trips with him to visit eligible women in the camp. For Yang's parents, leaving Ban Vinai was not only about finding opportunity for their two daughters, but also rescuing themselves from family and cultural pressure. Yang says that while her sister mastered the English language quickly, she struggled for many years, finally discovering that her gift lay not in the spoken, but in the written word. Yang credits her older sister Dawb, with awakening an interest within her: Yang also credits her 9th grade English teacher, Mrs. Gallatin, with recognizing and encouraging her talents. Upon graduation from Harding High School, she attended Carleton College, though she was by no means certain of her future plans when she began her college career. Education Yang graduated from Carleton College in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in American Studies, Women's and Gender Studies, and Cross-cultural Studies. Yang received her Master's of Fine Arts in Creative Nonfiction Writing from Columbia University in New York City. Her graduate studies were supported by a Dean's Fellowship from the School of the Arts and The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. Yang is a natural teacher. Beginning at age 12, Yang taught English as a second language to adult refugees. As a student, Yang privately tutored students, and taught creative nonfiction writing workshops to professionals, including professors from Rutgers University and New York University. Yang has also taught the fundamentals of writing to students at Concordia University in St. Paul and courses in composition at St. Catherine University. She was a professor in the English department at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire for the 2010-2011 academic year. In 2014, Yang served as a mentor for the Loft Mentor Series. She taught at North Hennepin Community College in 2015 as visiting faculty in the English Department. Recently, Yang was the Benedict Distinguished Visiting Faculty in American Studies and English at Carleton College. Published Works Kao Kalia Yang has continued to write and publish since her release of The Latehomecomer: A Hmong Family Memoir in 2008. Yang then wrote and published The Song Poet: A Memoir of My Father on May 10, 2016. Yang also debuted a children's book A Map Into the World in 2019. Besides writing, Yang also co-edited What God is Honored Here? in 2019 describing experiences of miscarriage from indigenous women and women of color. Yang also has future works to be released in the upcoming years. Awards and Recognition Kao Kalia Yang has been a recipient of the Alan Page Scholarship, the Gilman International Award, and the Freeman in Asia Scholarship. Yang was a Columbia University's School of the Arts Dean's fellow, a Paul and Daisy Soros fellow, and a McKnight Arts fellow. Yang won the 2005 Lantern Book's essay contest for an essay titled \\"To the Men In My Family Who Love Chickens.\\" In 2008, Carleton College awarded her with the Spirit of Carleton College Award. Yang has been the recipient of several Minnesota State Arts Board artist grants. In 2009 her first book The Latehomecomer won Minnesota Book Awards for memoir/creative nonfiction as well as the Reader's Choice Award—the first book to ever win two awards in the same year. The book was a finalist for a PEN USA Literary Center Award and an Asian American Literary Award. The book remains a bestselling title for Coffee House Press. \\"The Latehomecomer\\" is a National Endowment of the Arts' Big Read book. Yang's second book, The Song Poet, is the winner of the 2017 MN Book Award in Creative Nonfiction/Memoir. It was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Chautauqua Prize. The book is now a finalist for a PEN USA literary award in nonfiction and the Dayton's Literary Peace Prize. In 2020 Yang's children's book A Map into the World, illustrated by Seo Kim, received a Charlotte Zolotow Award Honor for outstanding writing in a picture book. Controversies On September 24, 2012, Radiolab aired a segment on yellow rain and the Hmong people, during which Robert Krulwich interviewed Yang and her uncle Eng Yang. During the two-hour interview, of which less than five minutes was aired, Yang was brought to the point of tears over \\"Robert's harsh dismissal of my uncle's experience.\\" Following a public outcry, Krulwich issued an apology on September 30 writing, \\"I now can hear that my tone was oddly angry. That's not acceptable -- especially when talking to a man who has suffered through a nightmare in Southeast Asia that was beyond horrific.\\" The podcast itself was later amended on October 5, and according to Yang \\"On October 7, I received an email from Dean Cappello, the Chief Content Officer at WNYC, notifying me that Radiolab had once more \\"amended\\" the Yellow Rain podcast so that Robert could apologize at the end, specifically to Uncle Eng for the harshness of his tone and to me for saying that I was trying to \\"monopolize\\" the conversation. I listened to the doctored version. In addition to Robert's apologies—which completely failed to acknowledge the dismissal of our voices and the racism that transpired/s -- Radiolab had simply re- contextualized their position, taken out the laughter at the end, and \\"cleaned\\" away incriminating evidence.\\" Yang noted in particular: \\"Everybody in the show had a name, a profession, institutional affiliation except Eng Yang, who was identified as \\"Hmong guy,\\" and me, \\"his niece.\\" The fact that I am an award-winning writer was ignored. The fact that my uncle was an official radio man and documenter of the Hmong experience to the Thai government during the war was absent.\\" This incident stirred up issues of white privilege, with many accusing Radiolab and Krulwich of being insensitive to racial matters.

Built in 1823, it is a virtually unaltered work of the noted early American architect Robert Mills, and reflects innovative changes in jail design promoted by him. It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973. and Description and history The old Lancaster County Jail is located in downtown Lancaster, on the north side of West Gay Street, between South French and South Catawba Streets. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brick covered with stucco, with stone trim elements and a gabled roof. Its main facade faces east, with the entrance and first-floor windows set in round-arched recesses. Stone string courses separate the floors, and stone quoining is found at the building corners. The sills and lintels of the windows are also of stone. The interior of the first floor has a barrel- vaulted brick ceiling, and has a hallway down the center, separating the jailer's living quarters on one side from debtor's cells on the other. The doors are made of heavy wooden planking with three-foot hinges. A stairway leads to the second floor, which has a series of barred cages at its center. The stairway is protected by heavy doors at the top and bottom. The jail was built in 1823, and is almost certainly the work of Robert Mills, who was from 1820-30 a member of the state board of public works, and is generally credited with having designed virtually all of the state's public architecture built in that time. Mills was an advocate of reform in prison conditions, including the improvement of air circulation in the cell blocks, and the separation of criminals and debtors from each other. He also called for the jailer's quarters to be placed where the major features of the jail could be monitored; all of these features are found in the building, and the barrel-vaulted first- floor ceiling is also a Mills hallmark.

A major renovation, , added a late Georgian and Federal finish, as well as front and rear shed porches. A brick well house and a frame smokehouse, both east of the house, date from the 19th century. Almost nine acres (36,000 m²), with several large walnut trees, surround the buildings..  Hoyle family  Pieter Heyl, a miller from Adenbach, Germany, his wife, Catharine, and their children arrived in America on September 11, 1738 on the Robert and Alice, originally settling in northeast Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Heyl family, later Anglicized to Hoyle, then lived for some time in Frederick, Maryland, but by 1753 had moved to what is now Gaston County, North Carolina, then part of Anson County. Peter Hoyle died prior to January 20, 1761. The exact date of construction of the house is not known, but various sources date it anywhere from 1750 to 1758. After Peter's and his eldest son Jacob's deaths, which occurred within a year of each other, the land was inherited by Jacob's minor son Martin, who then transferred his interest to his uncle John. In 1794 the property went to Peter Hoyle's other grandson, Andrew, who became a farmer and entrepreneur. \\"Rich Andrew\\", as he was known, may have acquired the property with the house already standing and then improved the dwelling, or he may have built the house and later upgraded it with new finishes in the early years of the 19th century.{{Correction: North Carolina pioneer Peter Hoyle never owned the land upon which Hoyle Historic Homestead sits. The land was acquired by John Hoyle, son of Peter Hoyle, after Peter Hoyle's death via a 1765 North Carolina land grant for land in what then was Mecklenburg County. See digital image, indexed as \\"John \\"Hail\\" at David M.

The research was executed in 2006 by Kathy Gunter Sullivan, Certified Genealogist®, in behalf of Hoyle Historic Homestead and reported in \\"Andrew Hoyle Research Report 2,\\" p. 1. One goal of the Andrew Hoyle research was to document title history of the land on which the Hoyle house sits.)}  Location  The Hoyle House stands on a hill overlooking the South Fork of the Catawba River. The house faces south toward a now overgrown dirt road; the Dallas-Stanley Highway on the north side now provides access to the property.  Structure  The earliest section has a foundation of small stones, still partly visible. The house's German-American hallmarks include its heavy timber frame construction with vertical braces at the corners with tightly fitted horizontal log infillings. The apparently original and complete roof structure is now covered with early 20th century tin, and much of the unusual original beaded siding, applied circa 1810 with cut nails, survives covered by weatherboard. Weathering beneath the beaded siding reveals the exterior was originally unsheathed. Some of the early windows remain, set in molded surrounds with molded sills that appear to date to 1810. The windows originally were small (about two and a half feet square) and possibly filled only with shutters in the earliest period. The first floor of the main block is a four-room plan of two larger rooms on the east side, with corner fireplaces sharing a single chimney, and two smaller west rooms. Each pair of rooms is of equal width, but the front rooms are slightly deeper. A later, second north-south partition, no longer in place, once created a center-hall plan. Today all rooms connect with adjacent rooms. The original staircase, in the southeast corner of the larger front room, enclosed with one set of winders and at least one stop outside the enclosure, was removed in the late 1960s. The first floor interior is carefully finished. Much of the modern sheetrock and painting have been removed to reveal early board ceilings and walnut paneled partitions and paneling on the outer walls. While some or all of the interior sheathing appears to date after 1810, all of the trim and some of the ceiling probably date to the first remodeling. The three room plan of the second floor consists of a large east room that comprises about two thirds of the space along with two small west rooms. The north-south paneled partition is similar to the partition of the first floor. This basic three room plan probably is original, although the partition has been moved at least twice. Notches on the baseboard and patching of the wall plasters and chair rail indicate the wall was moved east, into the larger space, by about three feet. All outer walls were exposed logs until they were plastered, probably early in the 19th century. A door in the northeast corner of the large east room leads to an enclosed attic staircase; in the stairwell the structural system is clearly evident because the corner post, down braces and log filling have never been sheathed. The two remaining outbuildings date from the early- to mid-19th century. Near the northeast corner of the main house, the well house is a one-story, rectangular common bond brick building with ventilation holes on the ends. A gabled tin roof extends beyond the west end and acts as a porch sheltering the well. The well house stands at the southeast corner, and east of the well house stands a weatherboarded smokehouse with a gabled roof sheathed in sheet metal.  Importance  The Hoyle House is an important and, in some respects, apparently unique landmark of traditional German-American architecture in North Carolina. The unusually large, for its time, and substantial dwelling exemplifies a construction method-- heavy timber frame with log infill-- seen elsewhere in the mid-Atlantic Germanic settlement areas but not previously identified in North Carolina. The date of construction, and thus the identity of the first owner of the house, cannot be conclusively determined from existing documentation, nor can the exact chronology of its development. It is not clear if the house was built by 1761. With further investigation, if the Hoyle House can be firmly dated through archaeology, dendrochronology, or additional documentation, its place in the development of German-American architecture in the Piedmont can be more clearly understood.

Biography Robert Hébras, Jean- Marcel Darthout, Mathieu Borie, Clément Broussaudier, Yvon Roby and Pierre- Henri Poutaraud were the only six of 186 male civilians who survived the execution with machine guns. These six stayed in the barn, partly covered beneath the dead bodies of their friends, and pretended to be dead. The SS soldiers went on the pile of corpses and shot everyone who was still moving. They set the barn on fire 15 minutes after the execution to cover up the massacre. Poutaraud fled out of the fire too soon and was murdered by a guard positioned near the cemetery. Fearing for their lives, the five remaining men hid under burning corpses long enough that they themselves caught fire. Hébras said \\"My left arm and my hair had already burned. It was a terrible pain; therefore I had to get out of the barn.” Three of five men who escaped out of the burning village were seriously injured by the hail of bullets, including Hébras. One bullet remained stuck in his leg, another touched his wrist. Hébras's mother Marie, nine-year-old sister Denise, and 22-year-old sister Georgette died in the massacre. His father only survived by chance as he happened to be at a farm outside Oradour, as did his sister Leni, who had married and moved away. After the massacre, Hébras participated actively in the resistance against Nazism; in the last year of the war he also fought for the French Resistance. In 1983, he took part in the lawsuit against Heinz Barth, one of the assassins of Oradour, as a witness in the former East Germany. In 2003 a documentary movie was published, titled Encounter with Robert Hébras - On the trail of extinguished life (“Begegnung mit Robert Hébras - Auf den Spuren ausgelöschten Lebens\\") by German filmmaker Bodo Kaiser.

Emil Molt states: 'He was the benefactor of Bruckner and Hugo Wolf, indeed the right arm of Bruckner, taking care that affairs went smoothly. He was a world traveller, had mastered Jui-jitsu and taught himself all sorts of difficult tricks. The story went around that he had trained himself to jump off a fast moving train without getting hurt. He too, was a highly gifted mathematician and a learned man in many respects.' Also the husband of fellow theosophist and writer Bertha Diener, Eckstein's penchant for occultism first became evident as a member of a vegetarian group which discussed the doctrines of Pythagoras and the Neo-Platonists in Vienna at the end of the 1870s. His esoteric interests later extended to German and Spanish mysticism, the legends surrounding the Templars and the freemasons, Wagnerian mythology and oriental religions. In 1889, in the week after the tragedy at Mayerling, in which Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, and his mistress were found dead in mysterious circumstances, he and his friend, the composer Anton Bruckner (for whom he also served as private secretary) traveled to the monastery of Stift Heiligenkreuz to ask the abbot there for details of what happened.

Alfred Tarski had previously shown that the theory of the real numbers (without the exponential function) is decidable. The problem The ordered real field R is a structure over the language of ordered rings Lor = (+,·,−,<,0,1), with the usual interpretation given to each symbol. It was proved by Tarski that the theory of the real field, Th(R), is decidable. That is, given any Lor-sentence φ there is an effective procedure for determining whether :\\\\R\\\\models\\\\varphi. He then asked whether this was still the case if one added a unary function exp to the language that was interpreted as the exponential function on R, to get the structure Rexp. Conditional and equivalent results The problem can be reduced to finding an effective procedure for determining whether any given exponential polynomial in n variables and with coefficients in Z has a solution in Rn. showed that Schanuel's conjecture implies such a procedure exists, and hence gave a conditional solution to Tarski's problem. Schanuel's conjecture deals with all complex numbers so would be expected to be a stronger result than the decidability of Rexp, and indeed, Macintyre and Wilkie proved that only a real version of Schanuel's conjecture is required to imply the decidability of this theory. Even the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is not a necessary condition for the decidability of the theory. In their paper, Macintyre and Wilkie showed that an equivalent result to the decidability of Th(Rexp) is what they dubbed the Weak Schanuel's Conjecture. This conjecture states that there is an effective procedure that, given n ≥ 1 and exponential polynomials in n variables with integer coefficients f1,..., fn, g, produces an integer η ≥ 1 that depends on n, f1,..., fn, g, and such that if α ∈ Rn is a non- singular solution of the system :f_1(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n,e^{x_1},\\\\ldots,e^{x_n})=\\\\ldots=f_n(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n,e^{x_1},\\\\ldots,e^{x_n})=0 then either g(α) = 0 or |g(α)> η−1.  Workaround  Recently there are attempts at handling the theory of the real numbers with functions such as exp, sin by relaxing decidability to the weaker notion of quasi-decidability. A theory is quasi-decidable if there is a procedure that decides satisfiability but that may run forever for inputs that are not robust in a certain, well-defined sense. Such a procedure exists for systems of n equations in n variables ().

The incident occurred in 1930 and 1931 in Lemon Grove, California, where the local school board attempted to build a separate school for children of Mexican origin. On March 30, 1931, the Superior Court of San Diego County ruled that the local school board's attempt to segregate 75 Mexican and Mexican American elementary school children was a violation of California state laws because ethnic Mexicans were considered White under the state's Education Code. Although often overlooked in the history of school desegregation, the Lemon Grove Case is increasingly heralded as the first victory over segregative educational practices and as a testimony to the Mexican immigrant parents who effectively utilized the U.S. legal system to protect their children's rights.  Background  The segregation of Mexican and Mexican American children was commonplace throughout the Southwest in the early-to-mid 1900s. While the California Education Code did not explicitly allow for the segregation of children of Mexican descent, approximately 80% of California school districts with substantial Mexican and Mexican American populations were segregated. The other 20% of school districts maintained partial forms of segregation, such as segregated classrooms within mixed schools. School boards in cities such as Pasadena, Santa Ana, Riverside, and Los Angeles offered various rationales for such segregation. Many districts relied on linguistic arguments, claiming that segregation was necessary given English \\"language handicaps\\". Others cited the need to train Mexican and Mexican American youth for \\"appropriate\\" jobs. Several districts argued that \\"Americanization\\" schools were necessary to properly assimilate Mexican and Mexican American youth. Authorities often promised that Mexican and Mexican American youth could be integrated upon their mastery of the English language and their complete Americanization; yet these pledges almost always went unfulfilled. Records indicate that such \\"Mexican schools\\" had substandard facilities, shorter school years, and poorer quality of instruction. Furthermore, in the city of Lemon Grove itself there was a growing resentment against its Mexican population due to the sudden rise in growth rates for this particular demographic as well as the overall fear of the loss of white collar jobs from US citizens and giving them to Mexican Americans.  Case background  In this context, the integrated grammar school of Lemon Grove was an anomaly. The Mexican and Mexican American students, children to the fifty-odd Mexican immigrant families from Baja California, accounted for about half of the school's 169 students. Furthermore, the student population found within the Lemon Grove School District was approximately 75 Mexican and Mexican American students and 95 white students. On July 23, 1930, the all-Anglo Lemon Grove school board decided to build a separate school for children of Mexican heritage without giving notice to their parents. The plan was discussed by the school board and subsequently endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce and local PTA. By August, the board felt that the \\"situation had reached emergency conditions\\" due to overcrowding and \\"sanitary and moral\\" issues stemming from the Mexican and Mexican American youth. In this plan to separate these students from their peers, the school board expected that \\"the Mexican community would docilely separate itself and send its children to the new school.\\" This \\"new school\\" where the students were to be separated was an old two room building that came to be known within the local Mexican American community as la caballeriza, meaning \\"the barn,\\" on Olive Street. After an emergency meeting between the board was conducted on August 13, the Mexican and Mexican American students of the school were expelled and later on their school supplies/belongings and desks were later transferred to the building. On January 5, 1931, Lemon Grove Grammar School principal Jerome Green, acting under instructions from school trustees, turned away Mexican children at the schoolhouse door,directing them to the new school. In response, parents who were outraged at the response refused to send their children to the new school. Since they were not allowed back at the main schoolhouse, this resulted in a boycott. Through this boycott, 75 students remained at home and the local press took note of this protest, writing this in the headlines as \\"the Mexican Student Strike.\\" Despite their lack of representation in official channels of power such as the PTA or the Chamber of Commerce, the parents quickly organized El Comité de Vecinos de Lemon Grove (the Lemon Grove Neighbors Committee). Parents would meet in the household of one of the families whose children were refused to be allowed in the school and would discuss plan on what was to be done against the separation of the Mexican students from the grammar school. The parents sought the assistance of the Mexican consul in San Diego, Enrique Ferreira, who put them in touch with two attorneys.These two San Diego attorneys were Fred Noon and A. C. Brinkley. Noon worked in the city since 1928 and knew Spanish well enough in order to communicate with parents on how to file for the court case. The Comité also sought the support of the broader Mexican and Mexican American community on both sides of the border; the Mexican government also gave the parents and their organization full support as they protested against his decision made by the school board and the PTA. The community responded with both moral and financial support that allowed the Comité to cover the costs of the upcoming lawsuit. Other responses from the community included the support of Mexican and Spanish speaking news media from Mexico and the US; one particular news outlet known as La Opinion was able to closely follow and report on the legal actions and wrote editorials supporting the students involved in the strike. Through these media outlets, El Comité was able to gain significant support from \\"the community, the press and the Mexican Consul.\\"  Lawsuit and trial  The Comité, with the assistance of the two attorneys, filed a suit against the Lemon Grove School Board in the Superior Court of California in San Diego on February 13, 1931. Submitted in the name of Mexican American student Roberto Alvarez, the petition accused the school board of \\"an attempt at racial segregation… by separating and segregating all the children of Mexican parentage\\". The suit also pointed out that 95% of the children who the school board sought to segregate were U.S. citizens and thus \\"entitled to all the rights and privileges common to all citizens of the United States. Alvarez and ten other students gave their recounts that proved that their separation of the school was actually built on inaccurate information concerning the intelligence and learning capabilities of Mexican and Mexican American students and a prejudiced assumption that these students didn't have an understanding of the English language. Alvarez himself was chosen to be named as the plaintiff for this court case due to the fact that his academic records proved to be a counter to what the school board was presenting to the court case. The attorneys during the trial also questioned the teachers who were to teach in the segregated, whether or not they were fully capable in being able to teach all these students. In once such situation, the attorneys questioned a newly experienced teacher who was expected to teach four grades in one classroom. The attorney then questioned how was teaching students from four different grade levels in one class in the segregated building would create a different learning experience than having one teacher teach one grade in the other school with all the students integrated together. As a result the claim from these teachers assigned to teach at the segregated school was similar to the ones the school board presented, claiming that it would provide more individualized attention to the students. The Lemon Grove school board denied all of the suit's allegations and, asking school boards throughout the Southwest, insisted that the separate facility was designed for the benefit of the Mexican and Mexican American youth. The Board maintained that the school was not designed to segregate Mexican children; rather, it argued: 1) that the new facility could house up to 85 pupils and that it boasted a fully equipped playground, 2) that the facility was located in the predominantly Mexican area of town so that children could travel safely to school without risking the walk across the main road, 3) that the majority of the children lacked sufficient knowledge of English and could benefit from special attention, and 4) that it was an Americanization school in which \\"backward and deficient\\" children could receive better, and more appropriate, instruction. The evidence revealed in trial challenged the \\"backward and deficient\\" characterization of the Mexican and Mexican American children and, most pointedly, the board's location and language arguments. The landmark lawsuit resulting from the \\"Lemon Grove Incident\\" became the first successful school desegregation court decision in the history of the United States. On March 30, 1931, the presiding Judge Chambers issued his ruling in favor of Roberto Alvarez. The judge repudiated each of the school board's claims. Although allowing that the school board could \\"separate a few children to offer special instruction,\\" he wrote, \\"to separate all the Mexicans in one group can only be done by infringing the laws of the State of California.\\" In the decision, the judge ruled that children of Mexican origin could not be segregated under the laws of the state of California, because they were \\"of the Caucasian race\\", and laws allowing the segregation of \\"Oriental\\", \\"Negro\\", and \\"Indian\\" children therefore did not apply.The judge also ruled in favor of Alvarez during this court case since he believed that \\"the pedagogical and curricular segregation\\" that the board wanted to implement actually inhibited on how these students needed to learn and in fact needed to be exposed to other American children which in his words was \\"so necessary to learn the English language.\\"  Decision and results  The decision was not appealed, in large part due to the perceived risk of further financial burdens to the district and negative public image. For decades, the only official mention of the court case in local records came in the notes of a post-trial school board meeting, \\"All members of the board present. On account of having lost the court decision there was some discussion about the return of Mexican (children) pupils but only a spirit of good will prevailed, and it was decided that everything was to continue exactly as it did prior to January 5th.\\" Not even the history of the Lemon Grove School from 1880 to 1966, prepared by a former superintendent, referenced the case. The ruling did result in the immediate re-entrance of the Mexican and Mexican American students to the grammar school; yet, the ruling did not have concrete implications for desegregation in other segregated California schools. It was not until over a decade later, with Mendez v. Westminster, that schools desegregated statewide.  Significance  Despite its initial obscurity and limited broader impact, the Lemon Grove Case has increasingly gained recognition for its place in the trajectory of school desegregation as the first successful desegregation case. Moreover, scholars agree that the case constitutes a testament to the Mexican immigrant families who, despite a hostile political climate, refused to accept separate and inferior educations for their children and who leveraged the U.S. legal system to challenge such a violation of their children's rights. As noted by historian Robert Alvarez Jr., \\"This was the first situation when a group of immigrants had gotten together, challenged a school board and won.\\" Some scholars also believe that the case may have contributed to the defeat of a bill in the California state legislature (commonly known as the \\"Bliss Bill\\") that would have made it legal to segregate children of Mexican descent under the state's education code. In looking at this bill in further detail, the plan of this legislation was to redefine Mexicans as \\"Indians\\" rather than \\"white\\", thus making it permissible to follow segregation laws against Mexicans in California. Another aspect that this court case left behind was the issue regarding classifying Mexican Americans as being \\"white.\\" Particularly concerning Judge Chamber's ruling on the students' being classified \\"of the Caucasian race.\\" The verdict that came as a result from this case \\"did not challenge racial segregation per se\\" which meant that this exception would not span out to all students of color; in a sense these students weren't categorized under a group that enabled them to be permitted under the law to be segregated by districts and schools. The judge's ruling for the students in favor of the students in this court case was viewed as that the learning capability of these students \\"would help them overcome their colored status\\" through their education. Since this court case did not expand or create an effect that led to the eventual desegregation of other schools in the nation, at the local level, the case has received recognition. In 1986, PBS with the collaboration of an ethnic studies professor in UCSD, Robert Alvarez, made a documentary film highlighting historical footage and interviews in order to portray the actions done by parents and students as part of the protest against the school board. On March 9, 2007, the Lemon Grove School District recognized Roberto Alvarez, the schoolboy who was the lead plaintiff in the case. The auditorium at the Lemon Grove Middle School, which is on the site of the former grammar school, was dedicated in his honor.Lemon Grove School District Dedicates Auditorium to Civil Rights Hero Robert Alvarez, Lemon Grove School District Website Announcement, archived September 29, 2007 In the year 2011 to commemorate the 80 years since this trial occurred, a professor from Palomar college arranged for the screening of a documentary focusing on the lives of Mexican Americans living during the time period this court case was held and titled this as \\"The Lemon Grove Oral History Project.\\" On May 5th 2016, in order to commemorate the 85 years since the court case was ruled a bill was created in acknowledging March, 30th as being a historic date to remember concerning the City of Lemon Grove.

Exhibition history The painting was first shown at the World Exhibition in Vienna in 1873 where it won a gold medal. It was later displayed at an international exhibition of art at the Academy of Art in Berlin in 1896 while Gude was a professor at the Academy, and yet later still it was shown in Dresden in 1904, the year after Gude's death. Scene and style The painting shows a realistic rendering of a storm hitting a Norwegian harbor, with a brig stranded in the distant breakers. The painting is divided into a foreground, where women and children watch the rescue effort; a middle ground, where various moored ships bob in the strong waves; and a background, where wavelike rocks enclose the refuge point and bring the eye down to the stranded brig. The colors used are predominantly the blue-grey of the sea and the beige of the reflections on the sea which serve to unify the piece. Various elements of the scene including the waterfront buildings, the groups of figures, and the departing rowboat, would be reused by Gude in later works. Ownership In 1875, the painting was purchased by the Bremen Art Society, although Gude incorrectly identifies them as the Stadtgalerie Bremen in his notes about the sale. In 1907 the painting was transferred to the Kunsthalle Bremen. In 1920 the painting was auctioned off due in part to changing tastes in art and the painting's large size () which made it difficult to store. In 1932 the painting was auctioned off again in Oslo where it was purchased by its current owner.

At fourteen, he was apprenticed to Professor Louis Loeffler, a church decorator in Milwaukee. Then his practical, Bavarian-immigrant parents prevailed in their quest to have Conrad attend business school for two years. The time he spent learning the basics of running a business turned out to provide invaluable knowledge for the founder of an international art studio. Conrad also studied under the respected mural artist, Jan Sukaczynski, and with master painters in Rome. They included Joseph Wilpert, a fresco painter who was also an expert in the ancient artwork of the catacombs. Conrad was a talented artist and a hard worker. In order to keep a promise to his employer while decorating the Milwaukee courthouse, he once walked twelve miles from his father’s home in a heavy snowstorm. By the age of twenty, Conrad was already handling large projects for bishops, bankers and elite residential clients. He drew employees from the many skilled, European artists living in the U.S. He also visited Europe and brought those with great talent to America. Soon CSS had a staff approaching two dozen.

Territorially, the quaestura exercitus contained the Roman provinces of Moesia Inferior and Scythia Minor, located in the lower Danube region, as well as the provinces of Cyprus, Caria, and the Aegean Islands (i.e. the Cyclades). All of these provinces were detached from the Praetorian prefecture of the East and placed under the authority of a new army official known as the quaestor exercitus (\\"Quaestor of the army\\"). The authority of the quaestor was the equivalent to that of a magister militum. Since the strategically vital Danubian provinces were economically impoverished, the purpose of the quaestura exercitus was to help support the troops that were stationed there. By connecting the exposed provinces of the Lower Danube with wealthier provinces in the interior of the empire, Justinian was able to transport supplies via the Black Sea. This territorial restructuring relieved both the destitute populations and devastated countryside of the Danubian provinces from sustaining any stationed troops. There is a lack of subsequent evidence on the history of the quaestura exercitus. However, since the position of quaestor was still extant during the mid-570s, this indicates that the overall territorial unit achieved a modicum of success. Ultimately, the Danubian provinces associated with the quaestura exercitus did not survive the Slav and Avar invasions of the Balkans in the 7th century. However, isolated fortresses on the Danube delta and along the coast of the Black Sea were maintained via supplies by sea. Charles Diehl first raised the suggestion that the great naval corps of the Karabisianoi, which appears in the 680s, was first formed by the remainders of the quaestura. This argument has been adopted by some scholars since but challenged by others, notably Helene Ahrweiler in her study of the Byzantine navy. This question is bound up with the discussion on the respective formations' nature as military-naval or civil-administrative entities.cf. and , for a discussion of the controversy and literature. Lead seals from Moesia Inferior and Scythia Minor provide evidence supporting the existence of the quaestura exercitus. Specifically, thirteen imperial seals (nine of which are from Justinian) demonstrate that communications between officials from Scythia Minor and Constantinople occurred on a somewhat regular basis.

It is denoted by \\\\operatorname{Supp}(M). The support is, by definition, a subset of the spectrum of A.  Properties  * M = 0 if and only if its support is empty. * Let 0 \\\\to M' \\\\to M \\\\to M \\\\to 0 be an exact sequence of A-modules.

In particular, it is closed in the Zariski topology on Spec(A). *If M, N are finitely generated A-modules, then *:\\\\operatorname{Supp}(M \\\\otimes_A N) = \\\\operatorname{Supp}(M) \\\\cap \\\\operatorname{Supp}(N). *If M is a finitely generated A-module and I is an ideal of A, then \\\\operatorname{Supp}(M/IM) is the set of all prime ideals containing I + \\\\operatorname{Ann}(M). This is V(I)\\\\cap \\\\operatorname{Supp}(M).  Support of a quasicoherent sheaf  If F is a quasicoherent sheaf on a scheme X, the support of F is the set of all points x∈X such that the stalk Fx is nonzero. This definition is similar to the definition of the support of a function on a space X, and this is the motivation for using the word \\"support\\". Most properties of the support generalize from modules to quasicoherent sheaves word by word. For example, the support of a coherent sheaf (or more generally, a finite type sheaf) is a closed subspace of X. If M is a module over a ring A, then the support of M as a module coincides with the support of the associated quasicoherent sheaf \\\\tilde{M} on the affine scheme Spec(A). Moreover, if \\\\\\\\{ U_\\\\alpha = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A_\\\\alpha) \\\\\\\\} is an affine cover of a scheme X, then the support of a quasicoherent sheaf F is equal to the union of supports of the associated modules Mα over each Aα.  Examples  As noted above, a prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} is in the support if and only if it contains the annihilator of M. For example, the annihilator of : \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]}{(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4)} \\\\in \\\\text{Mod}(\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]) is the ideal (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4). This implies that : \\\\text{Supp}(M) \\\\cong \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]/(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4)) the vanishing locus of the polynomial. Looking at the short exact sequence : 0 \\\\to I \\\\to R \\\\to R/I \\\\to 0 we might think that the support of (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4) is isomorphic to : \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]_{(x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4)}) which is the complement of the vanishing locus of the polynomial. However, since \\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w] is an integral domain, the ideal (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4) is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w] as a module, so its support is the entire space. The support of a finite module over a noetherian ring is always closed under specialization. Now, if we take two polynomials f_1,f_2 \\\\in R in an integral domain which form a complete intersection ideal (f_1,f_2), the tensor property shows us that : \\\\text{Supp}\\\\left( \\\\frac{R}{(f_1)}\\\\otimes_R \\\\frac{R}{(f_2)} \\\\right) = \\\\text{Supp}\\\\left( \\\\frac{R}{(f_1)}\\\\right) \\\\cap \\\\text{Supp}\\\\left( \\\\frac{R}{(f_2)}\\\\right) \\\\cong \\\\text{Spec}(R/(f_1,f_2)) See also *Annihilator (ring theory) *Associated prime *Support (mathematics)  References   Atiyah, M.

History  In the first year, the band consisted of Tor Egil \\"Gillo\\" Ingebrigtsen (bass), Viggo Mastad (guitar), Bård Noodt (vocals), and Jens-Petter Wiig (drums), but by the time the second album Half Past Heaven was released, Noodt was no longer with the group, and Mastad had taken over the singing in what now was a trio. Later guitarist Morten Skjørholm (from 1994 till now) and keyboard player and producer Trude Midtgaard (from 1994 till 2005) would also join. Israelvis became one of Norway’s most important alternative bands in the early nineties. Their debut was released in 1989, titled “Heart to Heart Politics”. One year later the band released “Half Past Heaven” (1990), the EP “We Only Live Twice” (1992), and could reach a breakthrough with the album “Albino Blue” in 1993. The following albums “Church of Israelvis” (1994) and “Eurosis” (1996) became fan favorites and in 2005 the band released their so far last album, \\"The Israelvis Effect\\". Although controversy surrounding their name followed the band through their career it wasn't until the release of the mini album 'Church Of Israelvis' in 1995 it had any greater effect. The cover, showing a young Elvis Presley with a bloody Star of David on his forehead, was banned in Germany causing the band to make a new cover for the German market. A picture of what looks like Jesus Christ with a bloody dollar sign painted on his forehead was instead chosen as the German version of the front cover. The album also had guest appearances from Steve Ignorant of Crass and Katja Osvold of Life... But How To Live It? The Israelvis sound can be described as an addition of sharp guitar hardrock/metal style, with ironically and politically charged lyrics. Their style was influenced by diverse genres, like punk, metal, jazz, electronica, mambo and other sonic brique-a-braques. The band's music has been described as cutting edge, unpredictable, and uncompromising. During the 90s, the band had significant success in the alternative music scene in Norway and Germany. During the summer of 2010 the band reunited for a one-off concert at the Pstereo festival in Trondheim, Norway, and also used the opportunity to record the single Random City, with Katja Benneche Osvold on lead vocals.

He coached at the high school and collegiate level in Texas and Oklahoma. Playing career Harrell grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. When he was a teenager, his father became too ill to work and left his wife and son and moved in with his own mother in Arlington. In spite of his desperate situation, Harrell stayed focused on his promising football career, and when his coach at Polytechnic High School, Wes Bradshaw, heard about the boy's predicament, he invited Harrell to stay with him. Bradshaw encouraged Harrell to try out for a football scholarship at Texas Christian University in 1934, and Harrell successfully drew the attention of Dutch Meyer. On the first day of practice at TCU, Harrell – a high school quarterback – watched Sammy Baugh work out, and immediately chose to compete for the halfback position instead. He was a three-time letterman in 1935, 1937 and 1938. Coaching career Just after graduation, Harrell began his coaching career at the Central Texas town of DeLeon. However, World War II interrupted his career in 1941. Serving in the rank of a sergeant, Harrell was stationed on Camp Wolters near Mineral Wells, Texas, where he was in charge of sixty men. After the war, Harrell restarted his coaching career, with stops at Odessa, Denison, Greenville, Lamesa, and Corpus Christi Miller. In 1953, he became head coach at San Angelo Central, before leaving in 1959. In 1961, Harrell took over at Irving. In 1962, Irving went undefeated through the season, only to lose 27-7 to Borger in the bi-district game. Harrell ended his career in 1964. He died in 2002.

Its main part is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, with its back entrance being listed separately, also at Grade II. History The building was constructed between 1887 and 1891 as a replacement for the Lancaster Mechanic's Institute, which stood on a different site, to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. It was paid for by Thomas Storey, a local businessman who had been mayor in the year of the Jubilee, and was renamed the Storey Institute in his honour in 1891. Its purpose was \\"the promotion of art, science, literature, and technical instruction\\". The building was designed by the architects Paley, Austin and Paley whose office stood nearby. It contained a reading room, a library, a lecture room, a laboratory, a music room, a picture gallery, a school of art, and accommodation for a caretaker. The building cost about £12,000 (equivalent to £ in ). In 1906–08 it was extended to commemorate the accession of Edward VII. This was designed by the successors in the architectural practice, Austin and Paley, to provide more rooms for teaching. Thomas Storey's son, Herbert, paid £10,000 towards the cost of the extension, which almost doubled the size of the building. The permanent art collection contained paintings by local artists including Samuel John \\"Lamorna\\" Birch and William Hoggatt. Its first art exhibition, held in 1889, included paintings by Gainsborough, Constable, and Canaletto. Over the years, the building has been used as the City Art Gallery, a public library, a girls’ grammar school, and from the 1950s to 1982 as the Lancaster College of Art. In the 1960s there were touring exhibitions of works by Picasso, Matisse, and Francis Bacon. The permanent art collection was moved in 1968 to Lancaster City Museum. By the 1980s the gallery was rarely used, and in 1991 a group of local artists re- established it as the Storey Gallery. In 1998 the walled gardens behind the institute were laid out as an art work,The Tasting Garden, by Mark Dion. In the early 21st century the institute was converted into a multi-use building by Lancaster City Council, and was renamed The Storey. It provided accommodation for small businesses, a café, galleries and exhibitions areas, workshops, and an information centre. The architects were Mason Gillibrand Architects of Caton. Architecture Back entrance =Main building= The building is constructed in sandstone ashlar with slate roofs, and is in Jacobean Revival style. It has façades on two fronts, with a turret on the corner. The turret is octagonal, with a lead dome surmounted by a spirelet. The building is in two storeys plus attics, above which are gables, some shaped and some segmental. Inside the building, on the first floor, is a curved window containing stained glass designed by Jowett of Shrigley and Hunt depicting representations of the arts. Also on this floor is a top-lit exhibition gallery. =Back entrance= This consists of a portico in Roman Doric style with two columns supporting a triglyph frieze and a cornice. At its summit is a pediment decorated with dentils. It contains its original wrought iron gates and overthrow. The structure was moved from an 18th-century house that was demolished in 1921, and rebuilt on the present site. The entrance leads to walled gardens behind the institute.

It was launched into Earth orbit on 30 August 1974 at 14:07:39 UTC in a Scout rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, United States. The mission ran for 20 months until June 1976, and was jointly funded by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (NIVR) and NASA. ANS was the first Dutch satellite, and the Main Belt asteroid 9996 ANS was named after it. ANS reentered Earth's atmosphere on June 14, 1977. The telescope had an initial orbit of with a periapsis of , an apoapsis of , with inclination 98.0° and eccentricity 0.064048, giving it a period of 99.2 minutes. The orbit was sun-synchronous, and the attitude of the spacecraft could be controlled through reaction wheels. The momentum stored in the reaction wheels throughout the orbit was regularly dumped via magnetic coils that interacted with the Earth's magnetic field. The satellite also had two masses that were released shortly after orbit injection, to remove most of the satellite's angular momentum induced by the launcher. The attitude could be measured by a variety of techniques, including solar sensors, horizon sensors, star sensors and a magnetometer. ANS could measure X-ray photons in the energy range 2 to 30 keV, with a 60 cm2 detector, and was used to find the positions of galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources. It also measured their spectra, and looked at their variations over time. It discovered X-ray bursts, and also detected X-rays from Capella. ANS also observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, with a 22 cm (260 cm2) Cassegrain telescope. The wavelengths of the observed photons were between 150 and 330 nm, with the detector split into five channels with central wavelengths of 155, 180, 220, 250 and 330 nm.

He was also known by the pseudonymn João do Norte pp. 366 of Grunspan-Jasmin, Elise \\"Lampião, senhor do sertão : vidas e mortes de um cangaceiro\\" EdUSP, São Paulo 2006  Biography  He was half German by birth, his mother coming from Württemberg. Barroso made his name as a journalist and was for a time involved with the socialist Clube Maximo Gorki. However his politics became more conservative after he secured a law degree in Rio de Janeiro in 1910. He soon became an important figure in Ceará state, serving variously as Secretary of the Interior and Justice, and being elected a Representative in the National Congress. He even formed part of the Brazilian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He would later rise to hold such positions as president of the Academia Brasileira de Letras (Brazilian Academy) and secretary-general of the International Committee of Legal Advisers. In 1933, Barroso joined the Brazilian Integralist Action, which had fascist characteristics. He soon became the head of the extreme anti-Jewish faction within the Brazilian Integralist Action. Noted for his hard-line antisemitism, he took charge of the group's militia from 1934 to 1936 before being appointed to the party's Supreme Council. An extensive writer, his polemical works at this time included many anti-semitic books and newspaper articles in Fon-Fon and Século XX magazines. Due to political differences Barroso came to be regarded as dangerous by the more constitutionally minded Integralista party's leader, Plínio Salgado, who suspended him from collaborating for six months with the party's newspaper, A Ofensiva. However Barroso continued to pursue his antisemitic ideals, translating The Protocols of the Elders of Zion into Portuguese and even suggesting setting up concentration camps. Following the formation of the Estado Novo dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas (1938–1945), Barroso was arrested in 1938 after the Brazilian Integralist Action attempted a violent coup d´etat. However Barroso was never tried due to a lack of evidence of his involvement in the coup d´etat. He subsequently left political activism and became largely accepting of Getúlio Vargas posterior constitutional government (1951–1954), serving as a special ambassador to Uruguay (1952) and Peru (1954). He was mentioned as a relevant intellectual in a publication that lists extreme-right activists from the whole world. A museum in Fortaleza, his home town, the Museu Gustavo Barroso, bears his name.Museums details  Works  A keen Folklorist, Barroso built up a collection of exhibits relating to Brazil's past at the Museu Histórico Nacional in Rio de Janeiro and produced around 50 non-political books including historical and regional novels, folklore studies and biographies of Brazilian national military heroes such as General Osório and Admiral Tamandaré.MARTIN, Percy Alvin. 'Reviews of Osório, o Centauro dos Pampas and Tamandaré, o Nelson Brasileiro by Gustavo Barroso'. The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 15, No. 1. (Feb., 1935), pp. 67-69 As a novelist, he produced the work Terra de Sol (1912), which demonstrated his admiration for the people of northeastern Brazil's rural areas. Barroso was often linked in with the neorealist school of Brazilian literature, although he differed from the neorealism typified by the likes of Erico Verissimo, Amando Fontes and Telmo Vergara by his emphasis on rural rather than urban settings.COUTINHO, A. An Introduction to Literature in Brazil, Columbia University Press, 1969, p. 247 Barroso belonged to the regionalist documentary strand of Brazilian neorealism, although, along with Mário Sete, he rejected the modernism inherent in the works of contemporaries in the genre such as Jorge Luis de Rêgo and Jorge Amado.COUTINHO, op cit, p. 248 He also published a few works on Lampião, besides the aforementioned \\"Terra do Sol\\", also \\"Herois e Bandidos\\" (1917) and \\"Alma de Lama e de Aço\\"(1928). An a political writer, his polemical works when joined to the Brazilian Integralist Action included O Liceu do Ceará, Brasil: Colônia de Banqueiros and História Secreta do Brasil. He also translated The Protocols of the Elders of Zion into Portuguese.

Alexander of Abingdon, also known as Alexander Imaginator or Alexander le Imagineur (i.e. \\"the image-maker\\"), was one of the leading sculptors of England around 1300.  Life  Alexander of Abingdon is assumed to have been from Abingdon, Berkshire, which was something of a centre of stonecutting and masonry. By 1291 he was active in London, where he probably lived for most of his life. In the accounts of the executors of the estate of Queen Eleanor of Castile, Alexander is described as a maker of images (\\"le ymagour\\"). It seems that this term indicated a maker of statues of human figures carved in the round, rather than a mason working on the general architectural ornament. From 1291 to 1294, he was employed on carving the marble tomb-chest for the bronze effigy of Queen Eleanor of Castile in Lincoln Cathedral. Alexander of Abingdon also supplied wax models for three small images cast by William of Suffolk for Eleanor's heart in the Blackfriars' church in London. All of these works are now lost. He is last documented in 1316–17, when he was associated with the royal master mason, Michael of Canterbury. It is likely that Alexander and Michael of Canterbury also worked together at Ely Cathedral on the tomb of Bishop William of Louth (died 1298), Alexander again being responsible for the effigy.  Work  Alexander of Abingdon's three authenticated sculpturesCh. T. Little, \\"An English Sculpture attributed to Alexander of Abingdon\\". In: La sculpture en occident: études offertes à Jean-René Gaborit, sous la direction de Geneviève Bresc-Bautier; Françoise Baron; Pierre-Yves Le Pogam, Dijon: Faton, 2007. are now on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. These figures represent Queen Eleanor of Castile and they were carved for the Waltham Cross, one of the twelve monumental \\"Eleanor crosses\\" commissioned by her husband, King Edward I, after the Queen's death in Harby, Nottinghamshire in 1290. These memorials marked the places where Eleanor's body rested for the night on the funerary route to Westminster. On the basis of stylistic similarities, the sculpture of a standing Virgin and Child, acquired by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2003, is also attributed to Alexander of Abingdon. The sculptor's style is characterised by a subtle treatment of draperies, which are both heavy and intricate. There are stylistic affinites between Alexander of Abingdon's figures and the paintings and illuminations in the Westminster style. Abingdon's work has been associated particularly with that of the painter and illuminator, Master Walter of Durham, who was active in the Palace of Westminster and in the Westminster Abbey and who is also known to have executed work on Queen Eleanor's tomb around 1292. Master Walter might have also done some work for Abingdon Abbey. The affinity between Alexander of Abingdon's sculptures and contemporary illuminations assist in locating him within the circle of courtly art.The Age of Chivalry: Art in Plantagenet England.

Because she was privately built, she was not of a ship class. She was the only U.S. Navy ship of this name. The ship served on the East Coast, in Bermuda, and in the Azores during World War I. After the war, she operated from New York and Norfolk, Virginia until decommissioning in 1922. She was considered one of the most powerful tugs in the Navy during her career. Lykens was sold in 1934.  History  Lykens was built in 1899 by Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia for the Reading Company. On 17 September 1903, Lykens rescued the captain of tug Spartan which had sunk the previous night in a gale off Lewes, Delaware. A storm on 10 January 1911 caused coal barges Treverton, Corbin, and Pine Forest, under tow by Lykens, to break free of the tow near the Cape Cod Light. The 12 men crewing Treverton and Corbin were drowned when their barges broke up within an hour. The five men aboard Pine Forest were all drowned when their lifeboat was swamped in the rough surf. Lykens and local lifesavers watching from the shore were helpless to provide any assistance because of the severity of the storm. Despite the accident, Lykens remained a frequent visitor to ports in New England.See \\"Shipping News\\" in the Christian Science Monitor on 3 July 1912, 2 June 1914, 10 August 1914, 17 August 1914, and 7 October 1915, for example. On 4 February 1917, Lykens was inspected by the 4th Naval District of the U.S. Navy. After the U.S. had entered World War I, Lykens was purchased by the Navy on 18 September 1917. She was commissioned USS Lykens (SP-876) on 10 November 1917 at Philadelphia, Lt. (jg.) H. G. Robinson, USNRF, in command. Lykens around the time she was taken over by the U.S. Navy, c. 1917 Lykens performed towing duties along the east coast, to Bermuda, and the Azores throughout World War I. On 24 February 1918, Lykens, along with , and set sail from Newport, Rhode Island, rendezvousing with eleven submarine chasers en route. Though Mariner foundered and sank along the journey, all the other ships arrived at Bermuda on 1 March. On 15 April, Lykens set sail from Bermuda in the company of Wadena, seven submarine chasers, and United States Army tug Knickerbocker, arriving at Ponta Delgada in the Azores on 27 April. After the war she was assigned to district towing and auxiliary operations, out of the 3d (New York) and 5th (Norfolk) Naval Districts. Lykens continued these duties until she decommissioned at New York 23 March 1920. She recommissioned as AT‑56 17 June 1920, Lt. G. Freudendorf in command, and served as a fleet tug in the 3d Naval District out of New York. On 30 April 1921 Lykens and Coast Guard Cutter were dispatched to assist submarine that had grounded off Montauk Point in Block Island Sound. Lykens and Acushnet were delayed by heavy fog and did not reach the stranded sub before the tide lifted it from its perch. In late 1921 the engines from the Navy’s four Lake Torpedo Boat-built N-class submarines were removed to be installed in more modern L-class submarines. In early 1922, Lykens got the call to tow three of the engineless subs from New London, Connecticut, to Philadelphia for decommissioning and scrapping. She towed in late January, in February, and in April. Lykens was decommissioned on 9 December 1922 and kept in reserve until 3 February 1934, when she was sold to Northern Metal Co. of Philadelphia. Her ultimate fate is unknown.

It began with meetings between the Superintendents of schools in Smyth County, Washington County, and Bristol in December 1986 to propose the formation of a league to allow students to participate in academic competitions. This idea was presented to the principals of the schools in the Spring of 1987 and the name Southwest Academic Conference (SWAC) was chosen.Microsoft Word - SWAC 2007-08 The schools involved were Abingdon High School, John S. Battle High School, Chilhowie High School, Holston High School, Marion Senior High School, Northwood High School, Patrick Henry High School, Virginia High School. Competition The schools have teams for the content areas of English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies. The English team has an approved reading list each season focusing on selected plays, novels, short stories, nonfiction, and poetry as well as specific terminology. The Math team focuses on studies from Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, and Trigonometry. The science team focuses on the studies of physical science, earth science, biology, and chemistry. The social studies questions involve treaties, US Supreme Court cases, legislation, geography, and history. In addition to the content area specific teams, there is an All-Around team which focuses on information regarding art and architecture, performing arts (dance, theater, music), philosophy, religion, world literature (including mythology), math (including the history of math), science (physical science, earth science, biology, chemistry, psychology), and social studies (US history and world history, sociology, anthropology. Schools generally compete twice per week on Monday and Thursday with four schools hosting the competitions and four schools traveling to the school against which they are competing. For 2008, the order of competition is social studies, all around, English, math, science. The teams compete with four players each. The first round in all areas but math has 10 directed questions for each team where the emcee asks each team a question and allows them to answer, however if the team misses the other team gets an opportunity to answer the question. The math team's directed round has 10 directed questions and both teams are allowed to answer by writing the answer on a piece of paper which the emcee collects at the end of the time allowed to answer. All categories have a second round made up of ten toss-up questions where players from either team may ring in to answer. If a player rings in before the emcee says \\"Begin\\" and answers incorrectly, there is a 2-point penalty and the question is read in its entirety for the other school. Each correct answer in both rounds is worth five points.

AFH emphasizes that its focus is on the athlete's time and not their money.Athletes For Hope Athletes for Hope has grown from its original Founders to over 4,000 athletes across many sports leagues, including the WNBA, NBA, NFL, NHL, NASCAR, MLB, MLS, USATF, and the Olympic movement. These athletes take part in their Causeway program, which provides education workshops and subsequently one-on-one guidance for each athlete through their personal philanthropic journey. Athletes for Hope has worked with hundreds of professional and Olympic athletes in helping them connect with a variety of charities. As part of this connection program, Athletes for Hope hosts several campaigns throughout the year, such as the Athletes for Active Schools week where athletes participate in school visits throughout the country to promote healthy eating and activity through the Let’s Move Active Schools program. In honor of the anniversary of September 11, Athletes for Hope coordinated a visit for Cleveland Cavaliers star Kyrie Irving to visit underserved children at the Beech Brook home in Cleveland, OH.

Listed at , , Kramer batted and threw right-handed. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. Kramer pitched 16 seasons from 1936 to 1959, twelve in the major leagues and six in the minors. He entered the majors in 1939 with the St. Louis Browns, playing for them three years before joining the U.S. Navy Seabees during World War II. Following his service discharge, he rejoined the Browns in the 1943 midseason and later was demoted to the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. On September 11, he pitched a 5–0 no-hitter against the Louisville Colonels. He struggled with his control in his first four years (201 walks in 345.0 IP), but received a fifth chance in part to the World War II player shortage. He responded with a heroic effort that culminated in the Browns only World Series appearance. Kramer's 1949 Bowman Gum baseball card In 1944, Kramer led the Browns to their 8th straight Opening Day victory‚ beating Dizzy Trout and Detroit‚ 2–1, at Tiger Stadium. A week later, he extended the Browns season-opening winning streak to six games defeating the White Sox, 5–2, aiding his cause with a two-run home run. In his next start, he pitches the Browns to their American League record 9th straight win to start the season with a 3–1 victory over the Indians, which gave his team a solid 3 game lead in the AL standings. Kramer finished with a 17–13 record and a 2.49 ERA, including a brilliant one-hitter shutout over the White Sox in September that gave St. Louis a half game lead in front of the Yankees. The Browns finished with an 89–65 record and faced the Cardinals in the historic All-St.Louis World Series. Kramer added a complete game victory in Game Three, allowing just two unearned runs on seven hits and 10 strikeouts. This would be the last time the hapless Browns won a post-season game. From 1945 to 1947, Kramer averaged 11 wins per season and made the American League All-Star team three times. In the 1946 Game he tossed three no-hit, shutout innings to earn a save. In addition, he went one-for-one and scored a run. In November 1947, he was sent along Vern Stephens to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Pete Layden, Joe Ostrowski, Roy Partee, Eddie Pellagrini, Al Widmar, Jim Wilson and cash. In 1948, Kramer went 18–5 for Boston, including a 12-game winning streak from June 3 to August 10 and five victories over the Yankees. His .783 won- loss percentage led the American League pitchers. He faded to 6–8 in 1949 and was sold the New York Giants for $25‚000. Eventually, Kramer will charge the Red Sox with railroading him out of the league because of his differences with manager Joe McCarthy. He went 1–3 for the Giants (1950–51) and 1–3 with the Yankees (1951). Although he pitched with both pennant-winners in 1951, he did not last to the World Series with either. In a 12-season career, Kramer posted a 95–103 record with 613 strikeouts and a 4.24 ERA in 322 appearances, including 215 starts, 88 complete games, 14 shutouts, seven saves and 1637 innings of work. He also helped himself with the bat, hitting .144 (72-for-501) with five home runs, 39 RBI and 76 bases on balls. Kramer died in Metairie, Louisiana at age 77.

It is a fishing sport anime that teaches audiences fishing methods. The target of this anime is usually families and children; it teaches them to appreciate nature and not destroy it. The main theme is protecting Mother Earth from being destroyed by technology and the greed of humans. It has influenced many audiences to fish for sport, as well as giving a good message to preserve nature. Grander Musashi is supported by the Fishing Club in Japan, and in the ending credits it shows a gallery of the bass fish they captured. Plot The series is divided into two seasons: Grander Musashi and Grander Musashi RV. =Grander Musashi= Musashi lives with his father. His mother left them three years ago, but Musashi believes she will come back. One day they move from Tokyo to a village in the countryside. Musashi hates living in the countryside and asks his father to take him back to Tokyo. He wonders if his mother will be able to find him in their new home. Soon after moving to the countryside, Musashi happens to see a man fishing for bass with a decoy fish. Musashi is fascinated by lure fishing. He learns a lot from the man and discovers that his mother's father was a grand champion of bass fishing. Musashi feels that fishing could lead him to his missing mother. He shows a marvelous talent for lure fishing and takes trips with his new friends, Mio and Suguru, to many places around the world in search of incredible fish. Through fishing, Musashi comes to enjoy living amongst nature. =Grander Musashi RV= Musashi Kazama and his two friends, Mio and Suguru, continue their journey traveling around the world in search of seven mysterious objects of fantastic power called \\"Legenders\\" — legendary lures in the form of a fish that give more power to attract fish. However, if it uses too much power, it will either cause destruction or hope. Legenders are said to grant anyone who catches them the power to change the world. Unfortunately, Musashi ends up competing with several other fishermen who share his ambition of capturing a Legender. Tournament Every fisher in the world dreams to become the best. To gain the title, each fisher has to go around the world and capture the biggest and best quality of bass. This is the hardest challenge because bass fish like to be in quiet places and are not easily tricked by any lure. The challenge gets tougher when the place is unstable, whether it is caused by nature or by the fisher themselves. Fishers must use their best techniques combined with their lures and their angler strength to win the tournament. Legenders *Hawk Legender — Works best in sunlight. It has sharp, gripping hooks to prevent fish from escaping. It can control sunlight power. *God Legender — The most powerful Legender. It can catch any kind of fish, no matter what the weather conditions are or how fast the fish is. It can control other Legenders. *Shark Legender — A lure with deadly speed in water but has fragile hooks that cannot reel in any fish heavier than 50 pounds. It can control the wood power. *Scissor Legender — Shaped like a crab, it has retractable pincer-like hooks and can catch more than one fish. It can control moon power. *Dragon Legender — A very long lure. Its segmented parts can make it look like living bait in the water, raising the chances of catching a fish quickly and easily. It can control rain power. *Spider Legender — Works best in muddy water. It can break through the hard mud pots that some fish hide in. It can control earth power. *Angel/Devil Legender — Formerly a very dangerous lure with very sharp hooks, it changes into a safer lure when it is used with the intention of pure fishing, not hurting other fishers. Fishers *Musashi Kazama (voiced by Urara Takano) **Main lure: King Orcaizer **Legenders: Hawk, God :Musashi is an honorable fisherman who loves and cares greatly about fish. He always cares for Mother Nature like BB and Hattori, but he rarely thinks ahead, and can be reckless with his lures. He's always excited to fish, and loves to compete with others so long as everyone is having fun. As he gets more experience, he comes to understand his Legenders, thus becoming the legendary fisher. He is best friends with Suguru and Mio. *BB (voiced by Megumi Tano) **Main lure: Dragon **Legender: Dragon :BB is usually very protective of Mother Nature. She is Musashi's rival competitor and Suguru's love interest. BB believed in her Dragon lure and even cared for it, unlike Musashi who was reckless and thoughtless with his Legender Hawk. She defeated Musashi in a battle to gain the second Legender, but at the price of her Dragon lure being destroyed. However, when she was granted her own Legender, it turned out that her Dragon lure was actually one part of the Legender before they were split apart, and they combined again to create the Dragon Legender. *Carl Amann (voiced by Hiro Yūki) **Main lure: Giga Bass **Legender: Shark :Carl is ruthless, hot-tempered, and has very little patience. He doesn't mind interfering with other fishers and has no concern for Mother Nature or other people. He didn't learn to value life until he met Marlene. With Marlene's help, Carl finally caught his own Legender, but at the cost of Marlene's life. When Carl witnessed Marlene's sacrifice that led to her death, he finally understood how important life was; thus, he swore to honor her memory. Afterward, the third Legender Carl caught transformed into a lure called Shark. *Yun (voiced by Yoshiko Kamei) **Main Lure: Top Clarken **Legender: Scissor :Yun is always deceitful, and he doesn't fight fairly. He considers himself to be a loner and does not want any friends except his pet. However, he became fond of Mio, and he opened up about his origins to her. With the aid of Mio, Musashi, and Suguru, he was able to win his own Legender in Australia. When Yun received the fifth Legender, he was reluctant to open his hands, fearing it might be a Devil Legender. Encouraged by Mio, Musashi, and Suguru, he opened his hands to reveal his Legender was a Scissor. Yun rejoiced as he knew he earned the Legender. *Masatsugu Hattori (voiced by Katashi Ishizuka) **Main lure: G-Cobra **Legender: Spider :Hattori is a trained ninja with a code of honor. He is deeply concerned for Mother Nature and has a sense of fair play. Despite being rivals, Hattori always watches out for Musashi, and has occasionally saved his life. Hattori battled with Kuki Jr. in a fight to claim the sixth Legender because he had to protect the fish from Kuki's reckless ravages. He won the battle with the combined aid of Musashi, BB, Carl, Yun, Suguru, and Mio, and thus earned his own Legender. Yun commented that it is a fitting lure for a ninja. *Kuki Jr. (voiced by Kōsuke Okano) **Main lure: Skeleton Minnow **Legender: Devil/Angel :Kuki Jr. is the son of Kuki Sr., who was once Musashi's mentor and enemy. Kuki Jr. is ruthless and does not object to using underhanded tricks or deceptions to win his fights. He claimed his own Legender while competing with his rivals, although he did not earn it fairly. Kuki Jr.'s Legender was a Devil Legender, which then possessed him. When he competed with Musashi for a final time and refused to let his Legender kill Musashi, his change of heart transformed his lure into an Angel Legender. Supporting characters *Mio (voiced by Maya Okamoto) :A friend of Musashi. She has supported him ever since they met in their village's school, and constantly looks out for him and Suguru. She gets jealous of any new girl Musashi encounters, as shown in the Dragon Legender Arc in the RV saga, but that jealousy quickly fades when she becomes friends with them as well. She is also Yun's friend, and believed in his innocence in stealing Kuki's lure. *Suguru (voiced by Kouji Tsujitani) :Another friend of Musashi. A big eater who's smart when it comes to knowing about fish. Sometimes he argues with Musashi, but is always willing to help him when he needs it. He also makes most of Musashi's lures in the first season, and makes a lure for BB in the second season. Suguru has a crush on BB, Musashi's rival. *Jim (voiced by Kouji Tsujitani) :Mentor and friend to Musashi, as well as his guardian in \\"RV\\". He taught all the basic moves Musashi uses and always gives him advice in order to excel in fishing. He was also Musashi's first introduction to fishing in season one back when Musashi's father relocated them to the countryside.

News.mongabay.com Between 2000 and 2005 the country lost 55.7% of its primary forests, and the rate of forest change increased by 31.2% to 3.12% per annum. Forest has been cleared for logging, timber export, subsistence agriculture and notably the collection of wood for fuel which remains problematic in western Africa. In 2005 12.2%, the equivalent of had been forested in Nigeria. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.38%. Between 1990 and 2005, in total Nigeria lost 35.7% of its forest cover, or around 6,145,000 hectares. Details Deforestation is a process where vegetation is cut down without any simultaneous replanting for economic or social reasons. Deforestation has negative implications on the environment in terms of soil erosion, loss of biodiversity ecosystems, loss of wildlife and increased desertification among many other reasons. Deforestation also has impacts on social aspects of the country, specifically regarding economic issues, agriculture, conflict and most importantly, quality of life. According to data taken over 2000 to 2005 Nigeria, located in the western region of Africa, has the largest deforestation rates in the world, having lost 55.7% of their primary forests. Mongabay defines primary forests as forests with no visible signs of past or present human activities. The annual rate of deforestation in Nigeria is 3.5%, approximately 350,000-400,000 hectares per year.http://www.pgrfa.org/gpa/nga/Nigeria2.pdf>. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations lists the requirements of sustainable forest management as: extent of forest resources, biological diversity, forest health and vitality, productive functions of forest resources, protective functions of forest resources, socio-economic functions and a legal, policy and institutional framework. Many aspects of the outline are currently not being met and will continue to have detrimental effects if not quickly addressed. A lot of damage has been done to Nigeria’s land through the processes of deforestation, notably contributing to the overwhelming trend of desertification. Desertification is the encroachment of the desert on land what was once fertile.Omofonmwan, S. I., and G. I. Osa-Edoh. \\"The Challenges of Environmental Problems in Nigeria.\\" Journal of Human Ecology 23.1 (2008): 53-57. A study conducted from 1901 to 2005 gathered that there was a temperature increase in Nigeria of 1.1 °C, while the global mean temperature increase was only 0.74 °C. The same study also found in the same period of time that the amount of rainfall in the country decreased by 81mm. It was noticed that both of these trends simultaneously had sharp changes in the 1970s.Odjugo, Peter A. \\"General Overview of Climate Change Impacts in Nigeria.\\" Journal of Human Ecology 29.1 (2010): 47-55. EBSCO. From 1990 to 2010 Nigeria nearly halved their amount of forest cover, moving from 17,234 to 9041 hectares. The combination of extremely high deforestation rates, increased temperatures and decreasing rainfall are all contributing to the desertification of the country. The carbon emissions from deforestation is also said to account for 87% of the total carbon emissions of the country.Akinbami, J. \\"An Integrated Strategy for Sustainable Forest–energy–environment Interactions in Nigeria.\\" Journal of Environmental Management 69.2 (2003): 115-28. Science Direct Nigeria’s wide biodiversity of 899 species of birds, 274 mammals, 154 reptiles, 53 amphibians and 4,715 species of higher plants will also be strongly affected by the negative impacts of deforestation. The numbers of the rare Cross River gorilla have decreased to around 300 individuals because of poaching by locals and mass habitat destruction.http://news.mongabay.com/2007/1205-gorillas.html Although much of the motivation of deforestation stems from economic reasons it has also led to a lot of economic problems in an already unstable country. Along with economic issues, deforestation has made it so that the land is incapable of as much agricultural production which is part of many people’s survival. Issues such as these and the subject of the environment itself has contributed to many conflicts in the country and even executions of environmental activists, such as Ken Saro-Wiwa, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee. Much of the allowance for deforestation in Nigeria comes from their demand for fuel wood. 90% of the Nigerian population stated that they relied on kerosene as the main energy source for cooking but because it is expensive and often unavailable, 60% said they used fuel wood instead. The usage of fuel wood for cooking is higher in rural areas of the country where more of the population is concentrated.Akinbami, J. \\"An Integrated Strategy for Sustainable Forest–energy–environment Interactions in Nigeria.\\" Journal of Environmental Management 69.2 (2003): 115-28. Science Direct. There are also incentives to people living in rural areas surrounding the process of deforestation because it is a source of income to many of them. They extremely high levels of poverty in the country are very much connected to the issue of deforestation. The current state of the environment and has been allowed by the State Department of Forestry who have not implemented any forest management policies in efforts to curb deforestation since the 1970s.http://www.pgrfa.org/gpa/nga/Nigeria2.pdf Without any conservation efforts or education, the society is not aware of how to properly treat finite natural resources. Very few steps have been made to try to lower the deforestation rates and to stop illegal logging. Any solution to the problem of deforestation in Nigeria must be an approach that incorporates and aggressively targets all aspects that are related to the problem. Teach each should include areas of energy alternatives, improved technology, forestry management, economic production, agriculture and security of the locals that are dependent on the land. Energy alternatives include hydro power, solar energy and wind energy. Solar energy is a great option for Nigeria and will have exceptional results due to its geographical location. Nigeria has already implemented windmills in some of its states but the more this approach is taken on the more energy that will be produced in an environmentally sound and efficient way. Each of these proposals is accepted globally as good alternatives to current energy production methods and have been encouraged by many environmental organizations. Improving the technology of cook stoves will be especially effective for Nigeria which currently has many households that require fuel wood for their cooking methods. In 2005 a group of countries, called the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, developed a program to reduce the rates of deforestation that contribute to CO2 emissions. The program is designed for all developing countries with a rainforest. The developing countries receive money upon successful completion of lowering their country’s emissions. A similar concept has been designed by REDD, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries. In REDD the countries are able to receive much more money in the form of carbon credits which can be spent on more environmentally safe practices. Deforestation all over the globe is threatening the sustainability of the environment but has had especially detrimental effects in Nigeria due to their high rates. Deforestation puts at risk all aspects of the environment, the economy and of the citizens of the country. Nigeria is home to 1417 known species of fauna and at least 4715 species of vascular plants according to figures from the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Although national parks and reserves have increased in the country only 3.6% of Nigeria is protected under IUCN categories I-V.

A spike-and-wave discharge is a regular, symmetrical, generalized EEG pattern seen particularly during absence epilepsy, also known as ‘petit mal’ epilepsy. The basic mechanisms underlying these patterns are complex and involve part of the cerebral cortex, the thalamocortical network, and intrinsic neuronal mechanisms. The first spike-and-wave pattern was recorded in the early twentieth century by Hans Berger. Many aspects of the pattern are still being researched and discovered, and still many aspects are uncertain. The spike- and-wave pattern is most commonly researched in absence epilepsy, but is common in several epilepsies such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Ohtahara syndrome. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly prescribed to treat epileptic seizures, and new ones are being discovered with fewer adverse effects. Today, most of the research is focused on the origin of the generalized bilateral spike-and-wave discharge. One proposal suggests that a thalamocortical (TC) loop is involved in the initiation spike-and-wave oscillations. Although there are several theories, the use of animal models has provided new insight on spike-and-wave discharge in humans. History History of generalized epilepsy with absence seizures are dated to the eighteenth century, however the inventor of the electroencephalogram (EEG), Hans Berger, recorded the first EEG of an absence seizure in the 1920s, which led the way for the general notion of spike-and-wave electrophysiology. His first recording of a human EEG was made in 1924 using a galvanometer, but his results were very crude and showed small, undefined oscillations. He continued to refine his technique and increase the sensitivity to the galvanometer, in which he accumulated many EEGs of individuals with and without a brain malfunction or disorder. Among those tested were patients with epilepsy, dementia, and brain tumors. Hans Berger published his findings in 1933, however his results did not give a definitive characterization of the general EEG pattern seen during an epileptic seizure. In 1935, F.A. Gibbs, H. Davis, and W.G. Lennox provided a clear description of EEG spike-and-wave patterns during a petit mal epileptic seizure. An intracellular recording performed by DA Pollen in 1964 revealed that the \\"spike\\" aspect of the phenomenon was associated with neuronal firing and the \\"wave\\" aspect was associated with hyperpolarization. Pathophysiology A drawing of the human brain showing the thalamus and cortex relative to other structures. The spike-and-wave pattern seen during an absence seizure is the result of a bilateral synchronous firing of neurons ranging from the neocortex (part of the cerebral cortex) to the thalamus, along the thalamocortical network. The EEG “spike” of the spike-and-wave complex corresponds to the depolarization of the neuronal membrane potential, also called a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS). The initial understanding behind the mechanism of the PDS was that it was caused by a very large EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) in the absence of synaptic inhibition, which relayed the action potentials in the neurons by triggering activation of voltage-gated channels. The voltage-gated sodium channels cause transitory sodium current into the cell, which generates the action potential. The voltage-gated calcium channels also have some effect on the depolarization of the cell, but the effect is minimal compared to the sodium channels. However, the increasing concentration of intracellular calcium leads to greater activation of calcium-activated potassium channels. These calcium-activated potassium channels, along with the voltage-gated potassium channels, contribute to the repolarization and hyperpolarization of the membrane. In an epileptic seizure, there are periods of a sustained depolarization, which cause a train of action potentials followed by a repolarization and hyperpolarization phase. The train of action potentials constitutes the “spike” phase, and the repolarization and hyperpolarization constitute the “wave” phase. Although there is evidence for the generation of a large EPSP, many studies have shown that synaptic inhibition remains functional during the generation of these types of paroxysmal depolarizing shifts. Also, it has been shown that a decrease in the inhibitory activity does not affect neocortical kindling. Therefore, the theory that spike-and- wave activity is caused by a giant EPSP due to the decrease or the absence of IPSPs (inhibitory postsynaptic potentials) is not accepted as a general mechanism for epileptic activity. Many studies have shown that the inhibitory postsynaptic signaling is actually increased during these epileptic attacks. The activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors leads to an increase in the intracellular chloride concentration, which in non-epileptic situations would lead to an IPSP. However, in seizure-related depolarizing shifts, there is a substantial activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, which leads to an even larger concentration of intracellular chloride concentration. This change in ion concentration gradient causes the GABAA inhibitory current to surpass the reversal potential, leading to an efflux of the chloride ions. This leads to a decreased amplitude or even reversed polarity of the IPSPs. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the thalamocortical network have also shown to display some role in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with absence epilepsy. The different subtypes of mGlu receptors have a modulatory role on either excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. There are conflicting hypotheses for the function of the many mGlu receptors with regards to epileptic seizures, however the role of the mGlu4 receptor is undisputed in the generation of SWDs, shown in animal models. In one study, knockout mice lacking mGlu4 receptors showed a disruption of glutamate and GABA release in the thalamocortical network and were resistant to absence seizures induced by low doses of pentylenetetrazole. Another study showed that bilateral injection of a mGlu4 receptor antagonist into the nRT (thalamic reticular nucleus) of normal mice protected against pentylenetetrazole induced seizures. Also, WAG/Rij rats show an increased expression of mGlu4 receptors in the nRT when compared to a control group of normal rats. These studies show that an increase in the expression and/or activity of mGlu4 receptors is associated with spike-and-wave discharges seen in absence seizures. This link between mGlur4 receptors and SWDs has led to the search for a selective mGlu4 receptor antagonist (which will block these receptors) as a potential new drug for the treatment of absence epilepsy. =Initiation factors = The use of animal models, such as cats, for studying spike-and-wave discharges, has provided useful data for studying epilepsy in humans. One method of inducing a seizure in a cat is to inject penicillin into the cortical region of the brain. The spike-and-wave discharges seen in feline generalized penicillin epilepsy (FGPE) are very similar to the spike-and-wave discharges of a human absence seizure. The use of rats has also been a common method for studying the spike-and-wave phenomenon. The Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and the inbred Wistar Albino Glaxo rats from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) are the two main strains of rats that have been used in studies. The rats from these two strains show spontaneously occurring absence seizures that consist of typical spike-and-wave activity seen on an EEG. Rat genetic models have given data showing that the expression of absence seizures involves both the thalamic and cortical networks. In both models, electrophysiological data showed that spike-and-waves are initiated in the somatosensory cortex and then spread rapidly to the motor cortex and thalamic nuclei. Using in vivo intracellular recordings, it was found in the GAERS that spike-and-wave are initiated in layer 5/6 neurons of the somatosensory cortex. These neurons, show a distinctive hyperactivity associated with a membrane depolarization. They are suggested to lead the firing of distant cortical cells during the epileptic discharge. Another possible initiation pattern tested in rats suggested the thalamocortical (TC) loop is involved in the initiation of spike-and-wave oscillations under certain conditions. In this study, relay and reticular thalamic neurons of epileptic and non-epileptic rats were dual extracellularly recorded and juxtacellularly labeled. Medium oscillations (5–9 Hz) in both types of rats were noted to occur randomly in an unsynchronized pattern in relay and reticular neurons. However, spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges were observed in epileptic rats when the medium oscillations became synchronized, suggesting a dependence of the two. However, since medium ranged oscillations only developed into spike-and-wave discharges spontaneously, genetic factors also seem to contribute to the initiation of synchronized oscillations. These genetic factors may contribute to spike-and- wave oscillations by decreasing the action potential threshold in reticular cells, making them more excitable and potentially easier to initiate synchronized firing. Another study has shown that these medium oscillations have led to spike-and-wave discharges. The activity of the primary and secondary cortical regions, as well as the adjacent insular cortex were recorded using an EEG and where applied with electrical stimulation. The findings here showed that the onset of spike-and-wave discharged were followed by 5–9 Hz oscillations in these cortical regions as well. =Genetic/developmental factors= Elongator Protein Complex 4 (ELP4) has been identified as a key component in the transcription of genes known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell motility and migration of neurons. Research on ELP4 has been linked the gene to a centrotemporal sharp spike phenotype. Hypotheses have been made that a mutation in the non-coding region of the ELP4 gene may interfere with elongo-mediated gene interaction, specifically during the developmental stages of the cortical region. This mutation may be responsible for a predisposition to spike-and-wave discharges, as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders. Another study revealed that glucose may also be relevant to spike-and-wave occurrence in mice that contained a knock-in of the human GABA(A) γ2(R43Q) mutation, which has been known to be a genetic factor involved in the causation of absence epilepsy. These absence seizure prone mice were injected with insulin to lower blood glucose levels by 40%. This reduction in blood glucose led to double the occurrence of spike-and-wave activity. Similar to the insulin effect, overnight fasting, where blood glucose levels were reduced by 35% also showed this double in occurrence. This model concludes that low glucose levels could be a potential trigger for absence seizures, and could be an environmental risk factor for humans. Spike-and-wave in epilepsy =Absence epilepsy= Bursts of generalized spike-and-wave discharges lasting two seconds or longer is considered an absence seizure. Absence seizures are generalized epileptic seizures that can be divided into two types, typical and atypical. Typical and atypical absence seizures display two different kinds of spike-and-wave patterns. Typical absence seizures are described by generalized spike-and-wave patterns on an EEG with a discharge of 2.5 Hz or greater. They can be characterized by an increase in synchronization of discharges in the thalamocortical circuitry. They can also be characterized by the acute onset and termination of the seizure. Atypical absence seizures have a higher frequency in children with severe epilepsy that suffer from multiple types of seizures. The spike-and-wave pattern seen here is more irregular than the generalized pattern and also seems to be slower. This irregular pattern is due to non-synchronous discharges of the thalamocortical circuitry. The onset and termination in these atypical absence seizures seem to be less acute than the typical absence seizures. =Lennox-Gastaut syndrome= Epileptic encephalopathies are a group of conditions that result in deterioration of sensory, cognitive, and motor functions due to consistent epileptic activity. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy characterized with generalized seizures and slow spike-wave activity while awake. LGS is a combination of atonic absences, tonic seizures, cognitive deterioration, and slow spike-wave activity in the EEG. This syndrome usually results from focal, multifocal, or diffuse brain damage and can be divided into symptomatic and cryptogenic types. Cognitive deterioration with high- frequency spike-wave activity affects most patients 2–9 years old with generalized seizures. The age of onset for LGS is between 1 and 10 years, between 2 and 6 years for symptomatic cases and 5 and 8 years for cryptogenic cases. Episodes can be triggered by modifications of treatment, which usually involves benzodiazepines, or changes in the conditions of life. =Ohtahara syndrome= Ohtahara syndrome (OS), also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) with suppression-burst (S-B), is the most severe and the earliest-developing epileptic encephalopathy in children. This syndrome is characterized on an EEG by high voltage bursts and slow waves mixed with multifocal spikes alternating with almost flat suppression phases. The S-B will gradually begin to taper away at 3 months and disappear by 6 months. OS will transition to West syndrome or LGS with age. Tonic spasms are the main seizures observed in OS. Unlike LGS, the spike-and-wave pattern is consistent during both waking and sleeping states. Symptoms of OS include: *Genetic defects *Mitochondrial disease **Mitochondrial respiratory chain defects *Inborn errors of metabolism **Glycine encephalopathy *Cortical malformations **Cerebral asymmetry **Posterior fossa anomalies **Agenesis of mammillary bodies *Frequent minor generalized seizures *Severe and continuous epileptic EEG abnormality *Severe psychomotor prognosis =Spike-and-wave pattern during sleep= In continuous spike-and-wave syndrome (CSWS), a rare form of age- related epilepsy, children between the ages of three and seven exhibit continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow-sleep. This disorder is found in 0.2–0.5% of all child epilepsy cases. This disorder's discharges rarely result in absence seizures, but motor impairment and neurophysiological regression have been found in CSWS. Spike-and-wave activity occupies about 85% of the non-rapid eye movement sleep. This continuous pattern during sleep, like other aspects of spike-and-wave activity, are not completely understood either. However, what is hypothesized is that corticothalamic neuronal network that is involved in oscillating sleep patterns may begin to function as a pathologic discharging source. =Clinical relevance= Reoccurrence after a solitary unprovoked seizure in children is about 50%, so the use of anti- epileptic drugs (AEDs) is very prevalent. AEDs aim to slow down the excess firing, associated with spike-and-wave discharges, at the beginning of seizures. They can bring about serious adverse drug reactions so physicians need to be aware of the safety and admissibility for each drug. These adverse effects are a major source of disability, morbidity, and mortality. Some of the adverse effects, such as serious cutaneous, haematological and hepatic events, usually require withdrawal in children and place a heavy burden on the costs of healthcare. Bromide was introduced as the first anti-epileptic drug 150 years ago. Because of the adverse effects mentioned above, bromide is not currently in use as an AED. Early treatment discontinuation was occurring far too frequently and eventually resulted in negative effects on several patients. Current treatment options include phenytoin, valproic acid, ethosuximide, and the new anti-epileptic drugs. Over the past 20 years, 15 new anti-epileptic drugs with positive outcomes have been introduced to the public. These new AEDs are aimed at improving the cost-benefit balance in AED therapy, improving tolerability profiles and reducing potential for drug interaction. Despite these major advances, there is always room for improvement, especially regarding the tailored treatment of individuals who have suffered adverse effects from older AEDs.

The film chronicles the origins and meaning of life by way of a middle-aged man's childhood memories of his family living in 1950s Texas, interspersed with imagery of the origins of the known universe and the inception of life on Earth. After several years in development and missing its planned 2009 and 2010 release dates, The Tree of Life premiered in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded the Palme d'Or. It ranked number one on review aggregator Metacritic's \\"Top Ten List of 2011\\", and made more critics' year-end lists for 2011 than any other film. It appeared in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the world's top 250 films as well as BBC's poll of the greatest American films, one of the few 21st- century works to be included in either. The film was also later named the seventh-greatest film since 2000 in a BBC poll of 177 critics. In December 2019, The Tree of Life topped The Associated Press' list of the best films of the 2010s. The Tree of Life received three Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography. Plot The film begins with a quotation from the Book of Job: \\"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\\" (Job 38.4, 7). Afterwards, a mysterious, flame-like light flickers in the darkness. Mrs. O'Brien recalls a lesson that people must choose to follow either the path of grace or the path of nature. Around the 1960s, Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien are separately informed of the death of their son, R.L., aged nineteen. The family is thrown into turmoil. In the present day, the O'Briens' eldest son, Jack, is adrift in his modern life as an architect. One day he apologizes to his father on the phone for something he said about R.L.'s death. In his office, Jack begins reflecting. From the darkness the universe is born, the Milky Way and then the solar system form. On the newly formed Earth, volcanoes erupt and microbes begin to form and replicate. Sea life is born, then plants on land, then dinosaurs. In a symbolic first act of compassion, a dinosaur chooses not to kill another dinosaur that is injured and lying on the side of a river bed. An asteroid strikes the Earth, causing the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. In a suburban neighborhood in the American South live the O'Briens. The young couple is enthralled by their new baby Jack and, later, his two brothers. When Jack reaches adolescence, he is faced with the conflict of accepting the way of grace or nature, as embodied by each of his parents. Mrs. O'Brien is gentle, nurturing, and authoritative, presenting the world to her children as a place of wonder. Mr. O'Brien is strict and authoritarian, and easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. He laments his decision to work in a power plant instead of pursuing his passion for music, and tries to get ahead by filing patents for various inventions. Jack's perceptions of the world begin to change after one of his friends drowns and another is burned in a fire. He becomes angry at his father's bullying behavior and begins to keep a running tally of Mr. O'Brien's hypocrisies and misdeeds, lashing out at his mother for tolerating such abusive behavior. One summer, Mr. O'Brien takes a long business trip. While he is away, the boys enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass, and eventually throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Shortly after Mr. O'Brien returns, the plant that he works at closes; he is given the option of relocating to work in an inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person, and asking Jack to forgive his harsh and domineering behavior. In the present, Jack leaves work. Riding the elevator up, he experiences a vision of following a young girl across rocky terrain. As Jack walks through a wooden door frame erected on the rocks, he sees a view of the far distant future in which the sun expands into a red giant, engulfing Earth and then shrinking into a white dwarf. Someone says \\"follow me\\" in the darkness, and candles are lit. After emerging from rustic doors, Jack follows the girl, then a young version of himself, across surreal landscapes. On a sandbar, Jack sees images of the dead returning to life. He is reunited with his family and all the people who populate his memory. Jack encounters his young brother and brings him to his parents, who say goodbye to him as he steps out of a home into a vast expanse. Accompanied by a woman in white and another young woman, Mrs. O'Brien looks to the sky and whispers, \\"I give him to you. I give you my son.\\" Jack's vision ends and he leaves the building smiling, while nature returns to the surrounding buildings as the sky is reflected in them. The film ends as the mysterious wavering light continues to flicker in the darkness.

Malick had an idea for a film that would be \\"a history of the cosmos up through the formation of the Earth and the beginnings of life.\\" The film was known as Q and included elements not in The Tree of Life such as a section set in the Middle East during World War I, and an underwater minotaur dreaming about the evolution of the universe. One day, Malick \\"just stopped\\" working on the film. Decades later, Terrence Malick pitched the concept of The Tree of Life to River Road Entertainment head Bill Pohlad while the two were collaborating on an early version of Che. Pohlad recalls initially thinking the idea was \\"crazy,\\" but as the film concept evolved, he came to feel strongly about the idea; he ended up financing the film. Producer Grant Hill was also involved with the film at an early stage. During a meeting on a different subject involving Malick, his producer Sarah Green, Brad Pitt, and Pitt's Plan B Entertainment production partner Dede Gardner, Malick brought up Tree of Life and the difficulties it was having getting made. It was \\"much later on\\" that the decision was made for Pitt to be part of the cast. The Tree of Life was announced in late 2005, with Indian production company Percept Picture Company set to finance it and Donald Rosenfeld on board as executive producer. The film was set to be shot partially in India, with pre-production scheduled to begin in January 2006. Colin Farrell and Mel Gibson were at one stage attached to the project. Heath Ledger was set to play the role of Mr. O'Brien, but dropped out (due to recurring sicknesses) a month before his death in early 2008. For the roles of the three brothers, the production team spent over a year, seeing over 10,000 Texas students for the roles. About 95% of the entire cast had no prior acting experience. In an October 2008 interview Jack Fisk, a longtime Malick collaborator, suggested that the director was attempting something radical. He also implied that details of the film were a close secret. In March 2009, visual effects artist Mike Fink revealed to Empire magazine that he was working on scenes of prehistoric Earth for the film.Exclusive: Malick's Tree Of Life. Empire. Retrieved December 22, 2010. The similarity of the scenes Fink describes to descriptions of a hugely ambiguous project entitled Q that Malick worked on soon after Days of Heaven led to speculation that The Tree of Life is a resurrection of that abandoned project.Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE To Go IMAX? With Dinosaurs?, aintitcool.com, March 2, 2009164x164px =Filming= Principal photography began in Texas in 2008. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki returned to work with Malick after collaborating with him on The New World. The film was shot in 1.85:1 and often used natural light. The film used the 35mm, 65mm, and IMAX formats. Locations included Smithville, Houston, Matagorda, Bastrop, Austin, Dallas, and Malick's hometown of Waco. The namesake of the film is a large live oak tree that was excavated from a property eight miles outside Smithville. The 65,000-pound tree and root ball were trucked into Smithville and replanted.Hagerty, Terry. \\"Oak in 'Tree of Life' moved to downtown Smithville\\". The Bastrop Advertiser, February 9, 2008, pp 1A, 2A. The sets for The Tree of Life were unusual for a large scale film. According to Brad Pitt, \\"A movie set is very chaotic. There [are] hundreds of people; there [are] generators and trucks. And this was a completely different experience — we had none of that.\\" \\"There were no [camera] lights ... there were no generators and the camera was all hand-held so it was a very free- form, low-key experience.\\" Malick would change different aspects of a scene between takes in order to create \\"moments of truth\\". = Editing = Similar to many of Malick's films, the film had \\"teams of editors to put together different cuts, and finding and discarding entire story lines during the post- production process.\\" Malick used \\"unorthodox methods to edit the film\\". One of the film's editors, Billy Weber said “Terry is willing to try anything. Absolutely anything. Sometimes we’d cut a character out of a scene, or cut all the dialogue out of a scene, just to see if it worked. And when you’ve worked with him for any length of time, you can even try that without asking him about it first. He’s very open to looking at anything that you try.” This includes allowing film students from USC and University of Texas, as well as interns, to play a part in the editing process. Some of them stayed on the film the whole time. In an unused ending for the film, Jack arrives as a boarding student at St. Stephen's Episcopal School, which Malick attended in the 1950s. =Visual effects= After nearly thirty years away from Hollywood, famed special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull contributed to the visual effects work on The Tree of Life. Malick, a friend of Trumbull, approached him about the effects work and mentioned that he did not like the look of computer-generated imagery. Trumbull asked Malick, \\"Why not do it the old way? The way we did it in 2001?\\" 127x127px Working with visual effects supervisor Dan Glass, Trumbull used a variety of materials for the creation of the universe sequence. \\"We worked with chemicals, paint, fluorescent dyes, smoke, liquids, CO2, flares, spin dishes, fluid dynamics, lighting and high speed photography to see how effective they might be,\\" said Trumbull. \\"It was a free-wheeling opportunity to explore, something that I have found extraordinarily hard to get in the movie business. Terry didn't have any preconceived ideas of what something should look like. We did things like pour milk through a funnel into a narrow trough and shoot it with a high-speed camera and folded lens, lighting it carefully and using a frame rate that would give the right kind of flow characteristics to look cosmic, galactic, huge and epic.\\" The team also included Double Negative in London. Fluid-based effects were developed by Peter and Chris Parks, who had previously worked on similar effects for The Fountain. A column in The New Yorker noted that the film credited Thomas Wilfred’s lumia composition Opus 161, and that this was the source of the \\"shifting flame of red-yellow light\\" at the beginning and the end.  Themes  = Philosophical = Many reviewers have noted the philosophical and theological themes of the film. For instance, Catholic author and now auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles Fr. Robert Barron, reviewing The Tree of Life for a Chicago Tribune blog, noted that \\"in the play of good and evil, in the tension between nature and grace, God is up to something beautiful, though we are unable to grasp it totally...“Tree of Life” is communicating this same difficult but vital lesson.\\" America (magazine) called the film \\"a philosophical exploration of grief, theodicy and the duality of grace and human nature\\". They described the final beach scene as \\"the greatest film depiction of eschatological bodily resurrection\\". Rabbi David Wolpe says \\"that Terrence Malick's new film \\"Tree of Life\\" opens with a quotation from Job. That quotation holds the key to the film and in some sense, the key to our attitude toward life.\\" He added that \\"The agony of the parents, the periodic cruelty of the father — all are the powerful but passing dramas that for the moment entirely preoccupy us as we watch the movie. But then we are drawn back to a world so much bigger than our hour upon the stage that we know again how essentially small is each human story.\\" According to Bob Mondello, the film is showing that \\"to understand the death of a young man, we need to understand everything that led to his creation, starting with creation itself.\\" Kristen Scharold compared the film to Augustine's Confessions, and noted how one voiceover is nearly identical to a quote from Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. = Nature and Grace = Many have said that Mr. O'Brien represents the way of nature, while Mrs. O'Brien represents the way of grace. Brad Pitt said Mr. O'Brien \\"represents nature — but nature as that oppressive force that will choke another plant out for its own survival.\\" \\"The American dream didn't work out as he believed it would. [He's] quite envious and bitter that people are ahead of him. Naturally, when someone feels oppressed, they find someone weaker to pass that oppression on[to], and the sadness in this situation [is] it's on his sons.\\" = Autobiographical = Many reviewers have noted the similarities between Jack's life and Terrence Malick's life. Jim Lynch, a close friend of Malick, told Malick that he thought The Tree of Life, Knight of Cups, and Song to Song, formed an \\"autobiographical trilogy\\". Lynch said Malick disliked the labeling and \\"didn’t want people thinking that he was just making movies about himself. He was making movies about broader issues.” Release In March 2009, Empire magazine's website quoted visual effects supervisor Mike Fink as saying that a version of the film will be released for IMAX cinemas along with two versions for traditional cinemas. The IMAX film has been revealed to be Voyage of Time, a documentary expanding on the \\"history of the universe\\" scenes in The Tree of Life, which the producers decided to focus on releasing at a later date so as not to cannibalize its release. It was released in IMAX in the United States on October 7, 2016 by Broad Green Pictures. =Delays and distribution problems= By May 2009, The Tree of Life had been sold to a number of international distributors, including EuropaCorp in France, TriPictures in Spain, and Icon in the United Kingdom and Australia, but lacked a US distributor. In August 2009, it was announced that the film would be released in the US through Apparition, a new distributor founded by River Road Entertainment head Bill Pohlad and former Picturehouse chief Bob Berney. A tentative date of December 25, 2009 was announced, but the film was not completed in time. Organisers of the Cannes Film Festival made negotiations to secure a premiere at Cannes 2010, resulting in Malick sending an early version of the film to Thierry Fremaux and the Cannes selection committee. Though Fremaux warmly received the cut and was eager to screen the film at his festival, Malick ultimately told him that he felt the film was not ready. On the eve of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Berney suddenly announced his departure from Apparition, leaving the company's future uncertain. Pohlad decided to keep The Tree of Life at Apparition, and after significant restructuring, hired Tom Ortenberg to act as a consultant on its release. A tentative plan was made to release it in late 2010, in time for awards consideration. Ultimately, Pohlad decided to close Apparition and sell rights to the film. Private screenings of the film to interested parties Fox Searchlight Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics took place at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival. On September 9, Fox Searchlight announced their acquisition of the film from Pohlad's River Road Entertainment. The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 27, 2011. On March 28, 2011, UK magazine Empire reported that UK distributor Icon Entertainment was planning to release the film on May 4, 2011. This would make the UK the first region in the world to see the film, preempting the expected Cannes Film Festival premiere on May 11. This would disqualify the film from inclusion at Cannes. As a result, a surge of interest in the story developed on international film news sites. After film blogger Jeff Wells was told by a Fox Searchlight representative that this was \\"unlikely\\", and Anne Thompson received similar word from Searchlight and outright denial from Summit, Helen O'Hara from Empire received a confirmation from Icon that they intended to stick with the May 4 release. On March 31, Jeff Wells was told by Jill Jones, Summit's senior VP of international marketing and publicity, that Icon has lost the right to distribute The Tree of Life in the UK, due to defaulting on its agreement, with the matter pending arbitration at a tribunal in Los Angeles. On June 9, it was announced that The Tree of Life would be released in the UK on July 8, 2011, after Fox Searchlight Pictures picked up the UK rights from Icon. =Home media= The Tree of Life was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United States and Canada on October 11, 2011; on January 24, 2012, there was a separate release of the DVD. During the Cannes Film Festival in 2011, Peter Becker, president of the home media company The Criterion Collection, and Fox Searchlight discussed a potential Criterion home video release that would include a longer alternate version of The Tree of Life which Malick would like to create. In an unprecedented move, Criterion decided to finance the alternate version for its eventual inclusion on both Blu-ray and DVD. In creating the alternate version, the original negatives' palettes were located for Malick to use, the entire film scanned in 4K resolution, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki brought in to help grade the footage, and a full sound mix created for the additional material, with Malick even dedicating \\"the better part of a year\\" to this project. Becker stated that the company has \\"never undertaken anything this extensive or this challenging, or anything that has taken this long to achieve or required so much effort on the part of pretty much every post-production craft. The only thing we didn’t do is go shoot new material\\". Malick was careful to note that the extended cut of the film is an alternative version, not the definitive one. In an interview with Indiewire, Criterion technical director Lee Kline said: > Unlike with [The New World], [the version of The Tree of Life] that > premiered in 2011 at Cannes [was] definitely the definitive version of the > film he wanted to make. What’s interesting talking to Terry about this [new > version of Tree of Life], I think he still doesn’t want people to think this > is a better version. This is another version. The extended version runs to 188 minutes; in addition to entirely new footage with new characters and scenes, it also extends existing scenes and features minor changes to the film's score, musical arrangements, and color grading. The extended cut was released on September 11, 2018, along with a new 4K digital restoration of the original version. Both editions also include the film's trailer, the making-of documentary Exploring \\"The Tree of Life\\", a 2011 interview with composer Alexandre Desplat, new interviews with actress Jessica Chastain, visual-effects supervisor Dan Glass, and music critic Alex Ross, and a 2011 video essay by Matt Zoller Seitz, as well as a booklet containing essays by film critics Kent Jones and Roger Ebert. The cover used for both editions is designed by Neil Kellerhouse. =Soundtrack= The Tree of Life Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat was released in 2011 by Lakeshore Records. \\"The Tree of Life\\" features selections and snippets from more than 30 individual pieces -- including works by Brahms, Mahler, Bach, Górecki and Holst. They are all woven together seamlessly with the help of some original music by Alexandre Desplat.https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/07/tree-of-life- terrence-malick.html Reception =Critical response= Brad Pitt promoting the film at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. Early reviews for The Tree of Life were polarized. After being met with both boos\\"Movie Starring Pitt, Penn Booed at Cannes\\", Evann Gastaldo. Newser. May 16, 2011. Retrieved September 10, 2011 and applause at its premiere at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, the film received mixed early reviews. It went on to be awarded the Palme d'Or. Two of its producers, Bill Pohlad and Sarah Green, accepted the prize on behalf of the reclusive Malick. The Tree of Life is the first American film to win the Palme d'Or since Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004. The head of the jury, Robert De Niro, said it was difficult to choose a winner, but The Tree of Life \\"ultimately fit the bill\\". De Niro explained, \\"It had the size, the importance, the intention, whatever you want to call it, that seemed to fit the prize.\\" The Tree of Life has since garnered critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 285 reviews, with an average rating of 8.15/10. The site's critics consensus reads \\"Terrence Malick's singularly deliberate style may prove unrewarding for some, but for patient viewers, Tree of Life is an emotional as well as visual treat.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 85 based on 50 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars of four and wrote: The following year, Ebert gave The Tree of Life one of his 10 votes in Sight & Sounds 2012 critics' poll of the world's greatest films. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said a \\"seraphic strain\\" in Malick's work \\"hits a solipsistic high\\" in The Tree of Life. \\"While the result will sound to some like a prayer, others may find it increasingly lonely and locked, and may themselves pray for Ben Hecht or Billy Wilder to rise from the dead and attack Malick’s script with a quiver of poisonous wisecracks.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five stars and lauded it as an \\"unashamedly epic reflection on love and loss\\" and a \\"mad and magnificent film.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter states \\"Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, including this one, could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place in the grand scheme of things that releases waves of insights amidst its narrative imprecisions.\\" Justin Chang of Variety states the film \\"represents something extraordinary\\" and \\"is in many ways his simplest yet most challenging work, a transfixing odyssey through time and memory that melds a young boy's 1950s upbringing with a magisterial rumination on the Earth's origins.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone states \\"Shot with a poet's eye, Malick's film is a groundbreaker, a personal vision that dares to reach for the stars.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film much praise and stated, \\"The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming, but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality\\". Total Film gave the film a five-star review (denoting 'outstanding'): \\"The Tree of Life is beautiful. Ridiculously, rapturously beautiful. You could press 'pause' at any second and hang the frame on your wall.\\" Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011. Some religious reviewers welcomed the spiritual themes of the film. For instance, Catholic author and now auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles Fr. Robert Barron, reviewing The Tree of Life for a Chicago Tribune blog, noted that \\"in the play of good and evil, in the tension between nature and grace, God is up to something beautiful, though we are unable to grasp it totally...“Tree of Life” is communicating this same difficult but vital lesson.\\" Rabbi David Wolpe says \\"that Terrence Malick's new film \\"Tree of Life\\" opens with a quotation from Job. That quotation holds the key to the film and in some sense, the key to our attitude toward life.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Sukhdev Sandhu, chief film critic of The Daily Telegraph describes the movie as \\"self-absorbed,\\" and \\"achingly slow, almost buckling under the weight of its swoony poetry.\\" Likewise, Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline praised the technical aspects of the film, such as the \\"gorgeous photography\\", but nonetheless criticized it as \\"a gargantuan work of pretension and cleverly concealed self-absorption.\\" Lee Marshall of Screen Daily referred to the film as \\"a cinematic credo about spiritual transcendence which, while often shot through with poetic yearning, preaches too directly to its audience.\\" Filmmaker David Lynch said that, while he liked Malick's previous works, The Tree of Life \\"was not his cup of tea\\". In 2016, John Patterson of The Guardian complained of the meager impression that the film left on him, opining that \\"much of it simply evaporates before your eyes.\\" Sean Penn has said, \\"The screenplay is the most magnificent one that I've ever read but I couldn't find that same emotion on screen. ... A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact.\\"Sean Penn on The Tree of Life: 'Terry never managed to explain it clearly', The Guardian He further clarified his reservations about the film by adding, \\"But it's a film I recommend, as long as you go in without any preconceived ideas. It's up to each person to find their own personal, emotional or spiritual connection to it. Those that do generally emerge very moved.\\"Penn on Malick, part deux, InContention =Top ten lists= The film appeared on over 70 critics' year-end top ten lists, including 15 first-place rankings. The Tree of Life was voted best film of 2011 in the annual Sight & Sound critic poll, earning one and a half times as many votes as runner up A Separation. The film also topped the critics poll of best released film of 2011 by Film Comment, and the IndieWire annual critics survey for 2011, as well as The Village Voice/LA Weekly Film Poll 2011. In France, Cahiers du cinéma placed it second on its 2011 top ten list, tying it with The Strange Case of Angelica. Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named The Tree of Life the third-best film of 2011, writing that \\"it may be the best thing [Malick's] ever done.\\" In 2012, 16 critics, including Roger Ebert, included it as one of their 10 votes for Sight & Sound; this placed it at #102 in the final list (making it the fourth film on the list which had been released since the year 2000, behind Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love, Edward Yang's Yi Yi, and David Lynch's Mulholland Drive). The film also received five votes in the directors' poll (placing it at #132). In 2015, Bradshaw named the film one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by The Guardian. In 2019, The Guardian ranked The Tree of Life 28th in its 100 best films of the 21st century list. The Tree of Life ranked seventh on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)'s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century in August 2016. The list was compiled by polling 177 film critics from around the world. In December 2019, The Tree of Life topped The Associated Press' list of the best films of the 2010s. In March 2020, America (magazine) put the film on its The Top 25 Films from the Last 25 Years. =Accolades= The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, Academy Award for Best Director, and Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the 84th Academy Awards The film won the 2011 FIPRESCI (International Federation of Film Critics) Big Prize for the Best Film Of the Year.

History Reed was born in Pelham, Georgia, and moved to the state of Florida in 1957. She attended National-Louis University, where she received a degree in behavioral science. Following graduation, she owned a small sandwich shop in Ybor City during the 1980s. She then started working for Remington College, where she was an assistant to the president, the director of financial aid and financial assistance, and then the director of career services. Additionally, she served as the President of the Lucy-Dell Civic Association and the Associate Director of the North Tampa Chamber of Commerce. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Arthenia Joyner opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Reed ran to succeed her in the 59th District, which stretched from University to Gibsonton and included much of Tampa in Hillsborough County. In the Democratic primary, she faced Warren Dawson and Hakim Aquil, and she emerged narrowly victorious, winning 47% of the vote and defeating Dawson by a little more than 300 votes. In the general election, she faced Willis \\"K.C.\\" Bowick, the Republican nominee. Reed campaigned on educational reforms, including closing the achievement gap in students of different races, smaller classrooms, and providing new teachers with mentors. Owing to the district's strong partisan lean, Reed defeated Bowick in a landslide, winning 84% of the vote. In 2008, Dawson, whom she defeated in the primary two years prior, challenged her again, but once again, Reed emerged victorious, defeating Dawson with 70% of the vote. She won the general election entirely uncontested, and in 2010, she was re-elected without opposition at all. In 2012, following the reconfiguration of legislative districts, Reed was moved to the 61st District, which included most of the territory that she had previously represented. She was opposed in the Democratic primary by Tatiana Denson, who advocated for \\"generational change\\" in the election. Ultimately, Reed easily turned away Denson's challenge, winning the renomination of her party with 81% of the vote. She was unopposed in the general election, and won her final term in the legislature entirely uncontested.

The parish is made up of the medieval parish of Banagher and parts of the ancient parish of Boveva and the townland of Tireighter and Park, once in the parish of Cumber.The Parish at banagherparish.com (accessed 3 March 2008) Banagher has many ancient monuments, including churches, holy wells, standing stones and chambered graves. Geography Banagher lies in the western foothills of the Sperrin Mountains, between the rivers Roe and Faughan. The landscape is mostly rugged, with glens and narrow valleys rising into the highlands. Banagher Glen is a good example of the area's terrain and forms an important conservation area, preserving one of the few surviving examples of old-growth deciduous woodland in Ireland. The Glen has a trail which climbs through the woods to Altnaheglish Dam and Reservoir, which supplies water to Derry. The path up to the dam from the valley floor climbs through deciduous woodland and higher coniferous woodland to moor and heathland. History It is clear from the Annals of Ulster that there was a church at Banagher in 1121. In that year it is recorded that Giolla Easpaig Eoghain O hAindiaraidh (), king of Keenaght, was killed by kinsmen in the Banagher cemetery. His name means 'servant of Bishop Eoghan', apparently a reference to St Eugene, Bishop of Ardstraw.Medieval People and Events online at banagherparish.com (accessed 4 March 2008) On a sandy ridge by the River Owenreagh are the ruins of the old church and of a small square building sometimes called 'the abbey', with sharply pointed gables which once supported a stone roof. The church had a nave and chancel, but little remains of it. In the nearby cemetery is an ancient cross and a monument to St Muriedhach O'Heney, who is said to have founded the church and to have been abbot of the building next to it, and on one side of this is an effigy of him.from Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, 1837: County Londonderry, Ireland : Civil Parishes : Banagher , online at from-ireland.net (accessed 3 March 2008) However, St Muriedhach O'Heney appears in no calendar of saints. According to local legend, St Muriedhach was led to the site of his church by a stag which carried his book on its antlers, acting as a movable lectern.Colton, John, Acts of Archbishop Colton in His Metropolitan Visitation in the Diocese of Derry, AD MCCCXCVII, with a Rental of the See Estates at that Time (Dublin, Irish Archaeological Society, 1850), pages 107-108 online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 4 March 2008) Earl-Bishop, who paid for a Banagher church spire Beside the remains of the ancient church is the hole from which sand called 'Banagher sand' is drawn, long believed to give good luck to race horses when thrown over them.The Old Church of Banagher, County of Londonderry online at libraryireland.com (accessed 4 March 2008) There were also ruins of ancient churches at Straid and Templemoile, and the parish had a vitrified fort, on which by tradition fires were lit at Midsummer. Near the parish church is a large man-made cave. At the time of the Plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century, some townships of Banagher, including Ballyhanedin, were granted by the Crown to the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers of the City of London, and others to the Worshipful Company of Skinners. Banagher became a distinct Presbyterian congregation about 1753, and its first minister was John Law who was ordained in 1756.Banagher Presbyterian online at historyfromheadstones.com (accessed 3 March 2008) The 18th century Church of Ireland church at Banagher, with a tower and octagonal spire, is on a rise in the ground and was built in 1782. The spire was paid for by Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, then Bishop of Derry, who was responsible for the construction of the famous Mussenden Temple. A Presbyterian meeting house at Ballyhanedin, in the Classical Greek style, was built by the Fishmongers' Company. As early as 1837 there were parish schools for boys and girls at Ballagh, at Tyrglassen (supported by the Fishmongers Company) and at Fincarn. Church of Ireland records exist for the parish of Banagher from 1821 for baptisms, 1827 for marriages, and 1837 for burials.Ryan, James G., Irish Records: Sources for Family and Local History (Ancestry Publishing Ireland, 1997) p. 170 Griffith's valuation of Ireland, completed in 1864, shows tenements in Aughlish, Ballyhanedin, Carnanbane, Coolnamonan, Derrychrier, Drumcovit, Feeny, Fincarn, Finglen, Gallany, Killunaght, Knockan, Magheramore, Rallagh, Tamnyagan, Teeavan, Templemoyle, Tirglassan, and Umrycam.Griffith's valuation of Ireland for Banagher (accessed 13 Feb 2013) Ten other townlands or streets of Banagher are listed at ireland.com: Ballydonegan, Dreen, Eden, Glenedra, Kilcreen, Loughtilube, Moneyhoghan, Straid, Tamnagh and Terrydreen.Streets and Townlands of Banagher, Derry at Irish Ancestors, online at ireland.com (accessed 4 March 2008) Industry The main industries are drylining, agriculture and sand quarrying, and local pastimes include fishing and hill walking.

Hoosier Gym in a 2017 game between Lighthouse Christian and South Ripley. Note the absence of a center time line. The court is not regulation length. Teams cross the forward time line and can then back up to the rear time line. The Hoosier Gym is a basketball gymnasium, museum, and community center located in Knightstown, Indiana. It is famous for being a filming location for the 1986 basketball movie Hoosiers, starring Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper. The gym was the home court of the movie's Hickory Huskers. The facility has kept the same look as it did when the movie was filmed in 1985. The gym attracts 80,000 tourists to the town per year.  History  = Initial construction = In 1920, the Knightstown Community School had no gymnasium. Basketball games were held in Bell's Hall above Jolly's Drugstore and in the basement gym of the Presbyterian Church. In February 1921, a half- dozen Knightstown businessmen met to discuss the fact that Knightstown was lagging behind other towns in the development of children's athletic education. After much debate, a plan to build a \\"gymnasium and community house\\" was developed and approved. To help fund the new gym, they raised more than $14,400 in donations from more than 250 citizens and several local businesses. Finally, on December 1, 1921, construction of the gym was completed. At long and wide, the new gym was big enough to accommodate not only basketball games and spectators (with bleacher seating around the sides and end of the playing floor), but also many civic and community-oriented events. Upon completion of the new construction, it became evident that additional funds would be needed for maintenance and custodial services, including heat and lighting. It wasn't long before arrangements were made for several professional basketball teams to play on the new floor, including the EmRoes, Michigan Rails, and Baltimore Orioles (basketball). The town even persuaded players from various colleges to compete against local teams. Within four years, the school board made the final payment on the gymnasium and took full control of the building. = Additional construction = As Knightstown grew, so did the demands for the gym. In 1936, the school board used local and federal Works Progress Administration funds to make major improvements. The project included an exterior facelift with a new front entrance and lobby, and the creation of basement dressing rooms. In 1952, the gym was expanded again. In order to accommodate the school's growing art, music, and science departments, three classrooms, a kitchen, and restrooms were added on the east end of the building. = Closure = By 1966, the gym had become obsolete with the building of a new high school and gym. The Panthers of Knightstown played their last official regular-season basketball game at the gym that February. So after 45 years of serving the community and providing a place for its young people to grow and develop, the gym was closed. For the next 19 years, the old gym saw little use. = Hoosiers Film location = Interior of the gym in 2017. Note the gym remains decorated in the same manner as during the 1986 film. The \\"Go Hickory\\" banner can be seen on the wall. To the left of that is the team photo from the film. In 1985, interest in the gym increased when a film crew descended upon Knightstown, looking for a place to film Hoosiers. The movie told the story of the unique phenomenon known as Hoosier Hysteria — Indiana’s obsession with basketball. The gym provided the perfect setting. About one third of the film was filmed in the gym. As a result of the success of this film, the old Knightstown gymnasium came to be known as the Hoosier Gym.  Reopening  By 1988, the gym faced possible demolition as the 112-year-old school next door, then serving as an elementary school, was replaced by a new school north of town. The old school became an apartment building. Two groups, Historic Knightstown and Historic Landmarks of Indiana, stepped forward to help preserve the gym. Now it hosts 80 high school basketball games a year. Additionally, each year the gym holds the Hoosiers Reunion All-Star Classic, where Indiana's best high school athletes play against each other, with the teams named \\"Hickory\\" and \\"Terhune,\\" as in the movie.

The atmospheric haze lowers the temperature in the lower atmosphere, while methane raises the temperature at the surface. Cryovolcanoes erupt methane into the atmosphere, which then rains down onto the surface, forming lakes. The climate of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is similar in many respects to that of Earth, despite having a far lower surface temperature. Its thick atmosphere, methane rain, and possible cryovolcanism create an analogue, though with different materials, to the climatic changes undergone by Earth during its far shorter year. Temperature Titan receives just about 1% of the amount of sunlight Earth does. The average surface temperature is about 90.6 K (-182.55°C, or -296.59°F).D. E. Jennings et al. (2016). Astrophysical Journal Letters, 816, L17, http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/2041-8205/816/1/L17. see: https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia20020/titan-temperature-lag-maps- animation.) At this temperature water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure, so the atmosphere is nearly free of water vapor. However the methane in the atmosphere causes a substantial greenhouse effect which keeps the surface of Titan at a much higher temperature than what would otherwise be the thermal equilibrium. Haze in Titan's atmosphere contributes to an anti-greenhouse effect by reflecting sunlight back into space, making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere. This partially compensates for the greenhouse warming, and keeps the surface somewhat cooler than would otherwise be expected from the greenhouse effect alone. According to McKay et al., \\"the anti-greenhouse effect on Titan reduces the surface temperature by 9 K whereas the greenhouse effect increases it by 21 K. The net effect is that the surface temperature (94 K) is 12 K warmer than the effective temperature 82 K. [i.e., the equilibrium that would be reached in the absence of any atmosphere]\\" Seasons Titan's orbital tilt with respect to the sun is very close to Saturn's axial tilt (about 27°), and its axial tilt with respect to its orbit is zero. This means that the direction of incoming sunlight is driven almost entirely by Titan's day-night cycle and Saturn's year cycle. The day cycle on Titan lasts 15.9 Earth days, which is how long it takes Titan to orbit Saturn. Titan is tidally locked, so the same part of Titan always faces Saturn, and there is no separate \\"month\\" cycle. Seasonal change is driven by Saturn's year: it takes Saturn about 29.5 Earth years to orbit the sun, exposing different amounts of sunlight to Titan's northern and southern hemispheres during different parts of the Saturnian year. Seasonal weather changes include larger hydrocarbon lakes in the northern hemisphere during the winter, decreased haze around the equinoxes due to changing atmospheric circulation, and associated ice clouds in the South Polar regions. The last equinox occurred on August 11, 2009; this was the spring equinox for the northern hemisphere, meaning the southern hemisphere is getting less sunlight and moving into winter. Surface winds are normally low (<1 meter per second). Recent computer simulations indicate that the huge dunes of soot like material raining down from the atmosphere in the equatorial regions may instead be shaped by rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. The storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface. In late 2010, the equivalent of early Spring in Titan's northern hemisphere, a series of methane storms were observed in Titan's equatorial desert regions. Due to the eccentricity of Saturn's orbit, Titan is about 12% closer to the sun during the southern hemisphere summer, making southern summers shorter but hotter than northern summers. This asymmetry may contribute to topological differences between the hemispheres - the northern hemisphere has many more hydrocarbon lakes. Titan's lakes are largely placid, with few waves or ripples; however, Cassini has found evidence of increasing turbulence during the northern hemisphere summer, suggesting that surface winds may strengthen during certain times of the Titanian year. Waves and ripples have also been seen by Cassini. Methane rain and lakes The findings of the Huygens probe indicate that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane and other organic compounds onto the moon's surface. In October 2007, observers noted an increase in apparent opacity in the clouds above the equatorial Xanadu region, suggestive of \\"methane drizzle\\", though this was not direct evidence for rain. However, subsequent images of lakes in Titan's southern hemisphere taken over one year show that they are enlarged and filled by seasonal hydrocarbon rainfall. It is possible that areas of Titan's surface may be coated in a layer of tholins, but this has not been confirmed. The presence of rain indicates that Titan may be the only Solar System body besides Earth upon which rainbows could form. However, given the extreme opacity of the atmosphere to visible light, the vast majority of any rainbows would be visible only in the infrared. The number of methane lakes visible near Titan's south pole is decidedly smaller than the number observed near the north pole. As the south pole is currently in summer and the north pole in winter, an emerging hypothesis is that methane rains onto the poles in winter and evaporates in summer. According to a paper by Tetsuya Tokano of the University of Cologne, cyclones driven by this evaporation and involving rain as well as gale-force winds of up to 20 m/s (45 mph) are expected to form over the large northern seas (Kraken Mare, Ligeia Mare, Punga Mare) only in the northern summer, lasting up to ten days. To date no waves have been observed on any of Titan's lakes; however, calculations suggest that, as the northern hemisphere, where most of the lakes reside, enters the long Titanean summer, wind speeds might increase to 3 km/h, levels sufficient to produce waves. Circulation A rotating vortex above Titan's south pole Simulations of global wind patterns based on wind speed data taken by Huygens during its descent have suggested that Titan's atmosphere circulates in a single enormous Hadley cell. Warm gas rises in Titan's southern hemisphere—which was experiencing summer during Huygens descent—and sinks in the northern hemisphere, resulting in high-altitude gas flow from south to north and low-altitude gas flow from north to south. Such a large Hadley cell is only possible on a slowly rotating world such as Titan. The pole-to-pole wind circulation cell appears to be centered on the stratosphere; simulations suggest it ought to change every twelve years, with a three-year transition period, over the course of Titan's year (30 terrestrial years). This cell creates a global band of low pressure—what is in effect a variation of Earth's Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Unlike on Earth, however, where the oceans confine the ITCZ to the tropics, on Titan, the zone wanders from one pole to the other, taking methane rainclouds with it. This means that Titan, despite its frigid temperatures, can be said to have a tropical climate. In June 2012, Cassini imaged a rotating polar vortex on Titan's southern pole, which the imaging team believe is related to a \\"polar hood\\" - an area of dense, high altitude haze seen over the northern pole since the probe's arrival in 2004. As the hemispheres are now switching seasons since the 2009 equinox, with the southern pole entering winter and the north entering summer, it is hypothesised that this vortex could mark the formation of a new, southern polar hood. Clouds Titan - North pole - cloud system imaged in false color. text-top Titan's clouds, probably composed of methane, ethane, or other simple organics, are scattered and variable, punctuating the overall haze. In September 2006, Cassini imaged a large cloud at a height of 40 km over Titan's north pole. Although methane is known to condense in Titan's atmosphere, the cloud was more likely to be ethane, as the detected size of the particles was only 1–3 micrometers and ethane can also freeze at these altitudes. In December, Cassini again observed cloud cover and detected methane, ethane and other organics. The cloud was over 2400 km in diameter and was still visible during a following flyby a month later. One hypothesis is that it is currently raining (or, if cool enough, snowing) on the north pole; the downdrafts at high northern latitudes are strong enough to drive organic particles towards the surface. These were the strongest evidence yet for the long-hypothesized \\"methanological\\" cycle (analogous to Earth's hydrological cycle) on Titan. Clouds have also been found over the south polar region. While typically covering 1% of Titan's disk, outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the Titanean summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only post–summer solstice but also at mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. There had been summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs the moon's motion, tilted the northern hemisphere towards the Sun. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole. Titan methane clouds (animated; July 2014). Research models that match well with observations suggest that clouds on Titan cluster at preferred coordinates and that cloud cover varies by distance from the surface on different parts of the satellite. In the polar regions (above 60 degrees latitude), widespread and permanent ethane clouds appear in and above the troposphere; at lower latitudes, mainly methane clouds are found between 15 and 18 km, and are more sporadic and localized. In the summer hemisphere, frequent, thick but sporadic methane clouds seem to cluster around 40°. Ground-based observations also reveal seasonal variations in cloud cover. Over the course of Saturn's 30-year orbit, Titan's cloud systems appear to manifest for 25 years, and then fade for four to five years before reappearing again. Cassini has also detected high-altitude, white, cirrus-type clouds in Titan's upper atmosphere, likely formed of methane. Although no evidence of lightning activity has yet been observed on Titan, computer models suggest that clouds in the moon's lower troposphere can accumulate enough charge to generate lightning from an altitude of roughly 20 km. The presence of lightning in Titan's atmosphere would favour the production of organic materials. Cassini did not detect any significant signal of lightning in Titan's atmosphere though lightning could still be present if it was too weak to be detected. Recent computer simulations have shown that under certain circumstances streamer discharges, the early stages of lightning discharges, may be formable on Titan.

It is a \\"not-for- profit\\" membership association representing organisations from across the public, private and voluntary sectors. Cifas states its mission is ‘to detect, deter and prevent fraud in society by harnessing technology and working in partnership’. Cifas operates two core fraud prevention databases that are claimed to be the largest in the UK: the National Fraud Database and the Internal Fraud Database. Its systems are also used by banks and building societies to access Home Office immigration data through a specialist portal. Data from Cifas' members reveals that instances of identity fraud in the UK are at record levels in the UK, particularly among people aged under 30. Cifas data also highlights the growing issue of \\"money mules\\" – people who allow their bank accounts to be used to launder money.  History  Cifas was established in 1988 by the Consumer Credit Trade Association (CCTA) under the acronym CIFAS: Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System, although the company no longer operates under this acronym as the scope of its services has broadened. It was developed in association with the Office of Fair Trading, as well as the Information Commissioner's Office, who continue to this day to take an active interest in the development of Cifas. Cifas is today run by a board of directors, that includes both independent directors who are not directly involved in the day-to-day running of the organisation, and the Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer, who are. From 1988 to 2016 the majority of the directors were elected by participating organisations. They now participate in the governance of the organisation through an \\"Advisory Board\\".  Fraud Databases  Cifas' National Fraud Database allows participating organisations to exchange details of applications for products or services which are considered to be fraudulent, inconsistent or suspicious ( see https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn ); exchange information about accounts and services which are being misused; and information about insurance and other claims that are considered to be fraudulent, inconsistent or suspicious. Organisations can also exchange information about innocent victims of fraud to protect them from further fraud. The Internal Fraud Database allows participating organisations to exchange details of cases where an applicant or member of staff has acted fraudulently. Under the Data Protection Act, an individual has the right to make a Subject Access Request to Cifas, who will, in accordance with the Act and its exemptions, disclose data held on the individual where the law permits it. Cifas is not a Credit Reference Agency but is the Data Controller for Cifas data and responsible for its accuracy.  Complaints  All warnings used to be examined by specialist fraud staff in participating organisations but automated systems may now be used to refuse a product or service without any investigation of a warning. Cifas says: \\"The ability to make automated decisions allows members to immediately decline facilities to subjects who are deemed an immediate fraud risk. This is another massive step forward in utilising the data from Cifas, freeing up resource from reviewing referrals that have already been deemed a high fraud risk.\\" (https://www.cifas.org.uk/insight/fraud-risk-focus-blog/how-updated- principles-using-cifas-national-fraud-database-help-its-members) Consumers who are disadvantaged by this change in practice, may complain to the Information Commissioner and seek financial compensation from both Cifas and the responsible organisations who supplied and used the information.

Cifas was named as the sole provider of Home Office Immigration Data and launched the Cifas Immigration Portal (CIP) in December 2014. All current account-providing banks and building societies in the UK are required to use the CIP to access the Home Office data on disqualified persons. The data was implicated in the \\"Windrush Scandal\\".

Protective Registration acts as a warning the organisation should (but they are not forced to) carry out additional checks to verify the identity of the applicant or customer. They may just refuse the product or service instead as they consider the fraud risk to be too high. Cifas used to operate a Protecting the Vulnerable scheme that helped local authorities protect individuals subject to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in their care.

It can also be leveraged in other areas of business such as inventory management, contract management, complex sourcing, supplier management, budgeting, planning, and product development. There are three core areas of spend analysis - visibility, analysis, and process. By leveraging all three, companies can generate answers to the crucial questions affecting their spending, including: * What am I really spending? * With whom am I spending it? * Am I getting what was promised for that spend? Spend Analysis is often viewed as part of a larger domain known as Spend Management which incorporates spend analysis, commodity management, industry spend benchmarking, and strategic sourcing. Companies perform a spend analysis for several reasons. The core business driver for most organizations is profitability. In addition to improving compliance and reducing cycle times, performing detailed spend analysis helps companies find new areas of savings that previously went untapped, and hold on to past areas of savings that they have already negotiated. Automated spend analysis software can be a valuable tool for chief procurement officers (CPOs) at large, global, diversified enterprises, and a useful tool for many others.A. Bartels, T. Pohlmann, H. Lo and C. Lee, Market Overview 2008: Automated Spend Analysis, Forrester Research, 2008 The resulting spend visibility helps CPOs and CFOs gain insight into what their company buys and from whom, and it helps them realize savings promised by past sourcing efforts.

In its organisation, it is very similar to British Traditional Wicca groups such as Gardnerian Wicca, however, it does not trace its initiatory line to one of the old English covens. The name \\"Georgian\\" refers to its founder, George Patterson, who founded the tradition in 1970 in the United States. History The Georgian Tradition was founded in 1970 by George Eliott (Pat) Patterson III, when he began teaching his first students, two women called Zanoni Silverknife (Jillaine Callison, 1946-2020) and Tanith (Linda Guinn, 1947-2015). It began as a small coven in Patterson’s home, in Bakersfield, California. Patterson claimed to have received early teachings from members of a Celtic Coven in Boston. He told his early initiates when World War II began, he enlisted in the Armed Forces and served for four years. On his return to Boston, he found family members had destroyed his Book and ritual items. He could not find the family he'd studied with. Despite research into this history, there is no independent evidence any such coven existed. At other times, he told students and initiates that he had been initiated into either the Alexandrian or Gardnerian Tradition, and at one point also claimed to have been initiated into the Craft by his father. Investigation of the claims of initiation into either the Alexandrian or Gardnerian Traditions have demonstrated no verification in the records of either of those traditions; initiation by his father can neither be proved nor disproved. Soon after forming the group, Patterson applied to the State of California for legal status as an incorporated church and through the Universal Life Church had a charter (1971) and Ministerial credentials for himself and Silverknife. Patterson gathered information, lessons and lore from many helpful sources. These included Doris and Sylvester Stuart of England, Lady Gwen Thompson of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.E.C.T.W.), and others. The Georgian Tradition is based on Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca practices, incorporating Etruscan lore from Leland, using those rites and rituals shared by the Sylvestrians and N.E.C.T.W. as well as material from New York Covens of Traditionalist Witches (N.Y.C.T.W); Lord Hermes (Edmund Buczynski) and Lady Siobhan (Order of the Silver Wheel) were most helpful. Many of the rituals are similar to those published in various books on what is sometimes called \\"British Traditional Wicca\\" (BTW), such as Janet and Stewart Farrar's Eight Sabbats for Witches and The Witches' Way, as well as the privately distributed version of what was later published as Ed Fitch's Grimoire of the Shadows. Georgian Wicca is therefore similar to Alexandrian and Gardnerian Wiccan practice, in that it is an initiatory line and oath-bound. Georgian Wicca, however, is not a recognized member of the BTW, as it lacks an important requirement - initiatory lineage back to one of the BTW covens in England. Therefore, it is considered BTW-derived.  Newsletter days  Beginning in 1976, Patterson edited the \\"Georgian Newsletter\\", a chatty, informal correspondence that helped to build the community of Georgians and link them with one another. Following his death in 1984, the newsletter continued for a few years, and subsequently ceased publication. The newsletter contained bits of gossip, \\"Helpful Hints\\", book reviews, and the ever popular feature \\"Being a Witch is ... \\" Following a lengthy hiatus, the Georgian Newsletter was revived as a free publication in 2007 by members of the tradition, a current archive (as of May 2013) exists at The Georgian Wicca Tradition Newsletter.  Present day  Georgians are now worldwide and growing; many are in the Armed Forces, carrying the Tradition with them. Recently, there has been an upsurge in those interested in reconnecting with or learning about the Georgian Tradition. At present, there are known Georgian Covens in British Columbia, California, Florida, Oregon, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Washington, Utah, and Oklahoma. There is also a current effort being made to reconnect members of the Tradition.  Fictional depictions  In S. M. Stirling's Emberverse series, the Singing Moon Coven, which forms the basis of the Wiccan Clan MacKenzie, is described as: > an eclectic Georgian group who favor Celtic symbolism A number of aspects of Georgian Wiccan derived practice are portrayed in the series.

He is a Sergeant in the British Special Air Service (SAS), and appears in four of Ryan's best-selling works.  Fictional character history  Geordie Sharp (born George Sharp) had an unhappy childhood which prompted him to join the British Army at the age of 16. When he eventually was badged a member of 22 Regiment Special Air Service, he felt as if his life had actually been worth living, through the best and worst of the times. But this begins to change when Sharp returns from the Gulf War, severely wounded after an accident deep in Iraqi-held territory which resulted in his brief internment as a prisoner of war. Sharp begins to suffer from marriage problems when he is dispatched to Northern Ireland to train with the SAS, but the problem becomes personal when his estranged wife is killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army and, nearly maddened with sorrow and rage, Geordie goes on a personal vendetta to hunt down the terrorists responsible, putting at risk his entire military career in the process. He soon finds himself thrown into danger again when the PIRA attempts revenge by forcing Sharp to assassinate the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by threatening to murder his only son, Timothy Sharp. A few years after this incident, Sharp is reassigned to Moscow, supposedly to train a Spetnaz unit, although Sharp is secretly expected to plant nuclear explosives under The Kremlin while using the military as his cover. However, he goes on to compromise the entire operation by launching an unauthorized mission against the Chechen Mafia, which leave several Russian gangsters dead. Moscow's underworld is swift to retaliate, kidnapping two of Sharp's SAS contacts and getting control of the nuclear device. Although Geordie is quick to attempt a remedy of the situation before it spins out of control and causes a major international crisis, he finds himself reassigned again at the operation's end, this time to Southern Africa. Sharp's new post is Kamanga, a former British colony now prone to brutal tribal massacres. The corrupt dictatorship government is led by General Bakunda, a Kaswiri member of the majority northern tribe in Kamanga. The majority southern tribe, the Afundis, wages a brutal guerrilla war against the regime under the direction of their unlikely leader: Gus Muende, Bakunda's former adopted son and an avowed Marxist of mixed European-African ancestry. Geordie and seven other UK military operatives are asked to train one of Bakunda's anti-Afundi death squads, a special forces militia known as the Alpha Commando. Again, things go wrong on the operation's first week, when a member of the team driving a truck strikes and kills a local village boy. The witch doctor in the region puts a curse on Sharp if he refuses to leave Kamanga immediately: Ten white people shall die, and their blood will be on Geordie's head. In the days that follow, the curse comes horribly true: Two South Africans traveling with a German Namibian woman are killed in a plane crash which Sharp witnesses; the woman herself is saved but promptly reveals she is in the Afundis' employ and betrays Sharp to the rebels. One by one, several members of Sharp's team die: The first trampled by an elephant, a second cannibalized by Gus Muende, and a third shot dead during a daring escape attempt. The next three victims are local Afrikaner mercenaries in the employ of a rogue private military corporation: The first is executed by the Alpha Commando, the second is killed trying to help Sharp escape a rebel camp, and the third is thrown out of a helicopter by Geordie himself. The Alpha Commando promptly turn against Sharp and declare him and his team wanted criminals in Kamanga, due to the greed of a major who believes they are in possession of a diamond stolen from a government mine. It is eventually revealed that this diamond in question was hidden in the plane piloted by the Namibian woman and her companions when it crashed. She subsequently recovers it with Muende's help; the two, facing only inevitable defeat against Bakunda's army as it rapidly intensifies the fighting, decide to go into exile in Central America, dividing the proceeds of the diamond's sale. However, a vengeful Geordie tracks them down, and both are shot dead by a Kamangan soldier. This brings the figure of dead whites since the witch doctor's curse up to nine. While later attempting to stop the rebels from getting their hands on an old stockpile of Soviet warheads, Sharp is exposed to a near-fatal dose of radiation. He eventually flees Kamanga and soon afterwards learns he may have contracted cancer. This earns Sharp a discharge from the army, and he retires to Northern Ireland to live with his child. However, even there the witch doctor's curse haunts him; his son notes that if Geordie dies from his radiation exposure, the prediction would come true: He would be the tenth white man down.

History  In 1984 Commodore signed a deal with Intel to second source manufacture the Intel 8088 CPU used in the IBM PC, along with a license to manufacture a computer based on the Dynalogic Hyperion. It is unknown whether any of these systems were produced or sold. In 1987 the first model released, the PC-10, sold for $559 without monitor ($ in ). They were sold alongside Commodore's Amiga and Commodore 64c/128 lines of home and graphics computers. The PC10 was comparable in the market to the Blue Chip PC, Leading Edge Model D and Tandy 1000 line of PC compatibles.  Models  The line consists of the following models: * PC-I (a.k.a. PC1): A small-form- factor low-end non-expandable system. It has a 4.77 MHz 8088 processor, combined Hercules/CGA graphics, and one 5.25-inch floppy disk drive. It came standard with 512 kB of RAM. * PC-5: A full-size PC/XT-clone with a standard monochrome text card and 512k of memory on the motherboard. It is expandable with up to five 8-bit ISA cards. * PC-10: A full AT-sized model with an 8088 and combined Hercules/CGA/Plantronics Colorplus graphics provided by an ATI Graphics Solution card. Two variations were produced: the PC10-1 with one floppy drive and 512 kB RAM and the PC10-2 with two floppy drives and 640 kB RAM. These systems can be upgraded with the 8087 FPU. * PC-20: A PC-10 with a 20 MB hard disk * Colt: A rebranded PC10-III * PC-30: A PC-AT compatible with a 12 MHz 80286 CPU and a 20MB hard disk. * PC-40: A 12 MHz PC-AT system with 1 MB of RAM, on-board VGA/EGA/CGA and Hercules video, and hard disk options from 20–80 MB. * PC-50: Based on the 386SX running at 16 MHz.

She was able to purchase the decorating division of the antique dealers Stair and Andrew of Bruton Street, Mayfair and established Sibyl Colefax Ltd in partnership with Peggy Ward, the Countess Munster. On her 'retirement' (following a family tragedy) Peggy Ward advised her to take on John Fowler (1906–1977) as her partner, which she did in April 1938. The advent of war cut short this partnership. During the Second World War, she organised a soup kitchen and continued to entertain. She often held small lunch parties at The Dorchester known as 'Ordinaries' after which the guest would receive a small bill.The Times, Tuesday, 26 September 1950; pg. 6; Issue 51806; col E Lady Colefax A Great London Hostess RAB In 1944 the business, managed by John Fowler, took a lease on 39 Brook Street, Mayfair where it remained until December 2016. Also in 1944 Sibyl Colefax sold the business to Nancy Tree (Nancy Lancaster as she became in 1948) for a sum in the order of £10000. She renamed the business Sibyl Colefax and John Fowler Ltd, the name continuing today as the decorating division of the Colefax Group Plc. Sibyl Colefax died at her home in Lord North Street, Westminster on 22 September 1950. Harold Nicolson penned an affectionate tribute that appeared shortly after in The Listener.

The Carthaginian army under Hannibal MagoA king of Carthage of the Magonid family, not the famous Hannibal of the Barcid family. besieged the Dorian Greek city of Akragas in retaliation for the Greek raids on Punic colonies in Sicily. The city managed to repel Carthaginian attacks until a relief army from Syracuse defeated part of the besieging Carthaginian army and lifted the siege of the city. During the siege, Hannibal and a large number of Carthaginian soldiers perished from the plague, and the survivors were in dire straits after the Greeks managed to cut their supply lines. The Carthaginians, now led by Himilco, a Magonid kinsman of Hannibal, managed to capture a Greek supply convoy of ships using the Carthaginian fleet, which forced the Greeks to face the threat of starvation in turn. This caused first the Sicilian Greek detachment, then most of the population of Akragas to leave the city, enabling Himilco to capture and sack the city. Background Carthage had stayed away from Sicilian affairs for almost seventy years following the defeat at Himera in 480 BC;Baker G.P., Hannibal, p. 17. during the intervening time Greek culture had started to penetrate the Elymian, Sikanian and Sicel cities in Sicily. The Greek tyrannies of Syracuse and Akragas, which were responsible for the victory at Himera, had fallen apart by 460 BC and the Greeks had to fend off the challenge of Ducetius in addition infighting among themselves. The inactivity of Carthage regarding Sicily changed in 411 when the Ionian Greek (former Elymian) city Segesta clashed with the Dorian Greek city Selinus and got the worst of the conflict. Segesta then appealed to Carthage for aid. This appeal came at a time when the mainland Greek cities were locked in the Peloponnesian War, and Syracuse, an ally of Sparta, was not focused on Sicily. The Syracusan fleet was operating in the Aegean Sea, and Syracuse was in conflict with Naxos and Leontini, two Ionian Greek cities sympathetic to another Ionic city, Athens, the enemy of Sparta. The Carthaginian Senate, after some debate, agreed to intervene on behalf of Segesta. Carthage raised an army and fleet for the expedition in 410 BC and dispatched the force to Sicily after diplomatic efforts for a compromise between Selinus and Segesta had failed. Hannibal Mago of Carthage led the expedition, took the city of Selinus by storm in 409 and then also destroyed the city of Himera.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp. 163-168. Syracuse and Akragas, the leading Greek cities in Sicily, did not confront Carthage at that time, and the Carthaginian army withdrew with the spoils of war after garrisoning their territory in Western Sicily. For three years, a lull fell on Sicily. No treaties had been signed between the Greeks and Carthaginians to signal a closure of hostilities. Prelude to Akragas While the governments of Syracuse and Akragas took only preventive measures, Hermocrates, an exiled general of Syracuse, sought to take a more aggressive stance on the issue of Carthaginian aggression, hoping that his actions would enable him to return to Syracuse and assume a political position. He hired 2,000 mercenaries (1,000 of them former citizens of Himera) and five ships and then set up a base in the ruins of Selinus, building a wall for security around the acropolis. His force ultimately swelled to 6,000 men, (many former citizens of Selinus had joined him) and Hermocrates started to raid Punic territories at his discretion. He first defeated the men of Motya, then ravaged their land. His next target was the territory of \\"Golden Shell\\", the land around Panormus. In 407 BC, the Greeks defeated the citizens of Panormus (killing 500 of them) and plundered at will, retiring to Selinus with their spoils. These activities gained Hermocrates fame and sympathy with Sicilian Greeks, but no recall from Syracuse. Hermocrates then collected the bones of the Greek dead left unburied at Himera and sent them over to Syracuse for burial, an act that further enhanced his reputation among the Greeks (and brought about the downfall of Diocles, the Syracusan leader defeated at Himera and who had actually left the bones unburied) but did not end his exile from Syracuse. The general finally tried to stage a coup in Syracuse, where he died in a street fight.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, pp. 144-146. Syracuse and Akragas did not neglect their defences during the activities of Hermocrates. Akragas, expecting to be the first target of any Carthaginian retaliation, set about expanding its army while Syracuse started to expand its fleet. The walls of both the cities were also kept in repair.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 147. =Greek preparations= Syracuse and Akragas took speedy action to prepare for the expected Punic response after the downfall of Hermocrates. Syracuse appealed to the cities of Magna Graecia and even Sparta for help, while a general named Daphnaeus was elected to lead the Syracusan war effort. An officer named Dionysius, who had been a cohort of the fallen Hermocrates, was also elected as part of the army command staff. The Greeks started gathering an army at Syracuse which included Greeks from Camarina, Gela, Messene, and Italy in addition to mercenaries, but Sparta was unable to send aid at this time. Akragas hired the Spartan general Dexippus with a band of 1,500 hoplites and some Campanian mercenaries (previously serving under Hannibal Mago at Himera) to augment their force of 10,000 troops.Kern, Paul B. Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 169. Syracuse posted a fleet of forty triremes at Eryx to watch for the movement of the Punic navy. =Carthage makes ready= The Carthaginian Senate had offered the command of the coming expedition to Hannibal Mago (the “Greek Hater”), who at first refused the position pleading advanced age. When his kinsman Himilco was appointed as his deputy, Hannibal set about making preparations in earnest.Diod. 13.80.1-2. Aside from Carthaginian citizens, troops were levied from Africa, Spain, and Italy, so an army of 120,000 men (probably exaggerated; around 60,000 is closer to the truthKern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 168.) and a fleet of 120 triremes and 1,000 transports were made ready by the Spring of 406 BC.Diod. 13.61.4-6, 13.84. Carthage doubled the numbers of triremes (only 60 triremes had escorted the expeditions of 480 and 409) because the Syracusan navy had returned from mainland Greece, posing a severe threat to the Carthaginian expedition. Hannibal, before sailing with the main fleet, sent 40 triremes to Sicily, where these ships met the Greek fleet stationed at Eryx and lost fifteen of their number in a skirmish. The main Punic fleet then set sail, led by a vanguard of 50 triremes, while the rest sailed with the main fleet. The outnumbered Greek ships now gave way and the Punic expedition safely landed near Motya.Church, Alfred J. Carthage, p. 33. Nature of opposing forces The Libyans supplied both heavy and light infantry and formed the most disciplined units of the army. The heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The Heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields and short thrusting swords.Goldsworthy, Adrian, The fall of Carthage, p 32 Campanian, Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,Makroe, Glenn E., Phoenicians, p 84-86 but often were equipped by Carthage. Sicels and other Sicilians were equipped like Greek Hoplites. The Libyans, Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Numidia provided superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge. Carthage at this time did not use elephants, but Libyans provided bulk of the heavy, four horse war chariots for Carthage.Warry, John. Warfare in the Classical World. pp. 98-99. The Punic navy was built around the trireme, Carthaginian citizens usually served alongside recruits from Libya and other Carthaginian domains. =Greek forces= The mainstay of the Greek army was the Hoplite, drawn mainly from the citizens, but a large number of mercenaries from Italy and Greece as well. Sicels and other native Sicilians also served in the army as hoplites and also supplied peltasts, and a number of Campanians, probably equipped like Samnite or Etruscan warriors,Warry, John. Warfare in the Classical World. p. 103. were present as well. The Phalanx was the standard fighting formation of the army. The cavalry was recruited from wealthier citizens and hired mercenaries. In a siege situation, old men and women served as impromptu peltasts. Large Sicilian cities like Syracuse and Akragas field up to 10,000 – 20,000 citizens,Diodorus Siculus, X.III.84 augmented by mercenaries or freed slaves whenever needed. There is no mention of an Akragan navy, but the relief force had 30 triremes. Siege of Akragas The Carthaginian army was unopposed by the Greeks when they marched towards Akragas in the early summer of 406 BC. Hannibal left his warships at Motya before setting out for Akragas. The citizens of Akragas, not wanting to face the Carthaginians by themselves or contribute to their spoils, had gathered the harvest and the entire population (some 200,000 people)Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, p46 within the city as part of their preparations. Hannibal began preparation for the siege in earnest once his army reached Akragas. Two fortified camps were built, one camp (protected by a ditch and palisade) on the western side of Akragas on the right bank of river Hypsas, the other on the left bank of the river Akragas, housing about a third of the army, on the east side of the city, blocking the roads to Gela.Kern, Paul B. Ancient Siege Warfare, p168-69 The Akragans did not oppose these activities, but stayed within their city. Hannibal offered terms to the city before commencing hostilities: Akragas would either become an ally of Carthage or stay neutral while Carthage dealt with the other Greeks in Sicily. Both conditions were rejected by the Akragan government.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p149 The entire male population of the city was armed and posted on the walls, the mercenaries were placed on the hill of Athena (some argue they were posted at the acropolis)Kern, Paul B. Ancient Siege Warfare, p379 note-41, and some troops were placed in reserve to plug any gaps created by the Carthaginians on the city walls. After the final preparations were made, the Greeks awaited the Carthaginian assault. Hannibal decided not to build circumventing walls but to starve the Greeks into submission. The position of the city on high ground made it difficult to assault directly or storm from several directions at once. Hannibal chose to use two siege towers to assault one of the gates on the west side of the city. The Carthaginians managed to inflict casualties on the defenders, but after an all-day struggle, could not force the gate. At night the Greeks made a sortie and burnt the towers down.Diod. 13.85.5, 13.86.1 Hannibal then ordered his soldiers to tear down the tombs and other buildings outside the walls to make siege ramps, so any part of the city wall could be assaulted by siege engines. The Punic soldiers were uneasy about desecrating tombs, and they panicked when a plague broke out in the Carthaginian camps. The Carthaginians lost many men, including Hannibal himself. The siege fails Himilco now assumed command of the Punic army. His first duty was to restore the morale of his soldiers, which he did by sacrificing a child to the god the Greeks associated with Cronos and some animals to the sea by drowning them, after putting a stop to the tomb- destroying activities. Then he continued building siege ramps using the materials already collected and also dammed the Hypsas River,Diod. 13.86.3-6 (the course of which made it act as a moat for Akragas), for gaining better access to the city. At this point Daphnaeus of Syracuse arrived with 30,000 hoplites and 5,000 cavalry to break the siege, accompanied by thirty triremes. The Greek army may have been larger as light troops are not included in the tally.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p170 Himilco led the mercenaries in the eastern camp to intercept this army, while the main army stayed in their camp and kept the garrison of Akragas in check. A battle was joined somewhere on the right bank of the River Himera (the actual battle site is unidentified and subject to debate). The Punic army at first managed to create difficulties for the Italian Greeks stationed on the left of the Greek battle line, but the Syracusan right wing scattered their Punic counterparts before the Carthaginians gained any decisive advantage. The Greeks ultimately managed to defeat the Carthaginians in a hotly contested battle.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p39 The Punic army fled the field leaving almost 6,000 dead behind. Daphnaeus chose to regroup his soldiers before giving chase. As the fleeing Carthaginians retreated past Akragas, the city dwellers clamored to be led out to attack the enemy, which their generals (including the Spartan Dexippus), refused to do, fearing a repeat of the Himera debacle of 409 BC. The victory of the Syracusan-led army, which had not pursued the retreating Carthaginians also fearing a counterattack, had lifted the siege of the city, and the eastern camp of the Carthaginian army had fallen into Greek hands. This positioned the Greeks favorably against the Punic army, with the initiative firmly in their hands. =Conspiracy theories and consequences= The Akragan citizens joined the relief army at the captured Punic camp, and at once gossip spread among the Greeks that the Akragan generals had refused to attack the Carthaginian fugitives because they had been bribed by Himilco. An impromptu political council was held, and the Greeks of Camarina openly accused the five Akragan generals of treason,Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p39 and four of the generals were stoned to death as a result. The fifth, named Argeus, was spared because of his youth. New officers were then elected to replace the generals. Daphnaeus, in overall command of the Greek army, scouted the main Carthaginian camp, and decided against a direct assault. The Greeks instead harassed the Carthaginians throughout the summer with light troops and cavalry, cutting off their supply lines and continuously skirmishing. The Greek army at Akragas was kept supplied by huge ship convoys carrying provisions from Syracuse. The Carthaginians soon faced food shortages, and the mercenaries began to grow restless as starvation set in in the Punic camp. Himilco managed to keep the army together with difficulty. As winter approached, the situation grew from serious to desperate for the Carthaginians. Himilco triumphs The Carthaginians learned of the approach of a supply convoy from Syracuse. Himilco managed to convince the mercenaries to stay put for a few more days, by giving them the gold/silver drinking cups of the Carthaginian citizens, then sent word to the Carthaginian fleet to sortie from Motya/Panormus. The Carthaginian fleet of forty ships arrived from the West,Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 150. and managed to surprise the escorting Syracusan fleet, which may have grown complacent due to their command of the sea, and sank eight Greek triremes escorting the grain ships. When the surviving Greek triremes beached themselves, the Carthaginian flotilla captured the entire convoy. This solved the supply problems for Himilco, and caused the Greeks in turn to face the threat of starvation.Diod. 13.88.1-5. =The Greeks fall apart= The capture of the convoy caused rumors of impending food shortage at Akragas, where the population may not have planted any crops because of the ongoing conflict. Himilco secretly bribed the Campanian mercenaries, who deserted Akragas after complaining of food shortages. When the Akragan authorities found the remaining stocks of food inadequate to feed the whole Greek army, the Greek contingent from Magna Graecia also left Akragas.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 171. The rapidly dwindling food stocks persuaded the Akragan authorities to abandon the city. In mid-December, 40,000 people along with the army, marched east for Gela, carrying whatever valuables they could out of the city. The sick, the old and some diehards stayed behind in Akragas. Himilco had little difficulty taking and pillaging the nearly empty city the following morning, putting to sword any who resisted. The siege had lasted for eight months.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p. 42. Aftermath As winter had set in, Himilco did not push onto Gela but encamped at Akragas. The city, the richest in Sicily, was thoroughly plundered, and many priceless pieces of art were shipped to Carthage. The Carthaginian army would stay in the city until the spring of 405, when the campaign for Gela took place. Himilco would demolish the city before marching east. The refugees of Akragas accused Daphnaeus and the other generals of treason in Syracuse.Diod 13.96.3. This caused a great upheaval which ultimately brought Dionysius I of Syracuse to the role of supreme commander, which he ultimately turned into a dictatorship. The city of Akragas, destroyed in 405 BC, would again be populated by Greeks, although it would not reach the level of wealth and power it had previously enjoyed. It would grow powerful enough to oppose both Carthage and Syracuse in the struggle these cities would engage in for the next hundred years.

It is a slender, spindly shrub with relatively long leaves and small white, pink or magenta-coloured flowers in late summer and autumn. Description Verticordia harveyi is a spindly, openly branched shrub which grows to high and wide. The leaves are long, linear in shape, nearly circular in cross-section and terminate in a long point. The flowers are arranged in corymb-like groups, each flower on an erect stalk, long. The floral cup is top-shaped, long, smooth and covered with short, soft hairs. The sepals are white or pink to magenta-coloured, long, with 6 to 8 hairy lobes. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, about , egg-shaped and erect with pointed teeth around their edges and hairs on the outside surface. The staminodes are longer than the stamens, curve inwards and are hairy. The style is long, curved with many short hairs near its tip. Flowering time is from January to April. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia harveyi was first formally described by George Bentham in 1867 and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. The type collection was made by William Henry Harvey near Cape Riche. A similar specimen preserved by George Maxwell in 1860 has been identified as this species, (a syntype) and was probably collected at the same location. The specific epithet (harveyi) honours the Irish botanist who made the type collection. When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Verticordia along with V. crebra, V. helichrysantha, V. plumosa, V. stenopetala, V. sieberi, V. pityrhops and V. fimbrilepis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in deep sand, usually in open Banksia woodland. It is found near Cape Riche, Manypeaks and in the Stirling Range National Park in the Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia halophila is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. It was previously listed as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) but with the discovery of four populations in a national park, the species was judged to be not eligible for listing. Use in horticulture This species can be readily propagated from cuttings but sometimes difficult to grow on, being susceptible to fungal attack. Darker-flowering forms have more horticultural value than the lighter coloured ones as the flowers of the latter type tend to be hidden between the leaves. Specimens are maintained in pots in Kings Park.

Dobley district commissioner Ali Hussein Nuir stated that Sheikh Hassan Turki, a local militant cleric was meeting with leaders of a Mogadishu-based militant group nearby. Varying reports of casualties surfaced with villagers reporting that between four and six people were dead. It is unclear whether these casualties were targets or civilians. Villagers also reported that an aircraft had attacked them, but US military officials denied these reports merely stating that an attack had indeed occurred and that they were looking into the results. At least two previous attacks of a similar nature occurred in 2007 where American forces targeted suspected al-Qaeda operatives in Ras Kamboni as well as in Bargal.

Of the two similar species, one is more common in cultivation and was mistakenly identified as Brassiophoenix schumannii. In 1999, Zona and Estig showed that the commonly cultivated species was instead the type species Brassiophoenix drymophoeoides. The two species are distinguished by their separated geographical locations and minor differences in fruit form.Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms. Portland: Timber Press. / The genus name is a combination of the surname Brass, honoring the first collector L.J. Brass, and Phoenix, another palm genus. Description Both species grow to around 9 m in height on 8 cm trunks culminating in 60 cm tall, slightly bulging crownshafts and sparse leaf crowns. The stiff, unarching leaves are pinnate to 2 m in length, petioles short or absent, the pinnae being regularly spaced and diamond- shaped, 30 cm long and dark green in color. The leaflets are thrice lobed, the center lobe being deepest, forming unusual jagged apices. The inflorescences emerge from beneath the crownshaft, twice branched, with furry ropes of male and female flowers. Brassiophoenix fruit matures to yellow, orange, or red in color, each with one seed.Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) Genera Palmarum - A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore. Lawrence, Kansas: Allen Press. / Distribution and habitat These palms grow in the mixed lowland rain forest of Papua New Guinea. Cultivation While Brassiophoenix palms are not widespread, they have been in cultivation for many years. As with many rain forest palms, they are not tolerant of full sun in youth but will withstand it in maturity. They also require generous amounts of water and a fast-draining, rich soil. Given their tropical origins they also require protection from cold when cultivated.

Description  The first field kitchens were carried in four-wheeled wagons by military units on campaign throughout history. Indeed, this method of feeding a large travelling group of people was often used, such as on the Wagon Trail in late 19th Century America where the Chuckwagon was employed. By the 20th Century, smaller two-wheeled trailers, became common, especially with the invention of locomotive travel. Field Kitchens were often given affectionate nicknames. German field kitchen, Second World War Karl Rudolf Fissler of Idar- Oberstein invented a mobile field kitchen in 1892 that the Germans came to refer to as a Gulaschkanone (Goulash Cannon) because the chimney of the stove resembled ordnance pieces when disassembled and limbered for towing. As technology has advanced, larger trailers have evolved as horses were phased out in favour of motorized vehicles more capable of towing heavier loads. In WWII the mobile canteen was used as a morale booster in the United Kingdom, fitting in with the culture of the tea break and in particular as a result of the successful wartime experiment of the tea lady on productivity and morale. The larger mobile kitchens (now commonly called \\"flying kitchens\\" because of the greater speed with which they can be deployed) can service entire battalions of troops.

A member of Sinn Féin, he is a councillor on Dublin City Council. Election results =Local elections= As Sinn Féin candidate in the 1999 Local Elections for the Dublin South East Inner City Doolan polled 13.38%, coming fourth and missing out on a seat by 62 votes. In 2004 Doolan recontested in the area polling 24.11%, securing the second position. In the 2009 election he polled 11.9% and lost his seat by 259 votes. At the 2014 elections, Doolan contested in the Dublin Ballyfermot Drimnagh area, and topped the poll with 19.28%. =General elections= Doolan contested the 2002 general election, attaining 2,398 first preference votes (7.39%) in Dublin South-East, coming seventh thereby missing out on one of the top four positions. In the 2007 general election he polled 1,599 first preference votes (4.72%) in the same area, again coming seventh. Career As an elected councillor between 2004 and 2009, Doolan called for the easing of restrictions on immigrant workers, and for better fire-safety provisions in apartment construction. He opposed the creation of an energy-from-waste facility at Poolbeg, supported the Shell to Sea campaign and opposed cuts to Dublin public services. After losing his seat in June 2009, Doolan was hired in October as the coordinator for the 'Dublin Citywide Drugs Crisis Campaign', an organisation that promotes a community development approach to tackling the drugs problem. As coordinator Doolan criticised the Government of Ireland for scrapping the once full-time position of 'Minister for National Drugs Strategy' and regulating that role to another Minister with other responsibilities. As well as calling for a full-time junior minister, Doolan and CityWide requested the government scrap proposed funding cuts for drug services, also asking for additional funding for the issue, as well as for community participation and consultation for handling the drugs problem. In September 2011 Doolan left Citywide to take up a post as parliamentary assistant to Peadar Tóibín TD, Sinn Féin spokesperson on enterprise, jobs, innovation and the Gaeltacht. Before being re-elected to Dublin City Council in 2014, Doolan was parliamentary assistant to Brian Stanley TD. Joseph Rafferty controversy Doolan was involved in controversy after a Dubliner, Joseph Rafferty, was shot dead. Rafferty's sister, Esther Uzell-Rafferty, claimed that the IRA had killed her brother, and that Doolan knew the identity of his killer, claims which Doolan denied. Doolan's denial of involvement in the murder was later backed up by a report from Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Ahern stated \\"I don't think there were any instructions given by the IRA,\\" adding: \\"Elements, probably of criminality, claimed they had links with republicans.\\" Doolan has called for public co-operation with the Garda in the investigation of Rafferty's murder. Personal life Doolan is married with four children. He has been a strict vegetarian since he was 16 because of his concerns for the environment.
