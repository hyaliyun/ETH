Montgomery (May 21, 1847 - March 5, 1924) was the son of Ben Montgomery and his wife, and the founder of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, an all- black community. Soon elected mayor, he was an active Republican politician. He participated in the 1890 Mississippi constitutional convention but was unable to prevent adoption of a state constitution that effectively disfranchised black voters for decades, using poll taxes and literacy tests to raise barriers to voter registration. Montgomery was thought to promote an accommodationist position for African Americans, which was sometimes thought of his colleague on race matters, Booker T. Washington, who became head of the Tuskegee Institute. Early life and education Born into slavery, Isaiah was the son of Ben Montgomery, a slave whose owner, Joseph Davis, promoted him to overseer. The younger Montgomery learned to read and write due to his father's influential position on the Davis Bend plantation. Davis wanted to establish a more positive working environment for slaves and encouraged education. Following the end of the American Civil War, Isaiah began a business with his father. It lasted until Ben's death in 1877. His father had long dreamed of establishing an independent black colony; by the time of his death, the Reconstruction era had ended and African Americans struggled to maintain themselves against white supremacists. Career After his father's death in 1877, Isaiah Montgomery worked to realize his father's dream. With his cousin Benjamin T. Green, he bought property in the northwest frontier of Mississippi Delta bottomlands to found Mound Bayou in 1887. Bolivar County was the largest in area in the Delta. As farmers cleared land, they started cultivating cotton. Montgomery worked to gain freedmen protection of the law, and to keep their work and lives separate from supervision by whites. In what the Washington Post termed \\"A Notable Address Delivered by the Colored Statesman,\\" Frederick Douglass gave a speech in October 1890 before the Bethel Literary and Historical Society of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. He strongly condemned Montgomery's stance regarding suffrage in Mississippi. Douglass had spoken of Montgomery numerous times before and on the occasion cited his position as an act of \\"treason, to the cause of the colored people, not only of his own state, but of the United States,\\" referring to the effect Montgomery's act would have in other states. He also lamented having heard in Montgomery \\"a groan of bitter anguish born of oppression and despair\\" and a voice of a \\"soul from which all hope had vanished.\\" References External links * City of Mound Bayou, Mississippi Official Website *Isaiah Montgomery at Find A Grave Category:1847 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Mayors of places in Mississippi Category:People from Mound Bayou, Mississippi Category:Mississippi Republicans Category:19th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Isaiah Montgomery"},{"id":"4514673","text":"Maximilian Fabiani, commonly known as Max Fabiani (, ) (29 April 1865 - 12 August 1962) was a cosmopolitan trilingual architect and town planner of mixed Italian-Austrian ancestry, born in the village of Kobdilj near ≈†tanjel on the Karst Plateau, County of Gorizia and Gradisca, in present-day Slovenia. Together with Ciril Metod Koch and Ivan Vanca≈°, he introduced the Vienna Secession style of architecture (a type of Art Nouveau) in Slovenia.Andrej Hrausky, Janez Ko≈æelj: Maks Fabiani: Dunaj, Ljubljana, Trst., Mladina, 12 August 2010 Life Fabiani was born to Antonio Fabiani, a Friulian latifondist from Paularo of Bergamasque ancestry, and Charlotte von Kofler, a Triestine aristocrat of Tyrolean origin. He grew up in a cosmopolitan trilingual environment: besides Italian, the language of his family, and Slovene, the language of his social environment, he learned German at a very young age.Marco Pozzetto, Max Fabiani, MGS PRESS S.a.s., Trieste (1998) p. 15. He came from a wealthy family that could afford to provide a good education for its 14 children. He attended elementary school in Kobdilj, and the German and Slovene-language Realschule in Ljubljana, where he was the best student in the class after seven years.Jahresbericht f√ºr das Schuljahr, 1883. He later moved to Vienna, where he attended architecture courses at the Vienna University of Technology. After earning his degree in 1889, a scholarship enabled him to travel for three years (1892‚Äì1894) to Asia Minor and through most of Europe. He was married and had two children; his son Lorenzo Fabiani (1907‚Äì1973) was an agronomist and journalist and known anti-fascist. In 1917, Fabiani was named professor at the University of Vienna, and in 1919 one of his pupils, Ivan Vurnik, offered him a teaching position at the newly established University of Ljubljana,Janez Ko≈æelj et al., Ivan Vurnik, slovenski arhitekt - Slovene Architect (Ljubljana: Organizacijski odbor projekta Vurnik, 1994). Fabiani however refused the offer, quit the teaching position in Vienna, and decided to settle in Gorizia, which had been annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, thus becoming an Italian citizen. On 15 May 1921‚Äîless than a year after the burning of the Slovenian National Hall in Trieste by the Italian fascists, which he had designed‚ÄîFabiani became a member of the Italian fascist movement. The reason why he joined the party and his political activity in the following years remain unclear and controversial. At the same time his son was jailed because of his anti-fascist activities. In late 1935, Fabiani (at age 70) accepted the nomination for mayor (podest√†) of his native village of ≈†tanjel. He remained mayor during World War II, using his knowledge of German language and his cultural acquaintances to convince the German troops to spare the village from destruction.Marco Pozzetto, Max Fabiani, MGS PRESS S.a.s., Trieste (1998) p. 72.Neera Gatti, Lettere ad un amica, Ergon S.r.l, Gorizia (1951) p. 26,27. Nevertheless, the monumental fortifications part of the village and castle, which he himself had renovated during the 1930s, were eventually destroyed in the fight between the Wehrmacht and the Slovene partisans. His house with its rich archive in Kobdilj was also burnt down. In 1944, Fabiani relocated back to Gorizia, where he lived until his death on 12 August 1962.Pizzia, Katia. 2001. A City in Search of an Author. London: Sheffield, p. 24. A widely circulated but false story regarding Fabiani is that the young Adolf Hitler once briefly worked in his architecture firm in Vienna. The myth is not supported by any sources, and it appears to have been fabricated in 1966. Work Urania Palace in Vienna Upon returning to Vienna, he joined the studio of the architect Otto Wagner on Wagner's personal invitation, and stayed there until the end of the century. During this period he did not only concentrate his interests on design, but also cultivated his vocation as town planner and passionately devoted himself to teaching. How much he influenced Wagner's book about architecture is unknown. Fabiani's first large-scale architectural project was the urban plan for the Carniolan, now Slovenian capital Ljubljana, which was badly damaged by the April 1895 Ljubljana earthquake. Fabiani won a competition against the more historicist architect Camillo Sitte, and was chosen by the Ljubljana Town Council as the main urban planner. One of the reasons for this choice was Fabiani was considered by the Slovene Liberal Nationalists as a Slovene.Breda Miheliƒç, Urbanistiƒçni razvoj Ljubljane (Ljubljana: Partizanska knjiga, 1983), 10. Second reason was that he knew Ljubljana better than Sitte and prepared really good and modern plan. With the personal sponsorship of the Liberal nationalist mayor of Ljubljana Ivan Hribar, Fabiani designed several important buildings in the town, including the L-shaped secondary school for girls in the Mladika Complex facing Pre≈°eren Street (), which is now the seat of the Slovenian Foreign Ministry. Ferrari garden at ≈†tanjel, Karst, Slovenia His work in Ljubljana helped him to become well known in the Slovene Lands, convincing Slovene liberal nationalists in the Austrian Littoral to entrust him with the design for the National Halls in Gorizia (1903) and in Trieste (1904).Marko Kravos et al., Narodni dom v Trstu, 1904-1920 (Trieste-Duino, 1995). Fabiani also created the urban plan for Bielsko in Poland. In 1902, these two urban plans won him the first honorary doctorate in the field of urban planning by the University of Vienna in Austria-Hungary. During the 1920s, he coordinated a large scale reconstruction of villages and some historical monuments in the areas in the Julian March that had been devastated by the Battles of the Isonzo during World War I. Notable works The most notable works designed by Fabiani include: * Vila Schlegel, Opatija * Palace Portois & Fix (Vienna, 1898) * Palace Artaria, Kohlmarkt (Vienna, 1900) * Lyceum, Mladika Palace (Ljubljana, 1907) * Krisper House (Ljubljana, 1901) * Bamberg House (Ljubljana, 1906) * Palace Urania (Vienna, 1902) * Revenue Office building (Gorizia, 1903) * National Hall (Trieste, 1904) * Pre≈°eren Square and the Pre≈°eren Monument (Ljubljana, unveiled in 1905) * Stabile Palace (Trieste, 1906) * the urban development plan for Ljubljana (1895) * Villa Wechsler (Vienna, 1911) * San Germano church (Brijuni, 1912) * the plan for the reconstruction of Gorizia (1921) * the general urban development plan for Venice (1952) * Restoration of Gorizia duomo (Gorizia, 1919) * The general urban development plan of Monfalcone, Italy (1919) * Villa Bigot (Gorizia, 1921) * Pellegrini's home in Gorizia (1922) * Felberbaum's home in Gorizia (1925) * San Giorgio church (Lucinico, 1927) * Ferrari garden (≈†tanjel, 1930‚Äì40) * Sacro Cuore metropolitan church (Gorizia, 1934) * \\"Tower of memory\\", memorial to the Italian soldiers who died in World War I (Gorizia, 1937) * Casa del Fascio (House of Fascism) (≈†tanjel, 1938) Awards * Italian Order of Merit for Culture and Art - Rome, 10 September 1951.

The city acts as seat to the municipal government of the Santa Ana Canton.  Geography  Santa Ana has an area of km¬≤ and an elevation of metres.  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Santa Ana had a population of inhabitants. The population accounts for approximately 20% of the canton's population. It is currently the second most populous district in the Santa Ana Canton after the district of Pozos. Male: 5,563 Female: 6,212 Male to Female Ratio: 1:1.12 Economy The city of Santa Ana still maintains its traditional feel of a typical Costa Rican town with its small stores, bars, restaurants offering local and international cuisine and Sunday fresh fruit and vegetable markets. Nonetheless, Santa Ana has been recently experiencing real estate and commercial development unprecedented in the entire Central Valley. It has become the place of choice with upscale grocery stores, gourmet restaurants, banks, gas stations, medical and dental clinics, beauty salons, coffee houses, hotels, private schools, and small commercial centers springing up everywhere. The city itself is within a few minutes of the surging business locale of Lindora, in the Pozos district, adding to the availability of commercial, lodging and residential areas. Transportation National routes in the district or nearby include: *25px National Route 27: Connecting San Jos√© and Caldera, Puntarenas, passes within a mile of the city of Santa Ana. This has recently allowed faster travel to the Pacific coast, an average of 45 minutes from Santa Ana. The capital city of San Jose is also within 15‚Äì20 minutes thanks to this route. Although no distinction is legally made between freeways and tollways, Route 27 qualifies as the latter. The first two ramps (underpasses) in the San Jose-Caldera (West) direction service the Santa Ana district, the second being Route 147. These ramps have no exit tolls. *25px National Route 121: Runs through the Santa Ana district overlapping most of 5th St and 3rd Ave. It connects the county with neighboring Escazu (East) and Mora (West). It is considered the main alternative to Route 27. Nevertheless, it does not have the same vehicle capacity due to its single-lane and curving layout. *25px National Route 147: Connects the Santa Ana district with the neighboring cantons of San Rafael, Alajuela and Belen, Heredia. However, due to the growing enterprises and commercial sector in Lindora, Route 147 faces daily congestion. *25px National Route 310: Begins in the Santa Ana district and continues through Pozos northwards, parallel to Route 147. It runs through Route 27 without any official ramps connecting them. Since Route 310 runs through Pozos, connecting to Escazu, it is still an alternate route to Route 27. It is not recommended unless the previous routes are heavily congested. Route 310 ends in Route 121 in the Escazu canton after once more passing through Route 27 (with connecting ramps) due to its southwards facing U-shape. *25px National Route 311: Connects the district with the Salitral district to the south. The route ends in the town of Salitral.  Public transportation  Bus routes in Santa Ana are yet to be officially named and numbered. Buses serving the Santa Ana- Escazu-San Jose routes are currently identified by their blue color scheme. The route is currently managed by CILT. Buses serving the Santa Ana-Belen route follow a predominantly white with violet stripes scheme. The route each bus takes is indicated on the windshield without following any defined standards; passengers may ask the bus driver for clarification if needed. Fees for each route are set by the national authority- they cannot be modified and must be indicated and paid upon entry. There are discount plans available for 'Golden Citizens' (elderly residents) upon request at the local government offices exclusive to the Santa Ana-Escazu-San Jose bus services. Santa Ana's authorized taxi service is officially located on Main St (Calle Central), in front of the church as well as further north (between Central & 5th Ave). Official taxi services follow the national standards: Red-colored with yellow triangles on the side indicating their permit number; licence plates begin with TSJ (Taxi San Jose). Taxi services with official plates from other provinces (TH, TP, etc.) are not permitted to begin their service in San Jose and vice versa. They can, nonetheless, begin their service within their permitted province and finish it elsewhere. Since Santa Ana is located in the Province of San Jose, said limitations apply to non-TSJ plate wielders except Airport Shuttles and Taxis which operate freely in all provinces but are only available if called or at the airport. Culture and education The Santa Ana district's public education is served by the Andres Bello primary (elementary) school. The secondary education cycle (middle & high school) is offered by the Liceo de Santa Ana located in the neighboring district of Uruca. Santa Ana hosts the United World College of Costa Rica which offers the IB program for international students. The new Municipal Building of Culture houses the Municipal School of Integrated Arts (locally known as the EMAI for its Spanish acronym) which excels in its music program. It also features an art gallery, an auditorium, multipurpose rooms, municipal office spaces and a variety of murals adorning its contemporary facade. Sports Golfers in Santa Ana have access to the Parque Valle del Sol golf course located in Lindora, Santa Ana. It is the first and the only professional golf course in Costa Rica open to the public in the Central Valley. The 18-hole championship golf course was designed by Tracy May in 1994 to be challenging and fair under most conditions and downright tough when the strong winds come down from the surrounding mountains. Due to its diverse layout, golfers are required to use all of the clubs in their bag throughout the game. The Santa Ana district has two municipal soccer fields and a municipal gymnasium. Public courts used mostly for basketball are adjacent to the main soccer field which faces the church. The current state of the roads and sidewalks make urban cycling and jogging slightly more risky than in other communities. There is an ongoing effort from the local government authorities to increase parks & recreation, an undeveloped aspect of Santa Ana's urban landscape. Santa Ana's is home to premier Mixed Martial Arts and Personal Training studios like MMA Costa Rica and Fight & Fitness.

Processes may concern administration, service delivery, decision making and policy making. E-participation is hence closely related to e-government and e-governance participation.H. Jafarkarimi; A. T. H. Sim; R. Saadatdoost and J. M. Hee (2014). The Impact of ICT on Reinforcing Citizens‚Äô Role in Government Decision Making, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Vol.4 (1) The need for the term has emerged as citizen interests have received less attention than those of the service providers in e-government development. It also emerged as the need to distinguish between the roles of citizen and customer has become more pressing. A more detailed definition sees e-participation as \\"the use of information and communication technologies to broaden and deepen political participation by enabling citizens to connect with one another and with their elected representatives\\". This definition includes all stakeholders in democratic decision-making processes and not only citizen related top-down government initiatives. So e-participation can be seen as part of e-democracy, the use of ICT by governments in general used by elected officials, media, political parties and interest groups, civil society organizations, international governmental organizations, or citizens/voters within any of the political processes of states/regions, nations, and local and global communities. The complexity of e-participation processes results from the large number of different participation areas, involved stakeholders, levels of engagement, and stages in policy making. .  History  The term \\"e-participation\\" originated in the early 2000s and draws generally on three developments. # The general development in CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) and groupware directed towards collaborative environments to support human ICT-mediated interaction, both work-related and social. # Developments in e-democracy since the late 1990s, where interest rapidly evolved from e-voting to several forms of ICT-supported and -enabled interaction between governments and citizens, including not only direct ones (such as consultations, lobbying, petitioning and polling) but also ones pursued outside of government itself, including electioneering, campaigning, and community informatics. To a large extent, the institutional framework conditions of the chosen democratic model define at which part of the democratic processes participation is permitted (such as direct or representative democracy, or any intermediate forms).Hilbert, Martin (2007). \\"Digital Processes and Democratic Theory: Dynamics, risks and opportunities that arise when democratic institutions meet digital information and communication technologies.\\" open-access online book. # The development in e-government towards increasingly complex service-delivery. Complex services require considerable interaction including searching, selecting options based on multiple criteria, calculating outcomes, notifications, inquiries, complaints, and many other activities. There are several ICT tools for such tasks, ranging from FAQs to call centres, but there is a need to coordinate all these into user-friendly but powerful toolsets for client-organization encounters. Because interaction in such contexts is complex, and because goals have to be reached, the arenas where it takes places become social arenas for ICT-supported participation.  On the definition  The term 'participation' means taking part in joint activities for the purpose of reaching a common goal. This encompasses both trivial situations in which participation mainly has a technical meaning, ‚Äùdoing things together‚Äù. For example, a football team needs 11 players, and dancing often requires two or more people acting in a coordinated manner. But participation, even in trivial situations, also has a goal-oriented aspect which means decision making and control are involved. Participation in political science and theory of management refers to direct public participation in political, economical or management decisions. The two are not completely separated but belong on a spectrum of complexity and context. When participation becomes complicated, decision making becomes necessary. Hence, any participatory process is potentially important for the rule system governing the activities. In terms of points 2 and 3 above, this means that when service processes become complex, the implementation of them will not be in all details based on political decisions but also on what is found to be practical. Instead of taking in and accepting knowledge as is disseminated by the media and government, by participating, one becomes an active citizen and further contributes to a democratic society. When such practical doings become implemented in government (e)service systems, they will affect decision making, as many changes will later be hard to make simply because existing procedures are implemented in ICT systems and government agencies‚Äô procedures. There are many theories dealing with institutionalization, for example structuration theory, institutional theory, and actor-network theory. These theories all, in different ways, deal with how \\"ways of doing things\\" become established or rejected, and how those that become established increasingly affect the ways we \\"normally\\" do things. Alternatively, when viewed from the citizen‚Äôs perspective the capability approach is being applied to understand the ‚Äúbeings and doings‚Äù of individuals. This approach allows institutions to identify normative capabilities that can improve citizen‚Äôs opportunities to participate in the governance process.  Models and tools  A number of tools and models have emerged as part of Web 2.0 that can be used or inspire the design of architecture for e-participation. In particular, \\"the emergence of online communities oriented toward the creation of useful products suggests that it may be possible to design socially mediating technology that support public- government collaborations\\" .  Participation tools  * Wikis * Online social networking * Blogs  Mechanisms  * Electronic voting * Reputation systems * Internet petitions * Transparency tools (social translucence mechanisms)  Tracking and analysis  * Digital traces * Data mining * Data visualization * Simulations such as agent-based social simulation  Crowdsourcing  To demonstrate e-participation at work, one can turn to one of its types - crowdsourcing. This is generally defined as the enlisting of a group of humans to solve problems via the World Wide Web. The idea is that this platform is able to collect human resources from the most unlikely and remotest places, contributing to the general store of intellectual capital. Crowdsourcing can be applied in different stages of the policy-making process and these could transpire on the information, consultation, and active participation levels. At the information level, there is a one-way relationship, wherein the participants receive information from the government. The consultation process entails a two-way interaction where citizens already provide their inputs, feedback, and reactions. Finally, active participation can refer to the deeper participatory involvement where citizens directly contribute in the formulation of policy content. This level of e-participation is increasingly being practiced through tools such as online petition, e-referendum, e-panels, citizen e-juries, and participatory GIS, among others.  European eParticipation actions   European eParticipation Preparatory Action  eParticipation is the Preparatory Action lasts for three years (2006‚Äì2008). The EU is taking the lead in using online tools to improve the legislative process for its citizens. eParticipation which launched on January 1, 2007 will run as a series of linked projects which each contribute to a greater awareness and involvement by citizens in the legislation process from initial drafting to implementation at a regional and local level. The individual projects will concentrate on ensuring that the legislative language and process is more transparent, understandable and accessible to citizens. In addition the projects emphasis on the communication of legislation will be used to enhance and grow citizens' involvement and contribution in the process of creating and implementing the legislation. So far, 21 projects have been funded. The European Parliament, national parliaments and local and regional authorities are actively involved. State- of-the-art ICT tools are being tested to facilitate the writing of legal texts, including translation into different languages, and the drafting of amendments as well as making the texts easier for non-specialists to find and understand. New digital technologies are also being used to give citizens easier access to information and more opportunity to influence decisions that affect their lives. A report , which was published as a MOMENTUM white paper, highlights the major facts and figures of those projects while providing some initial policy recommendations for future use.  European eParticipation Actions  The European Commission has now launched a number of actions aiming at further advancing the work of supporting eParticipation. Examples: * FP7 : ICT Challenge 7 : Objective ICT-2009.7.3 ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling. The European Commission has launched some call in this area to finance researches. Currently the Integrated Program Future Policy Modelling (FUPOL) is the largest project in this domain. FUPOL * CIP ICT Policy Support Programme (or ICT PSP). The European project has open a call in the programme CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Framework) on the Theme 3: ICT for government and governance See also *Collaborative e-democracy *Direct democracy *E-democracy *eGovernment *Electronic civil disobedience *eRulemaking *Emergent democracy *Hacktivism *Internet activism *Online consultation *Online deliberation *Online participation *Online petition *Open politics *Open source governance *Parliamentary informatics *Participatory democracy *Radical transparency *Second Superpower *Smart mob *Spatial Citizenship *Social translucence *Virtual volunteering * YoDono  Notes  References  *Huffman, B.

He served as a member of the Knesset for Likud and Kadima between 2003 and 2011, and is also a former Minister of Finance. Biography Bar-On was born in Tel Aviv shortly after Israeli independence in 1948. After his national service, in which he rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, he studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Whilst working as a lawyer he became a Justice in the Military Court of Appeals in the West Bank. In 1997 he was appointed Attorney General, but resigned as a consequence of heavy criticism related to the 'Bar-On Hebron' scandal, which involved allegations against chief officials that they recommended Bar-On to the position for personal reasons. Bar-On resigned within 48 hours. Prior to his political career, Bar-On served, among others, as Chairman of the Council for the Organisation of Sport Gambling (1998‚Äì2001), member of the Central Committee of the Israel Bar (1995‚Äì2003) and the Jerusalem Regional Committee of the Israeli Bar, as well as a member of the Council for the Administrative Courts, the Advisory Commission to the Government Companies Authority and the Public Defenders Commission.

He was also credited as Hans Billan, Phillip Halliday, and Christian Kessler. Early career Billian originally wanted to become an opera singer but due to the deterioration of his voice during his nine years in military service he had to abandon this plan. After World War II, he settled in West Germany and started to work as an actor at theatres in Hamburg and Wolfenb√ºttel. He later began to work also as a director's assistant. In 1950, he started to work for various German film producers. Especially, his work for Constantin-Film proved to be successful until 1961 when he left this company to work as a freelance screenwriter and director. Until the late 1960s, he wrote films or directed films that fell under the category Heimatfilm, such as Ich kauf' mir lieber einen Tirolerhut in 1965. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he directed softcore sex comedies, like Pudelnackt in Oberbayern (1969) (a Bavarian sex comedy pioneer), Die Jungfrauen von Bumshausen (Run, Virgin, Run) (1970), and Das M√§dchen mit der hei√üen Masche (Loves of a French Pussycat) (1972) (starring Sybil Danning). Pornographic films In 1973, Billian directed hardcore short-length loops for the Swedish company Venus Film. When the ban on hardcore pornography was lifted in Germany, he started to direct numerous short-length hardcore films there. In 1975, he directed the first German full-length hardcore feature film, Bienenstich im Liebesnest (soft version known as Im Gasthaus zum scharfen Hirschen, also known as Zimmerm√§dchen machen es gern). In 1976, he directed Josefine Mutzenbacher...wie sie wirklich war? 1. Teil (Sensational Janine) about the early life of Viennese courtesan Josephine Mutzenbacher. The film that had the title role played by Patricia Rhomberg who also had an intimate relationship with Billian was his greatest success. During this period, Billian continued to shoot loops, a number of which attracted particular attention such as Massagesalon Elvira that featured Anne Magle, the Danish porn sensation of the '70s. Josefine Mutzenbacher...wie sie wirklich war? 1. Teil was conceived by Billian as the first part of a Josefine Mutzenbacher series but when the producer Gunter Otto of Herzog refused to finance a second part, Billian took the money from the production company Starlight and directed Die Beichte der Josefine Mutzenbacher (Josephine) in 1979. However, Otto who held the rights for the title released Josefine Mutzenbacher...wie sie wirklich war? 2. Teil (Professional Janine) in 1980. Both films were unable to reach the success of the 1976 film, particularly due to absence of Rhomberg and lack of continuity with the first film. In 1981 (Aus dem Tagebuch der Josefine Mutzenbacher ), 1987 (Die Liebesschule der Josefine Mutzenbacher ) & 1991 Billian directed three further Josefine Mutzenbacher titles. Gunter Otto made consecutive Josefine movies (Josefine Mutzenbacher ‚Äì Wie sie wirklich war: 3,4,5,6. Teil) from 1982 to 1984. In the 1990s, he directed porn videos, especially for the producer Tabu of Bochum, but these videos fell far from the quality of his work in the 1970s.

(listen) Le Plombier A thoroughly farcical song about a grotesque plumber sharing the name of ice hockey great Guy Lafleur, speaking fanatically about wrestling not being fake. The song grew out of a bet made to J-F Pauz√© by singer Karl Tremblay to manage writing a song with bizarre, random expressions like Jaromir Jagr haircut, butt crack and Velveeta.

(listen) Mon Pays Mon Pays, suivi du Reel des Aristocrates is a very amusing song which ends in a long reel and laying down the ludicrous theory that much of the Quebec independence-related defeats of the Quebec people throughout its history (the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the Lower Canada Rebellion and the October Crisis) are caused by an almost endemic tradition of drunkenness. The Patriotes rebelled, the English regime will have to fall, they got out their ceintures fl√©ch√©es! The Patriotes all agreed: to achieve victory, we will have to stop drinking! (listen live) Le Gars d'la compagnie It's about Trois-Rivi√®res workers and the Quebec forest, as well as aboriginals, being exploited by American businessmen before the Quiet Revolution.

The designation √ñV 4 stands for \\"√ñppen Vagn 4 cylindrar\\" in Swedish, which means Open Carriage, 4 cylinders. The model √ñV 4 was often referred to as \\"Jakob\\" but that was just a name for one of the 10 pre-series √ñV 4 that was ready on 25 July, Jakob's name day. All 10 prototypes were assembled in Stockholm at the company AB Galco, H√§lsingegatan 41 where Gustav Larson worked at that time. Only one of the 10 pre-series cars manufactured during 1926 was saved for posterity and is housed at the Volvo Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden. History Replica of body frame One of about 70 Volvo √ñV 4 TV light trucks made The engine was designed by Gustav Larson and its main chassis components by Jan G. Smith, a designer who had worked many years in the American automobile industry and returned to Sweden in 1924. Many of Jan G. Smith's original drawings for the √ñV4 and other technical papers that he collected in America are saved in the archive of the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.The original drawings can be photographed at the National museum, referred to in this article. When the first series produced √ñV4 was about to drive out of the factory and engineer Eric Carlberg put it into first gear, the car went backwards, where the car was actually in reverse gear. The explanation was that the differential gear in the rear axle had been fitted incorrectly. This mistake delayed the introduction by one day and the official introduction day for the √ñV4 was then adjusted to 14 April 1927, the day AB Volvo officially says the automobile company Volvo was \\"born\\"-- this is from a marketing point of view. The company as an automobile company was born as a subsidiary company to SKF on 10 August 1926. Models Volvo PV 4, the covered version of √ñV 4. This is the original design which was soon revised The cabriolet was not very successful in the Swedish climate; the covered version, PV 4, was introduced in the summer of 1927. This had a Weymann body and the original design was rather ungainly. Helmer MasOlle, who had been inspired by his personal Voisin C5 when he designed the original √ñV 4, was reportedly furious about the PV 4 and would not be associated with it. By 1928 a more balanced design was introduced, with a longer bonnet and thinner pillars. The oval rear window of the original PV 4 was gradually replaced by a rectangular unit. Volvo √ñV 4 Touring 1928 Between 1927 and 1929 a total of 996 cars were manufactured. Of these 694 were PV 4 and 302 √ñV 4\\\\. 251 of the covered cars were of the \\"PV 4 Special\\" model. The √ñV 4 production includes 27 naked chassis and 70 small pickup trucks (√ñV 4 TV) developed for Telegrafverket, the royal telecommunications company. Some of these light trucks were sold to other customers. The TV model has a small convertible top mounted just behind the front seats, with a cargo area behind.

He paid a high price for such actions: fifteen months living underground, seventeen years of imprisonment and eight years of exile. He returned to Morocco in September 1999. Life and politics Abraham Serfaty was born in Casablanca, on January 16, 1926, to a middle-class Sephardi liberal humanistic Jewish family originally from Tangier . He graduated in 1949 of √âcole des Mines de Paris one of the most prominent French engineering Grandes √©coles. His path as a political activist started very early: in February 1944, he joined the Moroccan Youth Communists, and, upon his arrival in France in 1945, the French Communist Party. When he returned to Morocco in 1949, he joined the Moroccan Communist Party. His anti-colonialist fight had him arrested and jailed by the French authorities, and in 1950 he was assigned a forced residence in France for six years. On the morrow of Morocco's independence, he encumbered several, more technical than political, posts and was part of the Ministry of Economy from 1957 to 1960. During that time, he has been one of the many promoters of the new mining policy of the newly independent Morocco. From 1960 to 1968, he was the director of the Research- Development of the Cherifian Office of Phosphates, but revoked of his duties because of his solidarity with miners at one strike. From 1968 to 1972, he taught at the Engineers School of Mohammedia, and at the same time, collaborated at the \\"Souffles/Anfas\\" artistic journal, headed by Abdellatif Laabi. Abraham Serfaty was a Moroccan Jew, but also an anti-Zionist Jew who did not recognize the State of Israel and was outraged by what he saw as the mistreatment of the Palestinians. In 1970, Serfaty left the Communist Party, which he considered to be too doctrinarian and became deeply involved in the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist left-wing organization called \\"Ila al- Amam\\" (En Avant in French, Forward in English). In January 1972, he was arrested for the first time and savagely tortured, but released after heavy popular pressure. As he was again targeted for his continuing fight, Serfaty went underground in March 1972, with one of his friends Abdellatif Zeroual, who was also wanted by the authorities. It was then that he met for the first time Christine Daure, a French teacher who then helped both men to hide. After several months of hiding, Abraham Serfaty and Abdellatif Zeroual were arrested again in 1974. After their arrest, Abdellatif Zeroual died, a victim of torture. In October 1974, at \\"Derb Moulay Ch√©rif\\", center of \\"interrogation\\" = (torture) in Casablanca, Abraham Serfaty was one of the five culprits sentenced to life in prison. He was officially charged with \\"plotting against the State's security\\", but the heavy sentence seemed to have been more a result for his attitude against the annexing of the Western Sahara, even if this motif did not appear in the official indictment, than his political activism. He then served seventeen years at the Kenitra prison, where, thanks to Danielle Mitterrand's help, he was able to marry his biggest supporter, Christine Daure. Exile and return International pressure was enough in Serfaty's favor that he was finally released from prison in September 1991, but immediately banished from Morocco and deprived of his Moroccan nationality on grounds that his father was Brazilian. He found a haven in France, with his wife, Christine Daure-Serfaty. From 1992 to 1995, Serfaty taught at the University of Paris-VIII, in the department of political sciences, on the theme of \\"identities and democracy in the Arab world\\". Eight years after his exile and two months after the death of King Hassan II, he was finally allowed by the new king to return to Morocco in September 1999, and had his Moroccan passport restored to him. He then settled at Mohammedia with his wife Christine in a house made available to them and even received a monthly stipend. In the same year, he was appointed Advisor to the National Moroccan Office of Research and Oil Exploitation (Onarep). This nomination did not stop him for asking, in December 2000, the then Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi to resign after the attacks on the independent newspapers and magazines and restrictions of their rights and freedom of speech. Serfaty died in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2010. Abraham Serfaty was a fervent anti-Zionist, to the extent that he declared that Zionism had nothing to do with Judaism. He moreover stated that the Jews had no right to Palestine, especially Jerusalem and the Western Wall. He stated that it was all lies to make them part of Judaism. He led several demonstrations supporting the Palestinian people, especially during Israeli air raids on Gaza, stating that Jerusalem was the capital of Palestine and that the Jews, especially Israeli Jews, were liars, criminals, and had no right to it. He lived, upon his return to Morocco from exile isolated and avoided by the rest of the Jewish Moroccan community. Only two official representatives of the Moroccan Jewish community were present at his burial. His funeral at the Jewish cemetery in Rabat was solely attended by Moroccan Muslims, on account of his political stance regarding the Palestinian issue. Abraham Serfaty was the co-author, with his wife Christine, of the book The Other's Memory (La M√©moire de l'Autre), published in 1993.

The Karrick process is a low- temperature carbonization (LTC) and pyrolysis process of carbonaceous materials. Although primarily meant for coal carbonization, it also could be used for processing of oil shale, lignite or any carbonaceous materials. These are heated at to in the absence of air to distill out synthetic fuels‚Äìunconventional oil and syngas. It could be used for a coal liquefaction as also for a semi-coke production. The process was the work of oil shale technologist Lewis Cass Karrick at the United States Bureau of Mines in the 1920s. History The Karrick process was invented by Lewis Cass Karrick in the 1920s. Although Karrick did not invent coal LTC as such, he perfected the existing technologies resulting the Karrick process. The retort used for the Karrick process based on the Nevada‚ÄìTexas‚ÄìUtah Retort, used for the shale oil extraction. In 1935, a Karrick LTC pilot plant was constructed in the coal research laboratory at the University of Utah. Commercial-size processing plants were operated during the 1930s in Colorado, Utah and Ohio. During World War II, similar processing plant was operated by the United States Navy. In Australia, during World War II the Karrick process plants were used for shale oil extraction in New South Wales. In 1950s‚Äì1970s, the technology was used by the Rexco Company in its Snibston plant at Coalville in Leicestershire, England. Process The Karrick process is a low-temperature carbonization process, which uses a hermetic retort. For commercial scale production, a retort about in diameter and high would be used. The process of carbonization would last about 3 hours. Superheated steam is injected continuously into the top of a retort filled by coal. At first, in contact with cool coal, the steam condenses to water acting as a cleaning agent. While temperature of coal rises, the destructive distillation starts. Coal is heated at to in the absence of air. The carbonization temperature is lower compared with to for producing metallurgic coke. The lower temperature optimizes the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar, and therefore it is suitable for processing into fuels. Resulting water, oil and coal tar, and syngas moves out from retort through outlet valves at the bottom of the retort. The residue (char or semi-coke) remains in the retort. While the produced liquids are mostly a by-product, the semi-coke is the main product, a solid and smokeless fuel. The Karrick LTC process generates no carbon dioxide, but it does produce a significant amount of carbon monoxide. Products In the Karrick process, 1 short ton of coal yields up to 1 barrel of oils and coal tars (12% by weight), and produces of rich coal gas and of solid smokeless char or semi-coke (for one metric ton, 0.175 m¬≥ of oils and coal tars, 95 m¬≥ of gas, and 750 kg of semi-coke). Yields by volume of approximately 25% gasoline, 10% kerosene and 20% good quality fuel oil are obtainable from coal. Gasoline obtained from coal by the Karrick process combined with cracking and refining is equal in quality to tetraethyl lead gasolines. More power is developed in internal combustion engines and an increase in fuel economy of approximately 20% is obtainable under identical operating conditions. Semi-coke can be used for utility boilers and coking coal in steel smelters, yields more heat than raw coal and can be converted to water gas. Water gas can be converted to oil by the Fischer-Tropsch process. Coal gas from Karrick LTC yields greater energy content than natural gas. Phenolic wastes are used by the chemical industry as feedstock for plastics, etc. Electrical power can be cogenerated at nominal equipment cost. Economic viability Oils, including petroleum, have long been extracted from coal. Production plants were merely shut down in the 1880s because crude oil became cheaper than coal liquefaction. The capability itself, however, has never disappeared. Eight years of pilot plant tests by Karrick attest that states, cities or even smaller towns, could make their own gas and generate their own electricity. A 30-ton plant and oil refinery will show a profit over and above all operating and capital costs and the products will sell at attractive prices for equivalent products. The private sector should require no subsidies, but not in competition with those who skim off the oil from coal and sell the residual smokeless fuel to power plants. The cheapest liquid fuel from coal will come when processed by LTC for both liquid fuels and electric power. As a tertiary product of the coal distilling process, electrical energy can be generated at a minimum equipment cost. A Karrick LTC plant with 1 kiloton of daily coal capacity produces sufficient steam to generate 100,000 kilowatt hours of electrical power at no extra cost excepting capital investment for electrical equipment and loss of steam temperature passing through turbines. The process steam cost could be low since this steam could be derived from off-peak boiler capacity or from turbines in central electric stations. Fuel for steam and superheating would subsequently be reduced in cost. Advantages and disadvantages Compared to the Bergius process, the Karrick process is cheaper, requires less water and destroys less the thermal value (one-half that of the Bergius process). The smokeless semi-coke fuel, when burned in an open grate or in boilers, delivers 20% to 25% more heat than raw coal. The coal gas should deliver more heat than natural gas per heat unit contained due to the greater quantity of combined carbon and lower dilution of the combustion gases with water vapor.

(1706 or '07 in Shrewsbury, England ‚Äì 13 February 1789) was Fellow and Master of Pembroke College, Oxford.  Early years  He was born at Shrewsbury, of a Shropshire family, and was educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon (now Abingdon School)before he was entered into Pembroke College at the age of thirteen, where he took his master's degree, 18 April 1727, and obtained a fellowship. It has generally been reported, that he was afterwards tutor to the celebrated Dr. Samuel Johnson; but Dr. Adams very handsomely contradicted this report, by saying, that had Johnson returned to College after Jordan's (his tutor's) death, he might have been his tutor: \\"I was his nominal tutor, but he was above my mark.\\" A friendship, however, commenced between them, which lasted during the life of Dr. Johnson, to whose memory Dr. Adams did ample justice.  Curacy  Memorial to William Adams in Gloucester Cathedral In 1732, he was presented to the curacy, or, as usually called, the vicarage of St. Chad's in Shrewsbury, and on this occasion left the college. In 1756, he visited Oxford, and took his degrees of BD and D.D., and then went back to Shrewsbury, where he discharged the duties of his ministry with exemplary assiduity, patience, and affection; and contributed a very active part in the foundation of the Salop infirmary, and in promoting its success. The year before he went last to Oxford, he was presented to the rectory of Cound in Shropshire, by Mrs. Elizabeth Cressett of that place, and retained it during his life. In 1775, about 43 years after he left college, John Ratcliffe, master of Pembroke college, died; and although Dr. Adams had out-lived almost all his contemporaries, the gentlemen of the college came to a determination to elect him, a mark of respect due to his public character, and highly creditable to their discernment. He accordingly became master of Pembroke, 26 July 1775, and in consequence obtained a prebend of Gloucester, which is attached to that office. He now resigned the living of St. Chad, to the lasting regret of his hearers, as well as of the inhabitants at large, to whom he had long been endeared by his amiable character, and pious attention to the spiritual welfare of his flock. He was soon after made archdeacon of Llandaff. Over the college he presided with universal approbation, and engaged the affections of the students by his courteous demeanour and affability, mixed with the firmness necessary for the preservation of discipline. In his apartments here, he frequently cheered the latter days of his old friend Dr. Johnson, whom he survived but a few years; dying at his prebendal house at Gloucester, 13 January 1789, aged 82. He was interred in Gloucester Cathedral, where a monument was erected, with an inscription, which celebrates his ingenuity, learning, eloquence, piety, and benevolence. Dr. Adams married Miss Sarah Hunt, by whom he left a daughter, married, in 1788, to B. Hyatt, esq. of Painswick, in Gloucestershire, who died July 1810. Dr. Adams's first publications were three occasional sermons, printed 1741, 1742, 1749; but his principal work was an Essay on Hume's Essay on Miracles, 8vo, 1752; which was long considered as one of the ablest answers that appeared to David Hume's writings, and was distinguished for acuteness, elegance, and urbanity of style. Hume, whom he once met in London, acknowledged that he had treated him much better than he deserved. This work was followed by other occasional sermons, which the author collected into a volume, and published in 1777. Only one of these sermons involved him in a controversy. It was entitled \\"On true and false Doctrine,\\" preached at St. Chad's 4 September 1769, and touched upon some of the principles of the Methodists, in consequence of Dr. Adams having lent his pulpit to the Rev. William Romaine, who had there preached a sermon, the tendency of which Adams thought it his duty to counteract. This produced a series of pamphlets between the friends of the respective parties; but it is somewhat singular that neither Adams nor Mr. Romaine took any part in the controversy, nor did Mr. Romaine publish the sermon which had occasioned it. The dispute turned principally on the degree of Calvinism to be found in the Articles, &c.; of the Church of England.

Household  Fritz Brenner Fritz Brenner is an exceptionally talented SwissThe Red Box, chapter 15, Murder By The Book, chapter 7. cook who prepares and serves all of Wolfe's meals except those that Wolfe occasionally takes at Rusterman's Restaurant. Fritz also acts as the household's majordomo and butler. Fritz's living quarters are in the basement of Wolfe's brownstone; here he keeps 289 cookbooks, the head of a wild boar he shot in the Vosges, and busts of Escoffier and Brillat-Savarin as well as a cooking vessel thought to have been used by Julius Caesar's chef.The Doorbell Rang, chapter 7. Three years later, in The Father Hunt, chapter 16, the collection has grown to 294 cookbooks. A reference to a war wound in 1935's The League of Frightened Men implies that Fritz fought in World War I. Archie and Fritz have an easygoing working relationship, and Archie often spends time in the kitchen, as he puts it, \\"chinning\\" with Fritz. Fritz's relationship with Wolfe is one of mutual respect, admiration and devotion, excepting the times when they quarrel over a recipe. The notoriously finicky Wolfe has even gone so far as to refuse to eat one of Fritz's dishes when he used tarragon and saffron instead of sage to season starlings.The Golden Spiders, chapter 1. In Champagne for One it is noted that Fritz is very interested in Wolfe getting new clients, since the fees they pay Wolfe are the source from which Fritz's own salary is derived. Fritz can become anxious when a long time passes without a new paying client appearing. However, when the new client does arrive, Fritz is singularly uninterested in the details of the mystery, being supremely confident that Wolfe will solve it and duly collect his fee. When Archie is unavailable Fritz fields phone calls and follows Wolfe's instructions regarding callers at the front door, but his involvement in business is limited to taking messages (and serving drinks and snacks to clients in Wolfe's office). When Wolfe does not want his own and Archie's movements to be known, he arranges for Fritz to be able to claim truthfully that he does not know where they are or when they will return. In the Columbia Pictures feature film Meet Nero Wolfe (1936), the character of Fritz was transformed into a Scandinavian cook named Olaf, played by John Qualen. In the ABC-TV movie Nero Wolfe (1977), Fritz is portrayed by David Hurst. In the NBC TV series Nero Wolfe (1981), Fritz Brenner is played by George Voskovec. In the A&E; TV original series A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Fritz is played by Colin Fox. Theodore Horstmann Theodore Horstmann is an orchid expert who assists Wolfe in the plant rooms. His living quarters are adjacent to the plant rooms on the top floor of the brownstone (although in The Silent Speaker, Archie's commentary suggests that Theodore has separate living arrangements, noting that Wolfe is not letting Horstmann in on a complex deception he has orchestrated because he might accidentally let slip the truth outside the houseThe Silent Speaker, Chapter 32. \\"[B]esides, Theodore slept out, and while he was no traitor he might inadvertently spill it that his afflicted employer did not seem to be goofy among the orchids.). In the first Wolfe book, Fer-de-Lance, Archie remarks that he sometimes hears \\"old Horstmann\\" yelling at Wolfe, who \\"seemed to have the same effect on Horstmann that an umpire had on John J. McGraw,\\" though he is sure that Theodore does not dislike Wolfe.Fer-de-Lance, Chapter 3. \\"Sometimes I could hear old Horstmann, who tended the plants, yelling at him, while I was dressing or taking a bath. Wolfe seemed to have the same effect on Horstmann that an umpire had on John J. McGraw. Not that the old man really disliked Wolfe, I'm sure he didn't; I wouldn't wonder if he was worried for fear Wolfe's poundage, having at last reached the limit of equilibrium, would topple over and make hash of the orchids. Horstmann didn't think any more of those plants than I do of my right eye.\\" Horstmann seldom appears in person in the narratives. In \\"Door to Death\\", he provides a plot device, as his extended absence forces Wolfe to find another orchid tender. In \\"Black Orchids\\", though, Theodore's actions are central to the denouement, and in chapter five of The Second Confession, Wolfe becomes concerned for Theodore's safety after the plant rooms are badly damaged by gunfire. In spite of the great emphasis on food and eating throughout the series, little mention is made of where, when, or what Horstmann eats, except that in Plot It Yourself he is said to eat in the kitchen with Fritz. Theodore has a sister in New Jersey and sometimes spends his Sundays there. Theodore is portrayed by Robert Coote in the NBC TV series Nero Wolfe (1981). In the A&E; TV original series A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Theodore is an unseen character. He is regularly mentioned as being present in the brownstone, and Wolfe is seen speaking to him on the house phone on occasion, but the character himself is never seen or heard on screen. In one episode, Inspector Cramer demands to speak to him (but ultimately does not get to). The 'teers Saul Panzer, Fred Durkin, and Orrie Cather are collectively known as the 'teers, the three freelance detectives who make up the extended professional family. Though Wolfe hired a range of freelance operators, after the first few novels the 'teers were always Wolfe's first choices when extra manpower was needed. If only one extra detective was needed, Saul Panzer was the automatic first choice. \\"They were the three 'teers because once at a conference Orrie had said they were the three musketeers and we had tried to change it to fit,\\" Archie writes in The Father Hunt (1968, chapter 11). \\"We tried snoopeteers, privateers (for private eyes), dicketeers, wolfeteers, hawketeers, and others, and ended up by deciding that none of them was good enough and settling for the three 'teers.\\" Although he possesses a formidable memory, Archie begins chapter 7 of A Family Affair (1975) ‚Äî reporting a meeting of Saul, Fred, and Orrie in Wolfe's office ‚Äî by writing, \\"I forget who once called them the Three Musketeers.\\" Saul Panzer Saul Panzer is a top-notch private detective who is frequently hired by Wolfe either to assist Archie or to carry out assignments that Wolfe prefers that Archie not know about or for which Archie cannot be spared. Panzer is not an impressive-looking character; he dresses sloppily, has a big nose, and almost always needs a shave. Even so, Archie and Wolfe respect Saul immensely. He charges much higher fees than other New York detectives, but Archie insists that he is worth it. \\"With an office and a staff, he could have cleaned up,\\" Archie writes in chapter 6 of Champagne for One (1958), \\"but that wouldn't have left him enough time for playing the piano or playing pinochle or keeping up with his reading, so he preferred to free-lance at seventy bucks a day\\" ‚Äì equivalent to more than $600 today. Saul has an eidetic memory, which Archie frequently comments is better than his own, and an uncanny ability to connect people's names and identities permanently with their faces in his mind, even with only a glance. When a character in Too Many Women (1947, chapter 26) emphatically insists that Saul must have mistakenly identified someone else as her, Archie comments to Wolfe, \\"‚Ä¶ with Saul, you know how good that is. Even if she has a twin, it was her.\\" Wolfe emphatically agrees. Saul's marital status is one of the inconsistencies in the corpus. \\"He is himself a bachelor,\\" Wolfe tells Hilda Lindquist in The Rubber Band (1936, chapter 7). A change is indicated in the 1948 novella \\"Bullet for One\\" (chapter 7), when Wolfe asks Saul about his family.Stout, Rex, \\"Bullet for One\\". The American Magazine, July 1948, page 153 In \\"Door to Death\\" (1949, chapter 7), Archie leaves a phone message with Saul's wife in Brooklyn. Saul has a wife and children in Brooklyn in The Second Confession (1949, chapter 5); he has a wife and children in In the Best Families (1950, chapter 14). No mention is made of Saul's wife or children after 1950, though, and readers are left to decide whether the marriage ended, or Saul's family was simply retconned out of existence. In \\"The Next Witness\\", first published in May 1955, Saul has an apartment in Manhattan to himself. He lives alone on the fifth (top) floor of a remodeled house on 38th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues. In chapter 4, Archie describes Saul's living room, which Wolfe deems \\"a good room\\" when he sees it for the first time: > It was a big room, lighted with two floor lamps and two table lamps. One > wall had windows, another was solid with books, and the other two had > pictures and shelves that were cluttered with everything from chunks of > minerals to walrus tusks. In the far corner was a grand piano.Stout, Rex, > \\"The Last Witness\\". The American Magazine, May 1955, page 133. The role of Saul Panzer is played by George Wyner in the NBC TV series Nero Wolfe (1981); by Saul Rubinek in the A&E; original film The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2000); and by Conrad Dunn in the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002). Fred Durkin Fred Durkin is a blue-collar investigator who is often hired for mundane tasks such as surveillance. In his earliest appearances, Archie is very dismissive of Durkin, calling him \\"dumb\\". However, over the course of the series, Archie comes to appreciate Fred more; though not prone to flashes of insight, Fred Durkin is reliably hard-working and stubborn about getting details right. In the novella \\"Kill Now‚ÄîPay Later, Archie opines that Fred \\"wasn't in Saul's class but was way above average.\\"Kill Now‚ÄîPay Later, Chapter 8 (p.59, Bantam Books edition) Married with several children, Fred is honest and likable, but unsophisticated. He is often nervous around Wolfe, whom he once offended by stirring vinegar into a roux for squab at Wolfe's table.Where There's a Will, chapter 5, and cited in chapter 10 of The Nero Wolfe Cookbook. To curry favor with Wolfe, he sometimes accepts Wolfe's offer of beer, though Archie has heard Fred call beer \\"slop\\".The Second Confession, Chapter 16 (p. 170, Viking edition). In later works, Archie Goodwin notes that Fred is \\"worth at least half as much as Saul ‚Äì which was his price,\\"Champagne for One, chapter VI. and also approvingly notes that, unlike some other detectives, Fred knows his limitations and works extremely well within them. Likewise, in The Golden Spiders, Wolfe is willing to disburse more than twice as much expense money to Fred than to Orrie and Saul, remarking that Fred never goes over budget when given cash. In the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002) and the series pilot, The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2000), the role of Fred Durkin is played by Fulvio Cecere. Orrie Cather Orrie Cather is a handsome, personable detective, someone people want to tell things ‚Äî but he can be too full of himself. In The Mother Hunt (chapter 9), after Wolfe leaves it to Saul to teach Orrie better manners, Archie warns Wolfe, \\"You know, if you pile it on enough to give Orrie an inferiority complex, it will be a lulu, and a damn good op will be ruined.\\" But Archie, too, has an occasional run-in with Orrie, who thinks he would look just fine sitting at Archie's desk. Orrie's talents as a professional operative are much narrower than Archie's. He has neither Saul Panzer's genius for tailing, nor Fred Durkin's bulldog tenacity, and is more willing than the others to take less-than-legal shortcuts. He is more than competent, and Stout furnishes him more complex motives than he does Saul or Fred. Ambiguities in Orrie's character are introduced as early as The League of Frightened Men (1935); . In 1966's Death of a Doxy, in which he is accused of murder, the state of his character forces Wolfe and his associate to debate whether or not he is capable of the crime; Wolfe himself states \\"You must know that I have no affection for him.\\"Death of a Doxy, chapter 3 In Champagne for One Orrie pulls a major coup, breaking into a suspect's apartment and finding a key document on which the solution of the book's mystery largely hinges ‚Äì a document which he insists upon handing to Wolfe personally rather than through Goodwin (who reluctantly admits that that was Orrie's due). Orrie also plays a key role in the last Nero Wolfe novel, A Family Affair. Orrie's full first name is one of the inconsistencies in the corpus. In chapter 16 of The Golden Spiders (1953), clothing store owner Bernard Levine states that he was shown \\"a New York detective license with his picture on it and his name, Orvald Cather.\\" In chapter 3 of If Death Ever Slept, Archie calls the office and Orrie answers the phone, \\"Nero Wolfe's residence. Orville Cather speaking.\\" And, thinking he was clarifying the matter, Rex Stout's biographer John McAleer asked the author, \\"Is Orrie Cather's given name Orrin?\\" \\"Probably,\\" Stout replied.McAleer, John J., Royal Decree: Conversations with Rex Stout. Ashton, Maryland: Pontes Press, 1983, page 49 In the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002) and the series pilot, The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2000), the role of Orrie Cather is played by Trent McMullen. Law enforcement officials \\"I am much kinder to the police than most writers of detective stories,\\" Rex Stout said. \\"My two main police characters, Cramer and Stebbins, are neither stupid nor brutal, and, judging from letters I get from readers, they are likable.\\" Inspector Cramer Inspector Cramer, head of the New York Police Department's Homicide Division, is Wolfe's main foil. Cramer collaborates with Wolfe in the majority of the novels and short stories, but resents the high- handed manner in which Wolfe pursues his investigations ‚Äî particularly Wolfe's tendency to manipulate murderers into committing suicide rather than allowing them to face trial.For example, Fer-de-Lance, The Red Box, Some Buried Caesar, \\"Booby Trap,\\" Too Many Women, \\"Instead of Evidence\\", Too Many Clients, Gambit, \\"Murder Is Corny,\\" Death of a Doxy, and A Family Affair. Cramer is usually assisted by Sergeant Purley Stebbins, and at times by Lt. George Rowcliff, Archie's personal nemesis. Wolfe and Archie collaborate with Cramer on his homicide cases, but the relationship is a contentious one. Wolfe regularly and deliberately withholds information from Cramer to ensure that Wolfe, rather than the police, will solve a case. In return, Cramer has enjoyed twitting Wolfe by rising from the red leather chair without using his arms for leverage ‚Äì something that Wolfe cannot do.The Golden Spiders, chapter 3. Archie remarks that when Cramer is with Wolfe, \\"... he always made a point of getting upright from a chair with the leverage of his leg muscles only, because Wolfe used hands and arms.\\" Nearly every novel that involves Cramer shows him calling on Wolfe in a barely suppressed rage, demanding the information he is sure -- sometimes quite rightly -- that Wolfe is withholding. Despite their argumentative relationship, Cramer has considerable respect for Wolfe's investigative skill. In The Doorbell Rang, Cramer goes to some lengths to keep the state of New York from taking Wolfe and Archie's licenses as private investigators, and in In the Best Families, Cramer says, \\"Wolfe is too cocky to live ... I would love to bloody his nose for him. I've tried to often enough, and someday I will and enjoy it. But I would hate to see him break his neck on a deal like this where he hasn't got a chance.\\"In the Best Families, Chapter 9. Cramer is also grateful to Wolfe for saving his job in The Silent Speaker, and at the end of that book,Chapter 35. Cramer expresses his gratitude by bringing Wolfe \\" ... a misshapen object covered with green florist's paper\\" that turns out to be an orchid. In return, Wolfe holds the inspector in high regard, admiring his tenacity and preferring to deal with him than any other member of the police force. For example, speaking of Cramer, Wolfe says, \\"By luck I had made a hole in the wall and I've let him through, and if you knew him as I do you would realize that he can't be chased out again.\\"Over My Dead Body, Chapter 18. Cramer is aware that Wolfe appreciates the Homicide Division's capabilities: \\"As conceited as you are, Wolfe, you told me once that I am better equipped to handle nine murder cases out of ten than you are.\\"The Red Box, Chapter 5. Cramer shares few, if any, of Wolfe's tastes; in the story \\"Black Orchids\\", for example, Wolfe exclaims that the black orchids are unique, matchless, and incomparable, Cramer replies, \\"They're pretty ... Kind of drab, though. Not much color. I like geraniums better.\\"Chapter 10. One taste that Cramer does share with Wolfe is that he appears to enjoy a good beer. Wolfe often offers him one, except when the visit is particularly contentious. Cramer almost always declines, claiming not to have the time. But on the occasion that he accepts, he appears to actually enjoy the less formal chat with Wolfe over a beer. Cramer is a cigar chewer. In early Nero Wolfe novels, Cramer lights and smokes them (in The League of Frightened Men he smokes a pipe), but in later novels, Archie notes that Cramer only chews on cigars and has never been known to light one. Cramer often ends his visits to Wolfe's office by angrily throwing his chewed cigar at the wastebasket, usually missing the target. Archie suspects that the cigars give Cramer a moment to calm down before he says something regrettable.For example, \\"Death of a Demon\\", chapter 3. Cramer is married and has one son, who fights in the Australian theater during World War II.\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\", beginning of Chap. 9 (Farrar & Rinehart, War Edition). Archie has just given his report about Ann Amory to Wolfe and Cramer, and Cramer says, \\"I had a headache and now it's worse. My son's in Australia with the Air Corps. He's a bombardier.\\" Cramer's first name is given once only, as Fergus, in 1940's Where There's a Will (chapter 17). However, his initials are later given as \\"L.T.C.\\" in 1946's The Silent Speaker, due to Stout's failure to recall that he had earlier given Cramer a first name.As told to John McAleer in Royal Decree: Conversations with Rex Stout, p. 60. Stout blames \\"laziness. I didn't bother to check on whether he already had a first name. Of course, all discrepancies in the Nero Wolfe stories are Archie Goodwin's fault.\\" This led to Robert Goldsborough giving him the full name of \\"Lionel T. Cramer\\" in Goldsborough's version of Nero Wolfe novels. \\"To me he is just Inspector Cramer,\\" Stout said.McAleer, John, Rex Stout: A Biography, p. 557 Cramer is the protagonist of one Stout novel, Red Threads (1939). Inspector Cramer was portrayed by Biff McGuire in the 1977 TV movie Nero Wolfe, by Allan Miller in NBC TV's 1981 series, and by Sergey Parshin in Russian TV-series Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin (2001-2002). In the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002), the role of Inspector Cramer is played by Bill Smitrovich. Archie hears him called Fergus in the episode \\"The Silent Speaker\\", when he makes the brief acquaintance of Mrs. Cramer. Sergeant Purley Stebbins Sergeant Purley Stebbins is Inspector Cramer's assistant. Stebbins is in many ways the archetypal good cop: tough, brave, and dedicated, but also gruff and unpolished. Stebbins is ambivalent about Archie, and Archie makes frequent references to the few times Stebbins has let his guard down and called him by his first name. Archie believes that Stebbins harbors some resentment toward him due to the great discrepancy in their salaries,Prisoner's Base, chapter 14. but Stebbins recognizes Archie as an expert and talented detective. In Champagne for One, Stebbins' keen observation of the behavior of a group of murder suspects earns a comment of admiration from Wolfe. He also appears in the Alphabet Hicks short story \\"By His Own Hand (Curtain Line)\\" published in April 1955. In the A&E; TV series, the role of Purley Stebbins is played by R.D. Reid. Lieutenant Rowcliff Lieutenant George Rowcliff is a police lieutenant for whom Wolfe harbors special animus, partly due to an incident in which Rowcliff took Wolfe into custody. As Wolfe once put it, \\"This whole performance is based on an idiotic assumption, which was natural and indeed inevitable, since Mr. Rowcliff is your champion ass ‚Äì the assumption that Mr. Goodwin and I are both cretins.\\"Nero Wolfe addressing Inspector Cramer, DA Bowen and Lt. Rowcliff in Prisoner's Base (1952) As noted above, Rowcliff starts to stutter when he is sufficiently angry or frustrated; Archie sometimes makes a private game of seeing how quickly he can bring Rowcliff to this point, and occasionally affects the stutter to goad him into it. As with Cramer, Stout made a continuity error in Rowcliff's first name. Though it is given as George elsewhere, in Please Pass the Guilt, his first two initials are stated as \\"J.M.\\" in a letter dictated by Wolfe. There is also inconsistency in the spelling of the lieutenant's surname; it occasionally appears as \\"Rowcliffe.\\" (This variant is the version that appears in The Silent Speaker, the same novel in which the continuity error regarding Cramer's first name is introduced.) Rowcliff is the only character acknowledged by Stout to have been consciously modeled and named after a real-life person ‚Äî a young naval attache under whom Stout served while a yeoman on Theodore Roosevelt's presidential yacht Mayflower in 1906‚Äì07 and to whom Stout took an intense and enduring dislike. Whether or not the connection between the real and fictional Rowcliffs was known contemporaneously, clearly the source of Stout‚Äôs obnoxious cop suffered no ill effects professionally: Gilbert Jonathan Rowcliff went on to a distinguished naval career spanning both world wars, at sea as an honored commander and in Washington as judge advocate general, a position he assumed in June 1936, shortly after his namesake was introduced in The Rubber Band. Also, whether or not the naval Rowcliff followed Stout‚Äôs career or read and recognized himself in the Nero Wolfe books, Stout clearly followed his; in an interview with John McAleer, the author dead-panned, ‚Äúhe retired in December 1945, with the rank of rear admiral.‚ÄùAs told to John McAleer in Royal Decree, p. 52. McAleer: \\"You've said you never modeled a character on anyone you know, but isn't Lieutenant Rowcliff modeled on an officer you served under on the presidential yacht?\\" Stout: \\"Yes. Gilbert Jonathan Rowcliff, who was Roosevelt's naval aide. He was an invariable stinker.\\" The role of Rowcliff is played by Bill MacDonald in the A&E; TV series.

Lon is Archie's pipeline to breaking crime news, and Archie frequently asks Lon for background information on current or prospective clients. Archie, Lon, and some other Wolfe regulars play poker Thursday nights at Saul Panzer's apartment. Over the years, Wolfe and the Gazette develop a symbiotic relationship that gives the newspaper exclusive information regarding Wolfe's cases, and that gives Wolfe publicity ‚Äì sometimes more than he would want. Lon Cohen first appeared in the 1946 novel, The Silent Speaker (chapter 8). Prior to that, the detectives used other contacts from the Gazette, such as Harry Foster in Fer-de-Lance. In The Second Confession (chapter 19), Archie says Lon had risen to \\"second in command at the Gazette's city desk,\\" and by A Right to Die (chapter 5) he is \\"confidential assistant to the publisher of the Gazette.\\" Lon's role at the New York Gazette is not further detailed in the Rex Stout stories, and in fact, in later books Archie explicitly states that he is not entirely sure what Lon's exact job entails. Lon's actual job duties later become central to the story line in Robert Goldsborough's novel Death on Deadline. In the 1977 TV movie Nero Wolfe, Lon Cohen is played by John Randolph. In the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002), Lon Cohen is played by Saul Rubinek. Lily Rowan Lily sees the red bull with Clyde Osgood's body in Some Buried Caesar (chapter 4) Lily Rowan, heiress and socialite, often appears as Archie Goodwin's romantic companion, although the relationship is not an exclusive one. Lily and Archie meet in Some Buried Caesar, in which she calls him \\"Escamillo\\"Some Buried Caesar, chapter 1. after his near-encounters with a pastured bull. Subsequently, she appears in several stories (and is mentioned in passing in others) and provides needed assistance on occasion (see, particularly, In the Best Families and A Right to Die). Lily is one of the few women for whom Nero Wolfe has a grudging respect: \\"I have not only eaten her bread and salt, I have eaten her grouse. I am in her debt.\\"The Rodeo Murder, Chapter 3. Lily's father, who made his money building New York's sewer system and was a power in Tammany Hall, helped Inspector Cramer get started at the NYPD; this background connection with Cramer surfaces in one of the early stories, \\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\", when Cramer expresses discomfort about dealing with Lily as a murder suspect, but does not come up again in the series. In three episodes of the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002) ‚Äî \\"Door to Death\\", \\"Christmas Party\\" and \\"Death of a Doxy\\" ‚Äî the role of Lily Rowan is played by Kari Matchett. Others * Marko Vukƒçiƒá ‚Äî A fellow Montenegrin whom Wolfe has known since childhood. Marko owns the upscale Rusterman's Restaurant in Manhattan. In later novels, Wolfe acts as the restaurant's trustee following Marko's murder in The Black Mountain. * Lewis Hewitt ‚Äî Well-heeled orchid fancier, whom Wolfe saved from notoriety (as told in \\"Black Orchids\\"). During a prolonged absence, Wolfe arranges for his orchids to be cared for at Hewitt's estate. Hewitt is a member of the Ten for Aristology, a group of gourmets that figures in \\"Poison √† la Carte\\" and The Doorbell Rang. In the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery the role of Hewitt is played by David Hemblen. * Nathaniel Parker ‚Äî Wolfe's lawyer (and occasionally a client's lawyer, on Wolfe's recommendation) when only a lawyer will do. Parker succeeded Henry H. Barber, who played this role earlier in the series. On the way from Henry Barber to Nathaniel Parker, Wolfe consults Henry Parker in chapter 9 of The Golden Spiders. Parker is well educated: for example, Parker converses with Wolfe in French during the story \\"Immune to Murder\\". In the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Parker was played by Hrant Alianak in \\"Prisoner's Base,\\" and by George Plimpton in \\"Death of a Doxy\\" and \\"Murder is Corny.\\" * Edwin A. \\"Doc\\" Vollmer ‚Äî A medical doctor who is Wolfe's neighbor and occasional confidante. In the novel The Silent Speaker, Vollmer certifies an illness severe enough that Wolfe cannot be interrogated by the police. In the novel Please Pass the Guilt, Wolfe and Goodwin become involved in a murder case by doing a favor for Vollmer and his friend Irwin Ostrow, who runs a crisis intervention center. In the A&E; television series A Nero Wolfe Mystery Vollmer was played by Ken Kramer in \\"The Doorbell Rang\\" and \\"Disguise for Murder,\\" and by Joe Flaherty in \\"The Silent Speaker.\\" * Carla Lovchen ‚Äî Wolfe's adopted daughter, who appears in two stories, Over My Dead Body and The Black Mountain. Her murder in The Black Mountain, as well as that of Marko Vukƒçiƒá, prompts Wolfe to leave the country for the only time in the series and return to Montenegro. In the A&E; television series A Nero Wolfe Mystery Carla Lovchen was played by Kari Matchett in the concluding episode of the first season, \\"Over My Dead Body.\\" * Felix Courbet ‚Äî Part owner and manager of Rusterman's Restaurant following the death of Marko Vukƒçiƒá. Felix plays a major role in both \\"Poison √† la Carte\\" and A Family Affair, in which his surname is changed to Mauer. In The Black Mountain his surname is Martin. In the adaptation of \\"Poison √† la Carte\\" for the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery Felix is played by Carlo Rota. Freelance operatives The three 'teers were always Wolfe's first choice when hiring extra manpower for a job. In certain specialized cases where a man would be unsuitable for the particular assignment, two female detectives are sometimes called upon: Dol Bonner Theodolinda \\"Dol\\" Bonner is a smart, attractive female private detective, introduced as the protagonist of Rex Stout's 1937 novel The Hand in the Glove. Head of her own detective agency, she makes another appearance in Stout's Tecumseh Fox novel Bad for Business (1940). Dol plays a major role in the Nero Wolfe novella \\"Too Many Detectives\\", and she is employed by Wolfe in If Death Ever Slept and Plot It Yourself. In Lady Against the Odds, a 1992 TV adaptation of The Hand in the Glove, Dol Bonner is played by Crystal Bernard. Sally Corbett Wolfe and Archie first meet Dol Bonner's assistant Sally Corbett (aka Sally Colt) in the first chapter of \\"Too Many Detectives\\", when they are summoned to Albany for questioning about wiretapping activities. Archie starts his report by stating, \\"I am against female detectives on principle.\\" Still Sally Colt, she is again called on to help out in If Death Ever Slept. In Plot It Yourself, it is a Sally Corbett, not Colt, who helps out on Wolfe's case: \\"Sally Corbett was one of the two women who, a couple of years back, had made me feel that there might be some flaw in my attitude toward female dicks,\\" Archie writes. Sally Colt/Corbett makes a final appearance in The Mother Hunt, in which Archie again remarks that Sally and Dol had made him change his attitude about female detectives.If Death Ever Slept, chapter 17; Plot It Yourself, chapter 19; The Mother Hunt, chapter 12. Sally Corbett is played by Manon von Gerkan in Motherhunt, part of the second season of the A&E; original series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2001‚Äì2002). Others Wolfe generally only called on these operatives in cases where manpower beyond the three 'teers was needed, or when one of the 'teers was unavailable, or when certain specialized talents were required. * Bill Gore ‚Äî Freelance operative occasionally called in when Wolfe requires additional help in the field. Very early on, in The League Of Frightened Men, Bill is actually third on the list of operatives Wolfe calls upon -- behind Saul and Fred but ahead of Orrie Cather. Big, muscular and not especially bright, Bill's chief attributes are his size, stamina and determination. As well, having decided that Archie is a funny guy, he laughs at all Archie's quips and comments, even if he doesn't understand them. Despite Wolfe's apparent early approval of Bill, he is infrequently seen and makes his last appearance in 1955's Before Midnight, although he is mentioned in passing in at least one later Stout story. He is glimpsed again in some of Goldsborough's books more than 30 years after his previous appearance. * Johnny Keems ‚Äî Freelance operative occasionally called in by Wolfe. Flashy, and prone to showboating, Johnny is generally reliable if given specific instructions. He makes his last appearance in the novel Might as Well Be Dead, where he is killed by a hit-and-run driver. Johnny, like Orrie, is said by Archie to covet his (Archie's) job. * Del Bascom ‚Äî Independent investigator who runs a large detective agency in Manhattan. Wolfe sometimes subcontracts to Bascom when he needs more operatives than usual (The Silent Speaker, for example). * Herb Aronson and Al Goller ‚Äî Cabdrivers hired by Archie for mobile surveillance work. * Ethelbert (or \\"Geoffrey\\") Hitchcock ‚Äî Wolfe's contact in London who handles inquiries to be made in Europe. Arnold Zeck Arnold Zeck appears in three Nero Wolfe novels. Zeck is a mysterious and powerful crime boss possessed of a superior intellect. He and Wolfe become mutual admirers and antagonists in the course of several cases; when he is first mentioned in And Be a Villain, Archie indicates that he became aware of Zeck following a telephone call to Wolfe made several months before the events of the novel during an unreported case, but Wolfe has warned him not to investigate any further and to do his best to forget that the criminal exists. Wolfe summarises his activities and tactics in The Second Confession (1949) as follows: \\"He has varied and extensive sources of income. All of them are illegal and some of them are morally repulsive. Narcotics, smuggling, industrial and commercial rackets, gambling, waterfront blackguardism, professional larceny, blackmailing, political malfeasance ‚Äì that by no means exhausts his curriculum, but it sufficiently indicates his character. He has, up to now, triumphantly kept himself invulnerable by having the perspicacity to see that a criminal practising on a large scale over a wide area and a long period of time can get impunity only by maintaining a gap between his person and his crimes which cannot be bridged; and by having unexcelled talent, a remorseless purpose and a will that cannot be dented or deflected.\\"The Second Confession, Chapter 7. Wolfe considers Zeck the most dangerous criminal he has encountered in his career and informs Archie that any direct conflict between them would by necessity become a battle to the death, intimating that he would be compelled to abandon the brownstone and work to destroy Zeck utterly if such circumstances arose. Zeck‚Äôs malevolent presence intrudes via telephone in two novels, And Be a Villain (1948) and The Second Confession (1949). In the latter, he sends gunmen to fire on Wolfe's orchid rooms in an attempt to dissuade Wolfe from investigating a case that could lead back to him. Zeck had previously telephoned Wolfe twice: on June 9, 1943, concerning Wolfe‚Äôs work for General Carpenter; and on January 16, 1946, regarding Mrs. Tremont.And Be a Villain, Chapter 15. Zeck himself appears in In the Best Families (1950), the third book of what is popularly called The Zeck Trilogy, in which Nero Wolfe finds it necessary to defeat Zeck once and for all. In 1974, the Viking Press collected the three Zeck novels in an omnibus volume, Triple Zeck, and in 2016, Random House issued an e-book set of the three books titled The Zeck Trilogy. \\"I was thrilled when Wolfe finally encountered his own Moriarty in the archvillain Arnold Zeck,\\" wrote Michael Dirda, Pulitzer Prize-winning book critic for The Washington Post.Dirda, Michael. An Open Book (page 122). W.W. Norton & Company, 2004. British author and literary critic David Langford and others have compared that the relationship between Zeck and Wolfe to that of Professor Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes.Langford, David. A Stout Fellow ... on Nero Wolfe. Million Magazine, 1992. Langford calls \\"the dread and highly respectable mastermind Arnold Zeck ‚Ä¶ Stout's equivalent of Professor Moriarty.\\" The role of Arnold Zeck (renamed Arnold Dorso) is played by Robert Loggia in \\"In the Best Families\\", an episode of the 1981 NBC TV series Nero Wolfe.

The cards were inserted into packs of \\"Hassan Cork Tip Cigarettes\\". Several characteristics make this vintage card a standout amongst other forms of tobacco advertising of the time and lend to its value as a highly sought-after collectible.1912 T202 Hassan Triple Folder on Card Board Connection This set was a step further in comparison with another American Tobacco release, the T201 set of 1911, that had featured two players on the same card.  Overview  The cards were quite large in comparison to the T205 (1911) and T206 (1909 to 1911) cards from the same time period. The T202 was designed as a triptych or as it is referred to in the baseball card collecting hobby a triple folder. Each of the end panels displayed an individual player in color, while the center panel contained a black-and-white photo of \\"live action\\" baseball players. To insert the card into packs of cigarettes the two end panels were folded over the center panel. When the card is fully extended it measures 5\\" wide by 2\\" high. Example of a T202 card, featuring two players on borders (in this case, H. Chase and H. Wolter) and a \\"live action\\" scene on the middle The T202 set consisted of 132 total cards with numerous combinations of end panels and center panels. Prominent players of the time who appearedd on the most end and center panel combinations were Christy Mathewson, who appeared on ten different cards all on end panels, and Ty Cobb, who appeared on a combination of over six different cards including end and center panels. Card backs include biographies for the players and a text describing the live-action scene on the middle. All of those text also featured a Hassan Cigarettes advertising below. Some of the players featured on the end panels also appeared on the middle action, but not always. Both leagues, American and National, also featured different card designs. Value According to several recent sales on Ebay, the common T202 that is rated a PSA 5 or better will cost at least $100. Cards that have at least one Hall of Fame player highlighted in any of the three pictures, that are rated a PSA 5 or better will cost at least $150. Some Hall of Famers command higher prices than others, but Ty Cobb generally commands the most money. A Cobb in PSA 5 condition will cost at least $1500 as of 2019. There is an unusual rarity in this set, however. The Lord Catches His Man card, previously considered a common card worth around $100, has dramatically increased in price, due to the speculation that the center picture of the card may be Shoeless Joe Jackson. The theory seems to be backed up by a photo taken in a newspaper from the same year the card came out. The photo and the card appear to match. If the center panel is, in fact, Shoeless Joe Jackson, it will most likely easily be the most valuable card in the set, as he does not appear in any other card.

Cleven Photo The Spruce Lake Protected Area, was a 71,347-hectare Protected Area in the British Columbia provincial parks system 200 km north of Vancouver. The area had been the subject of an ongoing preservationist controversy since the 1930s. Formerly known variously as the Southern Chilcotin Mountains Provincial Park, Southern Chilcotins, and also as South Chilcotin Provincial Park. In 2007, its status as a provincial park was downgraded to protected area. Recreational activities included camping, hiking, cycling, swimming, fishing and hunting. There were walk-in wilderness camping sites. Wildlife in the protected area include grizzly bear, California bighorn sheep and wolverine.Spruce Lake Protected Area main page. BC Parks of British Columbia In June 2010, Bill 15 - created the South Chilcotin Mountains Park, a \\"Class A\\" park of 56,796 hectares from Spruce Lake Protected Area. The remaining approximately 14,550 hectares were set aside for tourism and mining, but commercial logging is still prohibited. The bill also confirmed the implementation of the 2004 decision for mining/tourism zones in the Lillooet Land and Resource Management Plan area.Online text of Bill 15-\\"South Chilcotin Mountains Park\\". 2010 Legislative Assembly of British ColumbiaNew release BC Ministry of Environment Background The area was designated as a protected area by the British Columbia provincial government in 2001, and then established as a Provincial Park by then Minister of Water, Land and Air Protection Minister Joyce Murray in 2004, with park boundaries including 70% of the protected area and limited resource extraction allowed in the remaining area on the protected area's periphery. The protected area designation resulted from the Lillooet Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP), in which local communities, environmental, recreation and resource interests were attempted to be addressed. Even though it is not in the Chilcotin District proper, the area has been called the \\"South Chilcotins\\" since about 1980 when a group of conservationists started to promote the area for protection as a park. The South Chilcotin name is derived from its geographic position in the Chilcotin Ranges, into the Bridge River Country where the park is located. Bert Brink, one of British Columbia's most renowned naturalist, advocated for the conservation of this area for over sixty years and lived to see it become a park, before he died in 2007. Location and topography The protected area was located on the inland lea of the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains, on the north flank of the Bridge River Country and the Chilcotin Country to the north. It adjoined Big Creek Provincial Park and Ts'il?os Provincial Park, which border it on the north and northwest, respectively. Part of the larger subrange of the Pacific Ranges known as the Chilcotin Ranges, the area was partially protected in the 1990s after 60 years of debate and controversy. Controversy It was the object of a protracted quarrel between preservationists and resource development which first began in the 1930s when prospectors and guide-outfitters dedicated to its natural beauty proposed it for preservation status. Charlie Cunningham, whose career as a wildlife film- maker began in this area, was a driving force in the original movement for preservation. The Charlie Cunningham Wilderness proposal was revised in the 1970s as the Spruce Lake-Eldorado park proposal, and also as the Spruce Lake Management Planning Unit, but as land-use plans impinged on the proposed park area these names were abandoned. The area's unique and distinct landscape and ecology, different from the rest of the Chilcotin Ranges or the rest of the Bridge River Country, was what made it stand out for protection amid a region already wild and extremely beautiful before logging and hydroelectric development transformed the valley to the south. Many environmentalist hope that the creation of Ts'ilos and Big Creek Provincial Parks will help shore up the protection of the South Chilcotin Provincial Park which remained vulnerable to government review. Hunting guide Ted (Chilco) Choate of Gaspard Lake, on the Chilcotin Plateau has joined in the call to combine all three parks, plus the Churn Creek Protected Area to the northeast, plus some of the surrounding country and the deep, much higher heart of the Pacific Ranges into a National Park. Industry and government remain publicly committed to shared use and sustainable planning.  First Nations History Historically this region was the hunting territory of Chief Hunter Jack of the Lakes Lillooet, whose big-game hunting business shared the region with hunters of the Tsilhqot'in people. The shared use of the area north of the Bridge River and Gun Creek was part of the settlement of an early 19th-century peace which had ended a long and bloody war between Hunter Jack's people and the Tsilhqot'in. Trails from the Bridge River Country led over the region to Taseko Lake and Chilko Lake in the Chilcotin Country, and also east across the Camelsfoot Range to the Fraser River near Big Bar.

Born in Canning Town, east London, and subsequently moving to Finchley in his teens, Oates trained as a heating engineer for his father's firm, before becoming an actor. He was in the Intelligence Corps during his Army National Service. Working in theatrical rep during the 1950s he was leading man at York Theatre Royal for some years, before getting a big break in television in the science fiction series Doomwatch as Dr. John Ridge, for which he is perhaps best known. (Co-stars included John Paul as Dr. Spencer Quist and Robert Powell as Toby Wren). He appeared regularly as Anthony Kelly in the 1960s espionage series The Mask of Janus and its spin-off series The Spies. His many guest appearances included: The Avengers, Man in a Suitcase, Department S, Jason King, The New Avengers, The Professionals, Bergerac and The 10 Percenters. His film appearances were few but included Night Train to Paris (1964), the British sci-fi film The Terrornauts (1967), and the film version of Doomwatch (1972). He appeared as John Steed in the 1971 stage adaptation of The Avengers with Sue Lloyd and Kate O'Mara. He also appeared in the West End in the Francis Durbridge thriller Suddenly at Home. He worked extensively in theatre in Great Britain, the West End and indeed, the world throughout his career, both as an actor and a director, and lived in Canada for some time where he had a touring theatre company. His son, Justin Brett, also an actor, said that his father was offered the role of James Bond in Diamonds Are Forever, but that Sean Connery changed his mind and returned to the role. Other sources suggest that Oates was in the running before Roger Moore was confirmed as 007 for Live and Let Die. In tandem with his straight acting career, Simon also appeared many times as a stand-up comic and compere, working with such stars as Tom Jones, Sandie Shaw and the Who. He also appeared at the London Palladium with Dorothy Squires. He directed Woman in a Dressing Gown, starring Brenda Bruce at the Vaudeville Theatre. He also directed many musicals and straight plays on the touring circuit. Simon died on Wednesday 20 May 2009, following protracted illness, and is survived by his wife, Jaki, and three children.

According to the resolution adopting the flag, the blue stands for the courage and conviction of the city's leaders throughout history, while the gold denotes the richness of city's land and resources. The flag was adopted in December 1963 when the governments of Nashville and Davidson County merged to form the Metro government. In an official ceremony, it was reigned in as the new flag on August 4, 1964, at the Metropolitan Courthouse. The flag is modeled after the Tennessee state flag. History The seal displays a Native American holding a skull standing by a tobacco plant, an eagle, and a badge-shaped shield decorated in a style similar to the American flag. The Native is said to be a representative of the \\"Woodland\\" culture contemplating the skull of a member of an earlier Native culture such as the Mound Builders. Though the de jure version of the flag included a monochromatic seal, today flags in Nashville are displayed with the seal in full color. Additionally, there is usually a thin white bar separating the outer strip of yellow from the blue field. Prior to the consolidation, the flag consisted of a blue star on a red background overlapped by two crossing white bars. The blue star was enclosed in golden olive branches located under the letter N, standing for the city name. It had been designed by Harville H. Duncan and adopted by the City Council in 1961. In a review by the North American Vexillological Association of 150 U.S. city flags, the Nashvillian flag came in 43rd with a rating of 4.85 out of 10.NAVA's city flag survey The group cited Nashville's use of its city seal, which they said makes flags difficult to discern from a distance. They also stated that the gold outer stripe would not have much functionality, because flags tend to fray, and the outer edge occasionally needs shaving. Mayor Bill Purcell commented, \\"Flags are a subjective thing. People in the rest of the country may not appreciate our unique flag. It's a flag that takes some time to get comfortable with. There are not many flags with a skull on it.\\"Schrade, Brad (28 November 2004). \\"What's in a flag? Nashville's gets mediocre marks\\", The Tennessean.

Early history The factory in Sv√§ngsta where there still is production. Photo taken from the north. AB Urfabriken began at a factory located near the M√∂rrum River, in Blekinge, Sweden. The company, founded in 1921, originally manufactured watches, telephone timers and taximeters. However, the founder's son, G√∂te Borgstr√∂m, a fishing enthusiast, soon redirected its focus towards fishing reels during World War II, when demand for those products diminished. The leading outdoor sports participant distributing and manufacturing firm Garcia Corporation (1947 to 1978) was the largest fishing tackle company of its time, formerly known under the earlier name Charles Garcia & Company New York City. The Garcia Corporation started importing and marketing ABU's many reels in the 1950s, including the famous Ambassadeur reels. Garcia was already involved in the importing, marketing and distributing of the Mitchell 300 spinning reel from France since 1947. The Garcia Tackle Company of 1979 to 1980 was a short lived partnership between ABU and Mitchell S.A. of France, and in 1980, ABU AB acquired the New Jersey based Garcia Tackle Company, and changed their name to Abu Garcia. Mitchell S.A. would go their own way, but the two brands would join together again under the Pure Fishing banner, only again to be sold to the Jarden Corporation in April 2007. In December 2015, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Jarden Corporation. In November 2018, Newell sold Pure Fishing to Sycamore Partners. Modern developments Swedish royal coat of arms, a right conferred by Royal Warrant, can be seen clearly ABU Garcia introduced a series of fishing reels and related products in the beginning of the 1950s. The Swedish built ABU 444, the company's first spinning reel, was introduced in 1955, followed in 1965 by the first model of the Cardinal series of spinning reels. Beginning in 1957, the company also became known for its advanced spin cast reels (Abumatic) featuring several engineering innovations such as level wind mechanisms (oscillating spools), under rod spin cast reel designs (the Abu 500 series) and improved drags for fighting larger gamefish. The famous Ambassadeur series of bait casting reels, which utilized advanced metal alloys, ball bearing friction interfaces, and precisely cut gears, was introduced at the New York World's Fair in 1964, and subsequent Ambassadeur models are still produced by the company. The professional angler Paul Gustafson worked for seven years as chief angling consultant for ABU Garcia. Today, they still continue the Ambassadeur line, along with a branched off line of low profile cast reels, the Ambassadeur Revo. Collections There are collectors of ABU Equipment. ABU Garcia Collectors from all around the world choose to buy, sell and exchange rare items on popular auction sites such as eBay.com and Tradera.com (Swedish). Rare items can fetch thousands of dollars. Specialist sites exist to aid finding these items such as Auction Angler. Publications that aid the collector of merchandise of ABU Garcia include The Ambassadeur and I and its sequel The Ambassadeur and I Final Chapter both by Simon Shimomura. There is also a book titled Vintage Fishing Reels of Sweden by Daniel Skupien, that contains a large amount of valuable information on ABU Garcia fishing tackle, as well as a comprehensive work detailing the history of smaller Ambassadeur reels,¬¥Small Ambassadeurs: The Legendary Light-line Fishing Reels: The Ambassadeur 2500C, 1500C and related Models by authors Espen Sjaastad and Karl-Eric Svensson.

Scruby and wargaming To meet the needs of wargamers for inexpensive but historically accurate miniatures, Scruby began casting figures made of type metal in 1955 and selling them from his shop in central California. Scruby made innovative use of RTV rubber molds. In 1958 Scruby began selling figures of his own design which he sold for 15 cents apiece as late as 1962. In 1963 he began using the 50/50 tin/lead alloy that would remain the industry standard into the 1990s. In 1956, he organized the first US (and perhaps first anywhere) miniatures convention in California, and in 1957, he launched War Game Digest, the first publication devoted to military miniatures gaming (initially with 50 subscribers). Published quarterly, War Game Digest became the publication around which the early miniatures hobby coalesced. In 1962, Scruby began to publish Table Top Talk, intended as a promotional publication for his lines of miniatures and sets of miniatures rules, and ceased publishing War Game Digest in 1963. Jack Scruby was also a founder of a miniature wargaming club in 1971 along with Robert (Bob) Casey, Stephen (Steve) R. Casey, Elliot M. Derman, Michael (Mike)W. Frank, Raymond (Ray) James Jackson, Wayne Ludvickson, David Rusk, Ronald (Ron) Vaughan, and Harold (Hal) Windell. This Club was very informal and had no name until the meeting on October 7, 1972, when on a motion by Ray Jackson, his proposal to call the Club the San Joaquin Valley War Gaming Association (SJVWGA), was unanimously accepted. The Club then became a formal organization with dues and officers, but no written BY-Laws. The SJVWGA on the same date became a chapter of the now defunct Spartan International. The San Joaquin Valley War Gaming Association still exists to this day as a subdivision of the War Gaming Society (WGS). From the late 1950s until October 1973, Jack Scruby's miniatures business was in Tulare County, specifically in or near Visalia. Then he moved to Cambria in San Luis Obispo County (the California coast near Hearst Castle) where he opened a retail shop, called like his mail- order business, The Soldier Factory. It was there that Charles Kuralt and his CBS On The Road crew came in August 1977 to film a segment for the CBS Evening News. In 1975The Courier's Timeline of the Historical Miniatures Wargaming Hobby Scruby introduced a line of fantasy figures using the 30mm scale advocated by Gary Gygax in ChainmailHistoriFigs ‚Äîwebsite of a company that continues to manufacture Scruby miniatures and appropriate for use with Dungeons & Dragons.

From the Romansh form of the first comes the name Adula, which is used to designate the north-eastern portion of the Lepontine Alps.John Ball, The Alpine guide, Central Alps, 1866, London The German name \\"Rheinwaldhorn\\" comes from the Rheinwald region. Geography Vals The Rheinwaldhorn is the culminating point of the eastern portion of the Lepontine Alps and the Adula group. In this area, the watershed between the Rhine and the Po river has no determinate direction, and exhibits a dislocated appearance. The peaks of the Adula form an irregular group, all the highest lying in a cluster not more five kilometres distant from the centre, which may be fixed as the foot of the Rheinwald Glacier. From the central group a considerable range extends due south more than 15 kilometres, between Val Blenio and Val Calanca, gradually diminishing in height. A parallel ridge connected with the main massif divides the Val Calanca from Val Mesocco; it surpasses but in few points the height of 9,000 feet. The northern ridge, longer but less regular than the first- mentioned, extends fully 20 kilometres, from the central group to the Piz Nadils over Sumvitg in the valley of the Vorderrhein. Politically, the summit of the Rheinwaldhorn is split between two cantons and three municipalities. On the west side is the municipality of Blenio (Ticino) and on the east side are the municipalities of Vals and Hinterrhein (Graub√ºnden). Climbing history The ascent by Placidus a Spescha The summit of the Rheinwaldhorn was first reached in 1789 by Placidus a Spescha. For seventy years no attempts seems to have been made to repeat the ascent. In 1859, Weilenmann reached the summit alone. The next and third recorded ascent was made in 1861 by Coaz (a topographer who made the first ascent of Piz Bernina), with three companions, and a chamois-hunter named Peter Anton Jellier, of Vals. Coaz gave an account of the expedition in the Jahresbericht der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft Graub√ºnden. Sleeping at the Zapport Alps, they mounted to the spot named Paradies, located below the Paradies Glacier. A faint sheep-tract was followed for some distance: they then took to the glacier, but after some time returned to its southern bank. The first stage of the ascent was completed when they gained the col (Lenta Pass) in the ridge between the Rheinwaldhorn and G√ºferhorn. From thence the way lay along the ar√™te. This was very narrow, and in some places difficult, where steep rocks projected through the n√©v√©. After overcoming the rocks, the travellers found the ridge wider, but also much steeper than below, and to reach the highest point it was necessary to wind round the north side of the peak, so that the final climb was made from the north-west. The summit is a ridge about 200 feet long, running from north to south, and in one part bare of snow. Here in the two following ascents were found some remains of the cairn erected there seventy years before by Placidus a Spescha. The Rheinwaldhorn seen from the Paradies Glacier The peaks of the Adula group had not been frequented by foreign travellers until 1863, when Morshead made the first ascent of the Vogelberg. In the following year Freshfield, with two friends, reached the summit of the Rheinwaldhorn from the side of the Lenta Glacier, striking the shoulder of the peak above the lowest point in the ridge connecting it with the G√ºferhorn. The first winter solo ascent was made by Daniele Gianora in 1942.

Types include underblankets, overblankets, throws, and duvets. An electric underblanket is placed above the mattress and below the bottom bed sheet. This is the most common type in the UK and Commonwealth countries, where it is known by default as an \\"electric blanket\\"; in the U.S. and Canada, where it is less common, it is called an electric heated mattress pad. An electric overblanket is placed above the top bed sheet, and is the most common type in the U.S. and Canada, where it is called an \\"electric blanket\\". Electric blankets usually have a control unit that adjusts the amount of heat the blanket produces by pulsing current at different intervals. Blankets for two-person beds often have separate controls for each side of the bed. The electric blanket may be used to pre-heat the bed before use or to keep the occupant warm while in bed. Electric blankets use between 15 and 115 watts. Some modern \\"low voltage\\" electric blankets have thin carbon fiber wires and work on 12 to 24 volts. Mechanism Much like heating pads, electric blankets use an insulated wire or heating element inserted into a fabric that heats when it is plugged in. The temperature control unit, located between the blanket and the electrical outlet, manages the amount of current entering into the heat elements in the blanket. The heating of an area can be seen with a thermal camera after two minutes under a comforter. Some modern electric blankets use carbon fiber elements that are far less bulky and conspicuous than older heating wires. Carbon fiber is also used as the heating element in many high-end heated car seats. Blankets can be purchased with rheostats that regulate the heat by managing body heat and blanket temperatures, ensuring a comfortable experience. Safety  Overheating  Newer electric blankets have a shutoff mechanism to prevent the blanket from overheating or catching fire. Older blankets (prior to about 2001) may not have a shut-off mechanism; users run the risk of overheating. Older blankets are considered fire hazards. Some electric blankets work on relatively low (12 to 24) voltage, including those that plug into ordinary household electrical outlets. In the US, such blankets are sold by Soft Heat, Serta, and Select Comfort.In the US, as of October 2013, Perfect Fit Industries seems to be the only distributor of such blankets. * See: * See: * See also the incomplete information at: Such blankets also include 12-volt blankets designed for in-car use; they tend to shut off automatically every 45 minutes or so. Old or damaged blankets concern fire safety officials internationally. The use of such blankets is of concern due to the combination of heat, electricity, the abundance of flammable bedding material, and a sleeping occupant. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 5,000 fires per year are caused by faulty electric blankets, of which 99% are believed to have been caused by blankets 10 years or older.http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/electric-blankets Electric blankets also present a burn risk to those who cannot feel pain, such as those with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or who are unable to react to it, such as small children, quadriplegics, and the elderly. As with any source of heat over the groin, use of electric blankets can reduce fertility in men.  Cancer  No mechanism by which SLF (Super low frequency)-EMFs (Electromagnetic field) or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified. Unlike high-energy (ionizing) radiation, EMFs in the non- ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum cannot damage DNA or cells directly. Some scientists have speculated that SLF-EMFs could cause cancer through other mechanisms, such as by reducing levels of the hormone melatonin. There is some evidence that melatonin may suppress the development of certain tumors. In popular culture A cartoon electrical blanket with its electrical temperature control acting as an anthropomorphic face named \\"Blanky\\" was portrayed in the 1987 film The Brave Little Toaster. In the 1951 film The Thing from Another World, a haphazardly thrown electric blanket melted the block of ice that encased the alien monster, releasing it.

The armed forces of the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation have two such insignia for higher military ranks, both in the form of a five-pointed star of gold and platinum with diamonds. They are worn around neck when in parade uniform (originally under the collar of the parade tunic, since 1955 on top of the necktie). There are two different sizes of star. Officially their names have changed, depending on what ranks received the right to wear them, and are known as the large marshal's star and the small marshal's star. The marshal's star corresponds with the western use of the marshal's baton. On the death of the recipient, the award is returned to the diamond fund for re-use. In 2013, new shoulder insignias were instituted for generals of the army, fleet admirals, and generals of the army (air force) which have one large marshal's star on the board similar to the style worn by Soviet generals from the early 1970s through 1997. Recipients The official name, size and number of diamonds correspond to the marshal's rank. Marshal's stars were first awarded to the marshals of the Soviet Union and admirals of the fleet of the Soviet Union.

Early life Wymark was born Patrick Carl Cheeseman in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, the son of Thomas William Cheeseman and Maria Agnes (n√©e Olsen), daughter of Carl Olsen, a Finnish seaman. He had an older brother, John William Cheeseman (born 1924). He was brought up in neighbouring Grimsby and frequently revisited the area at the height of his career. He was educated at St Mary's Catholic School and Wintringham Boys' Grammar School in Grimsby, before being conscripted into the Royal Navy during World War II and serving as a midshipman in the Mediterranean. On being discharged, he received a government grant to read English at University College, London, where performed in the university's dramatic society. Career Wymark dropped out of university to train at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and making his first stage appearance in a walk-on part in Othello in 1951. He toured South Africa the following year and then directed plays for the drama department at Stanford University, California. After moving to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, Wymark played a wide range of Shakespearean roles, including Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, Stephano in The Tempest, Marullus in Julius Caesar and Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Other stage credits included the title role in Danton's Death and, with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), Ephihodov in The Cherry Orchard. His theatre roles also included Bosola in a RSC production of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi in 1960. In television, Wymark was best known for his role as the machiavellian businessman John Wilder in the twin drama series The Plane Makers and The Power Game (which were broadcast from 1963 to 1969), which led to offers of real company directorships and the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor in 1965. However, Wymark was a gentle person in real life and was, by his own admission, ignorant of business matters. He considered the character of Wilder a \\"bastard\\" and was described by his wife Olwen as \\"the most inefficient, dreamy muddler in the world.\\" In the mid-1960s, Wymark was considered as the replacement for William Hartnell in the title role of Doctor Who. Wymark's film appearances included: Children of the Damned (1964), Operation Crossbow (1965), Repulsion (1965), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Witchfinder General (1968), Battle of Britain (1969), Doppelg√§nger (1969), The Blood on Satan's Claw (1970) and Cromwell (1970) Personal life Wymark married American playwright Olwen Buck (known as Olwen Wymark) in 1953; the couple met while both were students at University College, London. He took his acting name from his wife's paternal grandfather, the writer William Wymark Jacobs. The couple lived near Parliament Hill in Hampstead, London, and had four children, including the future actress Jane Wymark. Wymark's grave in Highgate Cemetery Wymark died suddenly in Melbourne, Australia on 20 October 1970, aged 44, of a heart attack in the hotel room in which he was staying.

History 1907‚Äì1943: Founding and early years Berkshire School (for boys) was established in 1907 at the foot of Mount Everett, one of the highest mountains in Massachusetts, by Seaver Burton Buck, a Harvard graduate who had previously taught at Hackley School. Buck led the school until 1943. Seaver Buck 1930s His educational philosophy is reported as a \\"Victorian disciplinarian [who] was sometimes subverted by a pixieish manner.\\" It is also reported that during this period the school \\"lacked the prestige of top-drawer prep schools.\\" Despite this fact, when Albert Keep became headmaster in 1943, the school instituted an Education with Wings program, which enabled students to gain a high school diploma and simultaneously prepare for World War II. 1943‚Äì1970: Rapid growth In 1943, Delano de Windt, a 1911 graduate of the school, became headmaster. He was soon followed by John E. Godman in 1951, who increased the school's enrollment to 330 boys and expanded the faculty to 35 teachers. In 1964, an arts and science wing was added to Berkshire Hall. In 1969, Berkshire also enrolled nine girls as day students in what Godman described as \\"an experiment\\" in coeducation. This led to full-scale coeducation. 1971‚Äì1987: Changes At the beginning of the 1970s, Robert Minnerly took over as headmaster. Under his leadership, the school restructured its scholastic mission and added new programs in computer science, ethics, health, and environmental science.Berkshire School: History & Traditions His successors built on these changes and added new programs of their own. Under James Moore (1979 - 1987), Berkshire constructed a 35,000 square foot athletic center and renovated the gymnasium to house a modern library which today boasts 40,000 volumes. 1988‚Äì2003: Dilemmas of a new decade In 1991, Richard Unsworth whose previous experience included being the headmaster at Northfield Mount Hermon School became headmaster. During Unsworth headmastership the school introduced co-curricular programs in Chinese and outdoor education though the school's \\"reputation for being lax about drugs\\" remained an issue. Whilst Unsworth incorporated drug-awareness and counseling programs after a series of drug-related incidents he resigned his post. The board of trustees turned to Paul Christopher (1996 - 2002), an ethicist and previous head of philosophy at West Point, New York, as the next headmaster to address the renewed public embarrassment around drugs. Drug and alcohol use \\"declined dramatically\\" under Christopher. In June 2002 Christopher resigned as headmaster \\"amidst sexual harassment allegations.\\" A year later, the board of trustees turned to Larry Piatelli (2003), a Harvard graduate, to reverse the school's decline.

Locals refer to the area as the Tricorner Region because of the region's location at the intersection of California, Oregon, and Nevada state lines. The valley is east of the Modoc County seat of Alturas. The area is part of the Great Basin which extends across most of the northern half of Nevada. Terrain Most of the valley is over 4,000 feet above mean sea level (AMSL), and could be characterized as a high altitude desert valley. A series of alkaline lakes occupy low-lying areas. Forested mountains mark the west side of the valley. The Hays Canyon Range, (mostly east of the Nevada state line) is to the east, and the Warner Mountains border the west. The valley is considered part of the Great Basin, a desert region roughly covering the geographic majority of Nevada and extending into Utah; also regions of southeast Oregon, and southern California, in the east. Communities in Surprise Valley include Eagleville (ZIP Code 96110), Cedarville (96104), Lake City (96115), and Fort Bidwell (96112). Visiting Most of the land west of the main north-south highway, Surprise Valley Road, is US Forest Service land. To the east of the road, most land is owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Recreational facilities on BLM lands tie in with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge, Nevada (formerly called Sheldon Antelope Refuge). Over the region, opportunities for hiking, exploring dirt roads, birding, stalking antelope with cameras, fishing, camping, and mountain biking are available. Big game and bird hunting is popular among some area visitors. A BLM brochure warns, \\"Snowstorms occasionally strand travelers. May and June snowstorms are not uncommon.\\" There are hot springs and abandoned mine shafts throughout the region. Transportation Two gas stations exist in Cedarville. One (Rabbit Trax) is attended normal business hours, the other not normally attended. Both accept cards to pump any time. Cedar Pass on State Route 299 is the main east-west road connecting the area with California and the county seat, Alturas. State Route 447 allows passage toward Reno, Nevada via the Black Rock Desert community of Gerlach, Nevada. It is about 152 miles from Cedarville to Reno via this route. A segment of the Applegate-Lassen Route, a Nineteenth Century pioneer wagon route to the area, crosses the valley diagonally from north of State Route 299 to Fandango Pass. The route is also known as the California National Historic Trail. Other roads out of the valley are unpaved. Because of its location along the Nevada state line, it is normal to see patrol cars from the Nevada Highway Patrol and the Washoe County Sheriff's Department transiting the area. Telecommunications Wired telephone service in this part of area code 530 appears to work out of a single central office and is provided by Frontier Communications. There is wireless service to some areas of the valley. This is a remote area and services that people from cities expect are sometimes degraded, expensive, or unavailable. The valley is one of the last places in California where Department of Transportation (Caltrans) highway workers have no radio communications coverage. California Highway Patrol radios were mostly useless in the area until the 1980s installation of a remote-controlled base station intended to cover the valley. The unvoted base station works over a 76 MHz link to establish radio connectivity from the Highway Patrol's command center to this remote area. Indian tribal governments There are two sovereign tribal governments in the valley: The Cedarville Rancheria and the Fort Bidwell Indian Community of the Fort Bidwell Reservation of California. The Cedarville Rancheria is a Paiute community on the southwest edge of Cedarville; it is led by Chairwoman Virginia Lash. The larger Fort Bidwell Paiute community is located at the Fort Bidwell Reservation to the north, and is led by Chairman Aaron Townsend. Special districts The area is entirely inside the Modoc County Air Pollution Control District. It is served by K-through-12 provider Surprise Valley Joint Unified School District headquartered in Cedarville. The Surprise Valley Hospital District, also known as Surprise Valley Healthcare District, operates a clinic in Cedarville. Cedarville Water District exists in Cedarville.

The title of Duke of Lauenburg derives from the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, which, since its foundation in 1269, was ruled in succession by 29 dukes from six dynastic houses and lines, and by an additional four dukes from a temporary dynastic branch line (Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, the first would-be duchess regnant, was kept from inheriting the duchy by male rulers of neighbouring states). The duchy was held by various countries, including France from 1803 to 1805 and from 1810 to 1814, Prussia from 1805 to 1806, and Westphalia from 1806 to 1810. The kings of Denmark, members of the House of Oldenburg, held the Duchy of Lauenburg from 1814 to 1864, when the territory came under Prussian control as a result of the Second Schleswig War, though it was not immediately annexed to Prussia. In 1865, the estates of Saxe-Lauenburg offered rule of the duchy to King William I of Prussia. He accepted during the same year, ruling it in personal union until the estates decided upon the merger of their state with Prussia as of July 1, 1876. After the death in 1888 of the last ruling duke, Wilhelm I (who after 1870 was also German emperor), the now purely honorific title of Duke of Lauenburg was granted to Otto von Bismarck after his dismissal as Chancellor of Germany in 1890.

The 1,687 acre (6.7 km2) recreation area is located near Le Roy, Illinois. The predecessor of Moraine View, the McLean County Conservation Area, traces its history to 1959. The park was renamed Moraine View State Park in 1975, then Moraine View State Recreation Area in 1995. It is managed for active recreation, including camping, hiking, swimming, boating, hunting and fishing. Camping available includes Class A sites with electricity and nearby modern toilet and shower facilities, to group camps and primitive backpacking sites. Hunters use the park for whitetail deer, pheasant, and wild turkey. Moraine View was one of eleven state parks slated to close indefinitely on November 1, 2008 due to budget cuts by former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich.Dempsey, Pam G. \\"Governor closing 24 state sites, including Kickapoo State Park\\", The News Gazette (Champaign, Illinois), August 29, 2008, accessed August 31, 2008.

The centerpiece of Moraine View is the 158 acre (0.6 km2) Dawson Lake, an artificial reservoir built in 1962-1963. Fish stocked in the lake by the DNR include largemouth bass, bluegill (the state fish of Illinois), sunfish, bullhead, crappie, channel catfish, walleye, yellow perch and northern pike. Geology Moraine View State Recreation Area is located atop a moraine, a low, rolling ridge located where a vanished ice sheet dumped ground rock and till while melting. Moraines are common post- glacial geological features, and can be found throughout the U.S. Midwest. This moraine was produced by the Wisconsin glaciation, about 70,000 to 10,000 years before present. Moraine View SRA is the headwaters for Salt Creek, a major tributary of the Sangamon River, one of the largest rivers in central Illinois. The northeastern face of the same moraine, outside the state recreation area, is the headwaters of the main stem of the Sangamon. Although Salt Creek and the main stem of the Sangamon arise on opposite sides of this moraine, they flow more than west before they meet again.

He is most well known for his work with the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique (the name of the Paris Opera at the time). Biography Born Guillaume-Louis Pecour in Paris, he was the son of Jacques Pecour, a royal courier, and Marie Voisin (or Raisin), who lived in the rue des Petits- Champs.Astier 1998, p. 128. He studied dance with Pierre Beauchamps, and likely made his debut in January 1671, as one of eight Zephyrs in the third intermezzo of Psych√© at the theatre of the royal court in the Tuileries Palace.Psych√© libretto 1671, p. 20; La Gorce 1990, p. 4.Craine & Mackrell 2000, p. 365. He first danced at the Paris Opera in 1674 in Jean-Baptiste Lully's Cadmus et Hermione. P√©cour performed as a principal dancer, both at the Opera's Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal in Paris and for the royal court at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, and created many dance parts in works by Lully, including the ballet Le triomphe de l'amour (1681), the opera Pers√©e (1682, as premier danseur opposite Mlle Lafontaine), the opera Amadis (1684), the ballet Le temple de la paix (1685), and the opera Armide (1686).Pitou 1983, p. 285. According to the Parfaict brothers in their history of the Paris Opera, \\"he was handsome, well-built, and danced with the noblest air possible.\\" A letter about the Ballet des Saisons (26 October 1695) claims that \\"the first and second boxes were redoubled, one could have perished in the pit, and people were on each other's laps in the Paradis, all because of P√©cour, who danced a Spanish sarabande.... [H]e dances like a master.\\" After the death of the Opera's director Lully in 1687, the company's ballet master Pierre Beauchamps retired, and P√©cour succeeded him, creating choreography for ballets at the Opera, as well as for the royal court. He mostly retired as a dancer around 1704 and received a pension in 1705, but his name appears on programs as a dancer in 1709 and 1710, and he continued to choreograph ballets at the Opera until his death in 1729.Astier 1998; Christout 1998, p. 87. He mostly created ballets in operas, including ones by Pascal Collasse, Henri Desmarets, and Toussaint Bertin de la Dou√© and choreographed Andr√© Campra's first op√©ra-ballet L'Europe galante in 1697, as well as his Le carnaval de Venise (1699), H√©sione (1700), Tancr√®de (1702), and Les f√™tes v√©nitiennes (1710). Over 100 of P√©cour's ballets have been preserved in Feuillet notation, and they were danced at other royal courts, helping to spread the French style of dancing all over Europe. He was probably the first dance choreographer to have such wide influence.Astier 1998, p. 129; Guest 2006, p. 11. P√©cour was listed as a member of the Acad√©mie Royale de Danse in 1695, when Beauchamps was its director, and in 1719, when Claude Ballon was director. P√©cour died in Paris and was buried in the church of Saint Roche.

Smuggler Cove is a small, picturesque all-weather anchorage on the south side of Sechelt Peninsula near Secret Cove. To access this park by land, visitors can hike 4 km from a parking lot off Hwy 101. This park provides camping, hiking, swimming, kayaking and picnicking. Park Size: 185 hectares. 16 km West of Sechelt on the Sunshine Coast. Accessible by boat from the north end of Welcome Pass. Also accessible from Brooks Road off Hwy 101 halfway between Secret Cove and Halfmoon Bay on the Sunshine Coast. It is a 4 km hike from the parking lot to Smuggler Cove. The Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park draws many boaters and sightseers every year to the protected cove. Many come to explore the many bays of the area, rock cliffs and beach areas. The marine park is considered a wetland park so there are some very sensitive ecological areas along the path designed to protect the ecosystem. Please stay on walking paths and have dogs leashed. Smuggler Cove is an all-weather anchorage with three large anchoring basins for cruising boats. The best entry to the park by boat is through Welcome Passage at low tide when reef and rock projections are visible. The local area has provided many eye bolts located along the shoreline to accommodate stern pins. Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park has some wilderness camping facilities on site. Wilderness camping means no amenities. The hike-in campsite is permitted year round only in the five designated campsites located in the cove. Follow the trail for about 1 km ( 0.4 mi.) from the cove to the camping area from the parking lot. There is no drinking water on site so bring your own. There are two pit toilets. History A possible apocryphal story is that Smuggler Cove owes its name to its reported use by Larry Kelly. Kelly, the ‚ÄúKing of the Smugglers‚Äù who was also known as ‚ÄúPirate‚Äù came up to Canada after fighting for the confederates in the American Civil War. When the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed, many unemployed Chinese workers tried to emigrate to the United States but were forbidden official entry. Kelly assisted the Chinese to cross the border for a fee of $100 each. His insurance against detection was to have the Chinese agree to be roped together and tied to a large hunk of pig iron. If there was a chance that they would be apprehended by U.S. customs, he would throw the iron and Chinese overboard.http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/planning/mgmtplns/smuggler_cv/smuggler_cv_mp.pdf Common misconception is that Larry Kelly was also nicknamed \\"Pig Iron,\\" but this was another smuggler by the name of Jim Kelly.http://sehome.bellinghamschools.org/ExtraCurriculum/Zodiac/Lessons/smuggling-98.htm Gallery Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 01.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 02.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 03.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 04.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 05.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 06.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 07.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 08.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 09.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 10.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park 11.jpg|Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park References https://web.archive.org/web/20080605065800/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/smuggler.html External links * Category:Provincial Parks of British Columbia Category:Sunshine Coast Regional District Category:Protected areas established in 1971 Category:1971 establishments in British Columbia Category:Marine parks of Canada ","title":"Smuggler Cove Marine Provincial Park"},{"id":"4515274","text":"Sooke Mountain Provincial Park is a Class B provincial park located at the southern end of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada.

His father was the uncle of John Adams, second President of the United States. He graduated from Harvard University in 1759. He was ordained September 5, 1764.  History  Adams was eminent as a preacher of the gospel, \\"often explaining the most important doctrines in a rational and scriptural manner, and enforcing them with plainness and pungency. His language was nervous, and while in his public performances he gave instruction he also imparted pleasure. In his addresses to the throne of grace he was remarkable for pertinency of thought and readiness of utterance. Though by bodily constitution he was liable to irritation, yet he held no ill will. His heart was easily touched by the afflictions of others and his sympathy and benevolence prompted him to administer relief, when in his power.\\" About the year 1774, he wrote a pamphlet maintaining, without authority from the Cambridge Platform of 1648, that a pastor has a negative upon the proceedings of the church. Some ministers, who embraced his principles, lost by consequence their parishes. He preached the Dudleian lecture on Presbyterian ordination in 1794. He published a sermon on the nature, pleasures, and advantages of church music, 1771; on Christian unity, 1772; the election sermon, 1782; on April 19, 1783; at the ordination of Enoch Whipple, 1788.

Founded in 1911, the park was named for Donald Alexander Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, a wealthy philanthropist and railway pioneer. It lies within the Strathcona Regional District. The Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve, established in 2000, includes three watersheds in the western area of the park. Geography One of the many lakes of the Forbidden Plateau Della Falls, the second tallest waterfall on Vancouver Island The park is east of Gold River and west of Campbell River. At , it contains the highest peaks of the Vancouver Island Ranges. Some notable mountains located within the park boundaries include: * Golden Hinde - * Elkhorn Mountain - * Mount Colonel Foster - * Mount Albert Edward - For others, see the List of mountains in Strathcona Provincial Park. Strathcona Park is also known for its lakes, waterfalls, and glaciers. Buttle Lake is a popular destination for swimming, canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. Also located in the park is Della Falls which, at in height, is among the highest waterfalls in Canada. The thick Karmutsen Formation is the most abundant rock unit in the park. It is a pile of tholeiitic pillow basalts and breccias. It is also the oldest, thickest and most widespread formation on Vancouver Island found on Triple Peak, Cat's Ears Peak and the Mackenzie Range. Ecology * Sub-alpine ecosystem: western redcedar, Douglas fir, grand fir, amabilis fir, western hemlock, mountain hemlock and creeping juniper * Wildlife: Roosevelt elk, Vancouver Island marmot, Vancouver Island wolf, black bear, cougar and the coastal black-tailed deer * Birds: chestnut- backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, winter wren and kinglet, Canada jay, Steller's jay, blue grouse, ruffed grouse and white-tailed ptarmigan History This area is the traditional territory of the Mowachaht and Muchalaht people of the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation. Commander John Buttle, for whom Buttle Lake is named, first explored the area in the 1860s. In 1890, the British Columbia government conducted a survey to define the boundaries of the E&N; Railway land grant. The grant, given to Robert Dunsmuir's company in exchange for the construction of the railway, extended from Muir Creek, near Sooke at the southern end of Vancouver Island, in a straight line to Crown Mountain. All of the land between that line and the east coast of Vancouver Island was included in the grant. The line that formed the west boundary of the grant became the east boundary of Strathcona Park when it was created in 1911. Although originally planned to reach Campbell River, the railway was never constructed past Courtenay. At the time of the grant, the area within the present park boundaries was considered unexplored. In 1894 and 1896, the area was explored by Reverend William W. Bolton. Bolton's explorations and federal government interest in establishing a national park led BC Premier Sir Richard McBride to set aside a park reserve in June 1910. McBride's Minister of Lands, Price Ellison, lead an expedition to explore the new park reserve which included the first ascent of Crown Mountain on July 29, 1910. W.W. Urquhart led a survey party, which included photographer W.R. Kent and Einar Anderson, throughout the park area in 1913 and 1914. They climbed many of the peaks and named geographic features throughout the park. The First World War caused elaborate plans for a railway and two hotels to be abandoned. As part of the war effort, there was logging in the Elk River Valley. Over the years which have followed, other industrial uses have affected the park. Mineral claims were staked in the park as early as 1911. In 1939, mining and logging became permitted in the park and in 1959 the Myra Falls Mine (originally owned by Westmin) was opened. This mine continues to operate in a section of the park called Strathcona-Westmin Provincial Park. This area is entirely within the larger park and comprises 1.5% of the total area. As a Class B park, it is intended to cease its existence and return to the main park when the mine eventually ceases operations. The mine is currently owned by Nyrstar and produces zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold concentrates. In the mid-1950s, around the shoreline of Buttle Lake was logged to accommodate the increase in water levels from the creation of the Strathcona Dam in 1955-1958, impounding Upper Campbell Lake. Strathcona Dam is one of the three hydroelectric dams built to power the John Hart Generating Station on the Campbell River. The variation in water levels in Buttle Lake periodically exposes the stumps. In 1987, the provincial government announced plans to remove large areas from the park for logging and other industrial uses. The Friends of Strathcona formed a blockade which attracted significant media attention and resulted in the arrest of 63 protesters. The government engaged Peter Larkin to conduct an independent review of the future of the park which eventually resulted in the Strathcona Park Master Plan. Most of the park is designated a conservation area under this plan. The Strathcona Park Public Advisory Committee was set up at this time to provide advice to BC Parks when making management decisions concerning the park. In 1995, the McBride Creek area () and the Megin watershed () were added to the park. Later, the Divers and Rossitor Lake addition was included as well. Recreation Canoeing on Jim Mitchell Lake near the southern end of the park The park is a popular destination for hikers and mountain climbers, as well as swimmers, canoeists, and kayakers. There is an extensive network of hiking trails in the park; visitor facilities are located at Buttle Lake and Forbidden Plateau. The park includes campgrounds, backpacking and cross-country skiing trails, and downhill skiing. There is fishing, in season, for cutthroat, rainbow, and Dolly Varden trout. Campfires are banned in all areas of the park, except in provided fire pits. Although there are no commercial tourist facilities in the park itself, the nearby Strathcona Park Lodge and Outdoor Education Centre provides outdoors education. Visitor facilities are available in the nearby communities of Campbell River and Gold River. Mount Washington Alpine Resort, which offers downhill and cross-country skiing, is located adjacent to the park. The Strathcona Park Lodge also offers weekend camps for tourists or international students with activities such as rock climbing, kayaking, hiking, swimming, etc. See also *List of British Columbia Provincial Parks *List of Canadian provincial parks *List of National Parks of Canada References External links Strathcona Provincial Park at BC Parks *Strathcona Westmin Provincial Park at BC Parks *Official park map (PDF) *Geology of Strathcona Provincial Park Retrieved October 28, 2006 *Club Tread lists various hiking routes in the park.

Beck's fascination with the guitar sprang as much from his interest in Les Paul, the man, as from his love of the guitar itself. Beck told an interviewer: \\"It had a deep powerful sound and you could use it to imitate just about anything - violin, sax, cello, even a sitar.\\" Beck also used an \\"oxblood\\" coloured 1954 Les Paul Standard, with PAF pickups, from 1972 to 1976 and is pictured with the guitar on the cover artwork of his Blow by Blow album.

In due course, according to biographers Jan Mark Wolkin and Bill Keenom, Bloomfield swapped that guitar for a 1959 Les Paul Standard and $100. This was the guitar Bloomfield used as a member of the Electric Flag, and on the Super Session album and concerts. He later veered between the Les Paul and the Fender Telecaster, but Bloomfield's use of the Les Paul, as did Keith Richards' with the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton's with John Mayall influenced many others to use the model. Bloomfield eventually lost the guitar in Canada; Wolkin and Keenom's biography revealed a club owner kept the guitar as partial compensation after Bloomfield cut short a round of appearances. Its whereabouts today are unknown. *Marc Bolan (T.Rex) used Les Paul Standards, Customs and Flying Vs.

The book was released in the United Kingdom on the 4th of September 2000, and in United States release on 21st of May 2001, where it became a New York Times Bestseller. Since its release, the book has sold more than nine million copies worldwide, been listed on the BBC's The Big Read, and in 2005 received a California Young Reader Medal.\\"BBC ‚Äì The Big Read\\". BBC. April 200bbc3. Retrieved 1 December 2012 The book's plot revolves around Alex Rider being secretly recruited into MI6 to investigate the Stormbreaker computer factory and stop a terrorist attack that will kill hundreds of thousands of British school children. A film adaptation, starring Alex Pettyfer as Alex Rider, was released in 2006. Plot summary The book begins with Alex Rider learning that his uncle and guardian, Ian Rider, has been killed in a car crash. Unbeknownst to Alex and his housekeeper Jack Starbright, Ian's job as a banker was actually a cover for his role as an MI6 agent. Alex becomes suspicious upon being told that Ian had not been wearing his seat belt and discovering that Ian's office has been emptied out. He finds his uncle's car at a wrecking yard and discovers that his uncle had been murdered, being shot several times. After a near escape from a car crusher, Alex is asked to visit Ian's former employers, ostensibly the Royal & General bank. He breaks into Ian's office at the bank, discovering evidence of his uncle's double life before he is knocked out by a drugged dart. After waking up, Alex meets MI6 head Alan Blunt and his deputy, Mrs Tulip Jones. They reveal the truth about his uncle's job and explain that they had sent Ian to investigate Herod Sayle, a wealthy Lebanese (Egyptian in American adaptations) businessman who has developed a revolutionary new computer, the Stormbreaker. Sayle plans to give a free Stormbreaker to every secondary school in the United Kingdom, accompanied by a grand activation ceremony in the Science Museum, supposedly as a gesture of thanks for the country taking him in when he was a child after a wealthy American couple sent him to England after he saved their lives in Olive Street. In his last communication with them, Ian had warned MI6 that Stormbreaker could not be allowed to leave Sayle's manufacturing plant. However, before he could explain, he was assassinated by Yassen Gregorovich, a professional killer supposedly working for Sayle, on the return to London. Intending to use him to covertly investigate Sayle, MI6 recruits Alex by essentially blackmailing him; if he does not co-operate, Jack will be deported back to America, his house will be sold and he will leave his school and friends for an institute until he is of age. They put him through a gruelling eleven-day long stint at a SAS training camp (which MI6 also uses), before deploying him to Herod Sayle's base in Cornwall, using the alias of another boy, Felix Lester, who won a competition to visit the plant and be the first child to use a Stormbreaker. To aid him in his mission, Alex is given a grappling hook disguised as a yo-yo, acne cream capable of dissolving metal, and a Nintendo Gameboy which functions as a transmitter, smoke screen, bug detector, and a surveillance camera and microphone, provided by MI6 agent Smithers. Sayle shows Alex around his mock-Victorian mansion, which houses a large jellyfish aquarium containing a giant Portuguese Man o' War, located in his office. Alex also meets Mr Grin, a butler and henchman whose name derives from his time as a circus performer, catching knives with his teeth. An accident that happened when he was performing in his hometown left him without a tongue and two large scars on either side of his mouth, which gave him the appearance of constant smiling. Initially, the trip goes well, with Alex finding a cryptic diagram made by Ian in the canopy of his four-poster bed. However, Sayle grows to dislike Alex, firstly after Alex is discovered in a restricted area of the Stormbreaker factory, and later when Alex defeats Sayle in a game of snooker, where Sayle places bets on the balls. While investigating the base at night, Alex sees several of Sayle's agents unloading metal cases with great care from a Chinese nuclear submarine at the local port, with Yassen supervising. When one of the agents drops a metal case, he is promptly shot dead by Yassen. The next afternoon, Alex decides to visit Port Tallon, the nearby village but finds himself attacked by a pair of armed guards on quad bikes. He survives by tricking the guards into crashing: one collides with an electric fence while the other falls from a cliff face. While searching the library, Alex finds a map in a book about tin mining which matches the diagram left by Ian, discovering that Sayle's land once belonged to Sir Rupert Dozmary, a tin-mining magnate. He also learns that Ian had borrowed several books about viruses, and assumes that Sayle plans to use the Stormbreaker network to release a computer virus into Britain's computer infrastructure. Alex investigates the Dozmary mine and, following the path left by his uncle, discovers a large computer manufacturing facility, where the Stormbreaker computers are being filled with a strange fluid. Alex realises that the 'viruses' being investigated by Ian are not computer viruses, but biological weapons. Alex is detected, and nearly escapes but is eventually caught and tranquillised. When he comes to, Sayle explains to Alex his plan. When Sayle attended school, he was bullied because of his accent and skin colour. The worst bully was none other than the future Prime Minister, leading him to despise English children and all of Britain in general. As a result, Sayle plans to take revenge on the Prime Minister and Britain with his \\"April Fools Joke\\"; when the computers are activated by the Prime Minister, the virus, a potent, nearly unstoppable genetically modified strain of smallpox, will be released into every school in the country, killing every schoolchild and teacher in England as well as those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Alex is then left handcuffed to a chair, until Nadia Vole, an assistant of Sayle's, frees him, claiming that she is a fellow spy who worked with Ian Rider. However, as they head to find a mobile phone to call MI6 and inform them of Sayle's plan, she triggers a trapdoor which drops Alex into the jellyfish tank and stays behind to watch him die. Alex eventually gets free by using the acne cream gadget to damage the tank's supporting iron girders, causing it to rupture and sending thousands of gallons of water crashing into the room. Unfortunately for Vole, she dies painfully and instantly, as she stood directly in front of the tank when it burst, and the immense jellyfish landed right on her. Snatching up a harpoon gun, Alex rushes outside, only to find that Sayle's private helicopter has already left, leaving only a cargo plane on the tarmac. Using the handle of the harpoon gun, Alex knocks out a guard, taking his jeep and pistol. As he starts the jeep, several other jeeps start to pursue him as the cargo plane starts to take off. Through some fancy driving and good fortune, Alex manages to cause the destruction of the hostile jeeps. Tying the nylon cord of the yo-yo gadget to the harpoon with the yo-yo clipped to his belt, Alex shoots the harpoon which catches on the underbelly of the airborne plane. Using the gadget, he gets himself on to the plane where he confronts the pilot, who is none other than Mr Grin. Alex instructs Mr Grin to fly to London by threatening him with the pistol. When they are finally over London, Alex realises that there is not much time left before noon. He spots several parachutes and uses one to jump off the plane. Mr Grin turns the plane around hoping to ram into Alex. Alex pulls out the Game Boy Color and activates a cartridge disguised as a game called \\"Bomber Boy\\", which activates a smoke bomb that he left on the plane. Unable to see, Mr Grin loses control of the plane and fatally crashes into a dock near the River Thames. Alex crashes through the roof of the Science Museum and dangles from his parachute, caught on a beam. Alex draws the gun he took from a guard back at Sayle's mansion and fires blindly at the Stormbreaker computer, one accidentally hitting the Prime Minister in the wrist and Sayle himself being struck by two more, and another bullet hits the mouse for the computer and it explodes. Afterwards, however, he inexplicably vanishes. Mrs Jones saves Alex's life by ordering security not to open fire on him. MI6 immediately recalls all the computers, citing \\"safety issues\\". Later, after a debriefing by Alan Blunt and Mrs Jones, Alex enters a taxi. The driver is in fact Sayle who holds Alex at gunpoint. He leads Alex to the top of a building where he is about to shoot Alex but is himself shot by Yassen Gregorovich, who lands in a helicopter. When Alex questions Yassen about why he shot Sayle, Yassen explains that Sayle had become an embarrassment to \\"(his) employers\\", so he had to be eliminated. Knowing that he is facing his uncle's killer, Alex tells Yassen he will one day kill him, but Yassen brushes aside the comment and tells Alex to drop the spy business and become a normal schoolboy again, before leaving in the helicopter. Critical reception Critical reception for Stormbreaker was mixed to positive, with the book being placed on multiple ALA lists. Commonsensemedia praised Stormbreaker for its action sequences, but criticised its dialogue and logic.

Michael Wood died in 1942 whilst on Army duty, of a heart attack. After his death, Ursula Wood continued her relationship with Vaughan Williams, with the acknowledgement of Vaughan Williams' wife Adeline, an invalid who was crippled by arthritis, and for whom Ursula was the carer. Ursula Wood became Ralph's literary advisor and personal assistant. Adeline Vaughan Williams died in 1951. Ursula Wood and Ralph Vaughan Williams married in February 1953. She encouraged her husband to resume the composition he had been forced to set aside during his first wife's illness, writing the libretto to two of his last choral works, including the cantata for Christmas Hodie. Ralph Vaughan Williams died in 1958. Following his death, Ursula Vaughan Williams set up residence in Gloucester Crescent near Regent's Park, London.Letter from Ursula Vaughan Williams to Alan Bush ‚Äì Letter No.: VWL3696 ‚Äì The Letters of Ralph Vaughan Williams database In 1964, she published RVW: A Biography of Ralph Vaughan Williams. She completed her autobiography, Paradise Remembered, in 1972, but did not publish the book until 2002. Additionally, she published four novels, including Set to Partners (1968) and The Yellow Dress (1984), and five volumes of poetry. She provided libretti for other composers, including Herbert Howells, Malcolm Williamson and Elisabeth Lutyens, for example, her famous \\"Hymn to St. Cecilia\\", which was put to music by Howells. Vaughan Williams lived for many years in Gloucester Crescent near Camden Town, where her neighbours included Alan Bennett and David Gentleman. She appears as a character in Bennett's autobiographical play and film The Lady in the Van, where she is played by Frances de la Tour.

It is north of Fells Point, south of Johns Hopkins Hospital, east of Old Town and Jonestown and west of Butchers Hill. It is bounded by Fayette Street, Washington Street, Lombard Street, and Central Avenue. The neighborhood surrounds Broadway (formerly known as Market Street in Colonial times) running north from Fells Point to terminate at East North Avenue and is named for the now-defunct Washington Medical College later known as the Church Home and Hospital on Broadway where famed writer/poet Edgar Allan Poe was taken to die in 1849 after being found comatose in a downtown Baltimore street. In the median strip of Broadway is a statue of seven-term mayor of Baltimore, Ferdinand Claiborne Latrobe. City Springs School, a charter school for the Baltimore Curriculum Project, is located in Washington Hill. City Springs was the second school in Baltimore City history to be removed from the state's \\"recon list\\" of failing schools. Fairmount Heights Vocational High School (now closed) is in the area. Also nearby is City Springs Park, which contains recreational facilities. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 7,937 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Washington Hill was 29.1% White, 57.2% African American, 1.3% Native American, 2.2% Asian, 3.1% from other races, and 2.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.3% of the population. 34.0% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 10.0% of housing units were vacant. Washington Hill is home to many descendants of Irish, Czech, Russian, and Polish immigrants, as well as Appalachian people and Lumbee Native Americans. 60.0% of the population were employed, 7.7% were unemployed, and 31.9% were not in the labor force. The median household income was $36,138. About 16.3% of families and 23.8% of the population were below the poverty line. Urban Redevelopment In 1974 Citizens for Washington Hill was established as a federal and city sponsored organization to create a revitalization plan for the community. Betty Hyatt became the leader of the community organization that subsequently led the development of artists housing and studios in the 1500 and 1600 blocks of East Baltimore St, the renovation of a significant number of blocks of housing throughout the neighborhood, and the creation of Washington Hill Mutual Homes, a very successful community housing cooperative. With over 200 resident-owned dwellings that dominate Broadway and the blocks of East Fairmount and East Baltimore Streets, the development has been a model for community-led urban housing development having been visited by Prince Charles of England and President Jimmy Carter.

The screenplay by Anthony Horowitz is based on his 2000 novel Stormbreaker, the first novel in the Alex Rider series. The film stars Alex Pettyfer as Alex Rider, and also stars Mickey Rourke, Bill Nighy, Sophie Okonedo, Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Bolger, Stephen Fry and Ewan McGregor. Stormbreaker was an international co-production between companies and financiers from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. The film's plot follows a teenage boy who is recruited by MI6 after his uncle, a secret agent, is killed in action. He is sent on a mission in Cornwall to gather intelligence behind Stormbreaker, an advanced computer system being provided to schools across Britain, and its creator, billionaire Darrius Sayle. Intended to be the first entry in a film franchise, Stormbreaker grossed between $20.7 and $23.9 million worldwide upon its theatrical release, failing to recoup its $40 million budget and making the film a box office bomb. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film was largely criticized for its lack of originality and believability. As a result of these factors, plans to produce further Alex Rider films were dropped. Plot Alex Rider is a 14-year-old schoolboy who lives with his uncle Ian and their housekeeper Jack Starbright. Ian is supposedly a bank manager and is, much to Alex's regret, often away from home. One day, Alex is told that his uncle has died in a car crash, but quickly discovers that his uncle was actually a spy working for MI6 and was murdered. He is then recruited by his uncle's former employers, Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones of the Special Operations Division of MI6, who explain to Alex that his uncle has been training him as a spy. Alex initially refuses to cooperate but agrees when they threaten to not renew the visa and deport Jack as a result of her visa running out seven years before. Alex is then sent to a military training camp in the Brecon Beacons, the home of the Special Air Service. At first, his fellow trainees look down on him because of his age, but he soon gains their respect for his capabilities. He sets off on his first mission, aided by gadgets from Smithers. Billionaire Darrius Sayle is donating free high-powered computer systems code named Stormbreaker to every school in the United Kingdom. MI6 are suspicious of his seemingly generous plans and send Alex undercover as a competition winner to investigate. There, he meets Sayle himself and his two accomplices, Mr. Grin and Nadia Vole, and is shown the Stormbreaker computer in action. Later, while Alex is having dinner with Sayle, the suspicious Vole steals Alex's phone and tracks the SIM card to his house in Chelsea. She goes there and finds Alex's true identity; while there, she is disturbed by and consequently fights Jack. Despite being outclassed, Jack wins with the help of a blowfish, leaving Nadia to flee the scene. That night, Alex sneaks out of his bedroom window to observe a midnight delivery of mysterious containers to Sayle's lair. The next day, Alex finds himself in trouble when his cover is blown. After attempting to escape from the facility, he is captured, and Sayle explains his true reasons behind Stormbreaker ‚Äì each system contains a modified strain of the smallpox virus which, upon activation in the Stormbreaker release, will kill all of the country's schoolchildren. Sayle leaves Alex tied up and departs for the London Science Museum. Nadia drops Alex into a water-tank to be killed by a giant Portuguese Man o' War, but he escapes using the metal-disintegrating spot cream supplied by Smithers, Nadia is subdued when she is hit by the jellyfish, rupturing the tank in the process. Alex then hitches a ride on a Mil Mi-8 helicopter piloted by Mr. Grin, using a sodium pentothal arrow to gain Mr. Grin's obedience. Alex parachutes out of the helicopter and lands just as the Prime Minister is about to press the button which will activate the computers. Alex uses a rifle to shoot the podium, which destroys the button, and ruins Sayle's plan. Furious, Sayle leaves to carry out his back-up plan, and Alex, with the help of school friend Sabina Pleasure pursues Sayle through the streets of London. Fifty floors up on one of Sayle's skyscrapers, Alex reaches him and unplugs his backup transmitter. Sayle chases him out onto the roof and pushes both Alex & Sabina off the roof, leaving them hanging by a dislodged cable. Unexpectedly, Yassen arrives in a helicopter and shoots Sayle (in the same manner he did Ian) before rescuing Alex. Yassen then tells Alex that Sayle had become an embarrassment to his employers, and that Alex should forget about him, but Alex refuses saying that the killing of his uncle Ian means they are still enemies. Alex returns to school; he and Sabina are talking about what happened and he says that it will never happen again. The film ends with someone observing Alex from a distance. He notices it and realizes that it's not the end.

Stormbreaker was intended by the novel's author, Anthony Horowitz, to be the first entry in a film franchise based on his Alex Rider series. Horowitz, already an established and prolific screenwriter in British television, wrote the screenplay and worked very closely throughout the film's production with director Geoffrey Sax and producers Marc and Peter Samuelson. The Weinstein Company acquired the North American rights to the film, which was filmed in Summer 2005 with six weeks on the Isle of Man and a further six weeks in London. Some of the scenes of the school were filmed in The Grey Coat Hospital and Ballakermeen High School, Douglas, Isle of Man. In 2005, Alex Pettyfer was cast as Alex Rider. He was picked out of 500 hopefuls who auditioned for the role. Pettyfer was originally offered a role in the then-upcoming film Eragon but turned it down, noting that he preferred Stormbreaker because it would be filmed nearer home while Eragon would film in the Czech Republic. In June 2006, the producers signed a deal with Nintendo that made the Nintendo DS a prominent feature in the film, much like the Power Glove in The Wizard. This is an upgrade from the Game Boy Color that Alex used in the novel version. In addition to the Nintendo marketing in the film, Alex's mobile phone is a Nokia 7710 and he uses a sodium pentothal pen to get to London, not a gun. In August 2006, the film was retitled Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker for North American release. A new poster and trailer were released along with the announcement. It was also revealed that the US premiere would take place on the Intrepid aircraft carrier at the Hudson River, New York City. The name of the villain also changed from Herod Sayle to Darrius Sayle, with his nationality switched from Lebanese (Egyptian in the US version of the novel) to American. This was because Mickey Rourke was already in talks to take on the role, so Horowitz adapted the character to suit him. Reception Box office Stormbreaker was distributed by Entertainment Film Distributors in the United Kingdom, where the film made $2,313,496 on its opening weekend, well below its expected target of blockbuster status. The film's grosses gradually declined each week for the remainder of its run, totalling of $12,872,046, making up more than half of what would become the film's final worldwide gross. In the United States, the film was distributed by The Weinstein Company in 221 theatres and grossed $215,177, with an average of $973 per screen and ranking No. 27 during its opening weekend. The film earned $677,646 in the United States and $23,260,224 internationally for a total of $23,937,870 on an estimated budget of $40 million. The Numbers reported a worldwide gross of $20.7 million. In Germany, the film was given a direct-to- video release. In a 2007 interview for Reuters, Horowitz blamed Stormbreakers financial failings on The Weinstein Company's handling of the film's distribution on the American market, particularly their decision to not give it a wide release. According to the writer, \\"Harvey Weinstein decided not to distribute it. It is one of the most bizarre and annoying things that the film didn't get given its shot in America. To this day I don't know why.\\" Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has a score of 34% based on 67 reviews with an average rating of 4.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states \\"Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker is strictly children's fare, as it lacks originality, excitement, and believability.\\" The film also has a score of 42 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" BBC critic Neil Smith gave the film three out of five stars but criticised the \\"unsubtle turns\\" from both Bill Nighy and Stephen Fry. The Hollywood Reporter branded the film as \\"a lame and disappointing affair\\". Although likening it to both the Harry Potter and James Bond series, reviewer Ray Bennett said the film \\"lacks any kind of suspense\\" due to the script. He ended saying that Stormbreaker was unlikely to have a \\"license to kill at the box-office\\". Cinema Blend editor-in-chief Josh Tyler gave the film two and a half stars out of five, and said that, \\"Most of the problems with Stormbreaker all boil down to believability.\\" Boston.coms reporter Wesley Morris also gave Stormbreaker two stars out of five, and said that \\"Geoffrey Sax's filmmaking holds few surprises... but it's swift and competent, despite too many shots of cars on roads that bloat the running time.\\" Author's response During a 2013 interview with the Financial Times, Horowitz stated that the Stormbreaker film was his greatest disappointment, stating that he \\"did not hate it but that it should have been the first of 10 and it wasn't.\\" Cancelled sequels Prior to or after Stormbreakers theatrical release, Horowitz had written a screenplay based on Point Blanc, but stated that the chances of further films based on the Alex Rider novels were \\"fairly slim\\" due to the film's underperformance at the box office. The Weinstein Company eventually cancelled their plans for a sequel, and Horowitz later expressed that the novels \\"do not translate well to the big screen\\".  TV Adaption  A rebooted television series beginning with the second novel Point Blanc was produced by Eleventh Hour Films and Sony Pictures Television. This series was released on Amazon Prime Video and TVNZ On Demand in early June 2020.

History In 1865, General John Bidwell backed a petition from settlers at Red Bluff, California to protect Red Bluff's trail to the Owhyhee Mines of Idaho. The U.S. Army commissioned seven forts for this purpose, and dispatched a Major Williamson in April to explore a site for a fort in either Goose Lake Valley or Surprise Valley, from which he selected a site near Fandango Pass at the base of the Warner Mountains in the north end of Surprise Valley, and orders to build the fort were issued on June 10, 1865. Although Surprise Valley settlers desired Army protection, ranchers dispossessed of lands for the fort complained, and claimed damages from the Army. The fort was built in 1865 amid escalating fighting with the Snake Indians of eastern Oregon and southern Idaho. It was a base for operations in the Snake War that lasted until 1868, the Battle of Infernal Caverns in 1867 with General George Crook, the Modoc War of 1872‚Äì73 and the Bannock and Nez Perce campaigns. Although traffic dwindled on the Red Bluff route once the Central Pacific Railroad extended into Nevada in 1868, the Army staffed Fort Bidwell to quell various uprisings and disturbances until 1890. Both Fort Bidwell and Camp Bidwell, near Chico were named for General John Bidwell. However, Camp Bidwell was commissioned in 1863, renamed Camp Chico by the time Fort Bidwell was commissioned in 1865, and was decommissioned in 1893. Observing confusion between the two, Robert W. Pease explained that such a transfer of name between outposts was a common Army practice of the time. The Fort Bidwell post office opened in 1868. A 1913 book described Fort Bidwell as having a population of about 200, and containing a school and reservation for the Northern Paiute Kid√ºt√∂kad√∂ band (Gidu Ticutta - ‚ÄòYellow-bellied marmot- Eaters‚Äô, also called \\"Northern California Paiute\\"). Fort Bidwell is now registered as California Historical Landmark #430. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that Fort Bidwell had a population of 173.

It is a modern 1950s style, Cold War era, B-grade \\"drive-in\\" movie in the style of The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues, Monster from the Ocean Floor, or The Horror of Party Beach. Written, directed and edited by Christopher R. Mihm, the film was shot on digital video in and around the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. The entire film was made for less than $10,000. The film stars Minnesota & Wisconsin based actors with the director taking a small part. Monster of Phantom Lake has spawned a series of subsequent films including It Came from Another World (10 May 2007), Cave Women on Mars (12 April 2008), Terror from Beneath the Earth (2009), Destination Outer Space (2010), Attack of the Moon Zombies (2011), House of Ghosts (2012), The Giant Spider (2013), and The Late Night Double Feature (2014). The films are all connected to each other, sharing common fictional locations or characters (and actors) or both, forming what the creators call \\"The Mihmiverse\\". Plot synopsis Phantom Lake, a serene lake in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, has long been a dumping ground of various and sundry companies, looking to eliminate their waste products, including atomic waste. It is patrolled by the Canoe Cops, a duo of police officers, who have not yet noticed anything strange in the water. The lake also sports a lush forest surrounding it, a forest which is home to a World War II vet, Michael Kaiser. Driven to insanity by the events of the war, he murdered his wife and fled to the woods, always on the watch for his enemies, the Germans. Kaiser, while trailing two of the dumpers, falls into the lake, directly in the area they've been dumping atomic waste. His body is transformed into that of a monster .. The Monster of Phantom Lake. He soon begins hunting two groups of campers. One of those groups include five teenagers who have just graduated from high school. The other includes a scientist, Professor Jackson, and his graduate student, Stephanie Yates. One person after another falls victim to his deathly hugs, until only three survive. With the help of his great scientific mind - and his trusty pipe - Professor Jackson concludes they can destroy the monster in only one way. It must be prevented from reaching the water from which it was created. And only one person can do it, a girl who just happens to be the spitting image of Kaiser's late wife.

It was discovered by Spacewatch in 2000 and initially classified as a minor planet with provisional designation (also written 2000 EC98). Research in 2001 by Rousselot and Petit at the Besan√ßon observatory in France indicated that it was not a comet, but in December 2005 a cometary coma was detected. In early 2006 the Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature (CSBN) gave it the cometary designation 174P/Echeclus. It last came to perihelion in April 2015, and was expected to reach about apparent magnitude 16.7 near opposition in September 2015.  Name  Echeclus is a centaur in Greek mythology. 60558 Echeclus is only the second comet (after Chiron) that was named as a minor planet, rather than after the name of its discoverer. Chiron is also a centaur; other centaurs are being observed for signs of a cometary coma. Besides Echeclus, seven other objects are cross-listed as both comets and numbered minor planets: 2060 Chiron (95P/Chiron), 4015 Wilson‚ÄìHarrington (107P/Wilson‚ÄìHarrington), 7968 Elst‚ÄìPizarro (133P/Elst‚ÄìPizarro), 118401 LINEAR (176P/LINEAR), (282P/2003 BM80), (288P/2006 VW139), and (362P/2008 GO98).Dual-Status Objects  Chunk  On 30 December 2005, when 13.1 AU from the Sun, a large chunk of Echeclus was observed to break off, causing a great cloud of dust. Astronomers have speculated this could have been caused by an impact or by an explosive release of volatile substances.  Outbursts  Echeclus appears to have outburst again around June 2011 when it was 8.5 AU from the Sun. On 24 June 2011, follow up imaging with the 2 meter Haleakala-Faulkes Telescope South showed the coma of Echeclus to be very close to the sky background limit. Echeclus outburst again around 7 December 2017 when it was 7.3 AU from the Sun, and was 4 magnitudes brighter than expected.33519 174P/Echeclus outburst (Brian Skiff)  Presence of gas  In 2016, carbon monoxide was detected in Echeclus in very small amounts, and the derived CO production rate was calculated to be sufficient to account for the observed coma. The calculated CO production rate from Echeclus is substantially lower than what is typically observed for 29P/Schwassmann‚ÄìWachmann, another distantly active comet often classified as a centaur.  Orbit  Echeclus came to perihelion in April 2015. Centaurs have short dynamical lives due to strong interactions with the giant planets. Echeclus is estimated to have an orbital half-life of about 610,000 years.

Early life and background Jimmy Claxton was born on December 14, 1892 in Wellington, British Columbia to American parents. Claxton's parents were 32-year-old William Edgar Claxton, a miner from Lynchburg, Virginia, and 18-year-old Emma Richards from Illinois. Claxton's mother had turned 18 just 24 days before the wedding, which was January 14, 1892. The Claxtons moved to Tacoma, Washington when Jimmy was three months old. The Claxton family was of a multiracial background, including people of black, Native American, French, Irish, and English ancestry. Jimmy and his siblings have been classified as white, black, and mulatto by various census-takers. Claxton's World War I draft registration card lists his race as Ethiopian. The minister officiating the marriage of Claxton's parents noted \\"The bridegroom is a coloured man; the bride a white woman\\" on the marriage record, which laid the groundwork for difficulties for Jimmy Claxton later. Baseball career Claxton began playing baseball at age thirteen, as a catcher for the town team of Roslyn, Washington. He later moved to pitcher. At age 18, he struck out eighteen players in a single game while pitching for a team from Chester, Washington. By 1916, Claxton had made his way to the Oakland, California, where he played for an all-black team. In Oakland, he came the attention of the management of the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. Claxton was introduced to the team owner by a part Native American friend as a fellow member of an Oklahoma tribe. At the time, African Americans were segregated in professional baseball, but Native Americans were allowed. On May 28, 1916, Claxton broke the professional baseball color line when he played two games for the Oaks. Claxton pitched in two games of a doubleheader for a combined total of two and one third innings. He allowed three runs, four hits, and four walks. The Zee-Nut candy company produced a baseball card for Claxton, making him the first African American baseball player to appear on a baseball card. Within a week, a friend of Claxton revealed that he had both African American and Native American ancestors, and Claxton was promptly fired. In an interview with the Contra Costa Times in 1964, Claxton explained that no reason was given for his dismissal, but he believed is was due to his race. Oaks manager Rowdy Elliott claimed that Claxton was released because of his performance. It was nearly thirty years before another black man played organized white baseball. After leaving the Oaks, Claxton played for Shasta Limited, an all-black semi- professional team based in northern California. While with the Shastas, he set a bush league record by striking out nineteen players in a single game. He won a state semi-professional championship while pitching with the Shastas. Claxton played for many different teams in the negro leagues, including the Chicago Union Giants and the Cuban Stars. He pitched his final game at age 63, during an old-timer's game in Tacoma, Washington. Claxton died on March 3, 1970 in Tacoma.

Prior to this, he served as the 8th Vice President of Liberia from 1870 to 1871 under President Edward James Roye and as Secretary of State from 1856 to 1860 in the cabinet of President Stephen Allen Benson. He was a member of the True Whig Party. Smith was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1825 to a family of free blacks. He arrived with his family in Liberia in 1833, and his parents died of malaria within a year. As a young man, he trained under Dr. James W. Lugenbeel, a medical doctor of the American Colonization Society. He then returned to the United States to study medicine at the University of Vermont College of Medicine. He transferred to Berkshire Medical College in Massachusetts, graduating with his medical degree in 1848. He was the second African American to receive a Doctor of Medicine from an American medical school, after David J. Peck a year earlier. After graduating, he returned to the newly independent Liberia to work as a physician. In 1855, Smith was elected to the Senate, representing Grand Bassa County. From 1856 to 1860, he was Secretary of State under President Stephen Allen Benson. In the 1869 presidential election, Smith was elected Vice President alongside President Edward James Roye. He and Roye were the first True Whig politicians to hold their respective offices. In 1871, after Roye was forced out of office, Smith served as president for the remainder of Roye's term. His two-month president remains the shortest in Liberian history. At the end of his presidential term, Smith returned home to Buchanan, and served as Superintendent of Grand Bassa County from 1874 to 1884. His son James Skivring Smith Jr. went on to serve as Vice President from 1930 to 1944.  Early life and education  Smith was born in Charleston, South Carolina on February 26, 1825, the fourth of seven children of free blacks Carlos and Catharine Smith. He and his family arrived in Liberia in 1833, and his parents died of malaria within one year of their arrival. After working with a white doctor of the American Colonization Society, Smith returned to the United States to study medicine at the University of Vermont College of Medicine. He transferred to the Berkshire Medical College in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, from which he received his medical degree in 1848. He was the second African American to graduate from a medical school in the United States, after David J. Peck, who graduated from Rush Medical College in 1847. He then returned to the newly independent Liberia, working for the ACS as a doctor.  Politics  Smith served as Secretary of State from 1856 to 1860 and was later elected as a senator from Grand Bassa County from 1868 to 1869. In the 1869 presidential election, Smith was elected vice president under President Edward James Roye. The two were the first True Whig politicians to hold their respective offices. On October 26, 1871, President Roye was forcibly removed from office after unconstitutionally extending his term, leading Smith to serve the remaining two months of Roye's term as president. Smith's tenure as president remains the shortest in Liberian history. After stepping down as president, Smith returned to Buchanan and served as Superintendent of Grand Bassa County from 1874 to 1884.Library of Congress website Smith's son, James Skivring Smith Jr., later became a successful politician in Liberia, also serving as Superintendent of Grand Bassa County and as vice president from 1930 to 1944.

From the 13th century, the ‚Äúrocca‚Äù or ‚Äúfortress‚Äù was the family‚Äôs palace; it is now the city hall after being acquired by the municipality in 1856. The theatre opened on 15 August 1868 and seats 300. Prior to 1856, a theatre existed in the same location, and while plans to build a new one were begun in 1845, nothing happened until the municipality took over. Designed by Pier Luigi Montecchini, the theatre is located on an upper level of the City Hall and is reached by a large staircase. Outside the theatre is a bust of Verdi by Giovanni Dupr√©. The interior is traditionally horseshoe-shaped with three rows of boxes and an elegantly designed ceiling featuring four medallions representing comedy, tragedy, melodrama, and romantic drama. Although Verdi opposed its construction (it would be ‚Äútoo expensive and useless in the future‚Äù, he said) and is reputed never to have set foot in it, he did contribute 10,000 lire towards the construction and maintained his own box. On opening night, operagoers dressed in green, the men all wearing green ties, the women wearing green dresses. Two Verdi operas were presented: Rigoletto and Un ballo in maschera. Verdi did not attend even though he lived only two miles away at his home, the Villa Verdi, in the village of Sant‚ÄôAgata in Villanova sull'Arda. In 1913, Arturo Toscanini conducted a performance of Falstaff in celebration of the centenary of Verdi‚Äôs birth and to raise funds for what is now a large monument of the seated composer located in the piazza. In 2001 the theatre re- painted the sets from 1913 for a revival; these were used again in October 2013 for a Verdi bi-centenary performance of Falstaff.Bottazzi, A. Review from Busseto. Opera, March 2014, Vol 65 No 3, p321. The theatre has been extensively renovated in the 1990s. It presents a regular season of opera performances.

History During the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, China captured samples of the Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifle, which it copied as the Type 79. Due to immature gunsmithing techniques its firing pin could break from metallurgy issues and problems copying the PSO-1 4x scope made it unable to handle the recoil of firing its rounds. These issues were addressed in the upgraded Type 85, but the PLA still used standard ball ammunition rather than specialized sniping cartridges, resulting in lower accuracy. These shortfalls led to development of a new sniper rifle when China started development of a new cartridge for machine guns in the early 1990s.Why China's Snipers Should Be Feared. The National Interest. 3 June 2018. The QBU-88 rifle (also sometimes referred to as Type 88 rifle) was the first weapon of the newest generation of Chinese small arms, chambered for proprietary 5.8√ó42mm DBP87 ammunition. Adopted in 1997, the QBU-88 is, by the modern sense, not a true sniper rifle ‚Äì it is more a designated marksman rifle, intended for aimed semi-automatic fire at ranges beyond the capabilities of standard infantry assault rifles. The rifle is intended for rough military use, so it is fitted with adjustable iron sights by default, and is generally equipped with telescopic sights or with night sights. QBU-88 rifle is optimized for a special heavy loading of 5.8√ó42mm cartridge with a longer streamlined bullet with steel core. It can also fire standard ammunition intended for the QBZ-95 assault rifles. At the present time the QBU-88 rifle is in service with PLA and Chinese police forces. Design details The QBU-88 rifle is a gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. It utilizes a short-stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and three-lug rotating bolt. The action is mounted in the compact steel receiver, and enclosed into a polymer bullpup-type housing. To increase accuracy, the action is mated to a 640 mm (25.1 in) long, hammer-forged match-grade barrel. The safety switch is located at the bottom of the receiver, just behind the magazine opening. The QBU-88 rifle is equipped with open, diopter-type adjustable sights, mounted on folding posts. It also has a short proprietary dovetail rail on the receiver which can accept telescope or night sight mounts. The rifle is intended to be utilized primarily with optics. The standard day optic used on the QBU-88 for military use is a Chinese 3-9√ó40 scope with an integral quick-release mount. In 2008 a new Chinese 6-24√ó44 tactical scope became available for counter-terrorism and other law enforcement use. The riflings for the QBU-88 differs from the standard QBZ-95 assault rifle. While the QBZ-95 has a twist to stabilize the standard 64-grain DBP-87 ball round, the QBU-88 has a faster twist to stabilize the 70-grain Heavy Ball round and dedicated Sniper load, similar to the QJY-88 general- purpose machine gun, which has progressive rifling with a final twist rate of 206 mm. A long birdcage flash suppressor is fitted to reduce the muzzle signature. A quick-detachable bipod is clamped to the barrel when required. Variants An export version called the KBU-97a is also produced and marketed for security forces of other foreign countries. This derivative utilizes 5.56√ó45mm NATO ammunition although, instead of STANAG magazine, a modified version of QBU-88 magazine is used to feed the rounds ‚Äì and STANAG magazines will not work unless modified. The KBU-97A has recently been sighted under the designation NQU03, though it is unknown if the two differentiate in any way aside from name.

She is named after the 19th century French cornet composer, Jean-Baptiste Arban who her father wrote his doctoral dissertation on. Arban is married to Steven Severin (former bassist/songwriter with Siouxsie and the Banshees and latterly film and theatre score composer) by whom she has had a son, Cage. (named after 20th-century American avant- garde composer, John Cage) Her maternal grandmother, Violette Newton, was named Poet Laureate of Texas in 1973, and is the author of several books, mostly poetry.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19621. Lyrics Modern versions of the rhyme include: :Tom, Tom, the piper's son, :Stole a pig, and away did run; :The pig was eat :And Tom was beat, :And Tom went crying [or \\"roaring\\", or \\"howling\\", in some versions] :Down the street.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 408-11. The 'pig' mentioned in the song is almost certainly not a live animal but rather a kind of pastry, often made with an apple filling, smaller than a pie. And the meaning of the rhyme involves a naughty boy named Tom whose father was a piper, and he steals the \\"pig\\", eats it, and after receiving a beating from his father (or someone else), Tom cries all the way down the street. Lyrics for \\"Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son\\" and illustrations show a boy stealing a pig and being stopped by the police, in The Baby's Opera A book of old Rhymes and The Music by the Earliest Masters, ca. 1877 Another version of the rhyme is: :Tom, Tom, the piper's son, :Stole a pig, and away he run. :Tom run here, :Tom run there, :Tom run through the village square. This rhyme is often conflated with a separate and longer rhyme: :Tom, he was a piper's son, :He learnt to play when he was young, :And all the tune that he could play :Was 'over the hills and far away'; :Over the hills and a great way off, :The wind shall blow my top-knot off. :Tom with his pipe made such a noise, :That he pleased both the girls and boys, :They all stopped to hear him play, :'Over the hills and far away'. :Tom with his pipe did play with such skill :That those who heard him could never keep still; :As soon as he played they began for to dance, :Even the pigs on their hind legs would after him prance. :As Dolly was milking her cow one day, :Tom took his pipe and began to play; :So Dolly and the cow danced 'The Cheshire Round', :Till the pail was broken and the milk ran on the ground. :He met old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs, :He used his pipe and she used her legs; :She danced about till the eggs were all broke, :She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke. :Tom saw a cross fellow was beating an ass, :Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass; :He took out his pipe and he played them a tune, :And the poor donkey's load was lightened full soon. Origins Both rhymes were first printed separately in a Tom the Piper's Son, a chapbook produced around 1795 in London, England. The origins of the shorter and better known rhyme are unknown. The second, longer rhyme was an adaptation of an existing verse which was current in England around the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries. The following verse, known as \\"The Distracted Jockey's Lamentations\\", may have been written for (but not included in) Thomas D'Urfey's play The Campaigners (1698): :Jockey was a Piper's Son, :And fell in love when he was young; :But all the Tunes that he could play, :Was, o'er the Hills, and far away, :And 'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away, :'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away, :'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away, :The Wind has blown my Plad away. This verse seems to have been adapted for a recruiting song designed to gain volunteers for the Duke of Marlborough's campaigns about 1705, with the title \\"The Recruiting Officer; or The Merry Volunteers\\", better today known as \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", in which the hero is called Tom.

While still a student, Logan enlisted in the Massachusetts 9th infantry during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Upon returning to Boston, he ran successfully for a seat on the Boston City Council in 1899, and subsequently won election to the Massachusetts state legislature as both a representative, and later as a state senator. Rising to the rank of major general following the First World War, he was given command of the 26th Infantry Division of the United States Army. Logan was instrumental in the post‚ÄìWorld War I reorganization of that unit, as well as the Massachusetts National Guard. He would go on to serve as head of the American Legion's Massachusetts division. General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, an international airport located in the East Boston neighborhood of Boston, is named after him. Biography Early years Logan was born in South Boston, Massachusetts, a son of Lawrence J. Logan and Catherine M. O'Connor.Edward Lawrence Logan, \\"Edward Lawrence Logan\\", in Harvard College Class of 1898 Quindecennial Report. n.c.: n.p., June 1913; pp. 200‚Äì201. He graduated from Boston Latin School and enrolled at Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1898. During his freshman year, he lived in Holworthy Hall, where his roommate was John Rankin McVey, an attorney and banker who became a powerful figure in the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Political career Logan's portrait as a state representative, during his time on the Committee on Metropolitan Affairs, 1902 In 1897, Logan enlisted in the 9th Infantry Regiment of the Massachusetts National Guard. He was quickly promoted through the ranks to sergeant major, and took part in combat in Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He returned to Boston in the fall of 1898 and enrolled at Harvard Law School. While still a law student, Logan won election to the Boston Common Council, on which he served from 1899 to 1900.

Military career Colonel Logan (second from left) and staff, on the way to the Western front, March 1918 Although Logan had resigned from the state militia in 1899, he rejoined in 1901, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 9th Infantry Regiment. He served in the 9th Regiment for the next 10 years and was promoted to first lieutenant and captain. In February 1911 he was promoted to major and in May 1912 to commander of the regiment with the rank of colonel. In March 1917, Logan's regiment was mobilized to guard installations in anticipation of the US declaration of war on Germany. After several months of guard duty, the 9th was federalized and re-designated as the 101st Infantry Regiment, part of the 26th Infantry Division, an National Guard organization created from the units of the New England states. Logan accompanied his troops to France in command of the 101st, and the regiment saw combat throughout the war.

It stars Adam West, Tia Carrere and Jon Mikl Thor, and it was filmed in the suburbs of Montreal, Canada. Plot Years ago, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, a little boy named Tony Washington (Jesse D'Angelo) cheers on his father William Washington (John Fasano)'s performance in a baseball game. On their way home, Tony, William, and William's wife Louise (Francesca Bonacorsa) see two teenagers preparing to rape a young girl (Tracy Biddle). William intervenes, rescuing the girl, but one of the would-be rapists fatally stabs him, leaving him to die as the two teens flee. In the film's present-day, Tony (Jon Mikl Thor), now a musclebound teenage baseball player, disrupts an attempted robbery at a neighborhood grocery store. As he steps into the street, he is struck dead by a car carrying a gang of reckless teenagers: Bob (Allan Fisler), Amy (Tia Carrere), Jim (Shawn Levy), Peter (Hamish McEwan), and Susie (Manon E. Turbide). The carful of teens flees the scene, and neighbors carry Tony's corpse to his home, where his mother Louise mourns for him. She contacts Molly Mekembe, the girl whom William rescued years ago, now a local voodoo priestess (Manuska Rigaud), in hope that voodoo can save her son. While Molly is unable to restore Tony to life, she can revive him long enough to allow him to avenge his own death. After Louise agrees, Molly resurrects Tony as a zombie, then uses her powers to aid him in his revenge by guiding him to the guilty teenagers. The next night, Tony, as a zombie, tracks Peter and Susie to an academy gymnasium and fatally breaks Peter's neck, then kills Susie by crushing her skull with a baseball bat. The night afterwards, he is able to find and kill Jim by impaling him with the same bat before the latter could rape a waitress. Police detective Frank Sorrell (Frank Dietz) is soon investigating both incidents and initially agrees with the coroner that a large built, drug-fueled man is responsible. Sorrell brings his suspicions to his boss, police captain Tom Churchman (Adam West) and is told that they have already managed to find a suspect responsible that matches Sorrell's description, closing the case. Believing that the case has not been truly solved, Sorrell investigates photos that place Molly at both incidents and suggests to Churchman that they bring her in for questioning. However the captain dismisses her as a \\"batty, voodoo palm reader that follows ambulances around\\" and sends him home to rest. Shortly afterwards, Churchman contacts Jim's father Fred, and informs him of Molly's involvement in his son's death, then tells him to come to the police station. As Fred tries to leave his home, he sees Tony approaching him and shoots him with a rifle. Tony quickly recovers and breaks Fred's neck, killing him. Knowing that they will be next, Bob and Amy decide to leave town. While at a garage getting money, Tony finds them and kills Bob by bashing his head against a car, then does the same to Amy against a door. While monitoring Tony's actions, Churchman abducts Molly at gunpoint and forces her to show him where Tony is going. Sorrell follows the zombie to a cemetery. Molly and Churchman soon arrive, with both telling Sorrell that the priestess resurrected Tony to not only avenge himself, but also to avenge Molly, as Churchman and Fred were the two that tried to rape her years ago, and Churchman was the one who had killed Tony's father. Molly begins a spell, but having learned that a revived zombie's power fades once it has achieved its goal, Churchman shoots Tony, ending his zombie existence, then shoots and kills Molly as well. Before he is able to shoot Sorrell, silencing him as a witness, a second zombie rises out of a nearby grave and drags the still-living Churchman into the ground with him, presumably to Hell. A shocked Sorrell inspects the grave and learns that the second zombie was Tony's father William Washington, avenging his own death years before at Churchman's hands, then departs. Cast Production Thor plays the zombie, and wrote much of the incidental music. This includes heavy metal riffs by his band, and synthesizer music played by the band Thorkestra. Several other heavy metal bands contribute to the soundtrack. The Mot√∂rhead hit \\"Ace of Spades\\" plays during the opening credits. Other bands heard on the soundtrack include Virgin Steele, Girlschool, Fist, and Death Mask, as well as a track by Thor's then wife and back up singer \\"Pantera\\" (not the band).

Haney (born August 22, 1952) is a retired member of the United States Army counterterrorist unit, the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment- Delta (1SFOD-D), more commonly known as Delta Force. In recent years he has been writing on terrorism, guerrilla warfare, and special operations. Haney is the author of Inside Delta Force, a memoir of his time in the elite unit, in which he also writes about his participation in the aborted 1980 Operation Eagle Claw mission to Iran to free American hostages. He was a co-executive producer of the CBS television series The Unit, created by David Mamet and inspired by Haney's special operations experiences. Previously, Haney was a technical consultant on Mamet's 2004 film Spartan, starring Val Kilmer. Early life and education Haney was born on August 22, 1952 and raised in rural Lindale, Georgia, just outside the town of Rome. He graduated from Pepperell High School in 1970. Military career Haney joined the Army just out of high school in 1970 and became a platoon sergeant by the time he was 22. He served for several years in the 75th Ranger Regiment as an infantryman and was slated to become an instructor. In 1977 he volunteered for and was selected to train with a new elite counter-terrorism unit that the Army was creating. Of the 163 soldiers that tried out, Haney was one of only 12 to succeed. This unit became operational in 1978 as the 1st SFOD-D, or Delta Force, with Haney joining the unit at least 13 months later; following further training and operational acceptance nearly six months after that he became a full member of the unit. The unit had been formed and organized by Colonel Charles Beckwith approximately 19 months before Haney became an asset and operator with the unit. Haney served in the unit until 1986, participating in a number of special operations in Latin America and the Middle East. After his promotion to Command Sergeant Major, the rank he held until his retirement in 1990, Haney left Delta and joined the 193rd Infantry Brigade in Panama. Iran ‚Äì Operation: \\"Eagle Claw\\" In 1980, the United States launched Operation Eagle Claw, an attempt to end the Iran hostage crisis with a commando raid. Haney was one of the Delta operators who took part. He was inside a parked C-130 tanker/transport aircraft that caught fire and exploded when a Navy RH-53D helicopter piloted by a Marine aircrew collided with it after the mission had been aborted and the unit was preparing to extricate. After the debacle, he and other Delta operators were told to \\"take a vacation\\" in order to avoid media scrutiny. Honduras In 1981, Haney and two Delta Force operators were deployed to Honduras to train Honduran Special Forces. They were sent on a mission to intercept and destroy a force of Honduran communist guerrillas that had infiltrated from Nicaragua. The 100 or so rebels allegedly were being led by an advisor from the Nicaraguan Sandinista Army. Haney wrote that his team, composed of Delta operators and Honduran special forces soldiers, tracked the guerrillas to a mountain sanctuary in the jungle. During an assault on the hilltop, Haney noticed a guerrilla using a radio. Taking him for the leader, he shot and killed him. Haney later discovered the man was David Arturo B√°ez, a Nicaraguan-born U.S. citizen and former Army Special Forces soldier Haney had met during his Delta selection tests. In his memoir, Haney questioned whether B√°ez had joined the Sandinistas or was working for the United States as a CIA operative up until his death. (B√°ez is referred to in Haney's book as \\"Enrique 'Keekee' S√°enz.\\") Several former Delta members who were there, including his Squadron Commander, have disputed the incident and stated it is a fabrication. However, in an interview published in the Miami Herald, Baez's family said they heard accounts of his death which resemble those described in the book. Beirut During the 1982 Marines operation in Lebanon, Haney was deployed with other Delta Force members to train local Lebanese as part of the U.S. Embassy security detail. Later, he and his teammates were tasked with locating and eliminating snipers who were targeting U.S. Marines deployed as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Grenada ‚Äì Operation: \\"Urgent Fury\\" In 1983, during the U.S. invasion of Grenada in Operation Urgent Fury, Haney and other Delta operators were assigned to raid a prison thought to hold political prisoners. Their helicopters came under heavy enemy fire, and they discovered the prison was empty. The raid was called off. Panama ‚Äì Operation: \\"Just Cause\\" In 1989, the U.S. invaded the Republic of Panama in Operation Just Cause. Haney was Command Sergeant Major of the 193rd Infantry Brigade. He was involved in a fire fight along with C Co. 5/87th Inf. (Light) \\"Panthers\\", 193rd Inf. Brigade, in which Panamanian forces attempted to assassinate newly elected Panamanian Vice President Ford. Panamanian forces suffered heavy losses, while no U.S. soldiers were killed. This took place at the DNTT (Direccion Nacional de Transporte Terrestre), which served as the Headquarters of the National Police. Book criticism Since the publication of Inside Delta Force in 2002 and Haney's subsequent success with The Unit television show, three of his former Delta colleagues accused him of embellishing his accomplishments within the unit and fabricating several of the events depicted. Criticism includes Haney's claim that he was a \\"founding member\\" of Delta Force as others former members consider there was only one \\"founder\\", Colonel Charlie Beckwith, who helped establish the unit and was its first commanding officer. One such colleague, Logan Fitch, who first wrote publicly of the Desert One mission for Penthouse Magazine in 1984, called Haney a \\"crass opportunist\\" for capitalizing on his past for personal gain. Haney maintains the accuracy of his book. Another member criticized Haney for revealing too much about Delta Force's training, tactics and early missions. A U.S. Army historian has questioned whether this was an issue, given that the information contained in Haney's book was current during the late-1970s and early-1980s and that Delta Force would certainly have changed their procedures since then. Moreover, operational information offered by Delta veterans had been made public before, for instance in Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden's book about the Battle of Mogadishu, and most notably in Delta Force: The Army's Elite Counterterrorist Unit, Beckwith's own account about the formation and training of the unit. Post-military career After retiring from the Army in 1990, Haney was employed as a freelance security consultant and trainer. He worked within the United States and abroad as a bodyguard, trainer for military and police forces, and private kidnap rescuer. Some of Haney's assignments in the private sector include conducting the ransom negotiation and ransom hand-over for a kidnapped oil executive in Colombia, and helping governments in two Middle Eastern countries develop their special forces capabilities. He also worked for several years as personal security detail leader for several high-profile clients, such as Saudi Prince Khalid al Faisal and Haitian President Jean- Bertrand Aristide upon his return from exile in 1994. During the 1990s, Haney undertook security consulting work in Algeria on a gas pipeline project, and started a contract aviation company in Liberia. Some time later, Haney was approached about organizing and leading a coup attempt in another African nation. He claims to have subsequently thwarted the coup. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Haney became a regular television commentator on military affairs and terrorism, appearing on CNN, Fox News, CBS News, The O'Reilly Factor and MSNBC. He has expressed opinions strongly critical of the planning and implementation of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Haney was the host of a television series entitled \\"Spymaster USA,\\" which aired on The Learning Channel in 2004. Haney was involved as a writer, producer, and technical advisor for the CBS television series The Unit, loosely based on his book. Haney also made a cameo appearance on the show as an Army recruiting officer. Haney made a cameo appearance in the 2010 film Iron Man 2 portraying USAF commanding officer, General Meade. In the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops a portrait of Haney can be found on the wall during the campaign mission which takes place inside of the Pentagon, as well as the zombie-mode map \\"Five\\" (which is also based on the Pentagon). He is cited as a dialogue consultant in the credits. Bibliography * Inside Delta Force (2002), * Beyond Shock and Awe: Warfare in the 21st Century (2006) (ed., with Brian M.

Biography Rath was born in Klein-W√ºlknitz, Anhalt, and came from an old noble family. His parents were Hans von Rath and Anna Voigt Rath. Rath enjoyed a Protestant education and was registered at the University of Leipzig starting the summer of 1601. But he eventually left academia for a career in the military, the high point of which was Rath's appointment as the kriegskommissar, the officer appointed to handle financial matters under Prince Ludwig I of Anhalt-K√∂then. Rath was married to Dorothea von Hackeborn, who bore him a son, Balthasar Wilhelm von Rath, in 1629. In the service of Ludwig I throughout the Thirty Years' War until his death, he was appointed commander of the cavalry (January 10, 1627). In recognition of his military professionalism, Ludwig called him ‚Äúrough‚Äù and ‚Äútough‚Äù when admitting him to the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, a society dedicated to the standardization of German. Rath distinguished himself with his cavalry at the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) in the Swedish-Protestant victory against the Imperial Catholic troops. He was known for his battle cry, an earlier and more poetic version of ‚ÄúWhen things get tough, the tough get going\\": :Wan das rauhe ist dahin :So die iugent mit sich bringet: :Endert sich der gantze sinn, :Und dan nach dem himmel ringet.

The significance of the Teletouch systems lies in its conception, design and symbolism for American automobiles produced in the 1950s, and the gadgets designed into them. The main distinguishing feature of the system was its use of push buttons on the steering wheel to shift gears as opposed to a gear stick. Conception Edsel Ranger interior, showing the Teletouch system. Conception of the Edsel began in the early 1950s when Ford Motor Company attempted to outflank industry leader General Motors through altering its production, pricing and its make and model ranges. One of the results of this plan was the E-car program that resulted in the ill-fated Edsel. From the beginning, the Edsel was promised to be something very different from the cars that Detroit was turning out at the time. However development costs required that Edsel share the basics of other established Ford brands on the market. In this climate, the Edsel emerged as a five-model, three-wheelbase automobile line. Senior Edsels would share their chassis with Mercury, junior models would share their chassis with Ford passenger vehicles, and station wagons would share their chassis and body structure with Ford's station range. The distinction offered by the Edsel, therefore, was in the styling details. While the famed 'horse collar' grille and 'boomerang' tail lights made the Edsel visually unique, the Teletouch transmission and saucer- like spinning speedometer emerged as two of the better-remembered interior details. Design The first electrical gear shift mechanism sold on new automobiles was the Vulcan electric gear shift system, a solenoid-driven transmission shift device for a standard sliding gear gearbox introduced in the summer of 1913. Among the automakers to offer the Vulcan system were the Haynes Automobile Company of Kokomo, Indiana the S.G.V. Company of Reading, Pennsylvania and the Norwalk Motor Car Company of Martinsburg, West Virginia. While the Vulcan shifter was often advertised as standard equipment on the Haynes car, a common floor shift was also available for $200 less. Norwalk made the Vulcan system available on their products, such as the Underslung Six, as an option; approximately 25 of those cars were so equipped. A large nickel-plated box was attached to the right side of the steering column which housed the push button mechanism. It utilized six buttons ‚Äì first through third gear, reverse, neutral and park. There was also a \\"signal\\" button which was the horn. A housing containing four large solenoids was mounted at the transmission which acted on the steel transmission shift control rods. The driver was free to select any gear at will, enabling the bypassing of gears, such as jumping from first to third gear without going through second gear. There was a cautionary advisory with the car that one must use care when placing the selector into reverse, only doing so when the car was completely stopped. Pushing a button on the shift control preselected the chosen gear. The electrical circuit was closed only after the driver fully depressed the clutch pedal. This energized the appropriate transmission mounted solenoids necessary for returning the transmission to neutral and then completing engagement of the preselected gear; the driver would then release the clutch pedal to continue onwards. These seemed to have been very advanced automotive systems. The Vulcan Electric Shift Company was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was eventually bought out by Cutler-Hammer. The model year 1914 was the only year that Norwalk used this system. Only one known Norwalk Motor Car survives today, which is owned by the friends of the Norwalk Foundation, Inc. in Martinsburg. Haynes was evidently the only automaker of note to place the push-buttons in the center of the steering wheel. The Vulcan electric gear shift system probably didn't survive past the early 1920s, since nothing regarding it has been found in the automotive engineering literature past 1921, and a 1919 Haynes print ad has been found with no mention of the electric shifting system. Chrysler Corporation automobiles introduced pushbutton automatic transmission controls for their PowerFlite and Torqueflite transmissions for the 1956 model year. Instead of the traditional placement of a gear selector on the column, Chrysler's system mounted the gear buttons in dashboard pods to the left of the steering wheel, becoming the first U.S. carmaker to offer such a system. This system was mechanical. Packard also introduced a steering-column-mounted electro-mechanical pushbutton transmission control pod in its \\"Touch Button Ultramatic\\" in 1956, placed off to the right of the column about . Using technology that it purchased from a Packard supplier, Auto-Lite, this push-button system proved problematic as the electric motor was insufficient to move the car out of Park on a steep hill, and would pop the circuit breaker; electrical contact problems, wiring problems and other issues were prevalent even when new; and the problems worsened with age. The Mercury Division of Ford Motor Company (later, in 1957, the Lincoln-Mercury Division), followed suit with its purely mechanical push-button transmission control system in 1957. When the 1958 Edsel launched in the late summer of 1957, the Edsel became the first and only Ford division to launch an electro-mechanical push-button transmission system, which it trademarked as Teletouch. Teletouch placed the transmission buttons in a ring within the center of the steering wheel. Edsel's marketing department promoted the Teletouch as a logical progression in the process of making the steering wheel the central command center for controlling cars. Marketing also pointed out that more of the dashboard view was unrestricted to the driver with the gear handle removed. Edsel even issued a Teletouch \\"face- mask\\" for dealers to wear and pass out as an advertising premium promoting the system to would-be buyers. While a standard gear selector was available as a reduced-cost option for the automatic transmission on the Edsel Ranger, Pacer and station wagon models, Corsair and Citation models came standard with Teletouch. Execution In theory, the idea of the Teletouch system made sense, but in its execution, the system quickly became the bane of the Edsel and its owners. Many new car buyers, and most automotive writers, found Teletouch to be a gimmick, while others found it distracting or confusing. Despite its marketing talking points, it required the driver to remove a hand from the steering wheel rim to push a center-pod button. Reliability proved poor due to the servo motor's hot, wet and dirty operating environment between the bell housing and the exhaust pipe just above the road surface, and the somewhat troublesome associated relays, switches, wiring and connectors. On the other hand, the wiring inside the steering column did not move and was extremely reliable, since the pod containing the buttons did not turn with the wheel. The electric control current flowed through a set of slip rings and brush contacts, while the Teletouch buttons were held in the correct position with Neutral at 12 o'clock through a set of planetary gears in the steering column. The steering wheel was directly coupled to the steering linkage as with conventional steering columns. Eventually, all push-button transmission selectors became a safety issue due to lack of industry-wide standardization. In addition, since the 1920s the center of the steering wheel had typically held the horn button. While some cars of the late 50s had horn rings, some drivers instinctively hit the steering wheel center in an emergency, sometimes causing them to either damage the controls or cause an unexpected, hazardous gear change (occasionally causing transmission damage). The Edsel's system included an electro-hydraulic inhibitor switch activated by transmission fluid pressure which virtually eliminated the possibility of this happening. The single circumstance under which a Teletouch could be put into gear with the car moving at greater than three to five miles per hour was if the neutral button was depressed first, thereby removing hydraulic pressure from the inhibitor switch, and then the reverse or park button pushed. These actions would, as a result, either shear off the parking pawl or suddenly set the rear wheels turning in the reverse direction, effectively locking them up against the road surface and possibly damaging the reverse bands in the transmission. Ironically, the failed Autolite Packard system protected against this set of circumstances by locking out not only reverse and park, but also neutral while the car was moving with any significant speed. For the 1959 model year, Edsel dropped Teletouch as an option, and began the process of abandoning the automotive market by dropping its Mercury-based cars, and eliminating the Citation, and Pacer cars as well as the Bermuda and Roundup station wagons. Steering wheel-mounted transmission controls have made a comeback since the mid-1990s introduction of Porsche's Tiptronic system, although the controls for the selection of park, reverse, and neutral are almost always located elsewhere. They also invariably have the buttons or \\"paddles\\" for the functions that are on the steering wheel quite near the rim, for true \\"both- hands-on-the-wheel\\" functionality.

Coolant holes in tip and base of gun drill. Gun drills are straight fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow body to the cutting face. They are used for deep drilling‚Äîa depth-to-diameter ratio of 300:1 or more is possible. Gun barrels are the obvious example; hence the name. Other uses include moldmaking, diemaking, and the manufacture of combustion engine parts such as crankcase, cylinder head, and woodwind musical instruments, such as uilleann pipes, as gun drills can drill long straight holes in metal, wood, and some plastics. The coolant provides lubrication and cooling to the cutting edges and removes the swarf or chips from the hole. Modern gun drills use carbide tips to prolong life and reduce total cost when compared with steel tips. Speed of drilling depends on the material being drilled, rotational speed, and the drill diameter; a high speed drill can cut a hole in P20 steel at 30 inches per minute. Gun drilling can be done on several kinds of machine tools. On lathes, it is generally practical with hole depths of less than 50 diameters. There are also purpose- built gun drilling machines, where longer aspect ratios can be drilled. Requirement With a standard twist drill, it is difficult to drill a straight and accurately sized hole of a depth more than about 5 times the diameter. This is a problem in many manufacturing processes, especially the firearms industry: the barrel of a gun must be very straight and accurately sized. Gun barrels are far longer than their inside diameter; as an example, the caliber barrel of the M16 rifle is long, nearly 90 times the diameter of the bore. The gun drill was developed to drill such long, straight holes. Gun drilling is possible over a range of depths and diameters. For diameters between , gun drilling can be performed successfully with special equipment. It is a common process between in diameter. It is also possible for the range, however less efficient than BTA deep hole drilling. Types A gun drilling machine drilling holes in steel. There are three basic types of deep hole drilling. Processes are categorized by how the cutting coolant flushes heat and chips from the cutting face. The three types of deep drilling are: * Gun drilling - The cutting tool is a fluted solid rod that has a hole bored down the center. Coolant is pumped through a hole in the inside of the drill. It flows back outside the drill, through the flute, bringing the chips with it. * BTA / STS (Boring and Trepanning Association / Single Tube System) - The cutting tool is a tube. Coolant is pumped in around the outside of the cutting tool and carries chips out through the center tube. For the tube to be strong enough and have an inner diameter large enough to carry chips away, the hole must be more than in diameter. * Ejector system - The cutting tool is a tube with another tube nested inside. Coolant flows through the smaller tube to the cutting face and then coolant and chips flow back through the larger tube. This is only an acceptable technology for holes of over in diameter.

For fifteen years, she was a spokesmodel for the cosmetics company Estee Lauder, Inc. Early years Karen Graham was born in Gulfport, Mississippi in 1945. After studying French at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, she moved to New York City to pursue a career as a French-language high school teacher. In 1969, however, her life was changed forever when she shopped at the Bonwit Teller store in Manhattan one day. Becoming impatient waiting for the down elevator, she took the stairs instead, where she met modeling agency owner Eileen Ford. As Graham remembered in a 1999 interview, she had started chatting with Mrs Ford on the stairs, and by the time they were outside, Mrs Ford handed Graham her card and suggested that she think about becoming a model. Because Graham had not found a teaching job yet and was working as a bookkeeper, she decided to try modeling for a few years to make extra money to furnish her small apartment. Graham's early work as a model included a photo shoot for Irving Penn, who found her to have a lovely look and was interested in photographing her for Vogue. Diana Vreeland, then the magazine's editor-in- chief, found her too small, but reluctantly agreed after Penn persisted. Graham first appeared in Vogue in 1970, and suddenly found herself in greater demand when Grace Mirabella replaced Vreeland as editor-in-chief. Between 1970 and 1975, Graham would appear on the magazine's cover twenty times. The \\"Estee Lauder Woman\\" (1970-1985) Her status as a legendary model was set, however, with the Estee Lauder advertising campaign. The company began employing her intermittently in 1970 and 1971 to appear in their print ads, and she worked with Chicago photographer Victor Skrebneski. She was employed so frequently that by 1973, she became Estee Lauder's exclusive spokesmodel. It was a job she would do for the rest of the decade, appearing in print and television ads that presented her in tasteful, elegant, generously appointed tableaux - a parlor, a drawing room, a veranda - to represent the high-class image the Estee Lauder company created for itself. In these ads, Graham was never identified by name, which Estee Lauder herself frankly admitted was deliberate. Mrs. Lauder did not want to dilute attention on the product by focusing more attention on the model in the ads. Many people, unfamiliar with the fashion and modeling world, thought Graham was, in fact, Mrs. Lauder. Ironically, the ads were a reflection of Mrs. Lauder's own idea of a woman of taste and sophistication. Skrebneski was happy to oblige, decorating his sets with Chinese vases, Pablo Picasso ceramics, and well-stocked bookshelves. Because the Lauder company aimed its products at upper-income women, at expensive prices, the ads had to project luxury. Various props were used - dolls, horses, and, curiously, a framed photograph of Nicholas II, the last czar of Russia, in a 1981 ad. The ad campaigns were mainly meant to project traditional, Old World elegance. A stunning exception was an ad campaign for the Lauder company's \\"Swiss age-controlling skincare program,\\" in which Skrebneski photographed Graham standing among edged cylinders in a futuristic tableau and wearing her hair back, adorned with what looked like a plastic stereo headset and worn as if it were a space-age tiara. Personal life Karen Graham inevitably gained attention from many men, including Delbert Coleman, a tycoon who ran the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was known for his controversial financial deals. He married Graham in 1974, but the marriage did not last long. Far more successful was a romance with British television icon David Frost but, bowing to familial pressure, she returned to Mississippi. It was there she rekindled her relationship with Sam Mavar. They had a son named Graham, after Karen's maiden name. Karen Graham was joined by model Shaun Casey in the Estee Lauder campaign in 1981, and for the next four years the Lauder company was thus represented by two spokesmodels. Graham quit in 1985, when she turned 40; as she told People magazine in 2000, she decided to leave modeling while she was still on top. Casey only briefly appeared in magazine advertisements before being fired and replaced with future news anchorwoman Willow Bay. Fly fishing and more modeling Graham remained in New York City for another six years before she moved to Rosendale, New York, where she pursued her favorite hobby, fly fishing. She had taken up the sport in the seventies after her brother had given everyone in her family a fly rod. Her passion for fly fishing led to a second career as a fly-fishing school operator and instructor, when she co-founded, with veteran fisherman Bert Darrow, Fly Fishing With Bert and Karen. The school offers two-day instructional courses, and furnishes all equipment. In 1999, she returned to modeling for Estee Lauder's \\"Resilience Lift\\" face cream, aimed at older women and designed to help female skin reproduce the skin nutrients that prevent wrinkles. Graham was happy to return to modeling for the campaign, which lasted for a few years, and Victor Skrebneski returned to shoot the print ads for the Lauder company after leaving in 1993. Graham also did a few seasons of ESPN2's fishing series \\"In Search of Fly Water,\\" and now lives in the foothills of North Carolina. In addition to fly fishing, she takes a great interest in horseback riding.

Possible planetary system  In 2003 and 2004, an object (now catalogued as AB Pictoris b) was observed close to the star by a team of astronomers at the European Southern Observatory. Since it had common proper motion with AB Pictoris, it was concluded that it was physically close to the star. Its spectral type was estimated as between L0V and L3V. Using evolutionary models, its mass was estimated as from 13 to 14 Jupiter masses.A companion to AB Pic at the planet/brown dwarf boundary, G. Chauvin, A.-M. Lagrange, B. Zuckerman, C. Dumas, D.

In 2000, he and his ensemble won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album for their work on the Concord Picante album Latin Soul. Sanchez has performed with artists including Cal Tjader, Mongo Santamar√≠a, Hugh Masekela, Clare Fischer, and Tower of Power. Early life The youngest of eleven children, Poncho Sanchez was born in Laredo, Texas and reared in Norwalk, California. Growing up, he was exposed to and influenced by two different styles of music: Afro-Cuban music (mambo, son, cha-cha, rumba, guaracha, and Changui) by Tito Puente and others, and bebop jazz, including the works of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Originally a guitarist, he discovered his talent for singing during an audition for the R&B; band The Halos that rehearsed across the street from his residence. Sanchez became the lead vocalist of The Halos, and would go on to teach himself the flute, the drums, and timbales before finally deciding in high school to pursue conga drumming above all. Sanchez has released dozens of LP and CD albums. Career In 1975, Sanchez's idol, vibraphonist Cal Tjader, invited him to perform a set with his band. Seeing the young man's talent, Tjader hired Sanchez for a week before officially making him a full member of the ensemble. Sanchez played a crucial role as conguero for several years until Tjader's death in 1982. Before he died, Tjader suggested that Concord Records founder Carl Jefferson sign Sanchez and his soon-to-be-formed group under the Concord Picante label. Tjader's wishes were honored, and the first two records were composed and arranged by long-time Tjader collaborator Clare Fischer. Sanchez went on to produce 19 albums for the label, eventually garnering a Grammy for his work. AllMusic described Sanchez as \\"among the most influential percussionists in jazz.\\" He has been performing frequently in venues varying in size from concert halls to local jazz festivals. His 2005 CD, Do It!, features the funk band Tower of Power on two tracks, as well as South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. Sanchez is a frequent collaborator with bandleader Jos√© Rizo. He played conga on the Grammy-nominated album Mongorama produced by Rizo. Sanchez was featured on Ilya Serov's single \\"Tangerine\\", released on January 9, 2018.

The film was directed by Walter Hill, with a screenplay by Harry Kleiner and Deric Washburn (the latter collaborated with Michael Cimino on Silent Running and The Deer Hunter) from a story by John Milius and Fred Rexer Extreme Prejudice is an homage, of sorts, to The Wild Bunch, a western directed by Sam Peckinpah, with whom Hill worked on The Getaway. Both films end with a massive gunfight in a Mexican border town. The title originates from \\"terminate with extreme prejudice\\", a phrase popularized by Apocalypse Now, also written by Milius. The lead character of Jack Benteen (Nolte) was loosely based on Joaquin Jackson. Nolte spent three weeks in Texas with Jackson learning the day-to-day activities of a Ranger. Nolte took what he learned and incorporated it into his character's the mannerisms and dress. Plot A teletype message flashes across the screen ... : Master Sergeant Larry McRose (Clancy Brown), U.S. Army, Frankfurt, West Germany : Report to Zombie Unit, El Paso, Texas At the airport in El Paso, Texas, five U.S. Army sergeants meet up with Major Paul Hackett (Michael Ironside), the leader of the clandestine Zombie Unit, composed of soldiers reported to be killed-in-action and on temporary assignment under Hackett for the duration of a secret mission. Jack Benteen (Nick Nolte) is a tough Texas Ranger. His best friend from high school is Cash Bailey (Powers Boothe), a former police informer who has crossed into Mexico and became a major drug trafficker. Bailey tries to bribe Benteen to look the other way while sending major drug shipments to the U.S. When Benteen refuses, he is left with a warning by Bailey: Look the other way, or die trying. Benteen and his friend, Sheriff Hank Pearson (Rip Torn), end up getting in a shootout with Bailey's men at a gas station outside of town, resulting in Pearson's death. Benteen infers that Bailey set them up. Two of Bailey's men try to escape, but Hackett has them killed by not leaving any witnesses, and after they tried to steal his vehicle. Accompanied by a DEA agent, the Zombie Unit arrives in town tracking Bailey. When they attempt to rob a local bank, one soldier is killed and two others are caught and detained by Benteen. After realizing the men are listed as dead in all official records, Benteen is confronted by the D.E.A. agent spearheading the operation, who tells them him they were robbing the bank in order to get Bailey's money and a safety deposit box containing accounts on all the drug money he's deposited there. Now knowing the full story, Benteen joins with the soldiers and crosses the border into Mexico to track down Bailey and end his drug running. At Bailey's hacienda, they are joined by Benteen's girlfriend Sarita (Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso), who was once Bailey's woman and has followed Benteen into Mexico. At an Independence Day festival, Benteen confronts Bailey while the soldiers attack Bailey's private army. Hackett is witnessed shooting Bailey's accountant and, at the same time, reveals himself to be Bailey's partner, telling one of his men there was no mission, and that they were assigned to die. The town erupts into a gunfight, which few but Benteen and Sarita survive. Hackett and his men get killed in the process. Benteen and Bailey end up in an old west-style showdown, which results in Bailey getting shot to death, rather than surrender. Bailey's right-hand man, Lupo, takes over the drug business and tells Benteen he'll do him a favor some day, while Benteen and Sarita walk away towards an uncertain future.

Production John Milius The film was first announced for production in 1976 with Milius to direct from his own script. \\"It's very complicated\\", said Milius. \\"I've never been able to put what the movie's about in a few words. All I can say is it's a modern-day story about subversion and espionage.\\" He elaborated in a 1976 interview saying it was \\"about Special Forces. It's a rightwing political thriller, a rightwing Costa-Gavras film. It takes place in Texas and involves the Texas Rangers as well. I shouldn't talk about it.\\" However he did describe one scene: > There's an operation carried out with peak efficiency where four highly > trained specialists wipe out forty men. They don't wipe them out in the > usual sense, because they're so good and heroic. I wanted to give the sense > that these four are more than a match for forty because they're so skilled > at what they do: use of explosives, automatic weapons fire, interlocking > fields of fire. Their planning is so precise and perfect: they're used to > thinking this way. When you come away from this battle, you're not just > impressed with their skill, but also with how cold they are. Ruthlessly > efficient. He also said there was a line in the film \\"where a Ranger is talking about being in a gunfight with people in a car and the other guy says, \\"That gun won't stop a car\\", and the Ranger says, \\"It will if you shoot it in the driver.\\" That's a Milius line. I'm trying to get away from that; the rest of the script is very flat. I'm trying to write more mundane now. Rather than dazzle constantly, I'm trying to let the weight of the story carry it, and the more subtle implications of it, letting scenes play themselves out the way they would in reality. We'll see what happens. It's a definite development.\\" In an interview for the July, 1978, issue of \\"Crawdaddy\\" magazine, Milius spoke about the film as a future project, giving away the original ending. \\"A group of drug dealers take over a town in Texas, then finally one person, a Vietnam veteran, stands up to them and wipes them out. Then we cut to a meeting room at the Pentagon, where we find out it was all a top secret experiment to find out how far Americans can be pushed before they fight back.\\" The film was to be made in October 1976 in Texas, but Milius instead decided to make Big Wednesday. Development In 1982 the project was in the hands of Walter Hill. He assigned Larry Gross to do some work on the script before the latter did work on 48 Hours. In 1983 it was reported that Carolco Pictures, then flush with money from the success of First Blood, had purchased the script from Warner Bros and were hoping for Ted Kotcheff to direct. Milius was reportedly rewriting the script to bring it up to date. In 1985 Jonathan Demme was linked to the project. Then Carolco signed Walter Hill to direct and he hired Harry Kleiner to rewrite the film. Hill had known Kleiner from the film Bullitt, on which Hill was an assistant director and Kleiner the writer; Hill was impressed by Kleiner's talent for writing and rewriting on the set daily, which he needed for this film. Casting The lead role was played by Nick Nolte with whom Hill had made 48 Hours. Hill: > I wanted someone who was representative of the tradition of the American > West -- taciturn, stoical, enduring. Someone who carried a lot of pain with > him. I told Nick, 'The kind of thing I'm talking about is Cooperesque.' I > had him look at a lot of Gary Cooper films.\\"Nick Nolte Far From Down, Out\\" > by Glenn Lovell, Orlando Sentinel April 29, 1987 accessed 6 February 2015 Nick Nolte said the role made a change of pace for him: > It was a chance to play a morally perfect character. Like Walter said, we > spent a lot of time looking at old films to get this Old West flavor. We > looked at Wayne films, at Cooper films, at Randolph Scott films. Yeah, > there's a lot of High Noon in this movie. There's a lot of Howard Hawks > director of Red River. There's a lot of Sam Peckinpah ... I needed to find > the demeanor of how those '40s characters carried themselves -- how they > dressed and carried their guns. Nolte got writer friend Peter Gent who had written North Dallas Forty to recommend a real-life Texas Ranger to act as a model for his character. Gent suggested veteran Ranger Joaquin Jackson. Jackson later said he: > More or less edited the script with Nick. We got more into the type of > language Rangers use, as well as the Rangers' relationship with other law > enforcement agencies -- the federal narcotics people, FBI, etc. What I'm > trying to get back to the press is that it all relates back to narcotics. Nolte concurred: > This film is kind of about the drug wars. Walter and I wanted to do a story > about the distribution of drugs, not in the city, but across the border. > There's two points of view about this drug situation in America. One is > educational, and the other has to do with the prevalence of drugs, the > availability of them. Being a child out of the '60s, I was very much > involved in drugs. If you wanted to be part of the subculture in the '60s, > you had to seek out your drugs. It's different today. Kids don't have a > chance. They're confronted by drugs on every block ... It sounds > hypocritical, I know, but there's not so much hypocrisy being a child of the > '60s and having to make this kind of change because we come from a > generation that accepts change. The role of Nolte's antagonist was played by another actor who had worked with Hill before, Powers Boothe. Boothe: > Every movie Walter's ever made is a western ‚Äì it's just that people don't > know it. Thematically, men standing up for themselves and making their way > in the world is a theme that's been in movies throughout the world.

They cut something like 45 minutes out of it!\\"Michael > Ironside on Turbo Kid, Highlander II, and being in the real McBain\\" By Will > Harris The AV Club Feb 4, 2015 accessed 6 February 2015 Ironside said a highlight of the film was meeting composer Ry Cooder. > Ry had an ancient guitar‚Äîit was about 100 years old ‚Äîthat he was using for > the soundtrack, and it got stolen off the set when we were shooting.

According to soundtrack notes; Funeral scene of sheriff Hank Pearson was deleted after first two screenings of the movie. Soundtrack release for the movie does however includes track called \\"The Funeral\\" which was composed by Jerry Goldsmith for that deleted scene. After filming of final shootout was done, director Walter Hill was told to include more of it so he went back and shot more footage but in the end he cut it down because, in his words, \\"it got too big\\". This is probably why this scene has some continuity mistakes which are often thought to be caused by cuts made on violent scenes in order to avoid X rating. Tri Star Pictures studio executives disliked the first version of theatrical trailer so they made their own. However, their version of the trailer made the movie look like it's ex-soldiers vs Texas Ranger type of movie, which it isn't. Jerry Goldsmith composed the music for original trailer but after it was rejected the track which he composed was not used. Instead the trailer which was released included two tracks from other movies; Paul's Theme by Giorgio Moroder from Cat People (1982) and Evacuation by Mike Oldfield from The Killing Fields (1984). Release Tri Star announced the film as their Christmas release for the year which upset the filmmakers as they had planned to finish it by April. Reception The movie received generally positive reviews. It currently holds a 70% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews with an average rating of 6.5/10. Hill later said \\"I don't think it was understood how much genre parodying was involved in that picture. It rather mystified a lot of American critics but it has its defenders.\\" Nick Nolte later said the response to the movie was \\"a little tougher\\" than the success of his previous collaboration with Hill, 48 Hours.\\"On The Run With Nick Nolte 'Three Fugitives' Star Explains How He Thrives On Chaos\\" by Amy Longsdorf The Morning Call 27 Jan 1989, accessed 6 Feb 2015 Box office Extreme Prejudice debuted at the US box office with $3.5 million at 1,071 screens its first weekend.

It was hailed as Britain's first worker-controlled, mass-circulation daily, formed as a workers' cooperative by 500 of the 1,846 journalists, photographers, engineers, and print workers who were made redundant in April 1974 by Beaverbrook Newspapers when the Scottish Daily Express closed its printing operations in Scotland and moved to Manchester. The redundant workers, who set up a Scottish Daily News action committee, contributed ¬£200,000 of their redundancy money to set up the newspaper, with the British government promising a loan of ¬£1.2 million to enable them to buy the Scottish Daily Express building in Glasgow at 195 Albion Street‚Äîa replica of the Daily Express's black-glass Art Deco offices in London's Fleet Street, dubbed the \\"Black Lubyanka\\",‚Äîif the committee could raise another ¬£275,000. Around ¬£175,000 of this came from members of the public in shares of ¬£25 each, and just over ¬£100,000 from Robert Maxwell, the owner of Pergamon Press. The newspaper, which had as its slogan \\"Read the people's paper and keep 500 in jobs,\\" folded after six months with a deficit of ¬£1.2 million, but was published for another six months by a small group of employees who, led by journalist Dorothy-Grace Elder, staged the country's one and only newspaper work-in, writing and selling the paper themselves on the streets of Glasgow, taking no salaries, and refusing to leave the Albion Street building. Broadsheet The first 16-page edition of the newspaper rolled off the presses as a broadsheet, as the Scottish Daily Express had been, at 9:50 p.m. on 4 May 1975, under the editorship of Fred Sillito, with Andrew McCallum as news editor, and 500 employee-shareholders. The journalists, based on the third floor of the Albion Street building, agreed to take a basic ¬£69 a week salary and the editor ¬£150.McKay and Barr, 1976, p. 70 Dorothy-Grace Elder, later an early Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999, became the editor of the women's section. The first issue sold out at over 300,000 copies. Although the broadsheet format was then believed by many employees to be a mistake, as reports had shown that the Scottish public preferred the tabloid format, the action committee, now called the executive council or works council, confidently expected circulation to fall to 220,000 within three weeks as the novelty of the newspaper wore off.McKay and Barr, 1976, p. 71 However, circulation dropped further and more quickly than expected, reaching 190,000 in the third week. After taking returns into account, this produced an actual sales figures of less than 180,000, which meant that financial losses had begun to occur. According to Christopher Hird in the New Internationalist, a feasibility study conducted by Strathclyde University before the paper began publication indicated that the average daily sale needed to be 200,000 to break even, and that the venture could not work given the costs and expected sales. After the capital costs were taken into account, Hird wrote, the company had a start-up budget of only ¬£950,000, a relatively small amount to launch a new paper. Relaunch By August 1975, losses were running at ¬£30,000 a week with daily circulation down to 80,000, and it was decided to relaunch the newspaper as a tabloid, the first issue of which was published on 18 AugustMcKay and Barr, 1976, p. 122 with a print run of 240,000, priced at 5p. Few of the workers had experience of publishing a tabloid, and by the end of August, losses were lower, running at ¬£17,000 a week, but with circulation down to 170,000. Losses On 15 September 1975, 300 of the workers attended an emergency meeting set up by Robert Maxwell, who accused the management of the newspaper of playing politics with the workers' jobs, in part because, he said, they were refusing to allow managers to manage and were blocking a price rise that Maxwell felt might save the newspaperMcKay and Barr, 1976, p. 132 The result of the meeting was that two of the managers were removed from the executive council and replaced by two of Maxwell's appointees, Dorothy-Grace Elder and Tommy Clarke. The losses continued, made worse on 19 September when Beaverbrook began legal action to recover ¬£59,000 the company said was still owed on the sale of the building. The litigation destroyed what was left of the newspaper's financial viability and credit was no longer available. Bills had to be paid immediately, journalists no longer had lines of credit for taxis and petrol, photographers had to pay up front for photographic supplies, and the accounts department became swamped with demands for payment from nervous creditors.McKay and Barr, 1976, p. 142 Final days During the final days of the newspaper, its content became self-obsessed, with appeals to the Scottish people to save their own newspaperMcKay and Barr, 1976, p. 148 The editor was forced out, and a new editor appointed, Nathan Goldberg, a communist and the newspaper's former night editor, who took over on 6 October. When asked how he felt about this, he compared himself to the captain of the Titanic, thereafter becoming known as \\"Nathan Iceberg\\". The government refused to extend any additional loans to save the newspaper, or to give up its secured creditor status on the loan for the building, which would have meant the newspaper could have raised money using the building as collateral. During a workers' meeting on 20 October 1975, with circulation running at 150,000 a day, the company chairman Alistair Blyth announced that a provisional liquidator, James Whitton of Coopers & Lybrand, had been appointed to take over the running of the newspaper as administrators, with the aim of saving it rather than continuing the liquidation process.McKay and Barr, 1976, p. 149 Whitton's options were to sell the newspaper as a going concern, find new investors, or split up and sell the assets. The advantage of having a liquidator sanctioned by the courts on board was that the newspaper's credit was guaranteed and salaries could be paid. The next day, 21 October, members of the executive council met Prime Minister Harold Wilson to ask again, without success, that the government's loan conditions be relaxed. On Saturday, 1 November, the workers held a rally in at Custom House Quay attended by several hundred employees and members of the Scottish National Party (SNP), where speakers appealed to the government to save the newspaper and the 500 jobs. Those who addressed the rally included Teddy Taylor of the Conservative Party, Margo MacDonald of the SNP, Jimmy Reid of the Communist Party, and representatives of the Scottish Trades Union Congress as well as ministers of Catholic and Protestant churches. Chairman Alister Blyth told the rally: > [A]nyone in the newspaper industry will tell you ... that it takes at least > a year for a newspaper to become established, get on its feet to settle its > circulation. It became clear that we were under-financed from the start ... > This was aggravated, of course, by the fact that we came out with the wrong > size of newspaper.McKay and Barr, 1976, p. 151 On 6 November, the liquidator announced that he would be winding up the newspaper in two days' time. Work-in At a workers' meeting on 7 November 1975, the remaining employees, led by Dorothy-Grace Elder, decided to stage a work-in by refusing to leave the building, and by writing and selling the newspaper themselves on the streets of Glasgow, with the printing handed over to an outside commercial printer because the Albion Street presses were no longer running. A small group of employees stood outside factories and stores at five o'clock every morning shaking tin cans and asking for donations, a situation that continued for six months until, needing to earn a living, workers began to leave, putting an end to Scotland's experiment in worker- controlled news production. Elder wrote on her Scottish National Party webpage: > For six months, we held that building ‚Äì technically, illegally. The old > black glass Express building was worth millions.

Albion Street building The category-A listed building at 195 Albion Street was later used by the Glasgow Evening Times and, from July 1980, by The Glasgow Herald, whereupon it became known as the Herald building. The nine- storey building, built by Beaverbrook in 1937 and extended in 1955, was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of ¬£25 million and turned into an apartment block housing 149 apartments.

The Collins broadcasting division has incorporated the Fidelipac cartridge into its Automatic Tape Control record and playback units.\\"), and commercially introduced in 1959 by Collins Radio at the 1959 NAB Convention. The cartridge was often used at radio stations until the late 1990s, when such formats as MiniDisc and computerized broadcast automation predominated.  History  The Fidelipac cartridge was the first audio tape cartridge available commercially, based on the endless-loop tape cartridge design developed by Bernard Cousino in 1952, while Eash shared space in Cousino's electronics shop in the early 1950s. Instead of manufacturing the Fidelipac format himself after developing it, Eash decided to license it for manufacture to Telepro Industries, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Telepro then manufactured and marketed the format under the Fidelipac brand name.Sound Recording: The Life Story of a Technology by David Morton @ Google Books  Tape format  Fidelipac was originally a analog recording tape, two-track format. One of the tracks was used for monaural program audio, and the other being used for a cue track to control the player, where either a primary cue tone was recorded to automatically stop the cart, a secondary tone was recorded to automatically re-cue the cart to the beginning of the cart's program material (in some models, two secondary tones, one after the program material, and one before it, were recorded to have the cart machine automatically fast-forward through any leftover blank tape at the end of a cart's program), or a tertiary tone, which was used by some players to trigger another cart player or another form of external equipment. Later versions used three tracks, two for stereo audio, and the third for the cue track. The standard tape speed for Fidelipac carts used in the radio broadcasting industry is 7.5 ips, although some cart players and recorders can be set to record at other speeds, such as 3.75 or 15 ips.Audio Engineer's Reference Book By Michael Talbot-Smith @ Googlebooks  Cartridge format  Unlike the later consumer-marketed 8-track cartridge developed later in 1964 by Bill Lear which had the pinch roller integrated in the cartridge, the Fidelipac cartridge had a hole in the right-hand bottom front corner of the cartridge, where the pinch roller, built into the player instead, would swing up into place to support the tape up against the capstan. While later machines from ATC, ITC, Harris, and others had machines where the pinch roller would automatically engage into the cartridge when the play button was pressed (the capstan motor was already running when the cart was inserted), early machines such as Sparta, Spot- matic, and others made the operator physically push or pull a lever to get the pinch roller in place before playback could begin. However, the 8-track was slower in speed ( ips compared to Fidelipac's ips) and did not have adequate tape support pads, and thus were not \\"broadcast quality.\\" The lower speed and narrower tracks in 8-track cartridges led to higher noise and poorer frequency response. The 8-track design also lacked a cue track. There were three sizes of Fidelipac carts available -- the 4-inch-wide A size (Fidelipac Model 300, 350 and MasterCart), which was a standard 8-track size cart with maximum minute playing time at 7.5 ips (this was the most common and widely used size of Fidelipac cart); the 6-inch-wide B size (Fidelipac Model 600), a larger cartridge designed for holding longer programs; and the even larger 8-inch- wide C size (Fidelipac Model 1200), often used for background music applications like the Rowe Customusic. The A size Fidelipac cartridge was later adapted by Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz in partnership with George Eash in 1963 for his Stereo-Pak cartridge system (also known as a 4-track cartridge), which differed in two ways -- the number of tracks used (four in this case, with two played back at a time to provide a total of two programs of stereo audio), and the tape speed ( ips‚Äîthe same speed as 8-track cartridges, as opposed to Fidelipac's standard ips). Unlike the Fidelipac players which used a stationary head, the Stereo-Pak system used a moving head to go between the two programs (much like the 8-track format, which also used a moving head to access its four stereo programs).

December 1889, signed by Niklaus Riggenbach Niklaus Riggenbach (21 May 1817 - 25 July 1899) was the inventor of the Riggenbach rack system and the counter-pressure brake. He was also an engineer and locomotive builder. Niklaus Riggenbach, from R√ºnenberg, Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland, was born in Guebwiller, Alsace. After the death of his father, his mother returned to Basel with her eight young children. At age 16 Riggenbach began an apprenticeship as a mechanic, going abroad after completing his training. In 1837 he found his way to Paris, where he accepted employment. By taking technical courses in night school, he acquired considerable knowledge in mathematics and physics. With the opening of the Paris-St. Germain railroad line in 1839 he found his vocation to build locomotives. In June 1840 he moved to Karlsruhe, Germany, and found employment in the machine works of Emil Kessler. Here he soon rose to managing director and was involved in the construction of no less than 150 locomotives. One of these steam engines was the \\"Limmat\\" of the Schweizerischen Nordbahn (Swiss Northern Railway), opened on 9 August 1847, also called the Spanisch-Br√∂tli line, which he ferried to Switzerland in order to test it on the Z√ºrich-Baden line. As construction of the Basel-Olten line began in 1853, the board of directors of the Schweizer Centralbahn Gesellschaft (Swiss Central Rail Association) appointed him chief of the machine works. He made several official trips to England and Austria, and crawled under a fair number of steam locomotives and into their boilers, \\"to make the good even better.\\" Various improvements in railroading bear his name. In 1856 he became a master machinist and boss of the new main workshop of the Centralbahn in Olten. Under his direction this workshop evolved into a full-fledged engine works, building the company's own locomotives and bridges. Track grip (adhesion) on the Hauenstein line caused him concern. The difficulties led Riggenbach to the concept of the rack railway. After many attempts he discovered that one could negotiate steeper stretches of track by bolting a rack between the rails, which a toothed wheel or cog on the underside of the locomotive could engage. He built his first locomotive in 1862, and on 12 August 1863 France awarded him Patent No. 59625 for the invention. The Vitznau-Rigi line was inaugurated in 1871 as the first mountain railway to use the Riggenbach system in Europe. The locomotives were equipped with his counter-pressure braking system.

After operating in the Indian Ocean she participated in a Yanagi mission, aimed at connecting Japan and Nazi Germany by submarine. She was the first Japanese submarine to reach Europe, arriving at Lorient, France in August 1942. I-30 returned to Singapore loaded with military technology and information, but hit a mine outside the harbour and sank. Only part of her cargo was salvaged. Service history The submarine was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 7 June 1939, launched on 17 September 1940, completed on 28 February 1942, and commissioned with Commander Endo Shinobu in command. Indian Ocean operations On 27 March 1942 the German Kriegsmarine naval staff requested that the Imperial Navy launch operations against Allied convoys in the Indian Ocean, and on 8 April the Japanese agreed to dispatch a detachment of submarines to the East Coast of Africa. Submarine Squadron 8's 1st Division was withdrawn from its base at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands and assigned the task. On 11 April, I-30 departed Kure for Penang, Malaya, arriving on the 20th. Two days later she sailed from Penang accompanied by the auxiliary cruiser and supply ship Aikoku Maru to reconnoitre selected points on the East African coast for possible attack. In May I-30 sailed along the coast of Africa, launching its Yokosuka E14Y floatplane on a series of reconnaissance flights over Aden, Zanzibar, Dar es Salaam, and Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth and Simon's Town in South Africa searching for targets. On the night of 29 May I-30 she sent her aircraft to the harbour of Diego Suarez at the northern tip of Madagascar, which was occupied by the British. The aircraft sighted the battleship at anchor in the bay, along with the destroyers and , corvettes and , troopship Karanja, hospital ship Atlantis, tanker British Loyalty, merchant ship Llandaff Castle, and an ammunition ship. The next night the Type C submarines I-16 and I-20 launched their Ko-hyoteki midget submarines about 10 miles from the harbour. At 20:25, one torpedoed and damaged the Ramillies. The corvettes counter-attacked with depth charges, but at 21:20 the midget from I-20 torpedoed and sank the British Loyalty. The I-16s midget submarine went missing, presumed sunk, while the I-20s beached further along the coast. Its two crewmen were discovered by Royal Marines, and in the ensuing firefight both were killed. Voyage to Europe In mid-June 1942 I-30 was sent on a Yanagi mission to Europe, rounding the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Atlantic en route to France. On 2 August she arrived in the Bay of Biscay and was escorted into Lorient by a powerful force of German M-class minesweepers and Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 bombers. I-30 was the first Japanese submarine to arrive in Europe during World War II. The officers and crew of I-30 were greeted by Grossadmiral Erich Raeder, Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, and Captain Yokoi Tadao, the Japanese Naval Attach√© to Germany. The officers and crew of I-30 were feted by their German allies, travelling to Berlin where Commander Endo was presented to Adolf Hitler, and returning to Lorient via a sightseeing trip to Paris. In the meantime the I-30s cargo of of mica and of shellac was unloaded. They also supplied the Germans with blueprints of the Type 91 aerial torpedo. In return I-30 was repainted U-boat grey and fitted with a Metox radar detector and a Flakvierling 38 quad 20 mm AA gun, replacing her Type 96 25 mm AA guns. I-30 departed Lorient on 22 August carrying a Japanese engineer as a passenger. Her cargo included blueprints and a full set of the W√ºrzburg air defense ground radar, five German G7a and three G7e torpedoes, five Torpedovorhalterechner (torpedo data computers), 240 Bolde sonar countermeasure rounds, rocket and glider bombs, anti-tank guns, a Zeiss anti-aircraft artillery director (fire control system), two hundred 20 mm AA guns, industrial diamonds valued at one million yen, and fifty Enigma T coding machines. Sinking On 8 October 1942 I-30 arrived at Penang to refuel and replenish, then sailed for Singapore, arriving early on the 13th. Just after 4 p.m. the same day, she departed for Japan, but three miles east of Keppel Harbour hit a British mine and quickly sank with the loss of 13 men. Divers from No. 101 Navy Repair Unit recovered some of her cargo, including most of the 20 mm guns, torpedo data computers, and the radar blueprints, though they were found to be unusable after their immersion in salt water. The radar equipment was completely destroyed. Between August 1959 and February 1960 the wreck was salvaged and then scrapped by Hokusei Sempaku Kogyo K.K.

Biography Silverton built the first all-optical Ethernet in the first mile networks in Palo Alto, California in 1999 to 2000, as the result of research and work that first began in 1991 in Phoenix, Arizona. Fiberhood Networks, Inc, a Silicon Valley company championed by Silverton, and co-founded Sinuhe Hardegree and Jonathan Usuka, along with Christopher Lein, Chris Minchberg, Keith Cooley, and Joe Villareal, failed financially, but the engineering success and ensuing industry enthusiasm from the likes of Pirelli, Corning, France Telecom, Telstra, SBC Communications, and industry standards groups like the IEEE, all validated a proof of concept for this first field-operational implementation of its kind. The Information superhighway term was used in the National Information Infrastructure effort of the 1990s. Silverton's 1997 Stanford University thesis described a \\"Information Superdriveway\\", extending early analogies of \\"internet as roadway\\" connecting consumers to the information city streets and global superhighways. The company existed from about 1998 through 2001. It partnered with PAIX, an early Palo Alto Internet exchange. In 1999 Silverton became founding director of the Open Access Alliance of the Bay Area, a group advocating for independent Internet service providers. In 2001 the company still planned to expand. Silverton presented his experience to the Ethernet in the first mile (EFM) study group in March 2001. After several years of industry collaboration, the standard was published in June 2004. In 2004 he was interviewed as an early adopter of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology.

The centre of the vale is around the bottom of Reddish Vale Road. Reddish Vale Country Park is a country park managed by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. It covers 161 hectares in all and comprises some of the traditional Reddish Vale area, Reddish Vale Farm and the grazing land and Woodhall Fields, about half a mile to the south. Part of it is a designated Local Nature Reserve. Description The railway viaduct and former mill pondReddish Vale is mainly green space, comprising woodland, flat riverside meadows, sloping fields used to graze horses and a golf course. At the end of Reddish Vale Road near is a small car park and a visitor centre housed in portable cabins. A number of footpaths lead in all directions, with the more popular ones following the line of the river, both up and downstream. Highly visible from the visitor centre is the sixteen-arch brick viaduct built in 1875 to carry the Hope Valley Line over the Tame Valley. There is a legend that during construction a local witch cursed the viaduct and anyone who counted the number of arches.Poster in the visitors' centre A railway line once led to Stockport from Reddish Junction at the Brinnington (east) side of the viaduct. This line has been turned into a public bridleway joining the two parts of the country park and forms a section of the Trans Pennine Trail. The Stockport to Stalybridge Line forms part of the western boundary of the vale. A spur once ran to the colliery at Denton. Its position is still visible in places marked by a hedgerow that runs alongside Ross Lave Lane. Where the line had to span Denton Brook an embankment was built using slag and other waste from the mine. This slag was ignited by the hot summers of 1975 and 1976. It continued to smoulder and smoke for a number years until the site was bulldozed and cleared in 1981. Train drivers called the place 'smokey ridge', along the bottom of Denton Brook you can still see the bricks used for the tunnel. Some locals refer to Ross Lave Lane as 'piggy's alley' as there was once a pig farm on the Denton side of the viaduct on the embankment above where Denton Brook joins the River Tame. There was a plan at the end of the 18th century for the Beat Bank Branch Canal to run across the vale, and some sections were dug, but it was abandoned before completion. Nearby are two mill ponds left over from industrial activity in the vale. The ponds were fed from the river above a weir (destroyed in floods in the 1960s, all that remains is the sluice gate) on the upstream side of the viaduct, and provided both power and processing water to Reddish Vale Print Works, a calico printing works dating from before 1800. The works had ceased printing by 1975, and have now been demolished and the land turned into a butterfly park. The ponds are now used for angling, and attract herons and a variety of ducks. Most of the race has been filled in, but a short length carries Denton Brook down to the river. Denton Brook (and a small tributary) marks the traditional boundary between Reddish and Denton. The manorial corn mill (one of several to be known as Reddish Mill) was sited over the brook and was demolished in about 1860 when the ponds were extended. The River Tame in the lower part of the parkWoodhall Fields form the southern or lower (with reference to the river) part of the park. The weir here was used to feed the Portwood Cut, dug in 1796, which ran to the Portwood area of Stockport and powered a number of mills around the start of the 19th century. Part of the fields were once a landfill site for fly ash; this has proved to be a good growing medium for orchids. LNWR Royal Train travels over the Reddish Vale Viaduct in 1905. Whilst not really in the vale, at the northern end the late 16th century Arden Hall or 'Cromwell's Castle' (where Oliver Cromwell allegedly spent the night) and the 17th century Hyde Hall overlook it and form part of the overall landscape. Both are in private hands and not open to the public. Other activities Reddish Vale Golf Club takes up a substantial area on both sides of the river, but does not form part of the country park. The club house was once a substantial private house in its own grounds. Just above the visitor centre, on Reddish Vale Road, is Reddish Vale Farm, with riding stables, meerkats and a children's farm. The buildings and associated grazing were Stockton's Dairy Farm until 1996. The Trans Pennine Trail and the Tame Valley Walk pass through the park. Housing There is now very little housing in the vale. There are 12 terraced houses opposite the farm on the road leading down to the vale. At the bottom of the road opposite the visitors centre is a large dwelling known as Tame House. Tame House was once the offices for the Calico print works. At the back of Tame House is a dirt track called Riverview; there are kennels for racing greyhounds halfway down the track. This was once the canteen for the workers at the print works. Adjacent to the canteen was a large Victorian house but this was demolished in the 1960s. Further along Riverview, where the track meets the river, once stood two rows of terraced houses identical to the ones opposite the farm. These were also demolished in the 1960s after being declared 'slum dwellings'. The same fate may have befallen the terraces opposite the farm if not for the intervention of two twin brothers, John and Christopher Byrne, who removed the Compulsory Purchase Orders put on them, and organised the installation of a sanitation system. There were nine houses situated between the viaduct and the mill ponds, built to house the workers constructing the viaduct. They were later demolished for expansion of the reservoirs. On the opposite side of the river to where Strines Weir once was there were two houses known as Strines Cottages which were farm dwellings. A recent archaeological dig found the foundations of these structures. There was a flour mill situated above Denton Brook not far from Mill Lane. In later years it was used as a school and was known as 'the ark' because of the flowing water visible through the gaps in the floorboards. It appears that there has never been a church in the vale. Recent threats Recent proposals to change the nature of the vale have been met with robust opposition. In 1988, the government of the day asked the Greater Manchester Residuary Body to sell off its holdings in the area; 3,000 people, worried that it would be sold to developers, gathered in the vale to protest. The land was acquired by Stockport Council in 1995. They arrived as three contingents from Brinnington, North Reddish and South Reddish. In 1990, a proposal to create an artificial ski slope at Woodhall Fields was opposed by 7,000 signatories to a petition. The opposition was led by the Tame Valley Defence Group supported by MP Andrew Bennett and the Reddish Reporter. The Defence Group had made trips to the various ski slopes and supplied local people with reports on Sheffield Ski Slope. This proposal echoed an earlier proposal for a snow dome which was opposed by South Reddish Action Group, who were later to merge with the Tame Valley Defence Group to protect the vale. In 1992, the golf club hoped to use part of the vale as landfill; the plans did not come to fruition. This again was opposed by the Tame Valley Defence Group who were strongly supported in this by the Director of Public Health in Stockport.

In Rotis, Aicher explores an attempt at maximum legibility through a highly unified yet varied typeface family that ranges from full serif, glyphic, and sans-serif. The four basic Rotis variants are: * Rotis serif (antiqua) ‚Äî with full serifs * Rotis semi-serif (semi-antiqua) ‚Äî with hinted serifs * Rotis semi-sans (semi-grotesque) ‚Äî with zero serifs but with stroke width variation * Rotis sans (lineale humanist sans-serif) ‚Äî with zero serifs and with minimal variation on stroke width Monotype Originals Rotis versions When the Rotis fonts were reissued under the Monotype Originals label, the fonts support include support of ISO Adobe 2 character set, OpenType features. The Rotis font names are capitalized. Rotis Serif It includes 55 Roman, 56 Italic, 65 Bold fonts. Rotis Semi Sans It includes 45 Light, 46 Light Italic, 55 Roman, 56 Italic, 65 Bold, 75 Extra Bold fonts. Rotis Pro It includes support of ISO Adobe 2, Adobe CE, Latin Extended characters. In addition, separate fonts for Greek and Cyrillic characters were also created. Greek and Cyrillic fonts support ISO Adobe 2 and Latin Extended characters, and support super/sub-script OpenType feature. Rotis II Sans (2011) Rotis serif Rotis semi-serif Rotis semi-sans Rotis sans-serif It is a version of Rotis Sans designed by Monotype Imaging senior designer Robin Nicholas, and freelance designer Alice Savoie. It expands the original with extra three font weights (Light, Semi Bold, and Black) and italics, along with revised letter spacing and kerning, a new set of numerals with similar height to the capitals.Font News: Rotis II Sans, expanded and improved The family includes 14 fonts in seven weights, with complementary italics. OpenType features include access all alternates, case-sensitive forms, numerators/denominators, fractions, standard ligatures, localized forms (OpenType Pro fonts only), proportional/tabular figures, scientific inferiors, superscript/subscript, stylistic alternates, stylistic sets 1, 2 and 3 (OpenType Std fonts only). It supports ISO Adobe 2, Adobe CE, Latin Extended characters (OpenType Pro fonts only). Naming convention The typeface is named after Rotis, a hamlet belonging to the German town of Leutkirch im Allg√§u, where Otl Aicher lived. However, Aicher named the font \\"rotis\\", in minuscules, since Aicher thought of capital letters as a sign of hierarchy and oppression. When the fonts were reissued by Monotype Imaging in 2011, though, the font names were capitalized to \\"Rotis\\". This also affected fonts published by downstream foundries.  Uses  *Bj√∂rk used this font for the artwork of her album Homogenic and all its corresponding singles. *McAfee use the typeface until 2005. * The metro of Bilbao (Metro Bilbao) uses this typeface in its logo and signage, which were also designed by Aicher himself. * The city of Montreal uses Rotis Semi-Sans. However, it was modified slightly to spell out the word Montr√©al. * University Centre at Blackburn College in Lancashire and the college campus it is affiliated with both use Rotis in logos and signage. * The Leibniz University of Hannover uses Rotis Sans in official documents and signage. * The Vrije Universiteit Brussel uses Rotis Sans as its corporate typeface. * ABS-CBN uses Rotis Semi Serif as its corporate typeface and the typeface for some of its companies beginning in 2000. Since 2014, ABS-CBN uses a modified version of the font for its corporate logo. * Accenture used Rotis in their wordmark and advertising until 2017. * Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) also uses Rotis on their website and on their publications. * The Anglican Church of Canada uses Rotis Semi-Serif for its wordmark. * The Finland-based firm Nokia also used this font in their packaging, user manuals and advertising, although this has mostly been replaced with their own font, Nokia Sans, for their phones' user interface and promotional materials. * The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, Centrelink (the government provider of social security/welfare in Australia), uses this typeface in their logo. * Sound Transit uses Rotis Semi Serif for its light rail, commuter train and bus station signs * Auckland City Council used Rotis for traffic signage. * PNC Financial Services, the sixth- largest bank in the United States, uses Rotis Semi Serif for its corporate logo and Rotis Sans Serif for their PNC Grow Up Great initiative, complemented by FF DIN for headlines and body copy. * Singapore's highway and street signage uses Rotis Semi Sans. * It is one of the primary components of FRISK Software's corporate identity. * Also based in Auckland, New Zealand's largest architecture firm Jasmax uses Rotis in all of its documents. * The Rotis family is also used in book publishing, one example being Naomi Klein's No Logo which uses the semi-serif face.

Early life and education Dickson was born in Box Hill to Rick and Effie Dickson and was one of six children. He attended St Pauls College, Traralgon, in Victoria, Australia. Dickson learnt to fly a helicopter whilst employed by the National Safety Council of Australia. He also had a hobby of being an amateur film maker. He took a lot of footage at the Hawthorn Football Club whilst he was on their player list. Football career Dickson made his VFL debut with the Hawthorn Football Club in 1988 after being recruited from Morwell, Victoria. He was a fringe player for the Hawks who played in the midfield (at 180 cm and 75 kg), and spent a lot of time in the reserves side. He was selected as an emergency for the 1989 VFL Grand Final. He went on to play 17 games (kicking 12 goals) for Hawthorn in 3 seasons from 1988-1990\\\\. He then moved to the Brisbane Bears where he played for one season, in 1991. He played in the 1991 reserves premiership side for Brisbane (coached by Rodney Eade). Media career Following his football career, Dickson became a film director, directing the television documentaries The Passion to Play, Shane Crawford Exposed and The Essence of The Game, which was commissioned by the AFL to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Australian rules in 2009. Australian Survivor Dickson was one of the 16 castaways on the first edition of Australian Survivor, which aired on the Nine Network in 2002. He was a member of the Tipara tribe which won all but one tribal immunity challenge, meaning the tribes merged with Tipara having a 7-3 advantage. The Tipara Seven stuck together to vote out the remaining three members of the rival Kadina tribe before having to turn on their own. At the final 6, Dickson formed a new alliance with Sciona Browne and Joel Betts, making a final 3 deal to reach the end of the game. They succeeded, despite Betts facing a tied vote (which he survived due to having less previous votes than another contestant). Dickson secured his place in the Final Two by winning the final immunity challenge and voted out Betts, who had agreed to throw the final challenge so that the pair of allies could make it to the Final Two. Dickson and Browne faced the Final Tribal Council, where he won the A$500,000 grand prize in a 5-2 jury vote. Dickson said at the time that he would use the funds to help his South African mother-in-law emigrate to Australia. Death Dickson and his 5-year-old son Byron died in a car accident whilst on holiday in South Africa on 11 April 2009. Reports at the time said he failed to give way when he performed a u-turn. His oldest son Gabriel, 8, died on 15 April 2009 in the Unitas Hospital due to injuries sustained in the crash. Dickson was the first winner of any Survivor version to die.

Immediately above the rank \\"marshal of the branch\\" is the rank \\"chief marshal of the branch\\". Both ranks are immediately above the rank \\"colonel general\\" and equal to Soviet general of the army. Establishment in 1943 The ranks of marshal of aviation, artillery and armoured troops branches were established on February 4, 1943, with a large, approximately 50mm wide, shoulder board star (the same star as the at-the-time equivalent rank of marshal of the Soviet Union's shoulder board star). When the rank of chief marshal was established on October 27, 1943, the size of the shoulder board's stars for marshals was made about 10mm smaller establishing the superiority of the marshal of the Soviet Union insignia. Also, on October 27, 1943, the ranks of marshal of the branches engineer troops and signals were established. On the uniform tie, marshals wore the marshal's star of the 2nd level. In the branches, the rank of colonel general was followed by the next higher rank of marshal of the branch. While the rank of marshal of a branch was apparently equal to the one of general of the army (who was only entitled to the four small shoulder board stars), the marshals of branches had the marshal's star of the 2nd level on the tie and the large 40mm star on the shoulder boards, but the general of the army had neither. Generals of the army were given the 40mm star shoulder board and the marshal's star of the 2nd level on the tie in 1974. Marshals of branches were normally eligible for promotion to chief marshal of branch, however, neither was eligible for promotion to marshal of the Soviet Union. After 1984, the rank of marshal was preserved only in the air force and artillery. Later, the rank of marshal stopped being conferred even in these branches. The regulations of Russian Army, confirmed in 1993, unified the system of general ranks in all the branches: the ranks of marshal of artillery and marshal of aviation were replaced by the one of general of the army (or army aviation), and the rank of chief marshal was cancelled. {class=\\"wikipedia sortable\\" border=\\"1\\" |-align=\\"center\\" !width=\\"30%\\" colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor= \\"#A0E0A0\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|Sequence of ranks |-align=\\"center\\" |width=\\"30%\\" colspan=\\"2\\" bgcolor= \\"#A0E0A0\\" |General of the army (–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –∞—Ä–º–∏–∏) |width=\\"30%\\"   bgcolor= \\"#A0E0A0\\"|Higher rank: Marshal of the Soviet Union (–ú–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞) |-align=\\"center\\" |width=\\"35%\\" style=\\"background:#bfbfbf;\\"Lower rank: Marshal of the branch (–ú–∞ÃÅ—Ä—à–∞–ª —Ä–æÃÅ–¥–∞ –≤–æÃÅ–π—Å–∫) |width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#afafaf;\\"|30px Chief marshal of the branch (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞ÃÅ—Ä—à–∞–ª —Ä–æÃÅ–¥–∞ –≤–æÃÅ–π—Å–∫) |} Chief marshal The ranks of chief marshal of the branches of aviation, artillery, armoured troops, engineer troops, and signals were established October 27, 1943. The three former branches had already had (since February 4, 1943) the corresponding ranks of marshal; in the two latter branches the ranks of marshal and of chief marshal were established simultaneously. When the rank of chief marshal was established, the size of the shoulder board's stars for all marshals except the now superior marshal of the Soviet Union were made about 10mm smaller and for chief marshals, the star was surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the uniform tie, chief marshals wore the marshal's star of the 2nd level. During the next forty years, the ranks of chief marshal were conferred mainly on deputy defense ministers ‚Äì commanders of the corresponding branch. The ranks of chief marshal of engineer troops and chief marshal of signals, abolished in 1984, were never conferred on anybody. No chief marshal promotions were conferred after 1984. The youngest chief marshal was aviator Golovanov, 40 when promoted in 1944. Three of thirteen people who held the chief marshal rank did not retire normally: Novikov was imprisoned for seven years; Nedelin perished in the flame of an exploded rocket; Varentsov was accused of heedlessness, dismissed and degraded (his subordinate, Oleg Penkovsky, had been found to be a spy).

Their mission is to: 'Transform lives and communities through the power of circus arts and street theatre'.http://www.belfastcircus.org/mission The school's most recent director was Will Chamberlain, who died of cancer on 19 October 2017, after holding the position since 2000.http://artscouncil-ni.org/news/obituary-will- chamberlain-1963-2017 Performances The Belfast Community Circus School produces a number of shows featuring young people each year. Performances take place in the Circus School and on the streets, including annual shows in the Festival of Fools. The Circus School also programmes a season of street theatre running each Sunday over the summer months in Cotton Court in the heart of Belfast's Cathedral Quarter. Acts featured are a combination of artists based in Belfast and visiting artists from Europe, USA and Australia. In addition, the Belfast Community Circus School has established a social economy trading wing called Premiere Circus. This operates as an agency securing work for artists based in Belfast who work across Ireland. History BCCS was set up in 1985 by Jim Webster, Donal McKendry and Mike Moloney (1953 - 2013http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/263/people/mike- moloney-1953-‚Äì-2013 Obituary Notice in Arts Professional) to promote personal and community development through the teaching of circus skills. Throughout the height of the Troubles, BCCS was able to stage successful cross community projects across Northern Ireland. For more than a decade, BCCS operated workshops and created shows in a variety of venues ranging from church halls to community centres and the Crescent Arts Centre. In 1999 the Circus School took a massive step forward when it moved into Ireland's first dedicated circus building in the heart of Belfast's Cathedral Quarter - an area of the city centre promoting arts and culture.\\"Magic ring - When the circus school came to town it brought new hope and skills to Belfast's children\\", The Guardian, 13 October 1999 p26 Since moving into the Gordon Street premises, BCCS has seen a massive growth in all aspects of its work including youth circus, professional development for artists, performances and outreach work.\\"Efforts to embrace the children on margins\\", News Letter (Belfast), 6 March 2003, p11 Outreach BCCS has many outreach programmes which involves travelling to youth and community centres to take workshops.

Originated by actor Tyler Christopher in 1996, he left the show on July 14, 1999. Due to Nikolas' importance on the soap, he was immediately replaced by Coltin Scott on July 20, 1999. Scott left the role on April 16, 2003, as Christopher made his return on April 21, 2003. Christopher vacated the role on July 28, 2011, after he was let go from the series. Christopher once again reprised the role on a recurring basis in honor of the soaps' fiftieth anniversary; he was later upgraded to a series regular. Actor Nick Stabile took claim of the role in June 2016 in Christopher's absence. Created by head-writers Robert Guza, Jr. and Karen Harris and introduced by executive producer Wendy Riche in 1996 as the illegitimate son of Laura Spencer, the character was immediately popular with audiences. Hailed by Soap Opera Digest as the \\"Best New Male Character\\" in 1996, Nikolas's arrival immediately implodes the happy life of supercouple Luke and Laura. In 2019, Marcus Coloma was cast in the role. Casting Nick Stabile was temporarily cast into the role of Nikolas from June to July 2016. The role was originated by daytime newcomer, Tyler Christopher then known as Tyler Baker on July 15, 1996. Christopher tried to audition for the role of Stone Cates in 1993 but was turned away. In April 1996, Christopher was one of several actors to audition for casting director Mark Teschner. Christopher hired an acting coach to prepare him for the audition and worked regularly with General Hospital's onset acting coach, John Homa. In June 1996, Christopher received a call back to read for executive producer Wendy Riche and was later brought back to screen test with several actors, including Stephen Nichols, who would play Stefan. Christopher was hired two days later, signed a three-year contract, and filmed his first scenes in late June 1996. In May 1999, rumors circulated that Christopher would not renew his contract which was set to expire in June. The series had also put out a casting call for an actor similar to Christopher which meant he could potentially be replaced. By the time of Christopher's departure, Nikolas had become integral to the series, a recast was very much needed, and Christopher was immediately replaced by Coltin Scott. Of his casting, Scott said that viewers didn't have any warning. \\"Tyler was there Monday, and I came in on Tuesday\\" he said. Though inexperienced, Scott was immediately put to the test opposite Nichols, Geary, and Francis so he got \\"very comfortable very quickly.\\" After a year without finding work, Scott's mother wanted him to come home. And he promised her he would if he didn't get a job in six months. Scott booked the role of Nikolas six months to the day of his promise to his mother. In late March 2003, Scott would vacate the role in the summer of 2003 after failed contract negotiations. According to his official website, Scott was very upset by the decisions made. At the same time, Christopher also became available and it was an opportunity the series couldn't pass up, revealed executive producer, Jill Farren Phelps. In November 2005, Tyler Christopher underwent surgery for a broken arm and Chris Beetem served as a temporary recast starting on December 6 and lasting five episodes. In March 2011, Soap Opera Digest reported that Christopher had been let go from the series as he would soon appear on ABC Family's The Lying Game produced by former GH head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. Christopher confirmed the news to Soaps in Depth that he had been released from his contract on Friday March 18, 2011, and the character of Nikolas was to be written out. Christopher's contract was set to expire in June and the date would have marked the beginning of the last 13-week-cycle period in his deal‚Äîat which time the network would notify the actor of their decision to offer another contract. While Christopher had previously admitted he was unsure about renewing his contract, he was open to working both shows and thought it was a likely possibility considering they were both under ABC. On- Air On-Soaps also revealed that \\"cost cutting measures GH\\" also factored into the decision. \\"I haven't had time to absorb it. It was pretty unexpected. I didn't really see it coming\\" the actor said of his firing. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Tyler Christopher made it very clear that he was fired from the series and that his recurring role on The Lying Game did not factor into the decision. \\"I was trying to stay on GH, however that worked out financially\\" Christopher explained of his expecting to take a pay cut. However, the actor was instead told that a \\"pay cut was not an option,\\" though it was an option for others. The actor was angry over the decision and said \\"I felt like I earned my spot as a permanent fixture on the show.\\" Christopher filmed his last scenes on May 20, 2011 and last appeared in June. Christoper revealed that things felt awkward on his last day because \\"nobody really knew what to say to me.\\" While the manner in which the situation was handled gave Christopher a \\"bad taste in my mouth,\\" the actor had already agreed to a three episode return stint under newly appointed head writer Garin Wolf by the time his final scenes aired. Those scenes would air in late July 2011. In January 2013, executive producer Frank Valentini revealed that he had met with Tyler Christopher about potentially reprising the role of Nikolas in celebration of show's 50th anniversary. In February 2013, Christopher's co-star Nancy Lee Grahn‚Äîwho played Alexis Davis‚Äîrevealed that Christopher had been on set. However, there was speculation that Christopher's return was supposed to be a surprise because there was no prior announcement from the network. Christopher himself announced his return on Twitter a month later and reappeared on March 22. \\"It's an absolute honor\\" Christopher said of being included in the 50th anniversary storylines. Though the possibility of his return had always been a thought, the actor did not expect anything to come of it. Valentini told Christopher his return would be open ended while the actor awaited news on production for The Lying Game. While renewal of The Lying Game was stalled, Christopher revealed that he would remain with the series longer than planned. Soap Opera Digest announced in June 2013 that Christopher had been placed on contract. In the summer of 2014, Christopher revealed that he would be going on a four-month-long road trip with his family leading to immediate speculation that he would be off screen for the duration and would not affect his airtime. Head writer Ron Carlivati quickly clarified that Christopher's trip would occur during the weeks in which the show went on hiatus. In May 2016, actor Nick Stabile was temporarily cast in the role of Nikolas, with Christopher being unavailable, for an undisclosed amount of time. Stabile's tenure began on June 17, 2016 and ended on July 19, 2016. In September 2016, Soap Opera Digest reported that contract negotiations between Christopher and the soap had fallen apart, and that he would not be reprising his portrayal of Nikolas. Christopher made his last appearance on June 16, 2016. In 2019, actor Marcus Coloma was cast in the role of Nikolas; he made his first appearance during the October 31, 2019, episode. Development Characterization According to Christopher, Nikolas is initially introduced as a \\"self-assured\\" teen who comes from money. While he immediately causes trouble, he is not a \\"villain\\" but he is \\"misguided\\" due to growing up without his parents. Christopher believed the character could go in any direction. In his early years, Nikolas is very \\"conflicted\\" and has a certain \\"sneer\\" about him but a \\"sympathy\\" that can win anyone over. Christopher later voiced his frustrations with playing such a young character and consciously chose to develop Nikolas in more a young man with a \\"firmer grasp\\" on his life. He needs to be \\"more of a man, taking more control\\" Christopher said. Christopher revealed that it was the character's \\"complexity\\" that initially drew him to the role. \\"Nikolas was sophisticated, and it took it in a different direction than they wanted.\\" While the writers intended for Nikolas to be \\"stern, hardnosed\\" and unwilling to allow anyone in, Christopher made the choice to throw in some vulnerability for the character, whether he puts it on display or not. Christopher wanted viewers to like the character despite his bad deeds. Unlike the actor, Nikolas is very \\"elegant,\\" \\"refined,\\" and \\"proper.\\" Nikolas is \\"the moody, teen-in- turmoil.\\" Robert Schork of Soap Opera Weekly describe Nikolas an \\"adolescent wise beyond his years\\" and an \\"old soul whose sophistication and maturity belie his youthful facade.\\" Nikolas is not comfortable with his royal status at all, and it makes him feel out of place. Paternity In 1998, Nikolas's paternity comes into question when it is revealed that Stefan is his biological father. Not only does it further complicate his relationship with Laura, but Christopher said Nikolas could be \\"angry\\" or \\"grateful to discover that he has a father after all these years of thinking he didn't.\\" The revelation drives a wedge between Nikolas and his family until he realizes that the family he is running from is the family he has always wanted. The paternity story is key to Nikolas's evolution as a character. Christopher was actually aware of the plot twist when he joined the show and kept the secret until the onscreen reveal in 1999. The reveal is \\"pivotal\\" because it forces Nikolas to start growing up, and become a bit more independent. \\"He has an identity now.\\" Stefan and Laura explained that they hid Nikolas's paternity to protect him from Helena, who likely would have killed him if he were Stefan's son because she hated Stefan. However, by the end of 1999, it was revealed that Helena herself orchestrated the plan to take control of the family fortune away from Nikolas. Changing Nikolas's paternity would take away his right to the Cassadine inheritance which automatically goes to the prince. Relationships In 1996, when asked about Nikolas's potential love life, Christopher said he did know of any plans. Though described by Soap Opera Digest as an \\"Unwitting Cassa-Nova,\\" Nikolas has trouble trusting others because he has lived such a sheltered life and even dumps his girlfriend, Sarah Webber (Jennifer Sky) when they get too close. According to Christopher, Nikolas is more interested in having a relationship with someone who can teach him something, because he longs for normalcy and is very uncomfortable with the \\"prince title.\\" Christopher said that for Nikolas, Emily (Amber Tamblyn) has the right personality, but she at the time is too young. On the other hand, Christopher saw Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough) as a good match for Nikolas, but Robin is more interested in his friendship than romance. Storylines Background Nikolas is a Russian Prince and the son of Stavros Cassadine and Laura Spencer. Nikolas faces a constant struggle to define his own identity within the context of the history of the Cassadine and Spencer families. He and his half brother Lucky Spencer often face the crossfire of the long-standing war between them, often at the hands of Nikolas' grandmother, Helena Cassadine. Nikolas Mikhail Stavrosovich Cassadine was born in Greece on November 5, 1982. However his birth year is revised to 1981 when he enters the canvas as a 15-year-old in July 1996. In 1998, he is seen celebrating his 18th birthday, revising his birth year again to 1980. It is later assumed his birth year is 1977 in comparison to the aging of his younger brother birth year shown as 1979 marriage certificate, in May 2011. In 1983, Nikolas' presumed-dead mother Laura is revealed to be alive and to have been held captive by Stavros as an act of revenge against Luke Spencer for the events leading to the death of his grandfather Mikkos Cassadine. Laura had been forced to marry Stavros, but is able to return home and reunite with Luke, meanwhile Stavros is presumed dead. In 1996, it is revealed that Laura had been pregnant during that time. The child had been named Nikolas, after Tsar Nicholas II. It is also revealed at this point that when Laura tried to secretly reclaim Nikolas in 1984, his grandmother Helena presumably murdered Laura's mother Lesley Webber. To protect her loved ones, Laura had decided to keep the secret. 1996‚Äì2006 Fifteen-year-old Nikolas comes to Port Charles to donate his bone marrow to his sister Lulu Spencer. He and his half- brother Lucky have instant animosity. Nikolas decides to stay and eventually becomes best friends with Emily Quartermaine, who develops romantic feelings for him. Nikolas and Lucky work with Emily and Elizabeth Webber to catch Emily's blackmailer, and it is the first time Nikolas and Lucky start to bond as brothers. They become closer while Nikolas deals with being told that his uncle Stefan Cassadine is instead his father. Laura is determined to foster her relationship with her son, and the two bond when it appears Lucky perished in a fire. In December 1999, Nikolas learns Stavros really is his father. A few months later, he learns Helena is holding Lucky hostage, as well as having kept Stavros alive by cryogenically freezing him. Helena's plan is thwarted and Stavros falls to his death in a fight with Luke Spencer. Nikolas is then devastated when Laura enters a catatonic state after the murder of her adoptive father Rick Webber. As a result of losing their mother, Lucky, Lulu, and Nikolas become extremely close. Emily Quartermaine and Nikolas Cassadine. Though Nikolas has romances with both Sarah Webber and Gia Campbell, his greatest love turns out to be Emily. They become close as Emily battles breast cancer. As their feelings grow, Emily becomes torn between Nikolas and her first love Zander Smith. Believing she is dying, Emily marries Zander as her last gift to him. She then enters remission, and eventually Emily and Nikolas slept with one another. Witnessing their adultery starts Zander on a downward spiral, and Emily ends their marriage. Zander tries to kidnap Emily, but is killed by the police. Stefan also interferes, but eventually commits suicide. When a car accident leaves Nikolas with amnesia, war-widow Mary Bishop takes him in, making it seem like he is dead. Mary lies to Nikolas and tells him he is her late husband Connor, who coincidentally looks just like Nikolas. Emily eventually finds Nikolas, and gently tries to help him regain his memory. Finally remembering Emily, the two reconcile, causing Mary to break down and go on a murder spree. She is eventually shot and killed. Helena returns to stop their relationship, and Nikolas throws her off of cliff, at which point she is presumed dead. Nikolas pleads guilty and the two marry before he is sent to prison. Nikolas' doppelg√§nger Connor Bishop returns to town alive, and begins romancing Emily as vengeance for Mary, and on the orders of Helena, who turns out to be alive. Connor rapes Emily, who afterwards emotionally retreats from Nikolas due to their similarity. Their marriage is strained, and Nikolas begins an adulterous affair with Courtney Matthews. Emily and Nikolas divorce, and Courtney becomes pregnant. It is unclear if the father is Nikolas or her ex-husband Jasper Jacks. Jax learns Nikolas is the father, and switches the DNA results to make it look like he is. During the Port Charles encephalitis outbreak, Nikolas and Courtney both become ill, and Courtney gives birth to a boy.

Nikolas starts the Emily Bowen Quartermaine Clinic to treat patients without insurance, as a way to honor Emily.

Lucky finds out eventually and confronts them, saying he's done with both of them. 2010‚Äì2011 On Valentine's Day, Elizabeth passes out from hypothermia and is found by Lucky. She finds out she is pregnant and the baby could be either Nikolas' or Lucky's. After finding Elizabeth on the hospital roof looking ready to jump, she is sent to Shadybrook.

She tells Lucky when he begins a downward spiral dealing with his father. Nikolas refuses to believe it and plans to leave the country with Aiden. He reconsiders and leaves Aiden with Elizabeth and Lucky before leaving town in June 2011. Nikolas briefly returns in July, when he comes to Cassadine Island, where Lulu is looking for Luke, to speak with Helena. After telling Helena to stay away from Aiden and to never speak of him again, Nikolas tells Lulu how he always felt second to Lucky because everyone was worried about how Lucky felt when he was growing up. He also tells Lulu her search for Luke is just like their mother's belief that Luke was a good man, which eventually destroyed their marriage. He leaves, and Lulu realizes her mistake and returns to Port Charles. 2013‚Äì2016, 2019 Nikolas returns to town in March 2013 when Lulu is abducted and is about to provide information on her whereabouts when he is shot and rendered comatose.

Unfortunately, the relationship ends in disaster when Nikolas discovers that Britt's son Ben is actually his nephew, as Britt had stolen Lulu's frozen embryo to entrap Patrick. Helena resurfaces very much alive, and Nikolas is shocked to learn that Helena's new henchman \\"Jake Doe\\" is actually Jason Morgan, Emily's brother who was presumed dead. However, he keeps Jason's identity a secret so he can take over ELQ, the Quartermaine family business, to rebuild Cassadine Industries, as Helena's schemes had fleeced the Cassadines out of their fortune. Nikolas begins an affair with con artist Hayden Barnes, who has been posing as Jake Doe's wife. When Hayden's scheme is exposed during the Nurses' Ball, Nikolas informs Elizabeth that \\"Jake\\" is really Jason. Elizabeth chooses to keep the secret, wanting to be with Jason. Hayden overhears this, and blackmails Nikolas into taking her in. With the help of Lucy Coe, Nikolas gains control of ELQ.

Hayden wakes up with amnesia. and Nikolas moves her back into Wyndemere, and hires her at ELQ to keep an eye on her. The two continue their romance. Jason eventually learns his true identity, and breaks up with Elizabeth for covering it up. He also realizes Nikolas knew the truth, sparking a feud between the two. Nikolas and Hayden elope to Las Vegas. However, Nikolas discovers Hayden is actually Rachel Berlin, the daughter of a businessman in prison for a massive Ponzi scheme. Nikolas demands Hayden give him a divorce, but Hayden blackmails him into staying married, revealing she knows Nikolas had her shot. Jason and his wife, Sam, also figure out Nikolas had Hayden shot, and they blackmail him into selling ELQ back to Jason. Nikolas, meanwhile, finds Hayden in possession of diamonds that belonged to her father, which she stole before the IRS could seize. He tries to use the diamonds to make Hayden miserable enough to ask for a divorce. Nikolas pawns one of Hayden's diamonds to make a donation to the Nurses' Ball. Hayden is furious, and decides to turn Nikolas in at the Nurses' Ball, but he stalls her. He goes home with the diamonds and, hours later, is on the cliffs beneath Wyndemere, having apparently fallen out of the window. His body is never recovered, and he is presumed dead. Jason is arrested for his murder, but goes on the run and figures out Nikolas faked his death and tried to frame Hayden. Nikolas, meanwhile, heads to London and bumps into Ava Jerome. Nikolas and Ava are briefly kidnapped, but escape and head to Cassadine Island. Jason and Sam find him there, trying to track down Nikolas to clear Jason's name. The group then meets the mysterious Theo Hart, who claims to be a fisherman taking shelter on the island because of the storm. As the storm clears, Theo leaves and Nikolas is reunited with Laura and Lulu, who have come to the island looking for him after Spencer revealed that Nikolas is alive. As the group prepares to leave the island, Theo returns wielding a gun and reveals himself to be Nikolas' bastard uncle Valentin Cassadine. Valentin forces Nikolas to sign over the Cassadine estate to him, then proceeds to shoot Nikolas, causing him to stumble off the balcony into the waters below, leaving him presumed dead. In late 2019, Nikolas returns to Port Charles. Reception Viewers and critics immediately loved the Nikolas character and his introduction.

The village is on a plateau surrounded mainly by bogland in the north of the county. It lies between Lough Neagh, Lough Gullion and the River Bann. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 249 people. Derrytrasna is within the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area. History At the turn of the 19th-century, Derrytrasna was no more than a small collection of properties at a crossroads on the main road from Portadown to Charlestown. The main industries at this time were fishing and agriculture and the area being noted for its eel, pollan and trout. One of the most notable events in the history of the village was the destruction of St Mary's Roman Catholic Church on 6 January 1839. The nearly completed church building was destroyed in what was known as the \\"Night of the Big Wind\\". At the time the Newry Reporter stated: > We regret to learn that the new Chapel of the Parish of Seagoe, which had > been erected at great expense and with extreme exertion on the part of the > Parish Priest, the Rev. Morgan, was levelled to the ground by the late > fearful hurricane. It had just been roofed and would soon have been ready > for consecration. This is a lamentable occurrence. The people of Seagoe were > rejoicing in the hope of having a temple for the worship of the Most High, > and just when it seemed secure to them they have lost the fruit of their > long and pious labours. We are sure that the case will strongly excite the > sympathies of the Christian public and that any appeal which may be made by > the Rev. Mr. Morgan to repair the injury which has been done in this parish > will meet with a ready and generous response. > \\"A ready and generous response\\" was indeed made to Dr. Morgan's appeal and > the church was rebuilt during the years, 1839-41. In the 1950s Loughview Terrace was developed on Derrytrasna Lane, but the growth of Derrytrasna only really started in the 1980s with the development of Derrytrasna Close and Derrytrasna Lane estates. Lisnagade Mews and Loughview Manor were subsequently added and lately the two new estates of Bann Close and Derryloiste Meadows have been developed. Today The village comprises mainly residential development, most of which are modern bungalows, and acts as a small service centre to the surrounding rural community, with a church, a primary school and a post office facility. Most local people work in larger settlements like Lurgan, Portadown or Belfast, but there is limited employment within Derrytrasna and the surrounding area.

The station is owned by P & P Cable Holdings. The station was previously a repeater of WXON-LP, whose license was cancelled in January 2012. W09CK is still on the air part-time and broadcasts public-domain movies. There are no plans to air full-time or to air new programs until after it is known if the station can stay on the air after the spectrum auction. The station broadcasts on channel 9, but does not even cover all of Flint. The station currently broadcasts at 85 watts from a transmitter on the north side of Flint. Since the 2009 DTV transition in the United States does not affect low power stations, neither W09CK nor former parent WXON-LP had plans to broadcast in digital; however, W09CK will be required to convert to digital or close down by the time that the digital transition takes effect for low power stations, if and when such plans take to effect. It is unlikely that the station will be allowed to convert to digital without a move to another frequency, as it could possibly interfere with CBET-DT in Windsor on VHF 9. The station could also lose its current channel position after the spectrum auction, as it is a low- power repeater station.

It was unique as a self-contained printed product for the commercial market not requiring miniatures or building a map. Tactics II is a revised version published by Avalon Hill in 1958, then reissued in 1961 and 1973. It uses hexagons instead of squares, after Roberts saw a picture of a RAND game Life magazine that used hexagons which he believed would provide more realistic movement. In 1972, the game was discontinued due to rising costs, but was redesigned in 1973 with less costly components and used as a loss leader as it was an introductory wargame. In 1983, Avalon Hill released a 25th anniversary edition of the original Tactics, although with a different (new) map. Play Tactics pioneered many game mechanics which became standard in the board wargame industry, including the odds-ratio combat results table and variable movement costs for entering squares (later hexes) containing different types of terrain. It also evolved the use of cardboard counters which had been previously introduced with the 1911 \\"invasion literature\\" genre game War Tactics or Can Great Britain Be Invaded?.War Tactics or Can Great Britain Be Invaded? at the Imperial War Museum Pieces include the armored units, headquarters units, regular infantry units, and specialized units consisting of mountaineers, paratroopers, and amphibious units.

Billions of dollars are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential avian influenza pandemic. Over ten billion dollars have been lost and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1. People have reacted by buying less chicken causing poultry sales and prices to fall. Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic.

Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1: *killing millions of poultry *vaccinating poultry against bird flu *vaccinating poultry workers against human flu *limiting travel in areas where H5N1 is found *increasing farm hygiene *reducing contact between livestock and wild birds *reducing open-air wet markets *limiting workers contact with cock fighting *reducing purchases of live fowl *improving veterinary vaccine availability and cost.Council on Foreign Relations For example, after nearly two years of using mainly culling to control the virus, the Vietnam government in 2005 adopted a combination of mass poultry vaccination, disinfecting, culling, information campaigns and bans on live poultry in cities.Reuters article Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu published on April 28, 2006 The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply, resulting in devastating losses for many poultry farmers. Poor poultry farmers can't afford mandated measures keeping their bird livestock from contact with wild birds (and other measures) thus risking losing their livelihood altogether. Multinational poultry farming is increasingly becoming a profit loser as H5N1 achieves status as endemic in wild birds worldwide.Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu Financial ruin for poor poultry farmers, that can be as severe as threatening starvation, has caused some to commit suicide and many others to stop cooperating with efforts to deal with H5N1; further increasing the human toll, the spread of the disease and the chances for a pandemic mutation.Reuters article Cambodian ostracised for reporting bird flu published on April 12, 2006.

Donald Rumsfeld, formerly United States Secretary of Defense, is a past board member and current minor shareholder of Gilead Sciences which owns intellectual property rights to Oseltamivir (also called \\"Tamiflu\\"). In November 2005, George W. Bush urged Congress to pass 7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which one billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu. Some believe The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is essentially a problem of industrial poultry practices.Grain international, non-profit foundation BBC news CNN Others have a more nuanced position. According to the CDC article H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza by Robert G. Webster et al.:\\"Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.\\"CDC H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza by Robert G. Webster et al. Dr. Robert Webster explains: \\"If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world.\\"MSNBC quoting Reuters quoting Robert G. Webster In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok saying that \\"The issue of vaccines has to take top priority\\", and Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, saying that China's vaccinations could be \\"masking\\" the virus. The BBC reported that Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: \\"The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done, because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected; and then you get drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours' of H5N1 out there.\\"BBC Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet February 22, 2006 Some have called for tax breaks due to H5N1. A May 7, 2006 report from India E-News states that: \\"Pakistani poultry farmers have sought a 10-year tax exemption to support their dwindling business after the detection of the H5N1 strain of bird flu triggered a fall in demand and prices, a poultry trader said. \\"We have asked the government to give us tax exemption on income from the poultry business for at least 10 years to meet losses caused by the bird flu scare\\", Abdul Basit told DPA.

At the time of their marriage, Caroline required Fillmore to sign a prenuptial agreement. The couple purchased a mansion on Niagara Square in Buffalo, where they settled. They are believed to have had a happy marriage, and Caroline greatly enjoyed her newfound status as the wife of a former President, though her mental and physical health began to decline in the 1860s.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media and broadcasts on 96.9 MHz at 310 watts ERP from the Illinois Mountain master tower in Marlborough, New York Programming WRRB's programming is simulcast with that of 92.7 WRRV Middletown, New York which serves the lower Hudson Valley, Catskills, Sussex County, New Jersey and Pike County, Pennsylvania. Though on paper WRRV is seen as the primary station, in reality WRRB is the more dominant of the two based on cume and sales (and the fact that, since 2000, the station has been run out of the longtime studios of sister WPDH on Pendell Road in Poughkeepsie). Information on the specifics of WRRV's format can be seen in the article on WRRV. History The 96.9 frequency came on the air in Fall 1989 as Bridge Broadcasting-owned WEXT (\\"Next FM\\") running a \\"new adult contemporary\\" format (a combination of smooth jazz and new-age music). Aside from its licence, WEXT had another first in being the first station operated by a local marketing agreement as WKIP/WRNQ owner Richard Novik later controlled WEXT. WEXT's format was a bit ahead of its time and though it had a strong start and admiration of music critics and musicphiles, however this critical success did not translate into ratings as \\"Next FM\\" was the market's lowest rated FM signal in its only Arbitron ratings book in 1990. Even with the station's poor ratings, it was somehow seen as a threat to the ratings of the more mainstream and successful WRNQ. To boost WRNQ, Novik flipped WEXT's format to a simulcast of the talk radio format of WKIP in February 1991 as WKIP-FM. Though the two stations split off at points, the simulcast of WKIP came with nearly no measurable ratings on 96.9 and at a financial loss on Novik's end. In August 1993, Novik terminated the LMA with Bridge who on September 1 of that year began an LMA with Woodstock-based WDST, bringing that station's storied Adult Album Alternative format to points south under the calls WDSP. With a dedicated existing WDST audience on board and a good number of new listeners, WDSP became a middle-of-the pack station overall in the market but with good demographics; this success led Bridge to sell the station to WDST owner CHET-5 Broadcasting in 1994. The station remained moderately successful, however a financial crisis in early 1997 led CHET-5 to sell WDSP and WKNY in Kingston to the Crystal Radio Group in April of that year. Seeing an opportunity to take its WRRV in Middletown to a full-market signal, WDSP flipped to a WRRV simulcast as WRRB which continues to this day. Townsquare Media In October 2000, Crystal sold its holdings to Aurora Communications, which a year later was bought out by Cumulus Media. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Cumulus would swap its stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York (including WRRB) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations.

They were more commonly known (before the BBC aired a television adaptation) as the Parliamentary Novels. The common threads throughout the series are the wealthy aristocrat and politician Plantagenet Palliser, and his wife, Lady Glencora. The plots involve British and Irish politics in varying degrees, specifically in and around Parliament. The Pallisers do not always play major roles, and in The Eustace Diamonds they merely comment on the main action. The books are: * Can You Forgive Her? (1864) * Phineas Finn (1869) * The Eustace Diamonds (1873) * Phineas Redux (1874) * The Prime Minister (1876) * The Duke's Children (1879) The series overlaps with Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire, also a series of six novels, which deal with life in the fictional county where the Palliser family is politically important. Trollope considered Can You Forgive Her?, Phineas Finn, Phineas Redux and The Prime Minister to be the four novels that constitute the Palliser series. In his autobiography he wrote: > To carry out my scheme I have had to spread my picture over so wide a canvas > that I cannot expect that any lover of such art should trouble himself to > look at it as a whole.

First introduced as a minor character in The Small House at Allington, one of the Barsetshire novels, Palliser is the heir presumptive to the dukedom of Omnium. Palliser is a quiet, hardworking, conscientious man whose chief ambition in life is to become Chancellor of the Exchequer. After an unwise flirtation with the married Lady Dumbello (daughter of Dr Grantly and granddaughter of the Reverend Mr Harding, characters in The Warden and Barchester Towers), he agrees to an arranged marriage with the great heiress of the day, the free-spirited, spontaneous Lady Glencora M'Cluskie. At first she finds him boring and considers running away with her other suitor, the dashing but penniless Burgo Fitzgerald. After he learns of his wife's feelings and plans, Palliser persuades her to travel in Europe to cement their relationship, and is promptly offered the post of Chancellor, which he declines with great regret, since his first priority is his wife. Despite their greatly different natures, the couple settle down to a happy married life. The last book in the series, The Duke's Children, deals with the lives and loves of their three children. Palliser is eventually offered the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer anyway. However, upon inheriting the dukedom, he is forced to relinquish the beloved post, as it is against constitutional convention for a member of the House of Lords to hold it. In The Prime Minister, when neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives are able to form a majority, a weak coalition government is the only solution. Palliser is asked to become Prime Minister because he is an undivisive figure, but he is too sensitive to enjoy his tenure. Socially awkward, he is especially vexed by his wife's lavish parties, which represent her attempt to help influence others to support him. Due to the fragile nature of the coalition, Palliser accomplishes little other than to keep the kingdom on an even keel. By the time he leaves office it is with regret, since he has grown accustomed to the power of his position and is greatly disappointed that he has not been able to do more. He declines a place in the Liberal cabinet which follows his, feeling it inappropriate to serve in a cabinet once he has led one, but, after some thought, he leaves the door open to a return to participation in the government in future. When the Liberals regain power at the end of The Duke's Children, he accepts a Cabinet post as Lord President of the Council. When the Duchess dies unexpectedly, Palliser comes to realise how necessary she has been to his happiness. She has been his only true friend: all others were either merely political allies or her friends. The widower is left to deal with the marriages of two of his three grown children, neither of which initially meets with his approval.

Dramatisations In 1974 the BBC adapted the Palliser novels as a twenty-six part serial The Pallisers, also using some material from Trollope's Barsetshire novel The Small House at Allington (1864). Unusually, this was in turn novelised in a single volume by John Garforth under the alias Tony Hussey. There was also a 12-part BBC Radio 4 \\"Classic Serial\\" dramatisation in 2004, which has been re-broadcast a number of times on BBC Radio 4 Extra. The serial was narrated by David Troughton as Trollope, with Ben Miles as Plantagenet Palliser and Sophie Thompson as Lady Glencora. A new six-part adaptation by Mike Harris under the title The Pallisers began on BBC Radio 4 on 10 November 2019.

Life Born in Twyford, Addington was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M.A. on 13 May 1740 and of M.D. on 24 January 1744. He was subsequently admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians, and went into practice in London, but was compelled by bad health to move to the country. His career gained considerable public attention when he appeared as an expert for the prosecution of Mary Blandy for the poisoning of her father Francis Blandy in 1752. He then retired to Reading in Berkshire, where he derived a large income from his profession, until his death in 1790. He devoted his attention particularly to the treatment of insanity, and was one of the physicians called in to see George III when he first showed symptoms of mental aberration. Addington was a confidential friend and adviser of Lord Chatham. He took part in unsuccessful negotiations of a coalition between Chatham and Lord Bute. Works Addington wrote An Essay on the Sea Scurvy, wherein is proposed an easy method of curing that distemper at sea, and of preserving water sweet for any cruise or voyage. Reading, 1753. In this work, he describes the disease from accounts of others, rather than from his own observation. As treatment he recommended depletion, with the employment of seawater as a purgative, and drinks acidulated with muriatic acid. He conceives meat to be injurious, but regards biscuit as food suitable to persons affected with scurvy. He asserted that the addition of an ounce and a half of muriatic acid to a tun of water, will prevent its putrefaction, and preserve it sweet for any length of time. An authentic Account of the Part taken by the late Earl Chatham in a Transaction which passed in the beginning of the year 1778 is no longer attributed to Addington. Family Addington married in 1745, Mary, daughter of the Rev. Haviland John Hiley, headmaster of Reading grammar school. Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1804, was their eldest son. John Hiley Addington was the second son. *Anne, the eldest, married in 1770 William Goodenough M.D., who died that year. *Eleanor, the second, married James Sutton (died 1801) of Devizes. *Elizabeth married William Hoskins. *Charlotte, the youngest, married in 1788 Charles Bragge Bathurst. *William, b. 1750 in Fringford, Oxfordshire, England, died 1805 in Williamsburg, James Co., Virginia, United States.

Owned by Murray Hill Broadcasting, it is operated under a local marketing agreement (LMA) by Venture Technologies Group. WLFM-LD's transmitter is located on West Ridgewood Drive in suburban Parma. History  Early history and attempted digital conversion  The former allotment, channel 65, was originally for a planned station of WERE-AM back in the 1950s. The station never materialized and thus WERE-TV never aired. The channel 65 allotment was eventually used in 1998 when W47BE moved from channel 47 as W65DL. In 2000, the call letters were changed to WXOX, which were originally assigned to a radio station on AM 1250 in Bay City, Michigan. In the final years as WXOX, the station was affiliated with the Home Shopping Network (HSN). HSN had previously aired in Cleveland on WQHS-TV (channel 61), which was purchased by Univision in 2002. WXOX submitted an application to move to channel 44 and increase power to 120 kW, but then modified the application to convert the analog transmission to digital.http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getattachment_exh.cgi?exhibit_id=620547 FCC findings stated that channel 44 would cause interference with nearby WNEO. So WXOX instead decided to briefly carry a digital feed on WCDN-LD2. WXOX was then forced off the air on October 27, 2009 when wireless carrier Verizon purchased the part of the wireless spectrum where the station had been broadcasting. An attempt was made to convert WXOX to a low-power digital station on channel 31, which was previously used by WJW before the June 12 analog shutoff date. However, due to potential co-channel interference issues with CITY-DT-2 across the lake in Woodstock, Ontario (which also broadcasts on UHF 31, in digital), the application was abandoned. As a radio station In May 2011, the station's owners, Venture Technologies Inc., filed a new FCC request to move the station to Channel 6 analog leading to speculation that it would be used to carry the audio feed of an FM radio station since the sound of channel 6 analog can be heard at 87.7 FM on any FM radio. WLFM-LP was scheduled to launch in July 2012, but the station did not debut until September 9, 2012 (during at least part of the month in between, the station stunted with, among other things, a loop of \\"My Town\\" by The Michael Stanley Band, as well as a cassette tape-recorded loop of snippets of each number 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 list from 1955 to 1992, with occasional station IDs in between and the TV signal showing either a loop of slides of local buildings and sights, or a screensaver for Western Digital).WLFM Cleveland Franken-FM Stunting 8/17/12WLFM-LP Analog 6 Cleveland Slideshow- YouTube The website Radio World described WLFM-LP as a \\"Franken-FM... an unholy mix of radio and TV stations.\\" The WLFM-LP studios are located at the Cleveland Agora. 87.7 Cleveland's Sound From its launch until January 1, 2014, the station ‚Äì branded 87.7 Cleveland's Sound ‚Äì aired a mixed format of alternative rock and AAA music, focusing more on alternative rock towards the end.

WLFM-LP was named best local radio station in 2013 by readers of Cleveland Scene. * From mid-October 2012 until its cancellation in late September 2013, the station aired Inner Sanctum, a locally produced music program featuring Cleveland area bands. Cleveland Scene observed that although it bills itself as \\"a local station for Clevelanders by Clevelanders\\", WLFM-LP \\"pulled the plug\\" on a local show. Program director Ryan Benes said the station was going \\"in a different direction\\". Host Pat Johnson said the station \\"was hoping for a big summer and that hasn't translated into sales yet\\". Previously broadcast on WENZ, WKRK-FM, and WNWV, Inner Sanctum had recently celebrated its 20-year anniversary. The final song to air on WLFM-LP as 87.7 Cleveland's Sound was \\"Hate Me\\" by Blue October.

The \\"Franken-FM\\" radio station now airs a Spanish language format, consisting largely of Latin music. WLFM-LP is currently branded La Mega 87.7, and uses the slogan \\"Latino and Proud\\". Since the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season, WLFM-LP served as the Spanish language radio home of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Rafael Hernandez Brito was the team's Spanish language play-by-play announcer. Beginning in 2018, La Mega 87.7 started to also serve as the Spanish language radio outlet for the Cleveland Browns.

Conversion to digital WLFM- LP signed off their analog broadcast on RF 6 on June 30, 2020, due to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requiring the station to convert to a digital broadcast, rendering the operation as a radio station unusable due to the different technologies used from analog FM, HD Radio, and ATSC. La Mega 87.7 (rebranded as La Mega Cleveland) is now heard exclusively as an online stream on both their website and mobile phone apps.

The Campaign For A New Workers' Party was an initiative of the Socialist Party of England and Wales that argued for the establishment of a new mass workers' party, involving trade union activists, socialists, anti-capitalists, anti-war and environmental activists. It was launched at the party's annual Socialism event in November 2005. There were more than 4,000 signatories to the campaign's founding declaration, many of whom were trade unionists.Building the Campaign for a New Workers' Party ‚Äì retrieved 14/02/08 Some left parties claimed that the CNWP was a front for the Socialist Party. Like the Socialist Alliance in the early 1990s, the CNWP joined local electoral fronts, such as Save Huddersfield NHS, which had a CNWP supporter and SP member as a councillor. The CNWP supported the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition in the 2010 General Election.  Founding The campaign stemmed from the dissolution of the Socialist Alliance in 2004 when Respect - The Unity Coalition was founded. A conference in Liverpool in March 2004 called for a 'Campaign for a Mass Party of the Working Class'. The first formal conference was in London on 19 March 2006, chaired by Dave Nellist, a former Labour MP and current Socialist Party councillor in Coventry. The conference debated nine resolutions about the future shape of the campaign, and elected officers and a steering committee. Policies included a \\"living minimum wage\\", full trade union rights and the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Delegates argued that due to what they saw as previous false starts in trying to establish a party to represent working people‚Äîsuch as Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party‚Äîany new party would have to be democratic, open and inclusive, taking a federal approach, to bring in as many supportive organisations and groups as possible, with no one group or individual dominating. Delegates came from the refounded Socialist Alliance, the Alliance for Workers' Liberty, the Communist Party of Britain, the Socialist Unity Network, the United Socialist Party, and Walsall's Democratic Labour Party. Over 300 of the delegates at the conference were active trade unionists, including members of trade union national executive committees. The campaign allowed trade unions to affiliate to it and over half of the new steering committee were elected by trade union commissions.  2007 and 2008 conferences  The second national conference of the campaign took place on 12 May 2007 at the University of London. Speakers included Chris Baugh (Public and Commercial Services Union Assistant Secretary) and Dave Nellist (Socialist Party councillor) as well as a video address from Ricky Tomlinson. The conference discussed and debated the adoption of a charter and some of the issues likely to be central to the campaign. The 2008 conference took place on Sunday 22 June 2008 and was addressed by RMT leader Bob Crow .  The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition  In 2009, 'No to EU ‚Äì Yes to Democracy' (NO2EU), the forerunner of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) was founded initially as a result of an electoral alliance between the RMT, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Britain, for the purpose of contesting the European elections, and in 2010 TUSC was formed. In the view of the CNWP it was a progenitor of a new workers party, and leading participants in the CNWP such as Dave Nellist, became leading participants in TUSC.

The company's business interests include nickel and cobalt mining, oil and gas exploration and production, and electricity generation. Sherritt is one of the largest foreign investors in Cuba. Operations Mining Structures on the grounds of the Sherritt plant, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. Sherritt has most of its profit coming from mining operations. Sherritt licenses its proprietary technologies and provides metallurgical services to mining and refining operations worldwide. The company has a portfolio of mineral rights on which it earns royalties from the production of potash and other minerals. The company has nickel laterite mines in Moa, Cuba and near Moramanga, Madagascar. Sherritt has metal refineries in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada and in Toamasina, Madagascar. Sherritt produces nickel, cobalt, ammonia, sulphuric acid, and ammonium sulphate at its Fort Saskatchewan facility. The nickel and cobalt mining operations at the Ambatovy mine in Madagascar began production in second quarter 2012 and the Ambatovy project received its export permit in Q3 2012. Sherritt holds 12% ownership of the project. Sherrit's partners in the project are Japan's Sumitomo Corporation and the Korea Investment Corporation. The Ambatovy project is an integrated production system encompassing all stages from mining to refinery in the same country. The Ambatovy venture has two nickel deposits located near Moramanga, Madagascar. The ore from these deposits is delivered via pipeline to a processing plant and refinery located near the Port of Toamasina. Oil and gas Sherritt operates oil and gas fields leased from the Cuban government (Varadero, Yumuri, Puerto Escondido) and has interest in some fields in Spain and Pakistan. Sherritt has invested million for the construction of two integrated gas processing and electrical generation systems in Cuba. The natural gas feedstock was previously flared and wasted. These operations commissioned in mid-2002 have a combined capacity of 226 MW. Sherritt has natural gas activities on the island. Sherrit built and operates a natural gas feeder pipeline network, and a pipeline to Havana. In 2010, Cuba‚Äôs onshore and coastal 2010 crude oil production was estimated at approximately 50,000 barrels per day, of which 11,128 barrels per day represents Sherritt‚Äôs net equity in that production. In Cuba, Sherritt extended one of its existing production-sharing contracts until 2028, and signed contracts for two new blocks that have 25-year terms and together encompass more than in the same area that the company is already producing. In 2015, Sherritt reported its cost to produce oil is less than US$9 per barrel. Electricity Sherritt owns 33% of Energas, an electricity producing company in Cuba. Energas supplies 11.6% of Cuba‚Äôs electric power.http://imo2.thejakartapost.com/eversafe/2013/01/29/cuban-national- electric-system-and-6-top-power-plants/ The nickel mined by the company can be used to make cheaper solar cells. Nickel is used to make batteries and new developments in batteries use nickel. Sherritt has two major joint ventures that produce cobalt. Cobalt is a primary component of battery cathodes, and cobalt is needed for electric vehicles. Fertilizer Sherritt owns assets, which produce fertilizer products, primarily for sale in the Western Canadian market, and which provide some of the critical input requirements for the Fort Saskatchewan metals refinery. Revenue is derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers, and of sulphate fertilizers produced directly or indirectly as a by-product of the metals refining process. History The company was named after Carl Sherritt, an American citizen and teamster on local rail construction projects who, after becoming a trapper and prospector, staked copper prospects in the Cold Lake area of Manitoba; and J.

It has existed on its present site in Commercial Road, South Yarra, some 200 metres from Chapel Street, for over 125 years. The market has a variety of stalls and shops selling fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, fish and deli foods, as well as cafes. The market is not open on Mondays and Wednesdays (Sundays has selected traders only). Prahran Market is known as \\"the food lover's market\\" because of the quality and range of the food on sale. For those looking for a special item, Prahran Market is the place to find those hard to get specialties including heritage varieties of fruit and veg, unusual poultry, game, seafood and exotic cheeses. Prahran Market is the only market in Melbourne to have a dedicated Market Square where the community enjoy performances, cafes and a children's playground. History The original Prahran (pronounced /p…õ'r√¶n/) Market had its origins in 1864 when the Prahran Council purchased land near the corner of Greville and Grattan Street, which today is covered by a garden and fountain. The council determined that, due to the population growth during the 1850s, a central market place was required for the many small farmers and market gardeners in the area to sell their produce. This first Prahran market was in operation by June 1867.The Telegraph, St Kilda, Prahran and South Yarra Guardian, 22 June 1867, p.2 By 1881 the site had become overcrowded and the market was moved to its present location on Commercial Road. The erection of market buildings and extension of stalls was carried out in 1890 and the new Prahran Market was opened in 1891. The present fa√ßade on Commercial Road, which exhibits mannerist and Anglo- Dutch influences, is much the same as it was in 1891 and includes the complete mansard roof. The market was further extended in 1923 and in the late 1920s refrigeration became available for perishable goods. The balcony above the Commercial Road shops was the site for Friday night concerts by The Salvation Army. The market became a distribution point for groceries, clothing and boots for the unemployed during the depression years of the 1930s. During the Second World War, most of the men in the market were conscripted into the armed forces and their wives and children undertook the job of buying, carting and selling produce. The fruit and vegetable section of the Market was destroyed in a fire on Boxing Day 1950, after which a temporary structure was erected.Prahran Market Reopens Today - The Age 29 December, 1950Open to Business and the Sky But it was not until 1972 that the Prahran Council sought tenders for the redevelopment of the market site. The final stage of the redevelopment was completed in 1976 at a total cost of A$6.5 million. In the 1990s an independent Board was appointed to run the Market, major structural repairs and renovations to the market complex were completed, and a multi- level carpark between Elizabeth and Barry Street was added. Transport The Sandringham railway service stops at nearby South Yarra and Prahran railway stations. The 72 tram runs along Commercial Road and stops right outside the market.

The parashah deals with ritual impurity. It addresses cleansing from skin disease (, tzara'at), houses with an eruptive plague, male genital discharges, and menstruation. The parashah constitutes The parashah is made up of 4,697 Hebrew letters, 1,274 Hebrew words, 90 verses, and 159 lines in a Torah Scroll (, Sefer Torah). Jews generally read it in April or, rarely, in early May. The lunisolar Hebrew calendar contains up to 55 weeks, the exact number varying between 50 in common years and 54 or 55 in leap years. In leap years (for example, 2022, 2024, and 2027), parashah Metzora is read separately. In common years (for example, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2025, 2026, 2028), parashah Metzora is combined with the previous parashah, Tazria, to help achieve the needed number of weekly readings. Readings In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , aliyot.See, e.g., Menachem Davis, editor, The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Vayikra/Leviticus (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2008), pages 89‚Äì106. hyssop (1885 painting by Otto Wilhelm Thom√©) First reading ‚Äî Leviticus 14:1‚Äì12 In the first reading (, aliyah), God told Moses the ritual for cleansing one with a skin disease. If the priest saw that the person had healed, the priest would order two live clean birds, cedar wood, crimson stuff, and hyssop. The priest would order one of the birds slaughtered over fresh water and would then dip the live bird, the cedar wood, the crimson stuff, and the hyssop in the blood of the slaughtered bird. The priest would then sprinkle the blood seven times on the one who was to be cleansed and then set the live bird free. The one to be cleansed would then wash his clothes, shave off his hair, bathe in water, and then be clean. On the eighth day after that, the one being cleansed was to present two male lambs, one ewe lamb, choice flour, and oil for the priest to offer. Second reading ‚Äî Leviticus 14:13‚Äì20 In the second reading (, aliyah), the priest was to kill the lamb and put some of its blood and the oil on the ridge of the right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe of the one being cleansed, and then put more of the oil on his head. Third reading ‚Äî Leviticus 14:21‚Äì32 In the third reading (, aliyah), if the one being cleansed was poor, he could bring two turtle doves or pigeons in place of two of the lambs. Fourth reading ‚Äî Leviticus 14:33‚Äì53 In the fourth reading (, aliyah), God then told Moses and Aaron the ritual for cleansing a house with an eruptive plague. The owner was to tell the priest, who was to order the house cleared and then examine it. If the plague in the walls was greenish or reddish streaks deep into the wall, the priest was to close the house for seven days. If, after seven days, the plague had spread, the priest was to order the stones with the plague to be pulled out and cast outside the city. The house was then to be scraped, the stones replaced, and the house replastered. If the plague again broke out, the house was to be torn down. If the plague did not break out again, the priest was to pronounce the house clean. To purge the house, the priest was to take two birds, cedar wood, crimson stuff, and hyssop, slaughter one bird over fresh water, sprinkle on the house seven times with the bird's blood, and then let the live bird go free. Fifth reading ‚Äî Leviticus 14:54‚Äì15:15 In the fifth reading (, aliyah), God then told Moses and Aaron the ritual for cleansing a person who had a genital discharge. When a man had a discharge from his genitals, he was unclean, and any bedding on which he lay and every object on which he sat was to be unclean. Anyone who touched his body, touched his bedding, touched an object on which he sat, was touched by his spit, or was touched by him before he rinsed his hands was to wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. An earthen vessel that he touched was to be broken, and any wooden implement was to be rinsed with water. Seven days after the discharge ended, he was to wash his clothes, bathe his body in fresh water, and be clean. On the eighth day, he was to give two turtle doves or two pigeons to the priest, who was to offer them to make expiation. Sixth reading ‚Äî Leviticus 15:16‚Äì28 In the sixth reading (, aliyah), when a man had an emission of semen, he was to bathe and remain unclean until evening. All material on which semen fell was to be washed in water and remain unclean until evening. And if a man had carnal relations with a woman, they were both to bathe and remain unclean until evening. When a woman had a menstrual discharge, she was to remain impure seven days, and whoever touched her was to be unclean until evening. Anything that she lay on or sat on was unclean. Anyone who touched her bedding or any object on which she has sat was to wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. And if a man lay with her, her impurity was communicated to him and he was to be unclean seven days, and any bedding on which he lay became unclean. When a woman had an irregular discharge of blood, she was to be unclean as long as her discharge lasted. Seven days after the discharge ended, she was to be clean. Seventh reading ‚Äî Leviticus 15:29‚Äì33 In the seventh reading (, aliyah), on the eighth day, the woman was to give two turtle doves or two pigeons to the priest, who was to offer them to make expiation. God told Moses and Aaron to put the Israelites on guard against uncleanness, lest they die by defiling God's Tabernacle. In inner-biblical interpretation The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these Biblical sources:For more on inner- Biblical interpretation, see, e.g., Benjamin D. Sommer, \\"Inner-biblical Interpretation,\\" in Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, editors, The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), pages 1835‚Äì41. Leviticus chapter 14 associates skin disease with uncleanness, and associates various sexuality-related events with uncleanness. In the Hebrew Bible, uncleanness has a variety of associations. 11; 11; and and associate it with death. And perhaps similarly, associates it with childbirth and associates it with skin disease. associates it with various sexuality- related events. And 23; and and associate it with contact with the worship of alien gods. The Hebrew Bible reports skin disease (, tzara'at) and a person affected by skin disease (, metzora) at several places, often (and sometimes incorrectly) translated as \\"leprosy\\" and \\"a leper.\\" In to help Moses to convince others that God had sent him, God instructed Moses to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, his hand was \\"leprous (, m'tzora'at), as white as snow.\\" In the Torah sets out regulations for skin diseases (, tzara'at) and a person affected by skin disease (, metzora). In after Miriam spoke against Moses, God's cloud removed from the Tent of Meeting and \\"Miriam was leprous (, m'tzora'at), as white as snow.\\" In Moses warned the Israelites in the case of skin disease (, tzara'at) diligently to observe all that the priests would teach them, remembering what God did to Miriam. In 2 Kings part of the haftarah for parashah Tazria, the prophet Elisha cures Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was a \\"leper\\" (, metzora). In part of the haftarah for parashah Metzora, the story is told of four \\"leprous men\\" (, m'tzora'im) at the gate during the Arameans' siege of Samaria. And in 2 Chronicles after King Uzziah tried to burn incense in the Temple in Jerusalem, \\"leprosy (, tzara'at) broke forth on his forehead.\\" Illustration from a 1984 Bible story book, showing Moses putting blood on Aaron's right ear The Torah mentions the combination of ear, thumb, and toe in three places. In God instructed Moses how to initiate the priests, telling him to kill a ram, take some of its blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot, and dash the remaining blood against the altar round about. And then reports that Moses followed God's instructions to initiate Aaron and his sons. Then, 17, 25, and 28 set forth a similar procedure for the cleansing of a person with skin disease (, tzara'at). In God instructed the priest on the day of the person's cleansing to take some of the blood of a guilt-offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed. And then in God instructed the priest to put oil on the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot of the one to be cleansed, on top of the blood of the guilt-offering. And finally, in and 28, God instructed the priest to repeat the procedure on the eighth day to complete the person's cleansing.

In classical rabbinic interpretation The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:For more on classical rabbinic interpretation, see, e.g., Yaakov Elman, \\"Classical Rabbinic Interpretation,\\" in Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, editors, The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition, pages 1859‚Äì78. Leviticus chapter 14 Tractate Negaim in the Mishnah and Tosefta interpreted the laws of skin disease in Mishnah Negaim 1:1‚Äì14:13 (Land of Israel, circa 200 CE), in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, The Mishnah: A New Translation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), pages 981‚Äì1012; Tosefta Negaim 1:1‚Äì9:9 (Land of Israel, circa 250 CE), in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction (Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson Publishers, 2002), volume 2, pages 1709‚Äì44. calls on the Israelites to obey God's \\"statutes\\" (, chukim) and \\"ordinances\\" (, mishpatim). The Rabbis in a Baraita taught that the \\"ordinances\\" (, mishpatim) were commandments that logic would have dictated that we follow even had Scripture not commanded them, like the laws concerning idolatry, adultery, bloodshed, robbery, and blasphemy. And \\"statutes\\" (, chukim) were commandments that the Adversary challenges us to violate as beyond reason, like those relating to purification of the person with skin disease (, tzara'at, in ), wool-linen mixtures (, shaatnez, in and ), release from levirate marriage (, chalitzah, in ), and the he goat for Azazel (in ). So that people do not think these \\"ordinances\\" (, mishpatim) to be empty acts, in God says, \\"I am the Lord,\\" indicating that the Lord made these statutes, and we have no right to question them.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 67b (Babylonia, 6th century), in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yoma, commentary by Adin Even- Israel (Steinsaltz) (Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2013), volume 9, page 325; see also Sifra Aharei Mot pereq 13, 194:2:11, in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, Sifra: An Analytical Translation (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988), volume 3, page 79. The Midrash noted that many things appear lowly, but God commanded many precepts to be performed with them. The hyssop, for instance, appears to be of no worth to people, yet its power is great in the eyes of God, who put it on a level with cedar in the purification of the leper in and the burning of the Red Cow in 18, and employed it in the Exodus from Egypt in Exodus Rabbah 17:2 (10th century), in, e.g., Simon M. Lehrman, translator, Midrash Rabbah: Exodus (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 3, pages 212‚Äì13. Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Joseph ben Zimra that anyone who bears evil tales (, lashon hara) will be visited by the plague of skin disease (, tzara‚Äôat), as it is said in Psalm \\"Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy (azmit).\\" The Gemara read azmit to allude to , tzara‚Äôat, and cited how says \\"in perpetuity\\" (la-zemitut). And Resh Lakish interpreted the words of \\"This shall be the law of the person with skin disease (metzora),\\" to mean, \\"This shall be the law for him who brings up an evil name (motzi shem ra).\\" And the Gemara reported that in the Land of Israel they taught that slander kills three persons: the slanderer, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom the slander is told.Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 15b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman, Feivel Wahl, Yosef Davis, Henoch Moshe Levin, Israel Schneider, Yeshayahu Levy, Eliezer Herzka, Dovid Nachfolger, Eliezer Lachman, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2004), volume 67, pages 15b2‚Äì5. Similarly, Rabbi Haninah taught that skin disease came only from slander. The Rabbis found a proof for this from the case of Miriam, arguing that because she uttered slander against Moses, plagues attacked her. And the Rabbis read to support this when it says in connection with skin disease, \\"remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam.\\"Deuteronomy Rabbah 6:8 (Land of Israel, circa 775‚Äì900 CE), in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 7, pages 125‚Äì26. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that skin disease results from seven things: slander, the shedding of blood, vain oath, incest, arrogance, robbery, and envy. The Gemara cited scriptural bases for each of the associations: For slander, for bloodshed, 2 Samuel for a vain oath, for incest, for arrogance, 2 Chronicles for robbery, (as a Tanna taught that those who collect money that does not belong to them will see a priest come and scatter their money around the street); and for envy, Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 16a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman et al, volume 67, page 16a. Worshiping the golden calf (illustration from a 1901 Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company) Miriam Shut Out from the Camp (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) Similarly, a Midrash taught that skin disease resulted from 10 sins: (1) idol-worship, (2) unchastity, (3) bloodshed, (4) the profanation of the Divine Name, (5) blasphemy of the Divine Name, (6) robbing the public, (7) usurping a dignity to which one has no right, (8) overweening pride, (9) evil speech, and (10) an evil eye. The Midrash cited as proofs: (1) for idol-worship, the experience of the Israelites who said of the Golden Calf, \\"This is your god, O Israel,\\" in and then were smitten with leprosy, as reported in where \\"Moses saw that the people had broken out (parua, ),\\" indicating that leprosy had \\"broken out\\" (parah) among them; (2) for unchastity, from the experience of the daughters of Zion of whom says, \\"the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and ogling eyes,\\" and then says, \\"Therefore will the Lord smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion\\"; (3) for bloodshed, from the experience of Joab, of whom says, \\"Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper,\\" (4) for the profanation of the Divine Name, from the experience of Gehazi, of whom says, \\"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said: ‚ÄòBehold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take of him somewhat (me'umah, ),\\" and \\"somewhat\\" (me'umah, ) means \\"of the blemish\\" (mum, ) that Naaman had, and thus Gehazi was smitten with leprosy, as reports Elisha said to Gehazi, \\"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to you\\"; (5) for blaspheming the Divine Name, from the experience of Goliath, of whom says, \\"And the Philistine cursed David by his God,\\" and the says, \\"This day will the Lord deliver (sagar, ) you,\\" and the term \\"deliver\\" (, sagar) is used here in the same sense as uses it with regard to leprosy, when it is says, \\"And the priest shall shut him up (, sagar)\\"; (6) for robbing the public, from the experience of Shebna, who derived illicit personal benefit from property of the Sanctuary, and of whom says, \\"the Lord . . . will wrap you round and round,\\" and \\"wrap\\" must refer to a leper, of whom says, \\"And he shall wrap himself over the upper lip\\"; (7) for usurping a dignity to which one has no right, from the experience of Uzziah, of whom says, \\"And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death\\"; (8) for overweening pride, from the same example of Uzziah, of whom says, \\"But when he became strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly and he trespassed against the Lord his God\\"; (9) for evil speech, from the experience of Miriam, of whom says, \\"And Miriam . . . spoke against Moses,\\" and then says, \\"when the cloud was removed from over the Tent, behold Miriam was leprous\\"; and (10) for an evil eye, from the person described in which can be read, \\"And he that keeps his house to himself shall come to the priest, saying: There seems to me to be a plague in the house,\\" and thus describes one who is not willing to permit any other to have any benefit from the house.Leviticus Rabbah 17:3 (Land of Israel, 5th century), in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 4, pages 215‚Äì17. Similarly, Rabbi Judah the Levite, son of Rabbi Shalom, inferred that skin disease comes because of eleven sins: (1) for cursing the Divine Name, (2) for immorality, (3) for bloodshed, (4) for ascribing to another a fault that is not in him, (5) for haughtiness, (6) for encroaching upon other people's domains, (7) for a lying tongue, (8) for theft, (9) for swearing falsely, (10) for profanation of the name of Heaven, and (11) for idolatry. Rabbi Isaac added: for ill-will. And our Rabbis said: for despising the words of the Torah.Numbers Rabbah 7:5. It was taught in a Baraita that four types of people are accounted as though they were dead: a poor person, a person affected by skin disease (, metzora), a blind person, and one who is childless. A poor person is accounted as dead, for says, \\"for all the men are dead who sought your life\\" (and the Gemara interpreted this to mean that they had been stricken with poverty). A person affected by skin disease (, metzora) is accounted as dead, for says, \\"And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous (, metzora'at). And Aaron said to Moses . . . let her not be as one dead.\\" The blind are accounted as dead, for says, \\"He has set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.\\" And one who is childless is accounted as dead, for in Rachel said, \\"Give me children, or else I am dead.\\"Babylonian Talmud Nedarim 64b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Eliezer Herzka, Asher Dicker, Nasanel Kasnett, Noson Boruch Herzka, Reuvein Dowek, Michoel Weiner, Mendy Wachsman, and Feivel Wahl, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000), volume 30, page 64b3. A Midrash taught that Divine Justice first attacks a person's substance and then the person's body. So when leprous plagues come upon a person, first they come upon the fabric of the person's house. If the person repents, then requires that only the affected stones need to be pulled out; if the person does not repent, then requires pulling down the house. Then the plagues come upon the person's clothes. If the person repents, then the clothes require washing; if not, they require burning. Then the plagues come upon the person's body. If the person repents, provides for purification; if not, then ordains that the person \\"shall dwell alone.\\"Leviticus Rabbah 17:4, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, volume 4, page 219; Ruth Rabbah 2:10. Similarly, the Tosefta reported that when a person would come to the priest, the priest would tell the person to engage in self- examination and turn from evil ways. The priest would continue that plagues come only from gossip, and skin disease from arrogance. But God would judge in mercy. The plague would come to the house, and if the homeowner repented, the house required only dismantling, but if the homeowner did not repent, the house required demolition. They would appear on clothing, and if the owner repented, the clothing required only tearing, but if the owner did not repent, the clothing required burning. They would appear on the person's body, and if the person repented, well and good, but if the person did not repent, required that the person \\"shall dwell alone.\\"Tosefta Negaim 6:7, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 1731‚Äì32. Pigeons (painting circa 1832‚Äì1837 by John Gould) In the priest's examination of skin disease mandated by 9, and the Mishnah taught that a priest could examine anyone else's symptoms, but not his own. And Rabbi Meir taught that the priest could not examine his relatives.Mishnah Negaim 2:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 984; Deuteronomy Rabbah 6:8, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, volume 7, pages 125‚Äì26. The Mishnah taught that anyone could inspect skin disease, but only a priest could declare it unclean or clean.Mishnah Negaim 3:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 984. The Mishnah taught that the priests delayed examining a bridegroom ‚Äî as well as his house and his garment ‚Äî until after his seven days of rejoicing, and delayed examining anyone until after a holy day.Mishnah Negaim 3:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 984‚Äì85. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that required \\"two living clean birds\\" to be brought to purify the person afflicted with skin disease because the afflicted person did the work of a babbler in spreading evil tales, and therefore required that the afflicted person offer babbling birds as a sacrifice.Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 16b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman, Feivel Wahl, Yosef Davis, Henoch Moshe Levin, Israel Schneider, Yeshayahu Levy, Eliezer Herzka, Dovid Nachfolger, Eliezer Lachman, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 67, page 16b. The Gemara interpreted the expression \\"two living birds\\" in The Gemara interpreted the word \\"living\\" to mean those whose principal limbs are living (excluding birds that are missing a limb) and to exclude treifah birds (birds with an injury or defect that would prevent them from living out a year). The Gemara interpreted the word \\"birds\\" (, zipparim) to mean kosher birds. The Gemara deduced from the words of \\"Every bird (, zippor) that is clean you may eat,\\" that some zipparim are forbidden as unclean ‚Äî namely, birds slaughtered pursuant to The Gemara interpreted the words of \\"And these are they of which you shall not eat,\\" to refer to birds slaughtered pursuant to And the Gemara taught that repeats the commandment so as to teach that one who consumes a bird slaughtered pursuant to infringes both a positive and a negative commandment.Babylonian Talmud Chullin 139b‚Äì40a. Rabbi Isaac taught that God told Noah that just as a pair of birds (ken) cleansed a person with skin disease (as instructed in ), so Noah's Ark would cleanse Noah (so that he would be worthy to be saved from the Flood).Genesis Rabbah 14:4 (Land of Israel, 5th century), in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Genesis (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 1, pages 242‚Äì43. blue techelet thread on a set of tzitzit Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel interpreted the words \\"completely blue (, techelet)\\" in to teach that blue dye used to test the dye is unfit for further use to dye the blue, techelet strand of a tzitzit, interpreting the word \\"completely\\" to mean \\"full strength.\\" But Rabbi Johanan ben Dahabai taught that even the second dyeing using the same dye is valid, reading the words \\"and scarlet\\" (, ushni tolalat) in to mean \\"a second [dying] of red wool.\\"Babylonian Talmud Menachot 42b. A Midrash noted that God commanded the Israelites to perform certain precepts with similar material from trees: God commanded that the Israelites throw cedar wood and hyssop into the Red Heifer mixture of and use hyssop to sprinkle the resulting waters of lustration in God commanded that the Israelites use cedar wood and hyssop to purify those stricken with skin disease in and in Egypt God commanded the Israelites to use the bunch of hyssop to strike the lintel and the two side- posts with blood in Exodus Rabbah 17:1. goat for Azazel on Yom Kippur (illustration by William James Webb) A Midrash interpreted the words, \\"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall,\\" in to teach that Solomon interpreted the requirement in to use cedar wood and hyssop to purify those stricken with skin disease. Solomon asked why the person stricken with skin disease was purified by means of the tallest and lowest of trees. And Solomon answered that the person's raising himself up like a cedar caused him to be smitten with skin disease, but making himself small and humbling himself like the hyssop caused him be healed.Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:35. See also Numbers Rabbah 19:3. When Rav Dimi came from the Land of Israel, he said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that there were three red threads: one in connection with the red cow in the second in connection with the \\"scapegoat for Azazel\\" in the Yom Kippur service of (which Mishnah Yoma 4:2Mishnah Yoma 4:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 9, page 203. indicates was marked with a red thread), and the third in connection with the person with skin disease (, metzora) in Rav Dimi reported that one weighed ten zuz, another weighed two selas, and the third weighed a shekel, but he could not say which was which. When Rabin came, he said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that the thread in connection with the red cow weighed ten zuz, that of the goat for Azazel weighed two selas, and that of the person with skin disease weighed a shekel. Rabbi Johanan said that Rabbi Simeon ben Halafta and the Sages disagreed about the thread of the red cow, one saying that it weighed ten shekels, the other that it weighed one shekel. Rabbi Jeremiah of Difti said to Rabina that they disagreed not about the thread of the red cow, but about that of the goat for Azazel.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 41b‚Äì42a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yoma. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 9, page 205. The Gemara taught that there were three who were required to cut their hair, and whose hair cutting was a religious duty: nazirites (as stated in ), those afflicted with skin disease (, metzora, as stated in ), and the Levites. Citing the Mishnah,Mishnah Negaim 14:4, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1010. the Gemara taught that if any of them cut their hair without a razor, or left behind two hairs, their act was invalid.Babylonian Talmud Nazir 40a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Mordechai Rabinovitch, edited by Hersh Goldwurm, volume 32, pages 40a2. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1993.

The Mishnah taught that one who sacrificed much and one who sacrificed little attained equal merit, so long as they directed their hearts to Heaven.Mishnah Menachot 13:11, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012. Rabbi Zera taught that provided a Scriptural proof for this when it says, \\"Sweet is the sleep of a serving man, whether he eat little or much.\\" Rav Adda bar Ahavah taught that provided a Scriptural proof for this when it says, \\"When goods increase, they are increased who eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof.\\" Rabbi Simeon ben Azzai taught that Scripture says of a large ox, \\"An offering made by fire of a sweet savor\\"; of a small bird, \\"An offering made by fire of a sweet savor\\"; and of a meal-offering, \\"An offering made by fire of a sweet savor.\\" Rabbi Simeon ben Azzai thus taught that Scripture uses the same expression each time to teach that it is the same whether people offered much or little, so long as they directed their hearts to Heaven.Babylonian Talmud Menachot 110a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Yosef Davis, Eliezer Herzka, Abba Zvi Naiman, Zev Meisels, Noson Boruch Herzka, and Avrohom Neuberger, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 60, page 110a3‚Äì4. And Rabbi Isaac asked why the meal- offering was distinguished in that uses the word \\"soul\\" (, nefesh) to refer to the donor of a meal-offering, instead of the usual \\"man\\" (, adam, in or , ish, in ) used in connection with other sacrifices. Rabbi Isaac taught that uses the word \\"soul\\" (, nefesh) because God noted that the one who usually brought a meal-offering was a poor man, and God accounted it as if the poor man had offered his own soul.Babylonian Talmud Menachot 104b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Yosef Davis, Eliezer Herzka, Abba Zvi Naiman, Zev Meisels, Noson Boruch Herzka, and Avrohom Neuberger, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 60, page 104b2. The Sifra noted that says both, \\"if he be poor,\\" and \\"his means do not suffice.\\" The Sifra explained that reading \\"if he be poor,\\" one might think that the verse allowed a less expensive offering for one who was relatively poorer that earlier, as in the case of one who earlier had 100 manehs and now had 50 manehs. Thus also says, \\"his means do not suffice\\" (as an absolute matter).Sifra Mesora Parashah 4; 154:1:1, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 347.

Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 835. In a Baraita, Rabbi Jose related that a certain Elder from Jerusalem told him that 24 types of patients are afflicted with boils. The Gemara then related that Rabbi Jo·∏•anan warned to be careful of the flies found on those afflicted with the disease ra‚Äôatan, as flies carried the disease. Rabbi Zeira would not sit in a spot where the wind blew from the direction of someone afflicted with ra‚Äôatan. Rabbi Elazar would not enter the tent of one afflicted with ra‚Äôatan, and Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi would not eat eggs from an alley in which someone afflicted with ra‚Äôatan lived. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, however, would attach himself to those afflicted with ra‚Äôatan and study Torah, saying this was justified by ‚ÄúThe Torah is a loving hind and a graceful doe.‚Äù Rabbi Joshua reasoned that if Torah bestows grace on those who learn it, it could protect them from illness. When Rabbi Joshua ben Levi was on the verge of dying, the Gemara told, the Angel of Death was instructed to perform Rabbi Joshua‚Äôs bidding, as he was a righteous man and deserves to die in the manner he saw fit. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asked the Angel of Death to show him his place in paradise, and the Angel agreed. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asked the Angel to give him the knife that the Angel used to kill people, lest the Angel frighten him on the way, and the Angel gave it to him. When they arrived in paradise, the Angel lifted Rabbi Joshua so that he could see his place in paradise, and Rabbi Joshua jumped to the other side, escaping into paradise. Elijah the Prophet then told those in paradise to make way for Rabbi Joshua.Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 77b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli.

The Gemara told that Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asked Elijah when the Messiah would come, and Elijah told Rabbi Joshua ben Levi that he could find the Messiah sitting at the entrance of the city of Rome among the poor who suffer from illnesses.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 98a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1995), volume 49, page 98a5. The Levant in the 9th Century B.C.E. In God announced that God would \\"put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession.\\" Rabbi Hiyya asked: Was it then a piece of good news that plagues were to come upon them? Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai answered that when the Canaanites heard that the Israelites were approaching, they hid their valuables in their houses. But God promised the Israelites' forbearers that God would bring the Israelites into a land full of good things, including (in the words of ) \\"houses full of all good things.\\" So God brought plagues upon a house of one of the Israelites so that when he would pull it down, he would find a treasure.Leviticus Rabbah 17:6, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, volume 4, page 220. Reading and a Midrash taught that in 18 verses, Scripture places Moses and Aaron (the instruments of Israel's deliverance) on an equal footing (reporting that God spoke to both of them alike),See and thus there are 18 benedictions in the Amidah.Numbers Rabbah 2:1, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 5, page 22. The Sifra read the words \\"the land of Canaan\\" in to refer to the Land that God set aside distinctly for the Israelites. The Sifra thus read the words \\"which I give to you\\" in to exclude the lands of Ammon and Moab east of the Jordan River. Thus house plagues could occur only in the Land of Israel west of the Jordan.Sifra Mesora 155:1:1, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 352. And Rabbi Ishmael read the words \\"of your possession\\" in to exclude the possession of Gentiles in the Land of Israel from house plagues.Sifra Mesora 155:1:6, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 352‚Äì53; see also Mishnah Negaim 12:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1004; Babylonian Talmud Gittin 82a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Yitzchok Isbee and Mordechai Kuber, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1993), volume 35, page 82a (citing a Baraita). Because addresses \\"a house of the land,\\" the Mishnah taught that a house built on a ship, on a raft, or on four beams could not be afflicted by a house plague.Mishnah Negaim 12:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1004. A Midrash noted the difference in wording between which says of the Israelites in Goshen that \\"they got possessions therein,\\" and which says of the Israelites in Canaan, \\"When you come into the land of Canaan, which I gave you for a possession.\\" The Midrash read to read, \\"and they were taken in possession by it.\\" The Midrash thus taught that in the case of Goshen, the land seized the Israelites, so that their bond might be exacted and so as to bring about God's declaration to Abraham in that the Egyptians would afflict the Israelites for 400 years. But the Midrash read to teach the Israelites that if they were worthy, the Land of Israel would be an eternal possession, but if not, they would be banished from it.Genesis Rabbah 95. The Rabbis taught that a structure of less than four square cubits could not contract a house plague. The Gemara explained that in speaking of house plagues, uses the word \\"house,\\" and a building of less than four square cubits did not constitute a \\"house.\\"Babylonian Talmud Sukkah 3a‚Äìb. bronze ax heads of the type used between 1500 B.C.E. and 500 B.C.E. in the region of the Adriatic Sea (2008 drawing by Bratislav Taba≈°) A Baraita (which the Gemara later said may have reflected the view of Rabbi Meir, or may have reflected the view of the Rabbis) taught that a synagogue, a house owned by partners, and a house owned by a woman are all subject to uncleanness from house plagues. The Gemara explained that the Baraita needed to expound this because one might have argued that says, \\"then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest,\\" and \\"he who owns the house\\" could be read to imply \\"he\\" but not \\"she\\" and \\"he\\" but not \\"they.\\" And therefore the Baraita teaches that one should not read that narrowly. And the Gemara explained that one should not read that narrowly because speaks broadly of \\"a house of the land of your possession,\\" indicating that all houses in the Land of Israel are susceptible to plagues. The Gemara then asked why bothers to say, \\"he who owns the house.\\" The Gemara explained that intends to teach that if a homeowner keeps his house to himself exclusively, refusing to lend his belongings, pretending that he did not own them, then God exposes the homeowner by subjecting his house to the plague and causing his belongings to be removed for all to see (as requires). Thus excludes from the infliction of house plagues homeowners who lend their belongings to others.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 11b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yoma, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 9, page 50; see also Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 16a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman, Feivel Wahl, Yosef Davis, Henoch Moshe Levin, Israel Schneider, Yeshayahu Levy, Eliezer Herzka, Dovid Nachfolger, Eliezer Lachman, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 67, page 16a (stingy homeowner). Similarly, Rabbi Isaac taught that when a person asked to borrow a friend's ax or sieve, and the friend out of selfishness replied that he did not have one, then immediately the plague would attack the friend's house. And as required that they remove everything that he had in his house, including his axes and his sieves, the people would see his possessions and exclaim how selfish he had been.Deuteronomy Rabbah 6:8, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, volume 7, pages 125‚Äì26; see also Leviticus Rabbah 17:2, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, volume 4, pages 214‚Äì15. But the Gemara asked whether a synagogue could be subject to house plagues. For a Baraita (which the Gemara later identified with the view of the Rabbis) taught that one might assume that synagogues and houses of learning are subject to house plagues, and therefore says, \\"he who has the house will come,\\" to exclude those houses ‚Äî like synagogues ‚Äî that do not belong to any one individual. The Gemara proposed a resolution to the conflict by explaining that the first Baraita reflected the opinion of Rabbi Meir, while the second Baraita reflected the opinion of the Rabbis. For a Baraita taught that a synagogue that contains a dwelling for the synagogue attendant is required to have a mezuzah, but a synagogue that contains no dwelling, Rabbi Meir declares it is required to have a mezuzah, but the Sages exempt it.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 11b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yoma, commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 9, page 50. The Second Temple in Jerusalem (model in the Israel Museum) Alternatively, the Gemara suggested that both teachings were in accord with the Rabbis. In the first case, the synagogue referred to has a dwelling, and then even the Rabbis would say that it would be subject to house plagues. In the other case, the synagogue referred to has no dwelling, and so would not be subject to house plagues. Alternatively, the Gemara tentatively suggested that in both cases, the synagogue has no dwelling, but the first teaching refers to urban synagogues, while the second refers to rural synagogues. But the Gemara asked whether urban synagogues really are not subject to uncleanness from house plagues. For a Baraita taught that the words, \\"in the house of the land of your possession\\" in teach that a house of the land of the Israelites' possession could become defiled through house plagues, but Jerusalem could not become defiled through house plagues, because Jerusalem did not fall within any single Tribe's inheritance. Rabbi Judah, however, said that he had heard that only the Temple in Jerusalem was unaffected by house plagues. Thus Rabbi Judah's view would imply that synagogues and houses of learning are subject to house plagues even in large cities. The Gemara suggested, however, that one should read Rabbi Judah's view to say that sacred places are not subject to house plagues. The Gemara suggested that the principle that the first Tanna and Rabbi Judah were disputing was whether Jerusalem was divided among the Tribes; the first Tanna holds that Jerusalem was not divided, while Rabbi Judah holds that Jerusalem was divided among the Tribes.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 11b‚Äì12a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yoma. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 9, pages 50‚Äì51. But the Gemara asked whether even rural synagogues could be subject to house plagues. For a Baraita taught that the words, \\"in the house of the land of your possession\\" in teach that house plagues would not affect the Israelites until they conquered the Land of Israel. Furthermore, if the Israelites had conquered the Land but not yet divided it among the Tribes, or even divided it among the Tribes but not divided it among the families, or even divided it among the families but not given each person his holding, then house plagues would not yet affect the Israelites. It is to teach this result that says, \\"he who has the house,\\" teaching that house plagues can occur only to those in the Land of Israel to whom alone the house belongs, excluding these houses that do not belong to an owner alone. Thus the Gemara rejected the explanation based on differences between urban and rural synagogues.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 12a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Yoma. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 9, page 52. a (drawing by Pearson Scott Foresman) The Mishnah interpreted the words, \\"there seems to me to be as it were a plague in the house,\\" in to teach that even a learned sage who knows that he has definitely seen a sign of plague in a house may not speak with certainty. Rather, even the sage must say, \\"there seems to me to be as it were a plague in the house.\\"Mishnah Negaim 12:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1005; Sifra Mesora 155:1:9, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 353. The Mishnah interpreted the instruction to empty the house in Rabbi Judah taught that they removed even bundles of wood and even bundles of reeds. Rabbi Simeon remarked that this (removal of bundles that are not susceptible to uncleanness) was idle business. But Rabbi Meir responded by asking which of the homeowner's goods could become unclean. Articles of wood, cloth, or metal surely could be immersed in a ritual bath and become clean. The only thing that the Torah spared was the homeowner's earthenware, even his and his ewer (which, if the house proved unclean, indicates would have to be broken). If the Torah thus spared a person's humble possessions, how much more so would the Torah spare a person's cherished possessions. If the Torah shows so much consideration for material possessions, how much more so would the Torah show for the lives of a person's children. If the Torah shows so much consideration for the possessions of a wicked person (if we take the plague as a punishment for the sin of slander), how much more so would the Torah show for the possessions of a righteous person.Mishnah Negaim 12:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1005. Sifra Mesora 155:1:13, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 354. Reading to say, \\"And he shall look on the plague, and behold the plague,\\" the Sifra interpreted the double allusion to teach that a sign of house plague was no cause of uncleanness unless it appeared in at least the size of two split beans.Sifra Mesora 156:1:1, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 356. And because addresses the house's \\"walls\\" in the plural, the Sifra taught that a sign of house plague was no cause of uncleanness unless it appeared on at least four walls.Sifra Mesora 156:1:2, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 356. Consequently, the Mishnah taught that a round house or a triangular house could not contract uncleanness from a house plague.Mishnah Negaim 12:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1004. See also Sifra Mesora 156:1:2, in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, page 356. \\"Let go the living bird\\" () (illustration circa 1890‚Äì1910 by Paul Hardy) Because addresses the house's \\"stones\\" in the plural, Rabbi Akiva ruled that a sign of house plague was no cause of uncleanness unless it appeared in at least the size of two split beans on two stones, and not on only one stone. And because addresses the house's \\"walls\\" in the plural, Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simeon said that a sign of house plague was no cause of uncleanness unless it appeared in the size of two split beans, on two stones, on two walls in a corner, its length being that of two split beans and its breadth that of one split bean.Mishnah Negaim 12:3, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 1004‚Äì05. Because addresses the \\"stones,\\" \\"timber,\\" and \\"mortar\\" of the house afflicted by a house plague, the Mishnah taught that only a house made of stones, timber, and mortar could be afflicted by a house plague.Mishnah Negaim 12:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1004. And the Mishnah taught that the quantity of wood must be enough to build a threshold, and quantity of mortar must be enough to fill up the space between one row of stones and another.Mishnah Negaim 12:4, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1005. A Baraita taught that there never was a leprous house within the meaning of and never will be. The Gemara asked why then the law was written, and replied that it was so that one may study it and receive reward. But Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Zadok and Rabbi Simeon of Kefar Acco both cited cases where local tradition reported the ruins of such houses, in Gaza and Galilee, respectively.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 71a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Michoel Weiner and Asher Dicker, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1994), volume 48, page 71a. The Chaldees Destroy the Brazen Sea (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) A Midrash read the discussion of the house stricken with plague in as a prophecy. The Midrash read the words, \\"and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession,\\" in to allude to the Temple, about which in God says, \\"I will defile My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your soul.\\" The Midrash read the words, \\"then He whose house it is shall come,\\" in to allude to God, about Whom says, \\"Because of My house that lies waste.\\" The Midrash read the words, \\"and He shall tell the priest,\\" in to allude to Jeremiah, who identified as a priest. The Midrash read the words, \\"there seems to me to be, as it were, a plague in the house,\\" in to allude to the idol that King Manasseh set up in The Midrash read the words, \\"and the priest shall command that they empty the house,\\" in to allude to King Shishak of Egypt, who reports, \\"took away the treasures of the house of the Lord.\\" The Midrash read the words, \\"and he shall break down the house,\\" in to allude to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who reports destroyed the Temple. The Midrash read the words, \\"and they shall pour out the dust that they have scraped off outside the city,\\" in to allude to the Israelites taken away to the Babylonian Captivity, whom reports Nebuchadnezzar \\"carried ... away into Babylon.\\" And the Midrash read the words, \\"and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones,\\" in to allude to the Israelites who would come to restore Israel, and of whom reports God saying, \\"Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation stone, a tried stone, a costly corner-stone of sure foundation; he that believes shall not make haste.\\"Leviticus Rabbah 17:7, in, e.g., Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, translators, Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, volume 4, pages 221‚Äì22. Leviticus chapter 15 Tractate Zavim in the Mishnah and Tosefta interpreted the laws of male genital discharges in Mishnah Zavim 1:1‚Äì5:12, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 1108‚Äì17. Tosefta Zavim 1:1‚Äì5:12, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 1887‚Äì99. Rabbi Akiva (illustration from the 1568 Mantua Haggadah) The Mishnah taught that they inquired along seven lines before they determined that a genital discharge rendered a man unclean. A discharge caused by one of these reasons did not render the man impure or subject him to bringing an offering. They asked: (1) about his food, (2) about his drink, (3) what he had carried, (4) whether he had jumped, (5) whether he had been ill, (6) what he had seen, and (7) whether he had obscene thoughts. It did not matter whether he had had thoughts before or after seeing a woman. Rabbi Judah taught that the discharge would not render him unclean if he had watched animals having intercourse or even if he merely saw a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva taught that the discharge would not render him unclean even if he had eaten any kind of food, good or bad, or had drunk any kind of liquid. The Sages exclaimed to Rabbi Akiva that according to his view, no more men would ever be rendered unclean by genital discharge. Rabbi Akiva replied that one does not have an obligation to ensure that there exist men unclean because of a genital discharges.Mishnah Zavim 2:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1110. Rabbi Eleazar ben Hisma taught that even the apparently arcane laws of bird offerings in and menstrual cycles in and are essential laws.Mishnah Avot 3:18, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 681. Tractate Niddah in the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, and Babylonian Talmud interpreted the laws of menstruation in Mishnah Niddah 1:1‚Äì10:8, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 1077‚Äì95. Tosefta Niddah 1:1‚Äì9:19, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction.

Edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr, Chaim Malinowitz, and Mordechai Marcus, volumes 71‚Äì72. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1996‚Äì2005. Rabbi Meir taught that the Torah ordained that menstruation should separate a wife from her husband for seven days, because if the husband were in constant contact with his wife, the husband might become disenchanted with her. The Torah, therefore, ordained that a wife might be unclean for seven days (and therefore forbidden to her husband for marital relations) so that she should become as desirable to her husband as when she first entered the bridal chamber.Babylonian Talmud Niddah 31b. The Mishnah taught that all women are presumed clean for their husbands (and for the purpose of marital relations, no examination is required). The Mishnah taught that it is also true for men who return from a journey that their wives are presumed clean.Mishnah Niddah 2:4, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

Interpreting the beginning of menstrual cycles, as in the Mishnah ruled that if a woman loses track of her menstrual cycle, there is no return to the beginning of the niddah count in fewer than seven, nor more than seventeen days.Mishnah Arakhin 2:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 811; Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 8a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman, Feivel Wahl, Yosef Davis, Henoch Moshe Levin, Israel Schneider, Yeshayahu Levy, Eliezer Herzka, Dovid Nachfolger, Eliezer Lachman, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 67, page 8a. The Mishnah taught that a woman may attribute a bloodstain to any external cause to which she can possibly attribute it and thus regard herself as clean. If, for instance, she had killed an animal, she was handling bloodstains, she had sat beside those who handled bloodstains, or she had killed a louse, she may attribute the stain to those external causes.Mishnah Niddah 8:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 1089. Babylonian Talmud Niddah 58b. The Mishnah related that a woman once came to Rabbi Akiva and told him that she had observed a bloodstain. He asked her whether she perhaps had a wound. She replied that she had a wound, but it had healed. He asked whether it was possible that it could open again and bleed. She answered in the affirmative, and Rabbi Akiva declared her clean. Observing that his disciples looked at each other in astonishment, he told them that the Sages did not lay down the rule for bloodstains to create a strict result but rather to produce a lenient result, for says, \\"If a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood\\" ‚Äî only blood, not a bloodstain.Mishnah Niddah 8:3, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 1089‚Äì90. Babylonian Talmud Niddah 58b. An ancient mikveh on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem Tractate Mikvaot in the Mishnah and Tosefta interpreted the laws of the ritual bath (, mikveh) prescribed for the cleansing of menstruants in Mishnah Mikvaot 1:1‚Äì10:8, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 1058‚Äì77. Tosefta Mikvaot 1:1‚Äì7:11, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 1809‚Äì35. The Mishnah taught that there are six grades of ritual baths, each higher than the other. The first is rainwater in a water hole. Superior to that is the water of rain drippings that have not stopped. Superior to that is the water of a mikveh containing 40 se'ahs of water, for in such a mikveh persons may immerse themselves and immerse others. Superior to that is the water of a fountain whose own water is little but has been increased by a greater quantity of drawn water. Superior to that are salty or hot waters from a spring, which can render clean when flowing. And superior to that are living waters, which serve for the immersion of persons who have a running issue and for the sprinkling of persons with skin disease, and are valid for the preparation of the water of purification.Mishnah Mikvaot 1:1‚Äì8, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 1058‚Äì60. The Mishnah taught that any pool of water that mingles with the water of a mikveh is as valid as the mikveh itself. The Mishnah taught that one may immerse in holes and crevices of a cavern just as they are, but one may not immerse in the pit of a cavern except if it has an opening as big as the tube of a water skin. Rabbi Judah taught that this is the case when it stands by itself (and forms an independent pool separated by a wall from the pool in the cavern), but if it does not stand by itself, one may immerse in it just as it is (for it is part of the pool in the cavern).Mishnah Mikvaot 6:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation.

In modern interpretation The parashah is discussed in these modern sources: Leviticus chapter 14 Professor Ephraim Speiser of the University of Pennsylvania in the mid 20th century wrote that the word ‚ÄúTorah‚Äù () is based on a verbal stem signifying ‚Äúto teach, guide,‚Äù and the like, and the derived noun can carry a variety of meanings, including in 54, and 57, specific rituals for what is sometimes called leprosy. Speiser argued that in context, the word cannot be mistaken for the title of the Pentateuch as a whole.Ephraim A. Speiser. Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes, volume 1, page xviii. New York: Anchor Bible, 1964. Professor Jacob Milgrom, formerly of the University of California, Berkeley, noted that reddish substances, surrogates for blood, were among the ingredients of the purificatory rites for scale-diseased and corpse-contaminated persons, symbolizing the victory of the forces of life over death.Jacob Milgrom. Leviticus: A Continental Commentary, page 12. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2004. (citing and ). Leviticus chapter 15 Dr. Elaine Goodfriend of California State University, Northridge, argued that the regulations of menstruation in probably had a smaller practical impact on women in ancient Israel than one might imagine, as women at that time probably menstruated less frequently than modem women due to sparser diet, more-frequent pregnancies, and longer breast-feeding (typically three years), all of which would have reduced their number of menstrual cycles.Elaine Goodfriend, \\"Laws about Menstruation (15:19‚Äì24),\\" in Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea L. Weiss, editors, The Torah: A Women's Commentary (New York: URJ Press, 2008), page 668. Professor Shaye Cohen of Harvard University noted that the only element in common between the ‚Äúritual‚Äù or physical impurities of and the ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù or sinful impurities of is intercourse with a menstruant.Shaye J.D.

The laws of a house afflicted with plague in provide an application of the twelfth of the Thirteen Rules for interpreting the Torah in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael that many Jews read as part of the readings before the Pesukei d'Zimrah prayer service. The twelfth rule provides that one may elucidate a matter from its context or from a passage following it. describes the laws of the house afflicted with plague generally. But because instructs what to do with the \\"stones ... timber ... and all the mortar of the house,\\" the Rabbis interpret the laws of the house afflicted with plague to apply only to houses made of stones, timber, and mortar.Menachem Davis.

Haftarah The haftarah for the parashah is The lepers went into a tent (illustration by Charles Joseph Staniland (1838‚Äì1916)) Summary During the Arameans' siege of Samaria, four leprous men at the gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, they went to the Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing from the tents and hid it. The four lepers bring the news to the guards at the gate of Samaria (illumination from Petrus Comestor's 1372 Bible Historiale) Feeling qualms of guilt, they went to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's household within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, they would be able to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the market price of; a measure (seah) of fine flour (about six dry qt., six lb. or three kg.) and two seahs of barley meal; each dropped to one shekel in price, as God's prophet had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said. Connection to the parashah Both the parashah and the haftarah deal with people stricken with skin disease. Both the parashah and the haftarah employ the term for the person affected by skin disease (, metzora). 8. Just before parashah Metzora, in the sister parashah Tazria, provides that the person with skin disease \\"shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be,\\" thus explaining why the four leprous men in the haftarah lived outside the gate. Rabbi Johanan taught that the four leprous men at the gate in were none other than Elisha's former servant Gehazi (whom the Midrash, above, cited as having been stricken with leprosy for profanation of the Divine Name) and his three sons.Babylonian Talmud Sotah 47a, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Sota.

In the parashah, when there \\"seems\\" to be a plague in the house, the priest must not jump to conclusions, but must examine the facts. 39, 44. Just before the opening of the haftarah, in the captain on whom the king leaned jumps to the conclusion that Elisha's prophecy could not come true, and the captain meets his punishment in and 19.See Lainie Blum Cogan and Judy Weiss. Teaching Haftarah: Background, Insights, and Strategies, page 203. Denver: A.R.E. Publishing, 2005. The haftarah in classical rabbinic interpretation Reading \\"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said one to another: 'Why do we sit here until we die? If we say: \\"We will enter into the city,\\" then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us go to the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die,‚Äô\\" and \\"And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there,\\" the Rabbis deduced that when there is a famine a place, one should migrate elsewhere.

They extensively toured the U.S., Europe, Asia and Africa throughout their career together performing a mix of classical and contemporary pieces. Benno Rabinof Benno Rabinof (1902-1975), a violinist, was the last of Leopold Auer's famous students, who also included Efrem Zimbalist, Mischa Elman, and Jascha Heifetz. In 1927, Benno made his Carnegie Hall debut playing the Elgar and Tchaikovsky concertos, with Auer conducting. Benno then performed throughout America and Europe, in solo recitals and with orchestras. In the late thirties and early forties, Benno played 28 different concertos in a series of 28 weekly WOR broadcasts under the baton of Alfred Wallenstein. Sylvia Rabinof Sylvia Rabinof, a pianist, teacher, and composer, was born Sylvia Smith in New York on October 10, 1913. As a child and teenager, Sylvia attended the Third Street Music School Settlement, later continuing her piano studies with Paderewski, Simon Barere, and Rudolf Serkin. Sylvia made her European debut in Paris in 1937; and in 1938, she gave a recital at Town Hall in New York. Sylvia died in Florida on January 20, 2001. Rabinof collaborations and life after Benno A week after Sylvia and Benno met, they got together for their first date, spending the day playing all 10 of Beethoven‚Äôs sonatas for violin and piano. Benno and Sylvia married in 1943 and began concertizing around the world together, performing violin and piano sonatas, as well as appearing in solo recitals and as soloists with major orchestras. For their tenth wedding anniversary in 1953, Sylvia and Benno performed all 10 Beethoven piano and violin sonatas in one day at Town Hall, a feat they would repeat at Alice Tully Hall in 1969. In 1954, they premiered the Concerto for Violin, Piano and Orchestra of the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu, which was commissioned by them. Sylvia and Benno continued to perform together until Benno died in 1975. Throughout their career Benno and Sylvia maintained a busy performing and teaching schedule, and chose to emphasize that over preparing for recordings. However, in 1965 Decca records produced \\"Gypsy Violin Classics,\\" featuring Benno on the violin and Sylvia on piano. In May 1965, a High Fidelity reviewer wrote, ‚ÄúRabinof‚Äôs pulsating, glossy tone and his spectacular velocity definitely bear the Auer label, long a distinguishing trademark in the annals of violin playing. He gives an impressive and satisfying account of himself in this collection.‚Äù Sylvia Rabinof also taught and composed, specializing in composing improvisations based on the classics. From 1971 to 1979, she taught in the pre-college division at Juilliard, and she gave summer workshops at the Brevard Music Center in North Carolina. For some 30 years, Sylvia wrote biographies of musicians and articles about improvisation for Junior Keynotes magazine, a publication of the National Federation of Music Clubs. Sylvia also served as chairperson of the federation‚Äôs improvisation activities and regularly performed and gave workshops at the federation‚Äôs annual convention. In 1978, Sylvia married Charles Rothenberg, a lawyer and music lover. In 1989, Sylvia and Charles, who by then were spending their winters in Florida, moved permanently from New York to Florida. Charles died in 1992. Sylvia continued to play the piano, compose, and teach, using the name Sylvia Rabinof, until her death at age 87 on January 20, 2001. During the 1990s, Sylvia performed as a solo pianist and with other musicians, including violinist Ruggiero Ricci. In the mid 1990s, a CD featuring Ricci and Sylvia in a performance of the Sibelius Violin and Piano Sonata was produced. In 2003, Pavilion Records, LTD, under the Pearl label, produced a CD made from tapes of performances by the Rabinofs in the 1940s and 1950s. Sylvia's students included Ken Noda, Richard Allston, and Jose Ramos-Santana; and she mentored Richard Glazier, composing a variation on a theme by Gershwin for Glazier to perform.

Storylines When Annie arrived in Albert Square in 1997, she is believed to be a former business associate of George Palmer (Paul Moriarty). Together they open a print shop called \\"By The Letter\\" to cover their illegal deals, but Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) catches them hugging. Grant's mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) is dating George, so Grant tells her what he has seen; when Peggy confronts George, he tells her that Annie is his daughter. Annie takes over George's nightclub, The Cobra Club, renames it The Market Cellar, and uses it to facilitate her money-laundering operations and illegal gambling). Like her father, Annie is well-connected in the business world; the Palmer name also carries serious clout in the underworld. Annie soon builds herself a small business empire in Albert Square. She gets most of the local council on side and she is instrumental in helping Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) run for a council seat. She owns a significant share of the Walford Health Club with Grant, and starts a loan-shark business with his brother Phil (Steve McFadden), not to mention her continuous dealing in money-laundering scams. Annie is shrewd and smart and completely averse to showing any emotion, which comes from a desperate need to prove that she can cut it in a male-dominated business. She wants to show her father that she can do her job as good as, if not better than, any man. But Annie's tough exterior masks a hidden vulnerability, so she rarely allows men to get close to her. She has flings with Conor Flaherty (Se√°n Gleeson) (her loan-shark 'heavy') and Phil at the same time, and relishes watching them compete against each other for her affections. She later becomes close to her childhood friend Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman), but when they look likely to embark on a serious relationship, Annie's father drops the bombshell that Gianni may be his son. It is revealed that George had had an affair with Gianni's mother Rosa (Louise Jameson) behind Rosa's husband's back, and Gianni's paternity is unknown. The realisation that he could have been having an incestuous relationship with Annie devastates Gianni, and he cuts all ties with both George and Annie. Blood tests later confirm that George isn't Gianni's father, which devastates him as he has always longed for a son who would inherit the family business. Seeing her father's devastation, Annie shows some rare emotion and tells him she'd always sensed his desperation for a son and that is why she'd always strived so hard to prove her worth. Unable to deal with Annie's emotion, George leaves England in 1998, leaving Annie to run their businesses on her own. Annie later becomes involved with fellow businessman Steve Owen (Martin Kemp); the two are locked in a cat-and-mouse game of one-upmanship with each other. He manages to get through her prickly defences, and even manages to buy her nightclub, which he renames The E20. Annie's loan-shark business hits a setback in 1999, when she dabbles on the turf of a rival business gang. Refusing to cede after receiving threats, she is beaten nearly to death by the gang's heavies. Although she shows a brave front, her confidence is severely undermined and she turns to Steve for support and comfort, but he rejects her, leaving her humiliated. To get back at him, she sells her health-club shares to Grant instead of him, but it is a hollow victory and in June 1999 she leaves Walford. She lives with her father in New Zealand, where his import/export business is based. Casting and departure Sawalha spoke in an interview with Larry Jaffee about how she got the role of Annie saying that she auditioned with many other actresses. She got through to the screen test with Victoria Gould who played Polly Becker. Sawalha has said that the only two they screen-tested were her and Victoria Gould: \\"We were always going to get the job. They hadn‚Äôt decided which way they were going to go (who was going to be Annie and who Polly). They always have a vague idea of they want, and then they build the character around the person they choose. I was pleased when they turned it around.\\" She also said she enjoyed playing \\"such a devilsome lady\\". Sawalha originally believed she may not be right for EastEnders saying,‚ÄúMy father is Arabic and my mother English. I just thought that I was too exotic ‚Äî that there wasn‚Äôt enough call for a foreigner.‚Äù In September 1998 it was revealed that Sawalha had quit the role. Reception Author Kate Lock described her as \\"a rather terrifying creation, a kind of dominatrix without the dungeon. A verbal Miss Whiplash, she tore strips off anyone who crosses her.\\" The BBC described her as a 'tough-nut business woman'. She was also described as 'tough' and 'steel'. She was voted by What's on TV as the 85 sexiest soap sirens of all time out of 100. When Nadia announced her decision to leave it was described by The Mirror 'as a real shock' and that 'Her character, scheming Annie Palmer, has proved one of the most watchable in recent years.'

Princess finalized the order for the ship in 1998 in response to the strong demand for her sister ship, Grand Princess, making her the fleet's second Grand-class ship. She was built by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri in Monfalcone, delivered in 2001, and christened by Merlisa George in Saint Thomas in April 2002. While operating as Golden Princess, she has sailed to all seven continents, beginning with her debut in Southampton in May 2001, followed by seasonal deployments serving regions around the Caribbean and Europe. In 2007, she circumnavigated South America and debuted along the West Coast of the United States before also sailing around ports in Asia and Oceania bordering the Pacific Ocean until 2020. In 2017, Carnival Corporation announced Golden Princess would be transferred from Princess to sister brand P&O; Cruises Australia as a part of P&O;'s fleet renewal. She was originally expected to debut as Pacific Adventure in October 2020, sailing itineraries around Oceania, but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, her debut is subject to P&O;'s resumption of operations.  Construction and career   Golden Princess   1998‚Äì2002: Construction and debut  In January 1998, in a response to strong forward bookings for Grand Princess, Princess announced it was ordering two additional Grand-class ships at a cost of approximately US$425 million each from Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri for delivery in 2001. The order came amid a large fleet expansion that was originally commissioned by Princess after seeing a favorable response to the new Grand-class concept of cruising first introduced on Sun Princess in 1995, which includes more staterooms with private balconies and also provides guests with a larger variety of onboard dining, entertainment, and recreation choices. The first ship, named Golden Princess, was floated out on 31 August 2000 in Monfalcone. She officially debuted in Southampton in May 2001 and sailed her maiden voyage on May 16, 2001. For her inaugural summer, she sailed 12-day Mediterranean voyages between Barcelona and Istanbul, with Caribbean voyages from Fort Lauderdale, Florida beginning on 13 October 2001. She was originally planned to be christened by Jane Seymour on 12 October 2001, but was later christened by Merlisa George, Miss US Virgin Islands 2002, on 17 April 2002 in Saint Thomas.  2002‚Äì2006: Caribbean and Europe service  Golden Princess returned to the Mediterranean in the summer of 2002, but in the wake of the September 11 attacks, Princess modified the ship's itineraries, replacing all ports in Turkey with ports in Italy, Malta, and Monaco. That fall, she sailed her first season in New England and the Maritimes. She was deployed to Europe for her third consecutive summer in 2003, cruising between Barcelona and Venice. In 2004, Princess homeported Golden Princess in San Juan, Puerto Rico year-round for weekly Southern Caribbean cruises. In 2005, Princess deployed the ship to Southampton for the summer to sail Northern Europe cruises and repeated the rotation in 2006 with the additions of Eastern Mediterranean cruises to Greece and Egypt. In December 2006, Princess deployed Golden Princess to sail out of New Orleans for the company's first time operating from the port, selling three cruises to the Western Caribbean. This would mark the ship's last deployment in the Caribbean.  2007‚Äì2020: Pacific service  In the winter of 2006-2007, Golden Princess sailed to South America and around Cape Horn for the first time as a part of her move to the Western United States for her debut in Alaska from Seattle. Following her Alaskan season, she debuted in Los Angeles for weekly Mexican Riviera sailings. In the fall of 2008, the ship began sailing round-trip 14-day Hawaii itineraries from Los Angeles, continuing this rotation for the next few years. Aerial view of Golden Princess in Juneau, Alaska, 2011 In the fall of 2013, Golden Princess performed the company's first season of 3-/4-day cruises from the West Coast, before returning to South America later in the winter. The rotation repeated the following year. In the summer of 2015, Golden Princess cruised Alaska sailings from San Francisco for the first time. Following this, she crossed the Pacific Ocean and debuted in Melbourne for her maiden Australia season in fall 2015, making her the largest ship to homeport there. She then debuted in China, sailing from Tianjin, the following summer, before returning to Melbourne in fall 2016. The ship did not homeport in North America for 2017, a first in her history, and left for a 75-day circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean from Sydney in May of that year, before returning to Melbourne in fall 2017. In the summer of 2018, Golden Princess sailed another Alaska season from Los Angeles as well as between Vancouver and Whittier, Alaska and returned to Melbourne in fall 2018. The 2019-2020 season marked the last active season that the ship sailed as Golden Princess. She began with weekly Alaska voyages in summer 2019 before returning to Melbourne in fall 2019. In March 2020, during a round-trip sailing from Melbourne to New Zealand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, three passengers were quarantined onboard after one was suspected of having the coronavirus when they began developing symptoms. At the time of the announcement, the ship was bound for Akaroa and proceeded to anchor in Akaroa Harbour to allow for medical officials to test the guests, who ultimately tested negative. The remainder of the voyage was subsequently cancelled and the ship was cleared to return to Melbourne, following the Australian government's ordinance for all cruise ships to return to their homeports. The ship returned on 19 March 2020 and all guests were tested and subsequently cleared to disembark after none of the tests returned positive. Golden Princess was scheduled to perform a full season of Alaska voyages from Los Angeles in summer 2020 and a final transpacific crossing to Singapore in fall 2020, but due to the pandemic, all sailings of the ship since the cruise line's suspension of operations have been cancelled.  Pacific Adventure   Background  In December 2015, Carnival Corporation announced it had ordered a new 4,200-passenger ship from Fincantieri for Princess' sister brand, P&O; Cruises Australia, as a part of its \\"fleet enhancement plan.\\" The new ship, scheduled for delivery in 2019, would become P&O;'s first-ever new- build vessel and its largest ship overall in the fleet. However, in December 2016, the order for the new ship was transferred to sister brand Carnival Cruise Line (CCL) in exchange for Carnival Splendor joining the P&O; fleet instead. In a statement, P&O; president Sture Myrmell conceded that the market's current infrastructure and its anticipated pace of development would be inadequate to support the brand's earlier, more ambitious expansion goals. But in September 2017, Carnival issued a further fleet realignment, announcing Golden Princess would transfer to P&O;, with Carnival Splendor continuing to operate for CCL. In September 2018, after hosting an online naming contest, P&O; announced Golden Princess would be renamed Pacific Adventure and debut in October 2020, featuring modified accommodations and onboard facilities designed in-line with the P&O; brand.  Service  In October 2018, P&O; unveiled the inaugural schedule for Pacific Adventure, with cruises of various lengths from Australian ports, visiting New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and other destinations in Oceania, beginning in October 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led P&O; to halt its operations, affecting the ship's debut; as of August 2020, it is scheduled to suspend all cruises until 2 December 2020. Design and specifications Princess made several changes to the design of Golden Princess compared with Grand Princess, including a modified stern (left) and a new internet caf√© (right).Princess commissioned Golden Princess to have similar dimensions to Grand Princess: they both measure and have an approximate capacity of 2,600 passengers. Additionally, they have a length of , a draft of , and a beam of . Golden Princess is powered by a diesel-electric genset system, with six Sulzer engines: four producing and two producing . Main propulsion is via two diesel-electric propellers. The system gives the vessel a maximum speed of . The ship houses 1,299 passenger cabins and 627 crew cabins. Of the 1,299 passenger cabins, 72% have a view outside, including 55% that include a balcony. She has a maximum capacity of 4,160 passengers and crew. Onboard, Golden Princess retains much of the design of Grand Princess, aside from several changes. Instead of the slanted bulkheads of the tiered decks below her sister ship's navigation bridge, she has flat bulkheads. Additionally, in order to reduce the ship's weight, she features a modified stern made of lighter materials, particularly in the \\"handle,\\" which housed the ship's nightclub. Inside, the ship also houses a large variety of lounge spaces, including three performance venues and nine bars and lounges. Princess also debuted several new internet-based features aboard Golden Princess, including the fleet's first internet caf√©, designed and furnished in partnership with AOL, a digital photo center, and a real-time wedding camera. After Golden Princess transitions into P&O;'s fleet, her guest capacity will be increased to 3,100, with modifications including the addition of five-berth cabins. P&O; also invited the public to contribute suggestions in order to design a more family-oriented experience on the ship. Other new features will consist of a new adults-only lounge space and a recreational park.

The towers named Phasael, Hippicus and Mariamne were situated in the northwest corner of the so-called First Wall, the Hasmonean and Herodian city wall protecting the Western Hill of Jerusalem. They were situated close to where the Jaffa Gate is today and were built by Herod the Great at the same time he built his immediately adjacent royal palace. These towers protected the main entrance to the city, as well as the palace, constituting a potential last refuge for the king. All three towers have vanished except for the base of the Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower, upon which the present \\"Tower of David\\" rests. The towers were named by Herod after his brother Phasael, his friend and general Hippicus who had fallen in battle, and his favourite wife, Mariamne. When the city was razed in 70 AD, all three towers were left standing, in order to show off the strength of the fortifications the Roman army had to overcome.Josephus, The Jewish War, 7.1.1. With time though, only one of Herod's towers survived - either Phasael, or according to some, including archaeologist Hillel Geva who excavated the Citadel, Hippicus. However, during the Byzantine period, the remaining tower, and by extension the Citadel as a whole, acquired its alternative name - the Tower of David - after the Byzantines, mistakenly identifying the hill as Mount Zion, presumed it to be David's palace mentioned in . The Citadel was gradually built up under Muslim and Crusader rule and acquired the basis of its present shape in 1310, under the Mamluk sultan Malik al-Nasir. Suleiman the Magnificent later constructed the monumental gateway in the east that you enter through today. The minaret (no public access), a prominent Jerusalem landmark, was added between 1635 and 1655, and took over the title of \\"Tower of David\\" in the nineteenth century, so that the name can now refer to either the whole Citadel or the minaret alone. On the site itself, from the top of the Hippicus (or Phasael) Tower, there are good views over the excavations inside the Citadel and out to the Old City, as well as into the distance south and west. Of the original tower itself, some sixteen courses of the original stone ashlars can still be seen rising from ground level, upon which were added smaller stones in a later period, which added significantly to its height. On the way up, a terrace overlooking the diggings has plaques identifying the different periods of all the remains. These include part of the Hasmonean city wall, a Roman cistern, and the ramparts of the Umayyad citadel, which held out for five weeks before falling to the Crusaders in 1099.

Built in 1962 and operated by the City of Chesapeake, it carried U.S. Route 17 (US 17) which is Dominion Boulevard (formerly numbered as State Route 104). The corridor frequently acts as a bypass route for congested I-64 High Rise Bridge traffic. Because of the low water clearance, bridge openings were commonplace for the bridge, with an average of 16 lifts per day. Combined with an average daily traffic count of 33,000, it frequently became a choke point for commuters who lived in the Deep Creek part of the city, with a failing level of service on the entire stretch according to a during a 2006 traffic plan by the HRPTO.http://www.hrtpo.org/uploads/docs/2026RTPtechdoc.pdf In January 2013, Chesapeake Public Works began construction on a $345 million fixed-bridge replacement project called the Veterans Bridge, which was completed in late 2017. It expanded Dominion Blvd. from two to four lanes from the intersection of Cedar Road & Moses Grady Trail to the interchange of Great Bridge Blvd.. The Veterans Bridge is tolled, which started at the rate of $1 in 2017. This project is also a part of the planning for the future Interstate 87 that will connect the Raleigh-Durham Metro area to the Hampton Roads region. After the first span of the Veterans Bridge opened in December 2014, the Steel Bridge was shut down and demolished.

They first appeared in \\"The Mystery of the Tiny Supermen!\\" in Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #48 (October 1960). They were created by writer Otto Binder and artist Curt Swan. The squad is a group of volunteers from the bottled city of Kandor, a city from Superman's home planet of Krypton that was shrunk by Brainiac and is kept in a glass jar in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Outside the bottle, the tiny Kandorians have similar powers to Superman, and when they determine that Superman is in trouble, they can leave the bottle and fly to his assistance. The swarm of Superman-lookalikes uses a special scientific process to enlarge themselves to the size of dolls before heading into the field. Fictional background Pre-Crisis Prior to the Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot, the Superman Emergency Squad is a group of miniaturized Kryptonians from the bottle city of Kandor, which is housed in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. The Squad provides assistance to Superman when he is incapacitated or otherwise occupied. Members of the squad include Superman's look alike cousin Van- ZeeSuperman #148 (October 1961) (who also uses the secret identity Nightwing), and Don-El, the captain of the Squad.Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #60 (April 1962) In the early appearances of the Squad, the members were specially selected due to their close resemblance to Superman;Action Comics #276 (May 1961) later stories dropped this concept.Superman #167 (February 1964) Their costumes were originally modeled on that of Superman but with the 'S' in an elongated triangle. The Squad goes into action whenever they receive a signal from Superman, or see that he is in trouble while monitoring him. To leave the shrunken city of Kandor, the Squad uses a small rocket ship to fly up to the cork that seals the mouth of the bottle. They then expose themselves to a enlarging gas that causes them to grow from their regular microscopic size to several inches in height. This gives them the ability to force the cork out of the mouth, allowing them access to the outside worldAction Comics # 276 (May 1961) (in later stories, the Squad installs a door in the cork, to facilitate exits and entrances).Superman #179 (August 1965) Once outside the bottle city the Squad members, like all natives of Krypton, gain the same powers and abilities as Superman. Post-Crisis A new version of the Squad appeared the Crisis reboot, now renamed Kandorian Emergency Squad. Instead of providing emergency assistance to Superman, it now acts as a policing unit in Kandor. The Squad is led by Cerizah, sister of Superman's ally Ceritak. In Superman: The Man of Steel #100 (May 2000), the Emergency Squad leaves Kandor to help Superman defeat Hank Henshaw. As time passes at a faster rate in Kandor, the current status of the squad is uncertain.

(9 June 1729, in Northampton, England ‚Äì 6 February 1796, in Minories) was a scholarly English dissenting clergyman and teacher. Life He was born at Northampton, June 9, 1729, and was educated under Dr. Philip Doddridge, whose manner in the pulpit he closely followed for many years. After being admitted to preach, he removed in 1750, to Spaldwick in Huntingdonshire; where, in 1752, he married Miss Reymes of Norwich, a lady who died in 1811, at an advanced age. A few weeks after his marriage, he was called to be minister of a congregation of dissenters at Market Harborough, Leicestershire. His receiving this appointment was owing to a singular occurrence in the history of popular elections. Two candidates had appeared who divided the congregation so equally that a compromise was impossible, unless by each party giving up their favourite, and electing a third candidate, if one could be found agreeable to all. At this crisis Mr. Addington was recommended, and unanimously chosen. In this place he remained about thirty years, and became highly popular to his increasing congregation by the pious discharge of his pastoral duties, and by his conciliatory manners. In 1758 he opened his house for the reception of pupils to fill up a vacancy in the neighbourhood of Harborough, occasioned by John Aikin's move to Warrington Academy. This scheme succeeded; and for many years he devoted nine hours each day to the instruction of his pupils, and compiled books for their improvement. At length, in 1781 he received an invitation to become pastor of the congregation in Miles's-lane, Cannon Street; and soon after his removal there was chosen tutor of a new dissenting academy at Mile End, where he resided until his growing infirmities, occasioned by several paralytic strokes, obliged him to relinquish the charge. He continued, however, in the care of his congregation till within a few months of his decease, when, from the same cause, he was compelled to discontinue his public services. He died Feb. 6, 1796, at his house in the Minories. In London he was neither so successful or popular as in the country; and his quitting Harborough after so long a residence appears to have displeased his friends, without adding to his usefulness among his new connections. Works His textbooks and other writings include the following. *A system of Arithmetic, 2 vols. 8vo. *The Rudiments of the Greek tongue, 1761, 12mo. *Eusebes to Philetus; or Letters from a Father to his Son, on a devout temper and life, 1761, 12mo. *Maxims religious and prudential, with a Sermon to young People, 12mo. *The Youth's Geographical Grammar, 1770, 8vo. *Dissertation on the religious knowledge of the ancient Jews and Patriarchs; to which is annexed a specimen of a Greek and English Concordance, 1757, 4to; which he had a design of completing, if his health and time had permitted. He published also, partly in the country, and partly in London, some occasional funeral and other sermons; two tracts on infant baptism; a collection of psalm tunes, and another of anthems; and his most popular work, The Life of St. Paul the Apostle, 1784, 8vo.

The Voice of the Guns (1917) is a British military march composed by Kenneth Alford during World War I. It was written as a tribute to British artillerymen serving in the war, hence its name, though later became widely adopted by the entire British army. The piece is generally arranged for a full marching band or orchestra, though piano and organ versions have also been composed. Maurice Jarre's score used an arrangement for piccolos (in lieu of fifes) with drums within his overture for \\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\", and he also rearranged the piece for a military band, assembled from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, which segues in an out of fragmentary motifs from the 'Lawrence' theme, later during the film. It is to be remarked that Jarre's arrangement of the march is quite different from the original, and it does not utilize the original 6-bar introduction. The song starts out with three brief musical phrases, followed by a segue into the main triumphant, fast-moving marching theme which remains throughout the rest of the piece. The full version of the piece generally lasts about three minutes, though longer and shorter arrangements have also been made. An arrangement of it was famously used in David Lean's film Lawrence of Arabia (1962), to represent British Empire military power. Its most notable use in the film occurs during the scene when Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) and General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) discuss strategy while descending the stairs of the British army headquarters in Cairo. Today the piece remains a popular selection for marching bands and orchestras. In 1983 the quick march of the Royal Artillery, \\"British Grenadiers\\" (in use by the regiment since 1762) was extended, by Lt. Col. Stanley Patch, to include the Trio section from \\"The Voice Of The Guns\\", in honour of the Royal Artillery's Captain General, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The tune British Grenadiers used by the Royal Artillery bands differs from that of the Grenadier Guards only by having different horn parts; other than that they are identical. Its association with the Royal Artillery predates the formation of the Grenadier Guards Regiment, and the Royal Artillery were the first British regiment to use the French grenate, or grenade. The Royal Artillery were also the first British regiment to adopt the grenade as a badge symbol.

In Paenitemini Paul changed the strictly regulated Catholic fasting requirements. He recommended that fasting be appropriate to the local economic situation, and that all Catholics voluntarily fast and abstain. He further recommended that fasting and abstinence be replaced with prayer and works of charity \\"in countries where the standard of living is lower\\". Content Pope Paul noted the Church's mission of showing man the right way to use earthly goods and to collaborate in the \\"consecration of the world.\\" All members of the Church are called upon to participate in the work of Christ and therefore to participate also in His expiation. While he emphasized the great importance of penance as \\"a religious, personal act which has as its aim love and surrender to God\\", he observed that the Church, attentive to the signs of the times is prompted to seek, beyond fast and abstinence, new expressions more suitable for the realization of the precise goal of penitence.Pope Paul VI, \\"Paenitemini: Apostolic Constitution on Fast and Abstinence\\", Vatican, February 17, 1966 > \\"[T]he necessity of an asceticism which chastises the body and brings it > into subjection is affirmed with special insistence by the example of Christ > Himself. ...The intimate relationship which exists in penitence between the > external act, inner conversion, prayer and works of charity is affirmed and > widely developed in the liturgical texts and authors of every era. The purpose of the new canonical laws was not to weaken the practice of penance but to make it more effective. Paul stated that while preserving the custom (observed for many centuries with canonical norms) of practicing penitence also through abstinence from meat and fasting, the Church intends to ratify other forms of penitence as well, and left it to the episcopal conferences to replace the observance of fast and abstinence with exercises of prayer and works of charity where appropriate.

It is the prequel and fourth book of the Silverwing series, and takes place 65 million years before the events of the first book. It describes the origins of the war between the birds and the beasts. Setting Set 65 million years ago, at the very beginning of the Paleocene epoch, a huge natural disaster has wiped out most of the dinosaurs (referred to as \\"Saurians\\" within the context of the story). A few managed to survive in the aftermath, albeit weakened by climate change, a shortage of food, and a flesh-rotting virus. The mammals, who were once at the Saurians' mercy, decided to form The Pact: unable to wage battle against them on their own terms, they decided to band together to exterminate the remaining Saurians by destroying their eggs. Plot summary Dusk, a young Chiropter, is being taught by his father to glide. Dusk is different from the other Chiropters, however; whereas his brethren have simple sails, Dusk has wings, and an urge to fly that he has difficulty suppressing. He is regarded as a freak by the other Chiropters, though he finds acceptance with his parents and his sister, Sylph. Dusk learns to fly, but keeps his secret to himself out of fear of being shunned. Carnassial, the Felid (a type of proto-cat) also has a hidden desire. Born with shearing teeth and an insatiable appetite for flesh, he seemingly fulfils the pact when he destroys the last known batch of Saurian eggs. He leads a pack consisting of other flesh-craving Felids to form a new world order. The rogue pack of Felids find their way to Dusk's island and devour many of his colony, among them Dusk's mother. With their island invaded by the deadly new predators, it is up to Dusk and his unique powers of flight and echolocation to find the Chiropters a new home. Carnassial strikes an alliance with the powerful (but unintelligent) Hyaenodons, who claim that the Saurians do still exist, and enlist the Felids to find and destroy their eggs. Carnassial comes to realise that in order for the Felids to rule, it will have to be through cunning rather than through power. Along the way, Dusk and his colony seek refuge with a seemingly peaceful colony of \\"Tree Runners\\", only to find out that they plan on sacrificing them to a giant, meat-eating bird; the Diatryma. After escaping, Dusk finds a new home for his fellow Chiropters, but it is on the other side of a savannah, which is home to many predators. While Dusk is scouting for a good place, he meets another creature that looks similar to himself; it calls itself a bat and tells Dusk that there are many others like them. The Soricids overwhelm and devour a Hyaenodon, and nearly kill Dusk, but he is rescued by Sylph. He and Sylph are attacked by Carnassial and his Hyaenodons once again, and take refuge in the skeleton of a large dinosaur. Through it, they find their way into an eerie cave, where Dusk and Sylph discover a nest of an unidentified meat-eating Saurian, along with a clutch of mostly unhatched eggs and the rotting carcasses of the parents. The Felids return and Carnassial's mate is attacked by a young dinosaur, the sibling of the eggs who'd hatched early. Carnassial fights to save his mate, but both are killed in the confrontation. The saurian chases Dusk out of the cave and attacks the Hyaenodon as the heroes flee. Eventually, Dusk leads the Chiropters to their new home, and the book ends with him leaving the colony and promising his sister to return if he dislikes life with bats. Characters Chiropters *Dusk - Dusk is a young Chiropter who is considered a freak among his colony because of his ability to fly and his strange appearance. Dusk is clever and resourceful and tries his hardest to fit in with the colony. He looks up to his father, Icaron. *Sylph - Sylph is Dusk's extremely reckless twin sister, older by three seconds. She is loud, amazingly loyal and generally unaware of any possible repercussions of her actions. She does not always understand the reasoning behind her father's actions, leading to frequent arguments. *Jib - Jib is a young newborn Chiropter. He likes to show off and dislikes Dusk because of his appearance and his ability to fly. He bullies Dusk by saying that if he wasn't the leader's son, he would have been taken down to the Death Branch and abandoned there after his birth. *Aeolus - [Deceased] Aeolus is Jib's cousin, and is usually in the company of both Jib and Sylph. He was attacked and killed by birds who believed that he was Dusk, and was left to the elements on the Death Branch. *Icaron - [Deceased] Icaron is the leader of the colony and the elder of his family. His mate is Mistral and they have had many offspring, including Auster, their oldest, and Dusk and Sylph, their youngest. Icaron is kind and strong, reacting calmly in situations of panic. Icaron is accepting and is one of the only Chiropters in the colony to accept Dusk for who he is. His decisions are frequently challenged by Nova. Carnassial attacked him and gave him the wounds that brought him to his death. *Mistral - [Deceased] Mistral is the mate of Icaron and the mother of Auster, Dusk, Sylph, and many others. A skillful hunter, it appears that Dusk inherited her echovision-like abilities from her, which Icaron had been aware of but had cautioned Mistral not to reveal so she would not be shunned by the colony. *Auster - Auster is the eldest son of Icaron and Mistral and is one of the few to accept Dusk's unusual appearance. He has a family of his own and therefore does not interact with Dusk and Sylph's lives often until the Felids invade their island; nonetheless he still shows concern for them when their mother died during their escape. When their father died, Auster did not hesitate to raise them into his family. Near the end of the book, he becomes the leader of the Chiropters. *Nova - Nova is the elder of her family. She is reckless and stubborn, and often challenges Icaron's decisions and capability to lead the colony. She took advantage of when Dusk was away finding a new home to take more than half the colony back along the coast to find a home with other chiropters. *Sol - [Deceased] Sol is the elder of his family. He was very loyal to his leader, Icaron. While trying to protect his family, the poisonous Soricids (a prehistoric mammal similar to a shrew) paralyzed him, leading to his being killed and eaten by the little predators. *Barat - Barat is the elder of his family. He is generally level-headed, but sometimes is a little rash in his decisions. He follows Nova when she decides to abandon Dusk. *Gyrokus - Leader of a different chiropter group. He helps Icaron and his group after they escape from their island, but then banishes them from his group because of former acts of Icaron. *Chimera - A female Chiropter with an appearance similar to Dusk's. Dusk meets her while searching for a new home for his colony and is astonished to find another Chiropter who is unlike the rest. She calls herself a bat, after the leader of her colony and supposedly the first Chiropter to evolve to have flight capabilities, Bat-ra. Chimera appears to be interested in Dusk and persuades him to join her colony, and at the end of the book he leaves Sylph and his own colony, promising to return in the future. Felids *Carnassial - Carnassial is a felid and a ferocious hunter. He destroyed what was believed to have been the last of the saurians, but his taste for meat encouraged him to eat the flesh of other species. This eventually led to his expulsion from his tribe (\\"prowl\\"). Near the end he is seen trying to rescue his mate from the jaws of a young Saurian. *Panthera - [deceased] Panthers is Carnassial's hunting partner and mate. After she discovers a kill made by Carnassial she keeps his secret, although he is found out anyway. Eventually she also discovers a taste for meat, and she joins Carnassial. She reveals to him in the Saurian cave that she is pregnant with his kittens. She is attacked by a proto-owl soon after departing from the main prowl but is saved by Carnassial. At the end she is pried from Carnassial by a young Saurian. *Patriofelis - [deceased] Patriofelis is the felid leader and very old. He banishes Carnassial from his prowl and is later carried off by a proto-owl while confronting Carnassial's rogue prowl. *Miacis - [deceased] Miacis is another strong felid who brought a group of felids to Carnassial and told him they too, craved meat as he did. would've been Carnassial's mate if she wasn't dead and if Panthera stayed with Patriofelis Others *Teryx - A bird that Dusk meets on the island. They develop an uneasy relationship founded mostly from curiosity toward one another. He warns Dusk of Carnassial's barbaric prowl in spite of how the other birds hate Dusk for his ability to fly. *Danian - Leader of a hyaenodons. He is a strong leader and cares for his pact. He forms an alliance with Carnassial's prowl to team up against the saurians. *Adapis - Leader of a clan of tree runners. He is a clever tree runner, but also very selfish and underhanded. He has an unsteady alliance with a diatryma that is wounded on one of its legs so it cannot successfully chase down prey. She must have Adapis bring her food or she will starve, in return she protects Adapis's clan from any danger. Adapis tries feeding Icaron's group to the diatryma but fails because of Dusk's brave actions that save many of the Chiropters. The enraged diatryma still demands a feast, and it is implied that tree runners - possibly including Adapis himself - would be offered in compensation. Species In Darkwing, animal species are often referred by their taxonomic clade name rather than their own, which makes it difficult to know exactly what species each creature is. Where the species name is not known, they are listed under the name that they had in the book. The creatures are listed in the order of their appearance. The chiropters are fictional; a hypothetical species intended to represent a primitive bat. *Chiropter *Prehistoric Birds *Quetzalcoatlus (referred to as \\"Quetzals\\") *Miacis (referred to as \\"Felids\\") *Paramys *Prehistoric Owls *Alphadon *Prehistoric Primates (referred to as \\"Tree-runners\\") *Gastornis (referred to as \\"Diatryma\\") *Crocodiles (referred to as \\"Swamp Saurians\\") *Phenacodus (referred to as \\"Equids\\") *Hyaenodon *Bisonalveus browni (referred to as \\"Soricid\\") *Giant Spiders *Theropod dinosaur (referred to as \\"Saurian\\") Publication history Darkwing was first released in Canada and the United States in August 2007.

It took place near the village of Roslin, where a force led by the Scots John Comyn and Sir Simon Fraser ambushed and defeated an English reconnaissance party under Lord John Segrave. Background An Anglo-Scottish truce expired on 30 November 1302, and the English prepared for a fresh invasion of Scotland, with John Segrave as the king's lieutenant in Scotland. King Edward I ordered Segrave to carry out a large-scale reconnaissance as far as Kirkintilloch, before the king himself fought a larger campaign. This force assembled at Wark on Tweed and moved north.Traquair pp. 110-111 The battle The English advanced in three divisions, harassed by the Scots. At night, they camped in three divisions, several miles apart. The two commanders, John Comyn and Simon Fraser, led a Scots force on a night march, fell on the English, capturing Segrave and several others. Robert Neville led his division towards the action. The English eventually freed Segrave, but the English paymaster Manton was killed.Traquair p. 111 Later legend Scottish historian John of Fordun wrote an exaggerated description of the fight: The battle was the subject of a fictional account written by Walter Bower in the mid-15th century. Like Fordun, Bower seriously exaggerated its size and importance. The distorted impression of Roslin has lingered in the public imagination to this day. A monument cairn erected by the Roslin Heritage Society at the end of the 20th century marks the site of the battle. At the start of the 21st century, the battlefield was under research to be inventoried and protected by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.

The song, which features R&B; singer Pogo, deals overtly with police brutality and racism. In the song, he narrates how the black community in the United States face harassment by racists, including police. Overview In the intro, Tupac receives phone calls from one of his friends about the police beating them for no apparent reason and various crimes that are directed at them, after which he starts to rap. The theme of the song is strongly anti-racist and anti-police, and the lyrics tell about racism, such as store owners following him in the store, and crime in the ghetto. This was one of the songs that a youth in Texas blamed for his shooting of a state trooper, as in the outro of the song, Tupac questions the authority for not dealing with these issues and he curses out the CIA, the FBI, and then president George H.

The population in 2011 was 16,882,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 548.74 km2. History The first documents that cite Valpa√ßos date back to the 12th century. Its toponymy evolved from pre-national settlements, and started as a small enclave inhabited by nobles and signeurial family estates, attracted by the privileges given for settling so close to the Spanish border. The nascent Portuguese community was susceptible to attacks from Spain. The establishment of border settlements fixed the border. Historically, Vale de Pa√ßo (and later Vale de Pa√ßos until the 19th century) was an area with roots in the Roman period of settlement, yet influenced by Germanic settlers before Portugal became a Kingdom. The most important event in the regions history occurred in the 19th century. On 16 November 1846, during the Patuleia conflict, a movement that was apolitical turned bloody, resulting in the deaths of 200 people, before the battle proceeded into the lands of Mur√ßa. Geography Monte de Santa Isabel in the area of Cancelo Valpa√ßos is located in the northern interior of Portugal in the Alto Tr√°s-os-Montes region, and part of the district of Vila Real. It is confined in the north by the municipality of Chaves, to the east by Mirandela and Vinhais, to the south by Mur√ßa and Mirandela and in the west by Chaves and Vila Pouca de Aguiar. From north to south, the Transmontanan relief is exemplified by planar stretches of the Iberian Meseta, with altitudes between 700‚Äì800 metres above sea level, tending to have a regular profile north of the Douro River.Pierre Birot (1946)A.

The important link is the 206 to A24, which links Valpa√ßos with Vila Real, Viseu and internationally to Spain (Espanha‚ÄìVerin-A52 roadway), and the national A7 which permits a rapid connection with the coast (Guimar√£es, Braga and Porto). The ancillary connection to the national 213 also permits a rapid connection to the IP4, which links Valpa√ßos with Porto, Vila Real and Bragan√ßa.

The 4th Baron Palmer. It was completely rebuilt between 1901 and 1903 and has sumptuous interiors with a silver-plated staircase. The proprietor, Sir James Miller, 2nd Baronet (1864‚Äì1906), told the architect, John Kinross, that there was no budget: \\"It doesn't matter\\". The house is a Category A listed building and the surrounding area, which includes the farm complex at Buxley, is listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. Origins Manderston was an estate of the powerful Hume family, and their tower house appears on General Roy's map of 1750. Alexander Hume, of Manderston, de jure 5th Earl of Dunbar (1651‚Äì1720), seems to be the last member of this family who owned the estate.G. E. Cockayne, Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, extant, extinct or dormant, Vol. III (D to F) (London 1890) On 14 October 1689, King William III & II confirmed the Earldom of Dunbar to him, exemplifying the previous confirmation thereof by King Charles II. The estate was later owned for a short time by the head of the Swinton family, who now resides at Kimmerghame House nearby, and from whom the actress Tilda Swinton is descended. The present big house at Manderston incorporates the earlier Georgian house built about 1790 for Dalhousie Watherston (1752‚Äì1803). Buildings The original c.1790 house underwent alterations in 1870 and was then extensively remodelled by John Kinross at the start of the 20th century. It is one of several Category A listed buildings in the estate along with the stables, a boat house and a gamekeeper's cottage; all of which were built by Kinross. Kinross was also responsible for the group of buildings at Buxley at the north of the estate. Near to the house is a Category C listed cricket pavilion. Manderston cricket club was founded in 1899 and is one of the oldest in Scotland. The pavilion, built c.1900, was renovated in 1999 as part of the club's centenary celebrations following a successful Heritage Lottery Funding bid.

Sir James Miller, 2nd Baronet, had married Eveline, daughter of Alfred, 4th Baron Scarsdale, and his grand house remodelling scheme was said to be to remind his wife of the splendour of her family home, Kedleston Hall. They had no children and the estate passed to his brother John Alexander Miller, 3rd Baronet, (1867‚Äì1918). He also had no children by either of his two wives, and the estate passed to his sister Amy Elizabeth Miller, the present Lord Palmer's great-grandmother.

It contains a relic, the Moi-e-Muqqadas, believed by many Muslims of Kashmir to be Muhammad's hair.\\"Moslems Riot Over Theft of Sacred Relic\\", Chicago Tribune, 29 December 1963, p1 The name of the shrine comes from the Farsi word Hazrat, meaning \\"respected\\", and the Kashmiri word bal, meaning \\"place\\". Thus it means the place which is given high regards and is respected among the people. The shrine is situated on the Northern bank of the Dal Lake, Srinagar, and is considered to be Kashmir's holiest Muslim shrine. The shrine is known by many names including Hazratbal, Assar-e- Sharief, Madinat-us-Sani, or simply Dargah Sharif. History and present status A view of the Hazratbal shrine The mosque contains strands of Muhammad's hair, often referred to as \\"the relic of Hazratbal shrine\\" or simply, \\"the relic\\". The relic was first brought to Kashmir by Syed Abdullah, a purported descendant of Muhammad who left Medina and settled in Bijapur, near Hyderabad in 1635. When Syed Abdullah died, his son Syed Hamid inherited the relic. Following the Mughal conquest of the region, Syed Hamid was stripped of his family estates. Finding himself unable to care for the relic, he sold it to a wealthy Kashmiri businessman Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai. However, when the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb came to know of what had transpired, he had the relic seized and sent to the shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer, and had Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai imprisoned in Delhi for possessing the relic. Later, realizing his mistake, Aurangzeb decided to restore the relic to Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai and to allow him to take it to Kashmir. However, Khwaja Nur- ud-Din Eshai had already died in imprisonment. In 1700, the relic finally reached Kashmir, along with the body of Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai. There, Inayat Begum, daughter of Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai, became a custodian of the relic and established the shrine. Since then, her male descendants have been caretakers of the relic. Dr Manzoor Banday, Head Cleric of Hazratbal Shrine displaying the holy relic on the occasion of Eid e Milad un Nabi, the birthday of Prophet Muhammad. Her male descendants belong to what is known as the Banday family. Currently (as of 2019), 3 main members care for the holy relic: Dr. Manzoor Ahmad Banday, Ishaq Banday and Mohiuddin Banday. The Holy Relic is displayed for public viewing only on special occasions like the birthday of Prophet Muhammad and his 4 main companions, Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique, Hazrat Umar ibn Khattab, Hazrat Usman ibn Affan and Hazrat Ali. The caretakers of the shrine are known as Nishandehs. The eldest male heirs of the previous Nishandeh continues the legacy of displaying the relic when the current Nishandeh passes away. Dr Manzoor Banday, head cleric of the shrine dispaying the relic inside the mosque to the general public on the occasion of birthday of Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique. Hazratbal relic disappearance episode The relic was reported to have disappeared on 27 December 1963. There were mass protests all over the state on the disappearance of the Moi-e-Muqaddas (the Hair of the Prophet) with hundreds of thousands out in the streets. The Awami Action Committee was formed to recover the relic. On 31 December, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru made a broadcast to the nation on the disappearance of the sacred relic. The relic was recovered on 4 January 1964.

It is also found further east, to the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada, but is much less common beyond the Great Plains and is restricted to specialized habitats. It is found in 27 states and four Canadian provinces. Description Prairie dropseed is a perennial bunchgrass whose mound of leaves is typically from high and across. Its flowering stems (culms) grow from tall, extending above the leaves. The flower cluster is an airy panicle long with many branches. They terminate in small spikelets, which each contain a single fertile floret. When it blooms, the floret has three reddish anthers and a short feathery stigma. If it is pollinated, the floret produces a nearly round seed long. At the base of the spikelet are two bracts (glumes), one of them long and the other long. The bracts each are long and tapered, with sharply pointed tips. Around the floret are a lemma and palea, each about long, though the palea is sometimes longer than the lemma. Prairie dropseed is a fine-textured grass with long, narrow leaves that arch outward, forming attractive, round tufts. The leaves range in color from a rich green hue in summer to a golden rust color in the fall. Foliage is resilient enough to resist flattening by snow, so it provides year-round interest. From late July to mid-September, the grass blooms with rusty-tan flowers that rise in height. It occurs in a wide range of soils, doing well in moist to dry conditions. It is much less common in wetlands. Ecology It is a larval host to the Poweshiek skipper.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Uses The grass is cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens because of its attractive bunchgrass form. Because of its drought tolerance, it has been used on green roofs. The seedhead is sometimes described as having the vague scent of fresh popcorn, cilantro, or sunflower seeds. Prairie dropseed is also used for roadside revegetation and prairie restoration projects. It is difficult to establish by direct seeding. Transplanting greenhouse-grown seedlings is a more effective method of establishing it. Native Americans ground the seeds of the grass to make flour, and many species of birds eat the seeds.

It forms part of the greater township of Ibhayi and the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality which governs Port Elizabeth and its surroundings. History It was established in 1902, and was the first officially black residential area in the greater Port Elizabeth area. Prior to the establishment of New Brighton as the first black township, there was a demolishing of the then Black residential area in 1902 where the personal belongings of the Black residents were arbitrarily destroyed, and restrictions imposed upon their travel outside the demarcated area. The racially segregated township of New Brighton was established in 1902 on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, some 8 km north of the city centre, to house families who had been forcefully removed in the previous years.South African History Online http://www.sahistory.org.za/places/new- brighton-location . Many of Athol Fugard's plays are set in New Brighton. As part of the governing modus-operandi of the Colonial Government of the 19th century, that would eventually lead to the Land Act of 1913 a decade later, where policy was formulated on the basis of ethnicity, townships, including that of New Brighton, were established for the exclusive use of Black residents who were not housed by employers, and who could not afford to purchase property in the suburbs. In 1855, Stranger's Location, known as Emaxambeni in isiXhosa was established. Stranger's Location spilled over into Cooper's Kloof in the 1860s and became a separate municipal location in 1877. The Reservoir Location off Mount Road was established by the Municipality in 1883. The largest privately owned township, Gubbs Location, was established in the 1860s. A case of bubonic plague in Gubb's Location in 1901 set in place events that led to demolition of these townships and the creation of New Brighton. Port Elizabeth recorded a total of 105 cases - 21 Whites and 84 Blacks - of bubonic plague in 1901. This was the direct result of Argentinian fodder and horses being imported into South Africa by the British military during the South African War. After the first case was reported, the residents from the various townships agreed to meet. During the meeting it was agreed that a single township outside Port Elizabeth had to be built. Following recommendations from public health officials, demolished houses number 325 in Port Elizabeth and 950 in the Stranger's location,The Reservoir Location and Gubb's Location townships in 1903. The establishment of New Brighton was facilitated by the Colonial Government's purchase of the farms known as Cradock Place and Deal Party for the sum of ¬£20 000. The portion set for the establishment of New Brighton was situated north of Port Elizabeth in area which was deemed unsuitable for industrial use. The choice of a site for New Brighton outside the town's boundaries was determined by favourable health conditions in the area, and the fact that it would allow for effective residential segregation. These were on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, far away from the city centre and white suburbs where New Brighton residents were employed. In its very early days, Port Elizabeth was planned in a manner that did not allow for different races to mix and this was spelt out as such in colonial policy and regulations. White and Coloured people, even though New Brighton was established as an exclusively Black township, flouted Government rules and built homes in New Brighton, albeit only a few. By the year 1911, New Brighton‚Äôs population had grown to 3,650 persons, almost all of them Black, this compromising of 52 Whites, 3414 Black Africans and 184 Coloureds.Msila, V. (2014) A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013. SUN PRESS The oldest and iconic location within the New Brighton area is the Red Location, which was developed in 1902-1903, and made up of corrugated iron shacks which were built in a barrack-type fashion. Accommodation for individuals in New Brighton was allotted on a first-come, first-served basis. The Government initially planned to rehouse only about 1 500 people in the Location even though estimates suggested that about three times that number of Africans resided in Port Elizabeth and slum areas, and that a similar number lived outside the municipal boundaries. Huts were erected in this order: one and two-bedroomed family accommodation for 'ordinary native labourers' and 'civilised natives' also known as Class A and B, and dormitories for 'single men' called Class C. Rents in New Brighton of between 20s. and 30s. per month for family quarters and 8s. per month for single quarters(Class C). At the end of 1903 the population of New Brighton was 2 125. Some residents from the demolished townships of Stranger's location,The Reservoir Location and Gubb's Location refused to move to New Brighton and opted for Korsten. In Korsten, they could own land. By January 1910, the population of New Brighton had reached 3156. New Brighton today Today, New Brighton is made up of many more locations namely White location, Elundini, KwaFord, Boast Village, Masangwanaville and Chris Hani informal settlement, amongst others. New Brighton is also popular for the sons and daughters it birthed, who would go on to be prominent anti-apartheid activists and leaders of post-apartheid, democratic South Africa. Amongst the prominent South African people born and bred in New Brighton include actor and playwright Ken Gampu, John Kani, Nomhle Nkonyeni, ANC stalwart Vusi Pikoli and Black Consciousness co-founder Barney Pityana.

Some of the prominent names in the South African art scene today ‚Äì a new generation following those mentioned above ‚Äì that were also born and bred in New Brighton include poet Mxolisi Nyezwa and dramatist-playwright Mzwandile Zwai Mgijima. Many of the historic places that served as cultural and political hubs in New Brighton and Port Elizabeth at large in the 1960s have either been demolished or changed to suit contemporary needs. Notable amongst these include the former Rio Bioscope, opened in 1950 on Aggrey Road, is today being used as a church by the Cathedral Church of Umzi Wasi Topiya, naming it Kaizer Ngxwana after the anti-apartheid struggle stalwart.

History Wedderburn Castle is the historic family seat of the Home of Wedderburn family, cadets of the Home family (today Earls of Home). It was designed and constructed 1771‚Äì5 by the famous architect brothers Robert Adam and James Adam, with the work superintendent being James Nisbet, for Patrick Home of Billie, who had already completed Paxton House (using James Adam and Nisbet, with Robert Adam doing the interiors ). With battlemented three-storey elevations in the typical Adam Castle style, the apparent symmetry of Wedderburn Castle conceals a rectangular courtyard, originally filled by the 17th-century (or earlier) tower house, also known as Wedderburn Castle, of which only a heraldic panel remains. It was demolished in the early 19th century, leaving the courtyard accessed through an archway at the back. The approach Wedderburn Castle main gate The castle is approached by way of the north or Lion Gate of 1794 (see photograph at left) and the long drive (leading from the West gate), which passes the 18th-century stables (a square court entered through a pedimented archway) and the staff cottages, before continuing to the castle. The West Gate is another archway, but defined by screen walls and gabled lodges. The castle interior Entering the front of the castle through a large porch (above which is the Home of Wedderburn coat of arms), there is a double staircase with an iron balustrade leading up to a balcony, behind which is a long gallery connecting the drawing room and the dining room. Across the hall and above the front door is a long minstrel gallery, again connecting the drawing room and the dining room. On the right of the staircase are the drawing room, and the morning room (previously the smoking room), beyond which is the ballroom. There are several fine chimneypieces, the best being by Piranesi. To the left are the dining room, and a further staircase leading up to the bedrooms. The ground floor has a large kitchen and further bedrooms, originally for servants. Coat of arms of George Home of Wedderburn and his heirs The owners The Earls of Douglas had the feudal superiority of the lands of Wedderburn circa 1413, when Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas granted them as a feu to \\"his esquire, David de Home\\". In a charter dated at Dunbar Castle 29 February 1413, George de Dunbar, Earl of March, confirmed the previous charter granted by \\"his beloved brother, Archibald, Earl of Douglas\\", the superiority having passed, by forfeiture, from the Dunbar family to Douglas. By 1550 the Homes had acquired the superiority of Wedderburn, as is indicated by a Sasine in favour of David Home, brother-german (full brother) and heir of George Home of Wedderburn (who was killed at the Battle of Pinkie), wherein it is stated that the heir and his brother held it of the Crown in chief. Daughters of this branch of the Home family would keep Home and add it to their married name ‚Äì hence subsequent generations of the family having variations including Forman Home, Milne Home, Home Robertson, and Home Miller.

It is traversed by the east-west Yellowhead Highway, which crosses the Continental Divide via the Yellowhead Pass. All of these features are named after Pierre Bostonais, a M√©tis guide known for his blonde hair. The county surrounds, but does not govern, the towns of Edson and Hinton. Mixed agriculture predominates in the flatter east, while many residents in the west half of the county are acreage residents drawn by the Rocky Mountain scenery. Much of the county's population lives in small hamlets, established for agriculture, forestry, and mining. Although few inhabitants remain, Robb and Cadomin were once the centre of the bustling Alberta Coal Branch. The nearby ghost town of Mountain Park was the highest inhabited community in the British Empire, at 1,890 meters above sea level. Although mining, forestry, and agriculture remain economic mainstays, Yellowhead County also has a growing tourist industry. Local attractions include provincial parks, such as William A. Switzer and Obed Lake, and unique landmarks such as the Cadomin Cave. Its proximity to Jasper National Park makes it a popular destination for activities forbidden within park boundaries, such as hunting and off-highway vehicle riding.

Fatima Masumeh was the sister of the eighth Imam Reza and the daughter of the seventh Imam Musa al-Kadhim (Tabari 60). In Shia Islam, women are often revered as saints if they are close relatives to one of the Twelver Imams. Fatima Masumeh is therefore honored as a saint, and her shrine in Qom is considered one of the most significant Shi'i shrines in Iran. Every year, thousands of Shi'i Muslims travel to Qom to honor Fatima Masumeh and ask her for blessings. Also buried within the shrine are three daughters of the ninth Twelver Shƒ´‚Äòah ImƒÅm Muhammad al-Taqƒ´. Specifications The mosque consists of a burial chamber, three courtyards and three large prayer halls, totalling an area of . The three prayer halls are named: TabƒÅtabƒÅ'ƒ´, BƒÅlƒÅ Sar, and A‚Äòdham. Visiting the Shrine The golden dome above the mausoleum Decorative muqarnas vaulting in the iwan entrance of Fatima Masumeh Shrine in atabki sahn, Qom, Iran. Though Shi'i theology formally states that the relatives of the Imams, or imamzadehs, hold a lower status than the Imams, popular Shi'ism still strongly venerates imamzadehs. In Iran, there are many more burial places of the Imams' relatives than there are for the Imams themselves. Imamzadehs are considered to be close to God and religiously pious because of their close relation to Imams. Shi'is commonly travel on pilgrimages to shrines of imamzadehs, such as the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, the sister of the 8th Imam 'Ali al-Rida, in Qom, Iran. Men and women seek cures to ailments, solutions to problems, and forgiveness of sins at these sites. Many hadiths, or teachings, are recorded from Shi'i Imams praising the veneration of Fatima Masumeh, and proclaiming that those who make a pilgrimage to her Shrine will \\"certainly be admitted to heaven.\\" Fatima Masumeh's Shrine in Qom is crowded every day of the year with Shi'i men, women, and children from all around the world. Some stay for hours or days praying at the mosque and circumambulating her tomb. The economy of Qom has become reliant on this pilgrimage for the tourism it brings. In turn, Qom has remained conservative and traditional to maintain a pious environment for pilgrims. Many miracles have been recorded as taking place at this shrine, and they are documented in a special office within the shrine complex. Some are published in the shrines monthly newspaper, the Payam-e Astan. Pilgrims at the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh follow rituals that have been passed down for centuries. Imam Ali al-Rida, Fatima Masumeh's brother, outlined these ritual acts as he described the way he visited her Shrine. The prayer Imam al-Rida dictated to his sister continues to be part of the pilgrimage. Since the Safavid period, additional rituals have been added that are now typical for many Shi'i pilgrimages including ritual washing beforehand, dressing in perfumed clothing, and entering the site with one's right foot. History of the Shrine Early history Since the beginning of Qom's history in the 7th century, the city has been associated with Shi'ism and set apart from the Sunni caliphate. Many Shi'i hadiths referred to Qom as a \\"place of refuge for believers,\\" calling it a deeply religious place. After Fatima Masumeh's death in Qom and the construction of her Shrine, scholars began to gather in Qom and the city gained its reputation for religious learning. Today, Qom is still noted for its religious seminaries and organizations. Fatima Masumeh died in Qom in 201 A.H. as she travelled to join her brother, Imam Ali al-Rida in Khorasan. The caravan she travelled in was attacked in Saveh by the Abbasid Sunnis, and 23 of Fatima Masumeh's family and friends were killed (Jaffer). Fatima Masumeh was then poisoned by a woman from the Sunni enemies, fell ill, and asked to be taken to Qom, where she died. Fatima Masumeh's host in Qom buried her in his plot of land. The style of Fatima Masumeh's Shrine has developed over many centuries. At first, her tomb was covered with a bamboo canopy. Fifty years later, this was replaced by a more durable domed building, at the request of the daughter of Imam Muhammad at-Taqƒ´, Sayyida Zaynab. The family of Sayyida Zainab later added a further two domes to the Shrine. These architectural projects marked the beginning of female patronage of the tomb of Fatima Masumeh.  Safavid period  Islamic architecture in the shrine of Fatemeh Masoumeh. In 1519, Tajlu Khanum, the wife of Shah Isma'il I, led a project to improve the drainage around the Shrine, embellish the Shrine with an iwan and two minarets, and reconstruct the tomb chamber as a domed octagon. During the Safavid dynasty, the women of this family were very active in embellishing the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh. In times of war, Safavid royal women found refuge in Qom, and likely compared their situation to that of Fatima Masumeh. These women donated beautiful fabrics and other items to the Shrine. Shah Abbas I of the Safavids did not patronize the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh as much as he did other shrines of Imams, but he did offer books to the Shrine's seminary library. Over the years, many Safavids of royal birth were buried close to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh. Modern history Eid al-Fitr prayer, Fatima Masuma Shrine, 2017 From 1795‚Äì1796, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar converted two Safavid sahn or courtyards into one large courtyard and, in 1803, fixed the golden dome. In 1883, Amin al-Sultan added the new sahn e-jadid or \\"New Court\\" to the Shrine complex. During Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 Iranian Revolution, Qom was named \\"the birthplace\\" of this movement. Khomeini studied in Qom and lived there at the beginning and end of the Revolution. Aspects of the culture of Qom, including the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, were used to unite the Iranian people over significant historical and mythical events. Khomeini used images of the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh in posters, money, and stamps created during the Revolution. Khomeini also constructed an addition to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh and added more space for pilgrims. In addition, the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini utilizes architectural elements that are similar to Fatima Masumeh's Shrine, such as the golden dome. See Mausoleum of Khomeini.

The preferred pronunciation of the town name is , which differs from the pronunciation used for the city of Norwich, England. The origin of Norwich, Ontario, is more likely Norwich in upper New York State, the area from which the pioneering families emigrated in the early 19th century, where the community was known as Norwichville. Oxford County Road 59 (formerly Highway 59) is the major north‚Äìsouth highway through much of the township, including the community of Norwich proper. The local economy is largely agricultural, based on corn, soybean, and wheat production with dairy farming in the north part of the township and tobacco, vegetable, and ginseng farming to the south. Slowly, ginseng and traditional cash crops are replacing the former cash crop - tobacco, as demand shrinks. Communities Formerly East Oxford, North and South Norwich Townships, modern Norwich includes the communities of Beaconsfield, Bond's Corners, Brown's Corners, Burgessville, Cornell, Creditville, Curries, Eastwood, Hawtrey, Hink's Corners, Holbrook, Milldale, Muir, Newark, New Durham, Norwich, Oriel, Otterville, Oxford Centre, Rock's Mills, Rosanna, Springford, Summerville, Blows, and Vandecar. History Upon his arrival in the province in 1792, the first proclamation issued by John Graves Simcoe, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada while still at Kingston, announced the names and boundaries he had decided upon as political boundaries for Upper Canada. For areas lying to the west of Kingston, he decided that county names would be a \\"mirror of Britain\\". To accomplish this, the sequence of names for counties along Lake Ontario became Northumberland, Durham, York and Lincoln, and for counties along Lake Erie, the names became Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent. (This was the same sequence of county names in place along the eastern seacoast of England, running from the Scottish boundary down to the English Channel.) The proclamation defined the northern boundary of Norfolk County as being the Thames River. Norwich and Dereham townships were originally within the land area designated as belonging to Norfolk County in Upper Canada, and were named after the towns of Norwich and Dereham in Norfolk County in England.Proclamation of July 16, 1792 Gov. Simcoe with several other government officers, guided by a party of Six Nations warriors, conducted a wilderness tour on foot down and back up the length of the Thames River in 1793 and decided to assign additional place names to mirror those they knew along the Thames River in England. Middlesex County was the name assigned to the area around a town site reserved at the \\"lower forks\\" in the river, to be called London; Dorchester was the name for a town site at the \\"middle forks\\", and the area around the \\"upper forks\\" was to be Oxford - the same sequence of names as found along the Thames in England. When legislation was passed in Upper Canada in 1798 to implement these new divisions, Norwich and Dereham were separated from Norfolk County and added to the new Oxford County, which included also Burford, Blenheim, Blandford and Oxford townships - names drawn from Oxfordshire in England. Shortly after returning from this tour, Simcoe received in March 1793 a petition from Thomas Ingersoll and associates asking for grant of a township to which they promised to bring settlers from New England. Simcoe was impressed that the list of associates in the group was headed by the name of Gideon Bostwick, a well- known Church of England (Anglican) missionary in Massachusetts, and the group was granted the township of Oxford-on-the-Thames. The only way to bring settlers into such a wilderness area township was to first build a road from Brantford up to the Thames River, a distance of , and Thomas Ingersoll arranged that work over the course of the next two years, involving numerous journeys back and forth by those involved. In all of this, the first ones to become permanently settled in the township were likely Samuel Canfield Sr. and his wife and sons, who agreed to make their new home into a half-way stopping point for travellers along the road, at what became known as Oxford Centre. This is commemorated with plaques at the cemetery there and in front of the elementary school a short distance to the east along what is now known as \\"The Old Stage Road\\".\\"Oxford Centre's place in Ontario's Bostwick region\\" in Norwich District Historical Society Newsletter, published in three parts in 2012 The Bostwicks, Ingersolls and Canfields were all New England families who had made their start in the New World in the 1600s, and frontier living had been second nature to them for generations. The Bostwicks and Canfields were kinfolk by marriage and as community leaders in several places. Samuel Canfield Sr. was particularly valuable to the Oxford settlement because he had already lived the life of starting a new settlement in the mountains of New Hampshire. In the early 1770s he and wife Lucy joined a group of Connecticut families who had been granted the wilderness township of Marlow there, and Samuel soon became a town leader, elected one of the selectmen for the community and appointed captain of the local militia company. When the War of Independence came, he rallied the company to support the Continental Army. For this he is still revered as a local hero in Marlow.The Marlow Historical Society has published many details of the Canfield family story there. For he and his family, however, the Marlow years also brought sorrow, because three daughters died and are buried there, two of them lost together in a house fire in 1789.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/113423204/esther-canfield Samuel complained of hearing voices which eventually drove him to quit Marlow, and the family was living in southern Vermont by the time Gideon Bostwick was traveling his Anglican mission circuit which reached there, spreading word of the township grant which had been received in far-away Oxford. Samuel and family agreed to join the new venture, but he brought with him his own faith as a Baptist. He had been a Baptist preacher in Marlow, a community which had been drawn to a missionary named Caleb Blood in the early 1770s, and Caleb Bloodfunded by the Shaftesbury Association http://baptisthistoryhomepage.com/shaftsbury.cl.index.html became the first Baptist missionary in western Upper Canada thirty years later.Stuart Ivison and Fred Rosser, The Baptists in Upper and Lower Canada before 1820 (University of Toronto Press, 1956), chapter 3 Settlement in the former Norwich Township came more than fifteen years after Oxford Township. The Norwich settlement was founded by two men: Peter Lossing and Peter De Long. Both were from New York. Peter Lossing's house was the first one in Norwich. It now stands by the old Quaker Meeting House. Both men where Quakers. The town of Norwich commenced as a completely Quaker settlement. In 1799, the Township of Norwich was laid out by surveyor William Hambly into lines and concessions and lots. The post office dates from 1829 onward. The township was divided into North and South Norwich Townships in 1855. The Norwich Quaker Settlement Quaker Cap Description of Quaker settlement in Norwich township, from Gourlay's Statistical Account of Upper Canada, published in 1822 In 1809 Peter Lossing, a member of the Society of Friends from Dutchess County, New York, visited Norwich Township, and in June, 1810, with his brother-in-law, Peter De Long, purchased of land in this area. That autumn Lossing brought his family to Upper Canada and early in 1811 settled in Norwich Township. The De Long family and nine others, principally from Dutchess County, joined Lossing the same year and by 1820 an additional group of about fifty had settled within the tract. Many were Quakers and a frame meeting house, planned in 1812, was erected in 1817. These resourceful pioneers founded one of the most successful Quaker communities in Upper Canada. The Otterville grist mill and Otter Creek sawmills The first mill on the site was built, in 1807, by partners John Earle and Paul Averill Jr. The Averill family was from the Great Barrington area in Massachusetts, where Thomas Ingersoll had lived before coming to Oxford. Paul Averill, Sr. had developed mills in Townsend township in the 1790s. John Earle married Paul's daughter Mary and with Paul Averill Jr. managed the Townsend mills. In 1806, Earle purchased the land surrounding the mill site at Otterville and with his brother-in-law Paul (sometimes referred to as Paul Avery) built the first grist mill on the site. The mill standing today, built in 1845 by Edward Bullock and Herbert Hilliard Cameron Tufford, is run by water power supplied by a dam on the river. The South Norwich Historical Society, on a lease basis, maintains this historic site and offers tours on request. Located in the centre of the village, the mill and its surrounding meadow is the site of an annual barbecue. The pioneers of Oxford Township were slow to develop mills because of lack of any easy mode of transportation to send products to market, but Norwich township had the natural benefit of Otter Creek running through the township on a course which flowed south to Lake Erie and what became the harbour at Port Burwell. By the 1820s there were several sawmills along the creek in Norwich Township, supplying not only local needs but also rafting sawn timber and lumber down the creek to Port Burwell, for export to New York state. Dairy farming and cheese factories Oxford Township's pioneer farms were already famous for butter and cheese-making before the War of 1812, and Norwich Township's Quaker pioneers were quick to follow. In response to a questionnaire from author and agitator Robert Gourlay in 1817, Norwich farmers submitted a detailed chart showing the progress in the Quaker settlement in its first five years, which Gourlay published in his book about conditions in Upper Canada (see chart on this page). It shows that the 11 pioneer Quaker families brought with them more cows (28) than horses or oxen, and after five years had nearly tripled the number of cows being kept.Gourlay's two-volume Statistical account of Upper Canada, compiled with a view to a grand system of emigration was published in England in 1822, the culmination of five years of agitation following the hopeless conditions he found in Dereham township when he came from Scotland to view 1,000 acres his wife had been bequeathed by her uncle, Niagara merchant Robert Hamilton By the 1840s, dairy farmers in Oxford, Norwich and Dereham townships were competing each year for top honours at agricultural fairs around the province for butter and cheese-making prizes. In the 1860s, Norwich farmers were the first in Canada to adopt the American factory system for cheese-making, with two different approaches competing for acceptance. Andes Smith took the approach of contracting with other farmers to buy their milk and haul it to a factory on his farm using a tanker wagon. Whatever profit or loss came from manufacturing cheese was his own. Harvey Farrington was a cheese factory specialist who had come to Norwich from New York state, and at his factory outside Norwichville he contracted with farmers to haul their milk to him and receive payment based on what came from cheese sales after Farrington deducted two cents per pound for his services in running the factory and making the cheese. Smith was first and was the more innovative one, gaining international recognition in 1865 for manufacturing a cheese, but he went bankrupt the following year. Farrington's co-op system became the good news story that ended up being immortalized in published histories and on historical plaques.Ron Shaw, Cheese Stakes (2017) Amalgamation In 1975, Oxford County underwent countywide municipal restructuring. The Village of Norwich and the Townships of East Oxford, North Norwich and South Norwich were amalgamated to create the Township of Norwich. The Tornado of 1979 On August 7, 1979 at around 7:00 pm, Norwich was struck by the Woodstock Tornado, one of the largest tornadoes ever to occur in Southern Ontario. The storm cut a path of destruction across Norwich Township from Blows to New Durham, leaving the community of Oxford Centre in a state of total destruction. Several homes, the General Store, Anglican church and the Community Hall were levelled. The United Church at the top of the hill had its roof taken completely off and extensive interior damage, but all seven stained glass windows were left intact. One of the homes damaged was that of the last Ingersoll family member resident in the county, and narrowly missed destroying a cherished family keepsake album, which afterwards underwent conservation work at the Oxford County Archives and is now proudly displayed at the museum in Ingersoll. Two people lost their lives that day and one senior succumbed a few months later, never returning from hospital. All that remained of Oxford Centre's Anglican church was the foundation and one door hanging from its frame. Neighbours, even people from miles away were kind enough to return little bits of the original church, which was built in 1867. A silver paten and silver flagon, the communion rail, a credenza and parts of two of the stained glass windows along with a few other artifacts were recovered and are now displayed in the Narthex. The Church was soon rebuilt to the original plans. The F4 tornado, which had its beginning north west of Woodstock cut a swath all the way to Waterford of approximately 60 km and at its widest point near Oxford Centre was about 400m wide. The Norwich Tornado of 1998 On the afternoon of June 2, 1998, a severe weather outbreak affected Southern Ontario. At around 3:50 pm, there was a report of a tornado touching down in Holbrook and heading straight for Norwich. The tornado hit Norwich around 4:05 pm, damaging trees, farm equipment, barns, houses, and the wooden Holy Trinity Anglican Church (1867). Three people were injured, and the next day, Environment Canada confirmed that an F2 or F3 tornado had hit the village. Following a decision by the parish, Holy Trinity Anglican Church was not rebuilt as the congregation opted to join with St. John's Anglican Church, Otterville. However, a stone monument commemorating the church continues to mark the site.Kuhn, Robert J.

Since 2003  The penal code and censorship The penal code of Iraq does have some provisions that do address the issue of censorship. In 2003, the Iraqi penal code was reverted to its 1988 edition with some revisions drafted by Paul Bremer and later the Iraqi national government. Several provisions in the current penal code address the limitations placed on the freedom of the press and communicative media, namely; Paragraph 215 ‚Äì Any person who produces, imports, exports or obtains a picture, written material or sign with intent to trade, distribute, display or exhibit such material, which, by its nature, endangers the public security or brings the country into disrepute unless he was acting in good faith is punishable by detention plus a fine not exceeding 300 dinars or by one of those penalties. Paragraph 220 ‚Äì If five or more people are assembled in a public place, thereby endangering the public security and the public authorities order them to disperse, any person who is given that order and refuses to comply with it is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year plus a fine not exceeding 100 dinars or by one of those penalties. Paragraph 403 ‚Äì Any person who produces, imports, publishes, possesses, obtains or translates a book, printed or other written material, drawing, picture, film, symbol or other thing that violates the public integrity or decency with intent to exploit or distribute such material is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 2 years plus a fine not exceeding 200 dinars or by one of those penalties. The same penalty applies to any person who advertises such material or displays it in public or sells, hires or offers it for sale or hire even though it is not in public or to any person who distributes or submits it for distribution by any means. If the offense is committed with intent to deprave, it is considered to be an aggravating circumstances. Paragraph 404 ‚Äì Any person who himself or through some mechanical means sings or broadcasts in a public place obscene or indecent songs or statements is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year or by a fine not exceeding 100 dinars. Paragraph 434 ‚Äì Insult is the imputation to another of something dishonourable or disrespectful or the hurting of his feelings even though it does not include an imputation to him of a particular matter. Any person who insults another is punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year plus a fine not exceeding 100 dinars or by one of those penalties. If such insult Is published in a newspaper or publication or medium it is considered an aggravating circumstance. Paragraph 438 ‚Äì The following persons are punishable by a period of detention not exceeding 1 year plus a fine not exceeding 100 dinars or by one of those penalties: (1) Any person who publishes in any way a picture, remark or information in respect of the private or family life of another, even though such information is true and such publication causes him offense. (2) Any person other than those mentioned in Paragraph 328 who is privy to information contained in a letter, telex or telephone conversation and he discloses such information to a person other than for whom it is intended and such disclosure causes harm to another. The Constitution and censorship In 2005, a new Constitution was ratified by Iraqi voters, which have implications for Constitutional rights and censorship in Iraq. Among the civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution include; Section 1. Article 7 - No entity or program, under any name, may adopt racism, terrorism, the calling of others infidels, ethnic cleansing, or incite, facilitate, glorify, promote, or justify thereto, especially the Saddamist Baath in Iraq and its symbols, regardless of the name that it adopts. This may not be part of the political pluralism in Iraq. This will be organized by law.https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iraq_2005.pdf?lang=en Section 2. Article 36 - The state guarantees in a way that does not violate public order and morality: a. Freedom of expression, through all means. b. Freedom of press, printing, advertisement, media and publication. c. Freedom of assembly and peaceful demonstration. This shall be regulated by law. Section 2. Article 38 - The State shall guarantee in a way that does not violate public order and morality: First. Freedom of expression using all means. Second. Freedom of press, printing, advertisement, media and publication. Third. Freedom of assembly and peaceful demonstration, and this shall be regulated by law. Section 2. Article 40 - The freedom of communication, and mail, telegraphic, electronic, and telephonic correspondence, and other correspondence shall be guaranteed and may not be monitored, wiretapped or disclosed except for legal and security necessity and by a judicial decision. Internet censorship Only 17.6% of Iraq's population had access to the Internet at the end of 2013. The ONI found no evidence of filtering from Iraq in August 2009 in all 4 areas for those which the government tests political filtering, social filtering, conflict/security, and monitoring of Internet tools. Iraq's constitution provides for the rights of freedom of speech and press, and the government respects these rights in practice. There are no overt government restrictions that the government monitor Internet chat rooms or e-mail. Those freedoms are provided so that it doesn't violate public order and morality or express support for the banned Baath Party or for altering the country's borders by violent means.  Censorship in Iraq: 1979 - 2003  Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq as a single-party dictatorship from 1979 - 2003, with the Ba'athist Party being the only lawful party in Iraq. During this era, political criticism or dissent of the Iraqi government was illegal. Similar restrictions against political expression were found in the Iraqi Constitution. While elections were sometimes held in Iraq during this time period, they essentially \\"mock\\" elections with Saddam Hussein as the sole candidate. No legitimate free and fair elections were held in Iraq. The Iraqi National government was (in accordance with Article 37 of the Constitution of 1990) limited to the membership of the Revolutionary Command Council. Among other powers, this council had (Article 36) the right to prohibit anything that they felt harmed \\"national unity\\", the \\"objectives of the People\\" or their \\"achievements\\".  Censorship in Iraq during the 1950s - 1979  In the late 1950s - late 1970s, several different political factions fought for control of the Iraqi government. Initially, a series of military leaders ruled Iraq from 1958 - 1968. After, which the Iraqi Baathist Party seized control and was led by a series of party leaders until Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. None of these different governments showed much support for the freedom of speech, press, personal expression and other forms of communications.  Censorship in the Kingdom of Iraq  The Constitution governing the Kingdom of Iraq (1932 - 1958) pledged to respect several civil liberties, specifically; Article 12 - \\"Freedom of expression of opinion, liberty of publication, of meeting together, and of forming and joining associations\\" ... in accordance with whatever laws were enacted by the national government. Article 13 - \\"Islam is the official religion of the State. Freedom to practise the rites; of the different sects of that religion, as observed in Iraq, is guaranteed. Complete freedom of conscience and freedom to practise the various forms of worship, in conformity with accepted customs, is guaranteed to all inhabitants of the country provided that such forms of worship do not conflict with the maintenance of order and discipline or public morality.\\" Article 15 - \\"Art. 15. All postal and telegraphic correspondence and all telephonic communications shall be secret and free from censorship or detention, except in such circumstances and in such manner as may be prescribed by law.\\" See also *Human rights in post-invasion Iraq *Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq *Human rights in pre-Saddam Iraq *Internet censorship and surveillance in Iraq References External links *Iraq: A Tale of Censorship, a 2007 film about a U.S. soldiers accouint of widespread censorship of the media in Iraq Iraq Category:Politics of Iraq Category:Human rights abuses in Iraq ","title":"Censorship in Iraq"},{"id":"4516588","text":"Pir Bakran (, also Romanized as Pƒ´r BakrƒÅn; also known as Pƒ´r BƒÅqerƒÅn; formerly known as Linjan ŸÑŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÜ) is a city and capital of Pir Bakran District, in Falavarjan County, Isfahan Province, Iran.

Blonde-haired and blue-eyed, she is a sweet and cheerful girl with a healthy appetite, but she wonders how so much suffering can come from her existence and blames herself for it. She loses her memory and spends that time with Fulle. They fall in love, but Pacifica loses all memory of him when her memories of her previous life return. She also has a teasing flirtation with Leo who often pledges love and devotion, begging to marry her. Because of the prophecy, shortly before she turns sixteen, Pacifica is stabbed and killed by her twin brother Forsyth, the crown prince, at the end of the show. On the day of her sixteenth birthday, her power to destroy Providence would have reached its zenith and the spell within her would activate. After her death, Pacifica confronts Celia Mauser, the seer who was a vital component in the fight against the aliens during the Genesis Wars and whom Pacifica is a physical recreation of. 5000 years ago, as humans were losing the war with the aliens and were going to be sealed, Browning and the other remaining humans came up with a plan to break free of the sealed world by specifically calculating and scattering DNA to prepare the Providence Breaker-Pacifica ‚Äì who would be able to resist the mind control of the Peacemakers and destroy the very foundations of the system sealing in the humans to free mankind. Despite dying before the power could reach its peak, Pacifica was strong enough so that the destruction of Providence was still possible. After learning why Providence was created, Celia gives Pacifica the choice to determine humanity's future. Even though Pacifica is sympathetic to having a protected, ideal world to live in, she chooses instead to let humans make their own choices, and as a result of this decision, Celia disappears and Providence is destroyed, freeing mankind once and for all. After everything is over and done with and the world is finally safe, Pacifica's life is restored and she returns to her family farm with Shannon, Raquel, and Zefiris. Shannon Casull is the son of Yuhma and Carol Casull, Raquel's younger brother and Pacifica's older foster brother. Shannon is a skilled swordsman who has sworn to defend Pacifica's life no matter what, but he is reserved and calm despite the many difficulties in the Casull siblings' lives. He is a very protective person. Although Pacifica is on his top priority list, he also looks out for Raquel, Winia Chester, the little girl Cin (Cz's compressed form) and eventually Zefiris. He is a practical man and can cook, clean and shop for groceries, but, when provoked, Shannon loses control of himself not listening to anyone. In episode 6, Shannon becomes a temporary Dragon Knight (\\"D-Knight\\") and is capable of using the power of a Dragoon named Zefiris to fight the Peacemakers. When he learns the truth about Zefiris and his sister, however, he loses his trust in Zefiris. During this time, whenever he merges with the Dragoon, it becomes nearly impossible for him defeat the Peacemakers. Later in the series, he gives Zefiris his trust and fully merges with her. The two fight alongside the Gigas (or Gigantes) against the two remaining Peacemakers. He looks almost exactly like Zefiris's old master, Lord Beckham Mauser, due to the genetic engineering used to create him, Pacifica and Raquel, as explained by Zefiris. In the end, Shannon manages to unlock the full power of the D-Knight and helps to retrieve Pacifica after her death, bringing her back to Earth. He later returns to his family farm with Pacifica, Raquel and Zefiris. Raquel Casull is the oldest of the Casull children, Shannon's sister and Pacifica's foster sister. She is a powerful magic-user and able to cast spells faster than many others. She has assumed a motherly role in the family and always maintains a calm, kind attitude. Like Shannon, she has a striking resemblance to Celia and Beckenham Mauser's sister due to the genetic engineering used in their birth. It is however noted that she is often left the odd one out because of Shannon and Pacifica's close relationship. She does not seem to mind, but she is considerably less close to either of her siblings as they are to each other. Her concern for Pacifica is clear in some episodes; for example, when they went to the cave of bugs to look plants for Pacifica's antidote, she says that she does not mind the danger because her sister's life is in danger. Raquel often encourages Shannon's close relationship with Pacifica by sending her brother out to look for and comfort Pacifica. She is the type to comfort Pacifica by doing something, rather than speaking it. Despite her kind, calm and goofy nature, she will not hesitate to strike down anyone in her way of protecting Pacifica or Shannon. Raquel's normal kindness often serves as a cover for a more aggressive and tactical mind that asserts itself whenever Pacifica or Shannon are in danger. Raquel prepared her father, Yuhma, for death and lit the pyre. Toward the end of the series, Raquel starts to become doubtful while separated from Pacifica and Shannon. When she does find Pacifica (with amnesia), she admits that she does not know what to do, still not knowing where her brother is. Her most vulnerable state is during the last episode, as she holds the stabbed Pacifica in her arms. She later returns to her family farm with Pacifica, Shannon and Zefiris. Christopher Armalite Raised as a soldier by the military of the Kingdom of Leinwan, is the leader of the elite army unit Obstinate Arrow. He is an expert fighter and wields a large battle axe that can be folded and concealed. He is the honorable antagonist of the series, but also a developing hero. Ordered to eliminate the Scrapped Princess, he kidnaps Winia Chester to lay a trap for Pacifica's guardians. Shannon beats him in a duel in Glass Canyon and asks him to stay away in exchange for sparing his life. Before Obstinate Arrow can leave the city of Taurus, however, they learn that a Peacemaker (Galil) has come to deal with the Scrapped Princess and the whole city is at risk. The soldiers briefly ally themselves with the Casulls to fend off the Peacemaker's onslaught. To gain access to the castle's resources, Christopher is officially adopted by Obstinate Arrow's superior, Baroness Bairach, becoming Christopher Bairach. He befriends the crown prince, Forsyth, and researches Grendel's prophecies to understand the Scrapped Princess's true destiny. After the Baroness is dismissed from commanding Obstinate Arrow, the team serves under the Major. Christopher arrests Pacifica then, but later helps her escape. Having \\"betrayed\\" the King, he joins the Casulls. When Zefiris asks him why he defends Pacifica, even though he does not carry the guardian gene, he simply answers that it is because he chooses to. After Providence is 'destroyed' and mankind is freed, he marries Winia and becomes good friends with the Casulls, while maintaining his friendship with Prince Forsyth. Winia Chester is an introverted and lonesome inn-maid, taken in and raised by her uncle out of pity after her parents died. She spends time with and becomes friends with Pacifica, and it is one of the few times she has smiled and laughed since her parents were killed. When Christopher kidnaps her and takes her to the Glass Canyon, Pacifica's identity as the Scrapped Princess is revealed to her. Although initially confused and unable to accept the fact that her new friend is \\"the poison that will destroy the world\\", Winia eventually comes around, and continues to have a close friendship with Pacifica. In the Glass Canyon, she discovers that her kidnapper, Christopher, is also an orphan. After the brief kidnapping episode, she develops a deep attraction to Christopher. After Providence is 'destroyed' and mankind is freed, she is seen with Christopher, knitting some pink clothes in a carriage. Winia also ends up being good friends with the Casulls. Leopold Scorpus is a clumsy but well-meaning traveling lordling who wishes to become a noble knight. He joins the Casull siblings after discovering them being \\"harassed\\" by a group of bandits. Utterly charmed by Pacifica, he vows to protect her and one day marry her. As the first son of Duke Scorpus and heir to his father's territory, he begins as an idealistic youth seeking to join the order of Amber Knights. After meeting the retired legendary knight Doyle Barrett, he begins to question the meaning of justice and chivalry, setting his quest to knighthood in second priority until he can finally discover for himself what chivalry truly is. He constantly carries a stuffed dragon costume with him, a gift from the baker he worked for in the city of Taurus. The headband he wears was a bandage that Pacifica made for him when he hurt himself trying to keep up with their wagon. Leopold talks often with Winia over their mutual friend Pacifica. After mankind is freed, he continues to follow after Pacifica and proposes to her. After an exaggerated pause, she responds by slapping him saying she has better things to do, but is seen blushing as she turns away. Doyle Barrett A doctor in a secluded forest area, used to be the head of the Amber Knights. He defied orders to throw the newborn princess down a cliff and kill her, as he began to doubt the true meaning of justice and chivalry that would have him kill an innocent child. When he found out that Pacifica was that same baby, he made an atonement by helping Raquel to save her life. Kidaf Gillot the Silencer is a bard who tries his luck as a bounty hunter using his ability to command a group of poisonous BUGs with his instrument. His original intention was to use his BUGs to poison and kill Pacifica, but Raquel subdued him in order to collect the antidote from his cave. In awe of Raquel's devotion, Kidaf stopped going after the Scrapped Princess' bounty, and even agreed to help Pacifica find her siblings by sending his bugs to search for them. Much later in the series, he helped Pacifica (then known as Pamela) to get a job in a theater as one of the costumed players. He also helps Leopold and Winia get jobs there ‚Äì Leo as another player and Winia as the snacks-sales lady. Eventually, when Pacifica gets found out, Kidaf advises her group on escaping the city, and stays behind to inform Raquel about what is going on. Later still, he helps to resist the Peacemakers. Prince Forsyth/Forsis is the Crown Prince and biological twin brother of Pacifica. Unlike his father, the King, he has his people's welfare as top priority, and despises all unnecessary bloodshed meted to take out the Scrapped Princess. For this reason ‚Äì the other being his physical resemblance to his mother and Pacifica ‚Äì he is constantly at conflict with the King. When Baroness Bairach introduces Christopher Armalite to him as her adopted son, the two become close friends. Despite his polite nature and calm appearance, the Prince is highly observant, clever, and quickly figures out that Christopher is more than he appears. Prince Forsyth sees the choices he might have to make between Pacifica, the younger sister he never knew, and his people as a dilemma. This leads him to continually look for information on his sister to try to make an accurate decision. He refuses to allow Christopher to call him by any royal title. The Mauser Cardinal asks Forsyth to be an Envoy of God and think about the greater good of his people. Later, Forsyth arranges a meeting with Pacifica, to finally meet his twin. After a short and awkward conversation he embraces her and apologizes, then draws his sword and stabs her in the back. He then pulls the sword free and drives it into his own chest, to atone for killing his sister by dying with her. He is revived from death when Pacifica 'destroys' Providence. A comment by Christopher at the end of the last episode reveals that Forsyth will soon be crowned the new King. Bergen A priest of the Mauser Church known as \\"The Heretical Procurator\\". Even though he is a priest of Mauser, he is an easy-going person. He believes that both Mauser and Browning are unnecessary. But he also believes that people need to believe something, otherwise life would be tough. He thinks it is weird to crush something because it is not the thing you believe in and does not accept Church doings. Later we learn that he is also part of the Guardians like Raquel, Shannon, Leo and Winia. Later in the series he helps Raquel and the others. Princess Seness Giat \\"Beast\\" Princess of the Giat Empire, she is quite short-tempered, due to her harsh childhood, where people feared her, and she and Pacifica often argued after they met. She is a warrior princess skilled with her sword and magic, and manages to revive the giant floating fortress Skid used 5000 years ago in the Genesis Wars, with the help of the Dragoon, Natalie. Even though Seness is a skilled fighter and magic user, she is still just a little below Shannon's fighting ability and cannot beat him even if she uses her magic and swordsmanship together. This was proven in a fight between her and Shannon. She lasted longer against Shannon than Chris did and that Shannon was one of her few defeats. After the fight, Seness gained some respect for Shannon as a fighter and Raquel as a mage and tactician. Along with two followers, Ruce and Drake, she fights using Gigas, a dragon-like being that is somewhat similar to a Dragoon, but cannot take the form of a person. Another follower, Eirote, seems to be her second in command. She is in charge of most technical work, such as rebuilding the Gigas and maintaining the Skid. Eirote is much kinder and more soft-hearted then Seness and often soothes the Beast Princess's rough temper for others as well as occasionally keeping Seness in line. Carol Casull The mother of Shannon and Raquel and adoptive mother of Pacifica ‚Äì as well as a formidable sorceress. A stately-looking woman with red eyes and silver hair, she was a friend of Pacifica's biological mother, but the relationship seems to have soured. It was she who decided that the infant Pacifica would receive a name that many people would like. Carol plays a greater role in the novel series than in the anime. Yuhma Casull The father of Shannon and Raquel and adoptive father of Pacifica. He has tawny skinned and has his biological children's dark hair. He is a jovial man whose composure is difficult to break. Like Carol, Yuhma has a greater role on the novels. Fulle/Furet Fulle, eighteen years old, first appears after the spell Ginnungagap creates a destructive tidal wave. Pacifica, who was on a boat, washes up on an island with no memory of who she is. While she is staring at the ocean, Fulle is assessing the damage done to the city. Pacifica follows him home in hopes that she might run into someone who knows who she is. For the next couple of days, Pacifica, now named Pamela by Fulle for the time being, lives with Fulle enjoying what would be an everyday normal life. After some time, both Fulle and Pamela find out that her real name is Pacifica and that she is the Scrapped Princess. Fulle, who used to be in the army, takes it upon himself to protect her and helps her, Winia, and Leo escape the city. Fulle does not survive, as he stays behind to keep the soldiers from getting any closer to her. He is shot with numerous arrows and dies in the streets of the city. It is Shannon who finds his lifeless body. Not knowing who he is, Shannon wonders that \\"he must have been trying to go somewhere very important\\", while shutting Fulle's eyes. By the end of the series, Pacifica still carries a small wooden block given to her by Fulle, strapped to her hip, claiming it makes her feel protected. Dragoons/Dragons Biological weapons allegedly made by the Dark God and the humans to fight the Peacemakers; actually made to fight aliens, as were the Peacemakers later. They were created by technology and bound with a master to fight but their program does not naturally allow them to harm humans. They are referred to as Demons by the common people. According to Zefiris, there were originally 200 \\"production versions\\" of the Dragoons, but many malfunctioned and could not be used to fight the enemy. Only 26 of the original 200 remained, and those 26 needed to be paired with a human \\"D-Knight\\" in order to use their vast power. Use of much of their power needed to be approved by the human D-Knight. One of the most interesting powers Dragoons possess, along with being able to turn into a full dragon, is their ability to escape into \\"Phase Space\\", which appears to be another dimension. From the perspective of the inhabitants of Dustbin, it appears that the Dragoons and Peacemakers just disappear when they transition to Phase Space. Zefiris (Serial Number 26) A Dragoon, or powerful spiritual being, who is actually an AI (artificial intelligence) weapon created during the Genesis Wars to battle an alien race that attacked humans 5000 years ago. She was used as a last resort plan to protect the Providence Breaker from the Peacemakers and is the last remaining Dragoon in the world of Providence that is fully functioning. Solemn, calm and quiet, Zefiris first appears as a mysterious character who shows up whenever the Casulls are in trouble and often gives them helpful advice. Zefiris appears to be something like a cosmos guardian (Peacemaker) due to her strange abilities and unfazed demeanour. She takes Shannon as master and merges with him so he can become a D-Knight (D for Dragon or Dragoon) and combat the Peacemakers. Shannon bears a significant resemblance to Becknum Mauser, her old master who died so Zefiris could live. Zefiris places her mission to protect the Providence Breaker above all other things, including the lives of thousands of other humans. Still, she is often in a dilemma about whether to follow the plan that the humans devised 5000 years ago as a last resort to free themselves from the sealed world. Her questioning of the plan contrasts with the views of her counterpart Natalie, who even tries to brainwash Shannon with her powers. In the last episode, Zefiris returns with the Casulls to their family farm to live out her days with her new master. Natalie (Serial Number 14) A fellow Dragoon who knows Zefiris, and took part in the Genesis Wars but, unlike Zefiris, lost most of her powers. To survive, she inhabits an ancient battle-vehicle, the Skid, as part of her body. Due to Natalie's integration with the Skid, she is able to both help or hinder the people on board. In order to continue to survive, Natalie has continued to upgrade her systems, but her abilities are limited and incomplete. Her personality is also cold and unfeeling, like the Peacemakers. Natalie does not consider herself a Dragoon anymore, even though, technically, she is still a Dragoon. Once, when Zefiris remarked that her methods were too forceful; the Dragoons were in the sealed world of Providence to be the Providence Breaker's Guardians against the Peacemakers, and to help humans. Natalie replied, in a rather unconcerned manner, \\"I am no longer a Dragoon, but we Dragoons need not go out of our way to help those foolish humans.\\" Hinting that the humans were a class below them (the Peacemakers and the Dragoons). Later in the series, as Natalie is unable to fight as a Dragoon, she helps create Dragoon emulations, the Gigas, who are like the Dragoons and Peacemakers, but do not have independent AIs and seem operated entirely by their human pilots. Natalie no longer considers herself a Dragoon due to the damage she suffered in the Genesis Wars. Gloria (Serial Number 7) Another one of the few Dragoons who barely survived the Genesis Wars, due to the Peacemakers' betrayal. She is barely alive, and is unable to assume her true form of a Dragoon. She first appeared as a giant frog (using frog DNA to give herself physical form). She chased a terrified Pacifica around the lake until Zefiris dispersed her physical form, revealing a semi-transparent girl that was her humanoid form. After Pacifica followed Zefiris' request to tell Gloria to rest, Gloria thanked her and disappeared for good. Peacemakers Cin A young girl whom Shannon finds outside a town. She claims to have no parents, and said she was waiting for somebody, though she did not know who it was. She follows Shannon home. After a few strange occurrences involving her, Zefiris informs Pacifica that Cin is a Peacemaker in a compressed state (the human girl form) and, on top of that, an artillery type that can cancel out the Dragoons' presence. As if to prove this, as soon as Zefiris says that, Pacifica sees Zefiris disappearing, just as Cin walks into the room. As artillery types were powerful and dangerous, Cz was compressed as Cin to keep them in a more stable condition. Galil, it turns out, was supposed to pick Cz up at the bridge and release her true form, but was eliminated by Zefiris before he could. Steyr went in his place to seek Cin out, finding her with Pacifica and finally \\"unzipping\\" her compressed form, causing her to revert to Cz, the Peacemaker. There was, in fact, some foreshadowing about Cz's true identity. In episode 8, when Shannon said that she might be killed if she stayed with them, she replied \\"I don't die.\\" (which is in fact true as Peacemakers are immortal). Also, she mentioned that she had no parents when Raquel inquired about it, not that they died or she got lost, but that she simply did not have parents. In addition, when Pacifica tried to catch up with her in the woods, Pacifica was nearly out of breath while she was not even panting. In her human form of Cin, she has difficulty using proper grammar and verb tenses, showing that she is still maturing. As Cz, she is cold and calculating, not caring if she is to die as long as she can take her enemies with her to death. In last episode she manages to say \\"I'm sorry\\" using her Cin form voice to Shannon. Cz A Peacemaker, or human-shaped weapon programmed to destroy the Scrapped Princess. She wore one of a pair of earring charms which Pacifica gave her when she was Cin, which she continues to wear even after reverting to her Peacemaker form. Later in the show, possibly because of her time as Cin, Cz's mentality is affected and she begins to sympathize with the humans, and later shows some reluctance to go on a mass killing spree. This seems to develop largely from her assignment to follow Shannon (in case he should find Pacifica), as she learns of his motivations and philosophy even while stating she does not care about them. (Note also in episode 18, the two share an umbrella in a scene that mirrors Shannon and Cin's first meeting). Cz is an artillery type cosmos guardian. She appears to look like an attractive woman with long dark hair, but wears an outfit that looks rather different from the humans and is similar to what Steyr wears. Destroyed in last episode when she purposely drops her defenses taking a shot in the head from D-Knight Shannon. Steyr http://gph.sakura.ne.jp/va_memo/system/vadb.cgi?action=view_title&value;=%A5%B9%A5%AF%A5%E9%A5%C3%A5%D7%A5%C9%A1%A6%A5%D7%A5%EA%A5%F3%A5%BB%A5%B9&mvalue;=%A5%DC%A5%F3%A5%BA&hvalue;=TV A fellow Peacemaker like Cz, who comes to retrieve Cin who she claims is Cz in compressed form. She proves this by using her powers to revert Cin into what looks like an adult version of Cin. She does not care how the other Peacemakers feel because their feelings do not really matter. She was in charge of the first attack on the Skid but was injured by Shannon and saved by Cz or else she would have been killed. Of the Peacemakers, Steyr despises humans the most, angered at the 5000 years of \\"humans killing humans\\" she has seen. However, she is unaware that the Peacemakers, including her, are Valkyrie Types ‚Äì an upgraded version of a Dragoon, and that she was created by humans, but got brainwashed into working for the enemy. Steyr's name is also mentioned as Stella. In her normal humanoid form, Steyr looks like a beautiful human woman with long pale blonde hair. Unlike Cz, Steyr is a civilian type cosmos guardian. Almost succeeds in killing Shannon in his full D-Knight form, but is destroyed when she is speared through the head by all three Gigas' light lances. Galil Another Peacemaker, and also a civilian type like Steyr. He was killed by Zefiris earlier in the series. Strangely, he does not seem to be very strong, as Zefiris did not have to transform into her true form to destroy him, and she killed him when she was getting decompressed. It may be because Galil was unaware of her ability, and got caught off guard (Zefiris had actually provoked him, which probably led to his blind attack.) Not much is said about his personality, but according to Zefiris he is arrogant and looks down to others people thinking that he is much superior above anyone else. Like all civilian types, he also has blonde hair. He was originally Cz's partner, as the Peacemakers operate in pairs, and was intended to retrieve Cz and decompress her ‚Äì his death complicates Cz's decompression and forces Steyr to take over. Socom An artillery type Peacemaker, like Cz. He appears later in the series. His personality is like Steyr's, but not as sadistic. He is also not as overly determined to get chances to kill people ( In an episode, while waiting for Pacifica to reach Leinwan, Steyr suggested to start killing people, but Socom, coming in the middle of the conversation between Steyr and Cz on who seems more human, said that there was no need to play petty tricks.). Nevertheless, he hates humans, or at least feels no particular desire to protect them. He is Steyr's partner. Destroyed in the last episode by the three Gigas when they use their light lances to slice him into three sections. Gods Celia/Seria Mauser Celia is actually the Lord Mauser. 5000 years ago, she was a seer in the Genesis Wars, and could read the enemies' movements with great accuracy. With the combined powers of the Peacemakers (also known as the Valkyrie Type) and the Dragoons, humans were a formidable foe. However, in an effort to stop the war and so prevent her brother (a D-knight like Shannon - Zefiris was his Dragoon) and sister from dying Celia betrayed the humans. The effort was in vain though, as both of them died before the war ended. Celia's betrayal led to the brainwashing of the Peacemakers and humanity being sealed in the world called Providence. Celia has maintained her appearance from 5000 years ago in an artificial body. The Peacemakers obey her, and they do not know that she was actually a human woman. It is quite ironic, as the Peacemakers (except for Cz) view humans with contempt as foolish beings who just cause trouble. Celia looks almost exactly like Pacifica, except for having lighter hair and a more matured look. Her siblings also look like Shannon and Raquel (except that Celia is their older sister, instead of younger). This is explained on board the Skiv, when Seness reveals that genetic engineering was used to ensure that the Providence Breaker gene (inherited by Pacifica) and Guardian genes (inherited by Raquel and Shannon, among others) would propagate throughout the captive humans. At the end, when Celia asks Pacifica whether it was right for the humans to be sealed, Pacifica said that people should be set free. Celia then smiles, and before disappearing in the end, says that she is glad that she is finally free to join her dead siblings. One theory for the notable resemblance between Pacifica and Celia is that Browning had intentionally used Celia's DNA as the DNA for the Providence Breaker, which would explain why the Peacemakers cannot attack her, as Celia and Pacifica are practically the same person. Lord George Browning 5000 years ago, he led 26 Dragoons, with their D-knights against the alien force ‚Äì and later the Peacemakers ‚Äì in an effort to defend humanity. In the 5000 years after the fall and sealing of humanity in Providence, he became a legend; just as Celia/Sillia became Lord Mauser, and the Peacemakers her Apostles, Lord Browning became known as the \\"Devil\\", while the faithful Dragoons were referred to as his \\"Demon servants\\", despite the fact that he is very much as human as Celia. It was said at first that he tried to wreak havoc on the world, but the Peacemakers and the Lord Mauser apparently defeated him. However, the truth was that the two of them were the most important people who helped defend the human race during the Genesis Wars, until Celia betrayed them and caused the Peacemakers to get brainwashed. Browning was the one who first proposed giving Celia her power. Other Pacifica Casull wearing the Mr. Soopy costume Mr. Soopy/Soopy- kun A dragon mascot used to market bread, buns and cakes by a baker. Originally, Pacifica wears the costume as a part-time advertising job but then gives the job to Leopold. Leopold is allowed to keep the costume as a reward for helping to sell the bread and then often uses the costume as pajamas. At one point, Leopold uses his Mr. Soopy costume to play the part of a dragon, while Pacifica (then known as Pamela) plays the part of the valiant knight and his horse (the design strikingly similar to Leopold and his horse Parabellum). Raquel seems to have an almost obsessive liking for Mr. Soopy, and once conjured up many little Mr. Soopies to help Pacifica prepare dinner. Dragunov The one of Casull's two brown horses that receives more limelight, placed on the right when pulling the wagon. While Leopold was making conversation with Pacifica during their first meeting while traveling, Parabellum was staring at Dragunov as they walked, drawing a parallel to their masters. As she pulled the carriage ahead of Parabellum to get away from him, Parabellum continually sped up to match her pace, ending with all three horses running at full speed and Leopold getting a branch to the face. When Shannon left to rescue Winia, he took Dragunov with him. Later, after meeting Cin, the Casulls had no choice but to sell Dragunov and the wagon for money to make ends meet. Later, while fleeing soldiers, Leopold and Fulle picked up Dragunov and Parabellum (coincidentally kept in neighboring stalls) from the stable of \\"confiscated\\" horses in the city (we do not know it is Dragunov until Raquel, and then Pacifica, recognizes the horse). In the epilogue, Dragunov goes into labor. Makarov One of the Casull's two brown horses, placed on the left when pulling the wagon. After Shannon successfully sold the wagon and Dragunov, Makarov was left to help them carry their supplies. After bumping into Seness and her troops, Makarov was placed in their safekeeping. The horse was eventually reunited with the Casulls after their successful escape from the capital. Parabellum Leopold Scorpus' white stallion. While Leopold was taking an interest in Pacifica, Parabellum was taking an interest in Dragunov. However she did not reciprocate and tried to walk ahead of him. However Parabellum kept trying to match her pace and all three horses ending up running at full speed. Later, as Leopold and Winia were helping Fulle to hide Pacifica, Parabellum was confiscated by the Army. Before making their escape, Leopold and Fulle went back into town to pick out two horses to help them get away; Leopold immediately picked out Parabellum by whistling to him. Fulle then took the horse next to Parabellum (Dragunov, coincidentally enough). There is a likely chance that Parabellum sired Dragunov's offspring, seeing that Dragunov goes into labor in the epilogue. Glossary Dragoon Artificial intelligence weapon systems that were originally created to be used as combat weapons against an alien race by then-technologically superior humans. As a last resort, they were programmed to assist and protect the Providence Breaker (Scrapped Princess). Their strength and abilities are roughly equivalent to the Peacemakers but are used to attack the Providence system instead of protecting it. These weapon systems appear to have been around since the Genesis War as they mention they have been hiding from the Peacemakers (sleeping is the term used) for 5,000 years prior to the Providence Breaker's arrival. The Dragoons and the Peacemakers are very alike in personalities, looks and abilities. 5,000 years later, they were said to be the demons of Lord Browning, just like how Celia Mauser became Lord Mauser and the Peacemakers her apostles, when in reality both the Dragoons and Peacemakers are AIs created by the technologically superior humans of 5,000 years ago. The Dragoons are ageless, and physical environments (in water, a vacuum etc.) do not affect them. They are able to levitate, go into the minds of humans, and teleport. When the Dragoons were first created, over 100 of them caused problems due to improper programming, which led to humans labeling them as troublemakers, and very few people trusted them. The Dragoons are also outwardly cold and unfeeling for humans, as they, like the Peacemakers, also comment on humans as being foolish, greedy creatures (in one episode, Natalie merely said that it could not be helped if 40,000 people were to get killed), only to be used as tools to complete their mission. The Dragoons, like their Peacemakers counterparts, do not feel many human emotions, such as fear and sadness, or see anything wrong in sacrificing many humans to protect the Providence Breaker. To them, as long as Pacifica manages to reach her 16th birthday, they will do anything at all costs to ensure it, just as the Peacemakers will do anything to stop Pacifica and the Dragoons from breaking the framework of the sealed world of Providence. However, some - like Zefiris - are different. She has more feelings, unlike the other Dragoons, who are cold and emotionless, and is often put into a moral dilemma on the methods, and wonders if they are too cruel and are sacrificing too many humans to achieve the goal of breaking the framework of the world of Providence. The Dragoons also have a true form, like the Peacemakers. In their true forms, the Dragoons turn into a large, powerful dragon. The Dragoons that have appeared in the series are Zefiris, Gloria and Natalie. There is a mythological depiction of the Genesis Wars on the wall in the Mauser church, where by which beings holding spears were seen descending from the skies onto what appears to be dragons. It actually depicts the brainwashed Peacemakers and the aliens fighting in the war against Mankind and their Dragoons. Genesis War Occurred 5000 years ago where humanity was in a massive war with alien intelligent life-forms. Instead of completely eliminating all of humanity, the aliens contact a human woman who betrays humanity in a desperate attempt to save her loved ones. This betrayal confines humanity to a contained world known as Dust Bin. It is not known whether there are humans that survived the Genesis War outside of the sealed world. Guardian Human beings with select genetic traits whereby they are able to draw on greater power to protect the Scrapped Princess, Pacifica (Providence Breaker). Several characters in the series possess this trait, including Shannon, Raquel, Leopold and Winia. Mauser Faith The predominant religion of the Scrapped Princess world. Used by Providence to maintain control of humanity as they believe the controlled world's system is the will of God. Lord Mauser (real name Celia Mauser) is in actuality the seer who betrayed humanity during the Genesis Wars and sealed them in this closed world to prevent the extinction of humanity. She did so in a desperate attempt to save her brother and sister but was too late as they both perished. Now, she runs the system and controls the fate of humanity. Celia's body and soul was maintained for 5000 years so she could run the system and give the Grendel Prophecies. Peacemakers/Cosmos Guardians A group of beings that have formidable powers and are supposedly the caretakers of the world. To the present humans, they were mainly known as cosmos guardians (or the Gods of the world). However, the Peacemakers are usually cruel, and have no qualms about killing humans. As Shannon said once to Cz: \\"You look like humans, walk and behave like humans, but you say cruel things which no human beings would ever say\\". They exist to maintain the Providence System at any cost. The Peacemakers outward appearance is that of attractive-looking humans, but their personalities are usually sadistic. Their abilities are similar to the Dragoons, and they are ageless. Their predominant role is that of ceasing Pacifica's life, though they are unable to attack her directly, as that would cause Pacifica's latent ability of being able to destroy the Peacemakers to manifest itself. It is also mentioned that humans cannot oppose the wills of the Peacemakers/Cosmos Guardians, and that Pacifica is the only exception, as she is able to go against their wills. The series also says that the Peacemakers operate in pairs. However, Cz, after experiencing many different events in her human form as a child, begins to sympathize with Pacifica and other humans, and to doubt her role as a cosmos guardian, wondering if what they, as the Peacemakers, are doing is right. Although she threatens to kill thousands of people per day at one point in the series, later on, she is accused/goaded by Steyr, another Peacemaker of having been \\"softened by the humans\\". Steyr goes on to taunt Cz by telling her that she \\"might as well go and live among them\\". The Peacemakers consist of civilian type and artillery type cosmos guardians, with the artillery types being the stronger of the two in terms of offensive power. Civilian types tend to prefer using manipulation and subterfuge to achieve their aims. Originally, the Peacemakers, like the Dragoons, were created by humans as combat weapons, but were captured and reprogrammed by the aliens. The Peacemakers are actually Valkyrie Type: they are basically Dragoons, only they are independent systems‚Äîwhich backfired as that made it possible for the aliens to reprogram them, unlike the Dragoons who needed a D-knight to access such capabilities. However, Zefiris and Natalie are usually able to hold off the Peacemakers' attacks. The Peacemakers' most common attack is their 2nd Class Divine Punishment, where they transform into a larger form. They are however, not allowed to use their strongest attack: 1st Class Divine Punishment Manifestation, within the atmosphere for fear of damaging the controlled world of Providence. However, the Peacemakers do use it in episode 24 when the Dragoons and the Peacemakers are evacuated out of the controlled world into space during the final battle, just before Pacifica turns 16. The known Peacemakers are Steyr, Shiizu/Cz (both are 'female' Peacemakers), Socom and Galil (Their male counterparts). Phase Space Apparently a pocket dimension that Dragoons and Peacemakers can escape to using some type of advanced technology. In episode 12 of the anime, Zefiris and Shannon escape to Phase Space after being overpowered by a powerful Peacemaker (Steyr/Stella). There are also times where the Dragoons and Peacemakers mention that they existed in Phase Space and were contained there. Providence Breaker The system that will terminate the controlled world and, in theory, free humanity from their unknowing prison. Also known as the Scrapped Princess. The Providence Breaker is also the only human who can defy the wills of the Cosmos Guardians. She can also destroy the proxies used to attack humans that are created by the Peacemakers. Providence The controlled world in which humans live and also the system which maintains it. The series suggests that humans are born with genetic information that allows the Peacemaker system and Providence rules to control them completely, thereby making any attempt to escape it impossible without the Scrapped Princess. Dustvin The continent on which humanity is contained is called \\"Dustvin\\", from the old language word for \\"garbage can\\" (\\"dust bin\\"). The old language is shown to be English. Rally Point/Proxy Typically referred to in the series as an amorphous creature that is made by Peacemakers out of organic matter (typically humans). The creature can absorb other living beings and add to its structure. The heart of the Rally Point is a blue energy-like crystal that controls it. There is also discussion about how the Scrapped Princess can be used as a Rally Point to prevent the Peacemakers from taking over the minds of humans. This suggests that Rally Points are magic focal points that can be used for other purposes. Combat Weapon Combat weapons consist of two types. The older versions are the Dragoons. Their newer counterparts are the Valkyrie Type, also called the Peacemakers. However the Peacemakers were brainwashed by an alien species that attacked Earth, and now serve as the prison guards of the sealed world: Providence. They seek to eliminate Pacifica as she has the power to go against their wills and break the framework of the sealed world. Race of Evil The alien race who were humanity's enemy during the genesis war. Unwilling to cause the extinction of humanity, they instead contacted Celia Mauser and helped her to confine humanity to the sealed continent of Dust-Bin, which they regarded as a \\"wildlife preserve\\" for humanity, where humanity could survive without posing a future threat to their race.

It combines the Doom first-person shooter franchise with role-playing video game elements. The storyline incorporates many similar events of Doom 3, but involves different characters than those in the third game. The website for Doom RPG does state that the protagonist in Doom RPG is the same character from Doom, Doom II, and Doom 3. Gameplay The game retains many of the elements of Doom, and is shown in the first person like the original. It is also visually similar to the original Doom. However, the game is fundamentally different in that it is a turn-based role- playing game, rather than a shooter, with greater emphasis on the plot. Combat and movement are turn-based, allowing the player time to select their responses in combat. The player turns at 90 degree angles and moves space by space. It is very important to speak to the scientists and access computer terminals to attain vital information in order to progress through the game, similar to Doom 3. Many features of the original are retained, including the status bar face, sound effects and the majority of the weapons and monsters. Notably absent are the Chainsaw, Arachnotrons and Spider Mastermind. A difference from the original is that each monster is one of three levels of difficulty, and is colored to indicate this. The game also adds several new elements. New weapons include the fire axe and fire extinguisher which are useful in combat against certain enemies. The dogs from Wolfenstein 3D appear as a new enemy, known as Hellhounds. A dog collar-styled mind-control device allows the hellhounds to be captured as pets, which can then act as both a melee weapon and a shield. Plot The story occurs on a Martian Union Aerospace Corporation installation similar to Doom 3. The player is addressed to by NPCs in the game as Marine. The game is divided into section based on Sectors in the base. The sectors are Entrance, Junction, Sector 1 through Sector 7, and Reactor. The Junction is the staging area or main town for the game. Guerard was not on good terms with Jensen. Three weeks prior to the start of the game, Guerard asked Graff to perform a security audit on Jensen. Jensen failed the security audit and was dismissed for this security breach. Jensen suspected that Guerard was involved in his dismissal. During the same time, demons started to invade the installation, appearing out of nowhere. It is around this time that the game begins. Early on in the game, the Marine meets Dr. Jensen when he was accessing a computer terminal investigating his dismissal. During the exploration of first few sectors of the installation, the Marine receives help from Dr. Guerard in gaining access to various locked down areas. In Biological Research Facility, the Marine meets Dr. Nadira who quarantines his weapons claiming security measures. Dr. Nadira then commands his mind-controlled hellhounds to attack the Marine and disappears in the process. Eventually, Marine meets Jensen again. This time he is incarcerated in a prison cell. After freeing Jensen, he informs the Marine that Guerard and Nadira are into an evil scheme and directs the Marine to the next section of the installation. The next time the Marine meets Guerard and Nadira, it is known that Guerard was behind the invasion and has been attempting to open a portal to Hell in the Reactor Sector. Guerard promptly orders demons to attack the Marine and Nadira. Nadira dies and Guerard escapes. The Marine proceeds through the remaining two sectors, acquiring the BFG 9000 and the key to the Reactor sector. By then, a major invasion devastates the Junction. With the help of Kelvin and Jensen, the Marine gains access to the Reactor sector. Kelvin and Jensen both die in the process. In the Reactor sector, Guerard reveals himself as Kronos and transforms into demonic form. By this time, he has succeeded in opening the portal to Hell. After defeating Kronos, the Marine closes the portal by destroying the reactors powering it. The Cyberdemon slips through before the portal closes. The game ends with the defeat of the Cyberdemon. The Cyberdemon is likely to be Kronos' creation referred to by other NPCs. Development The game's engine was later used for another Fountainhead Entertainment title, Orcs & Elves, Orcs & Elves II, and was also followed by Wolfenstein RPG and Doom II RPG. Supported platforms Game was released for three platforms: * Java * Low-end BREW * High-end BREW Symbian OS never received a dedicated port of game. Reception The game received some awards including \\"2005 Mobile Game of the Year\\", \\"2005 Adventure/RPG of the Year\\", \\"Editor's Award\\", \\"Game of the Year\\", \\"Editor's Choice Award\\" and \\"Best Wireless Adventure Game\\".

Polling is most often used in terms of input/output (), and is also referred to as polled or software-driven . Description Polling is the process where the computer or controlling device waits for an external device to check for its readiness or state, often with low-level hardware. For example, when a printer is connected via a parallel port, the computer waits until the printer has received the next character. These processes can be as minute as only reading one bit. This is sometimes used synonymously with 'busy-wait' polling. In this situation, when an operation is required, the computer does nothing other than check the status of the device until it is ready, at which point the device is accessed. In other words, the computer waits until the device is ready. Polling also refers to the situation where a device is repeatedly checked for readiness, and if it is not, the computer returns to a different task. Although not as wasteful of CPU cycles as busy waiting, this is generally not as efficient as the alternative to polling, interrupt-driven . In a simple single-purpose system, even busy-wait is perfectly appropriate if no action is possible until the access, but more often than not this was traditionally a consequence of simple hardware or non- multitasking operating systems. Polling is often intimately involved with very low-level hardware. For example, polling a parallel printer port to check whether it is ready for another character involves examining as little as one bit of a byte. That bit represents, at the time of reading, whether a single wire in the printer cable is at low or high voltage. The instruction that reads this byte directly transfers the voltage state of eight real world wires to the eight circuits (flip flops) that make up one byte of a CPU register. Polling has the disadvantage that if there are too many devices to check, the time required to poll them can exceed the time available to service the I/O device.  Algorithm  Polling can be described in the following steps: Host actions: #The host repeatedly reads the busy bit of the controller until it becomes clear. #When clear, the host writes in the command register and writes a byte into the data-out register. #The host sets the command-ready bit (set to 1). Controller actions: #When the controller senses command-ready bit is set, it sets busy bit. #The controller reads the command register and since write bit is set, it performs necessary operations on the device. If the read bit is set to one instead of write bit, data from device is loaded into data- in register, which is further read by the host. #The controller clears the command-ready bit once everything is over, it clears error bit to show successful operation and reset busy bit (0).  Types  A polling cycle is the time in which each element is monitored once. The optimal polling cycle will vary according to several factors, including the desired speed of response and the overhead (e.g., processor time and bandwidth) of the polling. In roll call polling, the polling device or process queries each element on a list in a fixed sequence. Because it waits for a response from each element, a timing mechanism is necessary to prevent lock-ups caused by non-responding elements. Roll call polling can be inefficient if the overhead for the polling messages is high, there are numerous elements to be polled in each polling cycle and only a few elements are active. In hub polling, also referred to as token polling, each element polls the next element in some fixed sequence. This continues until the first element is reached, at which time the polling cycle starts all over again. Polling can be employed in various computing contexts in order to control the execution or transmission sequence of the elements involved. For example, in multitasking operating systems, polling can be used to allocate processor time and other resources to the various competing processes. In networks, polling is used to determine which nodes want to access the network. It is also used by routing protocols to retrieve routing information, as is the case with EGP (exterior gateway protocol). An alternative to polling is the use of interrupts, which are signals generated by devices or processes to indicate that they need attention, want to communicate, etc. Although polling can be very simple, in many situations (e.g., multitasking operating systems) it is more efficient to use interrupts because it can reduce processor usage and/or bandwidth consumption.  Poll message  A poll message is a control-acknowledgment message. In a multidrop line arrangement (a central computer and different terminals in which the terminals share a single communication line to and from the computer), the system uses a master/slave polling arrangement whereby the central computer sends message (called polling message) to a specific terminal on the outgoing line. All terminals listen to the outgoing line, but only the terminal that is polled replies by sending any information that it has ready for transmission on the incoming line. In star networks, which, in its simplest form, consists of one central switch, hub, or computer that acts as a conduit to transmit messages, polling is not required to avoid chaos on the lines, but it is often used to allow the master to acquire input in an orderly fashion. These poll messages differ from those of the multidrop lines case because there are no site addresses needed, and each terminal only receives those polls that are directed to it.

McTaggart was on the left of his party, and took up issues of unemployment and poor housing which affected his constituency. He also took a particular interest in international affairs, being a supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization and visiting Libya, North Korea and the Soviet Union. McTaggart died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 43. Early life McTaggart was born in Glasgow, his father also being called Robert.\\"Bob (Robert) McTaggart\\" in Andrew Roth, \\"Parliamentary Profiles L-R\\", Parliamentary Profiles Service Ltd, 1984, pp. 514‚Äì15. He attended St Constantine and St Bartholomew primary schools, followed by Holyrood Secondary School.\\"McTAGGART, Robert\\" entry in Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1983, Dod's Parliamentary Companion Ltd, 1983, p. 442. At the age of 16 he left school and was apprenticed to be marine plumber\\"Robert McTaggart\\" (obituary), The Times, 24 March 1989. at Govan Shipbuilders, and worked for five years in this job. From 1968 to 1972 he was a trigonometrical calculator for the shipbuilders, then becoming a Pipework planner. McTaggart joined the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union and was the EETPU shop steward at Govan from 1971 to 1977. Politics After joining the Labour Party in 1969, McTaggart held a series of posts within the local Labour Party organisation where he lived. He was successively chairman of the Partick East Labour Party branch, Secretary of Townhead Labour Party branch, and a member of Glasgow Kelvingrove Constituency Labour Party Executive Committee. In 1974 he was elected to Glasgow Corporation, serving for only one year before local government was reformed. He was elected to Glasgow District Council as a councillor for the Anderston ward in the 1977 local elections. As a member of the licensing committee in December 1979, he resisted suggestions that the committee watch Monty Python's Life of Brian to consider whether to ban it from city cinemas.John MacCalman, \\"Council ponders 'Python' film\\", Glasgow Herald, 5 December 1979, p. 3. Glasgow Central In preparation for the 1979 general election, McTaggart became Agent for Glasgow Central Constituency Labour Party. The campaign he organised won the seat, but McTaggart's friend Thomas McMillan, MP died from head injuries sustained when he fell from a bus in Parliament Square in April 1980.\\"Labour MP dies\\", The Times, 1 May 1980, p. 1.

McTaggart was selected as his successor on 3 June.\\"Labour chooses former agent to fight election\\", The Times, 4 June 1980, p. 3. He fought the by-election resulting from McMillan's death by concentrating on national issues and especially attacked unemployment.Ronald Faux, \\"Forceful contest for Glasgow Central\\", The Times, 16 June 1980, p. 4. The constituency was the smallest in Britain and had some of the worst economic problems, and when McTaggart won with a majority of 2,780 over the Scottish National Party on a low turnout, it was regarded as a poor result. McTaggart declared that \\"it was the result we were looking for\\".\\"Nationalists push the Tories into third place\\", The Times, 27 June 1980, p. 1. Parliamentary activity Making his maiden speech on 10 July 1980 in an opposition debate on industry, McTaggart attacked the Conservative government's economic policy, claiming that non-intervention \\"fanned the flames of unemployment in Glasgow\\" and had caused the loss of 300 jobs each day.Hansard, HC 5ser vol 988 cols 799-801. In November 1981 he supported an increased borrowing limit for British Shipbuilders, urging that it set up a fund to take on new apprentices.\\"BS improving its performance\\", The Times, 18 November 1981, p. 8.

Labour Party politics McTaggart was sponsored by his union, the EETPU, which paid ¬£600 to his Constituency Labour Party and 80% of his election expenses. The union leadership was strongly aligned with the right in internal Labour Party debates and its leader Frank Chapple supported Denis Healey in the Deputy Leadership election in 1981. When McTaggart voted for the left-wing candidate Tony Benn, his EETPU sponsorship was withdrawn. He appealed unsuccessfully against the decision. Initially a member of the Tribune Group,F. W. S. Craig (editor), \\"The Political Companion\\", No. 32 (Spring 1982), p. 78. he was one of the founding members of the Socialist Campaign Group in November 1982, and in the same month spoke at a Glasgow meeting called by supporters of the Militant tendency opposing the expulsions of the members of the editorial board of Militant newspaper. He supported the left-wing team of Eric Heffer for Leader and Michael Meacher for Deputy Leader in the Leadership election in 1983. McTaggart was one of a group of some 30 Labour left-wingers who mounted a demonstration on the floor of the House of Commons in November 1984 against the Government's reduction in benefits to the wives of strikers; the Speaker was forced to adjourn the sitting.Stuart Trotter, William Russell, \\"Chaos in Commons\\", Glasgow Herald, 22 November 1984, p. 1. International affairs Throughout his time in Parliament, McTaggart showed an interest in visiting foreign countries. He was a guest of the North Korean government in visiting the country in September 1980, and of the Palestine Liberation Organization in visiting Jordan, the West Bank and Lebanon in January and February 1981. He urged recognition of the PLO as the \\"legitimate representative\\" of Palestinian people and pledged support for Palestinian \\"inalienable rights\\" in April 1983. After visiting Libya in 1983, he was due to go to the Libyan People's Bureau in London on the day that WPC Yvonne Fletcher was shot in April 1984; his offer to help negotiate with the Libyans was declined by the police at the ensuing siege. He was part of a Labour Action for Peace delegation to Moscow earlier in 1984. Domestic issues Glasgow Central included the historic centre of the city and McTaggart lived in a council house near the city centre; it expanded south of the River Clyde in 1983 to include Hutchesontown, where there were many tower blocks in poor condition. McTaggart backed a bid from the New Gorbals Trust charity to buy and demolish the Hutchesontown E block in 1985.Bob Tomlinson, \\"Hutchie E: The Big Question of ¬£20m\\", Glasgow Evening Times, 27 September 1985, p. 24. He criticised the Scottish Office minister Michael Ancram for calling on local authorities to remove asbestos from buildings but refusing to give them the money to do so.Allan Laing, \\"Ancram 'passing buck' on asbestos\\", Glasgow Herald, 18 February 1985, p. 3. He was re-elected with a 17,253 majority in the 1987 general election, having achieved an 8.7% swing to Labour.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1987\\", Times Books, 1987, p. 119. McTaggart was chairman of the all-party Scottish Penal Affairs Committee, where he worked quietly for improvements in prison conditions. After a series of prison disturbances, including one at Perth jail where a prison officer was taken hostage for 17 hours, he pointed to poor morale among prison officers and urged improvements in the parole system which he claimed were at the root of the problem.Raymond Duncan, \\"Warning from MP as prison siege ends\\", Glasgow Herald, 3 May 1988. He raised cases of alleged mistreatment of prisoners, and called for model prisoners to be released early. Sudden death In the deputy leadership election of 1988, McTaggart endorsed John Prescott rather than the further left Socialist Campaign Group candidate Eric Heffer.Ian Hernon, \\"Dewar in split on leadership fight\\", Evening Times, 5 September 1988, p. 4. Owing to rule changes in the Labour Party requiring that a woman be shortlisted for every Parliamentary selection, he expected to be challenged for reselection by Ann Henderson, an NUR delegate who was associated with a left-wing group who had removed most of his supporters from offices within the Glasgow Central Constituency Labour Party.William Clark, \\"Women likely to put in challenge for two 'safe' Labour seats\\", Glasgow Herald, 9 February 1989, p. 2. On 23 March 1989 McTaggart collapsed and died while on a London Underground train to Heathrow.Nicholas Wood, \\"Death opens way for SNP\\", The Times, 24 March 1989. It was confirmed that he had had a heart attack.Michael Jeffries, \\"A bigger role for the ambulance\\", The Times, 30 March 1989.

The two took refuge in the city during the Abbasid persecution of Shia Muslims. ShƒÅh-√©-Ch√©rƒÅgh is Persian for \\"King of the Light\\".  Overview  The tombs became celebrated pilgrimage centres in the 14th century when Queen Tashi Khatun erected a mosque and theological school in the vicinity. The site was given this name due to the nature of the discovery of the site by Ayatullah DastghƒÅ'ib (the great grandfather of the contemporary Ayatullah DastghƒÅ'ib). He used to see light from a distance and decided to investigate the source. He found that the light was being emitted by a grave within a graveyard. The grave that emitted the light was excavated, and a body wearing an armor was discovered. The body was wearing a ring saying al-‚ÄòIzzatu LillƒÅh, Ahmad bin M≈´sƒÅ, meaning \\"The Pride belongs to God, Ahmad son of Musa\\". Thus it became known that this was the burial site of the sons of M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅdhim.  History  The site is the most important place of pilgrimage within the city of Shiraz. Ahmad came to Shiraz at the beginning of the third Islamic century (approximately 900 AD), and died there. During the rule of Atabeg Ab≈´ Sa'id Zangi (~1130s AD) of the Zengid dynasty, the chief minister to the monarch by the name of Amir Muqarrab al-din Badr al-din built the tomb chamber, the dome, as well as a colonnaded porch. The mosque remained this way for roughly 200 years before further work was initiated by Queen Tash KhƒÅt≈´n (the mother of ShƒÅh Ab≈´ IshƒÅq Inj≈´) during the years 1344-1349 (745-750 AH). She carried out essential repairs, constructed an edifice, a hall of audience, a fine college, and a tomb for herself on the south side. She also presented a unique Qur'an of thirty volumes, written in golden thuluth characters with gold decoration, in the style of the calligraphist of that period, Yahya Jamali. The date written on the Qur'an indicates that they were written from 1344-1345 (754-746 AH). Nothing now remains of the buildings set up by Queen Tash KhƒÅt≈´n, but the Qur'ans have remained and are preserved in the Pars Museum. The mosque again underwent necessary repairs in 1506 (912 AH - under the reign of ShƒÅh IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´l I), which were initiated by the guardian of the mosque at the time, Mirza Habibullah Sharifi. The mosque was again repaired in 1588 (997 AH) when half of the structure collapsed as a result of an earthquake. During the nineteenth century, the mosque was damaged several times and was subsequently repaired. In 1827 (1243 AH), Fat'h ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ShƒÅh QƒÅjƒÅr presented an ornamental railing for the tomb. Another earthquake shook the mosque in 1852 (1269 AH), and repairs were carried out by Muhammad Nasir Zahir ad-Dawla. Finally, the late Nasirol'molk repaired the dome, but on account of the numerous cracks, in 1958 the whole dome was removed, and in its place an iron structure, which was lighter, and likely to last longer, in the shape of the original dome, was made at the cost of the people of Shiraz. The present building consists of the original portico, with its ten columns, on the eastern side, a spacious sanctuary with lofty alcoves on four sides, a mosque on the western side of the sanctuary, and various rooms. There are also numerous tombs contiguous to the Mausoleum. The decorative work in a mosaic of mirror glass, the inscriptions in stucco, the ornamentation, the doors covered with panels of silver, the portico, and the wide courtyard are most attractive. The tomb, with its latticed railing, is in an alcove between the space beneath the dome and the mosque. And this custom of placing the tomb in this position, so that it is not directly under the dome, is to be seen in other famous places of pilgrimage in the city of Shiraz, and may be considered a special feature of Shiraz shrines. Two short minarets, situated at each end of the columned portico, add impressiveness to the Mausoleum, and to the spacious courtyard, which surrounds it on three sides. The Shah-e-Cheragh Mausoleum was registered on 10 February 1940, under No. 363 in the list of the national monuments of Iran. Rated by many travellers as the most beautiful mosque in the world. The shrine was popularised in the West when in October 1976, Interview magazine published a Firooz Zahedi photo shoot of Elizabeth Taylor as a cover story.  Sayyid AlƒÅ al-Dƒ´n Husayn  Another important pilgrimage centre in the historical city of Shiraz is the mausoleum of Sayyid Husayn, another son of M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅdhim. This mausoleum is located near the south-east corner of Shiraz. The mausoleum itself is a tall building bearing a lofty dome. The original entrance was on the south side, approached by a small courtyard from the road that runs beside it. On the western side there is an area, more or less spacious, which was formerly a cemetery, but is now regarded as the western courtyard of the mausoleum. The mausoleum's interior consists of a tall sanctuary ornamented with designs in facets of mirror beneath the dome, and the tomb, as in the other places of pilgrimage in Shiraz, is situated in an alcove on the northern side, and there is a mosque adjacent to the sanctuary behind the railing of the tomb. The original building of the mausoleum was constructed by Qotlogh Khan, who in the Ilkhanate and Timurid period, at the close of the fourteenth, or at the beginning of the fifteenth century, was Governor of Shiraz, and had a garden where the present mausoleum stands, which was built over the site where the grave appeared to be. There is an inscription in Sols (Thuluth) script above the sanctuary, dated 943 A.H. (1563 AD), the writer of which was called Seyavash. The present Shrine was built in 923 A.H. (1517 AD). The Soltan Khalil mentioned is Soltan Zu'l-qadr who during the reign of the Safavid Shah Isma'il I was for fifteen years, from 911 to 926 A.H. (1505-1519 AD), Governor of Fars, and who according to what is written in the Naseri Fars-Nameh, on account of misconduct at the battle of Chalderan, was by order of Shah Ismail put to death in 926 A.H. The year 943 A.H., mentioned at the end of the inscription above the sanctuary (below the dome), indicates that in the time of Shah Tahmasb I the work of completing the mausoleum was accomplished. On account of the instability of the soil, and the earthquakes that occurred in Shiraz, this building suffered considerable damage, and a part of the dome, which had last been repaired by the late Mirza Abu'l-Hasan Moshiro'l-molk, gave way, and was threatened with collapse, and in spite of repairs, and much reinforcement, which was carried out by the late General Riazi, the former Director of Education in Fars, and subsequently, the threat of dissolution increased daily, until in the year 1950 the dome was taken down by the Fars Department of Education. Then a dome of less weight, with an interior iron structure, was prepared, at the cost of the funds of the mausoleum, and it was placed in position in 1952, and during several succeeding years a covering of brick and enamelled tiling was applied in the shape of the original dome. The Mausoleum of Sayyid Husayn was registered on 20 December 1937, under No, 307 in the list of the historical monuments of Iran  Gallery  File:ShahCheraghShinyDome.jpg|Extensive mirror-work under the domes.

History The club was founded in 1913 and its history is confused with the history of many other clubs created in the early years of the twentieth century. According to Antonio Miguez, one of the founders of Rio Branco, in an interview with journalist Oscar Gomes Filho, author of the most important work ever published on a soccer club in Esp√≠rito Santo - Rio Branco Atl√©tico Clube - Stories and Conquests (1913-1987), The story of Rio Branco begins in May 1913. From the \\"peeled\\" and \\"cracks\\" in fields of discovered areas, the boys of Sul Am√©rica and the XV de Novembro (teams linked to traditional teaching institutions of the Season, State College and Normal School) already had fun with football and the two other teams were already thinking about competitions, Rui Barbosa (who had a short life) and the Victoria Foot-Ball Club, founded by rich white boys. But the poor also liked \\"gusts.\\" Among them, Jos√© Batista Pav√£o and Ant√¥nio Miguez, until then clerks in a hardware store. The two, in one of the many conversations about soccer, together with Edmundo Martins, also a clerk, decided to found a team. On the second Sunday of June they held a new meeting and brought several guests. The first to accept the invitation was Nestor Ferreira Lima, who despite studying at the State College, did not play in Sul Am√©rica. The boys present, all between 14 and 16 years old, exchanged ideas and discussed everything from the English ball to the caps. New meeting was scheduled, this time for the founding of the club. The meeting was scheduled for June 21, 1913 and guests should bring a name suggestion to the new club. On that day, everyone presented with their best clothes. The suggestions of names were varied, from names of personalities of the history of Brazil and commemorative dates. Also several suggestions of names of Portuguese heroes, but the most popular already gave names to clubs existing in Vit√≥ria (Saldanha of Gama and √Ålvares Cabral). The alternatives became scarcer, when one of the young people, whom Ant√¥nio Miguez does not remember, suggested a tribute to the young people who idealized him, young and vigorous. The \\"Juventude e Vigor\\" was born. The important meeting took place at Nestor Ferreira Filho's house, more precisely in a room furnished by his father, next to his accounting office. The founders have entered into the history of the club: Edmundo Martins, Ant√¥nio Miguez, Gerv√°zio Pimentel, Jos√© Fiel, Jos√© Batista Pav√£o, Cl√°udio Daumas, Ot√°vio Alves de Ara√∫jo, Hermenegildo Conde, Adriano Macedo, Ant√¥nio Gon√ßalves de Souza and Nestor Ferreira Filho, who would be its first president. Shortly after its founding, some of its founders, invited by young people from 14 to 16 years old, did not feel well with the denomination, since they were not teenagers anymore and they remembered that the other founders also would not be them. During this period, Juventude e Vigor also 'matured', with the support of Rui Barbosa's players. The decision, at a meeting held on February 10, 1914, was swift and affirmed with reference to the events that marked the republican history of that time: to honor the Chancellor Jos√© Maria da Silva Paranhos J√∫nior, known as the Baron of Rio Branco. The name \\"Youth and Vigor\\" came out of the scene and the Rio Branco Football Club appeared. On March 8, 1941, Mr. Luiz Gabeira, who had been President in 1930, was elected as President of the club. Once the legal requirements to operate for a short time like Riobranquinho were restored, administrative normality was restored and the team was victorious, as was the case Since its foundation, the alvinegros leaders held a General Assembly on March 18, 1941, to deliberate on the creation of a new association. Having as motto the phrase \\"All for the benefit of Rio Branco\\", created the Rio Branco Atl√©tico Clube. From that moment, the club would have, in the shield, the acronym RBAC, of memorable conquests. Stadium Rio Branco play their home games at Est√°dio Kl√©ber Andrade. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 21,152 people. Rivalries The biggest rival is Desportiva Ferrovi√°ria, which both make the state's largest derby known as the Giants Classic. Another rival is Vit√≥ria Futebol Clube, with whom he has been doing the Vi-Rio classic since 1913.

Structure The cardiac plexus is divided into a superficial part, which lies in the concavity of the aortic arch, and a deep part, between the aortic arch and the trachea. The two parts are, however, closely connected. The sympathetic component of the cardiac plexus comes from cardiac nerves, which originate from the sympathetic trunk. The parasympathetic component of the cardiac plexus originates from the cardiac branches of the vagus nerve. Superficial part The superficial part of the cardiac plexus lies beneath the arch of the aorta, in front of the right pulmonary artery. It is formed by the superior cervical cardiac branch of the left sympathetic trunk and the inferior cardiac branch of the left vagus nerve. A small ganglion, the cardiac ganglion of Wrisberg, is occasionally found connected with these nerves at their point of junction. This ganglion, when present, is situated immediately beneath the arch of the aorta, on the right side of the ligamentum arteriosum. The superficial part of the cardiac plexus gives branches * (a) to the deep part of the plexus; * (b) to the anterior coronary plexus; and * (c) to the left anterior pulmonary plexus. Deep part The deep part of the cardiac plexus is situated in front of the bifurcation of the trachea (known as the carina), above the point of division of the pulmonary artery, and behind the aortic arch. It is formed by the cardiac nerves derived from the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic trunk, and the cardiac branches of the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The only cardiac nerves which do not enter into the formation of the deep part of the cardiac plexus are the superior cardiac nerve of the left sympathetic trunk, and the lower of the two superior cervical cardiac branches from the left vagus nerve, which pass to the superficial part of the plexus. Right half The branches from the right half of the deep part of the cardiac plexus pass, some in front of, and others behind, the right pulmonary artery; the former, the more numerous, transmit a few filaments to the anterior pulmonary plexus, and are then continued onward to form part of the anterior coronary plexus; those behind the pulmonary artery distribute a few filaments to the right atrium, and are then continued onward to form part of the posterior coronary plexus. Left half The left half of the deep part of the plexus is connected with the superficial part of the cardiac plexus, and gives filaments to the left atrium, and to the anterior pulmonary plexus, and is then continued to form the greater part of the posterior coronary plexus.

Forty years after the creation of Cergy-Pontoise, the village has retained its bucolic atmosphere and there has been little construction of large scale residential developments. In the 17th century, Charles de la Grange unites the villages of Ham (Cergy), the Sergentery of Neuville-sur-Oise and the Barony of Conflans. The Baron of Conflans, councillor to the king, Lord of Neuville and Ham built the castle of Neuville. In 1995 was opened the university of Cergy-Neuville on the site of an old cottage near the D203, a station was also built to serve both the village and the university. Public transport Since 1995, Neuville-sur-Oise was built the Neuville Universit√© station on the RER line A line.

He co-founded the Union and Merchants' banks and served as Mayor of Halifax. He was a Conservative senator from 1867 to 1876. Early life and business career Kenny was born in County Kerry, Ireland, the son of Jeremiah Kenny of Ballykeally, Esq., and Johanna Crean. He began working for James Lyons, a merchant with connections with Halifax, Nova Scotia, and moved to the city in 1824 where he worked as Assistant manager at James Lyons and Co.

Cogswell, Henry Pryor, John Tobin, Robert Morrow, Alfred G. Jones, M.B. Almon, Jr. and William Cunard. In May 1867, Kenny was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing senatorial division of Nova Scotia. A Conservative, he was Receiver General from July 1, 1867 to November 16, 1869 and President of the Privy Council from 1869 to 1870, when he was knighted. He resigned from the Senate April 11, 1876. He died in his home at 167 Pleasant St, Halifax, Nova Scotia on May 16, 1891.

It may be described in the US as the qualified (limited) First Amendment or statutory right many jurisdictions have given to journalists in protecting their confidential sources from discovery. The First, Second, Third, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits have all held that a qualified reporter's privilege exists. In the recent case of U.S. v. Sterling, the Fourth expressly denied a reporter's privilege exists under Branzburg. Furthermore, forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes called shield laws protecting journalists' anonymous sources. United States  Department of Justice guidelines (United States)  The United States Department of Justice created self-imposed guidelines intended to protect the news media by regulating the use of subpoenas against the press. These guidelines state that the government \\"should have made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources‚Äù before considering issuing a subpoena to a member of the news media.28 C.F.R. ¬ß 50.10(c)(4)(iii). Furthermore, the guidelines require that federal prosecutors negotiate with the press, explaining the specific needs of the case. Before any subpoena may be issued, the attorney general must approve the issuance. The attorney general‚Äôs review for a subpoena to a member of the news media shall be based on the following criteria: * In criminal cases, there should be reasonable grounds to believe, based on information obtained from non-media sources, that a crime has occurred, and that the information sought is essential to a successful investigation‚Äîparticularly with reference to directly establishing guilt or innocence. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information. * In civil cases there should be reasonable grounds, based on non-media sources, to believe that the information sought is essential to the successful completion of the litigation in a case of substantial importance. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information. * The government should have unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the information from alternative non-media sources. * The use of subpoenas to members of the news media should, except under exigent circumstances, be limited to the verification of published information and to such surrounding circumstances as relate to the accuracy of the published information. * Even subpoena authorization requests for publicly disclosed information should be treated with care to avoid claims of harassment. * Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely notice of the demand for documents. While these guidelines seem extremely protective of the press, they explicitly deny the creation of ‚Äúany right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law.‚Äù28 C.F.R. ¬ß 50.10(j). Nor does the policy have any substantive punishment for the federal government violations. If the federal prosecutors fail to obtain approval from the attorney general, the extent of the authorized punishment is ‚Äúan administrative reprimand or other appropriate disciplinary action.‚Äù28 C.F.R. ¬ß 50.10(i). In fact, some courts have found that the guidelines ‚Äúcreate no enforceable right.‚ÄùIn re: Miller, 397 F.3d 964, 975 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (The appellant journalists claimed that the contempt charges should be reversed because the justice department had not complied with the guidelines issuing subpoenas to news media. Because the circuit court found that the guidelines did not create an enforceable right, it found no reason to determine the issue of compliance). Therefore, in circuits taking this approach, the news media have no right to appeal for enforcement of these policies before being compelled to testify.  Judith Miller's attempted use of reporter's privilege  The issue of a reporter's privilege came to the forefront of media attention in the 2005 case In re Miller, involving reporters Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper. Miller and Cooper were both served with grand jury subpoenas for testimony and information, including notes and documents pertaining to conversations with specific and all other official sources relating the Plame affair. Both refused to submit to the subpoenas, claiming a reporter‚Äôs privilege.In re Miller, 397 F.3d 964, 966-68 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The federal district court held both Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the orders of contempt. Miller and Cooper, in their appeal to the appellate court pleaded several defenses including a First Amendment reporter‚Äôs privilege and a common law reporter‚Äôs privilege.Id. at 967. Miller and Cooper also put forward a due process defense and a defense based on guidelines for the Justice Department that are codified at 28 C.F.R. ¬ß 50.10 (2005). The appellate court rejected both the First Amendment and common law claims for privilege. The court held Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court and sentenced both to eighteen months of jail time. The sentence was stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Judith Miller began serving the remaining four months of the original eighteen-month sentence on July 6, 2005. Matthew Cooper‚Äôs confidential source released him from their confidentiality agreement, so he chose to comply with the subpoena and has agreed to testify before the grand jury.Adam Liptak and Maria Newman, New York Times Reporter Jailed for Keeping Source Secret, The New York Times, July 6, 2005.  Congressional proposals  In 2004, two significant bills were introduced in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate to create a federal shield law. The first bill was introduced in identical form in both the Senate and the House by Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Representative Mike Pence (R-IN).H.R. 581 (Free Flow of Information Act of 2005). This bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. See also S. 340 (Free Flow of Information Act of 2005) (referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary). Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) introduced separate legislation that created a seemingly broader protection than the Pence/Lugar bill.S. 369. Sen. Dodd introduced the same bill in the 2004 congressional session. It was not acted on before the Senate adjourned. See S. 3020, 108th Congress, 2nd Sess. (2004); see also Second shield bill introduced in U.S. Senate, http://www.rcfp.org/news/2005/0217-con-second.html. In 2006, Rodney A. Smolla testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the topic of reporter's privilege. On December 2, 2010, in a reaction to the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, John Ensign (R-NV) introduced S.4004 to amend section 798 of title 18, United States Code, to provide penalties for disclosure of classified information related to certain intelligence activities and for other purposes.

The Poker Club was created in 1762 out of the ashes of The Select Society. Adam Smith said, \\"Divided counsels and diminished zeal supply, no doubt, the main reason for the decay of the Poker Club,\\" but he also mentioned the rising costs to members. The Poker was the name given to the Militia Club at its third or fourth meeting. The Militia was formed in Edinburgh to promote the cause of establishing a militia in Scotland. It was thought that the formation of a democratic national force was essential to grace the dignity of the nation and the aim was to make up for the omission of that provision in the Militia Act of 1757 which applied only to England and the Scottish Militia Bill which was rejected in April 1760. The aim of the club provoked some unwelcome opposition and, at the suggestion of Adam Smith the name was changed so as to be enigmatic to the general public. Much as a fireplace poker stirs a fire to flame up, The Poker was to \\"stir up\\" the militia question. The club was said by Dr Carlyle to consist of all the literati of Edinburgh and its surroundings. The establishment was frugal and moderate, \\"as that for all clubs for a public purpose should be. The dinner was set soon after two o'clock, at one shilling a head, the wine to be confined to sherry and claret, and the reckoning to be called at six o‚Äôclock\\". The first fifteen members were chosen by nomination, the rest by ballot, \\"two black balls to exclude the candidate\\". A new \\"preses\\" (chairman) was chosen at each meeting.

David Hume could well find the company of The Poker a relief from a skeptical depression ‚Äì \\"Most fortunately it happens that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose ... I dine, I play a game of backgammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends; and when after three or four hours amusement, I return to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strain'd, and ridiculous, that I cannot find it in my heart to enter into them any farther.\\" See also * Edinburgh Cape Club References *, p. 312\\\\. quoted in ‚Äì *Daiches D., Jones P., Jones J.

It is located 13 miles northeast of Winterhaven, CA-Yuma, AZ on Imperial County route S24. Constructed between 1903 and 1905, the dam was the first dam built on the Colorado River and subsequently ended boat travel to the north. History After the passage of the Reclamation Act by the US Congress in 1902, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began constructing the dam under the Yuma Project in 1903. This project was the first development of the U.S. Reclamation Service along the Lower Colorado River and featured the Laguna Diversion Dam, a pumping station and a series of canals. On July 6, 1905 the contract to build the dam was awarded to J. G. White and Company who started construction less than two weeks later. Deliveries of cement were a problem as they had to be delivered to Yuma by rail and to the construction site by wagons or steamboat. Poor rock quality at local quarries also posed a problem that consistently delayed construction, 50% of the weak rock was unusable. Even after their contract was supplemented to encompass the rock quality delays, J. G. White and Company still did not meet their deadline and the Bureau of Reclamation took over construction in early 1907. To solve the cement delivery problems, the Bureau of Reclamation had built a levee on the California side on the dam that was topped by a rail-line by March 1908. Beforehand, they had also gained the cooperation of the Southern Pacific Railroad who agreed to deliver cement directly at the dam site. The rock problem was solved when the Bureau raised the upstream and downstream cofferdams with rock waste and topped them with rail lines that could deliver rock-fill much faster. By December 1908, the water bypass around the dam was complete and workers began to pour the rock-fill. Three large concrete walls supported by 6-inch sheet-wood pilings were built across the river for the dam's foundation. Rock-fill was placed in between and on the outsides of these walls for support. The California sluiceway consisted of three iron gates while the Arizona had one. Mexican-Americans mostly worked on the dam while a few Native American Indians did as well. Skilled white-labor worked in the cooler months. The Laguna Dam's design and size made it a peculiar structure for the time. The dam, a weir, was merely 43 ft. tall, almost two-thirds of which were built below the riverbed. Subsequently, the dam only raised the river ten feet. Modifications to the dam's downstream talus were done between 1923-1924. After the creation of the Imperial Dam 5-miles upstream, the Laguna Diversion Dam was no longer needed and its California diversion outlets were closed on June 23, 1948. Since then, the dam serves to regulate the outflows of the Imperial Dam and often does not impound a large reservoir. Swastika design The Laguna Dam was decorated with numerous swastikas, thus developing the eventual nickname \\"Swastika Dam.\\" The swastikas present on this structure were not put there for any sort of National Socialist (\\"Nazi\\"), or otherwise racist or socio-political reasons. They were placed there prior to Adolf Hitler's effectively having altered the popular meaning of the swastika within Western societies.

There was an annual science fair and a Shakespearian drama program. Students were active participants in the Model United Nations program, the Presidential Classroom program, and various other programs. Controversy ISA has been accused of promoting religious intolerance. On February 23, 2005, the day after Ahmed Omar Abu Ali was indicted on terrorism charges, New York Senator Charles Schumer issued a press release questioning whether the ISA was \\"another madrassa\\" (i.e. a school teaching radical Islamic theology. Madrassa is the Arabic word for school, but in America the term is often used incorrectly.) Senator Schumer sent letters to Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan and U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.senate.gov In October 2007, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom urged the US State Department to shut down ISA on the grounds it teaches religious intolerance. The Commission accused the ISA of promoting religious intolerance that could prove a danger to the United States. In response ISA officials stated that they had removed offensive passages from the books the previous summer, but did not explain why the Saudi embassy officials had refused to personally make the books available to the Commission. Officials of ISA criticized the USCIRF, saying that the panel unfairly damaged the school's reputation, and invited the commission members to review the books; an offer which was refused. According to the Commission chair he did not take up the academy's offer of making the book available because academy officials wanted mutually acceptable scholars and translators to review the textbooks. Washington Post article about ISA's response to USCIRF report from October 2007 Textbook passages In June 2008, another USCIRF report stated that textbooks at ISA teach students that it is permissible for Muslims to kill adulterers and converts from Islam, and also teach that, \\"The Jews conspired against Islam and its people.\\" ISA officials issued a press relate stating that the aforementioned textbooks are sorely outdated, and once again invited the USCIRF to visit its campus to review more recent materials. The rejection of such an offer it stated would lead the ISA to doubt the intentions of the investigation.ISA press release June 13, 2008 Land lease ISA's campus was leased from the Fairfax County government on a year-to-year lease, and the issue has occasionally been raised that perhaps Fairfax should not continue leasing the land if the ISA's textbooks do promote terrorism or intolerance. On June 23, 2008, Fairfax County's Board of Supervisors made a formal request to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to determine if Fairfax County should continue to lease the land.

Unlike many supervillains, Hammond does not use an alias. Peter Sarsgaard played the role of Hammond in the 2011 film Green Lantern. Publication history Hector Hammond originally appeared in Green Lantern (vol. 2) #5 (March‚ÄìApril 1961) and was created by John Broome and Gil Kane. Fictional character biography Hammond is a petty criminal on the run from the law when he discovers the fragments of a strange meteor in the woods (later retconned as part of the same meteor that lands in Africa, super-evolving Gorilla Grodd and the other gorillas of Gorilla City).Flash (vol. 2) #69 (October 1992) Observing that radiation from the meteor has caused the nearby plants to evolve rapidly, Hammond decides to kidnap four scientists and expose them to the meteor on a remote island. The radiation causes their intellects to evolve, but also has the side effect of sapping their wills. Hammond is able to force the scientists to use their heightened intellect to create amazing new inventions, which Hammond sells for his own profit. Hammond rapidly becomes a rich celebrity due to the wealth he has acquired. Green Lantern Hal Jordan asks his friend and mechanic, Thomas Kalmaku, to take on the role of the Green Lantern while Jordan investigates Hammond. Jordan creates a duplicate power ring and costume for Kalmaku to fool Hammond, and tells him to fly above Coast City so it would be thought Green Lantern was there. The scientists tried to use a device to bring this Green Lantern to them, but the ring was first pulled off his finger and fell on the island, where Hammond found it. Unaware of the impersonation, Hammond steals his ring and turns Kalmaku into a chimpanzee. Jordan confronts Hammond personally in a battle of power rings that ends only when the charge of Hammond's ring runs out, allowing Jordan to capture him and restore Kalmaku and the scientists. He removed the scientists' memory of their knowledge, and got rid of the inventions as well, feeling humanity should advance more steadily. Hammond returns in Justice League of America #14 (September 1962), where he has managed to escape from prison and deliberately exposes himself to the meteorite. The radiation causes his brain to grow to enormous size, granting him psionic powers as well as immortality in the process. He captures Green Lantern using a \\"de-memorizer\\" invented by Amos Fortune, but he is later captured. Unfortunately, his body becomes immobilized, and he loses the power to speak. Trapped in a motionless state, Hammond is still able to use his psionic powers to control the minds of others. He attempts to steal the Green Lantern's ring, but Jordan manages to command his ring to drain itself of power when it leaves his finger, after which Jordan renders Hammond unconscious.Green Lantern (vol. 2) #25 (December 1963) Hammond is responsible for the creation of the second Royal Flush Gang in Justice League of America #203 (June 1982). Hammond and the Gang are defeated when Dr. Martin Stein, one half of the superhero Firestorm, subdues Hammond on the astral plane. He was involved with erasing the world's memories of the JLA in Justice Leagues.Justice Leagues #1 (March 2001) In addition to battling Hal Jordan, Hammond has also fought Green Lanterns Alan ScottGreen Lantern Quarterly #2 (Fall 1992) and Kyle Rayner.Green Lantern 80-Page Giant #2 (June 1999) After Green Lantern: Rebirth Following the 2004-2005 miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth, in which Hal Jordan was resurrected, vindicated for his past crimes and returned as the star of the Green Lantern core series, Hammond reappeared as one of his adversaries. Recently, after his capture and further experimentation by the Kroloteans, the aliens who sent the meteor that gave him his powers, he seems to have recovered the ability to speak without using telepathy.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #4 (August 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #5 (November 2005)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #6 (December 2005) Hammond appears in Infinite Crisis: Villains United special, in which he is broken out of prison along with several other supervillains and was seen as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains. \\"Secret Origin\\" Hammond appears in the 2008 storyline Green Lantern: Secret Origin, a re-telling of Hal Jordan's first days as a Green Lantern. In that storyline, Hammond aspires to be Carol Ferris' boyfriend,Green Lantern (vol. 4) #30 (April 2008) feelings that are not reciprocated by Ferris, who merely went out to one dinner with him for business purposes, as he is a private consultant for Ferris Aircraft.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #31 (May 2008) While inspecting Abin Sur's crashed spacecraft, Hammond is affected by the meteorite fragment used as a power source in its reactor, which results in an increase in his brain size and telepathic abilities, with which he learns Jordan is a Green Lantern.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #32 (June 2008) He attempts to use his telepathy to keep Hal from using his ring, but is thwarted by Sinestro.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #33 (July 2008) It is revealed that Hammond wants the power of a god in order to gain revenge on Hal Jordan/Green Lantern.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #35 (October 2008) Brightest Day Hammond's telepathic thoughts are shown from Belle Reve Prison, stating \\"It has Parallax\\", after an unknown force pulled Parallax away.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #51 (February 2010) Afterwards, Krona helps Hammond get out of prison, to pursue the entity trapped inside Larfleeze's lantern. Hammond attacks Larfleeze and Hal Jordan, and during the fight manages to swallow Larfleeze's battery, allowing the entity, Ophidian, to possess his body just as Parallax possessed Hal's.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #56 (June 2010) The battle with Ophidian does not go very well for Hal or Larfleeze. While fleeing Ophidian, Larfleeze admits that he was not entirely honest about his ownership of the orange lantern and that he and Ophidian have a rather antagonistic relationship, however he is quick to blame Ophidian for starting whatever it was that came between them. Ophidian states that Larfleeze was the only being in the universe capable of resisting his temptations, thereby allowing Larfleeze to subdue him and become Agent Orange, and now it is Larfleeze's turn to be subdued and used by Ophidian, Ophidian then attempts to devour Larfleeze but he is saved by Hal. After that the desires of Hector begin to override those of Ophidian and he leaves to search for his ultimate desire: \\"Carol Ferris\\".Green Lantern (vol. 4) #57 (September 2010) Ophidian would later apparently reassert its hold on Hector as he was seen joining Krona, helped the renegade Guardian of the Universe discover the location of the Butcher with its disruptive powers and was last seen returning with Krona to Ryut where he began purging the universe of all emotionally unbalanced beings.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #62 (February 2011) Hector's fate afterwards remains unknown as the Orange Battery is seen in the Book of the Black which prompted Larfleeze to try to recover it only to be trapped himself in the Book and Ophidian is seen without its host, launching, along with the other entities and Krona, an attack on Oa, where it possessed a Guardian of the Universe.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #64 (March 2011) The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Hector Hammond first appears in Superman #18, seen comatose as a prisoner in S.T.A.R Labs, where he suddenly recovers the ability to dream.Superman Vol 3 #18 (May 2013) However, when Orion arrives in the lab looking for Superman, he detects Hammond to be brain dead and leaves.Superman Vol 3 #19 (June 2013) Hector Hammond is seen in an uneasy alliance with the H.I.V.E.Action Comics Vol. 2 #22 Hammond later plays an important role in the Superman: Psi War story arc. His comatose body is stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs by H.I.V.E. agents. The H.I.V.E. Queen's plan is to use his considerable mental powers to mentally enslave the world in preparation for Brainiac's return. However, by chance a live cable in his life support gets loose and electrocutes Hammond, awakening him from his medically induced coma. The near-electrocution also boosts his powers and he connects with the minds of every citizen in Metropolis, causing them to act strange and attracting Superman's attention. He then breaks into H.I.V.E.'s headquarters located beneath Metropolis and confronts the H.I.V.E. Queen. Once she makes it clear that it is not an alliance she is seeking, and that she merely sees him as a means to an end, he overpowers her and takes over her organisation. However she manages to escape and initiates an attack that takes over the entire city. Having found out her plan, Hector sends an astral projection to her location and engages the Queen in battle using the citizens of Metropolis as soldiers. Once she discovers Hammond is just a psionic avatar, she retreats back to her base, intent on retaking it. However, both Hector Hammond and the H.I.V.E. Queen are overpowered by the Psycho Pirate and have their powers drained. The Pirate then confronts and drains Superman only to be attacked by Lois Lane, who had been developing psychic powers of her own. Recovering, Hammond proposes a truce between the heroes and the Queen who had barely survived the Pirate's attack. The telepaths then fight the Psycho Pirate only to be beaten again. Once Roger Hayden is defeated, he, the H.I.V.E. Queen and Hector Hammond disappear in the aftermath. During the Forever Evil storyline, Hector Hammond is among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.Forever Evil #1 In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Hector Hammond is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler where they talk about the Superman Theory.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. DC Rebirth While imprisoned at Ryker's Island, Hammond is captured by a squad of Kroloteans who intend to weaponise his vast mental powers. Hammond succeeds in contacting Hal Jordan and Superman who arrive and defeat the Kroloteans after fighting through an illusion generated by Hammond. Furious, Hammond kills the Kroloteans and confesses to Hal that he is tired of everyone wanting to control him. He then tries to commit suicide by making Superman shoot him with his heat vision, but Hal stops him and the shot instead puts Hammond into a coma. Just before losing consciousness, he says that Hal was his hero. During the Darkstars Rising storyline, Hal breaks into Ryker's Island to try and recruit Hammond to combat the threat of the Darkstars. He instead encounters a reformed Atomic Skull who tries to stop him. Awakening from his coma, Hammond subdues Skull and nearly kills him only for Hal to talk him out of it. Expressing excitement at the opportunity to finally become a hero, Hammond agrees to help Green Lantern. Accompanying Hal to a frozen planet, Hammond is delighted to finally be able to explore space. Seeking to prove his newfound loyalty to Green Lantern, Hammond instead erases Hal's memories in order to keep him out of harm's way and declares his intention to kill every villain in the universe. Hal regains his identity and powers, leading Hammond to explain that his actions were to show Green Lantern that his guilt over his failures were just thoughts and not actions. During the battle between the Green Lantern Corps and the Darkstars, Hammond plays a vital role by disrupting the Controllers‚Äô psionic powers, leaving their entire army in disarray. Hammond seemingly disappears in the aftermath. Powers and abilities Hammond in his mutated state exhibits genius level intellect, as well as potent telepathic and telekinetic abilities including mind reading, mind control, astral projection, levitation, projecting harmful psionic blasts, moving physical objects with his mind, and on occasion displays the ability to absorb and mentally redirect Green Lantern's emerald plasma. In some incarnations, his body has atrophied to the point where he cannot walk and he has to strap his head to a chair to support its weight. As the host of Ophidian, he has access to the powers of an Orange Lantern, without needing an orange power ring to access them. Other versions Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Hector Hammond did not become a villain from a meteorite fragment. Instead, Hammond works as a private consultant to Ferris Aircraft with his test pilots Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris.Flashpoint: Hal Jordan #1 (June 2011) While inspecting Abin Sur's crashed spacecraft, Hammond does not trust Abin Sur and believes him to be preparing an alien invasion. However, the engineer Thomas Kalmaku tells him to rebuke his statement.Flashpoint: Hal Jordan #2 (July 2011) Later, Hammond modifies the F-35 and assigns Hal Jordan to pilot it against the Amazons' airforce of invisible planes.Flashpoint: Hal Jordan #3 (August 2011) Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! The 1980s series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! presented the parallel Earth of \\"Earth-C-Minus\\", a world populated by funny animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus features \\"Hector Hamhock\\", a pig counterpart of Hammond whose nemesis was the heroic Green Lambkin.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #14 (April 1983) Amalgam Comics Hammond was combined with Marvel Comics' MODOK to create HECTOR, the Highly Evolved Creature Totally Oriented for Revenge.

He is summoned by Amanda Waller of the DEO to conduct an autopsy of the recovered body of Abin Sur. During the operation he is infected with Parallax DNA hidden in Abin's wounds, which causes Hector's head to grow larger and gives him telepathic and telekinetic powers, which created a mental link between Parallax and Hammond. Hammond takes a liking to his new powers, which drives him insane, leading to him killing his father by burning him in a glass chamber. The infection has the side effect of weakening his body, to the point that he is forced to use a wheelchair in his final confrontation with Hal, but he still could talk even with his bulbous cranium. Under Parallax's orders to kill Hal, Hector abducts Carol Ferris with the intention of using her as a hostage and infecting her with a sample of Parallax DNA, but Hal offers to exchange his power ring for Carol. Hector agrees, only to go back on the deal so he can use the ring to kill Hal, but even though the ring is on Hammond's finger, Jordan still controls the ring's power, since he was the one the ring had chosen. Hal defeats Hammond by hurling his attack back on him. When Parallax soon after arrives on Earth, he kills Hammond for failing him.

She was the second ship to bear the name. Entering service in 1956, the ship underwent conversion to a destroyer helicopter escort (DDH) in 1962, the conversion performed primarily by Victoria Machinery Depot.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 245 She was officially reclassed with pennant DDH 234 on 28 June 1963. After being paid off in 1988, the vessel was used as a harbour training ship until being discarded in 1995. The vessel sank under tow to the breakers that year. Design and description St. Laurent-class destroyers in their original configuration The need for the St. Laurent class came about in 1949 when Canada joined NATO and the Cold War was in its infancy. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was assigned responsibility for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and controlling sea space in the western North Atlantic. The St Laurent class were built to an operational requirement much like that which produced the British Type 12, and were powered by the same machinery plant. The rounded deck-edge forward was adopted to prevent ice forming.Friedman, p. 161 The vessels were designed to operate in harsh Canadian conditions. They were built to counter nuclear, biological and chemical attack conditions, which led to a design with a rounded hull, a continuous main deck, and the addition of a pre-wetting system to wash away contaminants. The living spaces on the ship were part of a \\"citadel\\" which could be sealed off from contamination for the crew safety. The ships were sometimes referred to as \\"Cadillacs\\" for their relatively luxurious crew compartments; these were also the first Canadian warships to have a bunk for every crew member since previous warship designs had used hammocks.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 9‚Äì11 As built, the ships were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 17 The destroyer escorts displaced standard and at deep load.Conway's says 2000 tons standard displacement, 2600 deep load. The destroyer escorts had a crew of 12 officers and 237 enlisted. Armament The St. Laurent class was fitted with twin /L50 caliber guns in two mounts for engaging both surface and air targets. The ships were also fitted with two single-mounted guns. The class's anti-submarine armament consisted of a pair of triple-barreled Mk. NC 10 Limbo ASW mortars in a stern well. The stern well had a roller top to close it off from following seas. As with the British Type 12 design, the provision for long-range homing torpedoes (in this case BIDDER [Mk 20E] or the US Mark 35) were included. However, they were never fitted. Machinery The vessels of the St. Laurent class had two Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers installed. The steam produced by these boilers was directed at two geared steam turbines which powered two shafts, providing to drive the ship at a maximum speed of .Blackman, p. 35 The ships had an endurance of at . DDH conversion Following successful trials aboard the frigate and sister ship , plans to convert the St. Laurent class took shape.Soward 1995, pp. 63‚Äì65Blackman, pp. 35, 37 Th development of the beartrap, installed in Assiniboine during her 1962‚Äì63 conversion, finalized the concept. By keeping the aircraft secure, the beartrap eliminated the need for deck handling from landing to the hangar, or from hangar to takeoff. In the conversion to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Assiniboine was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fueling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough weather during helicopter operations.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 12‚Äì13 All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels to permit the forward extension of the helicopter hangar. To make room for the helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed.Chumbley & Gardiner, p. 44 The two 40 mm guns were also removed. Following the conversion, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to . DELEX program In the late 1970s, under the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program was commissioned to upgrade ten of the St. Laurent-class ships with new electronics, machinery, and hull upgrades and repairs. However, only enough was done to keep the ships in service into the late 1980s. For the St. Laurents, this meant hull and machinery repairs only.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 16 Operational history Assiniboine in 1982 Assiniboine was laid down on 19 May 1952 by Marine Industries at Sorel, Quebec and launched on 12 February 1954. The ship was commissioned at Sorel into the Royal Canadian Navy on 16 August 1956 and initially carried the hull number DDE 234 as a destroyer escort.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 18‚Äì19 After commissioning, Assiniboine was assigned to the east coast as part of the Third Canadian Escort Squadron. From October to November 1956, Assiniboine sailed with the First Canadian Escort Squadron to northern Europe, making a series of port visits. In January 1959, she transferred to the west coast and in July, carried Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip from Vancouver to Nanaimo. Assiniboine was a member of the Second Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. After returning from her conversion to a helicopter carrying destroyer, she was assigned once again to the east coast. The ship was used for trials of the beartrap hauldown system and spent the following two years finding inclement weather conditions to test the system. In 1974, Assiniboine was anchored in Lisbon, Portugal as part of the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic, with crew ashore, when the Carnation Revolution occurred. The tension and confusion of the situation saw the vessel recall her crew and leave the area. On 21 January 1975, Assiniboine recovered the crew from the freighter Barma, the rescue effort hampered by high winds. Assiniboine was selected by the Canadian Forces for the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program beginning on 23 April 1979 and completed this refit on 16 November. The refit was performed by Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec. On 2 July 1981, Assiniboine ran aground in Halifax Harbour in heavy fog, requiring the aid from several tugboats to get free. She had been scheduled to take part in a NATO exercise, but was removed after the ship was required to undergo damage inspection. In 1984, while acting as an escort for the Tall Ships race, she was part of the search for the crew of the lost sailing vessel Marques. In July 1984 the ship returned to Halifax with fractures in the plating of her upper deck. Assiniboine was sent to MIL Davie Shipbuilding at Sorel for a 10-month refit. The refit was extended to 17 months following a series of labour strikes at the shipyard. She was decommissioned from active service in the Canadian Forces on 14 December 1988 and was used as a harbour training ship at CFB Halifax beginning on 3 January 1989. The ship was sold for scrap in January 1995Colledge, p. 26 and sank in the Caribbean Sea while under tow.

August 1978) was a British teacher and amateur yachtsman who was one of nine westerners, and two Britons, known to fall victim to the Khmer Rouge during the rule of Pol Pot. Early life Dewhirst was born in the Jesmond district of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1952. His father was a headmaster, and his mother ran an antiques shop. In 1963, at age 11, the Dewhirst family moved to Cumbria. While growing up in Cumbria, Dewhirst became a sports enthusiast, and took a liking to outdoor activities. He spent most of his boyhood roaming the Cumbrian countryside. At Appleby Grammar School, Dewhirst developed a love for poetry and aspired to be a novelist. After finishing his A Levels, he won an English scholarship to study at Loughborough University. While studying at Loughborough University, he trained as a teacher. After receiving his degree in teaching, his desire for adventure and to become a writer led him to travel to Tokyo, Japan to teach English in 1977. Dewhirst also worked for The Japan Times from June 1977 to January 1978. Disappearance Some time in July 1978, while visiting a friend in the eastern Malaysian town of Kuala Terengganu, and en route from Japan back to England, Dewhirst met Canadian Stuart Glass and New Zealander Kerry Hamill, co-owners of a little Malaysian bedar named Foxy Lady. The three spent several weeks or a month together in Kuala Terengganu, and then headed north to Bangkok. For reasons that are unclear, Foxy Lady ended up in Cambodian waters and was seized, off Koh Tang, by a patrol vessel attached to Division 164 of the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea. Foxy Lady may have been on its way to Bangkok to pick up a load of Thai sticks. Glass had engaged in hashish smuggling before. Dewhirst's history in this area is unknown. His Kuala Terengganu friend has recalled Dewhirst speaking of planned adventures. Glass was shot and killed, or drowned, during the seizure. Dewhirst and Hamill may have been held for several days on a nearby island, and were then taken to the interrogation centre of S-21. S-21 records In early 1979, Vietnam defeated Democratic Kampuchea and overthrew the Pol Pot regime. They liberated Democratic Kampuchea's S-21 prison in the capital Phnom Penh where an estimated 20,000 people (the real number is unknown) had been sent for torture and execution (or taken to the Killing Fields for execution after being tortured), many of them for supposedly spying against Cambodia. Alleged photographs and forced confessions of nine missing Western yachtsmen (four Americans, two Australians, plus those of John Dewhirst and Kerry Hamill) were found in the prison files. The confessions of Dewhirst and Hamill revealed that they had been seized by a Khmer Rouge patrol vessel near the island of Koh Tang on the evening of 13 August 1978. Stuart Glass, the Canadian befriended by Dewhirst and Hamill, had been shot and killed during Foxy Ladys capture. Hamill and Dewhirst were both brought ashore and then taken by truck to Phnom Penh. Like the other Western yachtsmen, they were almost certainly tortured. The extent of their mistreatment is not clear. Dewhirst wrote several long confessions that mixed true events in his life with false accounts of his career as a CIA agent planning to subvert the Khmer Rouge regime. He claimed that his father (also an agent) had been paid a large bribe for inducting his son into the CIA and that his college course in Loughborough was interspersed with training as a spy. Dewhirst and Hamill signed a series of confessions between 3 September and 13 October 1978. John Dawson Dewhirst's first page of a forced confession when being tortured by the Cambodian Pol Pot Regime in the S-21 prison in Phnom Penh. The former administrator of the prison, Kang Kek Iew (also known as \\"Comrade Duch\\"), said that he remembered Dewhirst as \\"very polite\\". News of his death The circumstances of the deaths of Dewhirst and Hamill remain unclear. Their deaths were first reported in late 1979 and early 1980 by ABC News journalist Jim Laurie and freelance photographer Edward Rasen. Rasen provided more details, including photographs and portions of confessions in stories for the UK publication NOW! and the Australian Bulletin. During the 2009 trial of S-21 chief Kang Kek Iew, a former S-21 guard named Cheam Sour claimed that one of the eight Western yachtsmen held at S-21 was burned to death. Sensational reports that this individual was Dewhirst are unsubstantiated. Like other S-21 inmates, Dewhirst may well have been killed with a blow to the head. Kang Kek Iew said that he received orders from his superiors that the bodies of the murdered westerners had to be burned to remove all traces of their remains, adding, \\"I believe that nobody would dare to violate my orders\\".John Dewhirst, victim of Pol Pot's killing fields, may have been burned alive Aftermath On 10 November 2005, in an interview, Dewhirst's sister, Hilary Dewhirst-Holland told interviewers that she wants her brother's case to be detailed in the prosecution indictment against Kang Kek Iew.S-21 victim - John Dewhirst During Kang Kek Iew's trial beginning in 2007, Hillary did not attend the trial to testify against Kang Kek Iew. Instead, she handed a note to Rob Hamill, younger brother of Kerry Hamill, to share with the court.Andy's Cambodia: www.andybrouwer.co.uk On 27 August 2009, Rob Hamill appeared before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) as a civil party in Case 001, against Kang Kek Iew. In April 2011, Hamill applied to the ECCC once more for civil party status in ECCC Case 003, believed to involve former Khmer Rouge chief Meas Mut. As \\"Secretary\\" of Democratic Kampuchea's Division 164, comprising the country's navy, Mut would have been responsible for the gunning down of Stuart Glass and the seizure of Foxy Lady's two other crew, Kerry Hamill and John Dewhirst, as well as the arrest of the other six Western yachtsmen.\\"Number One Brother\\" blog, April 2011  See also  * List of people who disappeared * Malcolm Caldwell * Mayaguez Incident * Vann Nath * Chum Mey * Sean Flynn * Dana Stone * Fran√ßois Bizot References External links *Webpage for book Foxy Lady: Truth, Memory & the Death of Western Yachtsmen in Democratic Kampuchea.

A Republican and the son of Congressman and Governor Paul Dillingham, William P. Dillingham served as governor from 1888 to 1890 and United States Senator from 1900 until his death. Dillingham was born in Waterbury, Vermont in 1843, and attended schools in Vermont and New Hampshire. He studied law with his brother in law, Matthew Hale Carpenter, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in Waterbury and Montpelier. Groomed for a political career from an early age, Dillingham served as Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs (chief assistant to the governor) during his father's term and that of Asahel Peck, State's Attorney of Washington County, and member of the Vermont House of Representatives and Vermont State Senate. He was elected governor in 1888 and served one two-year term. In 1900, Dillingham won election to the United States Senate, replacing Jonathan Ross, who had been appointed as a temporary replacement following the death of incumbent Justin Smith Morrill. Dillingham served in the Senate until his death, and was chairman of several committees during his tenure. As head of a commission that studied immigration, he argued that southern and eastern European immigrants posed a threat to the country's stability and growth, and that immigration from those areas should be curbed in the future. Dillingham died in Montpelier in 1923 and was buried at Hope Cemetery in Waterbury. Early life The son of Governor Paul Dillingham, William P.

Ullery, Men of Vermont Illustrated, 1894, page 106 Dillingham practiced in Montpelier with Hiram A. Huse and Fred A. Howland. Howland was Dillingham's nephew, and had studied law with Dillingham to qualify for admission to the bar. Dillingham was elected to the United States Senate in 1900, replacing temporary appointee Jonathan Ross and completing the term of Justin Smith Morrill, who had died in office. Dillingham was reelected in 1903, 1909, 1914 and 1920, and served until his death. His 1914 election was Vermont's first following passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Courier-Journal Almanac, Men of the Year 1900, 1901, page 306 During his Senate career Dillingham was Chairman of the following committees: Transportation Routes to the Seaboard (Fifty-seventh Congress); Immigration (Fifty-eighth through Sixty-first Congresses); Privileges and Elections (Sixty-second, Sixty-sixth, and Sixty-seventh Congresses); and Establishing the University of the United States (Sixty-third through Sixty-fifth Congresses). Dillingham achieved prominence as the leading Progressive-era legislative spokesperson for restricting immigration. From 1907 to 1911, Dillingham chaired (concurrently with his Senate duties) the United States Immigration Commission, also called the Dillingham Commission, which concluded that immigration from southern and eastern Europe posed a serious threat to American society and culture and should be greatly reduced in the future.John J. Duffy, Samuel B. Hand, Ralph H. Orth, editors, The Vermont Encyclopedia, 2003, page 106 In 1903, Dillingham chaired a Senate subcommittee that investigated conditions in Alaska following the Klondike Gold Rush. During their trip, a new courthouse established near the Nushagak River village of Kanakanak was named in honor of the chairman and the surrounding community later adopted the name Dillingham, Alaska.

The series tells the story of an idol singer/martial artist and the chaos that results from her efforts to have a life and love beyond her singing career. An anime adaptation by Studio Kikan aired as part of the anthology program Eisei Anime Gekij≈ç which was broadcast on NHK. Synopsis Nagisa Shiratori is the heir to a judo training hall that has fallen on such hard times that their only pupils are animals from a nearby wildlife park. In a desperate bit to save her heritage, she reveals that she is going to go out into the world as an idol singer and find \\"strong men\\" to join her school. The first part of her plan succeeds beyond her wildest dreams: she is almost instantly elevated to the status of Japan's top idol despite an utter lack of anything even remotely resembling musical talent. Yet this dooms the second part of her plan, because her fame and schedule prevent her from finding the disciples she seeks. So Nagisa horrifies her manager by chopping off her trademark pigtails and enrolling at one of the worst schools in Tokyo as a boy, under her given name of Nagisa Ootori (Shiratori is a stage name). There she runs into the toughest gang at the school, and after she soundly beats them they (believing her to be a man) recruit her to help them confront a gang from a rival school. Unfortunately, when she sees the leader of the rival gang, a handsome boy named Nosaka-kun, she instantly falls madly in love with him. Before the fight can begin, Nagisa is whisked away to a record signing, where she encounters Nosaka again, who is so utterly smitten with Nagisa Shiratori that he proposes marriage on the spot. The next day the disguised Nagisa fights an inconclusive duel with Nosaka that ends in a stalemate, and with Nosaka declaring her a worthy foe he looks forward to fighting again. He later reveals to the female Nagisa that he too in on a quest to recruit disciples for a failing martial arts school, and is meeting with a similar lack of success. The next day, in their final confrontation, Nosaka discovers Nagisa's secret due to an ill-placed grab maneuver. Declaring he would rather love Nagisa than fight her, he agrees to keep her secret and they run off, with the school toughs and both their disapproving fathers in hot pursuit. After that, Nagisa continues her double life, showing up at school some of the time when her manager cannot force her to attend to her idol responsibilities. Meanwhile, the world she lives in gets weirder and weirder, as more and more bizarre things happen in her proximity.  Characters  ;Nagisa Ootori/Nagisa Shiratori : :Nagisa is the young, pink-pigtailed protagonist of the story. While she loves to sing and dance (and is very good as well) she says that she loves to \\"toss people around\\" more. Her strength and fighting ability are overwhelmingly large, and she uses them on both people and the wildlife she trains in her dojo. She is very ambitious and isn't afraid to go after what she wants. ;Nosaka Akira : :Nagisa's love interest, confidante and secret fianc√©. He is quite devoted but he is impulsive and protective to a fault, despite the fact that Nagisa is in less need of protection than anyone he has ever known. ;Momoko Prisila : :A wealthy dilettante who is determined to become the greatest actress in the world and supplant Nagisa as the most popular idol in Japan (one of her more \\"rational\\" goals is to be more famous than Audrey Hepburn.) As part of this process, she is \\"building a repertoire\\" of roles she can assumes. At least twice an episode, Momoko can be counted upon to show up at a random time, do something incredibly bizarre, and then leave, usually being driven off in her stretch limousine by the young man who adoringly follows her everywhere to the praises of a quartet of identical cheerleaders who might be robots. There are strong hints that she may have the power to literally manipulate and warp reality at will through her method acting. ;Kumakichi :A large blue bear who is one of Nagisa's best friends from her dojo, who now lives with her in Tokyo and occasionally takes part in her act. Contrary to anime-fan expectations, Kumakichi actually is a bear and is usually incapable of speech. ;Makoto Naketake : :Nagisa's long-suffering manager who fears that her irresponsibility is going to cost him his job. He poses as a teenage boy to enroll with Nagisa at the school so he can keep her under observation, a task that usually proves futile. Even though he continues to remain in the idol agency's employ, he continues to worry about it to extreme lengths, even developing a song of his own called \\"The Worry Blues\\" as a running gag. ;Tsunada-kun :The leader of the hoodlums at Nagisa's school, an ardent fan of Nagisa the idol singer, and a combination friend and antagonist for Nagisa the martial artist. He is bald, with a head shaped like a volcano that erupts on occasion, as a result of a childhood accident. Despite his rough appearance and speech, he is from a rich family and is surprisingly intelligent and resourceful. He is completely unable to decipher Nagisa's secret despite the fact that she does a poor job of impersonating a male. As a result of this, he completely misinterprets her relationship with his bitter rival Nosaka. Like Nosaka, he is very protective of Nagisa Shiratori and will attempt to charge to the rescue if he believes she is in danger. ;Red Beetle :An international agency/conspiracy that keeps an iron grip on the market for idols on every nation on Earth except Japan. They frequently send rivals forth to break Nagisa's grip on the hearts of the Japanese public, who always fail despite Nagisa's lack of interest in defending her position on top. ;Kamioka Ryuu : ;The Alligators of Tokyo :A group of juvenile alligators who have somehow managed to become the pets of most of Japan's female idol community. Nagisa becomes involved with them and is persuaded to stage a Benefit concert to return them to their native habitat in Florida, much to the chagrin of the gators, who find themselves outmatched in the wild and return to Tokyo.

However, in clinical diagnostics labs it has been largely superseded by other serological methods such as ELISA and by DNA-based methods of pathogen detection, particularly PCR. Process The complement system is a system of serum proteins that react with antigen-antibody complexes. If this reaction occurs on a cell surface, it will result in the formation of trans-membrane pores and therefore destruction of the cell. The basic steps of a complement fixation test are as follows: # Serum is separated from the patient. # Patients naturally have different levels of complement proteins in their serum. To negate any effects this might have on the test, the complement proteins in the patient's serum must be destroyed and replaced by a known amount of standardized complement proteins. ## The serum is heated in such a way that all of the complement proteins‚Äîbut none of the antibodies‚Äîwithin it are destroyed. (This is possible because complement proteins are much more susceptible to destruction by heat than antibodies.) ## A known amount of standard complement proteins are added to the serum. (These proteins are frequently obtained from guinea pig serum.) # The antigen of interest is added to the serum. # Sheep red blood cells (sRBCs) which have been pre-bound to anti-sRBC antibodies are added to the serum. The test is considered negative if the solution turns pink at this point and positive otherwise. If the patient's serum contains antibodies against the antigen of interest, they will bind to the antigen in step 3 to form antigen-antibody complexes. The complement proteins will react with these complexes and be depleted. Thus when the sRBC-antibody complexes are added in step 4, there will be no complement left in the serum. However, if no antibodies against the antigen of interest are present, the complement will not be depleted and it will react with the sRBC-antibody complexes added in step 4, lysing the sRBCs and spilling their contents into the solution, thereby turning the solution pink. Testing for antigen While detection of antibodies is the more common test format, it is equally possible to test for the presence of antigen. In this case, the patient's serum is supplemented with specific antibody to induce formation of complexes; addition of complement and indicator sRBC is performed as before. Semi-quantitative testing The test can be made quantitative by setting up a series of dilutions of patient serum and determining the highest dilution factor that will still yield a positive CF test. This dilution factor corresponds to the titer.

Hochzoll is bordered on its west by the Lech river, whose waters also feed the Kuhsee (Cow lake) to the south of Hochzoll. To the east, Hochzoll shares its city border with that of Friedberg West, a district of the town of Friedberg. Road and rail links The main road through Augsburg Hochzoll is the Bundesstrasse 300, which is also designated as the Bundesstrasse 2 for that part which goes through Hochzoll. The latter turns in the east of Hochzoll to the south, and forms part of the border between Hochzoll and Friedberg West. Approximately 200 meters south of the road bridge, a bridge for the railway line Augsburg-Munich also crosses the Lech. East of the railway bridge there is the station Hochzoll, at which the Paartalbahn railway line branches off of the main route to Ingolstadt. This light-rail route runs about parallel to the B 300, while the main route of the Augsburg‚ÄìMunich line turns south towards Munich in a long-drawn-out curve. History The history of Hochzoll has at its origin a bridging over the Lech river in the year 980. As the Lech is the historical border between Oberbayern (Upper Bavaria) and Schwaben (Swabia), and as the construction of bridges was very expensive at the time, a bridge toll was raised (HochZoll - High Tariff). Also, as the town charter for the municipality Friedberg emanates from the year 1264, the Lech also served as the border between Augsburg and Friedberg. The district of Hochzoll today then belonged to Friedberg and was referred to as Friedberger Au. The history of the district has always been strongly shaped by the construction of bridges. * 1639 the Lech bridge goes up in flames as a result of war and can only be rebuilt through subsidies from the realm of the city of Augsburg. * 1646 during the siege of Augsburg by French and Swedish armies, the bridge again goes up in flames. * 1796 the destroyed bridge, by order of the French general Moreau, is rebuilt by carpenters from Augsburg. * 1797 French troops burn the bridge down again, but in the two subsequent years reconstruction of the bridge takes place successfully. * 1800 Bavarian military heavily damages the bridge ‚Äì but with subsequent immediate repair - complete renewal of the bridge is accomplished a few years later. From 1803 onwards the Auen is increasingly settled east of the Lech. * 1818 the scattered settlements comprise 24 estates. Hochzoll, Kolonie, Kolonie an der Lechbr√ºcke and Ein√∂den now comprehensively form the 172 inhabitant parish community of Friedbergerau. * 1839/1840 building of a wooden course bridge as a part of the building of the railway line Augsburg - Munich. * 1840 at the estate \\"Stierhof\\" the first Hochzoll railway station is built on the newly constructed railway line Augsburg - Munich. * 1851 a flood destroys the road bridge. * 1855 the city of Augsburg builds a new heavy timber bridge for road traffic. * 1862 the wooden railway bridge is replaced by a latticed bridge made of steel. * 1874 through construction of the Paartalbahn arises the station Hochzoll, the number of inhabitants increase, through immigration of industrial workers, to 350. * 1877 establishment of a voluntary fire-brigade. * 1878 the road bridge collapses, as floodwater wash away the columns from under the bridge and deposit them 50 meters up the Lech. An emergency bridge is constructed in its place. * 1891 a road bridge made of iron replaces the emergency bridge which was established in 1878. * 1905 the parish of Friedbergerau takes the name Hochzoll. * 1910 a flood damages large parts of the village. The old weir on the Lech ‚Äì called Hochablass (high drain) ‚Äì was destroyed by the flood and reconstructed later. * 1911 first electrical road lighting. * 1913 incorporation: Together with Lechhausen the village of Hochzoll, whose population has increased in the meantime to 1708 inhabitants, becomes a district of Augsburg. * 1915/1916 a new school building \\"Holzerau\\" is established. * 1926 a new steel arch construction replaces the lattice bridge of the railway. This \\"new\\" bridge was still in use up to the year 2002. * 1928 new building of a 120 meters long steel-reinforced concrete bridge, which was renovated in 1990. * 1929 Hochzoll is attached to the town gas supply network. * 1934 the Stra√üenbahn line 6 is built on the Friedberger road, over the Lech bridge, and up to Zugspitz street. (opened on 9 May 1934) * 1944 several houses fall victim to allied bombs. * 1945, 28 April, the US army rolls unhindered through Hochzoll towards Friedberg. * 1946 war refugees find a new homeland in Hochzoll. * 1954 there are now over 5.000 inhabitants. * 1957 laying of the foundation stone of the European village. * 1969 Hochzoll is divided into north and south. * Starting from 1970 the settlement of Hochzoll begins, with the establishment of housing estates south of Oberl√§nder street, to push against its boundaries. * 1972 the Eiskanal (a canoe racing channel running parallel to the Lech) is built as part of the 1972 Summer Olympic games held in Munich. As part of the construction measures of the Eiskanal, the Kuhsee is built in the popular local recreation area in the south of Hochzoll. Also in this year the fifth to eighth level auxiliary classes, which were previously provided at the Holbein-Gymnasium (specialising in the natural sciences and languages), were shifted to the now finished Rudolf Diesel Gymnasium. At present over 1.150 pupils visit this Gymnasium (High School). * 1976 16 September, the Rudolf Diesel Gymnasium at Friedberger street takes up its training enterprise. * 1990 reconstruction of the road bridge * 2000‚Äì2003 the 1926 built railway bridge, in the course of the four track development of the Augsburg - Munich line, is replaced by two new steel arch bridges.

Despite the presence of volcanic ash layers that are key to dating, the cranium is only generally dated between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago due to taphonomic issues. The 2006 discovery was reported by Sileshi Semaw, director of the Gona Project, which is based at the Stone Age Institute and Indiana University Bloomington's CRAFT research center. Discovery and significance The hominin skull was discovered by Asahmed Humet, a member of the Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project; he found the recently resurfaced fossil in a small erosion gully that empties into the Gawis river drainage basin in the Afar Region, some 300 miles northeast of Addis Ababa. The skull is a nearly complete cranium of what is believed to be a Middle Pleistocene human ancestor. While different from a modern human, the braincase, upper face and jaw of the cranium have unmistakable anatomical evidence that belong to human ancestry. The discovery was reported by Sileshi Semaw, director of the Gona Project at the Stone Age Institute.https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q;=%22Sileshi+Semaw%22+gawis&btnG;=Search Semaw noted the skull fossil could be a transitional form that fills a gap in human evolutionary origins. He described its appearance as intermediate between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens. Significant archaeological collections of stone tools and numerous fossil animal specimens were also found at the site. Gawis is in the Gona Research Project study area situated in the Awash River Valley. Immediately to the east of Gona, also located along the Awash and one of its tributaries is the site of Hadar, where in 1974 U.S. scientist Donald Johanson found the 3.2-million-year-old remains of an Australopithecus afarensis, known as Lucy. The Middle Awash project, site of many other hominin discoveries, is to the south. In addition to the Gawis cranium, the Gona project area has yielded some of the world's oldest stone tools (2.6 million years old), as well as fossils of Ardipithecus ramidus‚Äîhominid, and debated as whether or not hominin‚Äîdated to approximately 4.5 million years ago.

Early life Breckinridge Long was born on May 16, 1881 to Margaret Miller Breckinridge and William Strudwick Long in St. Louis, Missouri. Long was a member of the Breckinridge family, which has been described as \\"practically Confederate aristocracy\\". Long was a distant cousin of Henry Skillman Breckinridge (1886‚Äì1960), who was the United States Assistant Secretary of War from 1913-1916 under Wilson, and whose daughter married John Stephens Graham, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and commissioners for the Internal Revenue Service and Atomic Energy Commission. Long graduated from Princeton University in 1904 and studied at Washington University School of Law from 1905 to 1906, and received his M.A. from Princeton University in 1909. Career In 1906, he was admitted to the bar in Missouri and opened an office in St. Louis in 1907. Long continued to practice law independently until 1917. From 1914 to 1915, he was a member of the Missouri Code Commission on Revision of Judicial Procedure. Long then worked to establish the League of Nations and supported Wilsonian Democracy. He was credited with drafting Woodrow Wilson's \\"He kept us out of war\\" slogan, which helped secure Wilson's reelection as President in 1916. He joined the State Department shortly after the election. In 1917, Long was appointed Third Assistant Secretary of State and remained at the post until he resigned in 1920 to pursue election to the U.S. Senate from Missouri. While in the Department of State, he held responsibility for overseeing Asian affairs. During this time he also directed attention to the improvement of U.S. foreign communications policy, and coordinated the first interdepartmental review of U.S. international communications. In 1920 Long was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat in Missouri held by Selden P. Spencer, but was defeated, garnering 44.5% of the vote to Spencer's 53.7%. He lost a second bid for the Senate in 1922. FDR administration and World War II Long was a personal friend of future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom he had known as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Wilson Administration, and generously contributed to his 1932 Presidential campaign. Roosevelt rewarded him with the position of U.S. Ambassador to Italy, which he held from 1933 to 1936. During his ambassadorship, he was criticized for advising the president against imposing an embargo on oil shipments to Italy in retaliation for Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. He was a member of a special mission to Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay in 1938. Upon the outbreak of war in September 1939, he accepted appointment as a special assistant secretary of state in charge of problems arising from the war, a position he held until January 1940, when he was appointed assistant secretary of state. Through February 1941, he was responsible for overseeing twenty-three of the forty-two divisions in the department before a revision of the workload among the other assistant secretaries.Breckinridge Long, The War Diary of Breckinridge Long: Selections from the Years 1939-1944, selected and edited by Fred L. Israel (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1966), pp. 178, 184. Long came to believe that he was under constant attack from what he termed radicals and the Jewish press for his stance on strict immigration controls mandated by the immigration laws in force at the time. In an intra-department memo he circulated in June 1940 Long wrote: \\"We can delay and effectively stop for a temporary period of indefinite length the number of immigrants into the United States. We could do this by simply advising our consuls to put every obstacle in the way and to require additional evidence and to resort to various administrative devices which would postpone and postpone and postpone the granting of the visas.\\" One of his most powerful tools to keep out potential refugees and immigrants was the Public charge rule, which barred admissions of persons deemed likely to become a burden on the state. The standards of proof of not being a public charge were constantly shifting, and this was used to intentionally prevent refugees and immigrants from gaining admission. Ultimately, the effect of the immigration policies set by Long's department was that, during American involvement in the war, ninety percent of the quota places available to immigrants from countries under German and Italian control were never filled. If they had been, an additional 190,000 people could have escaped the atrocities being committed by the Nazis. In November 1943, when the House was considering two bills that would have established a separate government agency charged with assisting the rescue of Jewish refugees, Long gave secret testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee saying that the majority of 580,000 refugees admitted from Europe were Jewish, and that such legislation would be a rebuke of the State Department in wartime. Long noted in his diary that day that he'd erred by speaking without notes (the actual numbers were 568,000 visas authorized and only 545,000 issued), but historians have noted his testimony was misleading because he implied that all of those were Jews.The War Diary of Breckinridge Long: Selections from the Years 1939-1944, pp. 334-335. Long is largely remembered for his obstructionist role as the official responsible for granting refugee visas during World War II. He \\"obstructed rescue attempts, drastically restricted immigration, and falsified figures of refugees admitted. The exposure of his misdeeds led to his demotion, in 1944. He has become the major target of criticism of America's refugee and rescue policy.\\" He justified this in his diary by referencing the contemporary strict laws in the United States imposing quotas on the number of immigrants from particular countries, and his great concern about the possibility that Germany and the Soviet Union would introduce spies or subversive agents into the United States amidst the large numbers of refugees.The War Diary of Breckinridge Long, passim. Long resigned from the State Department in November 1944 and went into retirement. Personal life He married Christine Alexander Graham, in 1912. Their daughter, Christine Blair Long, married Arnold Willcox. His special interests included the collection of antiques, paintings and American ship models. He maintained a stable of thoroughbred race horses and was a director of the Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, and he enjoyed fox hunting, fishing, and sailing. He died in Laurel, Maryland on September 26, 1958. His widow died in Palm Beach, Florida in 1959, aged 71. Legacy His personal papers are available for research at the Library of Congress.

The novels are written by K≈ç Akizuki, and feature an amateur orchestra, its concertmaster and its conductor. Tonoin Kei, a musical genius who has studied extensively in the area of conducting, falls in love with violinist and music teacher, Morimura Yuuki. Morimura also acts as concertmaster for the amateur orchestra that meets three times a week at the Fujimi Civic Center. Morimura is in love with Kawashima Natsuko, a female flutist in the orchestra, but Kawashima falls for Tonoin when he joins as the group's new conductor in order to get closer to Morimura. The unfolding relationships serve as the bases of the stories. Plot Fujimi Orchestra is primarily about Tonoin and Morimura's romance, but also follows their musical careers. After being berated by Tonoin time and again, Morimura says he wants to quit the orchestra. To prevent this, Tonoin steals his violin and leads him to his house, where he forces himself on the violinist. Upon realizing that the encounter is Morimura's first time with a male lover, he is remorseful and confesses his love, telling him that Kawashima does not love him. With emotions overwhelming him, Morimura flees, but slips down a flight of wet stairs. Tonoin nurses the injured violist back to health, proving his devotion is genuine. In the end, Morimura stays with Fujimi Orchestra despite Tonoin's continued pressure to improve his playing while surreptitiously pursuing the man behind closed doors. Media The novels are published by Kadokawa Ruby Bunko, a publishing company which specializes in Boy's Love titles. The first 16 novels and 3 additional character books were illustrated by Nishi Keiko, while all those that have been released since have been illustrated by Sei Goto. The first and fourth stories in the series were made into a manga which was illustrated by Goto. The series also has a number of audio drama and musical accompaniment CDs released by Sony Music (Liner Notes Music) and June Collections. The series also had an Original Video Animation made for it entitled Cold Front - The Storm After the Rain, which featured the first story (entitled Cold Front Conductor in the novel), in which Kei and Yuuki meet and events are set into motion. The OVA is actually from Morimura's perspective (as are the novels and the majority of the drama CDs), and is set after things have begun, so Yuuki explains the situation in retrospect.

The 1905 synod of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, meeting in Utrecht (Conclusion of Utrecht), declared: These 1905 \\"Conclusions of Utrecht\\" were adopted by the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church in North America in 1908. They were challenged from time to time, given an \\"official interpretation\\" by the Synod of 1962, and finally set aside in 1968. Theologians of the Liberated, Free Reformed, and Netherlands Reformed traditions oppose the doctrine. They charge this doctrine with providing parents and especially young adults with a false ground for the assurance of their salvation. Parents begin to regard their children as saved because they were baptized. Young adults begin to regard themselves as regenerate because they were baptized. Pastors begin to assume that everyone in their church is regenerate. Thus very little of the preaching is directed to unconverted persons and often neglects the necessity of repentance. These theologians would point to a document like the Westminster Larger Catechism as teaching the true ground for one's assurance of their own salvation. > Question 80: Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the > estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation? > Answer: Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavor to walk in all good > conscience before him, may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith > grounded upon the truth of God's promises, and by the Spirit enabling them > to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are > made, and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of > God, be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall > persevere therein unto salvation. > Question 81: Are all true believers at all times assured of their present > being in the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved? > Answer: Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith, > true believers may wait long before they obtain it; and, after the enjoyment > thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, > sins, temptations, and desertions; yet are they never left without such a > presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into > utter despair. Some Netherlands Reformed Church theologians might additionally point to a mystical revelation of God to the soul as providing the true ground for one's assurance. Such is their interpretation, for example, of Romans 8:16. > The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now > if we are children, then we are heirs‚Äîheirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, > if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his > glory. The term \\"regeneration\\" is also affected by subtle shifts in meaning. John Calvin considered regeneration to represent the activity of New Birth - not its completion. While the current usage of the term looks back on New Birth, early on it meant the process of new birth itself, that is that God is working in the life of His children. His commentary on John 3. and many of his defenses of infant baptism in the Institutes. show this interest not to consider regeneration only as a single event in the believer's life.

The second and better-known version had none of the previous members and consisted of Andy Anderson on vocals (initially also on drums), Chris Gray on keyboards and harmonica, Doug Ford on vocals and guitar, Baden Hutchens on drums, and Ian Thomas on bass, and released their debut album, The Missing Links in December. According to Allmusic's, Richie Unterberger, \\"This aggregation cut the rawest Australian garage/punk of the era, and indeed some of the best from anywhere, sounding at their best like a fusion of the Troggs and the early Who, letting loose at times with wild feedback that was quite ahead of its time.\\" History Origins The Missing Links formed in early 1964 in Sydney, Australia with the line-up of Peter Anson on guitar, Dave Boyne on guitar, Bob Brady on vocals, Danny Cox on drums and Ron Peel on bass guitar (ex-Mystics). With their long hair, according to one venue owner, \\"they looked like a cross between man and ape\\" and so were named, the Missing Links (see transitional fossil). In November, the group played a benefit concert to support Oz founders, Richard Neville, Richard Walsh and Martin Sharp. The trio had been charged with obscenity and were awaiting trial. The first version of the band recorded a single, \\"We 2 Should Live\\" which was released in March 1965 on the Parlophone label. By that time, Boyne was replaced on guitar by John Jones (Mystics) and Cox left soon after with New Zealand-born Andy Anderson (as Andy James aka Neville Anderson) joining, initially on drums.Marks, Ian D. and McIntyre, Iain.

Peter Anson formed a band, the Syndicate.They evolved into Jeff St. John and The Id. Bob Brady joined Python Lee Jackson, and Ron Peel joined Brisbane- based group, The Pleazers. In 1968 He became Rockwell T. James and formed The Rhythm Aces. A single \\"Love Power\\" was released. Ronnie then went to England and joined Thunderclap Newman and later on, The La-De-Das.By 1976 he was Rockwell T.

Longmore was soon replaced by Doug Ford with Chris Gray joining on keyboards and harmonica, Baden Hutchens on drums and Ian Thomas on bass guitar (both ex-Showmen) completed the line-up of the second version, which was \\"even more fierce version than the first\\".Marks, Ian D. and McIntyre, Iain.

He died of AIDS in 1992.  Early life  Slater was born in 1938 in a lower- middle-class Jewish neighborhood of New York City. At a very early age, he became aware of anti-Semitism which was encouraged by the Catholic Church. This became one of the influences that led him to witchcraft. Slater studied business administration at New York University, liberal arts at Hunter College and traffic management at the Traffic Management Institute in New York. He also completed a full course at the United States Navy Personnel School in Bainbridge, Maryland. During 1958 through 1969, Slater had several business jobs in management, traffic expediting, and insurance claims investigation. 1969 marked the beginning of significant health-related issues for him. He was later forced to quit work due to bone tuberculosis, which cost him a hip bone and three years of recuperation.  Transition to witchcraft  During his recuperation process, Slater began experiencing and reading about paranormal phenomena, including divination (tarot cards), clairvoyance, and levitation. He spent an entire year lying in bed in a body cast that weighed 300 pounds. Then one morning, he awoke to find himself stretched across a chair on the opposite side of the room while still in his body cast. These experiences led him to witchcraft, and in 1972 He met Eddie Buczynski (Lord Gwyddion), and they partnered in the Warlocke Shoppe, on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights. It was there that two witches from England gave them the Welsh Tradition Book of Shadows and Herman and Eddie self initiated. Slater took the name Lord Govannon, and Eddie Lord Gwyddion. Eddie later made trips to Egypt and became part of an all male Minoan magic group in New York. Some of the original members of the coven Herman and Eddie formed left to form their own group. among these were authors Denny Sargent, who with Robert Carey, were co editors of a magazine for aspiring teen magicians called Mandragore. They and other members of the original coven moved on to ceremonial magic, and subscribed to an O.T.O. correspondence course that was based out of London in the mid seventies. In 1977, the O.T.O. came to Slater's Magickal Childe, his new location in Manhattan's Chelsea.  Career  Bucznski and Slater opened The Warlock Shoppe, the oldest witchcraft bookshop in Brooklyn, New York. Buczynski was the more magical and spiritual of the two and left the business side to Slater, who helped the shop grow in profit. Most importantly, the shop established itself as the central information hub for local witches and the newly emerging neopagan communities. The two also published a periodical called Earth Religion News. It was extremely successful but also caused controversy due to its explicit contents and cover designs. In 1974, Slater was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition and assumed leadership of the coven in the late 1970s. The Warlock Shoppe later moved to West 19th Street in Manhattan (the borough of New York City) and operated under the name Magickal Childe. The Magickal Childe functioned as a major focal point for the neopagan community in the 1970s and well into the 1990s. In the later 1980s it gained something of a mercenary reputation being willing to put 'curses' on people for a price. with Slater's death they started having trouble making ends meet and several significant new age publishers stopped providing them with books. The brick and mortar store finally closed in 1999.  Scandals  In 1972, Slater presented the Inquisitional Bigot of the Year award to NBC during a guest appearance on the Today show, for an episode of Macmillan and Wife that had taken witchcraft and corrupted it into devil-worship rituals for the plot. The crew of Today had Slater physically removed from the set. More controversy surrounding Slater's actual proficiency in the types of magick he claimed to practice, accusations that he plagiarized material, yelling out at irritable customers in his Magickal Childe store, \\"Get out of my store...\\", as well as outrage over other behaviors he exhibited earned him the nickname \\"Horrible Herman\\".  Works  Slater wrote the books: * Introduction to Witchcraft, , * The Hoodoo Bible, https://openlibrary.org/books/OL11535906M/Hoodoo_Bible * A Book of Pagan Rituals I & II, * Pagan Rituals III, Published: * Earth Religion News magazine Edited: * The Magickal Formulary Spellbook, ,http://www.magickalchilde.com/Book1.htm * The Magickal Formulary Spellbook II, http://www.magickalchilde.com/Book2.htm These two witchcraft cookbooks are based on the inner workings of his shop and formulas of his potions. They are sold worldwide and are well-respected within the witchcraft community.http://members.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&userid;=joliett The Magickal Childe now continues with an Internet presence.http://www.magickalchilde.com  Educating others  Educating people on the subject of witchcraft became an important mission for Slater. He frequently lectured as a guest speaker at many colleges. He starred in his own video, An Introduction to Witchcraft and Satanism, in which he wore ceremonial robes and headdresses typical of witchcraft. He also appeared with his familiar companion, a snake named Herman. He also hosted a weekly cable show which aired in Manhattan, called The Magickal Mystery Tour. The show featured interviews, rituals, music, occultism, and magick instruction. He thought of the show as an Earth religion 700 Club because it spread the word on the Old Religion and asked for donations.  Philosophy  Herman Slater considered Wicca to be an earth religion. In the early days of the Warlocke Shop he hosted The Pagan Way lectures, usually in a coven members apartment and sometimes his own on Atlantic Avenue. The Pagan Way ran the gammit, embracing the various pre-christian religions and paranormal. Some of the Pagan Way lecturers promoted their works, including Dr. Leo Martello. Herman was tolerant of quite a lot, but would rein in adult activities if he expected youth to be present. His come all approach overwhelmed him in his Manhattan location, and with Eddie seldom around, Herman was preyed upon. He never requested money for the lectures or use of his ritual room, and sometimes complained that the Wiccans were there a lot but spent very little money, though the satanists had cash. Even so, he provided a platform for alternative religions as long as he could. Herman was about inclusion, self empowerment,and love.  Praise  One of Slater's former employees described him as \\"Very bright, almost schizophrenic, fiercely loyal one moment, then your brutal enemy the next. I loved and hated him so many times in turn that it's all a blur.\\"http://austanspace.blogspot.com/2009/02/herman-slater.html However, many loyal followers were befriended by Slater, including most of his loyal employees, loving family and friends. He was affectionately known as Mother Herman to those he cared about. Herman's attraction to witchcraft was not limited to paranormal experiences. He was truly on a spiritual quest for a religion that would not condemn his sexuality, and believed homosexuality was the expression of a man finding completion of his soul through the love of another man. Wicca had no taboos regarding homosexuality or self empowerment, another of Herman's quests that he shared with the world. Among his famous quotes was:\\"everythings in print now.\\" Meaning magic was no longer held in the hands of the elite alone. http://www.magickalchilde.com/herman.html  See also  * Witchcraft  Sources  ; Footnotes ; Bibliography *  External links   Collection of citations Category:1935 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Gardnerian Wiccans Category:Writers from New York City Category:American book editors Category:Witchcraft Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:Converts from Judaism Category:LGBT Wiccans Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Gay writers Category:AIDS-related deaths in New York (state) Category:20th-century American male writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Wiccans of Jewish descent ","title":"Herman Slater"},{"id":"4517281","text":"PRO Group, Inc. is a retailers' cooperative and distributors' cooperative with over $3 billion in annual sales.

The OAVs were distributed in Japan by Sh≈çnen Gaho-sha and JVC and in North America by U.S. Manga Corps under a single title. The manga was partially translated by CPM Manga. A sidestory, drawn by Isamu Imakake (running in Monthly OURsLITE from December 2000 to June 2001) was released as '''''. Also known as AA, Atomic Attack relates how the female were-cat Vashuka went to Russia to get the warhead that gets featured in \\"Get Back the Kitty\\". The main storyline in Geobreeders parts 1 and 2 ended with volume 16 of the manga. Itou attempted to start part 3, with only Taba reappearing three years later, but only three known chapters ran in Young King Ours in 2009 before Itou fell ill and stopped drawing altogether. Geobreeders is currently on hiatus. The first OVA was later broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from April 14, 2004 to May 12, 2004. Plot Ayagane City has a phantom cat (also called \\"bake neko\\" and \\"were-cat\\") problem. A young and overzealous group of entrepreneurs called Kagura Total Security can be hired to combat this problem for the right price when Hound, the official government arm, isn't enough. However, there are plots and subplots floating beneath the surface, both involving Kagura, and the were-cats, led by Kuro-Neko, themselves. Both the manga and the OVAs are heavily action-driven, with gunfights appearing every few chapters. Characters ; : : Looking younger than she really is, Yuka, CEO of Kagura Total Security (Á•ûÊ•ΩÁ∑èÂêàË≠¶ÂÇô Kagura S≈çsei Keibi or \\"Kagura Synthesis Guard\\") comes across as a flighty, childish girl. However, commenting on having seen a TV show that had aired in Japan in the late 70s, she accidentally dates herself as being at least 20 years old. Her primary weapon is a crossbow, and she usually wears tight-fitting clothing and a bandanna. In flashbacks, she is revealed to have worked under the name \\"Rika Kikushima\\" in Kagura Co. ver. 3 along with her real-life older sister, Yuma, and Luger Ryuu. At the end of volume 16, she assists Yuma in setting up Kagura Co. ver. 5. ; : : Maki considers herself to be the \\"mysterious gun person,\\" of the cast, often quoting from Akira Kobayashi and Keiichiro Akagi films. She is a firearm expert, and her favorite pistol is a Colt revolver, although she is also an excellent sniper. As a high school girl, she had fallen in love with \\"Luger\\" Ryuu and trained under him to become a marksman. In the underworld, she is known as \\"Crimson Shooting Star\\", and is either the fastest, or second fastest draw after Ryuu. She is last seen in volume 16 when fighting members of Irie is black ops squad. ; : : Eiko is the more elegant, sophisticated member of Kagura Co. She handles financing, accounting and day-to-day operations. She is also a master hand-to-hand fighter, preferring to use a pair of brass knuckles. She has one known nephew, Yuuki. In volume 9 she is shown to have extra-bushy eyebrows that need to be plucked constantly, and a dangerous pyromaniac streak, threatening to burn down everything when she gets impatient. She mentions at one point that she came to Kagura to avoid office sexual harassment. Last seen in volume 16, when the Kagura offices are blown up. ; : : Cute, short and with glasses, Takami is the primary computer hacker, working with Yuka to upgrade the containment software system. She uses rollerblades to get around at speeds close to 30 miles an hour (rivaling the speeds of cars on city streets), and favors butterfly knives with grenades attached. She gets her grenades from Maki is gun supplier. Is strongly attracted to Taba but too shy to come right out and say it, although she gets close in volume 11. She'll often collapse into a quivering pile when panicked. She is also an otaku, occasionally taking breaks from the company to help her friends produce doujinshii. Takami is last seen in the clutches of Irie is black ops group, being forced to delete all of the Kagura company servers. ; : : Yu is Kagura's primary driver, although that job will go to Taba if Yu is passed out or unavailable. She can steer anything with a wheel, but when not actually driving will fall heavily asleep. She mentions at one point that she sees herself as the wheel of a car‚Äîif she is not moving, then she is not accomplishing anything. In volume 3, she is shown to have one older brother and five sisters, who like to torment her when she is asleep. She is also a chain smoker, preferring \\"Lucky Strike Ultra Milds\\". Yu is last seen in volume 16 trying to drive away from Irie in an open jeep. ; : : Yoichi starts out as an unemployed salaryman responding to a job wanted ad from Kagura Co. Then, for the next several volumes, he focuses on trying to quit. He turns out to be a good strategist and capable with a crossbow and the Kagura protect seals. In volume 6, he states that his job is to do all of the falling for the other members. He becomes attracted to Ayumi Narusawa, the female sniper for Hound, and the two of them have sex in volume 15. Taba is asked by both Irie to join Hound, and by Kuro-Neko to act as a go-between for Kagura and the were-cats, although he turns down both of them. When he was about five years old, Taba had a pet kitten but was forced by his mother to abandon it at a nearby shrine. The kitten later turns out be Maya. Yoichi is the only surviving member of Kagura Co. ver. 4, other than Yuka, at the end of Part 2. He resurfaces three years later as a salaryman at a company that supplies Shin- Nihon Avionics and Zinguzi with third-party manifolds. At that time, he has a scar on his left ear from a bullet. ; : : Also known as Black Cat, KN is the informal leader of the were-cats trying to establish a safe place for them. He is always working in the shadows, wearing a trench coat and hat. He first appears on the CIA's radar as a \\"ghost spy\\" in the 1960s for his tendency to disappear quickly. He is connected to the defecting Russian spies Yuri Rastvorov and Viktor Belenko, and works to get his hands on a submarine and a nuclear warhead. He convinced Hiroyuki Kagura of the original Kagura Company to join forces with him against the Japanese government, and tries to do the same with Yoichi Taba. Eventually, though, his comrades turn against him because his plans are too slow and hard to understand, and he is forced to leave Ayagane City for a while. He returns later with about 20 young female were-cats trained in electronic espionage and \\"encourages\\" Taba to run for his life away from Hound. KN also likes to relax watching Trigun episodes on TV. ; : : A female were-cat, Maya looks like a young school girl in human form. Abandoned by Taba as a kitten, she was caught in a crossfire between Kuro-Neko and Kagura Co. ver. 3. Already miserable and near starving to death, she then took a couple of crossbow bolts from Rika Kikushima. KN told her to stand up for herself, and that is when she made the transition to were-cat. From that point, she became one of KN is assistants, turning into a spy against Kagura Co. ver. 4. But, she is still bonded to Taba, and becomes friends with most of the Kagura staff. She is capable of transferring over telephone lines, taking over computers and infiltrating guarded mansions. Generally she doesn't speak in human form, breaking character once to ask Maki and Eiko to save Taba. She is fiercely protective of Taba, and will sleep with him in kitten form. Maya likes \\"Genki Neko\\" (\\"happy cat\\", or \\"Lulu\\" in the U.S. version) brand cat food. She is last seen inside the containment system when Takami is forced to delete all the servers in volume 16. ; : Also, possibly \\"Vashka\\". Vashuka is Kuro-Neko's right-hand woman, carrying out various tasks as required, such as slaughtering guards at the Shin-Nihon Avionics plant, or going to Russia to obtain a nuclear warhead. In human form she is a tall, thin, athletic woman with long wavy blond hair, usually wearing light-colored suits and dark sunglasses. She is a vicious unarmed fighter and cool under pressure. Her name was given to her by Hiroyuki Kagura, who said that it was a popular name for cats in the U.S.S.R. ; : Socks is a tall, blonde, gentle woman in human form that cares for kittens abandoned at the shrine near Taba's old apartment, and seems to have helped raise for Maya at some point. She gets captured by Hound early on in the series, but is released after her memories have been wiped and attempts to kill both Maya and Taba. She is finally defeated by Taki. ; : A scruffy guy with glasses in human form, Taki initially is one of KN's minions, carrying out various armed assaults against humans. He does switch over to the anti-KN faction after becoming disillusioned, but when one of the anti-KN assassins tries to kill Taba, he leaves them as well. Taki had been one of the abandoned cats that Socks had given Maya to care for, and he is bonded to Maya as a result, and to Taba by association. ; : : Yajima is the typical grizzled veteran combat leader with the buzz cut and lean, muscled body. Equally at home flying a helicopter as when launching a TOW. When not in the battlefield, he is shown living in the Hounds barracks. ; : : Yoda is a big, beefy guy with a scraggly mustache. He is often seen leading his men into various fights, or when arguing with Yuka Kikushima over who is getting into whose way. Like Yajima, Yoda apparently lives in the Hounds barracks and has no personal life outside it. ; : : Ayumi is the only woman shown within the otherwise all-male forces. She is medium height, trim, with long black hair. Initially, she is very clumsy and does poorly in calisthenics. After meeting Taba and going on a couple of dates, she gains confidence and turns into a master-class sniper. She also lives within the Hounds grounds and has little personal life outside it. However, she apparently does has an off-premises apartment. She falls in love with Taba and they do have sex in volume 15. In vol. 16 she is shown secretly providing covering fire for Taba as he runs for his life from Irie's black ops squad. ; : Older daughter of Hiroyuki Kagura and Chieko Kikushima. Tall, thin, dark haired, and a big fan of horror novels, Yuma is the secret leader of Dept. 2, and the person that determines the fate of each instance of Kagura Company. She gives Irie his marching orders, and has been known to supply Yuka with newer versions of the containment software. She and Rika (i.e., Yuka) were members of Kagura Co. ver. 3, along with Luger Ryuu and two unnamed women. When Ryuu got too close to Kuro-Neko, Yuma had the two women killed, and told Ryuu to stay away from Maki once Umezaki joined ver. 4. When Ryuu broke that agreement, Yuma had the plane he was on blown up in mid-air. When Taba, Maki and Eiko discover the island that Chieko is still living on with a number of young female were-cats, Yuma orders the island bombed, and Kagura Co. ver. 4 to be framed for killing a cop and kidnapping a young girl (i.e., Maya). Yuma does allow Yuka to be a member of Kagura ver. 5 if she forgets everyone that she had been working with, and then focuses on deciding how to create the next variant of the company. ; : : As with all members of Dept. 2, \\"Irie\\" is a fake name. There have been two others before him that served his function of carrying out Yuma Kikushima's commands. In the first few volumes, he mostly just sits in a car and observes Hound, the were-cats and Kagura Co. for Yuma. Later, he commands the Hounds forces himself from a control center in the basement of the Ministry building, as well as calling up Yuka to hire Kagura Co. to assist in recovering the stolen Russian nuke. Finally, he and 4 other goons are the ones sent out to erase Kagura Co. ver. 4 for having reached the were-cat island and learning the truth of the Kagura secrets. ; : A thin, dour-faced, reserved woman with black hair, Kotoi finds herself assigned to bodyguard Irie against an assassination commissioned by a Hounds manager that is tired of Irie's insubordination. After successfully protecting her assignment, and receiving several broken ribs because of it, Kotoi continues to follow Irie around from volumes 12 to 15. While she won't go against her orders, she does not hide the fact that she really doesn't like him. Media The majority of the story is told in the 16 volumes of the Geobreeders manga, which is broken up into parts 1 and 2. Itou attempted to start up Part 3 in 2009, but reportedly fell ill after 3 chapters appeared in Monthly OURsLITE, and stopped writing entirely. However, a sidestory set between volumes 5 and 6, Atomic Attack, describes how Vashuka gets the warhead that is featured in volume 6. And the OAV Get Back the Kitty tells the battle between Hound, Kagura, the CIA and the two were-cat factions as Kuro-Neko attempts to smuggle the warhead into Japan, and the anti-KN faction tries to take it for itself. The 4-part Breakthrough OAV is a sidestory used to introduce Blue Shooting Star, and chronologically occurs some time prior to volume 8. In addition, 4 soundtrack drama CDs were produced as enactments of the first chapters of the manga.

A string bog or strong mire is a bog consisting of slightly elevated ridges and islands, with woody plants, alternating with flat, wet sedge mat areas. String bogs occur on slightly sloping surfaces, with the ridges at right angles to the direction of water flow. They are an example of patterned vegetation. Known as \\"aapa\\" moore (from Finnish aapasuo) or strangemoore in Northern Europe. A string bog has a pattern of narrow (2‚Äì3m wide), low (<1m high) ridges oriented at right angles to the direction of drainage with wet depressions or pools occurring between the ridges. The water and peat are very low in nutrients because the water has been derived from other ombrotrophic wetlands, which receive all of their water and nutrients from precipitation, rather than from streams or springs. The peat thickness is >1m. String bogs are features associated with periglacial climates, where the temperature results in long periods of subzero temperatures.

In a sit-down with Tony, both Johnny and Phil make threats against his blood relations. Johnny says he wants Tony B \\"on a fucking spit.\\" Tony B, in hiding, calls Tony to apologize. Tony tells him not to come back and says he will look after his sons. He further admits why he was not at the hijack where Tony B was arrested decades earlier, saying that he has always felt guilty; \\"Now we're even.\\" Ending the call, they tell each other to take care. Tony has the call traced. His cousin is in upstate New York, near their uncle's now-empty house. Tony and Johnny meet alone. Tony says he knows where Tony B is, and what has to be done. Johnny refuses to let Tony handle it himself, and further refuses to promise that it will be quick. Tony then refuses to give up Tony B's location and the meeting ends in antagonism. Tony punishes Christopher for bungling a cigarette smuggling operation. Back home, Chris rants about Tony's treatment of him and what he sees as his favoritism towards Tony B. Adriana, stressed, is diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. When FBI surveillance of Adriana's nightclub catches her behaving oddly with a bag of garbage, she is brought in. She admits that she was cleaning up after a murder was committed in her office at the club: drug dealer Matush Giamona killed a customer who claimed he had been ripped off. Threatened with imprisonment for covering up the murder, Adriana is told she has to wear a wire. She refuses, but persuades the FBI that Chris is ready to turn. They let her go, with a deadline for bringing him in. When Adriana tells Chris she has been talking to the FBI, he reacts violently and begins to strangle her before he breaks down crying. They eventually agree to flee and start a new life. However, while getting gas for his Hummer H2 the next morning, he thoughtfully watches a poor family in front of the gas station, their meager possessions strapped to the roof of a run- down car. Adriana receives a call from Tony. He tells her that Chris has tried to kill himself but is alright; Silvio will come to take her to the hospital. But he drives her to an area of deserted woodland, turns off the road onto a track, then stops. He drags her out of the car. As she crawls away, crying, he shoots and kills her off screen. Chris dumps a suitcase of her belongings in a riverside dumping ground and puts her car in long-term parking at the airport. At the Bada Bing, Tony sees that Chris is doped on heroin; Chris says the pain is too much. Tony loses control and beats him up, saying Chris is not the only one with pain. Tony and Carmela negotiate over her desire to build a house on spec in partnership with her father. Tony agrees to pay $600,000 for the land. He promises that his \\"midlife crisis will no longer intrude any more\\" into their marriage. The couple are reconciled and he moves back in. Tony goes to see Valentina in the hospital and breaks up with her. Deceased * Gilbert Nieves: stabbed to death by Matush Giomana (in flashback). * Adriana La Cerva: shot by Silvio Dante for being an informant to the FBI. Additionally, Billy Leotardo murder by Tony Blundetto, previously mentioned only, is shown in Phil Leotardo's flashback. Title reference * Christopher parks Adriana's car in the \\"Long Term Parking\\" section at the airport. * \\"Long term parking\\" could refer to a long-term decision, or putting oneself in a lasting or binding situation: Adriana suggesting she and Christopher join the Witness Protection Program; Carmela and Tony moving back in together; Tony B.'s attempts to disappear; and Christopher's and Tony's guilt over the death of Adriana. * The title could refer to the state of Christopher's soul, which could be forever damned for his betrayal of Adriana * When Adriana is picked up by the FBI outside the pharmacy, she mentions that her car is still in the parking lot. Production * Many fans speculated that Adriana had survived because her death was not shown on-screen. However, Drea de Matteo confirmed in her 2005 DVD commentary that Adriana was indeed killed. De Matteo quotes Van Zandt as saying: \\"Do [the fans] think I was shooting squirrels?\\" Later in the DVD commentary, de Matteo talks about the strong fan reaction to Adriana's death. *In 2014, during an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit, de Matteo stated: \\"All of us had known already that my character was dying - [Steven] Van Zandt was actually the most pissed off about it, he didn't want to do it, he just didn't want to do it. And I had to talk him into how awesome it was gonna be and how important it was, he didn't want to pull me out of that car, he didn't want to call me a c-word, he didn't want to shoot me in the head, but David [Chase] made a specific point not to show my character actually getting the bullet to her head. I'm not sure if that was for cliffhangers reasons, but he said it was from respect for the character.\\" * de Matteo and Michael Imperioli asked David Chase to cut out the scene where Christopher tells Tony about Adriana in order to keep her death at the hands of Silvio a surprise.

An OVA series was released in 2003, with three sets of episodes. Two years later, a new OVA series was released, named \\"Guardian Hearts - Power Up\\". Brief summary A guardian heart by the name of Hina accidentally reveals herself to a boy. The two then begin living together. As the story progresses, more girls begin living with them for the same reason. Characters ; Voiced by: Takahiro Sakurai The male protagonist of the show. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, he discovers the secrets and identities of a number of girls throughout the series. The first girl being the Guardian Heart, Hina, and to keep her identity secret he has no choice but to let her live with him. To make matters more interesting, every girl whose secret or identity he discovers also comes to live with him and Hina. ; Voiced by: Rie Kugimiya One of the main female characters. She is a Guardian Heart, a protector of the peace and well-being of an assigned planet, who must always keep her identity a secret. Hina is sent to Earth as a last chance to redeem her previous failures at keeping her identity a secret (said to be equal to a record). This fails spectacularly as Kazuya witnesses her arrival (thus setting a new record for the fastest that a Guardian Heart's identity has been found out). She asks Kazuya to let her live with him (since he has seen her naked) so that they can pretend to be a family and so her allow her to stay, since family members are exempt from the keeping her identity secret requirement. Kazuya's mother who arrives on the scene a little later agrees to this arrangement over his strenuous objections. In addition to her duties she also has to complete tests given by her superiors so that she can stay on Earth. She loves Kazuya and pushes the other girls away when she feels they're getting too close to him. ; Voiced by: Haruna Ikezawa One of the main female characters. She is a princess from a magical world who came to Earth looking for a husband who is also secretly a magical girl. After her accidental meeting with Kazuya she becomes convinced that he is fated to become her husband, especially since Kazuya found out her true identity. She is very obsessed with Kazuya and constantly daydreams about him. She hates the Guardian Heart for always preventing her from getting close to Kazuya and is unaware that Hina is the Guardian Heart. ; Voiced by: Kae Araki One of the main female characters. She is known as \\"Black Maya\\" by her ninja clan. Although she is a runaway ninja (for reasons unknown), she still calls herself a ninja from her clan and upholds the clan traditions. One of these traditions is to keep their identity secret, and kill anyone who knows their identity. Kazuya finds out about her identity as a ninja when he discovers her ninja tools. She attempts to kill Kazuya but Hina intervenes and they face off. Kazuya helps Maya escape from Hina, saving her life. Since ninjas of Maya's clan must always repay their debts she also comes to live with him, looking for the opportunity to repay the favor. Initially she hates Kazuya, especially since according to her clan's traditions she has no choice but to become his wife (because not only has he seen her naked twice, he has also kissed her twice). As the story progresses, she warms up to him as she realizes he is reliable and kind. Consequently, she comes to believe that Kazuya is fated to be her husband, although she has difficulty in expressing her feelings. She hates the Guardian Heart for beating her in their fight. ; Voiced by: Kyouku Tsuruno One of the main female characters. Kurusu is an alien who comes from a planet whose people have the power to use the skills and powers shown by the clothes they are wearing (mostly uniforms), and so she always cosplays. She fell in love with Kazuya at first glance, since she immediately confessed her identity to him on their meeting for the first time, but their conversation was interrupted by Guardian Heart. She also hates the Guardian Heart for interrupting her confession to Kazuya. She also lives with Kazuya. ; Voiced by: Hisayo Mochizuki One of the female characters that lives together with Kazuya. She is a miko (priestess) from the planet Karutei, and so she can sense spiritual power and also exorcise spirits. Her reason for staying with Kazuya is unknown, but she apparently lives with him when the rest of the girls starting living with him as well. She loves to eat, and can digest foodstuffs that are deadly to humans. ; Voiced by: Mayumi Shintani A female talking cat who started living at Kazuya's house but is closer to his mother than him. She gets along with Kazuya and the girls, except Chelsea whom she started teasing even before she started living with Kazuya (for some reason). She encourages all of the girls except Chelsea to become closer to Kazuya. When her ear is pulled three times she turns into a big monster which just looks like a Godzilla-sized white cat. ; Tori A yellow bird, who can transform into a girl. Her true identity is unknown, but she apparently has the power to transform Kazuya into a heroic figure. She is the only character who cares for everyone's well-being and doesn't take sides. She is also the narrator in the series.

It has hard, rough \\"ironbark\\" from its trunk to small branches, linear to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, nine or eleven, white flowers and cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical fruit. A variable species, it grows in woodland and forest from the Cape York Peninsula to near Sydney. It is an important source of nectar in the honey industry and its hard, strong timber is used in construction.flower budsfruithabit in coastal Central Queensland. Description Eucalyptus crebra is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has persistent thick, rough, deeply furrowed, greyish black \\"ironbark\\" from the base of its trunk to the small branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have linear to lance-shaped or curved leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are linear to lance- shaped, the same dull green to greyish colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven, usually on a branching inflorescence on the ends of branchlets. Each group is carried on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are club-shaped, spindle-shaped, or diamond-shaped to oval, long and wide and green to yellow with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus crebra was first formally described in Journal and Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany by Victorian state botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective crebra meaning \\"thick\\", \\"close\\" or \\"numerous\\", referring to the species' abundance. Narrow-leaved ironbark has included several species, including E. drepanophylla and E. xanthoclada but these are regarded as synonyms by the Australian Plant Census. Eucalyptus repanophylla is accepted as a separate species by the Queensland Government. Other similar species include E. exilipes, E. granitica, E. staigeriana, E. quadricostata and E. whitei. Distribution and habitat The narrow-leaved ironbark grows in sandy soils in woodland and forest from Picton, southwest of Sydney, north through New South Wales and Queensland to the vicinity of Cairns. Uses The tree has a hard, strong, and dark red timber, which has been used for sleepers and construction. A plank has been recorded as being used for Elizabeth Farm, Australia's oldest surviving European dwelling. It is used as a shade tree or to line roadways, and is also available as a cultivar. It is useful in honey production as the flowers are heavy in nectar and pollen; the resulting honey produced by bees is light-coloured and delicately flavoured.

This has implications for any kind of test or assay, including diagnostic tests in medicine, and can be a cause of false positives. In immunology, the definition of cross-reactivity refers specifically to the reaction of the immune system to antigens. There can be cross-reactivity between the immune system and the antigens of two different pathogens, or between one pathogen and proteins on non-pathogens, which in some cases can be the cause of allergies.  In medical testing  In medical tests, including rapid diagnostic tests, cross- reactivity can be either confounding or helpful, depending on the instance. An example of confounding that yields a false positive error is in a latex fixation test when agglutination occurs with another antigen rather than the antigen of interest. An example of helpful cross-reactivity is in heterophile antibody tests, which detect Epstein-Barr virus using antibodies with specificity for other antigens. Cross-reactivity is also a commonly evaluated parameter for the validation of immune and protein binding based assays such as ELISA and RIA. In this case it is normally quantified by comparing the assays response to a range of similar analytes and expressed as a percentage. In practice, calibration curves are produced using fixed concentration ranges for a selection of related compounds and the midpoints (IC50) of the calibration curves are calculated and compared. The figure then provides an estimate of the response of the assay to possible interfering compounds relative to the target analyte.  Applications in drug development  Tissue cross-reactivity assay is a standard method based on immunohistochemistry, required prior to phase I human studies for therapeutic antibodies. In drug screening, because many urine drug screens use immunoassays there is a certain amount of cross-reactivity. Certain drugs or other chemicals can give a false positive for another category of drug.  In immunology  In immunology, cross-reactivity has a more narrow meaning of the reaction between an antibody and an antigen that differs from the immunogen. It is sometimes also referred to as crossimmunity or cross-protective immunity, although cross-reactivity does not necessarily infer cross- protection. In some cases, the cross-reactivity can be destructive, and immune response to one pathogen can interfere with or lower the immune response to a different pathogen. An adaptive immune response is specific to the antigen that stimulated it (called the immunogen). However, many naturally occurring apparent antigens are actually a mixture of macromolecules (for example, from pathogens, toxins, proteins, or pollen) comprising several epitopes. Contact with a complex antigen such as a virus will stimulate multiple immune responses to the virus' different macromolecules as well as the individual epitopes of each macromolecule. For example, the tetanus toxin is a single protein macromolecular antigen but will stimulate many immune responses due to the tertiary structure of the protein yielding many different epitopes. The toxin that creates the immune response will have an epitope on it that stimulates the response. Denaturing the protein may 'disarm' its function but allow the immune system to have an immune response thus creating an immunity without harming the patient. Cross reactivity has implications for flu vaccination because of the large number of strains of flu, as antigens produced in response to one strain may confer protection to different strains. Cross-reactivity need not be between closely related viruses, however; for example, there is cross-reactivity between influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells and hepatitis C virus antigens.  Allergies  Cross reactivity may also occur between a pathogen and a protein found on a non-pathogen (i.e. food.) There may even be cross reactivity between two non-pathogens; for example, Hevein-like protein domains are a possible cause for allergen cross- reactivity between latex and banana. Cross-reactivity may be caused by identical carbohydrate structures on unrelated proteins from the same or different species. Such cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) are an issue in allergy diagnosis, where about a fifth of all patients displays IgE antibodies against Asn-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycans) containing core Œ±1,3-linked fucose. As CCDs apparently do not elicit allergic symptoms, a positive in vitro test based on IgE binding to CCDs must be rated as false positive.

Then she learns that her parents are considering a divorce and she may have to make the heartrending choice of deciding which parent to live with. On top of that, Hiromi's tutor, Keisuke (on whom Hiromi has a crush), is getting married, and Hiromi fears that she soon will be completely alone. She finds herself comforted by Junkers, an unusual dog with the ability to speak and grant her three wishes. The film, directed by Junichi Sato of Sailor Moon fame and shown in small chunks on Japanese TV before being released theatrically, was based on a story by singer-songwriter Naoto Kine, a member of TM Network. He also performed the film's opening song and acted in the film as Shintaro, Hiromi's father. The late Kazuo Komatsubara also worked on the film as a character designer and animation director.

Early life and career Romeo Bragato was born fourth in a family of ten children to Giuseppe and Paolina Bragato on 26 February 1859 in the harbor town of Lussinpiccolo now Mali Losinj on the Adriatic island of Lussin (now Losinj). At that time it was part of the Austrian Empire but is now part of Croatia. His mother Paolina (n√©e Depangher) was Austrian from Vienna. Bragato's early education was at Pirano (Piran) south of Trieste on Istria and at a technical school there. According to his family, Bragato then trained as an architect in Vienna and from 1879-1883 attended the Regia Scuola di Viticoltura ed Enelogia in Conegliano in the heart of the Veneto wine region. Bragato graduated in 1883 and returned to Lussinpiccolo where for a year he was an oenologist at the Provincial Association of Agriculture and later from 1 January 1885 until 1888 viticulturist and cellar master for the Jerolimic brothers.  Time in Australia  Bragato arrived in Melbourne in Victoria, Australia on the Hohenzollen on 31 August 1888. On 19 September before the Royal Commission on Vegetable Products he outlined a scheme of education and development for the Victorian wine industry. He visited the Rutherglen district and met with the vine growers there. He worked the 1889 vintage voluntarily with Hans Irvine at Great Western where he made 10,000 gallons of wine. In November, 1889, he was appointed the Colonial Government's Viticultural Expert and began to tour vineyards, publishing reports in the Board of Viticulture's Journal. For ten years the affable and popular Bragato was Victoria's wine expert providing support for the emerging industry along with protective tariffs, planting bonuses and other incentives. But with fellow junior experts Giovanni Federli and Francois de Castella dismissed in retrenchments following economic downturn in 1892 only Bragato remained to advise the legion of newcomer vignerons brought in on a wave of enthusiasm for the industry and with the promise of bonuses for new plantings. Bragato's advocacy was conducted in situ and accompanied by field demonstrations of planting and pruning. He typically recommended growers plant Shiraz (Syrah) mixed with Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps also Malbec or Mataro (Mouvedre). The mainly British derived population of the Australian colonies were not yet wine drinkers in the European manner, so Bragato anticipated the produce of these vines would be mainly for export. Fortunately, the rich, soft dry red wine produced by the warmer Australian areas and known as Australian Burgundy suited the English market. Its competitors were not the fine red wines of Burgundy but equivalent hot and warmer climate styles from South of France, Algeria and other New World locations. Domestic consumers would later enjoy the fruits of Bragato's advice. Bragato was also sensitive to differences of climate and terroir and brought his Italian derived tastes into play. At southerly and similarly cool Geelong recommending Shiraz, Cabernet, Dolcetto and Pinot Noir in the reds with White Hermitage (Marsanne], Riesling and Pineau Blanc (Chardonnay) in the whites. Bragato championed new regions, assisting vignerons in the Avoca and Moonambel district now known as the Pyrenees (Victoria). Other vineyards that Bragato encouraged, such as Dawson's Glenlinton at Whittlesea continued producing fine wines for a generation or more afterwards, the taste and memory of which helped to seed revival of the wine industry in Victoria in the post 1945-era. Bragato was an early advocate of a viticultural and wine making college for Victoria. The idea languished in the economically depressed years of the early 1890s. But was pushed to a conclusion at Rutherglen after 1894 when the rival Bendigo vineyards were discovered to be infested with phylloxera. They were subsequently destroyed under the Victorian government‚Äôs draconian eradicationist policies enacted with agreement from the other wine growing colonies of South Australia and New South Wales. Working with the Victorian Public Works Department, Bragato designed a model winery and cellars attached to the Rutherglen Viticultural College, which opened in 1897 on 1,000 acres of land to the south of Rutherglen. Bragato was bitterly disappointed when passed over as principal of the College. He then considered his situation intolerable when placed subordinate to a new choice of expert imported to tackle Phylloxera, the 26-year old Montpellier-trained Frenchman Raymond Dubois. By 1897 Bragato was openly claiming that ‚ÄúPhylloxera will never be eradicated from Victoria and that our experience will very likely be like that of France, Spain, Italy and other vine growing countries in Europe.‚Äù By this stage he had joined forces with international opinion and was an advocating the importation of Phylloxera-resistant American vines and planting on the rootstocks. Considerable resistance remained from established vignerons to American vines and official policy still favoured the eradication of affected vineyards. When Phylloxera was discovered in Rutherglen vineyards in 1899 the Minister for Agriculture, J.W Taverner, forced Bragato's resignation. It was widely accepted that Bragato was made the scapegoat for Phylloxera. Eradicationist policy was effectively abandoned after the Rutherglen outbreak. It was seen subsequently as a factor in the destruction of Victoria's nineteenth century wine industry, which had been the most extensive of the Australian colonies. Time in New Zealand In New Zealand the 1894 Flax and Other Industries Committee recommended the establishment of a Department of Agriculture. The committee received considerable lobbying from the developing wine industry. As a consequence of this lobbying, Premier Richard Seddon requested the loan of the services of Romeo Bragato from the Victorian Government in 1895. Bragato arrived in Bluff, and was escorted by government officials to assess prospects for viticulture and wine making in New Zealand. His resulting report ‚ÄòProspects of Viticulture in New Zealand‚Äô submitted to the Premier on 10th Sept, was very positive and became important in promoting the development of the young wine industry. His report recommended: * regions suitable for viticulture * formation of district associations * importation of phylloxera resistant vines for grafting In 1897, Mr. W.J. Palmer, Government Pomologist, planted grapes at the Waerenga (Te Kauwhata) Experimental Station, including: Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay, Syrah, Riesling, Pinot blanc and Malbec In 1898, Bragato returned to New Zealand and identifies phylloxera in the Auckland vineyards of Mr Dridgman and Mr Harding of Mt Eden Road, Auckland. He recommended importation of phylloxera resistant cuttings from Europe to counter phylloxera In 1901, Bragato returned to report on the presence of phylloxera, persuading the Government to import phylloxera resistant vines and rootstocks from California and France. He also visits Waerenga Experimental Station In 1902, Bragato accepts the post offered the previous year as Government Viticulturist for the New Zealand Department of Agriculture. In this role Bragato: * imports disease resistant stocks distributing them for grafting * begins experimental winemaking at the expanded Waerenga Station * takes control of government vineyards in Hawkes Bay and Tauranga * organises field days for growers and prospective growers at Waerenga In 1906, Bragato published ‚ÄòViticulture in New Zealand‚Äô In 1908, five wines from the Te Kauwhata Experimental Station won gold medals at the Franco- British wine exhibition. Despite this success official support for the Division of Viticulture began to wither due to the growth of the Temperance Movement The Viticultural Division of the Department of Agriculture was disbanded in 1909 and Romeo Bragato, frustrated and disillusioned, leaves New Zealand. Later life In 1912 he and his family, wife Laura and daughter Miriam, left New Zealand for Canada. Bragato died in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 13 December 1913, from natural causes.

Story The series is set within the Meiji period of Japan, following a small boy named Hiwou. The townspeople have lived simply, making \\"Clockwork Dolls\\" or \\"karakuri\\" for festivals. Hiwou's father left the family on a long trip, and their mother has since died. The children live with friends. Their simple life vanishes when the \\"Wind Gang\\" appears, destroys the city with their own clockwork dolls, and captures its citizens. Hiw≈ç and his siblings and friends, Shishi, Machi, Tetsu, Mayu, Sai, and baby Jyobu (who are exploring a cave at the time), escape unharmed and embark on a quest to save the town. They take with them Homura, a huge clockwork doll that functions like a giant robot. Along the way, they are forced to use their clockwork dolls as weapons - something they were never supposed to do, according to Hiw≈ç's father. Early in the series, they meet Arashi, a member of the Wind Gang, and Hana and Yuki, two samurai daughters who ended up traveling with the group. Hiw≈ç and his friends encounter a number of historical figures, before these people entered the history books during the Meiji Restoration.

The state park's include of shoreline, diverse forested dune and swale complexes, wetlands, camping areas, and many miles of hiking trails. The state park is operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which has, as of 2006, approved a proposal that be officially dedicated as a wilderness area. Wilderness State Park was designated a Michigan \\"dark sky preserve\\" in 2012. Description The location of Waugoshance Point and Wilderness State Park One of the most prominent physical features of the park is Waugoshance Point, which juts westward into northern Lake Michigan. Beyond the tip of the point, Temperance Island and Waugoshance Island are also parts of the state park. Four Lake Michigan lighthouses sit near the park's western boundary. Stations at Grays Reef, Skillagalee Island, Waugoshance, and White Shoal warn shipping away from the dangerous reefs and shoals of Waugoshance Point. History The state began acquiring the park's lands in 1896 through purchase and tax reversion proceedings. After the reversion of additional acreage for tax nonpayment in the early years of the twentieth century, the site became the Emmet State Game Refuge in 1922, with the land set aside for the breeding of game birds and other animals. When the game reserve was placed under the administration of the Parks Division in 1927, it officially became Wilderness State Park. The Civilian Conservation Corps was active in the park for six years during the 1930s. The corps' workers built various structures, eight miles of trails, a public campground, and four-acre Goose Pond. Wildlife The park supports populations of many animals that are part of the traditional image of the northern Great Lakes ecosystem, including American black bear, beaver, bobcats, mink, muskrats, and otter. The park's cobble beach areas provide an excellent habitat for the federally endangered piping plover. As of 2002, approximately one-third of Michigan's nesting pairs of piping plovers were found in Wilderness State Park. One of the first sightings of wolves in the Lower Peninsula was reported along the park's shoreline by a Coast Guard pilot in 1997. In 2015, MDNR officials confirmed the presence of wolves in the Lower Peninsula. Activities and amenities Wilderness State Park Campground The state park offers swimming, picnicking, boat launch, fishing, a 250-site campground and cabins. The state park contains of trails for hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, that include a section of the North Country Trail.

Work  He revived the interest in Celtic neopaganism and Druidry in the 20th century. Nichols was a Member and Chairman of the Ancient Druid Order which traces its lineage to a meeting at the Apple Tree Tavern in Covent Garden, London, in 1717' although Professor Ronald Hutton has demonstrated that it only dates back to 1906, the 1717 story being a modification of the founding of modern Freemasonry. His main work, The Book of Druidry, was published posthumously in 1990.  Life  Philip Peter Ross Nichols was born in Norwich, England,http://www.druidry.org/about-us/ross- nichols-founder/ross-nichols-chronology and educated at Bloxham School. While a graduate history student at Cambridge University, Nichols became influenced by the work of James George Frazer, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, T.S. Eliot, Robert Graves and Jessie Weston among others.http://www.druidry.org/about- us/ross-nichols-founder He worked in journalism, teaching and social work through the Great Depression, and became a committed socialist and pacifist, favoring for the rest of his life the new economic theories of C.H. Douglas, whose concept of Social Credit advocated a total reform of the monetary system to make it more equitable. Ross was also a vegetarian and naturist, joining Britain's first naturist community, Spielplatz, near St. Albans in Hertfordshire, in the 1930s. In 1939, Nichols became principal of a private college in London, while staying at Spielplatz during time off. It is assumed that on one of these trips he met and befriended Gerald Gardner.http://www.druidry.org/about-us/ross-nichols-founder Later, Nichols was asked to edit Gardner's seminal work, Witchcraft Today. Between 1941 and 1947, four of his poetry books were published, including an essay in The Cosmic Shape (1946) focusing on the power of myth and the value of seasonal celebration. Two were published by Fortune Press - 'Prose Chants and Proems' (1942) and 'Sassenach Stray (1942). In 1949, Ross was hired as assistant editor of The Occult Observer, a short lived publication by Michael Houghton of the Atlantis Bookshop. It was an important step as it marked the first time Nichols wrote about Druidism and also fellow author Mir Bashir wrote a story in it entitled The ‚ÄòBook of Shadows‚Äô inspiring Gardner to adopt the term for Wicca. While Gardner worked to introduce Wicca to the modern world, Nichols worked to change the practice of modern Druidry. He introduced a concern for Celtic mythology and Bardcraft, and the celebration of the full eight seasonal ceremonies in addition to arranging the teachings into three grades, in accordance with classical accounts of the three divisions of the Druids. Nichols also edited, published and arranged the translation of Jean Baptiste's (aka Paul Christian) book \\"The History and Practice of Magic\\" in 1969. In 1988 one of his students, Philip Carr-Gomm, was asked to lead the Order.

The village is situated near the confluence of the Po River and the Tanaro river. Main sights include remains of the castle, dating to Lombard times, and a Romanesque pieve (10th century) with 12th century Byzantine frescoes. Entry gate with coat of arms History The first inhabitants of whom there is written news belonged to the Ligurian tribe of the Marici: they had crossed the Pennine in the postglacial era and had settled south of the Po river, in the area between Stradella and Casale Monferrato. Such people were closely linked to that of the Levi, who had settled further north: the founding of Ticinum, the modern Pavia, is attributed to the Levi and to the Marici. Some toponomastic traces of that period exist in the area: Bosco Marengo stems from Lucus Maricum and Pietra Marazzi from Petra Maricorum or Mariciorum. In the 6th century BC the Po valley was occupied by Celtic peoples coming from the north and realistically also Bassignana had contacts and compenetrations with these peoples. In 222 BC the Roman commanders Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Gneus Cornelius Scipio conquered the whole area, which conquest was strengthened by the defeat of the Ligures in 166 BC under the consulate of Gaius Sulpicius Gallus. The toponym of the municipality dates back to that era, coming from the Roman family to whom ownership of the territory was attributed, the gens Bassinia. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the barbaric incursions, Bassignana was first under the rule of the Lombards, then under that of the Franks. In the 10th century, the emperor Otto II attributed Bassignana to the jurisdiction of the bishop of Pavia, Pietro, a jurisdiction relating to the Pieve (plebs) and to the assets connected thereto.The attribution was granted through an imperial diploma dated 22 November 976. At the beginning of the 13th century the area was placed - still following the Emperor's order - under the jurisdiction of the Margrave Pallavicino, already podest√† of Alessandria. In 1350 it became part of the Duchy of Milan. After the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), it was assigned to the House of Savoy-Piedmont. Many of its inhabitants emigrated to Memphis, in the United States, at the start of the 20th century.

His inventions contributed to the rotary engine and the helicopter. His son was the pilot for the first successful British helicopter flight in 1938. Cyril Pullin died in 1973 aged 80. Early life Cyril George Pullin was born 1892 in Wandsworth, London. He became a well known motorcycle racer and in 1914 won the Isle of Man TT race. Racing career 1915 Rudge Multi TT 500cc In 1914 Cyril Pullin won the Isle of Man TT with a record average of 49.49 mph on a Rudge Multi which had a variable belt drive gearbox giving an effective option of over 20 speeds which made a huge difference on the hills. The race, which ran for over four hours was led by Oliver Godfrey (riding an Indian) and Howard R Davies (on a Sunbeam) who dead heated for second place when Pullin overtook them both to win by only 6.4 seconds. Pullin's success on the day was sadly marred when fellow competitor in the Junior TT Frank Walker came round the final corner on his Royal Enfield to find the road blocked by people trying to see the finish. He did his best to avoid injuring spectators but was killed in the crash. Following the tragedy the organisers of the TT introduced rope barriers and crowd control. On 23 March 1922 at Brooklands Pullin established a new record and became the first ever British motorcyclist to be timed at over 100 m.p.h. on a 3 hp Douglas 500cc motorcycle. Inventions In the 1920s Pullin developed various helicopter engine patents and in the 1940s he developed the Powerwheel, a rotary engine in the hub of a motorcycle wheel, a rotating single-cylinder engine known as a one-lunger. This consisted of just the cylinder and a clutch which could be engaged and disengaged, with a simple drum brake. The invention never entered production but is credited as an important step in rotary engine development. His sister was married to Stephen Leslie Bailey, a then prominent engineer at Douglas Motorcycles and many of his patents were filed under the name of that company. Car and motorcycle business In 1928 Pullin took over the former Phoenix factory in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, to produce Ascot- Pullin Motorcycles and the Ascot car based on the Hungarian Fejes, with chassis and 10 hp engine assembled from welded steel pressings. It never went into production. A larger car, the Ascot Gold Cup Six with a 2423 cc six- cylinder engine possibly made by Continental, three-speed gearbox and servo brakes did become a reality and a few production cars were made. It was advertised as being available as a two-seat sports, coup√© or fabric saloon. Rotary wing aircraft In 1932 Pullin joined G & J Weir Ltd's aircraft department, in Glasgow, Scotland, as chief designer to develop single-place autogyros. Pullin and his team designed a series of Autogiros before moving on to a small helicopter using two rotors mounted atop outriggers each side of the fuselage. The Weir W.5 was a single-seat helicopter powered by an air- cooled engine, and established a maximum airspeed of 70 mph. Its two two- blade, fixed-pitch rotors had swashplate-actuated cyclic control. The W.5 made its first flight at Dalrymple, Ayrshire, on 7 June 1938, when it was piloted by Raymond Pullin and it became the first British helicopter to fly successfully. By World War II the W.5 had logged eighty hours' flying time and was followed by a scaled-up version, the W.6, which was the first two-seater helicopter in the world, powered by a much more powerful DH Gipsy aero engine. Further progress on this model was prevented by World War II. Pullin designed the 1500 cc \\"Flat Twin\\" and the \\"4-Cylinder\\"(later called Pixie when licensed to Aero Engines Ltd of Bristol) engines which followed it.

The concept, originally proposed in 2001, as AB501,Alliance Oct. 12 Newsletter limited the classification to towns with over 7,500 people. The proposal has gained support from such organizations as the Wisconsin Towns Association.Wisconsin Towns Association Home Page The impetus that originally spawned the concept of urban towns was an effort to stem annexation of urbanized areas in unincorporated area by cities and villages across county lines. Obtaining \\"urban town\\" status effectively freezes the town's boundaries. While urban towns would have substantially greater zoning and regulatory rights than \\"rural towns\\", the status would not confer \\"incorporated\\" status on the municipality, freeing them from several responsibilities incumbent upon incorporated municipal governments, thus distinguishing them from the incorporated towns of Illinois. In the time since the idea was originally proposed, many of the towns that would have been affected have since incorporated, but 2004 population estimates indicate that a number of towns that would have been ineligible in 2001, now are.

She wrote many books on occult and esoteric subjects, and was dubbed \\"Britain's most famous witch\\" by the BBC. Personal life Sybil Leek was born on 22 February 1917 in the village of Normacot in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England to a comfortable, middle-class family. She claimed to have been descended from the historical Molly Leigh, who had been accused during the witch hunts. in her book The Complete Art of Witchcraft, pg 21, she calls this 800 year family beneficial relationship with 'our ancient Celtic form of Witchcraft' and occultism. At the age of 16 she married her music teacher, though he died two years later, whereupon Leek returned to live with her grandmother, quitting the Witchcraft research association. She later stayed with an acquaintance in Lyndhurst, in the New Forest, and claimed to have spent some of the following years living amongst the New Forest gypsies. When she was 20, Sybil returned to her family, who had now moved to the edge of the New Forest. She opened three antique shops; one in Ringwood, one in Somerset, and one in the New Forest village of Burley. She soon moved to Burley herself, into a house behind the shop Lawfords of Burley. Her eccentric habits as a self-described witch soon resulted in problems. Many of her detractors failed to understand that Sybil's Celtic Witchcraft is not derived from Gardnerian Wiccan practice though she would use the form if it suited her. Media interest grew, and Sybil became tired of the attention from news reporters and tourists. According to a contemporary, \\"People either thought she was a bit of a joke or a fraud.\\" Although the village itself benefited from the extra tourism and visitors, some were unhappy with the extra traffic and noise. Her landlord eventually refused to renew her lease, prompting Leek to move away from the area and emigrate to the United States of America. United States When Leek moved to America, she became an astrologer, describing astrology as her \\"first love\\".Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Judika Iles, p. 746 In April 1964, an American publishing house wanted Sybil to speak about her new book A Shop in the High Street, and she was invited to appear on To Tell the Truth, a TV programme in the States; her appearance occurred on 13 April 1964. She took the opportunity to go, and flew to New York City, where she gave many interviews. While in New York, she was contacted by Hans Holzer, a parapsychologist, who invited her to join him investigating hauntings and psychic phenomena. They went on to do numerous TV and radio programmes on the subject. She would later move to Los Angeles, where she met Israel Regardie, an authority on Kabbalah and ritual magic. Views Strong in the defence of her beliefs, Leek sometimes differed and even quarrelled with other witches. She disapproved of nudity in rituals, a requirement in some reconstructed traditions, and was strongly against the use of drugs, but she was at odds with most other witches in that she did believe in cursing. She also claimed to have had an out-of-body experience. Her student Christine Jones stated that Leek \\"mixed truths with untruths liberally, causing great harm as she went.\\" Death She died of cancer on 26 October 1982 at the Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, Florida.

Background Olive Ann Burns was born in Banks County, Georgia. Her father was a farmer but was forced to sell his farm in 1931 during the Great Depression. The Burns family then moved to Commerce, Georgia. Burns attended Mercer University, where she wrote for the college magazine. Her sophomore year she transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she majored in journalism. Career Burns worked for the Atlanta Journal and wrote under the pseudonym \\"Amy Larkin\\". She married Andy Sparks, a fellow journalist. In 1971 Burns began writing down family stories as dictated by her parents. In 1975 she was diagnosed with lymphoma and began to change the family stories into a novel that would later become Cold Sassy Tree. The novel was finally published eight years after it was begun, in 1984. Burns received so many letters pleading for a follow-up novel that she began writing Leaving Cold Sassy. Burns died of heart failure in 1990, at age 65, in a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, before finishing the manuscript, and the uncompleted novel was published in 1992 along with her notes.

Lahainaluna High School is also a public boarding school. It was founded in 1831 as a Protestant missionary school, originally named Lahainaluna Seminary. The early missionaries who arrived in Lahaina in 1823 explained to the Hawaiian Royalty the importance of an educational institution in the American style. A number of the pioneers, students and teachers are buried in a small graveyard behind several buildings on the campus. It was the first formal European-American style school founded in Hawaii and has continued to operate to this day. History and traditions American William Richards founded the missionary station in Lahaina in 1823. In June 1831, Lorrin Andrews was chosen as first principal of a seminary for boys and young men. The site was named Lahainaluna for \\"upper Lahaina\\". On September 5, 1831, classes began in thatched huts with 25 Hawaiian young men as students, including former royal historian David Malo. The second principal was William Patterson Alexander 1843‚Äì1856. The school eventually became part of the public school system in Hawaii. The post-secondary program later became developed as part of the first University of Hawaii. Lahainaluna has a boarding program where students from the outer islands (including students from the \\"other side of the island\\") can live and study at either of the campus dormitories. In return, they do various jobs around the campus, such as maintaining the landscape, tending to the farm animals, and making student meals at the cafeteria; they work 18 hours per week. Initially and exclusively for males, the boarding program became coed in 1980. The two dorms are David Malo Dormitory for the boys and Hoapili Dormitory for the girls. Previously, Hoapili housed both genders. Lahainaluna is one of very few public boarding schools in the nation. There is an 30-ft \\"L\\" on the mountain-side overlooking Lahaina at the 2,000 ft elevation mark. The \\"L\\" stands for Lahainaluna and has been there since 1904. Twice a year, the boarders at Lahainaluna lay a fresh coat of white lime on Pu'u Pa'u Pa'u. The boarding students must carry 50 lb sacks of lime to the site, clear the weeds, and clean up the site. Added to the \\"L\\" are embellishments of the year and athletic championships for the previous year. On a clear day, the freshly limed L can be seen from the island of Molokai. It is located at coordinates . Lime is used because it's natural and does not interfere with the ecosystem. After the students have completed restoring the \\"L\\", they lay fresh leis at David Malo's gravesite, chant, sing and pray. Historically, on graduation day alumni hike up the \\"L\\" and light up torches that line the \\"L\\" to symbolize the graduates have received their diplomas. The school celebrates David Malo Day annually. That day a feast is served and the Hawaiiana Club puts on a performance. Hale Pai Front page of 1834 student newspaper Hale Pa'i, or the house of printing, is a small coral and timber building on the Lahainaluna campus that, starting in 1834, served as the home of Hawaii's first printing press. English and Hawaiian language Bibles, books and newspapers were printed here, including the first newspaper printed west of the Rocky Mountains. The first paper currency of Hawaii was printed here in 1843. A student was expelled in 1844 for counterfeiting, which resulted in the government re-issuing all the paper money with secret marks. A map of the islands on the one dollar bill, ho'okahi dala, printed in 1843 at the school press Many archived publications are on public display at the site, now a museum maintained by the Lahaina Restoration Foundation.\\"Hale Pa'i\\" Story by Rita Goldman, Maui No Ka 'Oi Magazine Vol. 12, No. 3 (May 2008) . Hale Pa'i, also known as Hawaii Site No. 50-03-1596, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Campus Lahainaluna High School is located on the side of an extinct volcano. The multiple classroom buildings are widespread. The grounds are covered with many benches, pathways, grass, plants and trees, the latter providing shade. The ceramic sculpture Orbit by Toshiko Takaezu is located here. A small stream runs near the school, past the Agriculture area. Lahainaluna is high enough on this volcano to allow views of the Pacific and of the islands of Moloka'i, Lana'i and Kaho'olawe. It is considered one of the best views from any school in the islands. It has a boarding facility available.

It was the first satellite of five Atmosphere Explorers.  Technical specifications  Explorer 17 was a spin-stabilized sphere 0.95 m in diameter. The spacecraft was vacuum sealed in order to prevent contamination of the local atmosphere. Explorer 17 carried four pressure gauges for the measurement of total neutral particle density, two mass spectrometers for the measurement of certain neutral particle concentrations, and two electrostatic probes for ion concentration and electron temperature measurements. Battery power failed on July 10, 1963. Three of the four pressure gauges and both electrostatic probes operated normally. One spectrometer malfunctioned, and the other operated intermittently. The successful launch and operating of Explorer 17 allowed scientists for the first time to obtain instantaneous atmospheric density measurements using several independent measuring systems, to measure the atmosphere during a single day under nearly constant local time conditions and geomagnetic activity, and to compare direct measurements of density with those inferred from measurements of perturbations in the satellite period orbit.

It has been speculated that these may refer to San Pedro de Montes, San Fiz de Viso√±a, San Juan de Poyo, respectively. In Baetica, he established a monastery at the Island of C√°diz and one called Nono (location unknown). At Nono, he attracted such a number of monks that the local dux complained to the king that he had lost too much of his military levy. His monastery at Compludo was known for its unusually severe Rule. In this monastery, monks were required to reveal all their thoughts, visions and dreams to their superiors. They were subjected to bedtime inspections throughout the night. Monks were forbidden to look at each other. Punishments here were also unusually harsh and included flogging and imprisonment within the monastery on a diet of six ounces of bread for three to six months.Roger Collins, Early Medieval Spain. (New York: St Martin's Press, 1995), p. 84. His relationship with the kings of his time was not always a happy one. In 652, he wrote what was apparently a second letter to King Recceswinth asking for the release of political prisoners held from the reign of King Chintila, some of whom had languished in prison until the reign of King Erwig. Bishop Saint Fructuosus as Archbishop of Braga He was later present at the Eighth Council of Toledo in 653, in place of Bishop Riccimer of Dumio. It was at this Council that Fructuosus raised the issue of political prisoners once again. After the death of Bishop Riccimer, Fructuosus succeeded him in the See of Dumio in 654. In 656, he undertook to plan for a voyage to the Levant. However, according to the new laws enacted by King Chindasvinth, it was illegal to leave the kingdom without royal permission. One of the few disciples privy to his plans had given him up to authorities and Fructuosus was subsequently arrested and imprisoned. Bishop Fructuosus attended the Tenth Council of Toledo in December 656. The last will and testament of the recently deceased bishop Riccimer, was disputed by those who saw his freeing of slaves and distribution of church rents to the poor was responsible for the subsequent impoverishment of that see. The Council agreed that, by not providing compensation, Bishop Riccimer had obviated his duty and the acts of his will were rendered invalid. They gave the job of correcting the problem to Fructuosus and commanded him to take moderation in the case of the slaves. At the same Council, Archbishop Potamius of Braga was remanded to a monastery for licentiousness and his archdiocese was given to St Fructuosus on 1 December 656. J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XI (Florence: A. Zatta 1765), pp. 40-41, 43. Fructuosus dressed so poorly as to be mistaken for a slave and he even received a beating from a peasant, from which he was only saved by a miracle (according to the monastic chroniclers). His Vita is one of the chief sources for writing the history of his age. From the 16th to the mid 20th century the authorship of the Vita Fructuosi was wrongly attributed to Valerio of Bierzo.Francis Clark, (2003), The \\"Gregorian\\" dialogues and the origins of Benedictine monasticism, page 353.

St Fructuosus' feast day is observed on 16 April. His relics, which for a time were in the Cathedral of Braga, were later transferred to the Shrine of Santiago de Compostela in the year 1102. They were returned to their original location in 1966. Fructuosus is depicted with a stag, which was devoted to him, because he had saved it from hunters. Notes Sources *Thompson, E.A.

In the reign of Alfonso I of Asturias (739‚Äì757), through a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors, the Christians had retaken Galicia, La Rioja, and Le√≥n and brought the population of the northern regions firmly under their control. This left those provinces largely empty of human settlement and created a buffer zone between Moors and Christians. This region was called the Desert of the Duero. This zone was left untouched for almost a century while Alfonso's successors focused their energies on Vasconia and Galicia. It was during the reign of Ordo√±o I of Asturias (850‚Äì866) that the repopulation of the uninhabited zone began. Ordo√±o began advancing to the south, repopulating the cities of Tui, Astorga, Le√≥n, and Amaya. The people who descended the mountains of the north for the uninhabited valleys were called foramontanos, meaning \\"out of the mountains.\\" Among the routes the foramontanos took was that between Cabu√©rniga and Campo de Suso, which was followed as early as 824, when the new population of Bra√±osera received the oldest known fuero in Spanish history. The desire for newer, more fertile agricultural zones in the river valleys of the Ebro and Duero was the chief driving factor in the emigrations. From this time the kingdom increasingly became known as that of Le√≥n and in 910, on the death of Ordo√±o's son, Alfonso III, the kingdom was divided with Fruela II continuing to reign in the Asturias while his brothers Garc√≠a and Ordo√±o ruled in Le√≥n and Galicia respectively. The repoblaci√≥n was then complete. Anyway, the so-called Desert of the Duero was never completely depopulated, since archaeological research has shown the continuity of occupations, so what probably happened was that those areas within the \\"Desert\\" were no longer subject to the domain of any type of government, kingdom or lord, during that period. The Portuguese Repovoa√ß√£o occurred during the reigns of the House of Burgundy up to the middle of the thirteenth century.

It is so called because it is the center of the nine-point circle, a circle that passes through nine significant points of the triangle: the midpoints of the three edges, the feet of the three altitudes, and the points halfway between the orthocenter and each of the three vertices. The nine-point center is listed as point X(5) in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers..Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, accessed 2014-10-23. Properties The nine-point center N lies on the Euler line of its triangle, at the midpoint between that triangle's orthocenter H and circumcenter O. The centroid G also lies on the same line, 2/3 of the way from the orthocenter to the circumcenter, so :NO=NH=3NG. Thus, if any two of these four triangle centers are known, the positions of the other two may be determined from them. Andrew Guinand proved in 1984, as part of what is now known as Euler's triangle determination problem, that if the positions of these centers are given for an unknown triangle, then the incenter of the triangle lies within the orthocentroidal circle (the circle having the segment from the centroid to the orthocenter as its diameter). The only point inside this circle that cannot be the incenter is the nine-point center, and every other interior point of the circle is the incenter of a unique triangle....Franzsen, William N. \\"The distance from the incenter to the Euler line\\", Forum Geometricorum 11, 2011, 231-236. http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2011volume11/FG201126index.html The distance from the nine-point center to the incenter I satisfies :IN < \\\\tfrac{1}{2}IO, :IN=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(R-2r) < \\\\frac{R}{2}, :2R\\\\cdot IN=OI^2, where R and r are the circumradius and inradius respectively. The nine-point center is the circumcenter of the medial triangle of the given triangle, the circumcenter of the orthic triangle of the given triangle, and the circumcenter of the Euler triangle.. More generally it is the circumcenter of any triangle defined from three of the nine points defining the nine-point circle. The nine-point center lies at the centroid of four points: the triangle's three vertices and its orthocenter.The Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers credits this observation to Randy Hutson, 2011. The Euler lines of the four triangles formed by an orthocentric system (a set of four points such that each is the orthocenter of the triangle with vertices at the other three points) are concurrent at the nine-point center common to all of the triangles.Altshiller-Court, Nathan, College Geometry, Dover Publications, 2007 (orig. Barnes & Noble 1952). Of the nine points defining the nine-point circle, the three midpoints of line segments between the vertices and the orthocenter are reflections of the triangle's midpoints about its nine-point center. Thus, the nine-point center forms the center of a point reflection that maps the medial triangle to the Euler triangle, and vice versa. According to Lester's theorem, the nine-point center lies on a common circle with three other points: the two Fermat points and the circumcenter.. The Kosnita point of a triangle, a triangle center associated with Kosnita's theorem, is the isogonal conjugate of the nine-point center.. Coordinates Trilinear coordinates for the nine-point center are : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\cos(B-C) : \\\\cos(C-A) : \\\\cos(A-B) \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\cos A+2\\\\cos B \\\\cos C:\\\\cos B+2\\\\cos C \\\\cos A:\\\\cos C+2\\\\cos A\\\\cos B \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\cos A-2\\\\sin B \\\\sin C:\\\\cos B-2\\\\sin C\\\\sin A:\\\\cos C-2\\\\sin A\\\\sin B \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & bc[a^2(b^2+c^2)-(b^2-c^2)^2]:ca[b^2(c^2+a^2)-(c^2-a^2)^2]:ab[c^2(a^2+b^2)-(a^2-b^2)^2]. \\\\end{align} The barycentric coordinates of the nine-point center are : \\\\begin{align} & a\\\\cos(B-C):b\\\\cos (C-A):c\\\\cos (A-B) \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & a^2(b^2+c^2)-(b^2-c^2)^2:b^2(c^2+a^2)-(c^2-a^2)^2:c^2(a^2+b^2)-(a^2-b^2)^2. \\\\end{align} Thus if and only if two of the vertex angles differ from each other by more than 90¬∞, one of the barycentric coordinates is negative and so the nine-point center is outside the triangle.

She is best known for being a vocalist and guitarist of alternative rock band Veruca Salt, which she co-founded with Nina Gordon in 1992. Early life Post was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents got divorced when she was nine years old. She began playing the piano at age seven, and participated in several musicals in high school. At age 16, Post founded an R&B; band with her brother Eric. She later joined a funk cover band, which played at proms, college dances and bars. Post wrote her first song at age 16, inspired by Vanity 6. She performed a different song, also written by her, in a talent show, which she described as, \\"really, really bad, and I don't think I wrote another song until I was in college\\". She also stated: \\"I was desperate to express myself creatively and poetry filled that need, but songwriting was more satisfying, more gratifying and more fun\\". After graduating from Clayton High School, she moved to New York City and attended Barnard College. There, she joined an a cappella singing group. Post began playing guitar in her sophomore year of college, and after graduating with a major in English, went back to St. Louis. She then moved to Chicago, Illinois, and was unsure of which career to follow. There, she joined a theatre company, and was inclined to either become an actress or a musician. Musical career Shortly after meeting Nina Gordon, the two founded alternative rock band Veruca Salt in 1993, with addition of drummer Jim Shapiro, Gordon's brother, and bassist Steve Lack. Veruca Salt released a self-funded demo tape and shopped it to labels while playing a handful of small club shows. After a few live concerts, the band was signed to Minty Fresh Records and began recording with producer Brad Wood, at the time popular for having produced Liz Phair's critically acclaimed album Exile in Guyville (1993). The band released a 7-inch single for the song \\"Seether\\", and later, their first full-length album, American Thighs on September 27, 1994, and re-released on November 8, 1994 by Geffen Records. The album peaked on the Billboard Top 20 at 69, and was eventually certified Gold. Other singles of the album included \\"All Hail Me\\" and \\"Number One Blind\\". To support the album, the band begin touring as the opening acts for bands such as Hole, Live and PJ Harvey. In 1996, Veruca Salt released an EP, Blow It Out Your Ass It's Veruca Salt, produced by Steve Albini. The group entered the studio with producer Bob Rock in 1997. Their second album, Eight Arms to Hold You, was released on February 11, 1997, and contained the hit \\"Volcano Girls\\", which was the opening theme for dark comedy film Jawbreaker. Another single, \\"Shutterbug\\", was performed by the band on Saturday Night Live. In 1998, Gordon left the band and Post recruited new members. They then released another album, Resolver (2000). The new band's line-up toured in Summer 2001 and promoted the album in the United Kingdom. Resolver was released in Australia in 2003 and promoted with both a tour and the release of a tour EP, Officially Dead, in 2003. In 2005, the band toured Australia and the band's line-up was once again renewed, and released another EP, Lords of Sounds and Lesser Things, followed by a full-length album, IV (2006). In 2007, the group covered Neil Young's song \\"Burned\\" for a breast cancer benefit album. In 2012, the band's hiatus was announced on their official website. In 2013, Veruca Salt announced the reunion of its original line-up on their Facebook page; on September 29, 2013, it was announced that they were working on new material, set to be released in 2014. On April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day, the band released a 10-inch vinyl disc, MMXIV, containing two new songs, \\"It's Holy\\" and \\"The Museum of Broken Relationships\\". In 2014, the band played several dates in the United States and Australia. The first post-reunion Veruca Salt album, Ghost Notes, was released on July 10, 2015 to favorable reviews. Post appeared on Ken Reid's TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on August 7, 2015 and revealed that Veruca Salt were approached to host a FOX comedy variety show in the 90s. Personal life Post and bandmate Nina Gordon were very close friends for much of Veruca Salt's original years. By the late 1990s, the personal disagreements between the two increased, resulting in the departure of Gordon from the band. Veruca Salt's 2000 album, Resolver, the first one released without Gordon, contains lyrics that have been interpreted as \\"hostile\\" towards her; however, they never explained the reasons behind their falling out publicly. In 2003, Post stated that the two had reconciled and were friends, but \\"not at the same intensity\\". In October 2006, Post complimented Gordon's solo career. In 2013, it was announced that Gordon had returned to Veruca Salt, with Post referring to her as \\"[her] best friend\\". In the late 1990s, Post was in a relationship with Foo Fighters's leader and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Gordon has said that the Foo Fighters song \\"Everlong\\" (on which Post sang backing vocals, recorded over a telephone line from Chicago to Los Angeles) is about Post. Following their break-up, Post, during an inebriated performance in Melbourne in 1997, stated that Grohl had left her for Winona Ryder, which was later believed to be referred in Veruca Salt's song \\"Disconnected\\", which contains the lyrics: \\"It's kind of scary when your lover leaves you for a movie star\\". In 2006, Post stated: \\"It was a private relationship, but it got so much publicity. I didn't mean for it to happen. I'm friends with him now.\\" Post began dating The Brontosaur's frontman, musician Tony Parks, in 2001. The couple wed on March 30, 2008 in Las Vegas and have one daughter, Lila (born April 28, 2010). In October 2017, Post was one of 38 women who publicly accused film director James Toback of sexual harassment. That number later grew to nearly 400.

Unlike many Indo- Europeanists, who work entirely on the basis of written materials, he conducted extensive fieldwork on lesser-known Indo-European languages and dialects, such as Albanian, Arb√´resh and Arvanitika; Breton; Welsh; Irish; Resian and Scots Gaelic. His wide-ranging interests also included American Indian languages. He served for many years as editor of the International Journal of American Linguistics and did field work on Quileute and Ojibwa. He also studied linguistic aspects of braille.Hamp, Eric, et al., Four Analytic Studies of the American Literary Braille Code, American Printing House for the Blind, 1995. Hamp's scholarship was characterized by the densely argued, narrowly focused note, essay and review, generally consisting of a few pages. He wrote more than 3,500 articles and reviews, and nearly every important aspect of historical linguistics was dealt with, often multiple times, in Hamp's writings.

Growing up in East Orange, New Jersey, Hamp was sent to the Tome School in 1935 and entered Amherst College in the fall of 1938. He received his BA from Amherst, majoring in Greek and Latin, in 1942. Hamp was still a British subject during the early years of World War II, and he spent the period immediately after college as a purchasing agent for the Union of South Africa under Lend-Lease, which provided U.S. war materiel to the Allies. He then became a U.S. citizen and served in the U.S. Army, being discharged in 1947 at the rank of sergeant. Hamp resumed his studies in 1947, entering the Department of Comparative Philology at Harvard University (the department was renamed the Department of Linguistics in 1951), from which he received an MA (1948) and PhD (1954). Among Hamp's teachers at Harvard were Joshua Whatmough and Kenneth H. Jackson.Meckler, Michael, \\"Eric P. Hamp: 16 November 1920 - 17 February 2019,\\" North American Journal of Celtic Studies 3.2 (Autumn 2019): 201-209, contains further information on Hamp's life. Career Hamp became interested in Albanian while in graduate school at Harvard, and he traveled to southern Italy to do field work among the Arb√´resh√´ people, an Albanian ethnolinguistic group in southern Italy. It was in Italy in 1950 that he received an invitation to join the faculty of the University of Chicago as a lecturer in Linguistics. Hamp spent his entire academic career on the University of Chicago faculty, being promoted to assistant professor in 1953, associate professor in 1958 and full professor in 1962. He retired from teaching in 1991. At Chicago, he was the Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Department of Linguistics, where he served as chair from 1966 to 1969. Hamp also held appointments at the University of Chicago in the departments of Psychology and Slavic Languages and Literatures, as well as in the Committee on the Ancient Mediterranean World. He served as director for the Center for Balkan and Slavic Studies from 1965 to 1991. He was a visiting fellow and faculty member at a number of institutions throughout the world, including the University of Michigan; the University of Wisconsin; the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; the University of Edinburgh; and the Luigj Gurakuqi University of Shkod√´r, Albania. In 1960, he held the Hermann and Klara H. Collitz Professorship for Comparative Philology at the Linguistic Society of America Summer Institute at the University of Texas. Hamp was a prodigious lecturer, and among the invited talks he has given were the Rudolf Thurneysen Memorial Lecture at the University of Bonn and the James W. Poultney Lecture at Johns Hopkins University.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media and airs a soft adult contemporary radio format. The studios and offices are on Kings Road in Schenectady. WPBZ-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 6,000 watts, with its transmitter off Smultz Road in Glenmont, New York.Radio-Locator.com/WPBZ-FM History Early years On December 1, 1972, the station signed on as WQBK-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1988 page B-196 It was owned by the People Communications Corporation and was the FM simulcast of WQBK (now WGDJ). WQBK was a daytimer, required to go off the air at night. WQBK-FM was able to continue the AM station's middle of the road programming after dark for listeners with FM radios. Progressive rock In the early 1970s, some FM stations around the country were experimenting with Free Form music hosted by youthful disc jockeys. By early 1975, WQBK-FM began to air progressive rock, starting each afternoon at 4 p.m., with the earlier hours of the day still being a simulcast of WQBK. The rock music proved popular and WQBK-FM flipped to a full-time progressive rock format in August 1975. The original broadcast day was 7 a.m.-1 a.m., with WQBK-FM signing off overnight. The station began promoting itself as WQBK-FM... The Progressive 104. Two years later, WQBK-FM debuted the simpler Q104 branding for the station. In 1980, former beautiful music station WHSH switched to a new format as WPYX, a more mainstream album rock format that only played the biggest selling albums. WPYX also had a full power signal while WQBK-FM was a Class A station, limited to only 3,000 watts. As a result, WQBK-FM saw its ratings slip. In 1984, the original owners sold the station, along with co-owned WQBK AM 1300, to Dick Berkson. Berkson tweaked WQBK-FM's format with its wide-ranging playlist to a more mainstream format with elements of the Big Chill rock (which had a heavy lean on 1960s hits). WQBK-FM was rebranded as The New QBK FM 104 with the slogan \\"The Rock That Matters.\\" Classic rock The Big Chill format didn't catch on. In 1987, the station relaunched as a more mainstream classic rock outlet, returning to the Q104 branding. During this period, the programming was harder-edged classic rock with a limited amount of current songs, mainly new material from core artists of the time. In 1988, WQBK/WQBK-FM were sold to Albany Broadcasting. In 1992, WQBK-FM began carrying the syndicated Howard Stern Show from New York City. Stern's show proved to be very popular in the Capital District, unseating the previous top morning show, WGY's Don Weeks, for the next thirteen years. WQBK-FM was limited by its Class A signal that was hard to hear outside Albany, Schenectady, Troy and their close-in suburbs. In 1994, Albany Broadcasting acquired WSHQ...changing the call letters to WQBJ, an FM station at 103.5 MHz in Cobleskill, with a full Class B signal, running 50,000 watts. WQBJ could reach communities that were outside WQBK-FM's range, especially to the west of Albany. Modern rock One year later, the stations flipped to mainstream rock and rebranded as 103.5/103.9 The Edge, placed between classic rock WPYX and active rock WZRQ. However, the mainstream rock format only lasted a short time. After several months of faltering ratings, the stations flipped to modern rock, which made the stations a success in the Albany market within a year (scoring in the top 5 ratings and #1 18-34 spot), thanks to the combination of modern rock and Howard Stern. In 1996, Radio Enterprises acquired Maximum Media (then-owners of WQBK-FM, WQBJ, and WQBK). Two years later, Clear Channel Communications purchased Radio Enterprises, and increased voice-tracking and automation at the station as well as leaning towards harder-edged songs. Return to active rock The stations returned officially to active rock on September 17, 1999. Two weeks later, former sister station WHRL flipped to modern rock to fill the void left by WQBK-FM and WQBJ's switch to a harder rock presentation. When AMFM merged with Clear Channel in 2000, Clear Channel had to divest some of its properties because it was over its limit of stations in some media markets such as Albany. WQBK-FM/WQBJ and WTMM (the former WQBK) were then sold to Regent Communications (now Townsquare Media). Shortly after, Regent tweaked the format to a more mainstream active rock direction, and eventually included some alternative rock in the playlist. In December 2005, Howard Stern moved to Sirius Satellite Radio, causing a drop in the ratings for \\"The Edge.\\" On the morning of December 16, 2005, The Edge format was flipped to album-oriented rock, changing the station's moniker to Q103 and the slogan Where Rock Lives, also used on WNEW-FM in New York City. As a replacement for Howard Stern, The Free Beer and Hot Wings Show debuted as WQBK-FM/WQBJ's morning show (based at co-owned WGRD-FM in Grand Rapids, Michigan). (The Edge name was later revived on Pamal Broadcasting's active rock station WZMR.) During this time, WQBK- FM/WQBJ were positioned between WPYX and WZMR in terms of music playlist. Two years later, the stations again returned to active rock, using slogans such as Relentless Rock and Go Rock Yourself to promote the new format. The stations began to climb back up the ratings. Like the former Edge, the stations had an alternative lean, although most modern rock songs played on the stations were found on both the modern and active rock charts. A year later, WHRL flipped to active rock. By the end of 2010, WQBK-FM/WQBJ was the only Active Rock radio station remaining in the Albany market, as WZMR had changed to country music and WHRL began simulcasting talk radio WGY. Mediabase and Arbitron began listing WQBK-FM/WQBJ as active rock stations, while Nielsen BDS put WQBK- FM/WQBJ on the mainstream rock panel as of 2012. On September 2, 2011, WKLI-FM flipped from variety hits to active rock adding new competition in the Albany market. However, WQBK-FM/WQBJ still leaned more alternative than its competitor. WKLI's rock format lasted only two years, as in October 2013, WKLI flipped from active rock to country music, leaving WQBK-FM/WQBJ as the only active rock radio station in the Albany area once again. By 2017, WQBK-FM/WQBJ had evolved back to a classic rock format so as to compete with WPYX, but with a more '80s and '90s based format. The stations used the slogan Classic Rock Redefined. Soft AC On July 1, 2019, WQBK-FM and WQBJ dropped the \\"Q103\\" rock format, which was moved to co-owned WQSH. WQBK-FM and WQBJ then began stunting, directing listeners to tune to WQSH, as WQBK-FM and WQBJ planned to take on new formats.Q103 Albany Moves to 105.7 Radioinsight - July 1, 2019 Until July 2019, WQBK-FM had been longest-running commercial rock music station in the Albany radio market, predating WPYX by five years. At the time of the format's move to WQSH, WQBK-FM's DJ line-up included The Free Beer and Hot Wings Show, Candace, Tigman, Vinnie and Nights with Alice Cooper. On August 1, 2019, WQBK-FM ended stunting and launched a soft adult contemporary format, branded as \\"103.9 The Breeze\\", putting the station in competition with Pamal Broadcasting's WROW and WYJB. WQBJ, in turn, ended its WQBK-FM simulcast after 26 years and took WQSH's former alternative rock format as \\"Alt 103.5.\\"Alt 103.5 and 103.9 The Breeze Debut in Albany Radioinsight - August 1, 2019 On August 9, 2019, WQBK-FM changed its call sign to WPBZ-FM to match the \\"Breeze\\" branding. Radio-locator.com - August 23, 2019 The WQBK call letters were then moved to 105.7...and the WQSH call letters were moved to 103.5... On November 1, 2019, WPBZ-FM flipped to Christmas music, beating out long-time Christmas music stations WYJB-FM and WTRY-FM in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy market for the 2019 holiday season. EdgeTV For a brief period in 2000, WQBK-FM/WQBJ had an association with startup cable-only UPN network affiliate WEDG-TV. The cable TV channel used \\"EdgeTV\\" branding and a variant of the radio station's logo as its on-air logo. After WQBK-FM and WQBJ were taken over by Regent Communications, the cable TV station changed its name to \\"UPN 4.\\" It ended in 2003 when UPN signed up a new over-the-air affiliate, WNYA.

It is native to the Conasauga River and Etowah River in Georgia and Tennessee in the United States. It typically inhabits riffle areas over gravel and sand bottoms, hiding in aquatic vegetation when present. It feeds on small invertebrates and probably breeds between late fall and early spring. It is an uncommon fish with a small range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified its conservation status as being \\"endangered\\". Description The amber darter is typically less than in length and has a slender body. It has dark saddle-like markings on its golden brown upper body while the belly is a yellow-to-cream color. Breeding males have blue throats. Ecology While there is little data available about the breeding habits of the amber darter, what information is available suggests that it spawns from late fall to early spring. The amber darter likely lives up to 3 years. Its diet consists mainly of snails and insects. The amber darter inhabits the Coosa River system, living in the Conasauga and Etowah rivers of northern Georgia and southeastern Tennessee. In these rivers, it prefers to inhabit riffle areas over gravel substrate and sand. During the summer, when aquatic vegetation grows in the rivers, the amber darter feeds in the vegetation and uses it for cover. Status A proposed reservoir may put the survival of the amber darter at risk by altering water and habitat quality in the amber darter's downstream habitat. Because of the amber darter's limited distribution, practically any activity that could degrade habitat or water quality, such as logging, chemical spills, or construction could threaten the existence of the amber darter. Conservation efforts focus on habitat preservation. It is an uncommon fish with a small range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified its conservation status as being \\"endangered\\".

They distinguished themselves in 1949 as winners of the inaugural FDGB-Pokal, the East German Cup. History The club was founded in July 1905 as FC Adler and in October of that year merged with the football department of the church youth group Jugendvereins zu St. Johannis to become Dessauer FC. After World War I, in February 1919, this club joined Sportlichen Vereinigung BAMAG Dessau to form VfR Dessau 1905, and two years later a union with SpVgg Dessau created SV Dessau 05. In 1935, after the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich, Dessau played in the Gauliga Mitte, one of sixteen new upper class divisions. The club quickly emerged as a strong side, capturing three division titles from 1937 to 1939, finishing second the next two seasons, and then winning another three consecutive titles from 1942 to 1944. However, Dessau was never able to achieve any kind of success in the subsequent playoff rounds of the national championships, making it past the preliminary rounds only once in six attempts. In 1942, the team advanced as far as the quarterfinals of the Tschammerpokal, predecessor of today's German Cup. After World War II most organizations in Germany, including sports associations and football clubs, were dissolved by the occupying Allied authorities. The club was re-formed in late 1945 as Blau-Weiss Dessau. As was typical in Soviet occupied East Germany the club would undergo a number of name changes: Sport-Union Dessau (1947); SG Dessau-Nord (1948); BSG Waggonbau Dessau (1949); BSG Waggonfabrik Dessau (August 1949); and BSG Motor Dessau (February 1950). It was as Waggonbau Dessau that the club defeated BSG Gera- S√ºd 1:0 to capture the East German Cup, the most significant honour in their history. From 1949 to 1954 Dessau played in the top-flight DDR-Oberliga where their best result was a third-place finish in their first year of play at that level. After falling from the top division the club played for the most part as a second division side until 1967 when they slipped further to Bezirksliga Halle (III) where they played until the start of the 1980s. In 1989 they abandoned the name Motor Dessau to play as SV Waggonbau Dessau, and in 1995 re-claimed the name SV Dessau 05. In the early 2000s Dessau played most of their football in the fifth tier Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt, interrupted by two one-season stints in the NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd in 2004‚Äì05 and 2006‚Äì07. In 2009 it dropped down to the Landesliga but won promotion back up to the Verbandsliga in 2014 where it plays today.Das deutsche Fu√üball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesSV Dessau 05 at Fussball.de Tables and results of all German football leagues Honours The club's honours: * Gauliga Mitte ** Champions: 1937, 1938, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1944 ** Runners-up: 1940, 1941 * FDGB-Pokal ** Winners: 1949 * Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt (V) ** Champions: 2004, 2006 * Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt S√ºd ** Champions: 2014 ** Runners-up: 2012 References External links *Official team site *The Abseits Guide to German Soccer Category:Football clubs in Germany Category:Football clubs in East Germany Category:Football clubs in Saxony- Anhalt SV Dessau Category:Association football clubs established in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in Germany Category:Works association football clubs in Germany ","title":"SV Dessau 05"},{"id":"4517642","text":"A contour plot of the hours of daylight as a function of latitude and day of the year, using the most accurate models described in this article. It can be seen that the area of constant day and constant night reach up to the polar circles (here labeled \\"Anta. c.\\" and \\"Arct. c.\\"), which is a consequence of the earth's inclination. The sunrise equation can be used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset for any solar declination and latitude in terms of local solar time when sunrise and sunset actually occur. It is: :\\\\cos \\\\omega_\\\\circ = -\\\\tan \\\\phi \\\\times \\\\tan \\\\delta where: :\\\\omega_\\\\circ is the hour angle at either sunrise (when negative value is taken) or sunset (when positive value is taken); :\\\\phi is the latitude of the observer on the Earth; :\\\\delta is the sun declination.  Theory of the equation  The Earth rotates at an angular velocity of 15¬∞/hour. Therefore, the expression \\\\omega_\\\\circ \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{15}^\\\\circ} gives the interval of time before and after local solar noon that sunrise or sunset will occur. The sign convention is typically that the observer latitude \\\\phi is 0 at the equator, positive for the Northern Hemisphere and negative for the Southern Hemisphere, and the solar declination \\\\delta is 0 at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes when the sun is exactly above the equator, positive during the Northern Hemisphere summer and negative during the Northern Hemisphere winter. The expression above is always applicable for latitudes between the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle. North of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, there is at least one day of the year with no sunrise or sunset. Formally, there is a sunrise or sunset when -90^\\\\circ+\\\\delta < \\\\phi < 90^\\\\circ - \\\\delta during the Northern Hemisphere summer, and when -90^\\\\circ - \\\\delta < \\\\phi < 90^\\\\circ + \\\\delta during the Northern Hemisphere winter. For locations outside these latitudes, it is either 24-hour daytime or 24-hour nighttime.  Generalized equation  The equation above neglects the influence of atmospheric refraction (which lifts the solar disc by approximately 0.6¬∞ when it is on the horizon) and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc (about 0.5¬∞). The times of the rising and the setting of the upper solar limb as given in astronomical almanacs correct for this by using the more general equation :\\\\cos \\\\omega_\\\\circ = \\\\dfrac{\\\\sin a - \\\\sin \\\\phi \\\\times \\\\sin \\\\delta}{\\\\cos \\\\phi \\\\times \\\\cos \\\\delta } with the altitude (a) of the center of the solar disc set to about ‚àí0.83¬∞ (or ‚àí50 arcminutes).  Complete calculation on Earth  The generalized equation relies on a number of other variables which need to be calculated before it can itself be calculated. These equations have the solar- earth constants substituted with angular constants expressed in degrees.  Calculate current Julian day  :n = J_{date} - 2451545.0 + 0.0008 where: :n is the number of days since Jan 1st, 2000 12:00. :J_{date} is the Julian date; :2451545.0 is the equivalent Julian year of Julian days for 2000, 1, 1.5, noon. :0.0008 is the fractional Julian Day for leap seconds and terrestrial time. :TT was set to 32.184 sec lagging TAI on 1 January 1958. By 1972, when the leap second was introduced, 10 sec were added. By 1 January 2017, 27 more seconds were added coming to a total of 69.184 sec. 0.0008=69.184 / 86400 without DUT1.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. Its effective radiated power (ERP) is 330 watts, broadcasting from a transmitter near Illinois Mountain in Marlborough, New York, on a tower shared with longtime sister station 107.3 WRWD-FM.Radio- Locator.com/WBWZ Z93 calls itself \\"Today's Classic Rock.\\" It primarily plays harder-edged classic rock titles with some active rock songs from the 1990s and 2000s that are not usually heard on Classic Rock stations. Its main competition is 101.5 WPDH in Poughkeepsie, which also leans to classic rock but not as hard-edged. History WBWZ's construction permit was awarded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1991 to Betty Walker, the mother of then-WRWD owner William H. (\\"Bud\\") Walker. She also owned a local apple orchard. Prior to sign-on, the younger Walker signed an agreement to operate WBWZ with WRWD from the company's studios in Highland. After testing for the first part of December 1992, WBWZ formally signed on the air on December 20, 1992. At first, it carried ABC's \\"Z Rock\\" satellite-delivered hard rock format. The station called itself \\"Z-Rock 93.3.\\" With limited outside promotion and no rock station targeting younger audiences, WBWZ entered the Top 10 of the Poughkeepsie ratings in its first two books. While WBWZ had a loyal audience and good numbers, the Walkers found it hard to sell WBWZ to advertisers, alongside the country music format of WRWD. Coupled with the decline of hard rock and the rise of alternative rock, the Walkers decided Z-Rock 93.3 needed to change its format. In February 1995 the station flipped to a satellite-fed 1970s music format as \\"Z-93.\\" The station had an initial surge of listeners. But then the ratings began to fall again. Shortly after the format change, Bud Walker bought the license of WBWZ after the loosening of FCC regulations, permitting one company to own more than one FM station in a region. In early 1996, Walker decided to leave radio to pursue a career in politics. He sold WBWZ, WRWD, and WWLE to Hudson Valley Radio Partners, a short-term holding company. In November 1996, with the ownership change, WBWZ's format switched to a locally-run Hot Adult Contemporary format while keeping the Z-93 name. Within a month, the station hired morning host Mark Bolger, who had recently exited Top 40 station 104.7 WSPK. His newscaster/co- host Dawn Spicer was also hired. However, their non-compete clauses with WSPK barred them from the air until mid-1997. Shortly after taking the air, Hudson Valley Radio Partners was sold to California-based Roberts Radio. Bolger's presence proved to be key for the station as WBWZ soon saw an increase in the ratings (at its peak being behind only 104.7 WSPK and 101.5 WPDH, both more powerful stations). WBWZ also became #1 in morning drive time. WBWZ added more market veterans and targeted former WSPK listeners. In 2000, Roberts Radio was bought by Clear Channel Communications with Clear Channel taking control that November. Though WBWZ was aided by the elimination of rival 96.1 WCTJ (now WPKF), its ratings soon began to slip to levels not seen since prior to the Hot AC format. After the decline stretched several years, the station's operations were taken over by WPKF program director Jimi Jamm (Jim Collins). On June 30, 2003, Z-93 was replaced by the more CHR-leaning \\"Star 93.3.\\" Bolger remained in mornings, while Dawn Spicer left for WGY in Schenectady in April 2005. In December 2010, Clear Channel replaced Bolger with WPKF Program Director Chris Marino. In 2011, as an economy move, Clear Channel switched many of its Hudson Valley stations to national Premium Choice formats, eliminating local DJs and locally programmed music. On March 14, 2012, at 4 pm, WBWZ changed its format to classic rock, branded as \\"Rock 93.3.\\"Clear Channel Rocks Hudson Valley Radioinsight - March 14, 2012 On July 11, 2012, Gary Cee, formerly of 101.5 WPDH, became the first local DJ on Rock 93.3, hosting middays 10 a.m to 3 p.m. On October 3, 2016, WBWZ rebranded as \\"Z93\\".Rock 93.3 Poughkeepsie Rebrands Radioinsight - October 4, 2016 Previous logo Image:Star933.jpg References External links *Z93 website * Category:Mass media in Ulster County, New York Category:Radio stations established in 1991 BWZ Category:1991 establishments in New York (state) Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WBWZ"},{"id":"4517657","text":"The frontal crest of the frontal bone ends below in a small notch which is converted into a foramen, the foramen cecum (or foramen caecum), by articulation with the ethmoid.

The population of the island is over 300 in the summertime, but the year-round population is only around 40. The year-round population is mostly fishermen who fish the shores for the ever-popular seafood, lobster. Notable locations on the island are the History Museum, which includes a public trail to the shore, the General Store, the school and library, Post Office, Whale's Rib Gift Shop and Crow Island, which is accessible only at low tide. The Ladies' Aid Fair, held each year since 1900 in August, is a highlight of the annual calendar. The island is home to award-winning artist, Wini Smart, who has painted hundreds of oil and watercolor paintings around Great Cranberry Island and the surrounding Mount Desert Island area.

His actions gained international attention, including support from intellectuals such as Albert Camus and Albert Einstein, but ridicule from Eleanor Roosevelt. Davis, a World Federalist, founded the non-profit World Service Authority in 1953 to educate and promote World government. The World Service Authority issues \\"world government documents\\", such as the World Passport, a fantasy travel document based on his interpretation of Article 13(2), Universal Declaration of Human Rights and on the concept of world citizenship. Previously, Davis had worked as a Broadway stage actor and understudy for Danny Kaye. He served as an American bomber pilot in World War II.  Early life  Davis was born in Bar Harbor, Maine (U.S.), to Meyer and Hilda (n√©e Emery) Davis. His parents were Jewish and Irish, respectively. He graduated from The Episcopal Academy in 1940 and attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University).  Career  Davis was a Broadway actor who served as understudy for Danny Kaye and performed for him the musical Let's Face It! He also played a leading role in the Broadway hit Three to Get Ready. Davis served in the U.S. Army during the Second World War as B-17 bomber pilot.  Advocacy for world government  Pained by his own brother's war death and at the death he caused other families by bombing the city of Brandenburg in World War II, and fearful that nuclear war could terminate humanity, Davis gave up U.S. citizenship in 1948 and declared himself a \\"citizen of the world\\". He mentioned Henry Martyn Noel, who had renounced a few months earlier, as one of his inspirations. In France, his \\"Garry Davis Council of Solidarity\\" support committee was co-founded by writers Albert Camus and Andr√© Gide and Emmaus movement originator Abb√© Pierre, as well as Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the French R√©sistance who joined Davis in founding the Mundialization World Cities movement. Davis interrupted a session of the United Nations General Assembly on 19 November 1948, \\"We, the people, want the peace which only a world government can give,\\" he proclaimed. \\"The sovereign states you represent divide us and lead us to the abyss of total war.\\" Along with his support committee, he rallied over 15,000 people in Paris to demand that the UN recognize the rights of Humanity. Eleanor Roosevelt ridiculed his stunts in her My Day column as \\"flash-in-the-pan publicity\\". Davis founded the International Registry of World Citizens in Paris in January 1949, which registered over 750,000 individuals. On 4 September 1953 Davis formed an organisation, the World Government of World Citizens, with the stated aim of furthering fundamental human rights. He additionally formed the World Service Authority in 1954 as the government's executive and administrative agency, which issues its own fantasy passports ‚Äì along with fantasy birth and other certificates ‚Äì to customers. Davis first used his World Passport on a trip to India in 1956, and was allegedly admitted into some countries using it. Davis ran for mayor in Washington, D.C. in 1986 as the candidate of the \\"World Citizen Party\\" receiving 585 votes. He also declared himself as the World Citizen Party candidate for the 1988 US presidential election. Davis published multiple books in favor of his cause of world citizenship. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Davis issued and disbursed a world currency based on kilowatt hours of solar power produced, an idea proposed by Buckminster Fuller. These \\"kilowatt dollars\\" were the earliest documented emissions reduction currency. In March 2012 at age 90, Davis began broadcasting a weekly radio show, \\"World Citizen Radio\\", on the Global Radio Alliance.  Attempts to help Julian Assange and Edward Snowden  In 2012, Davis sent WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a World Passport. Only weeks before he died, Davis sent a World Passport to whistleblower Edward Snowden in Moscow in care of the Russian authorities.  Death  Davis entered hospice care on 18 July 2013, and died six days later in the municipality of South Burlington, Vermont, aged 91. He is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Kristina Starr Davis; two sons, Troy and Kim; and a daughter, Athena Davis from his third marriage; a sister, Ginia Davis Wexler; a brother, Emery; and a granddaughter Emma Meluta.

It is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, specifically one in which antibodies bind red blood cells only at low body temperatures, typically 28‚Äì31 ¬∞C. When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures ( to ), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms. Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause. Cold agglutinin disease was first described in 1957. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of cold agglutinin disease (CAD) are often triggered or made worse by cold temperatures or a viral infection. Therefore, symptoms generally are worse during winter months. Symptoms may arise suddenly leading to abrupt onset of severe anemia and hemoglobinuria or develop more gradually and insidiously in the background without patient's consciousness and precaution. Most people with CAD have symptoms of hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells, causing low levels of red blood cells). However, the number of symptoms and severity of symptoms may depend on how severe the anemia is. Signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia may include: *Tiredness (fatigue) *Dizziness *Headaches *Cold hands and feet *Pale skin *Dark urine *Jaundice *Chest pain *Pain in the back or legs *Vomiting or diarrhea *Heart problems such as an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or heart failure. These may occur because the heart has to work harder to make sure the body gets enough healthy red blood cells. Many people with CAD also experience pain and bluish coloring of the hands and feet (acrocyanosis) or Raynaud's disease. These symptoms result from slow or poor circulation and can range from mild to disabling. Other signs and symptoms of CAD may include enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and mottled discoloration of the skin (livedo reticularis). In people with secondary CAD (associated with another underlying condition), there may be additional signs and symptoms depending on the condition present. For example: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (the most common cause of secondary CAD) may cause respiratory symptoms. Various infections or cancers may cause enlarged or swollen lymph nodes. ;80‚Äì99% of people have these symptoms: *Arthralgia *Autoimmunity *Fatigue *Hemolytic anemia *Muscular weakness *Pallor ;5‚Äì29% of people have these symptoms: *Abnormal urine color *Back pain *Diarrhea *Headache *Hepatomegaly *Lymphadenopathy *Nausea and vomiting *Splenomegaly Cause Cold agglutinin disease can be either primary (unknown cause) or secondary (a result of another pathology/ caused by an underlying condition). Primary cold agglutinin disease The primary form is caused by excessive cell proliferation of B lymphocytes, characterized by clonal lymphoproliferative disorder. Primary cold agglutinin disease occurs after the fifth decade of life and peaks prevalence in a person's 70s and 80s. Secondary cold agglutinin disease Secondary cold agglutinin syndrome occurs when autoantibodies bind to red blood cells, rendering them subject to attack by the complement system. It is a result of an underlying condition potentially associated with either monoclonal cold-reacting autoantibodies or polyclonal cold-reacting autoantibodies predominantly caused by infection or lymphoproliferative disorders. In adults, this is typically due to: *Bacterial infections such as mycoplasma, Legionnaires' disease, syphilis, listeriosis, or E. coli. *Viral infections such Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, mumps, varicella, rubella, adenovirus, HIV, influenza, or hepatitis C. *Parasitic infections such as malaria or trypanosomiasis. *Other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. *Certain types of cancers such as lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi sarcoma. In children, cold agglutinin disease is often secondary to an infection, such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, mononucleosis, and HIV. Inheritance Cold agglutinin disease is not an inherited condition. It is designated as either primary (unknown cause) or secondary (associated with or caused by another condition). In some cases, cold agglutinin may be multifactorial which means that multiple environmental factors and genes likely interact to predispose a person to developing the condition. However, to our knowledge, no disease-causing genes have been identified and no familial cases have been reported. Pathophysiology All individuals have circulating antibodies directed against red blood cells, but their concentrations are often too low to trigger disease (titers under 64 at 4 ¬∞C). In individuals with cold agglutinin disease, these antibodies are in much higher concentrations (titers over 1000 at 4 ¬∞C). At body temperatures of 28‚Äì31 ¬∞C, such as those encountered during winter months, and occasionally at body temperatures of 37 ¬∞C, antibodies (generally IgM) bind to the polysaccharide region of glycoproteins on the surface of red blood cells (typically the I antigen, i antigen, and Pr antigens). Binding of antibodies to red blood cells activates the classical pathway of the complement system. If the complement response is sufficient, red blood cells are damaged by the membrane attack complex, an effector of the complement cascade. In the formation of the membrane attack complex, several complement proteins are inserted into the red blood cell membrane, forming pores that lead to membrane instability and intravascular hemolysis (destruction of the red blood cell within the blood vessels). If the complement response is insufficient to form membrane attack complexes, then extravascular lysis will be favored over intravascular red blood cell lysis. In lieu of the membrane attack complex, complement proteins (particularly C3b and C4b) are deposited on red blood cells. This opsonization enhances the clearance of red blood cell by phagocytes in the liver, spleen, and lungs, a process termed extravascular hemolysis. Individuals with cold agglutinin disease present with signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia. Those with secondary agglutinin disease may also present with an underlying disease, often autoimmune. Diagnosis Detection of antibodies (cold or warm) and /or complement system on RBC from the patient is a direct Coombs antiglobulin test. Detection of antibodies in serum of the patient (still circulating in the blood, that have not yet formed any complexes with RBC) is an indirect Coombs antiglobulin test. A diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease may be made after several types of tests are performed by a health care provider. In some cases, the diagnosis is first suspected by chance if a routine complete blood count (CBC) detects abnormal clumping (agglutination) of the red blood cells. In most cases, the diagnosis is based on evidence of hemolytic anemia (from symptoms and/or blood tests). A person may also be physically examined for spleen or liver enlargement. An antiglobulin test (called the Coombs test) may be performed to determine the presence of a specific type of antibody. In people with cold agglutinin disease, the Coomb's test is almost always positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM). Treatment * Avoid cold weather. * Treat the underlying lymphoma. * No cold drinks; all drinks should be at room temperature (or above). * Requires heater to maintain temperature in cold places. Treatment with rituximab has been described. The treatment of cold agglutinin disease depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause. For example, in those affected by secondary cold agglutinin disease, it is important to diagnose and treat the underlying condition which may include certain types of cancer; bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; and/or other autoimmune disease. People with few symptoms and/or mild anemia may not require any specific treatment. These cases are often managed by simply avoiding exposure to the cold. In severe cases of hemolysis, medical interventions may be necessary. Rituximab (an antibody that selectively reduces specific types of immune cells) is effective in about 60% of cases of severe cold agglutinin disease. Medical researchers have found the response to rituximab is seen on average within 1 to 2 months of treatment and the effect of the treatment lasts for about 1 to 2 years. Rituximab may be used after a second and even a third relapse, however the success rate is less. Combined treatment with rituximab and fludarabine has resulted in higher response rates (76% of cases) and longer periods of remissions (on average, 6.5 years). However the combined treatment may include serious side effects so is presently only recommended when rituximab has not worked alone. Finally, plasmapheresis, which involves filtering blood to remove antibodies, may be useful in acute hemolytic crisis and before surgery requiring hypothermia, however its effect is only short term. Removing the spleen is not recommended for cold agglutinin disease. In addition, because severe cold agglutinin disease requires very high doses of corticosteroids (levels not considered safe), corticosteroid treatment is no longer a recommended treatment in severe cases. Several possible therapies have been reported in a few case reports to have successfully treated people who are not responding to the treatments listed above. However more studies need to be performed before the safety and effectiveness of these therapies can be determined. Prognosis The long-term outlook (prognosis) for people with cold agglutinin disease varies based on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person and the underlying cause. For example, people with cold agglutinin disease caused by bacterial or viral infections tend to have an excellent prognosis; in these cases, the symptoms typically disappear within 6 months after the infection has resolved. Mild to moderate primary (unknown cause) cold agglutinin disease can also be associated with a good prognosis if excessive exposure to the cold is avoided. Those with cold agglutinin disease caused by HIV infection or certain types of cancer generally have a poor prognosis due to the nature of the underlying condition. Epidemiology Cold agglutinin disease most commonly affects adults who are of middle age and older. Some studies also report a slight bias in favor of females in the incidence of cold agglutinin disease, particularly in older populations. People with infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, or mycoplasma pneumonia are more susceptible to this condition. Cold agglutinin disease represents an estimated 16‚Äì32% of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whose annual incidence is estimated to be between 1/35,000-1/80,000 in North America and Western Europe. In patients with infectious mononucleosis, more than 60% of whom develop cold agglutinins disease. Primary cold agglutinin disease In single-center series, primary CAD has been found to account for 13‚Äì15% of the cases of AIHA. Dacie J. The auto-immune haemolytic anaemias: Introduction. In: Dacie J, editor. The haemolytic anaemias. vol. 3. London: Churchill Livingstone; 1992. pp. 1‚Äì5. In a population-based clinical study of primary CAD in Norway, the prevalence was found to be 16 per million in habitants and the incidence rate 1 per million inhabitants per year. Little is known about possible geographic variations. Median age of CAD patients was 76 years and median age at onset of symptoms was approximately 67 years. The male/female ratio has been reported to be 0.5‚Äì0.6 which is not very different from a male/female ratio of 0.72 in an age-matched general population. The frequency of auto-immune disorders other than CAD does probably not differ from what is to be expected in an elderly population with some female predominance. as about 12.5 years from diagnosis and median age at death was 82 years, which implies a life expectancy in these patients similar to that of an age-matched general population. More than 90% of patients with primary CAD have Cold-induced circulatory symptoms ranging from moderate acrocyanosis to severe Raynaud phenomena precipitated even by very slight cold exposure. History Cold hemagglutination was first reported by Landsteiner in 1903Landsteiner K. √úber Beziehungen zwischen dem Blutserum und den K√∂rperzellen. M√ºnchener medizinische Wochenschrift. 1903;50:1812‚Äì1814. and found to occur in human beings in 1918.Clough MC, Richter IM. A study of an auto-agglutinin occurring in human serum. Johns Hopkins Hosp Bull. 1918;29:86‚Äì93. The association of cold hemagglutination with hemolysis was described in 1937 by Rosenthal and Corten.Rosenthal F, Corten M. √úber das Ph√§nomen der Auto-h√§magglutination und √ºber die Eigenscaften der K√§lteh√§magglutinine. Folia Haematol (Leipzig) 1937;58:64‚Äì90. During the 1960s, Dacie and Schubothe published systematic descriptions of 16 CAD patients each. The auto antibodies responsible for hemagglutination at low temperatures, cold agglutinins (CA), may be found in the sera of healthy subjects as well as in patients with AIHA of the cold reactive types. CA bind to erythrocyte surface antigens at a temperature optimum of 0‚Äì4¬∞C. In contrast to polyclonal CA in healthy individuals, monoclonal CA often have a high- thermal amplitude, which contributes to their pathogenicity at temperatures approaching 37¬∞C. Binding of CA causes agglutination of erythrocytes and the antigen‚Äìantibody complex induces complement (C) activation and hemolysis. Essential clinical manifestations of primary CAD are hemolytic anemia and cold-induced circulatory symptoms. Exact estimates of the severity of anemia and the frequency of cold-induced symptoms, however, have not been provided until recent years.

Blue Chip stamps were a loyalty program for customers, similar to discount cards issued by pharmacies and grocery stores in the digital era. A customer making a purchase at a participating store (typically grocery stores, gasoline stations, and pharmacy chains) would be given stamps in proportion to the dollar amount of the purchase. The stamps were dispensed by machines adjacent to the cash register. The customer would paste the stamps (which could be moistened like postage stamps) into books. The books could then be taken to a redemption center and redeemed for merchandise, such as lawn furniture, dining tables, tableware, and many other items. The redemption centers did not maintain a full inventory of items but would order from a catalog on behalf of the customer. The loyalty program was funded through the overall pricing of goods in the participating retailers. With the recession of 1980, cost cutting caused the program to lose popularity, and the growth of credit card transactions competed for retail margins. As computerization developed, less-cumbersome loyalty programs were developed. These programs required less of a customer's time and had lower operational costs. They did not require physical locations for redemption, and the discounts often were restricted to the products offered by the participating stores, i.e., the participating stores were discounting merchandise that they would keep in stock even without the reward program. History and background In 1963, the US government began an antitrust action against Blue Chip Stamp. In 1967, the parties agreed to a consent decree which led to the creation of a new company \\"Blue Chip Stamps\\". In 1975, a lawsuit filed by Blue Chip Stamps was decided by the Supreme Court in the opinion Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores. This ruling helped establish the precedent that only buyers or sellers of securities can file suit for damages due to deceptive practices. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment vehicle of Warren Buffett, began investing in Blue Chip Stamps in 1970. Berkshire's investment in Blue Chip went from 36.5% in 1977, to 60% in 1979, and finally merged in a stock swap in 1983. According to Buffett's 2006 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Blue Chip had 1970 sales of $126 million as about 60 billion \\"stamps were licked by savers, pasted into books, and taken to Blue Chip redemption stores.\\" He also said, \\"When I was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons, I felt I had finally found a sure thing.\\" Sales dropped to $19.4 million in 1980 and $1.5 million in 1990. In 2006, revenues came in at $25,920.  Acquisitions  On January 3, 1972, Blue Chip obtained a controlling interest in See's Candy Shops. Blue Chip later acquired 100% of See's for an overall price of $25 million. Wesco Financial Corporation was an 80.1% owned subsidiary of Blue Chip Stamps until its complete merger into Berkshire Hathaway in 2011.

After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended in 1848, Larkin moved to San Francisco, and was a signer of the original California Constitution. Early years Larkin was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts,Roger D. Joslyn, ed., Vital Records of Charlestown, Mass. to the year 1850 [Boston 1984] the son of Thomas O. Larkin and Ann Rogers,Harlan Hague, David J. Langum, 1995, Thomas O. Larkin: A Life of Patriotism and Profit in Old California, University of Oklahoma Press, and a grandson of the Deacon John Larkin who provided the horse for Paul Revere's famous ride. Larkin's mother was widowed three times ‚Äì her first husband was named Cooper and her third husband was named Amariah Childs, a renowned spice mill owner and banker in Lynn, Massachusetts.Thomas O LarkinThomas O LarkinLarkin, Thomas O.Parker, Robert J. A Yankee in North Carolina. North Carolina Historical Review (October 1937). (accessed August 14, 2014). At the age of 15, Larkin went to Boston to apprentice as a bookbinder but decided against the business. In 1821 he sailed to Wilmington, North Carolina, where he worked as a clerk and experienced a disastrous partnership with a dishonest merchant. He visited Bermuda in 1822 and relatives in New England in 1824. In 1825 he opened a store in Duplin, North Carolina. The fortune he made on the store he lost on a sawmill operation, and in 1830 he returned to Massachusetts, destitute. Here he learned that his half-brother, John Bautista Rogers Cooper, needed his assistance with a business in California, and in September 1831 Thomas left Boston on the ship Newcastle. After a stopover in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), he landed in San Francisco, in April 1832. Larkin House Aboard ship, he met and developed an intimate relationship with Mrs. Rachel Hobson Holmes, who was coming to California to join her husband, Captain A. C. Holmes, a Danish seaman. They traveled together from San Francisco to Monterey where they both boarded at the Cooper house. When Rachel learned she was carrying Thomas‚Äô child, she discreetly moved to Santa Barbara while Thomas remained in Monterey, working with his brother. At Santa Barbara, Rachel gave birth and awaited a dreadful reunion with her husband, but within a few weeks, she learned that her husband had died a year before while at sea en route to Lima. Meanwhile, Larkin worked as a clerk for John B. R. Cooper until early 1833, when he was able to start a small store of his own and build a \\"double geared\\" flour mill, the first of its kind on the West Coast. He was able to invest again in a sawmill, this time in Santa Cruz. He sailed to Santa Barbara and there was reunited with Rachel. They were married there, on board the American bark Volunteer, 1833-06-10. The U. S. Consul for the Sandwich Islands, John Coffin Jones, performed the ceremony and years later when it was discovered he did not have the authority to perform the service, they had to be remarried. In 1835 Larkin built the first two-story house in California, a combination of New England and California building materials and methods that is today known as Monterey Colonial architecture. Larkin House survives today and is part of Monterey State Historic Park. Larkin also built the first wharf at Monterey harbor and was commissioned to rebuild the Customhouse. At that time, all foreign ships had to check in at Monterey to pay import/export tariffs and get official permission to trade. Larkin was well-positioned to engage in trade with Mexico, the United States and other countries. British and American trade with China came to the Pacific Coast by way of the Sandwich Islands. Alta California As a prominent figure in the occasional capital of a distant province of an occasionally unstable nation, Larkin stood in a position of influence that could easily have been his undoing if he chose the wrong side. The fact that he was able to survive through shifting administrations is testimony to his political skills. Despite being a supporter of Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado, he did not involve himself with Alvarado's accusations against Isaac Graham and other foreign residents of the Monterey area, and was not one of those sent to prison in chains in 1840. Larkin loaned money to Alvarado‚Äôs successor, Micheltorena, which he lost when the Governor was overthrown by Alvarado in 1844. He never applied for Mexican citizenship, which required conversion to Catholicism; instead he renewed his visa annually to maintain his legal status. As a non-citizen, he could not legally own land, but he managed to obtain land grants in the names of his children. In 1842, Monterey was surprised by the actions of U.S. Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones, who landed Marines to take over Monterey in the mistaken belief that war had broken out between the United States and Mexico. Larkin and William Hartnell worked to smooth over the situation. Jones was induced to submit a written apology to the angry Mexican officials and withdraw his troops. The Commodore was subsequently removed from his command, but U.S.‚ÄìMexican relations remained tense. The successful conclusion to the affair brought Larkin to the attention of officials in Washington, and in 1843 President Tyler appointed Larkin as the first (and last) American consul to Alta California. The following year, he thwarted a British attempt to acquire California while he was assisting the Mexican government in building a smallpox hospital in Monterey. With the rise of James K. Polk to the Presidency in 1845, war with Mexico seemed unavoidable. Larkin hired William Leidesdorff as Vice Consul in San Francisco, thus relieving himself of some of the burden of the office. Bear Flag Revolt Early in 1846, Larkin received instructions from Secretary of State James Buchanan to begin working covertly to assure all concerned that the United States would support any attempt at secession from Mexico. Toward this end, he secretly employed Abel Stearns to work in southern California. He volunteered to go to Mexico City on behalf of the United States to work out a peaceful settlement, but Congress had already declared war by the time his letter arrived in Washington. He had entered into a dialog with General Mariano Vallejo with the goal of arranging a peaceful annexation of California when the Bear Flag Revolt began on 14 June 1846 and the General was captured and imprisoned by a band of Americans who had heard a rumor that the Mexican authorities were thinking of arresting all Americans. In 1846, Marine Lieutenant Archibald Gillespie was sent by President James Polk with secret messages to U.S. Consul Thomas O. Larkin in Monterey, California, Commodore John D. Sloat commanding the Pacific Squadron and John C. Fr√©mont. Gillespie, after traveling in secret across Mexico and catching a ship to California arrived early June 1846 with the verbal messages from Polk. What was in the messages are unknown but the Bear Flag revolt came as a surprise to Larkin. On 7 July 1846, when Commodore John D. Sloat with three ships occupied Monterey with his marines and \\"blue-jackets\\" (enlisted sailors) and raised the American flag over the Customs House. Commodore (Rear Admiral) Robert Field Stockton replaced Sloat a week later as commander of the Pacific Squadron. Stockton appointed Fremont commander of the volunteer militia formed around his 60-man Corps of Topographical Engineers and the Bear Flag Republicans as the California Battalion and dispatched 160 of them on the USS Cyane (1837) to occupy San Diego and Los Angeles with marine and blue-jacket help. Larkin joined the force sailing for southern California which by 13 August had peacefully occupied San Diego, California and Los Angeles. General Jos√© Castro and Governor P√≠o Pico fled south. Commodore Stockton, the senior military officer in California, appointed Larkin as Naval agent, and Larkin returned to Monterey. The apparently peaceful conquest of California soon began to fray at the edges in southern California. Revolts broke out in Los Angeles, and the occupation forces under Archibald Gillespie and his 30-40 men were driven out. Jos√© Castro returned, and Larkin moved his family to Yerba Buena (San Francisco) as the Californios throughout the province were attempting to repel the thinly spread out California Battalion garrison troops and Navy forces. Larkin was captured outside of the city when, against advice, he tried to go to his deathly ill daughter, still in Monterey. Larkin was forced to ride to Santa Barbara. En route, he witnessed the inconclusive Battle of Natividad (near Salinas) from General Castro's side. He was later imprisoned in Los Angeles and was not reunited with his family until after the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga which ended four months of skirmishes. His daughter died while he was a captive.Walker, Dale L.; Bear Flag Rising: The Conquest of California 1846; Tom Doherty Associates; 1999; United States Now free to own land in his own name, Larkin turned his attention to his new opportunities. In partnership with Robert Semple, he established the city at the Carquinez Straits that became Benicia, but Larkin‚Äôs business interests were in San Francisco and he sold out his share after a few years. As he took control of his own affairs, his relationship with Leidesdorff fell apart. By the time of the Gold Rush, Larkin had permanently settled in the city by the Bay and was there in time for the economic boom that followed. It was as a representative from San Francisco that he served at the 1849 Constitutional Convention, held in Monterey. Larkin's grave at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, Colma, California Early in 1850, he built the first brick building in San Francisco at 1116 Stockton Street. Later that same year, he returned to New York and remained there until 1853 for the education of his children. During this time he pressed the Federal government for compensation for money he claimed he had spent on Naval supplies and for work on the Monterey Customs House and the wharf there, without satisfaction. Larkin acquired several land grants including Rancho Jimeno, Rancho Boga, Rancho Cienega del Gabilan, Rancho Pleyto, Rancho Cotate, and Rancho Larkin‚Äôs Children. In his last years, Larkin engaged in land speculation and was thought by some to be the richest man in America. On October 27, 1858, while at Colusa, California, he contracted typhoid fever and died within a week. He was buried in what was the Laurel Hill Cemetery in San Francisco, but he is now interred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. The Larkin House in Monterey is a National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmark. Larkin Street in San Francisco is named for him. An elementary school in Monterey, now closed, was named for him. Death Larkin died on Oct 27, 1858. His obituary was published in the Sacramento Daily Union, Vol 16, # 2368, on Oct 29, 1858.

From an electoral and administrative perspective Nantgarw falls within the ward of Taffs Well, a village some south, but historically fell within the boundaries of Caerphilly, which is a major town located less than to the east. The original village was destroyed by the development of the A470 trunk road, which was situated at the location of the current A468 junction. Located close to the A470, Nantgarw is within easy reach of the town of Pontypridd ( to the northwest) and Cardiff City centre (around further south). Nantgarw is the home of the Nantgarw tradition of folk dancing. History Nantgarw lies on the River Taff. It is known for its porcelain, produced in between 1813-1814, and later between 1817-1820 at the Nantgarw Pottery, commemorated at the Nantgarw Chinaworks Museum. The potter and painter William Billingsley is credited with starting the porcelain trade here. After the building of the Glamorganshire Canal, by the 1841 census of the 300 residents, about 60 owed their living to work associated directly with the canal. But the development of drift mines and the development of the Taff Vale Railway, meant that by 1875 the majority of the villages residents were colliers. The development of the village stopped until the 1910 development of the Nantgarw Colliery, but various geographical problems resulted in a series of stalled developments of the colliery until post World War II, when new workings and a coking coal plant were developed by 1951. A new village settlement was then built on the hillside behind the colliery. Nantgarw was formerly served by two railway stations: Nantgarw (High Level) Halt on the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway, which opened in 1904, and Nantgarw (Low Level) Halt on the Cardiff Railway, which opened in 1911. The Low Level station did not last long after the 1921 Railways Act, and closed in 1931 (though the line continued to serve Nantgarw Colliery until the late 1980s. The High Level station closed in 1956.Hutton, J. An Illustrated History of Cardiff Docks, Volume 3. Silver Link. 2009, p. 54 Nantgarw Colliery Craig Yr Allt Colliery was situated south of Nantgarw village. However, whenever the Taff River flooded, water frequently entered its workings, and it was abandoned in 1878. Thomas Taylor of Pontypridd began the development of Nantgarw colliery in May 1910, near the base of the Caerphilly Syncline seam.http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/coalhouse/sites/mines/pages/nantgarw_colliery.shtml The sinking of the twin shafts in 1911 reached the coal seam at a depth of more than 850 yards in 1915, placing them 2000 ft below sea level and making Nantgarw the deepest pit to be sunk in the South Wales Coalfield up to that time.http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/GlamEast/Nantgarw.htm Having suffered from various geographical issues, Powell Duffryn designed a development scheme in 1937, but work was suspended when World War II broke out in 1939. A later project to re-open the colliery was approved by the Ministry of Fuel and Power in 1946, and after nationalisation in 1947, the National Coal Board invested ¬£5 million on modern surface constructions and modern mining methods. Having survived the mass pit closures of the 1960s, the geographical problems meant the closure of the mine working in 1974, and the unit merged with Windsor Colliery, Abertridwr, Caerphilly from 1975. By 1979, the combined Nantgarw/Windsor Colliery employed around 650 men, producing over 4,000 tons of coal per week, making a profit of over ¬£0.5 million. The unit lost ¬£7 million in 1981, employing: 142 on development; 131 on the coalface; 197 below the ground; 101 on the surface. In 1982 output declined steeply as a major coal seam at Windsor became unworkable, while in 1984 an overtime ban led directly to the 1984/5 UK miners strike spreading to South Wales. Although profitable post the strike, both sites of the whole unit closed as part of the NCB regional review on 6 November 1986. Village today The village declined after the 1969 construction of the A470 which destroyed the historic old village. After the closure of the Nantgarw/Windsor Colliery and Coking works 18 months after the miners strike, the site was developed as Parc Nantgarw, joined to the larger Trefforest Industrial Estate. All that now remains of Nantgarw colliery are two small concrete pyramids marking the sites of the two shafts and a commemorative winding wheel. Parc Nantgarw is home to the headquarters of Cadw (the Welsh equivalent of English Heritage), and a large office for the newly relocated Santia Consulting. The social side of the estate provides a cinema, indoor 10 pin bowling and various restaurants. GE Aviation Wales, located on the Caerphilly Road, employs about 1500 people in the testing, repair and maintenance of aircraft engines, including GE90, GP7200, CFM56 and RB211. Coleg y Cymoedd is a further education college for adult learners. The college has a campus in Nantgarw. Nantgarw Infants School Opened on 11 March 1907 with 55 children, it was destroyed by fire in April 1933. The school moved to Wheeler's Billiard Hall, the school was reopened on 2 September 1935. An extension providing interior toilets, a small kitchen and an office for the head teacher was built in 1979. The school is now closed.

Mission The primary mission objective of Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52) was to conduct particles and fields investigations of the polar magnetosphere of the earth out to 21 earth radii. Secondary objectives were to make magnetic field and plasma distribution measurements in the solar wind, and to study Type-3 radio emissions caused by solar electron streams in the interplanetary medium. To accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft was instrumented with following instruments: * a plasma wave receiver,NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive ELF/VLF Receivers * a fluxgate magnetometer,NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer and * a low energy proton-electron differential energy analyzer.NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive Low-Energy Protons and Electrons The spacecraft was spin stabilized with a nominal rotational period of 11 s. In celestial coordinates, the positive spin axis coordinates were right ascension 299.4 degrees (plus or minus 1.1 deg) and declination 8.6 deg (plus or minus 1.5 deg). There was no onboard orientation or spin rate control, but the orientation of the spin axis was stable. An optical aspect system operated from launch until September 3, 1974 at which time the optical aspect system was turned off and failed to turn back on. After this period, aspect had to be determined by observing the effect of optical illumination from the sun on a plasma measurement system. Using the sharp peak observed in this data, corrected orientation information was obtained and rewritten to the data records. The complete spacecraft with instruments had a mass of . Power of 22 to 36 W, depending on solar aspect, was obtained from solar cells. Hawkeye 1 participated in the International Magnetospheric Study (IMS) and during the first half of 1977 data acquisition was confined to IMS special intervals. Data were obtained in real time only, at frequencies of 136 and 400 MHz at 100 bit/s (or 200 bit/s with convolutional coding) plus wideband VLF data. Specifics It was designed, built, and tracked by personnel at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa whose sports teams are the Hawkeyes. The spacecraft was launched on June 3, 1974 into a polar orbit with initial apogee over the North Pole and re-entered on April 28, 1978 after 667 orbits or nearly four years of continuous operation. The spacecraft apogee was between 20.28 and 20.92 Earth radii with less than a 1.7 Earth radii perigee. The orbital period was 51.3 hours. During its lifetime, the inclination of the plane of the spacecraft's orbit to the Earth's equator decreased monotonically from 89.81 to 81.85 degrees. The spacecraft's axis of rotation at launch was inertially fixed in its orbital plane, directed towards a constant right ascension and declination, and nearly parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane.

Its boundaries are marked by East Fayette Street, East Monument Street, Linwood Avenue, and Patterson Park Avenue. South of McElderry Park is the neighborhood of Patterson Park; Butchers Hill is to the southwest. Ellwood Park is located to the east, and the campus of The Johns Hopkins Hospital to the west. To its north is the neighborhood of Madison-East End. In the early 1980s, McElderry Park suffered from white flight and abandonment by its working class homeowners. The closing of nearby public housing flooded the neighborhood with Section 8 tenants in individual rowhomes and apartments, with additional street crime, and illegal drug trade. Throughout the 1990s, the area became the most crime-ridden in old East Baltimore. Efforts are underway to turn things around, replacing abandoned buildings with productive uses such as public gardens. The 2000 census reported that 34.3 percent of McElderry Park's families had incomes below the poverty line. Although predominantly black, the neighborhood has significant white and Hispanic populations. History The Park takes its name from the McElderry family, who were wealthy merchants in Baltimore in the early 19th century. Irish immigrant Thomas McElderry (17581810) arrived in Baltimore in 1793 and quickly established himselfbuilding a wharf that bore his name, improving Market Square, and helping found the Baltimore Water Company. McElderry Park is located entirely within the bounds of the East Monument Historic District. Historically, McElderry and the nearby neighborhood of Middle East were the heart of the Czech immigrant community in Baltimore. This area was often known as \\"Little Bohemia\\" or \\"Swampoodle\\". Jimmy Carter lends a hand Former 38th president Jimmy Carter [served 1977-1981], assisted 300 volunteers on October 5, 2010 at a \\"Habitat for Humanity\\" project in McElderry Park. This weeklong project restored vacant houses in the 2400 block of Jefferson Street. \\"Habitat for Humanity of the Chesapeake\\" has been working with the Monument-McElderry-Fayette Revitalization Plan Board since 2006 on a long-term plan to restore blighted portions of McElderry Park. When they began work in 2007, only two of 43 houses in the 2400 block of Jefferson Street were occupied. The Plan Board's co-chairman expected to have 32 of the houses owner-occupied by the end of 2010. Amazing Port Street Sacred Commons \\"Amazing Port Street Sacred Commons\\" is a prayer labyrinth, perennial garden, and open, grassy field located behind the Amazing Grace Lutheran Church (founded/merged 1996 from several earlier Lutheran churches), located at 2424 McElderry Street. The space currently used by the Commons was previously occupied by abandoned, dilapidated houses. It was purchased and developed by the church as open green space with a grant from the TKF Foundation. The Commons is open to the public, of all faiths, as required by the grant. Produce from the garden is distributed by the church's food pantry, the \\"Center for Grace-full Living\\".

Ford was a founder of noise rockers, Lubricated Goat (1986‚Äì89) in Perth. During the 1980s Ford played in many different bands, including the Kryptonics (1986‚Äì87) and X (with Ian Rilen of Rose Tattoo). In 1987 Ford and his then-wife, Melanie Greensmith, established a rock couture fashion label, Wheels and Doll Baby. According to Ford's family, he died in 2007 from Cardiac arrest.  Biography  Brett Ford was born in 1959 and was raised in Melbourne. He was a member of different groups, Exhibit A, Rockafellas and Kansas City Killers. Ford was in Perth when he joined the Kryptonics on drums in mid-1986 alongside Peter Hartley on guitar (ex- Rockafellas, X-Offenders, Lavender Disaster), Ian Underwood on guitar and vocals and Cathy Webb on bass guitar. That line-up released the group's second single, \\"Land That Time Forgot\\" (January 1987), and third single, \\"Cyclops\\", before breaking up in mid-1987. In September 1986 his former bandmate from Exhibit A, Stu Spasm (also ex-Zulu Rattle, Salamander Jim, Beasts of Bourbon, James Baker Experience, Death in Vegas, Hot Property), invited Ford and Hartley to record material as Lubricated Goat, while they were still members of Kryptonics. Their five tracks were included with four more that Spasm had recorded with Martin Bland in Adelaide, as the noise rock group's first album, Plays the Devil's Music (July 1987). Ford co-wrote the tracks, \\"Guttersnipe\\" and \\"Nerve Quake\\", with Hartley and Spasm. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' or 'Performer:' Guy Maddison (ex-Greenhouse Effect) joined on bass guitar and the group released their second album, Paddock of Love (July 1988). Besides drums Ford provided harmonica, backing vocals and song writing. One of the tracks, \\"In the Raw\\", co-written by Ford and Spasm, was performed in November 1988 on Australian Broadcasting Corporation's TV series, Blah Blah Blah. The members appeared in the nude while lip-syncing to the track as the episode dealt with censorship. Ford formed the Punjabbers in Sydney in 1988 with Roddy Radalj on guitar and vocals (ex-Exterminators, the Scientists, Rockets, Le Hoodoo Gurus, Johnnys, Love Rodeo, James Baker Experience, Dubrovniks), Tony Robertson on bass guitar (ex-Hitmen, New Christs, Naked Lunch) and Tony Thewlis on guitar (ex- Scientists). They issued a single, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Love Letter\\", on Timberyard Records in December. Radalj left and the group broke up. In 1990 Ford joined Rattlesnake Shake, a garage rock group. The line-up included Steve Beves on guitar (ex-Melting Skyscrapers, Naked Lunch), Tony Gibson on guitar (ex-ME 262, Decline of the Reptiles), Andy Newman on bass guitar (ex-Trans 262, Howling Commandos) and Peter Patterson on vocals (ex-Melting Skyscrapers, Naked Lunch). They issued a self-titled EP in August on Rattlesnake Records, in March 1991 they changed their name to Dark Carnival and then to Thrill Killers a month later. Ford left soon after.

In re Madden was an appeal by Titan Sports, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., in the case Titan Sports, Inc. v. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. Titan, the parent company of World Wrestling Entertainment, at the time known as the World Wrestling Federation, had sought to discover anonymous sources used by Mark Madden, an employee of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which at the time had Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc. as its parent company. Madden, citing his journalist's privilege, refused to disclose the names of the sources during his deposition. The District Court upheld his right to the privilege under Pennsylvania's shield law. Titan appealed the initial ruling, and the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Madden was an entertainer and not a journalist. Known as the Madden test, the Court said that an individual may be afforded a journalist's privilege if he can prove he is (1) engaged in investigative reporting, (2) is gathering news, and (3) possessed the intent at the inception of the news-gathering process to disseminate the news to the public.In re Madden, 151 F.3d at 131.

It closed after exploding on 23 April 2004, killing five employees. Formosa Plastics Corporation () is a Taiwanese plastics company based in Taiwan (formerly called \\"Formosa\\") that primarily produces polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins and other intermediate plastic products. It is the corporation around which influential businessman Wang Yung-ching formed the Formosa Plastics Group, and it remains central to the Group's petrochemical operations. The president of Formosa Plastics Corp. (FPC) is Jason Lin (ÊûóÂÅ•Áî∑). In 2019, Chemical & Engineering News ranked Formosa Plastics as the world's sixth largest chemical company by sales in 2018, with US$36.9 billion. That same year, Forbes ranked the company as No. 758 on its Global 2000 list of the world's largest public companies. Formosa has received substantial criticism over widespread pollution and reprisal tactics against environmental activists.  History  The company was founded in 1954, by Wang Yung-ching and Wang Yung-tsai with a US$798,000 loan from United States aid agencies. The first PVC plant was constructed in Kaohsiung and production began in 1957. As of 2005, FPC is the largest producer of PVC resins in Taiwan. When FPC's American operations are also considered, the company's total PVC resin capacity is 2.83 million metric tons per year, the second highest in the world after Shin-Etsu Chemical, which has 3.55 million metric tons per year as of May 2010 (expanding to 3.85 million metric tons per year by the end of 2010). FPC maintains numerous subsidiaries throughout Taiwan, jointly held with other members of the Formosa Plastics Group. In addition, Formosa Plastics Corporation, USA was founded in 1978 as a wholly owned subsidiary of FPC. That subsidiary has, in turn, created four wholly owned chemical manufacturing subsidiaries in Delaware City, Delaware, Illiopolis, Illinois, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Point Comfort, Texas. Formosa Plastics Corporation's operations include chemical and petrochemical manufacturing. In 1994, Formosa formed the Formosa Transrail to operate a rail fleet.  Recent updates  In April 2018, Formosa Plastics and sister corporation Formosa Petrochemical Corporation announced a new US$9.4 billion chemical manufacturing complex, set to be located across a 2,400-acre site in St. James Parish, Louisiana. Branded as \\"The Sunshine Project,\\" the complex, made up of 14 facilities, including 10 plants, would produce ethylene glycol, polyethylene, and polypropylene. Construction was initially set to begin in 2019, with the initial opening date set for 2024 and the final stage of the development being completed by approximately 2029. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) approved the air permits for the project in January 2020. In February 2020, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit to challenge LDEQ's approval of the air permits. In May 2018, citing stronger demand in the co-polymer market, Formosa Plastics announced new expansions in polyethylene and polypropylene production plant technologies for its facility in Point Comfort, all licensed from ExxonMobil, Univation Technologies, and Japan Polypropylene Corporation. In August 2019, the first of two new polyethylene plants had begun operating. The second plant and cracker were scheduled to fully operate in December 2019, but their opening was delayed until at least April 2020, pending further updates. The new polypropylene plant is scheduled to begin operating in the third quarter of 2021. In August 2019, Formosa Plastics announced it was planning to invest in a US$332 million expansion at its Baton Rouge facility to expand production of PVC resin. Construction began later in the year and is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2021. The expansion would allow the company to produce an additional 300 million pounds of resin. For the expansion, the company would receive a performance-based grant up to US$500,000 from the state of Louisiana.  Controversies   Pollution and waste violations  In 1999, Formosa Plastics used bribes to dump 3000 tons of mercury-laden waste in Sihanoukville, Cambodia ‚Äì three local villagers died shortly afterwards, although a report commissioned by the World Health Organization concluded it was unlikely the deaths were due to mercury poisoning.Taiwan Used Bribes, Corruption to Dump Mercury Waste in Cambodia The company later tried to ship the waste to a hazardous waste site in Nevada.ReviewJournal\\"Nevada targeted for toxic sludge A 2002 survey undertaken by Scorecard, an environmental watch group, rated Formosa Plastics' facilities in the 90% percentile of the worst environmental polluters.Scorecard In September 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced that Formosa Plastics would spend more than US$10 million to address air, water, and hazardous waste violations from two of the company's plants in Point Comfort and Baton Rouge, after inspectors found leak detection and repair and waste violations at the facilities. Formosa Plastics also agreed to pay an additional civil penalty of US$2.8 million for numerous federal law violations. In April 2012, Formosa Plastics filed a US$1.3 million civil suit for a tort claim and a criminal suit for defamation against Ben-Jei Tsuang, a scientist who works at National Chung Hsing University in Taichung, for presenting evidence of increased cancer risk in the vicinity of the Formosa Plastic Group hydrocarbon- processing facility in Mailiao at a scientific meeting and in a paper. More than 1,000 academics, including chemistry Nobel laureate Yuan T. Lee, signed a letter of support for Tsuang. In September 2013, judges at Taipei District Court ruled against Formosa Plastics.Taiwan court clears academic in libel suit, Michele Catanzaro, Nature, 4 September 2013 In April 2016, Formosa Plastics was blamed by numerous protesters and media outlets for mass fish deaths in four provinces of Vietnam since 6 April. On 30 June 2016, the Vietnamese government officially concluded that the local Formosa Plastics affiliate steel plant was responsible for the marine ecological disaster. Formosa Plastics agreed to pay compensation of US$500 million and publicly apologized for the disaster. Controversy grew over rumors that the apology was issued under coercion from the Vietnamese government. In July 2017, retired shrimper Diane Wilson sued Formosa Plastics in Federal court for up to US$184 million for damages relating to the company's noncompliance with state and federal environmental permits and laws that require companies to report all waste violations, particularly with the discharge of plastic pellets into Lavaca Bay and other waterways from the company's Point Comfort plant. In March 2019, the trial began and in June 2019, U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt ruled against Formosa Plastics, noting the company's consistent violation of state-issued permits and federal laws. In October 2019, Formosa Plastics agreed to pay US$50 million over five years in a settlement to fund projects reversing water pollution damage in Calhoun County and also comply with \\"zero discharge\\" of plastic pollutants in the future, making it the largest settlement of a Clean Water Act suit filed by private individuals.  Explosions  Formosa Plastics has been involved in a series of deadly explosions at their facilities.

During his over 26-season playing career mostly spent with the Nankai Hawks (now the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks), he became one of NPB's greatest offensive catchers. He was awarded the Pacific League MVP Award five times, became the first NPB batter to win the Triple Crown in 1965, and holds the record for second-most home runs and RBIs in NPB history. Nomura was a player-manager for the last eight years he was with the Hawks, leading them to the Pacific League title in 1973. After playing, he became a full-time manager and served led the Yakult Swallows to four league titles and three Japan Series championships from 1990 to 1998. Later, he managed the Hanshin Tigers for three seasons and the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles for four seasons until his retirement in 2009. As a manager, Nomura recorded 1,565 wins, the fifth-most wins of any manager in NPB history. He was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.  Biography   Early life  Nomura was born in the coastal fishing village of Amino (now Ky≈çtango) in Kyoto Prefecture. When he was three years old, his father died of disease while serving in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Nomura grew up in poverty with his mother and older brother. With the help of his brother, he was able to attend high school.  Playing career  After graduating from Mineyama High School, Nomura joined the Nankai Hawks after a tryout in 1954. The team's manager at the time believed he'd at least be useful as a catcher for pitching practice. That year, Nomura played in nine games and went hitless for the season. The Hawks discussed cutting him from the team, however, he was given another chance reportedly after Nomura offered to play for free and even threatened to throw himself in front of a train if he was let go. During a career that spanned four decades from 1954 to 1980, Nomura hit 657 home runs and led the Pacific League in homers eight straight seasons. (However, it should be taken into consideration that his home park, Osaka Stadium, measured only 276 feet down the lines until 1972, and 300 feet from 1972 onward, and 380 feet to straightaway center‚Äîtiny dimensions by Major League Baseball standards.) He finished his career with 2901 hits. In 1965, Nomura won the league's first Triple Crown. He was a player-manager between 1970 and 1977. He played for 26 years, the longest NPB playing career until Kimiyasu Kudo pitched in his 27th season in 2008; Kudo retired in 2010 having played 29 seasons.  Managerial career  Nomura began his 24-year managerial career as player-manager of the Hawks in 1970. During his eight year stint as Hawks manager, he led the team to the Pacific League title in 1973. After his playing career, Nomura went on to become a full-time manager. From 1990 to 1998, he managed the Yakult Swallows, leading them to four league titles and three Japan Series championships. While managing the Swallows, Nomura mentored the team's catcher, Atsuya Furuta. Under Nomura, Furuta flourished and became a hall of fame catcher in his own right. Following his role as Yakult manager, Nomura joined the Hanshin Tigers and managed the team from 1999 to 2001. The team finished last in the Central League all three seasons. On December 5, 2001, his wife, television personality Sachiyo Nomura, was arrested for tax evasion. Nomura resigned from his managerial position the next day. His wife was accused of hiding ¬•45 million of his income, however Nomura was not accused of any criminal responsibility. Nomura in 2010 After the scandal, Nomura managed the amateur corporate league team Shidax from 2003 to 2005. He left after three seasons to return to NPB. The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles had a poor showing during their inaugural 2005 season. It was the first PL club in 40 years to lose at least 90 games in one season. They finished with a 38-97-1 record. Hoping to improve for their second season, the team hired Nomura to manage the club because of his experience. Over the next four season, he helped turn Rakuten around. By his final season with the team, the Eagles finished the regular season in with their best-ever showing up to that point in time, second place, securing them a position in the Climax Series. After losing in the final stage of the 2009 Pacific League Climax Series, Nomura retired from managing at the age of 74. As a manager, Nomura recorded 1,565 wins, the fifth-most wins of any manager in NPB history.  Legacy  During his playing time, Pacific League games were rarely televised. Because of this, Nomura was often overshadowed by his Central League contemporaries such as superstars Sadaharu Oh and Shigeo Nagashima of the Yomiuri Giants. He openly resented this and felt he never received the attention that he deserved as a player. Over 26-season playing career, however, Nomura amassed a number of awards, titles and records. During his time with the Hawks, he won five Pacific League MVP Awards ‚Äì the most of any PL player and second-most all-time. Nomura also led the PL in home runs for nine seasons, eight of which were consecutive and won 19 Best Nine Awards for best catcher in the league. He accumulated 657 home runs, 1,988 RBIs and 2,901 hits in 3,017 games, all of which are 2nd in the all-time rankings. He was elected into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame by the Selection Committee for Players in 1989.  Personal life  While married to his first wife Masako, Nomura began a relationship with Sachiyo in 1972. Shortly after, Sachiyo became pregnant and gave birth to future NPB player Katsunori Nomura in 1973. After this, Masako had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide, and later died of cancer. Sachiyo and Katsuya married in 1978. The two remained married until her death in 2017 at age 85. Sports agents Kenny and Don Nomura, Sachiyo's children from her previous marriage, are Katsuya's step-children. Katsuya died of heart failure on February 11, 2020, at age 84.

The Vindicator was established in 1869. As of September 1, 2019, The Vindicator is owned by Ogden Newspapers Inc. of Wheeling, West Virginia. under The Tribune Chronicle staff and The Vindicator is now published by Charles Jarvis, and its editor is Brenda Linert. The new owners of The Vindicator announced a welcome to the new version of the Vindicator. History (1869-1984) The paper began in 1869 when it launched as The Mahoning Vindicator. The paper became the Youngstown Vindicator shortly after. During the 1920s, Ku Klux Klan members began protesting outside of then owner William F. Maag, Jr.'s house in response to the paper's reporting of local KKK activities. Its reporting on the KKK, the mafia, political corruption, and big business matters garnered the paper a reputation of fearlessness. Almost 70 politicians, mafia members, and business people were convicted of criminal acts as a result of the paper's reporting in the late 1980s. In 1984, the paper became The Vindicator. The Vindicator's past owners Before September 1, 2019, The Vindicator was locally owned by the Maag family (longtime area residents) and run by the now ceased Vindicator Printing Company, which still runs local NBC affiliate WFMJ-TV and WFMJ's digital subchannel, CW affiliate WBCB. Historically, the paper is known for its reputation of fearless reporting on matters relating to local corruption, the mafia, and the Ku Klux Klan. On August 16, 2019, The Vindicator and Tribune Chronicle reached an agreement for the Tribune Chronicle to acquire The Vindicator‚Äôs subscription list, The Vindicator masthead and the Vindy.com domain, according to The Vindicator former general manager Mark Brown. After August 31, 2019, The Vindicator temporarily ceased publication and operations were turned over to the staff of its former primary competitor, the Tribune Chronicle, in nearby Warren, Ohio. The Tribune Chronicle's traditional news coverage area is Trumbull County and parts of northeastern Portage County as opposed to the broader news coverage area of The Vindicator. The Tribune Chronicle has now published The Vindicator for the Mahoning County region since September 1, 2019. Switching eras The Vindicator published a special final edition from the former owners of The Vindicator Printing Company on the evening of August 30, 2019. The former staff gathered that evening to print more than 34,000 of the final edition papers. The paper produced around 3,500 more copies than usual to meet the high demand for the final printing. The former employees, their families and friends gathered at the former press room at 9 o'clock August, 30, 2019 evening to see the former printing presses fired up one last time. The former staff members included Publisher Betty Brown Jagnow, General Manager Mark Brown, Editor Todd Franko, Politics & Community Columnist Bertram de Souza and Chief Photographer Robert K. Yosay. Sections (before August 31, 2019) Monday through Saturday, the newspaper publishes three sections: * Local and national news as well as editorial (Section A) * Sports and weather (Section B) * Classifieds, Valley Life and comics (Section C) Each Thursday before August 31, 2019, The Vindicator prints Valley 24, a tabloid style entertainment guide for the coming weekend. On Saturdays, a TV listings magazine is included. The Sunday edition is, like most other newspapers, greatly expanded. Each Sunday, The Vindicator publishes a page entitled \\"Connected\\" which includes curated, Youngstown-themed social media posts and a column written by social media researcher and critic Adam Earnheardt. In addition to the sections mentioned, there is also sections dedicated to business, entertainment, life and work, and health, among others. As of September 1, 2019, TICKET, a special section produced by the Tribune Chronicle and led by Andy Gray, the Tribune Chronicle‚Äôs veteran entertainment writer, each Thursday has provided award-winning coverage of the local entertainment scene. TICKET now will be published in The Vindicator edition as well. Websites (before August 31, 2019) The Vindicator operated four primary websites: the news and information site vindy.com; a local employment portal vindyjobs.com; vindywheels.com, a local automotive shopping site; and vindyhomes.com, a local real estate site. The vast majority of content available on vindy.com is provided at no charge. There is, however, a \\"digital edition\\" available on the site at the same subscription rate as the printed edition. It is delivered in PDF format. The Vindicator breaks local news on its primary website, vindy.com, throughout the day and night. This feature is branded \\"News Watch\\" and is updated more frequently than the general site. As of September 1, 2019, vindy.com is controlled by the Tribune Chronicle. The vindy.com website, post September 1, 2019, is a completely new website and does not host any older articles or content archives. Additionally, the Disqus commenting system which was on the previous website is gone as the new owners have opted for comment free articles. Strike action The paper's staff has gone on strike twice. The first strike was in 1964 and lasted nearly eight months; the strikers published the Steel Valley News during this time. The second strike lasted from November 2004 to July 2005, and the strikers published their own paper, The Valley Voice, during this time. Editorial changes Prior to August 31, 2019, Todd Franko, metro editor of The Rockford Register Star in Illinois, was named editor of The Vindicator on February 12, 2007. He succeeds Paul C. Jagnow, who retired in 2006. As of September 1, 2019, The Vindicator is now published by Tribune Chronicle of which Brenda Linert is the editor.

Her family moved to Denver and she started listening to Billie Holiday, whose life and singing had a profound influence on her. In the early 1960s she followed the recommendation of friends to move to New York. Albert Ayler heard her in a dining club and introduced her to Bernard Stollman, the owner of the experimental jazz label ESP-Disk. Her most influential albums, Sings (1965) and College Tour (1966) were made for this label. Her best known recording is a nearly fourteen minute version of the traditional song \\"Black Is the Colour (Of My True Love's Hair)\\" (from Sings), which is rendered in a haunting, anguished wail.

She founded the Cabot Tradition of the Science of Witchcraft and the Witches' League for Public Awareness to defend the civil rights of witches everywhere. She lives in Salem, where she owned a shop. Cabot claims to be related to the prominent Boston Brahmin Cabot family. Life and career and possible inspirations Laurie Cabot was born Mercedes Elizabeth Kiersey. She grew up in California and came east to New England as a teenager. She maintains that her interest in the occult began in childhood. She developed this interest in Boston through time she spent as a young woman in the halls of the Boston Public Library. During the 1950s, Cabot worked as a dancer in a Boston nightclub called \\"The Latin Quarter\\" owned by Lou Walters, father of TV journalist Barbara Walters. Cabot was asked by Mr. Walters to open his Las Vegas Latin Quarter, but she declined. Cabot married and divorced twice, with each marriage producing a daughter. Cabot chose to raise her daughters as Witches, and she began appearing in black robes and black eye- makeup in her everyday life. She identifies herself as a Witch, but not as a follower of the modern Wiccan religion, as she practiced Witchcraft before Wicca became a popular movement. The kind of Witchcraft that Cabot practices focuses on the Art and Science of Witchcraft. 1970 TV's sitcom Bewitched visited Salem for a series of episodes with location filming.Harpiesbizarre.com Laurie Cabot opened the town's first \\"Witch Shoppe\\" in Salem in 1971, which became a tourist destination thanks to the national TV exposure. In 1986, after the release of the film version of The Witches of Eastwick, John Updike's novel about single suburban women venturing into the occult, Cabot established the Witches' League for Public Awareness to counter negative images of her religion in popular culture and the media. \\"Here are three women who have nothing better to do, because they are so frustrated sexually, than to get involved with witchcraft,\\" Cabot said of the movie. \\"They are not witches. If they are anything, they are weekend Satanists. They don't do one witchy thing in the whole film.\\" Cabot's shop sold herbs, jewelry, Tarot decks, and other items used in witchcraft. She later moved her shop to an old gambrel-roofed house on Essex Street. This new shop was named \\"Crow Haven Corner\\". The physical store is still open, but is no longer owned or managed by any member of the Cabot family (formerly, her eldest daughter Jody owned and ran it). Cabot's final shop in Salem, The Cat, the Crow and the Crown on Pickering Wharf, later renamed The Official Witch Shoppe, closed its doors in February 2012.http://www.boston.com/yourtown/salem/articles/2012/02/09/laurie_cabot_salems_official_witch_closes_up_shop_after_40_years/?page=2 Cabot still maintains an online business and sells her hand-crafted magic products at Enchanted, a witch shoppe on Pickering Wharf in Salem . In March 2008, Cabot celebrated her 75th birthday at a surprise birthday party that was attended by hundreds of witches, including Sully Erna of the band Godsmack, for whom Cabot had appeared in the band's \\"Voodoo\\" music video, shot at Hammond Castle.

Structure It is somewhat crescent-shaped, with its convexity directed forward: Medially, it is in relation with the internal carotid artery and the posterior part of the cavernous sinus. The motor root runs in front of and medial to the sensory root, and passes beneath the ganglion; it leaves the skull through the foramen ovale, and, immediately below this foramen, joins the mandibular nerve. The greater superficial petrosal nerve lies also underneath the ganglion. The ganglion receives, on its medial side, filaments from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. It gives off minute branches to the tentorium cerebelli, and to the dura mater in the middle fossa of the cranium. From its convex border, which is directed forward and lateralward, three large nerves proceed, viz., the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3). The ophthalmic and maxillary consist exclusively of sensory fibers; the mandibular is joined outside the cranium by the motor root. Clinical significance After recovery from a primary herpes infection, the virus is not cleared from the body, but rather lies dormant in a non- replicating state within the trigeminal ganglion. Herpes Labialis may follow from primary herpes infection/herpetic gingivostomatitis The trigeminal ganglion is damaged, by infection or surgery, in Trigeminal trophic syndrome. Trigeminal trophic syndrome causes paresthesias and anesthesia, which may lead to erosions of the nasal ala. The thermocoagulation or injection of glycerol into the trigeminal ganglion has been used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Other animals Rodents In rodents, the trigeminal ganglion is important as it is the first part of the pathway from the whiskers to the brain. Cell bodies of the whisker primary afferents are found here. These afferents are mechanoreceptor cells that fire in response to whisker deflection. There are around 26,000-43,000 cell bodies in rodent Trigeminal ganglion. It is possible that there are two distinct (or perhaps continuous) populations of cells having slowly and rapidly adapting responses to stimuli. It is found at the base of the skull and projects to trigeminal brain stem areas including principalis, spinal trigeminal nucleus, interpolaris, and caudalis.

Religion in Khuldabad City Religion in Khuldabad Taluka History The place has not only religious importance due to the location of tombs of some Sufi saints, but has also historical importance. It is here that Emperor Aurangazeb, the last of the Mughals lies interred. Aurangzeb, was described in official writings by the posthumous title of Khuld-makan (‚ÄòHe whose abode is in eternity'). Here are also buried Azam Shah, Aurangzeb's son, Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of the Hyderabad dynasty, his second son Nasir Jang, Nizare Shah, king of Ahemadnagar, Tana Shah, last of the Golkonda kings and a host of minor celebrities. The place contains from 15 to 20 doersed tombs and about 1400 plain sepulchre. Khuldabad was once an important and prosperous town. The gardens which surround many of these tombs are overgrown with bushes. Places of interest Khuldabad is surrounded by a high fortified wall built by Aurangzeb. It has seven gates viz., Nagarkhana, Pangra, Langda, Mangalpeth, Kumbi Ali, Hamdadi and a wicket called Azam Shahi. The gateway in the direction of Aurangabad is approached by a paved ascent which continue inside the town for about 200 to 300 feet. The wall has collapsed at many places and may collapse totally before long. The sepulchre of Aurangzeb lies almost midway between the north and the south gates. It is within the enclosure containing the dargah of Burhan ud din . A steep paved ascent some 30 yards in length leads from the road side to the entrance of the building. After passing through a domed-porch and gateway, erected in about 1760, a large quadrangle is entered, on three side of which am open-fronted buildings. While one of these is used for conducting a school, others are set apart for the use of travellers. In the centre of the south side is a nagarkhana and a mosque in the west. A facsimile of the hall of the mosque is just below, a flight of steps descending to it from the verge of the platform. Right opposite the north end of the mosque is a small open gateway leading into an inner courtyard.[Gazetteer of Aurangabad - H. H. The Nizam's Government 1884. (Chapter VI page 385-415 & Chapter XI page 805-877 )] Aurangzeb's Tomb Tomb of Aurangzeb, Khuldabad, 1850s. Tomb of Aurangzeb, Khuldabad, 1890s. Aurangazeb's tomb in Khuldabad, a recent picture Aurangzeb's tomb is in the south-east angle of this courtyard. Facing it is a long low building similar to the one in the outer quadrangle, and in the north end is a small room containing the pall and decorations of the tomb. The grave lies immediately to the right of the entrance and is remarkably simple, in keeping with Aurangzeb's own wishes. The grave lies in the middle of a stone platform, raised about half a foot from the floor. Aurangzeb funded his resting place by knitting caps and copying the Qu‚Äôran, during the last years of his life, works which he sold anonymously in the market place. Unlike the other great Mughal rulers, Aurangzeb's tomb is not marked with a large mausoleum instead he was interred in an open air grave in accordance with his Islamic principles. The gateway and domed porch were added in 1760. The floor is of marble, A neat railing of perforated marble is on three sides, and the wall of Burhan-ud- din's dargah forms the fourth side. It was erected by the Nizam at the request of Lord Curzon, then Viceroy of India (who was shocked by the simplicity of the tomb) in the year 1911. On ceremonial occasions Aurangzeb's grave is draped with richly embroidered cloth but ordinarily it is covered by a white sheet. Close by on the right, are the tombs of Azam Shah, his wife and daughter. Tombs of Azam Shah and his wife Tomb of Azam Shah and his wife, Khuldabad A small marble enclosure, to the cast of Aurangzeb's tomb, contains the remains of Azam Shah and his wife. Azam was Aurangzeb's second son. Close by is another grave, said to be that of daughter of a Muhammedan saint. The marble screen contains 18 panels, each 6 feet in height. The sides and corners are surmounted by small minarets, also of marble. Marble is employed to pave the interior too and Azam Shah's grave has a small marble headstone ornamented with carved floral designs. Zainuddin Shirazi Dargah Midway between these tombs and that of Aurangzeb, is the mausoleum of Sayyed Zain ud din, a Muhammedan saint highly revered by the Muslims. On the east side it contains a number of verses inscribed from the Quran and the date of the saint's death, 771 H. (1370 A. D). Sheikh Zain-ud-din was born at Shiraz, in H. 701 and came to Delhi by way of Mecca. He studied under Maulana Kamal ud din of Samana and accompanied him to Daulatabad. He held the office of the Kazi at Daulatabad and in H. 737 was invested with the mantle of the Caliphate, but did not actually succeed till after Burhan-ud-din's death in H. 741. Zain-ud-din's sayings have bean recorded by Shaikh Husain in his Hidayatu-l-Kabul. The mausoleum was erected by his disciples much later. It is surrounded by a large quadrangular courtyard, and the enclosure has two gates chased with brass, silver and brass. The court has two mosques, one on a higher and the other on a lower level, a sloping pavement leading up to the former. There are open-fronted buildings on all sides, and a nagarkhana or a music chamber at the east end. The west end is used as a school where the Quran is taught. The doors of the shrine are inlaid with silver plates, and the step below is embellished with a number of curiously cut and polished stones. The grave inside is covered with a richly embroidered pall, and has the usual string of ostrich eggs suspended over it. A small room in an angle of the courtyard wall is said to contain the robe of the prophet, which is exhibited once a year on 12th Rabi-ul-awal. The relics of the parahan and the taj given to Burhan-ud-din on succeeding to the Caliphate we carefully preserved in a wooden box placed in one of the apartments of Zain-ud, din's dargah. Burhan ud din's Mausoleum Tomb of Sayyid Burhan-ud-din, Khuldabad Opposite the building which contains the tombs of Aurangzeb and Zain-ud-din, is another of almost equal interest. This has also a large quadrangular courtyard having open fronted building on all sides, and a nagarkhana at the east end. In the courtyard are two large drums. One of them is in fair order, while the parchment of the other has been destroyed and only the huge iron hemisphere remains. The west end of the quadrangle is used as a school and a door here gives access to an inner courtyard containing several graves. Facing the entrance is the tomb of Sayyad Burhan ud din, a Sufi Saint. Burhan-ud-din studied under Nizamuddin Auliya, the Sultan-ul-mashaikh of Delhi and was invested with the cap and the mantle, the symbols of the Kaliphat, in succession to the Sultan-ul-mashaikh. He migrated to Daulatabad in the wake of Muhammad Tughluq's transfer of capital from Delhi and later, made Khuldabad his abode, dying there in 744 H. (1344 A. D). Within the shrine are preserved some hair of the prophet's beard. The shrine doors are plated with plates of metal wrought into fanciful designs of trees and flowers. There is a mosque in front of the dargah. Within the town are dargahs to other Muslim saints like Muntajab ud din, Sayyad Yusuf etc. Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah's Tomb Tomb of Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I To the right of Burhan-ud-din's tomb are the resting places of Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah I, the founder of the Hyderabad dynasty, his second son Nasir Jang. The Hyderabad dynasty continued to rule from Hyderabad until after India won her independence, and of one of his consorts. They are covered with white cloth. The graves an on a platform of inlaid with white marble. A ten feet high screen of red porphyry surrounds them. Nasir Jang's tomb is on the left. It is surrounded by small scolloped arches of red porphyry. Bani Begum‚Äôs Makbara Banu Begum Garden 1860s Khuldabad To the west of this group of tombs is the Makbara of Bani Begum, the consort of one of Aurangzeb's son, with the Lall Bagh of Khan Jahan close by. The tomb of Bani Begam is in the centre of a large quadrangular garden. It is surrounded by a handsome wall with arched recesses on the inside. An elegant kiosk at each corner angle stands on eight pillars, and is surmountedby an Indo-Saracenic dome, fluted externally. The main entrance is in the centre of the north wall, and a mosque is in the south wall; while a corresponding open pavilion is in each of the remaining walls. The ground inside is laid out in the usual form of a garden, and contains cisterns and fountains, no longer in working order. The tomb of the Begum is within another walled enclosure in the middle of the garden, and has four small minarets around it. A pretty summer house in the centre of each wall in this wound enclosure, has sixteen slender but elegant pillars, supporting a domed roof in the curious form belonging to the Bengal style. There are, also specimens of perforated stone-work in the makbara. Khan Jahan‚Äôs Lall Bagh The Lall Bagh was built by Aurangzeb's foster-brother Khan Jahan, who was on two occasions Viceroy of the Dakhan, and died about the end of the 17th century. It resembles the garden containing Bani Begam's makbara, but is smaller, and has similar corner towers. The centre of each side wall has a building, one of which forms the gate, and contains a large dome in the centre, with a smaller dome on either side, add three minarets. A cistern in the centre of the enclosure, is connected by four long cisterns with the building in the middle of each wall; and the whole is adorned with fountains. \\"The water supply is obtained from the Roza tank, and first fills a cistern on the top of an adjoining house, from which it runs down a sloping pavement, into the garden.\\" The makbara of Khan Jahan is just above the garden, and the tombs of his relations are on the western side. A red porphyritic trap, and a cement of the same colour, have been used in the buildings, and hence the name Lall Bagh which has been given to the garden. Tomb of Malik Ambar Khuldabad Malik Ambar's Tomb Malik Ambar's dargah is to the north-west of the town and according to Ferishta it was erected during his lifetime. Nearby stands the tomb of his wife Bibi Karima. They are both in the Parther style of architecture and stand on raised platforms. The larger of the two contains the mortal remains of Malik Ambar and resembles Nizam Shah's dargah. Though the smaller is also of the same general appearance, it does not have the facade decorated with recesses and cusped arches in stucoo plaster. At a short distance from Malik Ambar's tomb is the open tomb of Tana Shah, the last of the Golkonda kings. To the north of the town is the tomb of Nizam Shah Bhairi which was converted into a trvelles' bungalow by the officers of the contingent stationed at Aurangabad during British days. The mausoleum at the base of the hill close by was erected for himself by Khoja Firoz while engaged in building the tomb of Nizam Shah Bhairi. The dargah of Ahmad Nizam Shah (1489‚Äì1509) is built on a raised platform and has an open court all round. It is quadrangular in plan, the walls rising high and plump with the parapet. A projecting string course divides the facade into two portions, the lower of which has three compartments on each face. Each compartment again has a rectangular recess covered by a horse-shoe arch. A cornice above projects well, and is supported on brackets. The parapet is pierced with tracery work; and the corner support little kiosks which look like miniature dargahs. While the summit is crowned with a little drum, the lower portion of the dome is adorned with lotus leaves. Zar Zari Zar Baksh and Ganj Rawan Ganj Baksh Dargah Tomb of Zar Zari Zar Baksh, Khuldabad, 1890s. The tomb of Zar Zari Baksh is between Malik Ambar's tomb and the northern gate of the town. It contains a number of ornaments and relics, the most remarkable of which is a circular looking-glass of steel mounted on a steel pedestal of four feet in height. It is said to have been presented by king Tana Shah. To the west of the town is the mausoleum of Ganj Ravan Ganj Baksh, believed to be the earliest Islamic saint of the district. He arrived towards the end of the 13th century about the time of Ala-ud-din's invasion of Devagiri. His dargah has the horse-shoe shaped dome of the Pathans, with piers on the faces supporting pointed arches. It stands on the band of Pari-ka-talav, also known as Ganj Ravan Talav. On the same side of the town is that of Sayyad Khalksar with a fine tank attached to it. The mausoleums of Abdal Halim and Kak Shahr, situated to the south of Khuldabad have some old pillars probably taken from the ruins of abandoned Hindu temples. A number of other decayed tombs are to the east and south of the town. On the anniversary day of the death of Zar Zari Zar Baksh an urus lasting for eight days is held. The articles exposed for sale consist of saris, brass and copper vessels and toys, including cutlery articles. The fair is attended by a large number of persons.

It was written by James Edward Grant. The film shares many cast and crew members and plot elements with the earlier Support Your Local Sheriff!, but is not a sequel. It actually parodies Yojimbo and its remake A Fistful of Dollars, using the basic storyline of a stranger who wanders into a feuding town and pretends to work as an enforcer for both sides. Garner later wrote the film was, \\"not as good as Support Your Local Sheriff\\". Plot Latigo Smith (Garner), a gambler and confidence man, is traveling by train in frontier-era Colorado with the rich and powerful Goldie (Marie Windsor). Goldie wants desperately to marry him, a fate of which he wants no part. He sneaks off the train at Purgatory, a small mining town. He discovers that two mining companies, run by bitter rivals Taylor Barton (Harry Morgan) and Colonel Ames (John Dehner), are vying to find a \\"mother lode\\" of gold buried somewhere nearby. Dynamite blasts periodically rock the town to its foundations. Latigo consults the town doctor (Dub Taylor) about an embarrassing problem that is not immediately revealed, but turns out to be a Goldie-related tattoo. Latigo's great weakness is a periodically uncontrollable urge to bet on roulette; he soon loses all of his money playing his \\"lucky\\" number, 23. Penniless, he starts romancing local saloonkeeper Miss Jenny (Joan Blondell). Being mistaken for infamous gunslinger \\"Swifty\\" Morgan gives Latigo an idea. He talks amiable ne'er-do-well Jug May (Jack Elam) into impersonating Swifty. Latigo attracts the attention of Patience Barton (Suzanne Pleshette), the hot-tempered daughter of Taylor, who desperately wants to escape her frontier existence, attend \\"Miss Hunter's College on the Hudson River, New York, for Young Ladies of Good Families\\", and live a life of refinement in New York City. When Latigo and Jug side with the Bartons in a dispute, Ames sends a telegram to the real Swifty Morgan (Chuck Connors), informing him of their deception. Swifty arrives in town and immediately challenges the hapless Jug to a gunfight, but at the appointed time and place, Latigo is there in his place, sitting atop a donkey loaded with crates of dynamite. Swifty calls Latigo's bluff, but he is startled by a warning about the next explosion and accidentally shoots himself. The blast also panics the donkey, which charges into a saloon/whorehouse, blowing up the building. The second blast uncovers the mother lode and removes Latigo's troublesome tattoo, leaving him uninjured. Latigo finally wins big at roulette after betting $10,000 on 23. Jug, talking to the camera from the back of a moving train taking Latigo and Patience to Denver to get married, reveals that Patience never did go to Miss Hunter's College, but seven of her daughters did. As for himself, Jug says he went on to become a big star in Italian Westerns.

Johnny suspects Tony B's involvement because one of his informants saw him near the scene of the crime. In a confrontation with Johnny, Tony makes up an alibi for Tony B. Johnny reluctantly accepts the story, but wordlessly threatens Tony if he finds out he is lying. In a session with Dr. Melfi, Tony's panic attacks are traced to his recent encounters with Tony B. He admits the truth about what really happened the night Tony B was arrested in the 1980s: Tony had a panic attack after arguing with his mother Livia and covered it up with a story of being beaten up by black men. Tony realizes that he has been assuaging his own guilt and shame. A faux pas causes tensions between Meadow's boyfriend, Finn DeTrolio, and Tony. After they make amends, Tony gets Finn a job at a mob-run construction site, where several members of his crew have \\"no-work\\" jobs. In the unfamiliar situation, Finn is uneasy. Uneasiness turns into fear after he witnesses a violent encounter between Eugene Pontecorvo and Little Paulie over homophobic jibes. The next day, Finn arrives at work early in the morning, and accidentally catches Vito performing oral sex on a male security guard. Later, Vito tries to coerce Finn into attending a New York Yankees game with him. Fearing for his life, Finn considers leaving New Jersey for the time being, prompting a heated argument with Meadow, which goes on through the night. Some time after four o'clock, he proposes to her. The night spent together by Tony and Carmela did not change anything: she finally decides to divorce and obtain her share of the assets. He is furious; looming over her he says, \\"You're entitled to shit.\\" After contacting several lawyers, Carmela realizes that Tony has consulted them all to prevent them from taking her case, and no forensic accountant is willing to assess his finances. She becomes tearful looking out the window at Tony floating in the swimming pool, while Meadow on the phone tells her about her engagement. Title reference Numerous misfortunes that members of the crime family have experienced, usually at one another's hands, are falsely blamed on black males. Four are mentioned in this episode: Tony's absence the night Tony B was arrested; the death of Jackie Aprile, Jr. in \\"Army of One\\"; Tony B's foot injury from the previous episode which he still suffers from in this episode; and the injuries Eugene causes to Little Paulie's head in this episode (Vito said, \\"What? I think I seen a couple of niggers runnin' that way!\\"). Connections to previous episodes * Finn was previously associated with an awkward discussion of homosexuality when he and Meadow defended a homo-erotic interpretation of Herman Melville's novel Billy Budd to Tony and Carmela at dinner in \\"Eloise.\\" * Christopher sang a few words of \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\" in the Season 4 episode \\"No Show,\\" beginning the opening verse as \\"If I were a carpenter, and you were a douchebag...\\" * Little Carmine dismisses suggestions to negotiate with Johnny Sack by saying: \\"This is not the U.N.\\" In the episode \\"Where's Johnny?\\", Johnny Sack responded to Tony's suggestion of a power-sharing arrangement: \\"What's this, the fuckin' U.N. now?!\\" * In Season 4, Episode 13, \\"Whitecaps,\\" Tony is advised to quickly consult all the best local lawyers so that they cannot represent his wife. He has apparently done so.

It is sometimes referred to as being the \\"American version\\" of the sport. Compared to the \\"British version\\" of the game ‚Äì which today is usually referred to as being the \\"international\\" version, or \\"softball\\" squash ‚Äì the hardball game is played using a harder rubber ball which plays faster, and usually on a smaller court for singles play, or a much larger court for the doubles game. Records of squash being played in Canada go back to the early 1880s. There it was found that the softer squash balls being used in Britain were not ideally suited to playing in the extremely cold conditions of the Canadian winter, and so a harder rubber ball was developed. It was quickly discovered that this ball was better suited to playing on slightly narrower courts than were used in the British version of the game. As the popularity of the game spread around Canada, the United States and Mexico, court specifications were codified. In 1924, it was decided to standardize the court width for the hardball games at , with a 'tin' at the bottom of the front wall which was high ‚Äì whereas the British version of the game was played on a , with a . By 1929, official court plans were being sold by the United States Squash Racquets Association (USSRA) (now called U.S. Squash), and the hardball game was brought into controlled growth. Hardball squash was largely the only form of the game played in North America until the 1980s. Growing exposure to the international version of the game then led to many clubs in North America building , and the \\"soft\\" ball being used on wide and narrow courts. Additionally, the USSRA recognised a as being acceptable for playing the international version (this width being derived from an increasing trend of converting racquetball courts for squash play). By the mid-1990s, the vast majority of squash players in North America had switched to playing the international version of the game. In 1996, 80% of squash ball sales in the United States were of the international-format balls. Though hardball squash is no longer a very popular game for singles play, the hardball doubles game continues to thrive. Hardball doubles is played on a court measuring and . Hardball doubles differs from singles in that the game is played up to 15 points and you do not have to win by 2 points. The strategy in hardball doubles differs from singles as well; where in singles squash the strategy is to keep the ball on the side wall, hardball doubles strategy is based on hitting attacking cross-court shots to move your 2 opponents around the court to create an opening to score.

There is also a community describing themselves of mixed ethnic origins (Cham, Khmer, Malay, Minang, Viet, Chinese and Arab), who practice Islam and are also known as Cham, or Cham Muslims, around the region of Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc in the Southwest. History Jamiul Muslimin Mosque, Ho Chi Minh City Uthman ibn Affan, the third Caliph of Islam, sent the first official Muslim envoy to Vietnam and Tang Dynasty China in 650. Seafaring Muslim traders are known to have made stops at ports in the Champa Kingdom en route to China very early in the history of Islam. After the Tang Dynasty collapsed, Abbasid Caliphate continued trading with the Vietnamese in Annam, later with ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát kingdom. however, the earliest material evidence of the transmission of Islam consists of Song Dynasty-era documents from China which record that the Cham familiarised themselves with Islam in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The number of followers began to increase as contacts with Sultanate of Malacca broadened in the wake of the 1471 collapse of the Champa Kingdom, but Islam would not become widespread among the Cham until the mid-17th century. On the same time, during the Mongol invasions of Vietnam, several Mongol generals were Muslims, including Omar Nasr al-Din; and the major bulk of Mongol army invading Vietnam came from the Turks and Persians. During their short conquest, the Mongols managed to spread Islam with a minimal decent, although it was never large enough to challenge the Vietnamese. In the mid-19th century, many Muslim Chams emigrated from Cambodia and settled in the Mekong Delta region, further bolstering the presence of Islam in Vietnam. Malayan Islam began to have an increasing influence on the Chams in the early 20th century; religions publications were imported from Malaya, Malay clerics gave khutba (sermons) in mosques in the Malay language, and some Cham people went to Malayan madrasah to further their studies of Islam. The Mekong Delta also saw the arrival of Malay Muslims. In 1832 the Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mang annexed the last Champa Kingdom. This resulted in the Cham Muslim leader Katip Suma, who was educated in Kelantan to declare a Jihad against the Vietnamese.(Extracted from Truong Van Mon, ‚ÄúThe Raja Praong Ritual: a Memory of the sea in Cham- Malay Relations‚Äù, in Memory And Knowledge Of The Sea In South Asia, Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences, University of Malaya, Monograph Series 3, pp, 97-111. International Seminar on Maritime Culture and Geopolitics & Workshop on Bajau Laut Music and Dance‚Äù, Institute of Ocean and Earth Sciences and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Malaya, 23-24/2008) The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will to punish them and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture. Cham Muslims and Hindus formed the Cham Liberation Front (Front de Liberation du Champa, FLC) led by the Muslim Lieutenant-Colonel Les Kosem to fight against both North and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War in order to obtain Cham independence. The Cham Liberation Front joined with the Montagnards and Khmer Krom to form the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (Front Uni de Lutte des Races Opprim√©es, FULRO) to fight the Vietnamese. After the 1976 establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, some of the 55,000 Muslim Chams emigrated to Malaysia. 1,750 were also accepted as immigrants by Yemen; most settled in Ta'izz. Those who remained did not suffer violent persecution, although some writers claim that their mosques were closed by the government. In 1981, foreign visitors to Vietnam were still permitted to speak to indigenous Muslims and pray alongside them, and a 1985 account described Ho Chi Minh City's Muslim community as being especially ethnically diverse: aside from Cham people, there were also Indonesians, Malays, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Yemenis, Omanis, and North Africans; their total numbers were roughly 10,000 at the time. Vietnam's second largest mosque was opened in January 2006 in Xu√¢n L·ªôc, ƒê·ªìng Nai Province; its construction was partially funded by donations from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the latter has a strong tie to Vietnam. A new mosque, the largest in Vietnam, in An Giang Province, the Kahramanlar Rahmet Mosque, was opened in 2017 with Turkish funds. According to the Cham advocacy group International Office of Champa (IOC-Champa) and Cham Muslim activist Khaleelah Porome, both Hindu and Muslim Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Th√†nh T√≠n and Ph∆∞∆°c Nh∆°n villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator. Cham Muslims in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalised, with ethnic Vietnamese settling on land previously owned by Cham people with state support. The Cham Suleiman Idres Bin called for independence of Champa from Vietnam and advocated for international intervention similar as to how East Timor independence was implemented by the United Nations. Due to the rising pro-American and pro-Western supports in Vietnam, and worrying about the spread of Islamic terrorism on the War on Terror, the United States and the West with other countries like India, Australia, have, instead, strongly supported Vietnam on territorial integrity, since most of Cham people are now Muslims. Adding with what Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaeda have done, and the fears over Myanmar's Rohingya crisis and Islamic insurgency in Thailand, most ignore the Cham's demands. Demographics A Vietnamese Muslim girl. Vietnam's April 1999 census showed 63,146 Muslims. Over 77% lived in the South Central Coast, with 34% in Ninh Thu·∫≠n Province, 24% in B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n Province, and 9% in Ho Chi Minh City; another 22% lived in the Mekong Delta region, primarily in An Giang Province. Only 1% of Muslims lived in other regions of the country. The number of believers is gender-balanced to within 2% in every area of major concentration except An Giang, where the population of Muslim women is 7.5% larger than the population of Muslim men.Census 1999, This distribution is somewhat changed from that observed in earlier reports. Prior to 1975, almost half of the Muslims in the country lived in the Mekong Delta, and as late as 1985, the Muslim community in Ho Chi Minh City was reported to consist of nearly 10,000 individuals. Of the 54,775 members of the Muslim population over age 5, 13,516, or 25%, were currently attending school, 26,134, or 48%, had attended school in the past, and the remaining 15,121, or 27%, had never attended school, compared to 10% of the general population. This gives Muslims the second-highest rate of school non-attendance out of all religious groups in Vietnam (the highest rate being that for Protestants, at 34%). The school non-attendance rate was 22% for males and 32% for females.Census 1999, Muslims also had one of the lowest rate of university attendance, with less than 1% having attended any institution of higher learning, compared to just under 3% of the general population.Census 1999, Official representation The Ho Chi Minh City Muslim Representative Committee was founded in 1991 with seven members; a similar body was formed in An Giang Province in 2004. Cultural appreciation Though Muslim community counted only just 1% of Vietnamese population and has been suffering communist oppression, the Vietnamese regard the Muslim community with a favorable opinion due to its tolerance approach. It's notable that religious worshipping locations, whenever located, can be found easily and get less harassment despite the communist's atheist policy. Ho Chi Minh City already has five major mosques and a Muslim district.

Performances Countdown The ceremony began with a countdown at the screen starting at 17, footage from previous games appeared with Melbourne at the end complete with an image of fireworks with numbers between 17 and 1 being from previous games until 0 from currents games * 17 - 1930 Hamilton * 16 - 1934 London * 15 - 1938 Sydney * 14 - 1950 Auckland * 13 - 1954 Vancouver * 12 - 1958 Cardiff * 11 - 1962 Perth * 10 - 1966 Kingston * 9 - 1970 Edinburgh * 8 - 1974 Christchurch * 7 - 1978 Edmonton * 6 - 1982 Brisbane * 5 - 1986 Edinburgh * 4 - 1990 Auckland * 3 - 1994 Victoria * 2 - 1998 Kuala Lumpur * 1 - 2002 Manchester  Music of Australia  The ceremony began with a fireworks show. This was followed by Grinspoon's Pat Davern suspended on the Great Southern Stand of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) playing a guitar (equipped with pyrotechnics which produced sparks) whilst being lowered onto the stadium ground, giving a rock concert feel to the closing ceremony. Grinspoon performed their hits Hard Act To Follow and Better Off Alone. During the performance under 18 TAC Cup Australian rules football players, accompanied by several contemporary key figures of the sport entered through a banner, running out into formation. Ballerinas dressed in club colours followed. Melbourne musician Paul Kelly performed Leaps and Bounds, while various costumed performers representing Melbournians entered the arena, in addition to a number of significant Melbourne landmark icons such as Flinders Street station, The Skipping Girl Vinegar Sign, St Kilda's Luna Park facade, the Royal Exhibition Building, the Melbourne Cup and the Victorian Arts Centre Spire. Ben Lee then performed a tribute to Melbourne's multicultural nature, performing We're All In This Together while people (known on-site as \\"Multis\\") held photoboards of their ancestors from the many different nationalities of Melbournians and created a \\"wall\\" with them. (Note: not all the people were holding their own ancestors. Most were assigned random photos. Those who had submitted photos got to hold their own.) Nearing the end of Ben Lee's song, the \\"Multis\\" took out large red and yellow paper flowers, alluding to Lee's upcoming video for the song. During the song, girls dressed in pink costumes, reminiscent of a 1980-1990's videos Kylie Minogue music video danced with large sweetheart lollies. These girls were known on-site as the \\"sweetheart girls\\". The Bodyrockers performed their hit I Like the Way (You Move) while the \\"multis\\" and \\"sweetheart girls\\" performed separate dances. Towards the end of the song, the multis moved from the front of the stage to the middle, flipping their boards over and revealing a giant moving version of Federation Square, also using the boards to create an audience wave (Mexican wave). They finished up, holding poses, as fireworks were set off around the MCG. Fireworks were alluded to during the ceremony, with small explosions taking place throughout the event. The volunteers were then welcomed and thanked, with 14,000 being invited to the closing ceremony, while a poem was read out listing a few more of Melbourne's icons, such as the Esplanade Hotel, Graham Kennedy and Shane Warne. The volunteers were honoured as being an integral part of the games success. Confetti snow rained down on the stage, representing the fickle nature of Melbourne's weather, as Sarah Blasko performed a Neil Finn and Crowded House hit, Don't Dream It's Over. Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys played \\"Rally around the Drum\\", before flag bearers for each country raised flags, in the same order of continental region that they had done in the opening ceremony, starting with England and finishing with Australia. An illuminated globe suspended in the centre was lowered with Australia, upside down, highlighted in red, and on top of the world. Notably, Melbourne City Council's Mayor, Lord Mayor John So was included in the proceedings, to rapturous applause of the crowd, who continued to cheer as his name was read out throughout the ceremony. The Commonwealth Games Ceremonial Flag was lowered by workers representing the Emergency Services of Victoria to the backing of a Wurundjeri Indigenous traditional song performed by the Gondwana Voices, a national youth choir. Welcoming Delhi 2010 The ceremony took a distinct change, in acknowledgment of the 2010 Commonwealth Games which will be held in Delhi. A short promotional video was displayed extolling the virtues of India. The stage was filled with the sights and sounds of the Bollywood film culture, with colour and dance predominant features. Several colourful performances were displayed, such as the lively bhangra by Rani Mukherjee and Saif Ali Khan as well as a dance by Aishwarya Rai, who is a Bollywood and Hollywood actress, a supermodel and Miss World 1994. The 2010 Delhi Games mascot, Shera the Friendly Tiger paraded around the stage waving at the crowd, accompanied by the Miss Universe 2000, Lara Dutta and the Miss World 2000, Priyanka Chopra. Then the theme song was performed on stage. The song was sung by popular Indian singers Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan and Shiamak Davar. The latter is also a famous dance choreographer in India. The song, called \\"Delhi Chalein\\" invites everyone to the next Commonwealth Games in Delhi.  David Dixon Award  The David Dixon Award, for Best and Fairest, was awarded to Indian Commonwealth Games Team shooter, Samaresh Jung. As the Indian shooter had already returned to India, the award trophy was handed over to an Indian Olympic Association official as the representative.  Closing of the games  Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex then officially closed the Games. Concluding performances The Boy and White Duck from the opening ceremony returned and the boy, who was holding the duck, went down a trapdoor at the centre of the stage and disappeared from sight, symbolizing the closing of the 2006 Games. Casey Donovan, the winner of the 2004 Australian Idol, performed Better To Love. Michael Klim then came on stage to respond on behalf of the athletes. He was interrupted, mid-sentence, by Barry Humphries (as Dame Edna Everage). Michael Klim's interrupted speech was never finished. Dame Edna Everage read a message, and a poem and then sang a song in tribute to Melbourne, via video, while 1,000 so-called \\"Commonwealth Dames\\", wearing various costumes, some from the beginning of the show, performed on the circular stage, waving gladioli and dancing. During this, many fireworks were set off, finally ending in a large human formation in the shape of Dame Edna's trademark glasses. The athletes danced and partied around the centre stage, many of them taking advantage of the informal procedures to take photos, and celebrate in the festivities. Then a select number of outer circle volunteers speared inwards to form a heart-shaped enclosure, while Melbourne's larger skyscrapers set fireworks alight - mirroring the opening ceremony. The floating fish of the Yarra River were illuminated one final time. The official goodbye was announced, and the ceremony ended. The President of the Commonwealth Games Committee, Mike Fennell, declared to the crowd, \\"Melbourne, you are simply the best!\\" The stage then cleared, with the volunteers surrounding the centre platform, with John Farnham singing his hit Age of Reason, followed by a set of Farnham songs, finishing with his anthem song, You're the Voice. A month after the ceremony, all the Melbourne performers received certificates of participation.

In optics, defocus is the aberration in which an image is simply out of focus. This aberration is familiar to anyone who has used a camera, videocamera, microscope, telescope, or binoculars. Optically, defocus refers to a translation of the focus along the optical axis away from the detection surface. In general, defocus reduces the sharpness and contrast of the image. What should be sharp, high-contrast edges in a scene become gradual transitions. Fine detail in the scene is blurred or even becomes invisible. Nearly all image-forming optical devices incorporate some form of focus adjustment to minimize defocus and maximize image quality.  In optics and photography  The degree of image blurring for a given amount of focus shift depends inversely on the lens f-number. Low f-numbers, such as to 2.8, are very sensitive to defocus and have very shallow depths of focus. High f-numbers, in the 16 to 32 range, are highly tolerant of defocus, and consequently have large depths of focus. The limiting case in f-number is the pinhole camera, operating at perhaps 100 to 1000, in which case all objects are in focus almost regardless of their distance from the pinhole aperture. The penalty for achieving this extreme depth of focus is very dim illumination at the imaging film or sensor, limited resolution due to diffraction, and very long exposure time, which introduces the potential for image degradation due to motion blur. The amount of allowable defocus is related to the resolution of the imaging medium. A lower-resolution imaging chip or film is more tolerant of defocus and other aberrations. To take full advantage of a higher resolution medium, defocus and other aberrations must be minimized. Defocus is modeled in Zernike polynomial format as a(2 \\\\rho^2-1), where a is the defocus coefficient in wavelengths of light. This corresponds to the parabola-shaped optical path difference between two spherical wavefronts that are tangent at their vertices and have different radii of curvature. For some applications, such as phase contrast electron microscopy, defocused images can contain useful information. Multiple images recorded with various values of defocus can be used to examine how the intensity of the electron wave varies in three- dimensional space, and from this information the phase of the wave can be inferred. This is the basis of non-interferometric phase retrieval. Examples of phase retrieval algorithms that use defocused images include the Gerchberg‚ÄìSaxton algorithm and various methods based on the transport-of- intensity equation.  In vision  In casual conversation, the term blur can be used to describe any reduction in vision. However, in a clinical setting blurry vision means the subjective experience or perception of optical defocus within the eye, called refractive error. Blur may appear differently depending on the amount and type of refractive error. The following are some examples of blurred images that may result from refractive errors: Image:Specrx- letterscamblur.png Image:Specrx-lettersastigblur.png Image:Specrx- lettersastigblur2.png Image:Specrx-letterseyeblur.png The extent of blurry vision can be assessed by measuring visual acuity with an eye chart. Blurry vision is often corrected by focusing light on the retina with corrective lenses. These corrections sometimes have unwanted effects including magnification or reduction, distortion, color fringes, and altered depth perception. During an eye exam, the patient's acuity is measured without correction, with their current correction, and after refraction. This allows the optometrist or ophthalmologist (\\"eye doctor\\") to determine the extent refractive errors play in limiting the quality of the patient's vision. A Snellen acuity of 6/6 or 20/20, or as decimal value 1.0, is considered to be sharp vision for an average human (young adults may have nearly twice that value). Best-corrected acuity lower than that is an indication that there is another limitation to vision beyond the correction of refractive error.  The blur disk  Optical defocus can result from incorrect corrective lenses or insufficient accommodation, as, e.g., in presbyopia from the aging eye. As said above, light rays from a point source are then not focused to a single point on the retina but are distributed in a little disk of light, called the blur disk. Its size depends on pupil size and amount of defocus, and is calculated by the equation d=0.057 p D (d = diameter in degrees visual angle, p = pupil size in mm, D = defocus in diopters). In linear systems theory, the point image (i.e. the blur disk) is referred to as the point spread function (PSF). The retinal image is given by the convolution of the in-focus image with the PSF.

She is played by American actress Leisha Hailey. Alice lives in Los Angeles, California, and mostly hangs out in West Hollywood. During the first seasons, she is often seen with her best friends, Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig) and Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels). Further into the show, she befriends Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley), and has romantic relationships with various recurrent lead characters, most notably Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels) and Tasha Williams (Rose Rollins). She was listed in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Storylines Backstory Alice is a journalist for LA Magazine. Among her group of lesbian friends, she is the only self-proclaimed bisexual. Her bisexual mother Lenore is an actress, and the only one in the family who accepts Alice's sexuality. Alice is estranged from her two siblings, who disapprove of bisexuality, as well as her father, whom she simply describes as \\"distant\\". Alice is obsessed with The Chart, a recompilation of all the relationships and one-night stands which she knows of, and how this network of affairs is linked to her. Alice strongly believes everyone is sleeping with everyone else, and her chart is the most valuable evidence supporting her theory. The L Word Alice briefly dates a transwoman, Lisa. She soon decides that her true feelings lie with Dana Fairbanks, who does not love her back and who was then engaged to her fiance Tanya. Shortly after Dana and Tanya announce their engagement, Alice visits Dana and impulsively kisses her; taking advantage of Alice's feelings, Dana kisses her back and begins an affair with her behind Tanya's back, and with Alice's pushing, Dana eventually splits up with Tanya (made easier when Tanya casually admits she had been cheating on Dana as well, implying that Tanya was only interested in Dana for her money). Though the two seem happy in their relationship, Dana's ex, Lara, comes back at the end of the second season, raising Alice's suspicions, particularly when Dana shows surprise at Alice's suggestion that they live together and refuses to say she loves her. Though Dana confides in Alice that she wants to visit Lara to talk and get closure on their past relationship, Alice's fears are realized when it turns out in the third season that Dana lied to her and her visit to Lara was to resume their relationship behind Alice's back; she is subsequently left devastated to the point of stalking and obsessing over Dana, despite her friends' attempts to get her to move on. She has a brief affair with a woman named Uta, whom Alice becomes convinced is a vampire, and is slowly able to overcome her heartbreak, but Dana is later diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, and in her depression she spitefully shuns Lara, as they can no longer have sex, though she gradually starts to repair her friendship with Alice. Dana eventually dies, leaving Alice and the others devastated. Alice, who by now has broken up with Uta, has a short affair with Lara out of simple comfort, but they end it out of respect for Dana. Alice begins video podcasting on OurChart and discovers a woman named Papi who has the highest amount of sexual encounters on the chart. Through her, she later meets and starts dating Tasha Williams, a Captain in the Army National Guard. During a confrontation between Papi's friends in Alice's apartment, Tasha accidentally hits her while trying to break up a fight and has to take her to the hospital. While at the hospital Alice learns of Tasha's military background and the two get into an argument over a disagreement about the ethics of the war in Iraq. Despite their differences in politics, they choose to continue their relationship as, in Alice's words, they enjoy having sex. The following season, after Alice is seen in public with Tasha by one of her homophobic subordinates at work and openly has a lover's disagreement with her while on base she is drawn into Tasha's Army investigation for homosexual conduct. During the investigation, two Army investigators come to her apartment and start to invade her privacy looking for evidence of Tasha having a lesbian relationship with her. Alice asks the officers to leave and then proceeds to hide evidence of her relationship with Tasha in case they return with a search warrant. In response, Tasha goes to her lawyer's house and berates him for not giving her prior warning of the visit by the investigators. Alice is invited to a party for closeted homosexual celebrities and, despite signing a non-disclosure agreement, captures a video of Daryl Brewer, an NBA player, in an intimate moment with another man. Later, Tasha and Alice watch Brewer make homophobic remarks on the news in response to another NBA player coming out, and Tasha disapproves. Alice callously puts the incriminating video on her podcast; it goes viral and Alice becomes the center of a media storm for outing Brewer, subsequently destroying his career and his family. Alice defends her actions on a national news broadcast. This angers Tasha because it jeopardizes her Army investigation and opens another rift in her relationship with Alice. Shortly after, Alice and Tasha decide they can no longer be together. During Tasha's separation board for homosexual conduct, Alice testifies in front of Colonel Gillian Davis, who herself is implied to be a closeted lesbian, and makes a statement about being outed that caused Davis to back off on trying to get Tasha discharged. However, Tasha decided that she no longer wanted to serve in the Army if she cannot be with the person she loves and admits to the board that she is indeed in love with Alice, effectively outing herself and resulting in her discharge. After Tasha is discharged from the Army under Don't ask, don't tell, they continue their relationship where it left off, though it's a little unsteady. Just about the same time, Alice gets a host spot on a TV show called \\"The Look\\", where she meets Clea Mason, a New Zealand clothing designer. Alice develops an instant attraction to her, but decides to resist those feelings in order to work on her relationship with Tasha. As Alice and Tasha's relationship continues to wane, she tries her best to make things work. An encounter with Gabby Deveaux at Papi's house on the season premiere triggers Alice to admit her troubled past, and to refuse to part ways with Tasha. They are shown visiting the show's recurrent therapist Dan Foxworthy, who decrees their relationship to be ill-fated. Nonetheless they try to stick together. Also on this season, Alice has decided to venture into the film business by writing a treatment on a killer idea she had. A potential conflict of interest with Jenny is hinted as a not-very-excited Schecter is suggested as a reviewer for the treatment by Tina. Jenny later diminishes Alice's treatment as unoriginal. But when Jenny eventually writes and sells a script featuring the exact premise of Alice's treatment, Alice is furious and gives an ultimatum to Shane, who is now romantically involved with Jenny, to dump Jenny or lose their long-standing friendship. In her job as a host on The Look, Alice reads a letter on the air from a girl whose brother was killed in a hate crime because he sent a love letter to another boy. This results in her being fired, but also results in a call from a woman named Jamie Chen, who works at a Gay and Lesbian Center, to help talk the letter writer off a ledge. Alice becomes more heavily involved with the center after doing this, and she and Tasha become fast friends with Jamie. It becomes obvious to some of Alice's friends that Alice, Jaime and Tasha are all becoming attracted to each other, but as time passes, Alice begins to suspect that the attraction between Tasha and Jamie, who are much more closely matched than either woman with Alice, is stronger. After the three friends lose a dance contest at the charity dance for the Gay & Lesbian Center that they orchestrated, Alice tearfully tells Tasha to pursue a relationship with Jamie, and then again presents this idea during a later lunch meeting with the pair, where Jaime admits that she has fallen in love with Tasha, while Tasha responds with silence, leaving it ambiguous as to whether or not she reciprocates Jaime's feelings. Though Tasha insists that she does not want to do this, she swears at Alice when she accuses her of fantasizing about Jaime. Remembering how Dana previously abused and betrayed her feelings, Alice angrily tells Tasha to make a decision and leaves, in effect letting her go. When Tasha does not immediately contact her, Alice assumes that she has chosen Jamie. She attends Bette and Tina's going away party, as they are moving to New York, and tells her friends that she has decided to make peace with Jenny for Shane's sake. However, it is Alice who first alerts the party guests to the discovery of Jenny's body in Bette and Tina's pool. Tasha arrives at the party and comforts Alice, having ultimately chosen her over Jaime. The series ends with the group of women being questioned by interrogating police officers regarding Jenny's death, smiling to themselves to finally be rid of Jenny and her manipulations.  The Interrogation Tapes  Over a month after the series ends, footage of Alice's police interrogation appears on Showtime's L Word website (\\"The Interrogation Tapes\\"). In the footage, Alice explains to the interrogating police officers how she met Bette years ago, and how her own bisexuality still exists (even though she is more attracted to women). She then blurts out how she didn't understand what any of this line of questioning had to do with who killed Jenny, which prompts Sergeant Duffy to reply with a question of why Alice assumed the death was in fact a murder. The Farm spin-off A pilot for a proposed spin-off of The L Word entitled \\"The Farm\\", starring Leisha Hailey as Alice, was filmed. Substantially different from its parent show, the story revolved around Alice going to prison after being tried and convicted for Jenny's murder (a crime that Alice continued to deny committing) before later centering on the jail setting itself with an entire cast of new characters. It was announced in April, 2009 that Showtime had declined to pick up The Farm as a series. The L Word: Generation Q Over ten years after Jenny's death, Alice has relocated to Los Angeles and is the host of a new talk show, \\"Alice\\". It is also revealed that, under unknown circumstances, she ultimately broke up with Tasha, as she is shown to have settled down with Nat, though she does not get on well with Nat's adopted children or with Gigi, Nat's meddling ex-wife and the children's biological mother. After Bette's campaign to become Mayor of Los Angeles is threatened when one of her previous sexual affairs is exposed, Alice invites Bette to appear on her talk show to tell her side of the story. Meanwhile, Alice becomes closer to Gigi and learns that Nat and Gigi's relationship ended when Gigi cheated on her (though Nat was also having a secret affair with Alice at the time as well). Feeling sympathetic, Alice suggests that Nat and Gigi spend more time together to renew their friendship, against Shane's advice, but Alice becomes jealous when Nat and Gigi start to enjoy each other's company and snub her, fearing that Nat will betray her for Gigi as Dana betrayed her for Lara. At Shane's 40th birthday party, the three get drunk and end up having a threesome, but in the aftermath, Nat and Gigi find difficulties in overcoming their differences due to Gigi's previous infidelity and they enter a three-way relationship. However, Gigi continues to spite Nat at every opportunity, such as outing their status to strangers and kissing Alice before informing the children. Alice offers her support to Nat, who tells Alice she loves her and does not want to lose her. Meanwhile, Alice is informed that her show is approaching cancellation due to the fiasco between Bette, Felicity and Tyler, and that same night, she returns home to find Nat and Gigi having sex without her. Distraught, Alice moves in with Shane for a few days until she finally answers Nat's calls for a lunch meeting. Nat and Gigi reveal to Alice that they have overcome their differences and that they want to continue being polyamorous, but when Alice discovers that Gigi has actually been living with Nat during those days and the two have been having sex frequently without her, she openly accuses Nat of only using her sexually for the past two years to get over her heartbreak from Gigi's infidelity, and angrily leaves. Alice later learns that her show is on the verge of cancellation, and goes against the producers' wishes and invites Roxane Gay on her show. During the interview, she reveals Nat and Gigi's betrayal, at which point Nat reveals herself in the audience and goes onto the stage to tell Alice that she loves her and wants to work on their relationship without Gigi, having discovered that Gigi was only out to destroy Alice and Nat's relationship out of spite. Alice forgives Nat and the video footage goes viral, saving the show.

Senac Creek and other minor streams flow into the reservoir's three coves, Senac, Marina and Lone Tree, each pointing to the south. The reservoir provides drinking water to the City of Aurora, and is also a recreation area. History Filled in 1990, the reservoir provides drinking water for the City of Aurora, which it also uses as a recreational facility. Miles of undeveloped prairie originally separated the reservoir from the city's neighborhoods, and its location has been referred to as \\"Aurora's Outback\\". However, over 3,500 new homes in the two new suburban communities, Beacon Point and Southshore are currently under construction immediately southwest of the reservoir, in addition to much other development in the area including the Southlands Lifestyle Center (approx west of the reservoir), Cherokee Trail High School and Fox Ridge Middle School (1/2 mile southwest) and thousands of other homes in the vicinity. Recreation The rapid Southeastern expansion of the Denver‚ÄìAurora Metropolitan Area has greatly increased attendance and awareness of the reservoir. Many recreational opportunities exist at Aurora Reservoir. There is a small swim beach open seasonally, boat dock, rental equipment shack, jogging/biking trail, designated SCUBA diving beach/area in water, and many opportunities for fishermen. In order to protect the purity of the water, only electric boats are allowed, thus limiting full recreational use of the reservoir. Surprisingly, the reservoir is also a relatively popular diving site, largely due to the separate SCUBA beach and designated area in the far Northeastern corner of the lake and also because of a Cessna 310, deliberately sunk in 1994 as a diving attraction,Hurley, Mike. \\"Aurora Reservoir, CO.\\" Sport Diver Oct. 1994: 92‚Äì94 visible at only below the surface. Not surprisingly, it is a popular location for local SCUBA centers to take dive students for their open- water certification. More recently, the reservoir has also become a reputable fishing spot mainly for Trout, Walleye and Catfish, and has truly been in the limelight lately regarding the record for largest catfish caught in Colorado being set at the reservoir in October 2010. The reservoir also hosts a number of community events throughout the year including triathlons, sailing camps, and other local functions.

The title track found the Swirling Eddies in search of the elusive Elvis Presley who, according to the song, escaped the city by faking his own death and decided to make his home in the wilderness. The song makes parallels between the search for Elvis, the search for Bigfoot and mankind's search for a king or \\"savior.\\" This project gave the Swirling Eddies their first hit songs - \\"Driving In England\\" which made it all the way to #1 in some markets, and \\"Hide the Beer, the Pastor's Here\\" which also created a small amount of controversy for the album. The latter song tells the tale of a Christian College professor that hides his own hidden sins and attacks his students for their obvious drinking habits. At the end of the song, \\"Spot\\" shouts out the name of Christian Colleges around the United States. Some of these colleges were upset that they were mentioned in the song while others were upset that they weren't included. One song on the album, \\"Mystery Babylon,\\" had earlier been premiered on the Swirling Eddies Apology Video, which had been sent out to fans that ordered the Spittle & Phlegm video collection. Outdoor Elvis marks the first appearance of new Swirling Eddies member Prickly Disco. It is also the first appearance of the guest Eddie known as Miracle Babe, whom contributes background vocals on the album.

He held degrees from Oberlin College, the Eastman School, and the University of Rochester (PhD). His composition teachers included Howard Hanson and Alan Hovhaness. For Asian music and dance he studied with Dorothy Kahananui and Halla Huhm. Dr. Diercks taught piano at the College of Wooster (1950‚Äì54), then began a long tenure at Hollins University, teaching theory and composition. He served as department chair from 1962 until 1990. Among many grants and awards he has received are those from the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Mellon and Danforth foundations (five times), the Southern Foundation for the Humanities, and ASCAP (fifteen times). As a composer he has enjoyed residence at the MacDowell Colony, Wolf Trap Farm, and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. Much of Diercks‚Äô music is influenced by exoticism, including microtonality and ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù musical sounds. An early work, Cave Music for vocalise and three players on prepared piano, accompanied a dance performed in Virginia‚Äôs Dixie Caverns and broadcast on NBC-TV‚Äôs Today Show. His Twelve Sonatinas, performed by pianist Marthanne Verbit, are in the catalog of Albany Records. In 2009 the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America published his Fugue in C (for Elizabeth Graves Vitu) and Fantasia (commissioned by the University of Iowa-Ames). Over 125 of Dr. Diercks‚Äô music has been published, for piano, voice, choral, chamber ensemble, and carillon. He has written more than two hundred reviews and articles in newspapers and journals, and authored two chapters published in the Denes Agay book ‚ÄúTeaching Piano‚Äù. Diercks lived in Honolulu, and served as president of the Hawaii Music Teachers Association from 1992-96.

The arm may be supplied by blood flowing in a retrograde direction down the vertebral artery at the expense of the vertebrobasilar circulation. This is called the subclavian steal. It is more severe than typical vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  Signs and symptoms  * Presyncope (sensation that one is about to faint) * Syncope (fainting) * Neurologic deficits * Blood pressure differential between the arms * severe memory problems * hands showing circulation problems (hands can have blotchy patches of red and white) (associated with other stigmata of vascular disease (e.g. vascular insufficiency ulcers of the fingers). Causes * Atherosclerosis * Cervical rib * Takayasu's arteritis  Pathophysiology  Classically, SSS is a consequence of a redundancy in the circulation of the brain and the flow of blood. SSS results when the short low resistance path (along the subclavian artery) becomes a high resistance path (due to narrowing) and blood flows around the narrowing via the arteries that supply the brain (left and right vertebral artery, left and right internal carotid artery). The blood flow from the brain to the upper limb in SSS is considered to be stolen as it is blood flow the brain must do without. This is because of collateral vessels. As in vertebral-subclavian steal, coronary-subclavian steal may occur in patients who have received a coronary artery bypass graft using the internal thoracic artery (ITA), also known as internal mammary artery. As a result of this procedure, the distal end of the ITA is diverted to one of the coronary arteries (typically the LAD), facilitating blood supply to the heart. In the setting of increased resistance in the proximal subclavian artery, blood may flow backward away from the heart along the ITA, causing myocardial ischemia due to coronary steal. Vertebral-subclavian and coronary-subclavian steal can occur concurrently in patients with an ITA CABG.  Hemodynamics  Blood, like electric current, flows along the path of least resistance. Resistance is affected by the length and width of a vessel (i.e. a long, narrow vessel has the greatest resistance and a short, wide one the least), but crucially in the human body width is generally more limiting than length because of Poiseuille's Law. Thus, if blood is presented with two paths, a short one that is narrow (with a high overall resistance) and a long one that is wide (with a low overall resistance), it will take the long and wide path (the one with the lower resistance).  Vascular anatomy  The blood vessels supplying the brain arise from the vertebral arteries and internal carotid arteries and are connected to one another by communicating vessels that form a circle (known as the circle of Willis).  Blood flow  Normally, blood flows from the aorta into the subclavian artery, and then some of that blood leaves via the vertebral artery to supply the brain. In SSS a reduced quantity of blood flows through the proximal subclavian artery. As a result, blood travels up one of the other blood vessels to the brain (the other vertebral or the carotids), reaches the basilar artery or goes around the cerebral arterial circle and descends via the (contralateral) vertebral artery to the subclavian (with the proximal blockage) and feeds blood to the distal subclavian artery (which supplies the upper limb and shoulder).

Its approximate boundaries are the Arabian Sea on the West, the Kallai river on the South, Vellayil(a fishing village) on the North, and the Kozhikode town on the East. The Kallai river flows through the south side of Kuttichira. An iron railway bridge constructed across the river was built by the British, and later renovated by Indian railways. There is a large pool called Kuttichira, which attracts many visitors. Kuttichira also houses some of the largest and oldest Tharavadus, which are traditional joint family houses. Many of these houses have more than 20 rooms and some of them are even equipped with swimming pools. Two ancient mosques, Muchundi Mosque and Mishkal Mosque are used as private places of worship. The Big Bazar, one of the oldest and biggest trading lanes in Malabar is located here. Kuttichirabeach and the Port Light House are easily accessible from this place. Mishkal Mosque Muchundi Mosque, Kuttichira People Most of the inhabitants in Kuttichira are Muslims, mostly belonging to the Koya subdivision of Mappila community of Kerala. They follow a unique marriage and joint family system in this area: women continue to live in their ancestral home after marriage and their puthiaplas (husbands) move in. For every marriage in the family, a room is added to the house. The newly added room is called Maniyara(wedlock room). Some houses here have more than six added rooms to accommodate the multiple weddings. Historically, Koyas were traders and have a near monopoly in the big bazaar of Kozhikode. More than 20% of the inhabitants are working abroad (mainly in the Middle-East) and their remittances play a big part in the local economy. Places of interest Mishkal Mosque located here is one of the oldest mosques in Kerala and was built by a rich Arab businessman named Nakhooda Mishkal, nearly 650 years ago.'Mishkal Mosque' There are many examples of mosque architecture along the Kuttichira \\"Kolam\\" (pond). Tagged the \\"Juma Masjid\\" series, these masjids depict the lifestyle and culture of early inhabitants of the place. The masterpieces of local sculptors can be found in the interiors of the \\"Tharavadus\\" and mosques.

It stars Ky-Mani Marley, Spragga Benz, Paul Campbell and Louie Rankin and was written and directed by Cess Silvera. Despite its low budget, the distribution of an unfinished bootleg made it a cult favourite long before its official limited release in the United States by Triumph Films and Destination Films in 2006. Plot The film tells the story of two young men, Biggs (Errol) (Ky-Mani Marley) and Wayne (Spragga Benz), who grow up together in the tough and dangerous streets of (Waterhouse) Kingston. They rob a soda truck and shoot the truck driver while they are still children. The robbery money is used to purchase visas to go the United States, where they continue their criminal activities, hustling on the streets of Miami. Twenty years later, Biggs is then deported to Jamaica where Wayne and Mad Max (Paul Campbell), also deported, have continued their surge in crime, they begin to extort money from business people. After facing problems with the police and politicians, the two head back to Miami alongside Mad Max. Upon returning, they are informed that Miami has a new king, Teddy Bruck Shut (Louie Rankin). The three pay Teddy a visit to extort him. They extort, beat, and murder their way to the top of the Miami underworld. Their dream ends in a brazen shoot out, during which Teddy's thugs kill Wayne and shoot Max who also eventually dies. Biggs almost gets shot as he comforts Wayne at his deathbed, but Max shoots the assailant before it happens. After taking Max to the hospital, Biggs goes to Teddy's house and murders him, his bodyguard and his girlfriend. Biggs then takes all the money and gets on a boat where only the audience can presume he leaves to Los Angeles as he mentioned purchasing a house there earlier before the massive firefight broke out.

It occupies the Val Gardena within the Dolomites, a mountain chain that is part of the Alps. Geography Urtij√´i borders the following municipalities: Kastelruth, Villn√∂√ü, Lajen and Santa Cristina Gherd√´ina.  History  The Ladin-language name Urtij√´i derives from the Latin word urtica and the suffix -etum with the meaning \\"place of nettles\\". From 1860 to 1914 Urtij√´i experienced a relevant economical growth due to the opening of a major road connecting Val Gardena to the main railroad; as a result the local woodcarving industry flourished. International tourism developed through the discovery of the Dolomites first by English tourists, and subsequently visitors from other parts of Austria-Hungary as well as the German Empire. Currently, the town's economy is mostly based on winter skiing tourism, summer hiking tourism, and woodcarving.

Tony spends more time at her club and, with Christopher out of town on a cigarette smuggling job, is alone with her in her office. The two bond over recent problems and snort cocaine together. There is sexual tension: they are about to kiss‚Äîwhen there is a knock at the door. Phil and Joey have arrived for a meeting. Tony resumes his psychiatric therapy; he tells Dr. Melfi that a relationship with Adriana would lead to problems with both Chris and Carmela. \\"I was able to control myself,\\" he says. Melfi commends Tony for this \\"milestone\\": he avoided doing something destructive. On the eve of Chris's return, Tony and Adriana drive to Dover to buy cocaine. Tony swerves to avoid a raccoon, and his SUV flips over to the driver's side. Tony is released from the hospital unhurt. Adriana is bruised and has a head injury. Tony suggests a cover story to explain why they were alone together in the early morning: they were going to get something to eat. However, Tony's crew and their associates play an unintentional game of \\"telephone\\" with the story of the accident. The details get more elaborate and lurid with each retelling; the final version is that Adriana was fellating him when the accident happened. Chris learns of the accident from his crew and is immediately suspicious. At Satriale's he loses his temper and nearly starts a fight with Vito, who is now a capo. At a face-to-face meeting, Tony turns the conversation against Chris, telling him he does not deserve a woman as good- looking as Adriana. He swears on his children that nothing is going on. At home, Adriana admits that she and Tony were going to see her drug dealer, but insists that nothing happened between them. Chris slaps her hard and physically throws her out. He then relapses. Chris, drunk, arrives at the Bing and empties his pistol into Tony's car before entering the club, where he is over-powered. Tony and his crew take him to the Meadowlands, where Tony prepares to execute him if he doesn't acknowledge that nothing happened. However, at Tony B's suggestion, Chris is taken to the doctor who treated Tony and Adriana on the night of the accident. Though under pressure, the doctor freely acknowledges that Adriana's injuries show that she was wearing her seatbelt and sitting upright when the accident occurred. Chris, though placated, feels like a laughing stock. Agent Sanseverino, believing the final version of the story of Adriana and Tony, wants Adriana to exploit their \\"relationship,\\" and the FBI wants to plant listening devices in her club. Adriana verbally explodes at her and moves to get out of the car. As she is leaving, Sanseverino tries to warn her that by staying with Chris she is protecting her abuser. \\"If it had been Christopher alone in the car with a woman,\\" Adriana says, \\"I would have killed him.\\" Tony convinces Carmela that there is nothing between him and Adriana. In a show of unity, Tony and Carmela, Chris and Adriana, and Tony B and Quintina Blundetto arrive to dine at Nuovo Vesuvio, where most of Tony's crew are eating at other tables. Vito approaches them and shakes Chris' hand, wishing him a pleasant evening, and it seems that all fences have been mended.

Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor is a National Heritage Corridor dedicated to the history of the early American Industrial Revolution, including mill towns stretching across 24 cities and towns (400,000 acres (1,620 km¬≤) in total) near the river's course in Worcester County, Massachusetts and Providence County, Rhode Island. It makes up a historical area in the Blackstone Valley and is named for the late US Senator from Rhode Island John Chafee. In 2014, the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park was created out of a smaller portion of the National Heritage Corridor. Both units now exist as cooperative entities. The organization is headquartered at the building in Woonsocket Depot Square which is located at 1 Depot Square, Woonsocket, RI 02895. History River Bend Farm Visitors Center, Blackstone River and Canal State Park, Uxbridge, Massachusetts The National Corridor was designated by an Act of Congress on November 10, 1986 to preserve and interpret for present and future generations the unique and significant value of the Blackstone Valley. It includes cities, towns, villages and almost one million people. The Federal government does not own or manage any of the land or resources in the corridor as it does in the more traditional national parks. Instead the National Park Service, two state governments, dozens of local municipalities, businesses, nonprofit historical and environmental organizations, educational institutions, many private citizens, and a Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor Commission all work together in partnerships to protect the Valley's special identity and prepare for its future. The Blackstone River Greenway is a planned paved rail trail defining the course of the East Coast Greenway through the National Corridor. As of 2017, approximately of the greenway has been completed in Rhode Island and in Massachusetts. On October 12, 2006 the National Heritage Areas Act of 2006 was signed by the President, enacting it as Public Law Number 109-338. This legislation extends the Corridor Commission for five years until October 12, 2011.

The championship was established in July 1982, as the WWC World Heavyweight Championship, when the company was named Capitol Sports Promotions. The championship received its current name following a match between Carlos Col√≥n (WWC World Heavyweight Champion) and Ric Flair (NWA World Heavyweight Champion) where the \\"Champion of the Universe\\" was supposed to be determined. The first champion was Abdullah the Butcher, who was billed as champion upon the title's creation. Since being established, the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship has been held by forty-nine different wrestlers and has also been held up on nineteen occasions and vacated or stripped thirteen times. History Early history The WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship was first introduced as the WWC World Heavyweight Championship, when it was awarded to Abdullah the Butcher, after he won a \\"tournament\\" that supposedly took place in Japan. The tournament was part of a storyline and was used to relate to Abdullah's previous run in All Japan Pro Wrestling. Three days later Carlos Col√≥n became the first local wrestler to win the championship. During the championship's first years Col√≥n would defend the championship successfully against several international wrestlers, only losing it when a \\"feud angle\\" was being promoted. During December 1983, Capitol Sports Promotions gave a significant amount of promotion to an angle between Ric Flair and Carlos Col√≥n. At the moment when the feud happened Col√≥n was the WWC World Heavyweight Champion and Flair was the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. The angle included a spot where Flair would criticize Capitol's championship, claiming that he was the only \\"real world champion\\". This led to a match on December 18, 1983 where both wrestlers competed in an event organized at Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. The match was billed as a fight to determine the \\"undisputed champion of the Universe\\", and it took place inside a steel cage. Flair lost the match and Col√≥n was declared the \\"undisputed champion of the Universe\\", in the process the championship was renamed to WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship. February 17, 1985 marked the first time that the championship's holder changed outside of Puerto Rico, when Dory Funk, Jr. won it. After a rematch ended in a draw, the title was held up for the first time since its foundation. After Col√≥n defeated Flair, he would go on several undefeated streaks; this lasted until Funk \\"injured\\" him in a match. This event led to the championship being vacated for the first time. He subsequently competed in a tournament to determine the new champion where he won it for a fifth time. After this he was involved in an angle where Hercules Ayala turned on him and won the championship. This led to the organization of several matches, before he won it on a rematch. Sadistic Steve Strong was the next champion, upon his entrance to the company he was billed as a \\"satanic heel\\". Both wrestlers traded the title until it was held up and won by Col√≥n (in what marked his tenth title reign) who held it until December 17, 1989, when he lost it to Leo Burke. Following this Burke would go on to feud with Juan Rivera who at the time was referred to as \\"TNT\\". Both wrestlers had been involved in a mid-card feud prior to this. Rivera won the championship on February 9, 1990, eventually losing it to Abdullah the Butcher, who lost it to Col√≥n. The title was held up numerous times in 1991, as part of feuds between Col√≥n, Greg Valentine and Dino Bravo. Ray Gonz√°lez and Col√≥n family (1994‚Äì2005) On August 1, 1993, Col√≥n announced that he was retiring, vacating the championship in the process. Following this a tournament was scheduled to determine a new champion. On August 8, 1993, the final took place when Greg Valentine defeated Invader #1 to become the new champion, which led to a feud between both men. During this time Invader was part of the booking team and was interested in giving Ray Gonz√°lez a push as the company's top face. Then on April 24, 1994, Invader was supposed to challenge Valentine for the championship but was replaced by Gonz√°lez following an \\"injury\\". Gonz√°lez won the match and became the champion in an unexpected result. Gonz√°lez wasn't well received as a face and subsequently lost the championship to Dutch Mantel on June 22, 1994. This led to an angle between Mantel and Col√≥n, who won the championship a sixteenth time. He was subsequently involved in a feud with Mabel, in which both wrestlers had a reign, which Col√≥n eventually ended with Abdullah the Butcher winning the championship and engaging in a feud with Bronco, who won the championship on March 23, 1996. This led to a feud with Col√≥n, who defeated Bronco in a retirement vs. deportation match. After this Col√≥n retained the championship, with it being held up once during this period. On June 25, 1996, Jes√∫s Castillo, Jr. won the title while working a tour in Puerto Rico. Castillo dropped the title to Col√≥n on the last date of this tour. Col√≥n was then involved in angles with El Nene and Jim Steele with both of them winning the title once before dropping it back. Following this Col√≥n announced a semi-retirement and vacated the championship. A tournament was held with Gonz√°lez winning it again. During this run Ray was pushed and his adversaries tried to put him over. This was followed by an angle where Gonz√°lez and Col√≥n would experience trouble and after Gonz√°lez lost and regained the title against El Nene, both had a feud where Col√≥n won the championship for a twenty-third time, but ended up losing it back to Ray the following day. Gonz√°lez defended the title until November 26, 1998, when Glamour Boy Shane won it, losing it to Gonz√°lez two days after. Over the course of three months Ray lost and regained the title against Col√≥n again. This year the World Wrestling Council ran an invasion angle where personnel from Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) wrestled in the company; this led to a feud between Pierroth, Jr. and Gonz√°lez. Both of them faced each other in a hair vs. mask match for the championship, where Gonz√°lez won and Pierroth was forced to remove his mask. The following day Pierroth won the championship; this feud ended in a \\"loser leaves WWC\\" match that Gonz√°lez won and thus became champion for a ninth time. Soon after this Gonz√°lez was involved in an angle where Carly Col√≥n made his debut in wrestling, eventually helping Col√≥n win the championship for the last occasion in his career. Gonz√°lez would win the championship back on January 6, 2000. This was followed by an angle that saw Carly win the title. The feud continued with Gonz√°lez bringing foreign wrestlers to challenge him for the title, among whom were Curt Hennig and Jerry Flynn, who won the title eventually losing it to Bronco, who lost to Ray shortly after. Gonz√°lez was then involved in a feud where he retained against El Super Gladiador, during which the title was held up once. Carly won the championship back on the last show of 2001, which took place on December 1, 2001. This time he feuded with Vampiro who won the title once, with the title being subsequently held up and finally being won by Col√≥n again. After this he was involved with Konnan who won and dropped the championship in a day. By this time Gonz√°lez left WWC and Carly was matched against Chicky Starr who won the championship and had a short run until losing it back. Carly's final feud before signing with World Wrestling Entertainment was against Sabu with both men trading the championship once. When Carly left to Ohio Valley Wrestling a tournament was scheduled, where Lightning won the championship. He feuded with Thunder for some time and would go on to lose the championship to El Diamante on September 13, 2003. Diamante lost the championship, losing it to Carly who was on a temporal stay with the company and then losing it to Abdullah the Butcher on the final days of his stay. The wrestler didn't defend the title many times, however, and it was vacated. Bronco won a tournament organized for the championship and lost it to Eddie Col√≥n, leading to a feud between both. Eddie was pushed and defended against Jim Steele, Abyss and Abdullah the Butcher with the championship being held up only once. This led to a feud with El Diamante where both traded the championship before El Diamante left the company. During this time Bryan debuted with the company and won the championship shortly after, getting involved in a feud with Glamour Boy Shane, who won it on the company's Aniversario event on November 6, 2005. The IWA's unification of the \\"Capitol World Heavyweight Championship\\" Blitz holds the championships, with the \\"Capitol Heavyweight Championship\\" on the foreground On December 15, 2007, Scott Hall failed to attend a title defense which led to the fictional box and wrestling commission's decision to vacate the championship and award it to the number one contender, who at the moment was Miguel \\"Biggie Size\\" Maldonado. On December 29, 2007, the Universal championship was announced as \\"held-up\\" following the events where he was declared the champion following Hall's absence to Lockout. The commission's decision was announced during the company's holiday recess and Maldonado still retained physical possession of the championship belt. On January 6, 2008, Jack Mel√©ndez, who had been managing La Rabia, the stable where he performed, abandoned the company citing differences with the company's personnel. Following Mel√©ndez's exit from the company, La Rabia abandoned the company as well, no-showing the special event scheduled for January 6, 2008. That same night, Maldonado appeared at the International Wrestling Association's Histeria Boricua event, with the championship belt still in his possession and challenged Freddie \\"Blitz\\" Lozada, the current IWA World Heavyweight Champion to a unification match. The match took place later in the event with Lozada winning both belts. Following this match WWC's merchandise manager, Jos√© Roberto Rodr√≠guez, who had been allowed entry into the building, demanded that the belt was returned to him. However, by this time, the IWA's personnel had replaced the belt with Revolution X-Treme Wrestling's championship belt (which was in Savio Vega's possession) and had transferred the Universal Championship to a secure location. This led to a discussion between personnel from both companies and Rodr√≠guez's expulsion from the event. After the event's conclusion, police officers were contacted but the IWA retained physical possession of the championship. The belt was returned to WWC personnel following an ultimatum, which claimed that the company would take legal action if it wasn't returned within forty-eight hours. However, both the International Wrestling Association and the National Wrestling Alliance recognized the unification match, considering Lozada the first Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion in Puerto Rico. Tournament and redesign WWC organized a tournament to determine the next champion. Eliminatories for this event lasted for six months, using a points system to select the finalists. The final was scheduled for July 19, 2008, as part of Aniversario 2008, with Daniel Torres (otherwise known as Noriega) and Orlando Col√≥n advancing to it. A new belt (designed by Mike Nicolau) was introduced, while the former design was awarded to Carlos Col√≥n, who held a retirement ceremony earlier in the event. Torres won the tournament, defeating Col√≥n by pinfall. Second IWA exile and reunification After 36 days with the title, Torres left the company while still the champion and retaining physical possession of the belt, signing a contract with a promotion named Extreme Wrestling Organization, who was in association with a publicity company known as Wrestle Event, which facilitated the loan of large facilities. Shortly after, EWO's partnership with Wrestle Event dissolved and Torres joined the IWA, appearing in a backstage segment with the title, which was concealed in a black bag. During his next appearance, the distinctive strap of the belt was exposed outside the pouch, but the plaque remained hidden from view. Torres also addressed the crowd, stating that he was \\"collecting titles\\" and had arrived to the promotion because \\"the title in [his] possession was worthless because it was unified ten months [before]\\", prior to unsuccessfully challenging the IWA Undisputed Champion. This forced WWC to return to the former design, with Ray Gonz√°lez being the first to claim it in order to fill the vacancy. At Aniversario 2009, Torres returned to the company and removed the redesigned belt from the black bag that held it, being subsequently booked in an angle with the holder of the original belt, √Ångel \\"BJ\\" Rosado. A first unification match was held at Summer Madness, with both titles being held up following a controversial finish. On September 26, 2009, Torres was booked to defeat Rosado, winning both belts and unifying the title, holding it for a day before dropping them to Shane Sewell. On November 1, 2009, Sewell and the incumbent IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion, Joe Bravo, performed in a Dominican Wrestling Entertainment event, with Bravo's DWE Dominican National Championship being held up after the creative team booked a no contest. This marked the first instance that the two major champions worked together while holding full recognition by both promotions. Talent exchange and other alliances Throughout 2012 the title made appearances in Brooklyn-based Fighting Spirit Wrestling (FSW), represented by Gilbert Cruz (who also held the FSW World Heavyweight Championship during this timeframe and carried both belts) and by Germ√°n Figueroa (as Apollo), also being featured in a champion vs. champion match between both. The title has also been acknowledged in another New York metropolitan area promotion, Amaro Productions, being referred to as the \\"WWC Campeon de Universal\\" while promoting a tour featuring former champion Figueroa in 2013. In 2014, during its brief alliance with the World Wrestling League (WWL), WWC allowed some of its talent to participate in cards held abroad by that promotion, while the Universal Championship would be promoted by the former in its media presentations of Shane Sewell and Jos√© Torres. International exposition and defenses (2015‚Äìpresent) On April 4, 2015, John Yurnet (otherwise known as Mr. 450 or Jes√∫s de Le√≥n) made an appearance in WWC and issued a challenge for the Universal Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Camino a la Gloria. However, the match ended without a clear winner and Carlos \\"Chicano\\" Cotto retained. The series between both peaked in a cage match, which Yurnet won to become the 50th Universal Heavyweight Champion. At Aniversario 2015, he defeated Carly Col√≥n to retain. During his reign as champion, Yurnet would wear the belt in his appearances outside of Puerto Rico, carrying it with him in matches throughout the independent circuit of the United States and Canada. In an interview with WrestleZone, he explained that his intention was to give the title the foreign exposition that it had when Carlos Col√≥n and Dory Funk feuded over it in the NWA territories and that he wanted people to feel \\"[that] this guy is going over to Japan with the belt and representing the island there. [...] This guy is going to Ecuador and he's representing there.\\" On October 16, 2015, he debuted in Caution Wrestling Federation (CWF) by successfully defending the Universal Heavyweight Championship against masked luchador Zoom Driver, marking the first time that the title had been on the line in Mexican territory. After this reign was concluded, his successor Carly Col√≥n (now performing as Carlito Caribbean Cool) and the title were featured prominently in promotions for Wrestling Superstars' MysterioMania tour in Chile. Another aspect of this initiative included contracting foreign figures to challenge for the title in WWC, highlighted by a defense against Rey Mysterio. Belt designs The classic design of the belt referenced its origin as a NWA title by adopting the overall design of the NWA Mid-Atlantic United States Heavyweight Championship, albeit with several modifications. The central design that prominently features an eagle was left intact, however, the belt replaced all references to the latter's regional nature by removing all depictions relating to the United States in general. Among the most prominent changes was the replacement of the flag of the United States present on top of the eagle in the NWA Mid-Atlantic title with a representation of two wrestlers locked in a grappling hold, and the replacement of a political map of the United States that was found in an oval located under the eagle's feet with a globe. Another attempt to distance it from its regional inspiration was the removal of an \\"NWA\\" inscription on the top of the place, with the Universal Championship featuring a mantling design instead. Ray Gonz√°lez with the classic title belt. The NWA Mid-Atlantic title's prominent \\"United States\\" inscription was replaced with the word \\"Universal\\", written in a slightly different font from its inspiration. Besides these changes, the plaque's design remains consistent with its source, with the only remaining difference being the placement of a set of screws. The main side plates remained round and proportional to its inspiration but were entirely redesigned, with the United States shield being abandoned for a depiction of two wrestlers in mid- hold decorated with mantling. The smaller side plates featured depictions of a royal crown with similar mantling, instead of the scene of two wrestlers struggling before a United States shield and the NWA logo. The belt itself was black, similar to the NWA Mid-Atlantic United States Heavyweight Championship. The plaque and design was used constantly for nearly three decades, with the only notable changes being that the banners and other decorations were changed from its original black coloration to red and that the globe design that was originally golden was painted blue where the water bodies should be. WWC commissioned a new belt design to Top Rope Belts in 2008, with the company creating a new template and design to create \\"something special\\". The new plaques were created to preserve a \\"classic feel to [them]\\" as noted by the manufacturer, which can be discerned with the re-design and relocation of several elements of the classic plaques, such as the eagle (now two smaller eagles flanking a much larger globe), the scene of wrestlers in a hold (now the central element and \\"stacked\\" over the globe), its coloration (the new scheme is black, red and blue, unifying both of the classic combinations) and the stars that were originally present in the main banner (which were now distributed throughout the main plaque). The side main side plaques present a modern depiction of the classic's wrestling match. WWC's current logo, adopted in the early 2000s, is now featured prominent on top of the main plaque and in the smaller side plaques. The belt was officially introduced in July 2008, with the first holder being determined in that year's Aniversario event.  Reigns  WWC currently recognizes 150 individual Universal Heavyweight Championship reigns. Carlos Col√≥n, Sr. holds the record with twenty-six championships and also holds the record for most cumulative days as champion, totaling 3,945 days. His second reign is the longest in the history of the title, as he held the title for 655 days. Three wrestlers are tied for the shortest reign in history, with all three lasting less than one day, these are Carly Col√≥n's 11th reign and Vampiro and Lance Hoyt's lone reigns. Unofficially, BJ is recognized as the youngest wrestler to win the championship at 20 years and 357 days. However, for storyline purposes, Ray Gonz√°lez's reign at 21 years and 355 days is credited with this feat.

He was born in Waltrop, Germany, to Dr. Josef Hues and Maria Humperdinck Hues who still resides in Germany. Maria is the niece of Engelbert Humperdinck, composer of the opera Hansel and Gretel. After graduating from school, Hues moved to Paris to enter hotel management. Once there he joined a health club in Paris, which had just been bombarded with the new Jane Fonda aerobic exercise program from the United States. Hues recognized an opportunity and after returning to Germany opened two health clubs, flying in aerobic teachers from the USA. During this time he became obsessed with the American way of life, and subsequently sold his clubs - boarding a plane to Los Angeles. He immediately joined Gold's Gym in Venice, California, the mecca of bodybuilding and entertainment personalities. Derek Barton, a former Hollywood stuntman and formerly one of Gold's managing directors, received a call from a producer who had just lost Jean-Claude Van Damme for his movie and needed a replacement. Barton sent Hues to test for the role, and he managed to convince the producers to give him the part despite having no prior acting experience. The movie, No Retreat, No Surrender 2 (1987), was a moderate success, and opened the door for Hues to make more films. His most commercially successful movie to date is Dark Angel (1990) and he has played a variety of roles in his films, from a gladiator turned private investigator in Age of Treason (1993) to an aging hit-man in Finding Interest (1994) to a bumbling idiot trying to kidnap a rich kid in Alone in the Woods (1996) to a dancing lion tamer in Big Top Pee-wee (1988). He also played a Klingon general in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991). Hues is one of the few foreign actors who has lost his accent to the extent that many people in his own country are unaware he is from Germany.

At in length, it is one of the shortest signed state highways in all of New York. The route begins at NY 38A a half-mile (0.8 km) north of the Onondaga-Cayuga County county line and ends at NY 41A in the hamlet of Mandana. It lies between Skaneateles Lake and Owasco Lake. Excluding its termini, there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route. NY 359 was assigned in the early 1940s and was part of the original NY 26 from 1924 to 1930. Route description The southern terminus of NY 359 at NY 38A NY 359 begins in the town of Skaneateles at an intersection with Heifer Street, a local road, and NY 38A. The route goes north, intersecting with Weeks Road north of NY 38A. Here, NY 359 begins to curve to the east with Weeks Road carrying on the northward alignment of NY 359\\\\. Upon meeting Lacy Road, the route takes over its east-west routing and heads east. NY 359 comes to an end just under a mile later at NY 41A in the lakeside hamlet of Mandana. East of NY 41A, the roadway continues for roughly to a boat launch on the western shore of Skaneateles Lake, from NY 38A. Signed as a north-south route, it lies that way at the southern end, but about midway along its length the road turns and thence travels east-west. Excluding its termini, there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route. It is the only instance in New York of a route designated without an alphabetic suffix that terminates at both ends at suffixed routes. History The origins of NY 359 date back to the assignment of the first state routes in New York in 1924. At this time, all of modern NY 359 became part of NY 26, a highway that continued north along what is now NY 41A toward the village of Skaneateles and south on modern NY 38A toward the village of Moravia. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 26 was reassigned elsewhere in the state. Its former routing was incorporated into several new routes, including part of NY 38A from Moravia to the modern junction of NY 38A and NY 359 and part of NY 41A from Mandana to Skaneateles. The portion that is now NY 359, however, received no designation and became unnumbered.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

Background The lyrics of the song state that Liesl is a young girl at the beginning of her womanhood, and that she can depend on Rolf for guidance, because he is a good year older. Since the comparative maturity of the two characters in the story is the opposite of that expressed in the song, this is an example of lyrical irony. A reprise of \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" is also sung by Maria and Liesl when the Captain and Maria came back from their honeymoon and Rolf has rejected Liesl. The introduction for the reprise, written to be sung by Maria, was not included in the film version of The Sound of Music, but continue to be used in theatrical versions of the musical. \\"A bell is no bell till you ring it, A song is no song till you sing it, And love in your heart Wasn‚Äôt put there to stay - Love isn‚Äôt love Till you give it away.\\" Songwriters Don Roth and Timmy Tappan borrowed heavily from Hammerstein's introduction to the reprise in \\"Love Isn't Love ('Til You Give It Away)\\", which was a song covered by Reba McEntire on her Behind the Scene album: \\"A smile's not a smile until it wrinkles your face A bell's not a bell without ringing A home's not a home when there's nobody there A song's not a song without singing. \\"Love isn't love till you give it away Love isn't love till it's free The love in your heart Wasn't put there to stay Oh love isn't love till you give it away.\\" In the motion picture version, the song was filmed in and around a gazebo which is still visited by hundreds of tourists each day doing \\"Sound of Music\\" tours around Salzburg though the gazebo interiors were filmed in Hollywood. Charmian Carr was actually 21 years old when the song was filmed.https://moviepilot.com/p/forever-16-going- on-17-a-look-back-at-charmian-carrs-career/4101010 State Farm Remix State Farm Insurance released an ad campaign featuring a remix of the show tune as a rock song. It was produced by the audio production firm Modern Music. In popular culture This song was used twice on Family Guy. The song is heard in the episode \\"Family Gay\\" and Lois sings the song to her daughter Meg in the episode \\"Peter's Two Dads,\\" trying to guess how old she is. The song was reimagined by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in an episode of their sketch show French and Saunders where, as one of several sketches based on the movie, the two sit in the gazebo singing the lyrics \\"I am French/And you are Saunders\\". The song was used as the outro music for \\"Tea Leaves,\\" a fifth- season episode of the US television series Mad Men.http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682246/mad-men-betty.jhtml The song was used in the 1996 British film Beautiful Thing. On the second night they share a bed, Jamie kisses Ste for the first time, and the song is heard playing at the end of the scene. The song continues playing through to the following scenes. On May 4, 2000, Julia Louis-Dreyfus was a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, ending her visit on the show by performing a rendition of the song with fellow Seinfeld co-star, Jerry Seinfeld himself. A movie in 2004, 13 Going on 30, is named after this, and also includes a parody. Seohyun of Korean pop group Girls' Generation did a cover of it for their \\"Into the New World tour\\". It was later put on the tour album. It is a part of the play in The Pacifier (starring Vin Diesel). The song is used by WGR 550 in Buffalo leading into discussions about the Bills playoff drought. The \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" scene is featured on The Orville episode \\"If the Stars Should Appear\\" when Klyden asks to see something to make him happy in addition to eating rocky road ice cream as \\"depression food\\" following an argument with Bortus.

The Mall is owned by The Forbes Company which also owns The Gardens Mall and the larger Somerset Collection, in Troy, Michigan. The Somerset Collection was used as a model for the Mall at Millenia. Like Somerset, the Mall at Millenia was designed by JPRA Architects and features award-winning lighting by Paul Gregory (Focus Lighting), glass elevators, and fountains. Neither mall has kiosks. When the mall first opened, there was not much else in the surrounding area. That has changed in the last five years and the area in which the mall is located in now locally known as \\"Millenia.\\" The area, particularly the Mall, has become a major draw for business and tourists alike.

He is known for leaking information regarding the Chinese film industry's yin-yang contracts leading to Fan Bingbing's removal from the spotlight, his affable and natural sense of humour, pioneering a brand of relaxed and unscripted presentation style that marked a departure from the rigid and staid nature of many Chinese talk shows. Cui rose to fame hosting the show Tell It Like It Is on China Central Television from 1996 to 2002. After a battle with depression, Cui returned to CCTV to host Talk with Xiaocui. From 2012 to 2013 Cui hosted the show Thank the Heavens and the Earth that you are here. He left CCTV in 2013 to work at his alma mater, the Communication University of China. Biography Cui was born on February 20, 1963 in the Beichen District of Tianjin. His father was in the military. The family moved to Beijing when Cui was three years old, and he attended primary and high school in Beijing. Cui graduated from the Communication University of China in 1985, then began working for China Central Television as a reporter shortly thereafter. Starting in 1993, Cui became involved in the planning for the Oriental Horizon (‰∏úÊñπÊó∂Á©∫) program. The show Tell It Like It Is (ÂÆûËØùÂÆûËØ¥) began in 1996, and was conceptualized as a Sunday supplement to Oriental Horizon, with Cui as host. The first show aired on April 26, 1996. Soon after Tell it like it is gained a following in its own right, in large part due to Cui's personality. Cui's brand of television spurred a host of copycat shows in other networks attempting to emulate Cui's natural and humorous presentation style in a Chinese TV world that is full of staid and scripted presentation. With the success of Tell it like it is, Cui became a national celebrity. He was invited to host the 2000 edition of the CCTV New Year's Gala. Beginning in 2001 Cui was diagnosed with clinical depression. He reported severe trouble falling asleep. He left Tell it like it is abruptly in 2002. After a battle with depression, Cui returned to CCTV to host Talk with Xiao Cui (Â∞èÂ¥îËØ¥‰∫ã). Cui was named as one of the Top Ten Best Hosts of CCTV for 2005.CCTV Names Its Ten Best Hosts for 2005, China Radio International, 2006-10-16. In addition, during the 2007 National People's Congress he hosted a talk show where he met with regional Chinese leaders to discuss everyday issues of concern to the people, the first of its kind in the PRC. Cui has made several appearances at the CCTV New Year's Gala. He appeared twice in skits featuring Zhao Benshan and Song Dandan entitled Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow in 1999 and again in 2006. He also danced and sang with Taiwan actress and My Fair Princess star Ruby Lin in 2000. In November 2013, Cui Yongyuan embarked upon a two-week journey to the United States to film a documentary on genetically modified foods. In the documentary Cui aimed to explore the debate on whether genetically modified food is safe to eat. The documentary was widely viewed in China and was criticized by anti- pseudoscience crusader Fang Zhouzi as being unscientific and misleading. Cui and Fang then exchanged a series of increasingly personal comments on a public micro-blogging platform, attacking each other. After the heated and widely publicized exchange, Fang sued Cui in a Beijing court demanding compensation of 670,000 yuan, alleging defamation. Chinese-language media has cited fallout from the conflict as a reason Cui has decided to leave television for a position to teach at the Communications University of China, his alma mater. In January 2015, Cui signed on with Shanghai-based Dragon Television to host the program \\"Eyes on Dongfang\\" (‰∏úÊñπÁúº). At the 2015 National People's Congress, Cui bantered with Central Commission for Discipline Inspection chief Wang Qishan, remarking \\"I don't think I did anything wrong, but I'm still pretty nervous when I see you,\\" ostensibly a reference to Wang's work in the anti- corruption campaign. Cui also shot a mobile phone video with Wang. In June 2018, he leaked two contradicting film contracts for Fan Bingbing's Feng Xiaogang film Cell Phone 2, accusing her of using what are considered yin-yang contracts to conduct tax evasion. Cui later apologized after allegations surfaced indicating Fan may have been removed from the spotlight by the Chinese government.https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/14/asia/fan-bingbing-china- celebrity-intl/index.html Controversies Anti-GMO campaign In September 2013, Cui Yongyuan and Fang Zhouzi had an online debate on the commercialization of GMO foods. After that, Cui went to Japan and the US and conducted a private investigation on the consumption and regulations of GMO in those two countries. In 2014, Cui claimed that Fang operated an illegal trust fund and bought a luxurious house in California worth $670,000 USD with money earned through deceitful and shady practices. Fang therefore sued him for slandering.Âåó‰∫¨Ê≥ïÈô¢ÂèóÁêÜÊñπËàüÂ≠êËØâÂ¥îÊ∞∏ÂÖÉ‰æµÁäØÂêçË™âÊùÉÊ°àÔºå‰∫öÂ§™Êó•Êä•Ôºå2014Âπ¥1Êúà23Êó• The verdict was released on June 25, 2015, deciding that both parties are at fault and each should release apologies publicly to the other. Fang decided to appeal. On March 26, 2015, Cui gave a talk at Fudan University on the topic of GMO. The organizers tried to discourage students and faculty members from the Life Science Department from attending by not sending a public invitation, but Professor Lu Daru of the Genetics Institute got the news and challenged him on site during the Q and A session. Cui claimed that Lu \\"have not the knowledge of broadcasting, and therefore does not qualify to debate him on the same level,\\" and also declared that \\"us 'consensus front of journalists' thinks that your ('consensus front of scientific researchers', a phrase used by Lu earlier) claims (on GMO) is not well founded.\\" In July 2015, a Weibo microblogger (a platform similar to Twitter in China) posted a parody fake-news stating that ‚ÄúFrench fries from both KFC and McDonald's are found to contain a potentially poisonous chemical called sodium chloride‚Äù. Not knowing that sodium chloride is common salt, Cui fell for it and reblogged this as news and even featured this repost on his Weibo account with a sarcastic comment ‚ÄúThis is not scientific, because medical research has not found even one case of people getting sick due to eating French fries from KFC or McDonald's. This is exactly the same as GMO!‚Äù He was soon ridiculed for his lack of common knowledge of chemistry due to this, and many questioned his basic skills in natural sciences. Reporting of data security issues of China Record Corporation's business practice On June 8, 2015, Cui posted on his Weibo that China Record Corporation has subcontracted the digitization of some historical documents to a Japanese company, which including the release of master copies to the contractor. Cui claims that such act is in violation of regulations on data security and needs to be reported. China Record Corporation replied by saying that the digitization work is done by a subsidiary company named Victory Records and Videos and all that are involved in the process are strictly Chinese citizens.

She is now Australia's oldest continuously- licensed passenger vessel, although there are several older vessels still in service that have been restored after lengthy periods in dereliction. The Cartela is a motor vessel of gross, net register, and is in overall length ( keel). History The Cartela (the Tasmanian Aboriginal name for a bull seal) was built in 1912 at Battery Point, Hobart, by Purdon & Featherstone for the Huon Channel and Peninsula Steamship Company Pty. Ltd. She was designed to operate as a cargo and passenger vessel in the coastal and riverine trades south and south-east of the city. The Cartela was primarily constructed to replace an earlier vessel, the Awittaka, that had recently been sold to the Solomon Islands Government, and she was specially designed to be the fastest vessel in the premier excursion trade. That was achieved by fitting the vessel with a powerful triple-expansion steam engine (), and a large-capacity boiler that allowed lengthy periods of operation at maximum speed without losing pressure - a problem faced by both her predecessor and her chief rival the SS Togo. Cartela and Togo regularly competed in an unofficial race held on Christmas Day until 1931, and both won five races each. In 1926, the two vessels collided off Battery Point and the Togo was forced aground. Because the vessels had passed out of state-controlled harbour waters into federally- controlled coastal waters during the course of the race, a Royal Commission was held into whether the Marine Board of Hobart was entitled to hold an inquiry. At the outbreak of World War I, Cartela was leased by the Royal Australian Navy for use as an examination vessel.J.H. Straczek, \\"The Royal Australian Navy\\" protecting the port of Hobart. Most of Cartelas service until after World War II involved operating passenger and cargo services between Hobart, the Tasman Peninsula, and ports on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel, with a proportion of excursion activities up and down the River Derwent. She occasionally performed other duties, including a voyage to Melbourne during a seamen's strike in 1919, and acting as a tug, before dedicated tug-boats were employed in Hobart after World War II. One significant tow was the rescue of the dismasted barque Inverness-shire, a vessel more than ten times her size, from Storm Bay to Hobart in 1915. A legal case arising from that event is still occasionally cited as a reference regarding the legal distinction between \\"towage\\" and \\"salvage\\". Improved road services connecting outlying regions of south-eastern Tasmania brought an end to commercial river steamer services, so by the 1950s, the vessel was almost exclusively engaged in excursion work around Hobart for new owners Roche Brothers Pty. Ltd. In 1958, Cartela was extensively altered, being converted from a steamship to a motor vessel. In 1975, following the Tasman Bridge disaster, she was fitted with more powerful engines for use as a ferry. Cartela is now owned by the SteamShip Cartela Trust on behalf of the Tasmanian people. In recognition of her being one of the very few timber vessels that has remained in continuous commercial service for a century, in 2016 it was announced that she would undergo a complete renovation and be returned to steam power. That would including the refurbishment of the original Plenty & Sons steam engine. Engines First Engine Cartela's first engine was a reciprocating triple-expansion steam engine built by Plenty and Sons, Newbury, England. It had three cylinders, powering a four-bladed propeller in diameter. . The engine was used from 1912 to 1958. Coal bunker capacity was . Second Engine Cartela's second engine was a Vivian 8-cylinder diesel engine (@ 600RPM), powering a single propeller by . The engine was used until 1975. Third Engine Cartela's third engine was installed to give her the speed provided by her original steam engine. It was a 6-cylinder turbocharged Caterpillar diesel engine, producing (@ 1800RPM). Fuel tank capacity was 1800 litres.

The most serious occurred at Picatinny Arsenal Ammunition Storage Depot, New Jersey, in July, 1926 when an electrical storm led to fires that caused explosions and widespread destruction. The severe property damage and 19 fatalities led Congress to empower a board of Army and Naval officers to investigate the Picatinny Arsenal disaster and determine if similar conditions existed at other ammunition depots. The board reported in its findings that this mishap could recur, prompting Congress to establish a permanent board of colonels to develop explosives safety standards and ensure compliance beginning in 1928. This organization evolved into the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and is chartered in Title 10 of the US Code. The DDESB authors Defense Explosives Safety Regulation (DESR) 6055.9Defense Explosives Safety Regulation 6055.09 which establishes the explosives safety standards for the Department of Defense. The DDESB also evaluates scientific data which may adjust those standards, reviews and approves all explosives site plans for new construction, and conducts worldwide visits to locations containing US title munitions. The cardinal principle of explosives safety is expose the minimum number of people for the minimum time to the minimum amount of explosives. US Air Force The United States Air Force counterpart to the DDESB is the Air Force Safety Center (AFSEC/SEW). Similar safety functions are found at major command headquarters, intermediate command headquarters, and installation weapons safety offices, culminating with unit-level explosives safety programs. The current Air Force regulation governing explosives safety is Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201AIR FORCE MANUAL 91-201. AFMAN 91-201 was developed using DESR 6055.09 as a parent regulation, and in most cases follows the limitations set forth in the DESR (excluding mission-specific requirements). The Air Force deviates from DESR 6055.9 as long as the risks of doing so are assessed and accepted at the appropriate level. US Army The United States Army counterpart to the DDESB is the U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (USATCES). The USATCES is located with the Defense Ammunition Center on McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, near McAlester, Oklahoma . USATCES is responsible for providing ammunition and explosives (A&E;) safety worldwide by acting as the field office of the Department of Army Safety responsible for A&E; safety. The USATCES also acts as the Army agency having safety oversight of clean-up of Former Used Defense Sites (FUDS)1 azdeq.gov retrieved 2011-11-232 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). retrieved 2011-11-23 and Former Toxic Chemical Agent Sites where munitions from all branches of service disposed of A&E; by burial or dumping up until the end of the Vietnam War. The USATCES acts as the Army's safety watchdog for disposal of chemical ammunition at the Army's Chemical Disposal Facilities. As part of Army's Ordnance Corps under TRADOC Specially trained Civilian Explosives Safety Personnel [Quality Assurance Specialist (Ammunition Surveillance) (QASAS)apd.army.mil retrieved 2011-11-23] and Safety Specialist that have received specialized training in A&E; Safety) from the USATCES are deployed worldwide, wherever the U.S. Army has A&E.; Their mission is to provide A&E; safety to the soldier, the public, and the environment making sure the Army's A&E; is not only stored safely but ready, reliable, and lethal when the U.S. military needs it. Net Explosives Weight (NEW) The net explosives weight (NEW) is the total weight of all explosives substances in a single item. NEW is used to calculate safe separation distances (see Quantity-Distance). NEW for a specific explosive may be adjusted by its TNT equivalence which is the weight of trinitrotoluene (TNT) required to produce a shockwave of equal magnitude as that produced by one pound of the explosive in question. For example, C-4 has a TNT equivalency for overpressure of 1.34 (one pound of C-4 is equal to 1.34 pounds of TNT). Quantity-Distance (QD) Quantity-Distance (QD) is the foundation of DOD explosives safety standards. It defines levels of protection from blast based on relationships between the quantity of explosive material (NEW) and distance. The relationships are based on levels of risk considered acceptable for specific exposures but they do not provide absolute safety or protection. Exposures are expressed by a ‚ÄúK-factor‚Äù (K6, K18, etc.) which represents the degree of protection provided; higher is better. K328 equates to a blast overpressure of 0.0655 psi which will not harm people in the open. Blast Wave Phenomena A Blast Wave Phenomenon is an incident involving the violent release of energy created by detonation of an explosive device. The sudden and intense pressure disturbance is termed the ‚Äúblast wave.‚Äù The blast wave is characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure increase or ‚Äúshock front,‚Äù travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a diminishing velocity that is always in excess of the speed of sound in that medium. Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the ‚Äúparticle velocity,‚Äù is associated with the ‚Äúdynamic pressure,‚Äù or the pressure formed by the winds produced by the shock front. As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increase. If the shock wave strikes a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction of the wave's propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This reflected pressure is a function of the incident wave's pressure and the angle formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front. Fragments An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated with an explosion is the effect of any fragments produced. Although fragmentation most commonly occurs in high explosives events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving ammunition and explosives (A&E;). Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as ‚Äúprimary‚Äù or ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù fragments. Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles, hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives and rocket engine housings) in direct contact with the explosive. These fragments usually are small, initially travel at thousands of feet per second, and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion. Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to the explosion. These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary fragments. Thermal Hazards Generally, thermal hazards from explosives events are of less concern than blast and fragment hazards. With the release of energy from an explosion is heat. The amount of heat varies with the energetic compound (explosive). All explosives compound molecules are potentially unstable held together with weak bonds in their outer shell. When this weak bond is broken heat and energy is violently released. It normally takes longer for the thermal blast to incur. Injury from thermal effects follows the blast and fragmentation effects which happen almost instantaneously. This does not imply that there is a time lapse between blast and fragmentation effects of explosives; in fact it happens so fast that humans cannot notice the delay without specialized equipment. The time available to react to a thermal event does increases survivability by rapid equipment designed to react in a fragment of a second. The primary effect of the thermal effect from an explosive detonation on structures, material, and ammunition and explosives (A&E;) is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern for explosives safety with a fire involving A&E; is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, causing detonations of additional or more hazardous explosives devises and placing more people or property at a greater degree of risk of damage, destruction, injury, or death. Susan Test Following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash and the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash, accident investigators concluded that the conventional explosives used at the time in nuclear weapons were not stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. The finding triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives that could be used in nuclear weapons. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed the \\"Susan Test\\" ‚Äî a standard test that uses a special projectile whose design simulates an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between metal surfaces. The test projectile is fired under controlled conditions at a hard surface to measure the reactions and thresholds of different explosives to an impact. Explosives Safety Specialist This is a highly trained and skilled civilian professional usually a QASAS or a Safety Specialist that has been trained to evaluate risk and hazards involved with conventional, guided missiles and toxic chemical ammunition operations. Department of Defense Standards requires that only trained and certified personnel are permitted to participate in operations involving ammunition, explosives, and/or explosive components, guided missiles, and toxic chemicals. They are responsible for providing protection from the effects of ammunition and explosives by evaluation of a set of standards developed by the Department of Defense and reinforced by additional regulations by the branch of military service responsible for the explosives item. They develop safety programs to minimize losses due to injuries and property damage. They try to eliminate unsafe practices and conditions on sites where ammunition and explosives (A&E;) are used or stored. Military explosives safety specialist are deployed along with U.S. Military forces to maintain safe storage and use of A&E.; They are responsible to recommend to military command ways to store A&E; that reduce the risk of injury or death to service men and women in case of an accidental detonation or if the A&E; supply is hit by enemy attack. Much of the work of military explosives safety specialist is identical to their civilian counterparts. They have offices where they analyze data and write reports to upper commands on the storage of A&E.; Much of their time is spent reviewing or preparing explosives safety site plans. An explosives site plan (ESS) is the composite risk management (CRM) process associated with explosives/toxic chemical activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel, equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. The damage or injury potential of explosions is determined by the separation distance between potential explosion sites (PES) and exposed sites (ES); the ability of the PES to suppress blast overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion effects. Planning for the proper location and construction of A&E; facilities and surrounding facilities exposed to A&E; facilities is a key element of the explosives/toxic chemical site planning process. This management process also ensures that risks above those normally accepted for A&E; activities are identified and approved at the proper level of command. Explosives Safety Specialist must often travel to different storage sites to verify that the military installation is meeting the service explosives safety regulations. Explosives Safety Specialist often works with other safety professionals. They are required to know OSHA, EPA, NFPA and other consensus standards when looking at safety and if these regulations are stricter than their service regulation they must apply these standards and regulations. They must also know Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulations dealing with A&E; and apply those standards if it is required. They must be able to convince people the need for following prescribes explosives safety standards/regulations. They must also work with ammunition cleanup sites insuring that safety laws and regulations as well as industry standards are followed. They should be good at solving problems. The military is not the only industry to use explosives safety specialist but are by far the largest employer. Mining and construction also use explosives safety specialist to evaluate hazard and risk from explosives and blasting operations. Ammunition and explosives manufactures also use these professionals. Outside the military explosives safety specialist must apply and be knowledgeable of ATF, OSHA, EPA, NFPA, as well as state and local regulations dealing with safety of A&E.; See also *Explosion protection *Explosion vent *Explosive material *Explosives shipping classification system  References  * External links * Explosives Safety Support * ddesb.pentagon * retrieved 2011-11-23 nasa.gov Category:Explosives Category:Explosion protection Safety ","title":"Explosives safety"},{"id":"4518558","text":"Supercar Street Challenge is a racing video game developed by Exakt Entertainment and published by Activision for PlayStation 2 and Windows in 2001.

Molloy is known for his role in the cultivation of Jim Brown's legendary athletic talent. When the coaching staffs at Syracuse University did not offer a scholarship to Brown, Molloy amassed enough money to pay for Brown's first year and obtained a promise from the school that if Brown was as talented as said to be, he would be put on scholarship. Molloy was born in Brooklyn, New York and attended high school at Manual Training High School where he played lacrosse, basketball, baseball and swimming. He also worked on the school newspaper, was class president and a member of the student government. Molloy was also a member of the Mu Chapter of the Omega Gamma Delta fraternity and became acquainted with Manhasset through both the fraternity (which had a chapter in Manhasset) and through lacrosse which was then the only school on Long Island to have a team. From Brooklyn he went upstate to Syracuse University, where he played lacrosse and was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. He became a two-time All-American in lacrosse. Following his time in the Navy, he returned to Syracuse for law school and doubled as the Syracuse Varsity Lacrosse coach. Molloy passed the New York Bar Exam while still a law student and the Bar Association responded by precluding students from taking the exam in future. He came to Manhasset after law school and became deeply involved in the local lacrosse program and expanding the lacrosse programs at Long Island schools. Over his nearly 50 years in Manhasset, his community involvement led to his being dubbed \\"Mr. Manhasset.\\" During the 1960s he was an unsuccessful Republican nominee for Congress. The lacrosse field in Manhasset and an annual Lacrosse Invitational are named in his honor. He died in March 1999. A formal memorial service at the Supreme Court Building in Mineola attracted participation by a record number of current and former justices. His son, Kenneth Molloy, and grandson, Kenneth Thomas Molloy, are named after him. World War II On March 29, 1943, Ens. Molloy was assigned to Squadron 21 and told to report to Commander Motor Torpedo Squadron Twenty-One, Navy Yard, New York for outfitting. He then served as a PT boat commander in the Pacific in World War II where he was awarded a Silver Star. At the time of the award he was a Lieutenant (jg.) Following his tour as a PT boat commander, Molloy was recruited by the O.S.S. to head a close to suicide mission in connection with the projected invasion of Japan. There are large tunnels connecting the Japanese southern islands with the main island and a small fleet of junks was to be filled with high explosives and sunk over the tunnels to destroy them prior to the actual invasion, making the movement of troops difficult. A single junk was designated to attempt rescue of the crews. Ken and his associates were on their way back to the Pacific from training in the United States when the atom bombs were dropped, obviating the need for more desperate measures. Molloy had sufficiently impressed the head of the O.S.S., General William Donovan, that he later offered Molloy a place in his law firm on graduation from law school. Awards Kenneth Molloy was awarded the Silver Star Medal for his service in World War II. His citation reads as follows: > AWARD OF SILVER STAR MEDAL By virtue of the power delegated to me, I take > pleasure in awarding in the name of the President of the United States, the > Silver Star Medal to: LIEUTENANT (JG) KENNETH D.

He and his partner Mattie Purnell invented the Harlem Lindy Hop in the dance marathon at Harlem‚Äôs Rockland Palace between June and July 1928. Snowden and Purnell‚Äôs invention was based on the breakaway pattern which they practically rediscovered via an accident in the dance marathon.George Snowden‚Äôs career in dancing is discussed, in particular, Terry Monaghan‚Äôs George Snowden article, and Harri Heinil√§‚Äôs doctoral dissertation.

Heinil√§ published also an article of George Snowden and Mattie Purnell where they are discussed concerning their invention. The article can be found at https://authenticjazzdance.wordpress.com/2012/07/04/the-creators- of-the-lindy-hop-george-shorty-snowden-and-mattie-purnell/ . There existed various Lindy Hop dances around the U.S. since Charles Lindbergh's flight over the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, which were not connected to the Harlem dance. The Harlem Lindy Hop was not the first of the Lindy Hop dances, but it was probably the only one which survived in the long run.Peter BetBasoo has discussed the Lindy Hop dances which existed before the Harlem Lindy Hop. See: Peter BetBasoo, Lindy Hop and Argentine Tango, copyright Peter BetBasoo, published in the Internet, 2009. Snowden is sometimes inaccurately credited with coining the name 'Lindy Hop' for a popular partner jazz dance of the day. As there is evidence for his role in creating the Lindy Hop, there is no proper evidence for the naming of the dance. The term ‚ÄòLindy Hop‚Äô in connection with Snowden and Purnell‚Äôs invention was used for the first time in public in September 1928 when Snowden was advertised to perform in the Lincoln Theatre in Harlem. Whether it was Snowden or someone else who named the Lindy Hop for the newspaper advertisement is unclear.See: Monaghan 2004 and Heinil√§ 2016, pages 138-141. After the dance marathon, Snowden became a popular dancer at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, New York, and around the United States when he with his dance group were the first Savoy Lindy Hoppers who took the Lindy Hop to competitions, ballrooms, night clubs, and Broadway plays like Blackbirds (1930) and Singing the Blues (1931) after his groundbreaking invention, and appears in the film After Seben (1929). He can also be seen in the film Ask Uncle Sol (1937), dancing with his most famous partner Big Bea.See: Monaghan 2004 and Heinil√§ 2016, pages 148, 165-168. The Shorty George in the Lindy Hop repertoire is named for Snowden.See: Monaghan 2004. A man of diminutive height, he used his size for comic effect. With his partner Big Bea, Snowden would often out-dance other couples in dance competitions of the day, and was a member of a number of significant dance troupes, including the Shorty Snowden Dancers, which has been credited as the first Lindy Hop dance troupe. Rita Hayworth and Fred Astaire paid tribute to Snowden in their \\"Shorty George\\" number (music by Jerome Kern, lyrics by Johnny Mercer) in the 1942 film You Were Never Lovelier.

The gallery exhibits some of the most influential artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are 16 gallery spaces: five in New York; three in London; two in Paris; one each in Basel, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Rome, Athens, Geneva and Hong Kong. Development 1980s Larry Gagosian opened his first gallery in Los Angeles in 1980. In the 1980s, the Los Angeles gallery showed the work of young contemporary artists such as Eric Fischl, Jean-Michel Basquiat and David Salle, as the New York City space mounted exhibitions dedicated to the history of The New York School, Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art by showing the earlier work of Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Willem de Kooning. In 1985, the business expanded from Los Angeles to New York. In 1986, Gagosian opened a second space on West 23rd Street in Manhattan.Jeffrey Hogrefe, \\"Gagosian Pays $5.75 Million for Largest Gallery in Chelsea,\\" The New York Observer, August 22, 1999 1990s In 1989, a new and more spacious gallery opened in New York City at 980 Madison Avenue with the inaugural exhibition: \\"The Maps of Jasper Johns.\\" During its first two years, the Madison Avenue space, once used by Sotheby's, presented work by Yves Klein, Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly and Jackson Pollock. Shortly after, artists such as Walter de Maria, Philip Taaffe, Francesco Clemente, and Peter Halley joined the gallery. Gagosian Gallery‚Äôs second New York City location opened in the neighborhood of SoHo, then the heart of the New York art scene, in 1991. Shortly before, the gallery had wooed David Salle and Philip Taaffe from long-term relationships with the Mary Boone Gallery.Grace Glueck (June 24, 1991), One Art Dealer Who's Still a High Roller New York Times. The new venue served to show large-scale works by artists such as Richard Serra, Mark di Suvero, Barnett Newman, and Chris Burden. The downtown location showed younger artists such as Ellen Gallagher, Jenny Saville, Douglas Gordon and Cecily Brown. The uptown gallery maintained its commitment to historical exhibitions by showing monumental sculptures by Mir√≥, Calder and Moore. Andy Warhol was exhibited at both New York galleries, in collaboration with the Andy Warhol Foundation, including exhibitions of his Rorschach Paintings, Camouflage Paintings, Late Hand-Painted Paintings, Oxidation Paintings and the Diamond Dust Shadow Paintings. In 1996, The Damien Hirst exhibition \\"No Sense of Absolute Corruption,\\" was the first exhibition in America to show Hirst‚Äôs animals in formaldehyde tanks, a controversial series of the artist‚Äôs oeuvre. Gagosian opened a location in Beverly Hills designed by architect Richard Meier in 1995. The Beverly Hills gallery mounted exhibitions by Edward Ruscha, Nan Goldin, Frank Gehry, Jeff Koons and Richard Prince. It also showed modern artists such as Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein and Abstract Expressionism group exhibitions. To finance Koons's giant \\"Celebration\\" sculptures, a consortium of dealers, including Gagosian, spent years helping the artist line up buyers willing to prepay for them. The buyers paid $2 million to $8 million apiece to own one of the artist' car-sized sculptures of balloon dogs and candy-colored hearts.Kelly Crow (April 1, 2011), The Gagosian Effect Wall Street Journal. In 1999, Gagosian Gallery moved from SoHo to West 24th Street, in New York‚Äôs industrial Chelsea. Richard Gluckman designed the gallery in which Richard Serra presented the monumental sculpture, ‚ÄúSwitch,‚Äù in November 1999. The new space was fully completed in September. The large viewing space at West 24th Street allowed Gagosian artists, such as Richard Serra and Damien Hirst, to exhibit large scale works with great flexibility. 2000s In spring of 2000, Gagosian became an international gallery with the opening of a Caruso St John-designed space on Heddon Street in Piccadilly, London, then the largest commercial art gallery in the city.Charlotte Higgins (May 10, 2004), King's Cross a Go-Go as top US art dealer unveils new gallery The Guardian. The UK gallery inaugurated its exhibitions program with a performance by the Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft, followed by an exhibition of works by Chris Burden. In September 2000, in New York, Gagosian held the Hirst show, Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings. A second London Gallery, also designed by Caruso St John, on Britannia Street, opened in May 2004 with a paintings and sculpture show by Cy Twombly. Comparable to the Chelsea exhibition space in size, this addition was then the largest commercial art gallery in London. It accommodated large sculpture, video pieces and installations such as Martin Kippenberger's show, The Magical Misery Tour, Brazil. The Heddon Street location closed in July 2005, and a new storefront space on Davies Street opened simultaneously with an exhibition of Pablo Picasso prints. To complement the West 24th Street gallery, a Richard Gluckman designed space on West 21st Street opened in October 2006. A joint exhibition with the 24th Street gallery, Cast a Cold Eye: The Late Works of Andy Warhol, launched Gagosian Gallery‚Äôs second location in Chelsea and third location in New York. In 2009, the 21st Street gallery held an exhibition of Pablo Picasso‚Äôs late works entitled Mosqueteros, curated by Picasso historian John Richardson. The Madison Avenue location introduced a fifth-floor gallery space, set up to focus more on young and upcoming artists. Featuring works by Hayley Tompkins and Anselm Reyle, Old Space New Space inaugurated the space in January 2007. The fifth-floor gallery has since showcased the works of Steven Parrino, Mark Grotjahn and Isa Genzken, Dan Colen and Dash Snow, among others. From 2007 on, Gagosian Gallery has also shown at the art gallery of the Eden Rock St Barths, Saint Barth√©lemy, including an exhibition of Richard Prince (2007). Gagosian opened a gallery in Rome in 2007, exhibiting new works by Cy Twombly. The Italian space is a refurbished former bank on Via Francesco Crispi, built in 1921 and redesigned by Rome-based architect Firouz Galdo in collaboration with Caruso St John. The renovation transformed the classical space into a contemporary gallery while retaining its Roman character. The main banking hall of the building had a huge bay window, and the architects have remodelled the opposite, formerly perpendicular, wall to create an oval space, with plenty of daylight coming through the windows.Peter Pophamin (December 17, 2007), Gagosian turns to Rome for next stage of his art empire The Independent. In November 2008, Gagosian Gallery expanded its Madison Avenue gallery to the fourth floor, with an inaugural exhibition of works by Francis Bacon and Alberto Giacometti in Isabel and Other Intimate Strangers, in collaboration with the Giacometti Foundation and the Bacon Foundation. Between 2003 and 2008, artists who had previously been represented by other renowned galleries joined Gagosian, such as Anselm Reyle from Gavin Brown's Enterprise; John Currin from Andrea Rosen; Mike Kelley from Metro Pictures; Tom Friedman from Feature; Takashi Murakami from Marianne Boesky; and Richard Phillips from Friedrich Petzel.Roberta Smith (April 18, 2008), Dear Gallery: It Was Fun, but I‚Äôm Moving Up New York Times. On the other hand, several artists left the stable for smaller galleries, including Tom Friedman, Mark di Suvero, and Ghada Amer. The estate of Willem de Kooning went to rival Pace Gallery in 2010. 2010s In 2010, Gagosian opened its Paris gallery on 350-square-meter (3,757 square feet) at 4, rue de Ponthieu, where it debuted with an exhibition of five new acrylic abstracts and five bronze sculptures by Cy Twombly. Priced between $4 million and $5 million each, all the paintings sold before the gallery officially opened.Scott Reyburn (October 25, 2010), Gagosian Sells $20 Million Art in Paris, Plans Global Growth Bloomberg'. Located off Rue du Rh√¥ne in Geneva's business district, a 140-square-metre Art Deco space was opened as the gallery's Swiss outpost later that year. In early 2011, the gallery, which has had a representative in Hong Kong since 2008, opened a facility at the Pedder Building there.Alexandra A. Seno (December 10, 2010), At Last, a Gagosian Space in Hong Kong Wall Street Journal Blog. The outpost was inaugurated with an exhibition by Damien Hirst. That year, a survey of dealers in The Wall Street Journal estimated that Gagosian Gallery's annual sales approached $1 billion. In May 2011 alone, roughly half the works for sale by the major auction houses in New York (evening sales only) were by artists on the gallery's roster.Eric Konigsberg (January 28, 2013), The Trials of Art Superdealer Larry Gagosian New York Magazine'. In October 2012, Gagosian Gallery opened a new gallery outside of Paris in Le Bourget. Designed by architect Jean Nouvel, the space is the 12th Gagosian location worldwide. The sixteenth Gagosian Gallery opened in San Francisco in May 2016, with a VIP opening attended by some of the nation's wealthiest art buyers. Gagosian has a global presence with 17 exhibition spaces in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Paris, Rome, Athens, Geneva, Hong Kong and Basel, designed by world-renowned architects including Caruso St John, Richard Gluckman, Richard Meier, Jean Nouvel, Selldorf Architects, and wHY Architecture.

The railroad leases a 5-mile portion of the former New York Central Railroad Catskill Mountain branch from Kingston to Stony Hollow, New York. The tracks are owned by Ulster County, New York which bought them in 1979 from estate of the Penn Central Railroad. The railroad's current permit with Ulster County expires on December 31, 2020. History Catskill Mountain Railroad The seal of the Catskill Mountain Railroad has been used as decoration on railroad equipment and structures In 1973, the Catskill Mountain Transportation Corp. \\"CMCT\\" was formed with the goal of purchasing the former Ulster and Delaware Railroad for freight and passenger service. In 1979, Ulster County purchased the portion of the former Ulster and Delaware Railroad from MP 2.9 to MP 41.4, a total of 38.6 miles, with the goal of resuming freight service and initiating a tourist train. The line had ceased passenger operations in 1954 and freight operations in 1976. In 1980 and 1981, members of the Kingston Model Railroad club cleared brush on the line. In 1982 members of the CMCT and the Kingston Model Railroad club formed the Catskill Mountain Railroad \\"CMRR\\", with the purpose of operating freight and passenger service on the former Ulster and Delaware Railroad from Kingston to Highmount, NY, a total of 38.6 miles of track. In 1982, Ulster County leased its entire 38.6 mile portion of the line to the CMRR. On August 9, 1982, CMRR initially began operations in Phoenicia, using track cars and trailers to haul tourists and tubers three miles along Esopus Creek to Mt. Pleasant station. The railroad was incorporated on March 7, 1983 as a for-profit railroad corporation in the state of New York. William Haysom was its first President. In 1985, the CMRR began running full-sized equipment consisting of CMRR No.1, \\"The Duck\\", a flat car and caboose. Earl Pardini became president to help guide them through the transition. Pardini was with the D&U; at its startup, helping to train its engineers and conductors. He agreed to come aboard, and the CMRR embarked on a period of serious expansion. Pardini had been a member of the former CMCT, and was brakeman on the last freight train in 1976. In 1986, Ulster County reconnected the line with Conrail at Kingston. The railroad purchased a variety of second-hand locomotives, coaches and freight cars which were shipped by rail to Kingston. Some of the equipment was refurbished and used immediately, while the rest sat in storage until needed. Also in 1986, the CMRR signed its first multi-year lease with Ulster County, for five years, and began switching freight for the Kingston Recycling Center as well as operating tourist train service from Phoenicia to Mt. Tremper, New York. In 1987, a devastating flood washed out Campground Curve, between Phoenicia and Mt. Tremper. In conjunction with NYSDOT and Ulster County, this damage was repaired and service restored in 1988. Operations focused on Phoenicia to Mt. Tremper, with limited operations in Kingston. Expansion and Setbacks 1991-2005 The railroad entered into a 25-year lease with Ulster County in 1991. Railroad operations ended at busy Route 28 in Mt. Pleasant. The crossing had been out of service for many years, and the railroad needed to replace it if it was to continue east toward Kingston. The project received approval and after about ten years, public funding was provided to complete reconstruction of the crossing and installation of warning lights and gates. The new crossing was put into service in October 2004, offering the railroad its first significant expansion. Then tragedy struck CMRR. On April 1, 2005, a devastating flood nearly wiped out the railroad, and caused much damage to the tracks and equipment in Phoenicia. After several weeks of volunteer effort, the line was reopened in summer 2005. Around this time, interest increased in using some segments of the rail corridor in Ulster County for a recreational trail. Volunteer Resurgence During the winter of 2006, the railroad reorganized its efforts as new volunteers came forward. A group from the nearby Ulster & Delaware Railroad Historical Society were among the first to offer assistance. Brush-cutting and clearing the right of way took first priority. A high- profile activity with immediate results, the cleanup effort motivated more volunteers to join. By the end of 2006, the volunteer force had increased to 45 full members and 30 provisional members. They cleared nearly 20 miles of brush from the mainline. Kingston Operations Resume In 2007 the railroad began track repairs in Kingston in line with the \\"ski lift\\" concept recommended in the ALTA Engineering study for railroad operation from Kingston to West Hurley. The railroad restored tracks in Kingston, with service opening to Washington Avenue in December 2008. In late 2009, the railroad opened more track west of Washington Avenue and offered additional seasonal service throughout that year. From 2007 to 2009, close to two miles of track had been rebuilt in Kingston, from Cornell Street to the foot of Bridge C9. For three years, the CMRR worked to complete the rehabilitation of Bridge C9 over Esopus Creek in Kingston. The bridge was opened for service on December 7, 2012, enabling track rehabilitation westward with Route 209 being the first destination. Route 209, MP 5.42, was reached on September 21, 2013, and Hurley Mountain Road, MP 5.94, was reached on November 16, 2014. The track is now open to MP 6.45 west of Hurley Mountain Road. The first passenger train to Route 209 ran on October 19, 2013, and the first to Hurley Mountain Road on November 21, 2014. West End Expansion Through 2007 and 2008, work also continued on opening the .6 mile Cold Brook Extension. The first train arrived at Cold Brook Station on July 4, 2008: the first regularly scheduled passenger train to arrive at the station since 1954. Because Cold Brook station remains privately owned, the railroad maintained no agency there and there are no facilities to board or discharge passengers. In 2009, the CMRR repaired track another .8 miles to the Boiceville Bridge at MP 21.3, for work trains only. By 2010, the physical limit of track restoration was reached on the \\"western\\" end of the operable railroad. To the west of Bridge Street in Phoenicia is a major washout preventing any serious restoration work without outside funding. To the east, the railroad rebuilt tracks up to the limit of Bridge C30 (Boiceville Trestle). This was a total of 6.4 miles of operable track at its greatest extent. alt=Construction equipment and workers in a stony depression at the side of a body of water on the left. Bent railroad tracks dangle into it from the foreground; traffic is backed up on a road in the rear  Hurricane Irene  On August 28, 2011, CMRR was devastated by flooding as a result of Hurricane Irene. Flood waters inundated the yard at Phoenicia, scouring the right of way and threatening the depot. A significant washout occurred at Campground Curve, similar to the one in 1987. All operating equipment had been moved to safe ground at Mt. Tremper, east of Campground Curve. Additional damage had been incurred where damage from a previous washout was already underway. In the non-operating segment east of Cold Brook station, the most significant damage was the loss of three of the four spans of Boiceville Trestle (Bridge C30) to rising flood waters. There was no significant damage to the restored tracks in the Kingston area. The CMRR resumed operations on September 10, 2011, on a shortened length of track near Mount Tremper. The washout at Campground Curve was repaired in late 2011, except for reinstallation of track. Operations west of Mt. Tremper commenced on August 5, 2012. In November 2012, the County informed the CMRR that several repair projects had been approved by FEMA. Seven projects, including restoration of the Boiceville Trestle, were approved for $2.3 million. However, the County informed CMRR that it would not begin the projects unless CMRR agreed to terminate its lease from Kingston to the Ashokan Reservoir. On August 3, 2013, the CMRR started reconstruction work of track on Campground Curve as part of returning to Phoenicia. This was done assuming that the county would not initiate a FEMA-funded project for this repair. The CMRR completed repairs to Phoenicia on August 7, 2015. Ironically, these repairs made possible the future new railbiking use for this segment of the railroad.Phoenicia Station, site of the Empire State Railway Museum At the end of its 25-year lease with Ulster County on May 31, 2016, the CMRR ran from Phoenicia at MP 27.5 to the washout at MP 23.3, as the FEMA funds were never released for the trestle and washout repairs.  Litigation with Ulster County  In 2013, Ulster County attempted to terminate the CMRR's lease three years before its expiration. The CMRR successfully litigated the attempt to terminate its lease at a cost of $700,000. The litigation was settled in April 2016, and the CMRR was allowed to continue its former lease through its natural expiration on May 31, 2016.  New Permit  In August 2016, the CMRR signed a new permit with Ulster County for a five-mile segment from MP 3.6 at Chandler Drive in Kingston to MP 8.3 in Stony Hollow. The new permit expires on December 31, 2020. This segment did not include its yard in Kingston nor the former west end operation out of Phoenicia. Only one short siding was included in this permit area. Nevertheless, the CMRR continued renovating track operating on the full length of its permit area opening all its permitted track in 2019. Operations Kingston-West Hurley Since November 2006, the CMRR has re-opened track in Kingston. The passenger operable section stretches from Chandler Drive at MP 3.6 to Stony Hollow at MP 8.3. On December 6, 2008, the railroad inaugurated seasonal tourist runs between Downs Street (MP 3.2) and Washington Avenue (MP 4.37). A small ticket office and loading platform was constructed off Westbrook Lane (MP 3.78) opposite Kingston Plaza to support passenger operations in 2008. Trains are powered by Alco RS-1 401 (ex-GMRC 401), and consist of converted flatcar 278 (ex-LBR 26) and refurbished caboose 675 (ex-PRR 477672) and several Ex-LIRR P72 coaches. The critical Washington Avenue crossing was reopened for limited use in 2008, and the track was opened to Bridge C-9 (MP 5) on November 15, 2009 for the 2009 Kingston Holiday Train. Repairs to Bridge C9 started in September 2011, and were completed on December 3, 2012. The bridge was certified on December 7, 2012, and the first passenger train ran across the bridge on December 8. On September 21, 2013, CMRR workers completed track rehabilitation up to NYS Route 209 (MP 5.42). The next day, work began on the next extension past 209 to Hurley Mountain Road (MP 5.94). In late 2014 track was expanded to MP 6.13, and in late 2015 to MP 6.45, over 1/2 mile west of Hurley Mountain Road. The operable section was extended to MP 6.67 in 2018 and to MP 8.3 in Stony Hollow in 2019. CMRR also had a yard in Kingston, referred to as \\"Cornell Street Yard.\\" In 2009, a new siding was constructed to expand the yard facilities to allow for the storage and restoration of passenger cars for expanded tourist train operations. The CMRR was forced to vacate the yard by the County on May 1, 2016. Before its lease expired in 2016, the line was reopened for work trains to MP 11 on the Glenford Dike at the Ashokan Reservoir. The track from MP 10 to MP 11 was removed in 2018 for the Ashokan Rail Trail. Phoenicia-Cold Brook The CMRR operated a tourist excursion train from Phoenicia Railroad Station, Phoenicia, MP 27.5 to Cold Brook Railroad Station, MP 22.1 until October 31, 2016. Its trains originated from the former U&D; station in Phoenicia, which is also home to the Empire State Railway Museum. Passengers boarded trains at Phoenicia or Mount Tremper Railroad Station, MP 25.2. Initially, service was provided by track cars hauling trailers between Phoenicia and Mount Tremper. Realizing that the future lies in conventional railroad equipment hauled by locomotives, two flatcars were rebuilt as open air bench cars to accommodate passengers. A Porter 50-ton switcher was enlisted to haul the expanded consist. A 1922-vintage wooden caboose often (ex-D&H; 35952) brought up the rear, and offered additional capacity. In early 2004 the caboose was taken out of service and replaced with a restored coach of Lackawanna heritage. This coach greatly increased the capacity of each train, and also helped offer \\"all- weather\\" service. In late 2004, service was extended to MP 22.7. It was extended further to Cold Brook Station, MP 22.1, on July 4, 2008. On May 6, 2010, Phoenicia operations acquired a new locomotive, former LIRR/SIRY Alco S1 407, which was placed in service on May 7, 2010. It has been the workhorse engine for Phoenicia operations since the start of the 2010 season. A second coach was put into service on October 2, 2010, just in time for the Fall Foliage trains. In 2011, construction of a new switch and siding began at MP 24.75, to park maintenance equipment and give the work train a place to alight. It was completed on May 25, 2012. For the 2012 season, the train ran initially from Mt. Tremper west to MP 23.3 where subgrade repairs are necessary due to Hurricane Irene. On August 5, 2012, after repairs were made at MP 25.5, the passenger train began running west to the next damaged section at MP 25.8, one half mile west of Mt. Tremper. On August 6, 2015, service was restored to Phoenicia Station after extensive track repairs were completed by the CMRR. Work trains generally consisted of transfer caboose 697 (ex-CR 18015) and \\"The Duck,\\" a small Davenport switcher. Equipment restoration and maintenance takes place at the railroad's open-air facilities. The original Phoenicia section house is used by the railroad to store tools and supplies for the track crew. On August 4, 2016, CMRR was granted a permit to resume operations on this segment of the U&D; Corridor through October 31, 2016. However, the county has elected to use a rail bike (www.railexplorers.net) company as the operator for this segment starting in 2017. The CMRR moved all its equipment to its adjacent property in Phoenicia in January, 2017, where it remains today. In May, 2017 Rail Explorers announced it would not be operating on the western section of the line in 2017, however it opened for operations in 2018. Shokan Under its prior lease, the CMRR's third base of operations was at MP 16.4 at Shokan, New York, at the site of the former Ashokan Railroad Station. The operating equipment there consisted of a self- powered crane, flat car, and an ex-Susquehanna caboose (privately owned). Shokan also served as a base for the CMRR's track car crews, who were charged with maintenance of the section of the line inaccessible to full sized equipment, from MP 11 to bridge C30 at MP 21.3. The CMRR removed all its equipment in Shokan by rail on July 21, 2016. All tracks at Shokan were removed in 2018 to make way for the Ashokan Rail Trail. Ridership The CMRRs ridership dramatically increased with the addition of Polar Express and Thomas the Tank engine events in Kingston in 2014. Historic ridership is as follows: 2008 - Kingston 884, Phoenicia 7,155, total 8,039 2009 - Kingston 1,546, Phoenicia 6,767, total 8,313 2010 - Kingston 2,044, Phoenicia 10,211, total 12,255 2011 - Kingston 2,618, Phoenicia 6,684, total 9,302 2012 - Kingston 3,065, Phoenicia 8,463, total 11,528 2013 - Kingston 4,575, Phoenicia, 10,248, total 14,823 2014 - Kingston, 31,289, Phoenicia, 8,981, total 40,270 2015 - Kingston, 27,230, Phoenicia, 12,129, total 39,359 2016 - Kingston, 29,148, Phoenicia, 9,595, total 38,743 2017 - Kingston, 36,513 2018 - Kingston, 37,619 2019 - Kingston, 41,115 In 2019, through credit card receipts, the CMRR broke down its ridership as follows: Kingston and Ulster County - 11.8%; Long Island and NYC - 20.8%; Rockland and Sullivan Counties - 5.9%; Orange County - 10.8%; Westchester and Putnam County - 12.2%; Dutchess County - 10.2%; Capital Region - 6.2%; Other NYS - 1.2%; New Jersey - 4.3%; Other US - 5.7%; International - .1%; Walk-ons - 10.8%. Long-term goals Kingston-Glenford Dike (MP 3.6 to 11.1) Although the CMRR is only currently allowed to operate to MP 8.33 in Stony Hollow, the railroad may eventually be allowed to operate to Basin Road at MP 10.01 at the border of the NYCDEP easement. The tracks from MP 8.33 to MP 10.01 remain in place. The CMRR has requested of the County and the NYCDEP both a short extension to MP 10.3 so that it can bring passengers to the new rail trail trailhead on the Ashokan Reservoir Trail. If this permission is granted, rail will need to be re-laid past MP 10.01, as the rail west of that location was removed in 2018. Additionally, the CMRR has requested from the County and the NYCDEP a further extension to the Glenford Dike at MP 11.1 so that it can run lunch, dinner and scenic trains. Interchange with CSX at Kingston (MP 2.9 to 3.6) The CMRR has been isolated from the national network since Conrail removed its Kingston interchange switch in 1996. The CMRR plans to eventually reconnect its line to the national rail network: CSX (successor to Conrail) at Kingston, despite the fact that rail was removed from MP 3.2 to MP 3.6 in 2018 to make way for the Kingston Midtown Linear Park Rail Trail. However, the CMRR continues to ask the county to reserve a rail right-of-way in this section so that the line can eventually be reconnected to CSX for equipment moves, charters, and occasional freight movements. Boiceville-Phoenicia Station (MP 21.59 to 27.5) The tracks from Boiceville to Phoenicia have been left in place and are now leased to Rail Explorers. The CMRR hopes eventually to restore rail service on this segment alongside the current rail bicycle operator. The CMRR continues to store rail equipment on its land opposite the Phoenicia Station. This segment is divided by a severe washout at MP 23.3 from Hurricane Irene in 2011, that prohibits rail service (rail bikes or trains) from MP 21.59 to MP 23.3. Phoenicia Station to Bridge Street (MP 27.5 to 27.85) These tracks are currently leased to the Empire State Railway Museum. The CMRR hopes to eventually share this trackage with the ESRM in Phoenicia. Kingston- Phoenicia (MP 2.9 to 27.85) The CMRR's former long-term goal was to run tourist trains on the entire 25-mile run from Kingston to Phoenicia. The goal was negated on November 14, 2017, when the Ulster County legislature voted to remove the tracks from the middle third of the line for a rail trail. The tracks from MP 10.01 to MP 21.59 were removed in 2018. West of Phoenicia (MP 27.85 to 41.4) The CMRR has never had plans to reopen this section of the line to service. However, the neighboring DURR in Delaware County has expressed interest in resuming service possibly all the way to Big Indian (MP 36.4). It currently leases a run-around from Ulster County from MP 41.2 to 41.4. Ulster County has no current plans for trail conversion of this section, but it is designated as trail-only in the county's long-term plans. Stations and Maintenance Yards The CMRR's current station at Westbrook Lane is temporary and the railroad seeks a permanent station in Kingston for its operations. Four locations have been proposed by the CMRR: 1) West End of Kingston Plaza; 2) Center of Kingston Plaza; 3) Best Western (near Washington Avenue); and 4) Midtown (at the former Kingston Train Station {near the CSX connection). To date no location has been worked out with the County and the City of Kingston. Since being removed from its long-term yard at Cornell Street in Kingston, the CMRR has proposed four locations for a permanent yard at alternate locations in Kingston. To date no location has been worked out with the County and the City of Kingston. This forces the CMRR to store and maintain all its equipment out in the open on the main line. Proposed Track Additions The CMRR currently operates on a 5-mile track with a single 150 foot siding In Kingston, making operations and switching extremely difficult. The CMRR has requested permission to install a run-around siding in Kingston and one at its eventual western terminus to eventually allow engine-first operation on the entire line. Roster of equipment Locomotives No. 29 CMRR owns two American Locomotive Company (ALCO) RS-1 locomotives, No. 401 (Ex-Green Mountain Railroad (GMRC) No. 401, Ex Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad (GM&O;) No. 1052, Ex Illinois Terminal Railroad No. 1056, n√©e 756); and No. 2361 (former Alter Scrap No. 2361, Ex-Soo Line Railroad (SOO) 2361). Only 401 is operational at this time. In 2010, 2361 was repainted and evaluated for reactivation; it was given a new number, 400. In May 2010, the CMRR acquired its latest locomotive, former Long Island Railroad/Staten Island Railway Alco S-1 407. This engine was the workhorse for operations out of Mt. Tremper and Phoenicia, but now remains in storage. CMRR No. 29, \\"The Goat\\" is an Ex-Navy 50 ton H. K. Porter, Inc locomotive, which was a backup engine and main engine for worktrain service. CMRR No. 1, \\"The Duck\\", another worktrain locomotive, is an Ex-Army 38 ton Davenport Locomotive Works locomotive. Only \\"the Duck\\" is operational and is located currently in Phoenicia. It has a double-reduction gearing system in the trucks. The traction motors are mounted at 90 degrees to the axles, and have bevel pinions on the armature shafts. These bevel pinions drive a larger bevel ring gear in a gear case. On one truck, the locking nut on the traction motor armature shaft came loose, and the bevel pinion jammed in the ring gear, locking up the truck. The bevel pinion jammed against the ring gear and bent it. #29 is currently for sale and remains in storage in Phoenicia. In 2014, the CMRR acquired a 1942 GE 45-tonner, numbered 42, from the Railroad Museum of New England. The locomotive is currently locatedin Kingston.No. 42 Passenger equipment Phoenicia equipment consists of two Ex-Navy 50 foot flatcars, No. 271 and 272, that have been converted to open- air passenger service with the addition of side walls and benches, which were moved to Kingston in August 2020. There are also two former Erie Lackawanna Railway (EL) Multiple unit (MU) trailers that have been completely renovated: No. 4321 entered service as CMRR No. 701 in 2004, and No. 4332 entered service on October 2, 2010 as CMRR No. 702. Another MU trailer, No. 4322, has recently been moved from storage at Kingston for restoration back to active service. It will most likely be numbered as CMRR No. 703 upon completion. Kingston equipment consists of two flat cars, one 40-foot, CMRR No. 278 (ex-Lowville & Beaver River No. 26), and another 50-foot (ex-Army No. 35112), which are each fitted with a canopy roof, five former Long Island Rail Road commuter coaches, CMRR 2940, 2949, 2962, 2918 and 2911, and an N5B Caboose, CMRR No. 675 (Ex-PRR 477672, PC 22800, CR 20003). The CMRR also owns Ontario Northern 832 (former Norfolk & Western No. 1727) and is renovating the car for first class service. Another U.S. Army 50 foot flatcar has been converted to passenger use. No. 35111, which was moved from Phoenicia to Kingston in 2019. It has been fitted with a canopy roof. Other equipment CMRR also rosters several pieces of freight equipment used in work train and storage service. In Kingston, this includes two 50-foot boxcars, former D&H; 26076 and NYC 72462, used for storage. An ex-Army Difco dump car and 40-foot flat car (CMRR 201 (Ex LBR No. 27)) are used for work train service. Additionally, the railroad has in storage west of Kingston a ballast hopper (former NYC No. 51467) and a gondola (former PRR No. 518399). Additionally in Kingston the CMRR owns a self-powered ex-Navy crane, CMRR 991, a 40-foot tender flat CMRR 291 (ex-Army 35305), and uses a privately owned caboose CMRR 674 (ex Susquehanna 117), all used for work train service. The frame and trucks of former LS&I; caboose No. 6, which were bought by a CMRR volunteer in the 1980s, are in storage in Phoenicia. In Phoenicia, a 40-foot box car (Ex-LV 65100) is used for storage, and a former Army Difco dump car, a 40-foot flatcar, CMRR 202 (Ex-CV 7704) and an N6A transfer caboose, CMRR 697 (Ex NYC/PC/CR 18015), are used for worktrain service. Phoenicia equipment also includes a privately owned N5G steel caboose, CMRR 673 (former Lehigh Valley 95041). This caboose was used as a gift shop at Mt. Tremper for many years before it was returned to the rails in 2010. U&D; Corridor Transitions On January 24, 2006, when the Kingston Daily Freeman announced \\"Trail Plan Could Mark End of Line for Railroad\\", trail advocates began promoting a plan to convert segments of the county-owned railroad corridor into a recreational path, which would limit the length and location of the tourist train excursions. ALTA Engineering was hired to devise a rail-with-trail plan for the line in Ulster County. The final report stated the following: On October 4, 2012, Ulster County Executive Michael P. Hein announced in his 2013 budget a plan to remove 32 miles of rails in Ulster County to be replaced by a trail, leaving the Phoenicia-Cold Brook segment, and ending Kingston operations. He planned to start removing rails in 2013, using $642,000 in scrapping revenues to provide revenue for his budget. The budget was adopted by the Ulster County Legislature on December 4, 2012. The CMRR's lease, however, remains in effect until May 31, 2016. There is no reference to scrapping the railroad in the proposed 2014 Ulster County Budget. Three days after the 2013 budget was approved, the CMRR opened Bridge C9 in Kingston for passenger train service, and began bringing passengers across the bridge for the first time in over 50 years. On February 19, 2013, CMRR published a rail-with-trail study for MP 3 to 11 in response to a request from the county made on October 15, 2012. The rail-with-trail plan was rejected without review by the county on March 7, 2013. On June 5, 2013, Ulster County hired Andrea C. Ferster, Esq, who was also general counsel to the Rails to Trails Conservancy, to file an application to the Surface Transportation Board to \\"rail bank\\" the railroad for future trail use. On June 12, 2013, CMRR was served with a Notice to Cure. In a meeting with the Ulster County Executive, held on June 24, 2013, the CMRR was asked to vacate the line from Kingston to the Ashokan reservoir, and told that unless it complied, its lease would be terminated on July 12. CMRR filed a Yellowstone Injunction on July 9 and was granted a TRO prohibiting the county from terminating the lease pending the outcome of a court decision on August 6. The Yellowstone Injunction was granted on November 6, 2013. Ulster County issued a notice of appeal on December 17, 2013. On December 11, 2013, the outgoing New York City DEP commissioner announced a plan to support a trail along the U&D; right of way from MP 10 to MP 21.6. On December 8, 2014, the Ulster County Executive announced that, assuming certain requirements were met, a little more than two miles of tourist passenger train service could remain in Kingston, from the eastern end of Kingston Plaza, MP 3.6, to Hurley Mountain Road, MP 5.94. On April 19, 2015, the Ulster County Legislature passed a resolution to create a nine-member legislator only committee to study the entire U&D; corridor in Ulster County and make recommendations on long term use, including rail, trail or rail with trail with recommendations due by November 30, 2015. On May 15, 2015, the Ulster County Legislature passed a resolution to sign a Memorandum of Agreement with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to begin spending planning dollars on a future conversion of the 11.5 mile railroad easement owned by the county in the Ashokan Reservoir to trail use. On December 15, 2015, Stone Consulting completed a report on the Highest and Best uses of the U&D; Corridor. On December 15, 2015, the Ulster County Legislature passed a resolution making rail with trail the official policy from Chandler Drive (MP 3.58) in Kingston to just past 28a in Stony Hollow (MP 8.33), allowing the railroad to continue operations in Kingston and for 4.75 miles west. The segment from 28a to MP 10 will be studied further \\"provided that trail connectivity co-located on the corridor shall be preserved\\". This gives the CMRR a potential long-term home in Kingston and could allow the railroad to expand west as far as MP 10. It also confirmed that rail will remain from the Route 28a bridge in Boiceville (MP 21.6) to Phoenicia (MP 27.9). Any further rail expansion along the north side of the Ashokan Reservoir would be dependent on consent from the NYCDEP and the Ulster County Legislature. The Stone Consulting report found there were no physical restrictions to rail alongside trail from MP 10 to 11, with the only restriction to rail use being imposed by the agreement between Ulster County and NYCDEP. This resolution effectively ends the fight on rail vs. trail on the former U&D; corridor, with rail and trail proponents pledging to work together from now on. On April 19, 2016, the County and the CMRR settled their lawsuit contingent on the CMRR vacating its yard at Cornell Street in Kingston on May 1, 2016, ceasing operations on May 31, 2016 (the end of its lease term), and removing its equipment from the railroad by July 30, 2016. The litigation cost the CMRR $700,000, but allowed the railroad to operate to the end of its lease with Ulster County on May 31, 2016. On July 18, 2016, the Ulster County Executive announced that permits had been signed for the CMRR to continue operating in Kingston from MP 3.6 to 8.33 until December 31, 2020, and from MP 23.3 to 27.8 until October 31, 2016. The permits were issued on August 4, 2016, and service resumed on August 6, 2016. On December 14, 2017, the Ulster County Legislature voted to remove all railroad tracks from MP 10.01 to MP 21.59, permanently severing the U&D; Corridor, and eliminating the CMRR's plans to return to the Glenford Dike and Phoenicia with full-service passenger operations. In July 2018, A state Supreme Court justice has dismissed yet another claim against Ulster County over its plan to create a recreational trail along portions of the former Ulster & Delaware Railroad corridor.https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/ulster-county-wins-another-round- in-legal-battle-over- creating/article_df83e331-7480-5e8d-9a95-769be9d75504.html http://ulstercountyny.gov/news/executive-press-releases/catskill-mountain- railroad-signs-multi-year-permit-ulster-county Photo gallery Image:CMRR Engine 29.jpg|No. 29 in action Image:CMRR Car 701.jpg|Car No. 701 Image:CMRR Car 271.jpg|Car No. 271 Image:CMRR Phoenicia Sign.jpg|Phoenicia Station NRHP marker Image:CMRR Marker 1.jpg|Flanger Sign Image:CMRR Marker 2.jpg|Mile marker Image:CMRR Mount Pleasant.jpg|Mount Pleasant station Image:CMRR Marker 4.jpg|Whistle post Image:CMRR Marker 5.jpg|Flanger Sign Image:CMRR Marker 3.jpg|Yard limit marker File:CMRR Kingston Shuttle.jpg|Kingston Holiday Shuttle at Westbrook Station Image:CMRR.Kingston.Shuttle.Washington.Avenue.jpg|Kingston Holiday Shuttle at Washington Avenue See also *Kingston, New York railroad stations References External links *Catskill Mountain Railroad Company *Save the Rails *Ulster County Resolution 488 Dated December 15, 2015 *Stone Consulting Report Dated December 15, 2015 *CMRR Kingston to Glenford Dike 2015-2020 Business Plan *CMRR Kingston to Glenford Dike 2020-2024 Business Plan *CMRR 2013 Timetable *CMRR Rail with Trail Study *CMRR 2012 Annual Progress Report *CMRR 2011 Annual Progress Report *CMRR 2010 Annual Progress Report *CMRR 2009 Annual Progress Report *CMRR 2008 Annual Progress Report *Comprehensive CMRR Equipment Roster *Delaware and Ulster Railroad *Empire State Railway Museum *Trolley Museum of New York (Kingston) *Ulster & Delaware Railroad Historical Society Category:Catskills Category:Heritage railroads in New York (state) Category:Kingston, New York Category:Railway companies established in 1982 Category:Transportation in Ulster County, New York Category:Tourist attractions in Ulster County, New York Category:1982 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Catskill Mountain Railroad"},{"id":"4518644","title":"NCAA Division I college baseball team statistics"},{"id":"4518647","text":"Bob Perelman (born December 2, 1947) is an American poet, critic, editor, and teacher. He was an early exponent of the Language poets, an avant-garde movement, originating in the 1970s. He has helped shape a \\"formally adventurous, politically explicit poetic practice in the United States\\", according to one of his chroniclers. Perelman is professor of English emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania. Personal life Robert Lawrence Perelman was born in 1947 to Mark and Evelyn Perelman. His father was a Youngstown, Ohio businessman and his mother had worked as a social worker. He was one of two siblings‚Äîa year and a half younger than his sister, Nancy. He attended the Putney School in Putney, Vermont from 1959, graduating in 1964‚Äîin the same class as his sister. Next, he attended the University of Rochester as a prospective concert pianist. There he changed his major from music and focused on his other strength, classical literature, having determined that he did not have a future in music. He then transferred to the University of Michigan to pursue that field in 1966. In 1969, he moved to Iowa City, Iowa to pursue his interest in poetry at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where he received a Master of Fine Arts. He returned to Michigan to obtain a Master of Arts in Greek and Latin. He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1975 Perelman married then Cambridge, Massachusetts artist, Francie Shaw, after a four-year relationship. They made their home sequentially in Cambridge, Hills, Iowa, San Francisco Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--finally returning to Berkeley, California.http://www.seguefoundation.com/roofbooks//books/perelman.html They have two sons, born in 1979 and 1983. Shaw's artwork appears in many of his works and he has dedicated each one to her. Career Perelman started his teaching career in 1975 with appearances at Hobart College, Northeastern University, and Cambridge Adult Education. Starting in 1990, Perelman received a teaching appointment at the University of Pennsylvania. He made teaching appearances at the University of Iowa, and King's College, London between 1996 and 1998. As of 2014, Perelman was a professor with the Department of English at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, teaching subjects, including, \\"Sounding Poetry: Music and Literature\\", \\"Topics in Modernism: Poetry and the New Woman\\", \\"British Poetry 1660-1914\\", \\"Poetics, Writing, Trending: Judgment and its Discontents\\", \\"The Sound of Poetry, the Poetry of Sound: from Homer to Langston Hughes\\", \\"Whitman and Williams: Contact, Utopia\\", and \\"American Poetry\\". Language writing movement Perelman was part of a poetic movement in the San Francisco Bay Area ca. 1970, called \\"Language writing\\" or \\"Language poetry\\", which movement was without a formal organization. Their works diverged from the \\"norms of persona-centered, 'expressive' poetry\\". The exponents of the movement, following the lead of such avant-garde writers as Gertrude Stein and Louis Zukofsky, engaged in \\"experimental modernism\\" and \\"avant-garde self-publishing\\" in what Perelman was quoted as having called the \\"opposition to the prevailing institutions of American Poetry\\", and \\"the still-dominant scenic monolog of the writing workshop\\". The group was cited as notable for \\"its sense of purpose, seriousness and demonstrable productivity\\". Perelman and fellow proponents of this writing movement wrote retrospectively that, \\"...the self as the central and final term of creative practice is being challenged and exploded in our writing.\\" One of the Perelman's poems, \\"China\\", evoked discussion as a focal point on the merits of Language poetry and received praise from Bruce Boone as being \\"problematically\\" beautiful.Bruce Boone, Language Writing‚ÄîThe pluses and minuses of the new formalism, Soup, #2 (1981) Frederic Jameson and George Hartley each used a discussion of the poem as an exemplar of Language poetry, Jameson to illustrate the Language poets' adoption of \\"schizophrenic fragmentation as their fundamental aesthetic\\" and Hartley to defend Language writing in general. In 1985 Perelman edited the proceedings of a series of talks by poets from this movement, entitled, Writing/Talks, which included contributions by Alan Davies, Carla Harryman, Barrett Watten, Lyn Hejinian, Robert Grenier, and others. Topics encompassed: writing, politics, popular culture, language, and the human body. Poetry As of 2014, Perelman had published over 15 volumes of poetry. The Dictionary of Literary Biography and Jacket magazine have compiled overviews of Perelman's body of work, Jacket with multiple contributors. Steve Evans, a 1998 contributor to the Dictionary of Literary Biography, wrote that Perelman had a significant role \\"in defining a formally adventurous, politically explicit poetic practice in the United States\\", using \\"a variety of forms, \\"from the conventional essay to the dramatic monologue, from the carefully measured units of verse to the giddily hybrid pleasures of all manner of counterfeiture\\". In Evan's view, Perelman developed a poetry of \\"radical deconcealment\\" that searches for the \\"deep structure of social experience beyond ... postmodernity\\". Contributors in a 2002 Jacket magazine feature on Perelman discussed aspects of his work. Alan Golding gave an overview of Perelman‚Äôs continuing dialectic between the avant- garde and academia in his body of poetry, subtitled \\"Pedagogy, Poetics, and Bob Perelman‚Äôs Pound\\", wherein he cast Ezra Pound as a forerunner of Perelman's interest in the pursuit of \\"poetic learning and poetic knowledge\\". Lyn Hejinian wrote that \\"there is no impulse anywhere in Bob Perelman‚Äôs writings, critical or poetic, toward totalization. Instead, his imagination plays strange host to an odd form of omniscience, one that doubts its own senses and eschews power.\\" Yet she ascribes to Perelman a scrutiny of the human uses of power through \\"persuasion, hypocrisy, deceit, and other powers of language; judicial and legislative and corporate ... power; powers of image and information and technology; familial and sexual powers.\\" Andrew Klobucar described Perelman‚Äôs poetry as using \\"dream-work\\" poetic elements, which \\"become key factors in the ongoing interplay between symbolic frameworks, ideology and knowledge construction that informs his writing practice.\\" Kit Robinson described the \\"sense of the sentence as life in fractal\\" as characteristic of Perelman's work. Nada Gordon wrote that Perelman is a poet of whom a curmudgeon might say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like language writing, except for Bob Perelman.‚Äù Joshua Schuster placed Perelman‚Äôs poetry into two sets, each tied to a geographic setting and to his avant-garde vs. academic literary environments. One set, stemming from his participation in the San Francisco avant-garde scene addressees \\"the spread of capitalist realism versus the withering of critical platforms, from the fading utopianism of the 60s, to the inability to sustain class or grass roots activism, to the dilution of the radicalism of desire by the near full invasion of commercialism into all human systems of affect. In most of these poems, the poet is thematized in a largely passive-aggressive manner, barely able to record let alone piece together the conflicts, never able to change the situation.\\" With the other set, pertaining to his Philadelphia and university-based work, Perelman transitions to \\"creating mixed forms that can engage with writing in the long run, to find out how eras of poetry such as the classics and modernism might repeat and reinvent themselves.\\" An excerpt from The Marginalization of Poetry gives a sense of Perelman's approach to writing and thinking about poetry, as it combines historical reference with literary analysis and criticism‚Äîin real time, of the very poem that one is reading‚Äîusing structured free verse delivered with humor and irony, first to question, then to hint, and finally to assert that the piece is a poem: > it's hard to think of any > poem where the word \\"marginalization\\" occurs. It is being used here, but > this may or may not be a poem: the couplets of six > word lines don't establish an audible rhythm; perhaps they haven't, to use > the Calvinist mercantile metaphor, \\"earned\\" their right to exist in their > present > form--is this a line break or am I simply chopping up > ineradicable prose? But to defend this (poem) from its own attack, I'll > say that both the flush left and irregular right margins constantly loom > as significant events, often interrupting what I thought I was about to > write and making me write something else entirely. Even though I'm going > back and rewriting, the problem still reappears every six words. So this, > and every poem, is a marginal work in a quite literal sense. Literary criticism Perelman wrote two works of literary criticism in book form, The Trouble with Genius, which examines the antecedents of the Language writing movement, and The Marginalization of Poetry, which comments in verse form on the history and historiography of that movement. According to Lilley, Language writers were \\"assemblages of young, experimental, left- identified writers, ... , [who] were motivated by what Perelman calls ‚Äôopposition to the prevailing institutions of American Poetry‚Äô\\" and took up the \\"tradition of experimental modernism and avant-garde self-publishing\\", neglected by academia. The Trouble with Genius Perelman's 1994 book, The Trouble with Genius, is a literary critique of his modernist forerunners, Pound, Joyce, Stein and Zukofsky. Al Filreis suggests that the book is primarily about how to reconcile the populist dimension of their works with the lack of accessibility of their poetics, owing to arcane historical references and opaque styles of writing. He suggests that Perelman has overcome this contradiction in his own writing, despite his efforts to maintain the high standard of his antecedents. Filreis cites ‚ÄúHistory is not a sentence‚Äù to portray Perelman looking back \\"in order to remind himself that the present, both required and sufficient, is only right there in the writing\\". He cites the poem ‚ÄúMovie\\", which describes a tessellation of history, including Nixon, Vietnam, Nicaragua, the Revolution of 1848, the Bastille, through the Reagan era, including the Iran-Contra saga of Oliver North. Steven Helming reported that Perelman spontaneously and wittily answers to the \\"surprises and quirks of difficult texts\\" of the authors studied, which discussion pairs Eduard Manet with Franz Kline, Ezra Pound with Theodor Adorno, Igor Stravinsky with John Dos Passos, Federico Fellini with Le Corbusier, and Vladimir Lenin with Dizzy Gillespie. Perelman demonstrates how literary criticism is akin to a paper/rock/scissors game, i.e. \\"poet beats critic\\"/\\"critic finds flaws in theoretical writing\\"/\\"theory subsumes any specific writing.\\" In doing so, Perelman brings fresh perspective to criticism of Modernist writing, according to Helming. The Marginalization of Poetry Perelman explained of his 1996 versified critique and guide to the Language poetry movement, The Marginalization of Poetry, that he was addressing academics, poets, and those unfamiliar with Language writing and that he \\"wanted to write criticism that was poetry and poetry that was criticism\\". Ron Silliman wrote that the book uses the tools of Language writing to portray that very subject and demonstrates that Language writers \\"do not, and never intended to, 'say the same thing'\\". Filreis admired Perelman's historiography in the verse, but suggested (along with Silliman) that Perelman‚Äôs move from avant-garde culture to academia had affected his perspective on the history of Language writing with this book. Peter Middleton supported this thesis with the observation the book was published by a major academic press, Princeton University Press in part to gain tenure as a professor, rather than one of the small, alternative presses of his earlier works. Middleton highlighted Perelman's concern that academic literary criticism marginalizes poetry in its \\"practices of theorising and curating literature\\". Perelman responded to the issue of whether he was somehow compromised by his move into an academic environment, when he wrote: > Where did our passion for poetry come from? The page? Created by purely > visual epiphany in a kind of unpedagogic, virgin birth? I am very very far > from being in love with normative, gatekeeping academic criticism; but > pedagogy, repetition and circulation are very widespread structuring > conditions against which to act‚Äîboth as writer and as imaginer of receivers. > We all started somewhere well behind the starting line.

Working in concert with collectors including Douglas S. Cramer, Eli Broad, and Keith Barish, he developed a reputation for staging museum-quality exhibitions of contemporary art. Early life and education Gagosian was born April 19, 1945, in Los Angeles, California, the elder sibling and only son to Armenian parents. His mother, Ann Louise, had a career in acting and singing, and his father, Ara, was an accountant and later a stockbroker. His grandparents (original last name Ghoughasian) immigrated from the Ottoman Empire; he and his parents were born in California.Jackie Wullschlager (October 22, 2010), Lunch with the FT: Larry Gagosian Financial Times. Between 1963 and 1969, he pursued a major in English literature at UCLA and graduated in 1969. He worked briefly in a record store, a bookstore, a supermarket, and in an entry-level job as Michael Ovitz‚Äôs secretaryEric Konigsberg (January 28, 2013), The Trials of Art Superdealer Larry Gagosian New York Magazine'. at the William Morris Agency, but got his start in the art business by selling posters near the campus of UCLA in Los Angeles. He closed his poster shop around 1976, when a former restaurant facility became available in the same complex on Westwood's Broxton Avenue, and upgraded to prints by artists like Diane Arbus and Lee Friedlander. His gallery Prints on Broxton was renamed the Broxton Gallery when he began to show a wider array of contemporary art. The gallery worked with up-and-coming artists such as Vija Celmins, Alexis Smith, and Elyn Zimmerman, and staged exhibitions such as \\"Broxton Sequences: Sequential Imagery in Photography\\", which included the work of John Baldessari and Bruce Nauman.Broxton Gallery Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center. Television executive Barry Lowen introduced Gagosian to Douglas S. Cramer, who introduced him to his ex-wife, Joyce Haber, who sold him her California art, which he promptly and profitably resold.  Career  In 1978, he opened his first gallery, on La Brea Avenue in West Hollywood, and began showing young Californians (Vija Celmins, Chris Burden) and new New Yorkers (Eric Fischl, Cindy Sherman, Jean-Michel Basquiat). That same year, he bought a loft in New York on West Broadway opposite the Leo Castelli Gallery. It was Castelli who introduced Gagosian to Charles Saatchi and Samuel Newhouse Jr.Bob Colacello (April 1995), The Art of the Deal Vanity Fair. In his first New York appearance, in 1979, he presented David Salle's first exhibition in a loft at 421 West Broadway,Matt Chaban and Sarah Douglas (August 23, 2011), Larry Gagosian‚Äôs Real Estate Wheelings and Dealings New York Observer. in collaboration with dealer Annina Nosei. In 1982, Nosei and Gagosian staged an exhibition of Jean-Michel Basquiat in Los Angeles.Rob Sharp (November 2, 2007), Larry Gagosian: The fine art of the deal The Independent. Around that time, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Gagosian had built below his Venice home on Market Street.Fred Hoffman (March 13, 2005), Basquiat's L.A. - How an '80s interlude became a catalyst for an artist's evolution Los Angeles Times. In the early 1980s, Gagosian developed his business rapidly by exploiting the possibilities of reselling works of art by blue-chip modern and contemporary artists, earning the nickname \\"Go-Go\\" in the process. After establishing a Manhattan gallery in the mid-1980s, located at the ground-floor space in artist Sandro Chia‚Äôs studio building at 521 West 23rd Street, Gagosian began to work with a stable of super collectors including David Geffen, Newhouse, Saatchi, and David Ganek. Bidding on behalf of Newhouse in 1988, Gagosian paid over $17 million for False Start (1959) by Jasper Johns, a then-record price for a work by a living artist. That record was beaten in 2008, when Gagosian paid $23.5 million at Sotheby's in November 2007 for Jeff Koons's Hanging Heart (an artist who happens to belong to the Gagosian gallery's stable). In 1988, Gagosian bought the Toad Hall estate in Amagansett, New York, with an 11,000-square-foot houseTaylor K.

In 2009, he had Christian Liaigre design a home for him in Flamands Beach on St. Barths. In 2010, internet pioneer David Bohnett sold his 5,700 square feet Holmby Hills compound, originally designed by A. Quincy Jones for Gary Cooper, to Gagosian for $15.5 million, according to public records.Lauren Beale (August 24, 2010), David Bohnett sells Holmby Hills estate Los Angeles Times.

Recognition In 2011, the British magazine ArtReview placed Gagosian fourth in their annual poll of \\"most powerful person in the art world\\". Legal issues In 2003, Gagosian paid $4 million settlement after federal prosecutors accused him and three partners of failing to pay taxes on the sale of 58 works of art. In 2012, suits and counter-suits were filed by Gagosian and Ronald Perelman against one another concerning an unfinished work by Jeff Koons and 10 others worth up to $45 million. In 2012, Gagosian was sued for $14 million in a suit involving the sale of an edition of Girl in Mirror.

The museum is open to the public on a seasonal schedule, but volunteer activities relating to the preservation of historic transit are year-round. History The museum was founded in 1955 in Brooklyn to save some of the last trolley cars still in New York City. During the early years of the museum's existence, it had no permanent home. The growing collection of trolley and subway cars were stored in various locations, such as Staten Island and northern New Jersey. On a few occasions until the city took down the last of the overhead wire in the early 1960s, the museum operated a Swedish trolley car on McDonald Avenue, Brooklyn. The museum also held movie nights for members in a Peter Witt streetcar at St. George, Staten Island. The railroad yard at Rondout. In 1983 the museum finally found a permanent home in Kingston, occupying the abandoned Rondout shops area, MP 1, of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad (U&D;). As a condition of the museum's charter with the city of Kingston, the museum had to immediately begin public operations. At the time, everything in the museum collection was electric powered and the U&D; tracks were not equipped for electric operation. The museum acquired a Doodlebug (a former Sperry Rail Service car) from Connecticut and began public operation on July 4, 1983. At first, less than a mile of track was usable, but within two years the run was extended to Kingston Point to provide scenic views of the Hudson River. In 2000 the museum began operating a trolley from Johnstown, Pennsylvania after a nine-year restoration. The museum leases the yard and about 1.5 miles of right of way and track from the City of Kingston. This includes the former U&D; main line from Kingston Point, MP 0, to about MP 1.1, plus a spur track that runs from the yard along Ferry Street to T. R. Gallo Park at Rondout Landing. The Museum operates on a seasonal schedule on weekends and holidays. Collection Notable items in the collection: * Brill No. 120. One of two former Sperry Rail Service Model 55 Brill cars, also ex.

The trail ascends Mount Le Conte, one of the tallest (sixth highest) mountains east of the Mississippi River and passes both Grotto Falls and Trillium Gap before reaching the LeConte Lodge, near the summit. The trail to Grotto Falls is one of the busiest in the national park. Vital information * The Trillium Gap Trail is one of the five trails leading to the Le Conte massif, which contains four separate peaks in all, the highest of which has an elevation of . * The trail is the only horse trail on Le Conte and is traveled three times a week by llamas transporting supplies to the LeConte Lodge, except during the winter season, when the lodge is temporarily closed. * The trailhead is located inside of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, about from the town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, off the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail. Landmarks/overlooks Llamas are used to resupply LeConte Lodge. The Trillium Gap Trail is the main route used. Grotto Falls * Roaring Fork * Grotto Falls * Trillium Gap * Brushy Mountain (0.4 mile spur trail from Trillium Gap) Trail synopsis Trailhead to Grotto Falls The Trillium Gap Trail begins its journey up the northern face of Mount Le Conte in an old- growth Eastern Hemlock grove, at an elevation close to 3,200 ft (975 m). Although very easy (only rising in elevation over the first 1.5 miles), this portion of the trail does contain many small creek crossings, so the hiker may want to brush up on his/her rock hopping skills prior to taking on the trail. After the third small stream, Roaring Fork sidles up along the path, signalling the soon-approaching Grotto Falls at . Here Roaring Fork tumbles thirty feet (9 m) over the falls, which the trail actually passes behind on its way to Trillium Gap and points beyond. Grotto Falls is one of the most picturesque waterfalls in the park, and inasmuch can draw quite the crowd on certain days. Grotto Falls to Trillium Gap Grotto Falls, from above Once the hiker crosses the sometimes treacherous Roaring Fork (particularly after heavy rains), s/he begins a more steady ascent towards Le Conte. The trail here becomes more narrow and progressively rockier, a combination of the gain in elevation and loss of heavy activity along the trail. About a mile past the falls, the path enters into an expansive boulder field, where yet another small creek plummets down towards Roaring Fork. At the trail comes to Trillium Gap, tucked snugly between the peaks of Le Conte and nearby Brushy Mountain. Springtime hikers will be delighted by the brilliant carpetting of wildflowers underneath the American beech grove that dominates the area. The Brushy Mountain Trail extends to the left of the gap, which, if taken less than a half mile, offers excellent views of Le Conte and even the towns of Pigeon Forge and Sevierville from Brushy Mountain. Trillium Gap to the LeConte Lodge After leaving Trillium Gap, the trail continues climbing for towards its terminus. Along the way the hiker passes through a heath bald, similar to that found on Brushy Mountain, which is created in exposed, high elevation, areas where the soil is thin and heath family plants dominate. About a mile past the heath bald, the trail enters the fraser and spruce fir zone prevalent in the higher peaks of the Smokies. Fantastic views of the towns of Sevier County are available here when weather permits, sometimes even extending to the outskirts of Knoxville, as the hiker closes in on the LeConte Lodge. The LeConte Lodge provides the only commercial lodging in the national park, as it operates about 10 rustic cabins with no electricity or appliances. The Lodge also operates an office which provides t-shirts and other merchandise for hikers and various amenities for guests of the lodge. For many, this signals the end of their journey, but the actual peaks of Le Conte all have separate trails a short distance from the lodge, with Cliff Tops and Myrtle Point each offering expansive panoramas of the mountains and valleys below.

It was spun off into its own company in 1989, after the two railroads split. Catellus created contemporary developments throughout California, including the East Bay Bridge shopping center and Bridgecourt apartment complex in Emeryville in the San Francisco Bay Area. Catellus was also a proponent of the Emery Go-Round tram network. History In 1984, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Southern Pacific Lines announced plans to merge all their assets into a single railway. As part of the merger, Santa Fe Pacific Realty, the real estate arm, was incorporated after the announcement. In 1986, the Interstate Commerce Commission denied the merger, as it would have created a monopoly on mainline freight movements in California and its bordering states. As a result, the two railroads split in 1988. The real estate arm was spun off in 1989 and was renamed Catellus Development Corporation to manage the stations and land parcels next to the railroad tracks remaining under their ownership. It would later come to own numerous properties across the continent. On June 7, 2005, Catellus Development Corporation announced it will merge into ProLogis (NYSE: PLD) for $3.6 billion ($5.5 billion in 2018 dollars). The deal closed on September 15, 2005. In late 2010, The private equity firm TPG Capital announced its intent to acquire a collection of real estate and the Catellus trademark from ProLogis. The deal closed in 2011. Today, the developer operates with headquarters in Oakland, California, with regional offices elsewhere. Notable assets In California The company owned Los Angeles Union Station; they sold it on April 14, 2011, to Metro. Catellus previously held an entitlement from the city council for developing sites surrounding the station until 2022, which included the station's restoration and seismic upgrades, in addition to constructing the MTA Building. The entitlement expired with the sale to Metro. It remains the owner of the Santa Fe Depot in San Diego, and has created the Santa Fe Place transit oriented development on parcels surrounding it. The Grande twin towers are part of that project. In the San Francisco Bay Area, it currently owns the Pacific Commons retail center in Fremont.

Early life AlHaj was born in Baghdad, Iraq and began playing the oud (an Arabic lute) at age nine. Early on, it was evident that he had a remarkable talent for playing the oud. Education AlHaj studied under the renowned Munir Bashir, considered by many to be the greatest oud player ever, and Salim Abdul Kareem, at the Institute of Music in Baghdad, Iraq. AlHaj won various awards at the conservatory and graduated in 1990 with a diploma in composition. He also holds a degree in Arabic literature from Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. Emigration In 1991, after the first Gulf War, AlHaj was forced to leave Iraq due to his political activism against the Saddam Hussein regime and began his life in Jordan and Syria. He moved to the U.S. in 2000 as a political refugee and has resided in Albuquerque, New Mexico, ever since. He became a U.S. citizen on August 16, 2008. Career AlHaj has performed all over the world, on tour with Munir Bashir, his teacher, as well as solo and with his string quartet project, including numerous concerts in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, and France and hundreds of concerts in the United States. AlHaj has released several recordings. The Second Baghdad, released in 2002, and Iraqi Music in a Time of War, released in 2003, were both produced by VoxLox record label. His East meets West CD entitled Friendship (Rahim AlHaj, Oud & Sadaqa Quartet) was released in December 2005 by Fast Horse Recordings. His When the Soul is Settled: Music of Iraq, produced by Smithsonian Folkways, was released in June 2006, and nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award. An oud and sarod CD with Amjad Ali Khan will be released later in the year. AlHaj's music delicately combines traditional Iraqi maqams with contemporary styling and influence. His compositions are about the experience of exile from his homeland and of new beginnings in his adopted country. He is one of the true oud masters from Iraq. AlHaj says that \\"my music invites the listener to discover the true spirit of the musician.\\" His compositions are about loss, hope, freedom, and longing. His songs establish new concepts without altering the foundation of the traditional Iraqi School of oud based in Baghdad.

The route, in length, is located in a rural section of the town of Brunswick. It climbs uphill from a southern terminus at NY 2 in the hamlet of Clums Corners to its northern end at NY 7\\\\. The road was taken over by the state of New York in 1905 and designated NY 278 .  Route description  NY 278 approaching the junction with NY 7 in Brunswick Center NY 278 begins at an intersection with NY 2 in the hamlet of Clums Corners, located within a valley in eastern Brunswick. The highway progresses northwestward, intersecting with County Route 129 (CR 129, Tamarac Road) before ascending in elevation and continuing out of Clums Corners as Brick Church Road. NY 278 passes some farms and buildings as it traverses several small hills and intersects with the northern terminus of CR 133 (Moonlawn Road). The route descends slightly from here, passing some more farms and the namesake brick church before terminating at an intersection with NY 7 (Hoosick Street) northeast of Brunswick Center.

While oksusu-suyeom- cha () or corn silk tea refers to the tea made from corn silk, oksusu-cha can be made from corn kernels, corn silk, or a combination of both. The caffeine- free infusion is a popular hot drink in winter. Along with bori-cha (barley tea), oksusu-cha is one of the free grain teas served in many restaurants in place of water. In Gangwon Province, the tea is called gangnaengi-cha ()‚Äîgangnaengi is a Gangwon dialect for \\"corn\\"‚Äîand is consumed throughout late autumn and winter in most households.  Preparation  Traditionally, corn kernels are dried and roasted to prepare oksusu-cha. The roasted corn kernels are then boiled in water until the tea turns yellow. The tea is then strained and the boiled corn discarded. Although the drink is naturally sweet, sugar is sometimes added when a sweeter flavor is desired. Roasted corn kernels are available at groceries, traditional markets and supermarkets in Korea, as well as at Korean groceries abroad. Tea bags containing ground corn are also commercially available.  Blends  Oksusu-cha is often combined with bori- cha (barley tea), as the corn's sweetness offsets the slightly bitter flavor of the barley.

It was first published in 2000 by Simon & Schuster in the UK followed by Crown Books in the US.www.isfdb.org Retrieved 2019-08-27. The book is a retelling of the Arthurian legend and follows the lives of Queen Guinevere, consort of King Arthur and her struggles with the king's nephews Agravain and Gawain; the queen is torn between her love for her husband, her land, and her lover, Lancelot. The book was part of a series, The Guinevere Novels, and was followed by The Child of the Holy Grail. Reviewing the book, Publishers Weekly described it as \\"a lush, feminist take on the English epic\\". Plot introduction The Knight of the Sacred Lake is a variant of an Arthurian legend. It follows the lives of Queen Guinevere, or Guenevere, and her strife with Agravain and Gawain, as well as that of her lover's, Lancelot, as they both enter different paths in their lives, away from each other. Plot summary As High King and Queen, Arthur and Guenevere reign supreme across the many kingdoms of Great Britain. Still, Guenevere secretly mourns the loss of her beloved Lancelot, who has returned to the Sacred Lake of his boyhood, hoping to restore his faith in chivalry in the place where he learned to be a knight. In a glittering Pentecost ceremony, new knights are sworn to the Round Table, including Arthur's nephews, Agravain and Gawain. After many years of strife, peace is restored to Guenevere's realm. But betrayal, jealousy, and ancient blood feuds fester unseen. Morgan le Fay, now the mother of Arthur's only son, Mordred, has become the focus of Merlin's age-old quest to ensure the survival of the house of Pendragon. From the east comes the shattering news that Guenevere may have a rival for Lancelot's love. A bleak shadow falls again across Camelot‚Äîand across the sacred isle of Avalon, where Roman priests threaten the life of the Lady herself. At the center of the storm is Guenevere, torn between her love for her husband, her people, and Sir Lancelot of the Lake.

After guitarist Michael Schenker joined in 1973, they signed to Chrysalis Records, and changed their musical style from space rock to hard rock and heavy metal, but found only modest commercial success. However, UFO are often cited as one of the key influences on the hard rock and heavy metal scenes of the 1980s and 1990s, including bands such as Metallica, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard, Slayer, Megadeth, Testament, Overkill, Anthrax, Alice in Chains, Tesla and Dio. Mogg wrote the majority of UFO's lyrics, with the music being written by Way, Schenker, and later, Paul Raymond, although Schenker left the band in 1978 to launch his solo band. Mogg is the only member of UFO to appear on all of the band's albums and remains their only permanent member. In 1997, during UFO's hiatus, Mogg and Way, under the moniker Mogg/Way, released a couple of albums, Edge of the World and Chocolate Box. In 2002, he was in a side project, $ign of 4, featuring Cosmosquad members Shane Gaalaas on drums and Jeff Kollman on guitar, respectively. Kollman had earlier been the guitarist and co-writer on Mogg/Way's Chocolate Box. In late 2003, having regained the rights to the UFO name from Schenker, Mogg spoke with Pete Way and Paul Raymond, and ended up having a reunion tour which later brought the band back for good, with newly hired American guitarist Vinnie Moore. UFO have since released six more albums, the latest being the 2017 covers album The Salentino Cuts. UFO announced their \\"Last Orders: 50th Anniversary\\" farewell tour in 2019. The band is touring the United Kingdom from March to April, Europe from June to August, and finally the United States from October to November. The final gig is the rock legends cruise which is a five-day event in early 2020. Mogg has confirmed he is retiring after the tour as a member of UFO, but has not ruled out other musical ventures in the future. Personal life Phil Mogg was a junior boxing champion in North London before his music career. He is married to Emma Mogg, a former page three girl since 2006 and currently resides in Brighton, East Sussex, England. He is the uncle of Nigel Mogg, former bassist of The Quireboys.Larkin, Colin (2011) The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Omnibus Press, p. 2260 Discography UFO Studio * UFO 1 (1970) Uncharted * Flying (1971) Uncharted * Phenomenon (1974) Uncharted * Force It (1975) Chart Position 71 (US) * No Heavy Petting (1976) Chart Position 167 (US) * Lights Out (1977) Chart Position 51 (UK), 23 (US) * Obsession (1978) Chart Position 26 (UK), 41 (US) * No Place to Run (1980) Chart Position 11 (UK), 51 (US) * The Wild, The Willing And The Innocent (1981) Chart Position 19 (UK), 77 (US) * Mechanix (1982) Chart Position 8 (UK), 82 (US) * Making Contact (1983) Chart Position 32 (UK), 153 (US) * Misdemeanor (1985) Chart Position 74 (UK), 106 (US) * Ain't Misbehavin' (EP) (1988) Uncharted * High Stakes & Dangerous Men (1992) Uncharted * Walk On Water (1995) Uncharted * Covenant (2000) Uncharted * Sharks (2002) Uncharted * You Are Here (2004) Uncharted * The Monkey Puzzle (2006) * The Visitor (2009) * Seven Deadly (2012) * A Conspiracy of Stars (2015) * The Salentino Cuts (2017) Live * Live (1972) Uncharted * Live In Concert (1974) * Strangers In The Night (1979) Chart Position 42 (US), 8 (UK) * Lights Out In Tokyo (1992) * Live In Japan (1992) * T.N.T.

American patriotic music is a part of the culture and history of the United States since its founding in the 18th century and has served to encourage feelings of honor for the country's forefathers and for national unity. These songs include hymns, military themes, national songs, and music from stage and screen, as well as songs adapted from poems. \\"Patriotic melodies,\\" Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress. Retrieved August 5, 2008 Much of American patriotic music owes its origins to six main wars‚Äîthe American Revolution, the American Indian Wars, the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During the period prior to American independence, much of America's patriotic music was aligned with the political ambitions of the British in the new land and so several songs are tied with the country's British origin. Colonial era \\"The Liberty Song\\", written by Founding Father John Dickinson in 1768 to the music of William Boyce's \\"Heart of Oak\\", is perhaps the first patriotic song written in America. The song contains the line \\"by uniting we stand, by dividing we fall\\", which was an overture to the feelings of common blood and origin the Americans had whilst fighting the French and Indian War, and is also the first recorded use of the sentiment. Additionally, other songs gained prominence in keeping with British and American unity namely \\"The British Grenadiers,\\" and \\"God Save the King\\". However, with the War of Independence the tunes of the last two were combined with new words while \\"Yankee Doodle\\", long a tune and lyric addressed to the unique American population descended from the British became widely popular. Political and cultural links between the colony and Great Britain can perhaps explain the ongoing popularity of the two former tunes, despite the war for independence. Nineteenth century In 1814, Washington lawyer Francis Scott Key wrote a poem, \\"Defence of Fort McHenry,\\" after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. Once again, owing to the origin of America from British nationals, the lyrics were later set to music common to British and American sailors, but eventually became world-famous as \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" and was designated the United States' official national anthem in 1931. After centuries of struggling and fighting hostile Native Americans, diseases, and nature, Americans had breached the Appalachian mountain chain and pushed into the wide open areas of the far west. Thus, songs such as \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee,\\" composed in 1831, have as themes natural wonder combined with freedom and liberty. Others, such as \\"America the Beautiful,\\" express appreciation for the natural beauty of the United States and the hope for a better nation, wrote one hymn editor. However, in contrast to \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\" and the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\", the \\"America the Beautiful\\" does not have the triumphalism found in many patriotic American songs. It was originally a poem composed by Katharine Lee Bates after she had experienced the view from Pikes Peak of fertile ground as far as the eye could see, and was sung to a variety of tunes until the present one, written as a hymn tune in 1882 by Samuel Ward, became associated with it. \\"America the beautiful,\\" Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress. Retrieved August 5, 2008 During the events leading up to the American Civil War, both the North and the South generated a number of songs to stir up patriotic sentiments such as \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\", and \\"Dixie\\". However, after the Civil War, the sentiments of most patriotic songs were geared to rebuilding and consolidating the United States. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the 1890s, songwriters continued to write patriotic tunes that honored America's soldiers and rallied citizens in support of the war. Songs such as \\"Brave Dewey and His Men\\" and \\"The Charge of the Roosevelt Riders\\" lauded Commodore George Dewey and Theodore Roosevelt. Around this time, John Philip Sousa began composing many of his famous patriotic marches, including \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" and \\"The Washington Post March.\\" Songs such as \\"The Black KPs\\", likely labelled racist and offensive by modern listeners, were intended to rally the public behind the war effort. Twentieth and twenty-first centuries World War I produced patriotic American songs such as \\"Over There\\" by popular songwriter George M. Cohan. Cohan composed the song April 6, 1917, when he saw headlines announcing the U.S. had entered World War I. \\"Over there,\\" Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress. Retrieved August 5, 2008 Cohan also is famous for penning \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy,\\" an over-the-top parody of patriotic music. A 1918 Irving Berlin composition, \\"God Bless America\\", is sometimes considered an unofficial national anthem of the United States and is often performed at sporting events alongside (or, in some rare cases, such as Ronan Tynan, in place of) \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" In 1940, Woody Guthrie wrote \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" in response to his dislike of \\"God Bless America\\", calling it unrealistic and complacent. The World War II era produced a significant number of patriotic songs in the Big Band and Swing format.

The bridge is notable for its complex design that was required to accommodate river traffic, the St. Paul Union Pacific Vertical-lift Rail Bridge crossing underneath it at an angle, and roadways on the downtown side of St. Paul. The bridge is also notable for a monumental reinforced concrete rainbow arch. The rainbow arch not only provides 62 feet of headroom above the river, but also provides a strong aesthetic focus. It was built in 1924‚Äì1926 by Fegles Construction Company, Ltd. and designed by Toltz, King & Day. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The bridge as well as Robert Street itself are named after Captain Louis Roberts, a notable French Canadian river boat captain, businessman and early settler of Saint Paul, MN. The bridge was commissioned in the early 1920s to replace a wrought- iron span, originally built in 1884-1885, that had become obsolete due to increasing traffic. The engineers who designed the bridge had several obstacles to work around. The tracks of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, St. Paul Union Depot, and the Chicago Great Western Railway mainline were factors. The engineers also had to provide adequate clearance above the river, as defined by the United States War Department at the time. Finally, the bridge had to clear Second Street in downtown St. Paul and work through a busy manufacturing district at the south end. The location of nearly every pier was dictated by these requirements. As a result, the bridge was designed with a combination of barrel-arch and rib-arch flanking spans and a rainbow arch for the central span. One of the members of the crew building the bridge was Warren Burger, future Chief Justice of the United States.

He was later a member of The Saints, and worked with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. As a member of the Birthday Party, Pew became associated with their \\"prodigious consumption of drugs and alcohol\\". In 1982, he was imprisoned for ten weeks in HM Prison Won Wron on charges relating to driving under the influence of alcohol. He died on 7 November 1986 of a brain haemorrhage, after sustaining head injuries during an epileptic seizure; he was aged 28. Biography Tracy Franklin Pew was born on 19 December 1957 in Australia; he moved with his family to New Zealand in 1959, but they returned in May 1964. From 1972, he attended Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne. He lived in Mount Waverley and learned to play bass from his friend, Chris Walsh. Pew joined a rock band, The Boys Next Door, in 1975; it included his schoolfriends Nick Cave on vocals, Mick Harvey on guitar and Phill Calvert on drums. In May 1978, they provided three tracks for the Suicide Records compilation by various artists, Lethal Weapons, including two tracks each by Teenage Radio Stars and JAB. The Boys Next Door added Rowland S. Howard on guitar in December 1978; in April 1979, they issued their debut album Door, Door on Mushroom Records. In October that year they released a shared single, \\"Scatterbrain\\", backed with \\"Early Morning Brain (It's Not Quite the Same as Sobriety)\\" by alternative rockers Models. The Boys Next Door and Models were \\"the first Melbourne bands to rise out of the ashes of that city's hothouse punk/new wave explosion of the late 1970s with a clear vision and wider appeal. While The Birthday Party was hell-bent on kicking down the established parameters of rock music, Models were more clearly pop-oriented\\". In February 1980, The Boys Next Door renamed themselves The Birthday Party and relocated to London. Rowland S. Howard recalls, \\"About the time of Hee Haw we decided to move to London ... we got very little press and our audience had reached a plateau. There was nowhere we could go. So we figured we had to go somewhere that, by virtue of population, there was more people that would be interested in seeing a band that was not a commercial proposition.\\" In November that year they returned to Australia, released their debut album Prayers on Fire in April 1981, and were back in London by August. Pew wrote a track, \\"The Plague\\", for Prayers on Fire, but it did not make the cut; it later appeared on Drunk on the Pope's Blood (1991). The Birthday Party returned to the Crystal Ballroom. Ashley Crawford recalls \\"the only one who looked part of a more-or-less traditional rock'n'roll band was Tracy Pew, inevitably resplendent in fishnet singlet and ten-gallon Stetson, wielding a bass guitar like an AK47 and known to occasionally stuff his head into the centre of the bass drum as he flailed at his bass guitar\\". On 16 February 1982, Pew was imprisoned on charges relating to driving under the influence of alcohol and a series of accumulated fines; he was sentenced to ten weeks in HM Prison Won Wron, a minimum security prison farm near Yarram. In Rowland S. Howard's words, \\"I'd been in quite a few trips with Tracy where somewhere along the journey you'd find out the car was stolen. I remember we were driving around Melbourne and there were all these kids' pictures floating around in the back seat. He'd stolen some poor primary school teacher's car.\\" During Pew's stretch at Won Wron, he was temporarily replaced in the band by Chris Walsh (of The Moodists) for the band's subsequent Melbourne shows, and Barry Adamson (of Magazine) and Harry Howard (Rowland's brother) for their UK shows. Pew returned to the band after his release with a gig in Hammersmith on 26 May 1982. In August the group relocated to Berlin. According to rock music historian Ian McFarlane, \\"Rivalries within the group had intensified, and the prodigious consumption of drugs and alcohol by various members began to undermine any sense of unity. Matters came to a head when Harvey refused to undertake a tour of Australia at the end of May 1983\\". Gerald Houghton found the group \\"was a jolly adventure in drugs, alcohol, and more drugs and even more alcohol. Here if you want them are the king-size fuck-ups of guitarist Roland S. Howard, Cave and particularly leather-trousered bassist Tracy Pew. Stories are rampant about the congenial, erudite Pew's excesses, of OD-ing offstage and collapsing on\\". Rowland S. Howard recalls, \\"We'd spent the last 4 years not really making any money, living in each others' pockets, homeless. We just need to take a ... breath!\\" The Birthday Party played their last gig on 9 June 1983, although early in 1984 Pew briefly played bass for Nick Cave ‚Äì Man or Myth?, the forerunner of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, on a live tour. Pew returned to Melbourne to study literature and philosophy at Monash University. In mid-1984, singer-songwriter Chris Bailey asked Pew to join a touring line-up of his punk band The Saints, alongside Chris Burnham on guitar and Ian Shedden on drums. Former Saints' member Ed Kuepper agreed to return and toured with the band, replacing Pew on bass, but left after several weeks due to old conflicts resurfacing. Pew contributed to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' album of cover versions, Kicking Against the Pricks (August 1986), and performed on Lydia Lunch's concept album Honeymoon in Red (1987). During his musical career, Pew was credited with playing bass guitar, double bass, wind, and clarinet. He received songwriting credits for \\"She's Hit\\" on Junkyard (May 1982), \\"Sonny's Burning\\" on The Bad Seed (October 1982) and \\"Swampland\\" on Mutiny (1983). Note: For other titles select 'Search again' and enter song titles as: Sonnys Burning or Swampland. Personal life According to Gina Riley, comedian from TV series Kath & Kim, Pew dated her in 1976. In April 2009, Riley recalled the relationship on the musical quiz show Spicks and Specks. Pew was prone to epileptic seizures, at times exacerbated by heavy drug use, although he had cleaned up by the mid-1980s. In late 1986, he experienced a fit while lying in his bathtub, resulting in head injuries so severe he died days later, on 7 November 1986, from a brain haemorrhage. He was 28 years old.

In 6th-century India, religious tales called s were performed by traveling storytellers who carried banners painted with images of gods from house to house.

Some shows had a peep show element to them, where a viewer could pay extra to peer through a hole and see a supposed artifact from the story. Picture stories in Europe and the Middle East Depiction of a Dutch ' (\\"song-singer\\") and his ' from the 17th or 18th century A B√§nkelsenger in Germany In 16th-century Italy, prayers would often be sung in the presence of illuminated scrolls while secular society produced the ' or \\"singing bench\\" where a person would stand on a bench point to pictures with a stick. In Spain up to the 19th century there were blind men with a young \\"helper\\" who would make a living by going from town to town where they would display illustrations and the blind man would recite/sing the story, often about truculent crimes, while his helper pointed at the illustration relevant at that point. These were called \\"\\" (blind man stories). The singing bench migrated northward to Central and Northern Europe where it served as sensationalist quasi-news about murder, fires, death, affairs, sex scandals and the like. Performers of such controversial bench songs were seen as vagrants and troublemakers and were often arrested, exiled, or ostracised for their activities.

She divided her time between homes in Manhattan, Sandisfield, Massachusetts, and Domr√©my-la- Pucelle, France, the birthplace of Joan of Arc. For the stage, she designed the costumes for George Balanchine's production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, among others.  Early life  Barbara Karinska was born Varvara Andreevna Jmoudsky () in Kharkiv, now Ukraine, the Russian Empire, in 1886, to a successful textile manufacturer. She was the third and eldest female of the ten Jmoudsky siblings. Ukrainian embroidery was an art form filled with detailed shades and colors of varying texture of stitches ‚Äì some tiny and fine and others broad and rough. This was Karinska's artistic medium as a child. She studied law at the University of Kharkov and, in 1908, married Alexander Mo√Øssenko, the son of another wealthy Kharkov industrialist. Mo√Øssenko died in 1909 several months before the birth of their daughter Irina. In 1910, Varvara's older brother Anatoly, owner of the moderately Socialist Kharkiv newspaper UTRO (Morning), went through divorce proceedings that resulted in Varvara winning custody of his two-year-old son, Vladimir Anatolevich Jmoudsky. Vladimir and Irina were raised as brother and sister. Varvara soon remarried a prominent lawyer, N. S. Karinsky (1873‚Äì1948), who, being from Moscow, was residing in Kharkov. With his law practice burgeoning, the Karinsky family of four moved to Moscow in 1916, to a spacious apartment that Varvara had purchased. Karinsky continued to practice criminal and political law and gained fame and prestige throughout the Russian Empire. Varvara, meanwhile, became totally engrossed in the arts and hosted her famous salon every night after the theater or ballet. She developed her own form of painting applying pieces of colored silk gauze to photographs and drawings. Her first subjects were ballet scenes. After much tearing apart and redoing, she exhibited about 12 of her works in a prominent Moscow gallery and was quite successful both financially and critically. Czar Nicholas II abdicated in March 1917, to the provisional government, first headed by Prince Lvov and then by Alexander Kerensky. N.S. Karinsky was appointed by Lvov as Attorney General and Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals of the District of St. Petersburg. As Civil War followed the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, The Ministry of the Interior of the White Occupied Southern Territories assigned to N.S. Karinsky the governorship of several southern provinces. Varvara, Irina and Vladimir spent the years of the civil war moving between Kharkov and Crimea; Karinsky joining them where and whenever possible. With the fall of Crimea to the Red forces, in 1920, Karinsky was a marked man, yet he stayed at his post until the very end helping others to escape. Unable to find his family, several of Varvara's sisters and brothers forced him to leave Crimea with them by ship, assuring him that Varvara would soon follow. But Varvara had decided to remain in the \\"New Russia\\" and filed a ‚Äúpostcard divorce‚Äù, legitimate and popular during those years of upheaval. In 1923 N. S. Karinsky eventually made his way to New York where, unable to speak English, he undertook a variety of menial jobs, including driving a taxi. Nicholas Karinsky never lost his good nature or optimistic philosophy of life. He continued his intellectual pursuits editing for the Russian American press and authored a number of articles and monographs; most notably a history of aviation in pre-revolutionary Russia. When Varvara arrived to New York in 1939, she and Nicholas Karinsky had many friends in common, yet it appears that neither ever sought the other's company. Meanwhile, in 1921, Varvara made her way back to Moscow where she met and married Vladimir Mamontov, son of one of Moscow's wealthiest pre-revolutionary industrialists. Having lost everything, Mamontov remained with nothing except his charm, beautiful piano playing and the delusion that someday his late father's fortune would be returned to him. Lenin‚Äôs New Economic Policy (1921‚Äì1928) provided for limited capitalism to help finance his new regime exhausted and debilitated by three years of civil war. Karinska went way beyond Lenin‚Äôs limits. She opened a Tea Salon that became the meeting place of Moscow artists, intellectuals and government officials every afternoon at five o‚Äôclock. In the same complex she founded an haute-couture and a millinery atelier to dress the wives of the Soviet elite. She opened an antique store and an embroidery school where she taught the needle arts to the proletariat. Karinska‚Äôs reasons for leaving Russia are multifold. First there was the death of Lenin in 1924 and the uncertainty of what was to come; secondly, within weeks after Lenin‚Äôs death the new regime nationalized her embroidery school and turned it into a factory to manufacture Soviet flags (In exchange, she was awarded the title of ‚ÄúInspector of Fine Arts‚Äù); thirdly and primarily, Mamontov, a chronic alcoholic and incapable of performing any kind of work was a symbol of bourgeois decadence and his arrest was imminent. Karinska devised a plan to save Mamontov. Supported by Anatoly Lunacharsky, Minister of Education and long time friend of her father, she proposed to take a large number of embroideries made by her students to exhibit in Western European cities as a ‚Äúgood will‚Äù gesture to demonstrate the great cultural advances that the young Soviet regime was making. The proposition was enthusiastically accepted across the high ranks, although Lunacharsky and others knew quite well what she was up to. With corruption widely practiced throughout the Soviet government, an exit visa was obtained for Mamontov who left immediately for Germany where he had cousins in exile. A few weeks later Karinska, Irina and Vladimir left together from Moscow station on a Berlin-bound train. Irina boarded the train whimpering under the weight of a huge chapeau. ‚ÄúStop whining!‚Äù her mother would scold. Later the girl of 14 learned that the hat was filled with diamonds. Vladimir boarded the train with a suitcase filled with his Soviet school books, American hundred dollar bills, bought on the black market, hidden between the pages. Karinska boarded the train waving and blowing kisses to the crowd that came to bid her bon voyage. But the crates with her student's embroideries framed under glass had, hidden underneath each, antique embroideries sewn by the ladies-in-waiting to the Russian Empresses of the past centuries. Reuniting with Vladimir Mamontov in Berlin, the family of four headed for Brussels where Karinska's father and several brothers and sisters were living. But Brussels was too quiet for Karinska and after a few months they moved to Paris.  Life in Paris  Coppelia (act 2), Coppelia (act 1), and Giselle (act 2). Displayed at Beit Ariela, Tel Aviv-Yafo. After two years of luxurious living in Paris, all the treasures brought from Russia were gone. The family was forced to move to a popular quarter of the city of lights and Karinska looked desperately for any and every kind of work using her skills of sewing and embroidery. With her beauty and aplomb she had no difficulty meeting whoever she wanted to meet. It wasn‚Äôt long before she made her first costume; an elaborately embroidered robe designed by Boris Bilinsky for the 1927 motion picture The Loves of Casanova. More single orders followed and then larger and larger ones. All the time Irina and Vladimir worked with her. A newly formed ballet company, the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, directed by Colonel de Basil and Ren√© Blum requested she make costumes for their first season. The costumes were designed by Christian B√©rard, Andr√© Derain, and Joan Mir√≥, and the choreography was by George Balanchine and Leonide Massine, both choreographers with whom she had worked previously. B√©rard, Derain, and Mir√≥ would provide a general sketch, an idea, but it would be Karinska who expounded upon the concept, modified it, chose the fabric, quality and quantity, and decided how the concept would be implemented. Karinska soon became in Paris, the premiere interpreter of the costume for the ballet and musical theater. During Karinska's brief career in Paris she collaborated with B√®rard, Derain, Mir√≥, Balthus, Cassandre, Soudeikine, and Vert√®s, amongst a long list of painters and designers. She costumed the plays of Jean Cocteau and Louis Jouvet. In 1933, Karinska costumed Les Ballets 1933 (designed by B√®rard, Derain, and Tchelitchev amongst others), Balanchine's six ballets in Paris before he left for New York. Life in London In 1936, and free of Mamontov for several years, a series of circumstances led Karinska to make the decision to leave Paris. Her daughter remained and the business was reopened under the name ‚ÄúIr√®ne Karinska‚Äù. Barbara Karinska and Vladimir, sponsored by Mme. Hayward Court Dressmaker, settled in London. The partnership was short lived and, after a second short-lived partnership with another prestigious London dress firm, Karinska and Vladimir rented the Sir Joshua Reynolds House where they each took an upper floor for their respective flats while the spacious lower floors housed the costume making facilities. The London years were far more prosperous than Paris. They costumed ballet, musical revue, Shakespeare, and cinema while still attending to Louis Jouvet back in Paris. Together with B√©rard, Karinska and Vladimir experimented very successfully with new materials never before used in theater. Here Karinska began her long collaborative relationship with Cecil Beaton. Barbara Karinska in her London Studio, 1939 But war was in the making and early in 1939, Karinska abandoned her London empire, on short notice, and moved permanently to the United States, leaving her nephew to close the business with honor; evacuate Reynolds's House and liquidate his aunt's accumulation of costume sketches and antiques. Ir√®ne came to London immediately to sign all release documents in her mother's place. England and France declared war on Germany in September, 1939, and Vladimir, feeling greater allegiance to France than to England, returned to Paris and enlisted in the French army. Wounded, captured and escaping from a German POW camp, made his way to the South of France where Karinska's sister, Angelina, was living. Angelina, who had just received Karinska's address in New York from Ir√®ne in Paris, by way of the underground, put mother and adopted son in touch once more.

From the Barbara Karinska Collection at Ailina Dance Archives. Balanchine, who had relocated to the United States, had given Karinska an unused room at the fledgling School of American Ballet in New York City for her to work. From this space she collaborated with Salvador Dal√≠ on Venusberg from Tannheuser for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo‚Äîrecently relocated in New York‚Äîin the fall of 1939. Through Dal√≠, Karinska made friends with the Spanish Consul and confided to him her nephew's case. Vladimir received instructions to make his way to the Spanish border where he would be provided safe transit to a ship leaving Lisbon for New York, via Havana. Emaciated and sickly, he arrived to New York in January 1941 where he was smothered by his aunts hugs and kisses. His new apartment awaited him at the mansion that Karinska was renting on E. 56th Street. Karinska at that time was ridding herself of her partners, ‚ÄúThe Princess and the Baron‚Äù, from a fly by night venture in haute-couture. She kept the mansion; the name Karinska Inc. and the parquet floor that the Baron had had brought to New York from a family castle in France. Shortly after Vlady's arrival they began executing the designs of Karinska's arch rival Irene Sharaff for Gypsy Rose Lee. Miss Lee believed that Karinska understood the impact of her performance and enhanced her ability to deliver her unique style of burlesque to the audience. Vladimir hit it off well with Sharaff and made it possible for the two rivals to work together. But rivalry soon ensued between Vladimir and Kermit Love who designed Agnes de Mille‚Äôs Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Vladimir and Love were both makers of masks and hard costumes. But the rivalry was short lived as Vladimir was drafted into the United States Army. Since the German occupation of Paris, Karinska had lost contact with her daughter, Ir√®ne, who was living in Sarthe at the family residence of her husband, Xavier Fran√ßois. It was Vladimir the soldier who found Ir√®ne days before the liberation of Paris and from his nearby barracks wrote to Karinska special delivery informing her that she was a grandmother twice over. Vladimir entered the American Army in 1943 as Private Vladimir Jmoudsky and returned to civilian life in 1945 as Lieutenant Lawrence Vlady. Back to work with Karinska, Vlady brought to the great costumer something she had never known: American military order, discipline and administration. The 56th Street mansion was soon abandoned; Karinska Inc. was liquidated and the Karinska-Vlady enterprise, KARINSKA Stage and Art Inc., made its debut in a rather unsightly loft on W. 44th Street where Karinska‚Äôs costumes, always delivered at the last moment, could be walked over to the theaters if needs be. The affordable rent of the dusty atelier permitted Karinska to purchase a townhouse on E. 63rd St. (where the Baron's parquet floor was installed); a house in Joan of Arc‚Äôs home town, Domr√©my-la-Pucelle, in the Lorraine region of Eastern France, and a George Washington period house that she named \\"Saint Joan Hill\\" in Sandisfield, Massachusetts. During the war years, while Karinska took extensive leaves to supervise costume production for motion pictures in Hollywood, she would rent her 56th St. mansion and her staff to ballet and theater companies, ventures that always ended in misunderstandings. With Vlady permanently settled in New York, he would run the business while Karinska worked in Hollywood. Under this arrangement she won her Oscar for Joan of Arc and her Oscar nomination for Hans Christian Andersen. These were the ‚ÄúGolden Years‚Äù. The label ‚ÄúKARINSKA Stage and Art Inc.‚Äù was sewn into costumes for Ice Shows, Musicals, legitimate theater, motion pictures, lyric opera and the most important for the Lady from Kharkov ‚ÄìBallet. At the end of the German occupation of Paris, Ir√®ne Karinska reopened her costume atelier and worked successfully until retirement in the 1970s. Due to the fact that Ir√®ne's work was often credited as \\"Costumes par Karinska\\", researchers have credited much of her work to her mother. An example of the confusion between mother and daughter was found in a well-intentioned contribution to this very article. It credited costume design of the 1953 French film adaptation of La Dame aux Cam√©lias to Barbara Karinska when, in fact, the costumes were designed by Rosine Delamere and executed by Ir√®ne Karinska. Costumes designed by Raoul Dufy, Georges Braque, Leonor Fini, and Yves St Laurent (for Roland Petit) are the work of Ir√®ne Karinska. Costumes for the 1958 Oscar-winning musical Gigi were designed by Cecil Beaton and executed by Ir√®ne Karinska. Aunt and nephew parted ways in 1964, at which time Karinska was invited by Balanchine to join the New York City Ballet at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, newly injected with generous grants from the Ford Foundation. This period ‚Äìoften praised by critics as Karinska's greatest and condemned by others for ‚Äúgarish‚Äù colors‚Äì, witnessed Balanchine's new \\"Firebird\\", in 1970, which Karinska created from the sketches of Marc Chagall. Karinska and Chagall had been close friends and mutual artistic admirers since Moscow in the 1920s. With the \\"Firebird\\" collaboration, their friendship was rekindled and Karinska would spend several weeks each summer of her final creative years with Madame and Monsieur Chagall at their home in St Paul de Vence, in the south of France. Karinska's final work was Balanchine's 1977 \\"Vienna Waltzes‚Äô\\". Both aging during the 1970s Balanchine and Karinska created a fantasy ballet, \\"Birds of America,\\" based on the drawings of John Jay Audubon. Elaborate beyond possibility, \\"Birds of America\\" was never meant to be materialized; it was a means to keep their attention on life and beauty. Balanchine would spend long sojourns at Karinska's Berkshire home. Karinska would make endless sketches by pasting pieces of fine fabric onto pencil-drawn figures on heavy watercolor paper. They would walk in the woods daily and Balanchine would choreograph by imitating the dances of different birds. They both died in 1983, Balanchine in April and Karinska in October; two weeks after her 97th birthday. In 1999, Karinska was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame.  The \\"Powder Puff\\" Tutu  With a large assembly of dancers on stage ‚Äì as was often preferred by Balanchine‚Äîthe traditional \\"pancake\\" tutu with its stiff wired layer would bob and dip when the dancers' skirts brushed up against one another and this bobbing and dipping would reverberate long after the steps were complete. Karinska solved this problem by devising the \\"powder puff\\" tutu, with a shorter skirt made of six or seven layers of gathered net, each layer a half inch longer than the preceding layer. The layers were tacked together for a fluffier, looser appearance than the stiff \\"pancake\\" tutu. Because the shorter layers are self-supporting, no wire hoop is needed in the \\"powder puff\\" tutu, aka the Balanchine-Karinska tutu. This tutu design has become standard in ballet companies all over the world since it first appeared in 1950, in the ballet Symphony in C. Balanchine said, \\"I attribute to [Karinska] fifty percent of the success of my ballets to those that she has dressed.\\" Karinska collaborated with Balanchine on seventy-five ballets in all. The first ballet she made for Balanchine from her own designs was Bourr√©e Fantasque in 1949. In 1956, for Balanchine's Allegro Brillante, Karinska created the knee-length chiffon ballet dress, which has also become a standard design for ballet costumes.

In this binary model, sex, gender, and sexuality may be assumed by default to align, with aspects of one's gender inherently linked to one's genetic or gamete-based sex, or with one's sex assigned at birth. For example, when a male is born, gender binarism may assume the male will be masculine in appearance, character traits, and behavior, including having a heterosexual attraction to females. These aspects may include expectations of dressing, behavior, sexual orientation, names or pronouns, preferred restroom, or other qualities. These expectations may reinforce negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination towards people who display expressions of gender variance or nonconformity or whose gender identity is incongruent with their birth sex. General aspects The term gender binary describes the system in which a society allocates its members into one of two sets of gender roles, gender identities, and attributes based on the type of genitalia. In the case of people born with organs that fall outside this classification system (intersex people), enforcement of the binary often includes coercive surgical gender reassignment. Intersex people often identify anatomically as male or female; however, their innate gender identity may be different. Gender binary therefore focuses primarily on one's innate identity irrespective of their anatomical features. Gender roles are a major aspect of the gender binary. Gender roles shape and constrain people's life experiences, impacting aspects of self-expression ranging from clothing choices to occupation. Most people have feminine and masculine psychological characteristics. Traditional gender roles are influenced by the media, religion, mainstream education, political systems, cultural systems, and social systems. Major religions such as Islam and Christianity, in particular, act as authorities for gender roles. Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children and the Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination, only ordains cisgender men as priests. Christianity supports its adherence to a gender binary with the Book of Genesis in the Bible, where it is declared in verse 27 that \\"God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\\" Orthodox Judaism also forbids women to be ordained as rabbis and serve as clergy in their congregations. In English, some nouns (e.g., boy), honorific titles (e.g., Miss), occupational titles (e.g., actress), and pronouns (e.g., she, his) are gendered, and they fall into a male/female binary. Children raised within English-speaking (and other gendered-language) environments come to view gender as a binary category. Studies have found that for children who learn English as their primary language in the U.S., adults' use of the gender binary to explicitly sort individuals (i.e. \\"boys\\" and \\"girls\\" bathrooms and softball teams), as opposed to just the presence of gender markers, causes gender biases. According to Thomas Keith in Masculinities in Contemporary American Culture, the longstanding cultural assumption that male‚Äìfemale dualities are \\"natural and immutable\\" partly explains the persistence of systems of patriarchy and male privilege in modern society. Hyde and colleagues suggest that gender being visibly marked makes it become unnaturally psychologically salient.  In the LGBT community  Gender binarism may create institutionalized structures of power, and individuals who identify outside traditional gender binaries may experience discrimination and harassment within the LGBT community. Most of this discrimination stems from societal expectations of gender that are expressed in the LGBT community. But many LGBT people and many youth activist groups advocate against gender binarism within the LGBT community. Many individuals within the LGBT+ community report an internal hierarchy of power status. Some who do not identify within a binary system experience being at the bottom of the hierarchy. The multitude of different variables such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, and more can lower or raise one's perceived power. Worldwide, there are many individuals and several subcultures that can be considered exceptions to the gender binary or specific transgender identities. In addition to individuals whose bodies are naturally intersex, there are also specific social roles that involve aspects of both or neither of the binary genders. These include Two-Spirit Native Americans and hijra of India. Feminist philosopher Mar√≠a Lugones argues Western colonizers imposed their dualistic ideas of gender on indigenous peoples, replacing pre-existing indigenous concepts. In the contemporary West, non-binary or genderqueer people break the gender binary by refusing terms like \\"male\\" and \\"female\\". Transgender people have a unique place in relation to the gender binary. In some cases, attempting to conform to societal expectations for their gender, transsexual individuals may opt for surgery, hormones, or both. Limitations and rejection Some feminist scholars have contested the existence of a clear gender binary. Judith Lorber explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups \\"even though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences.\\"Lorber, Judith. \\"Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.\\" In The Gendered Society Reader, edited by Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, and Amy Kaler, 11-18. Toronto, ON: Oxford University Press, 2011. Lorber argues that this corroborates the fact that the gender binary is arbitrary and leads to false expectations of both men and women. Instead, there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without \\"prior assumptions about who is like whom\\". Scholars who study the gender binary from an intersectional feminism and critical race theory perspective agree that during the process of European colonization of the U.S., a binary system of gender was created and enforced as a means of protecting patriarchal norms and upholding European nationalism. This idea of a gender as a binary is thought to be an oppressive means of reflecting differential power dynamics. Studies of Two Spirit traditions have shown that various Native American nations understand gender and sexuality in a way that directly opposes Western norms. Gender binarism also poses limitations on the adequacy of medical care provided to gender nonconforming patients. There is a large gap in medical literature on nonbinary populations who have unique healthcare needs. Anne Fausto-Sterling suggests a classification of 23 sexes and to move away from the classification of male and female. In her paper \\"The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough\\", she discusses the existence of intersex people, individuals possessing a combination of male and female sexual characteristics, who are seen as deviations from the norm, and who frequently undergo coercive surgery at a very young age in order to maintain the two- gender system. The existence of these individuals challenges the standards of gender binaries and puts into question society's role in constructing gender. Fausto-Sterling says that modern practitioners encourage the idea that gender is a cultural construct and concludes that, \\"we are moving from an era of sexual dimorphism to one of variety beyond the number 2.\\" See also References Further reading * binaohan, b. decolonizing trans/gender 101. biyuti publishing, 2014. *GenderQueer: Voices from Beyond the Sexual Binary (Alyson), (Joan Nestle, Clair Howell Co-Editors) 2002 * Category:Dichotomies Category:Gender identity Category:Feminist terminology Category:Feminist theory Category:Queer theory Category:Transgender Category:Anti-LGBT sentiment Category:Sexism ","title":"Gender binary"},{"id":"4519079","text":"Barabinsk () is a town in Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia, located in the Baraba steppe on the Trans-Siberian Railway between Omsk and Novosibirsk.

Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that Title IX, which applies only to colleges and universities that receive federal funds, could be applied to a private school that refused direct federal funding but for which a large number of students had received federally funded scholarships. The Court also held that the federal government could require a statutorily mandated \\"assurance of compliance\\" with Title IX even though no evidence had been presented to suggest that Grove City College had discriminated. However, the Court also held that the regulation would apply only to the institution's financial aid department, not to the school as a whole. Opinion of the court Justice Byron White delivered the opinion of the Court, which was unanimous except for Part III. In an opinion by White, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Harry Blackmun, Lewis Powell, William Rehnquist, and Sandra Day O'Connor, it was held that (1) Title IX applied to the college, even though it accepted no direct assistance, since it did enroll students who received BEOGs, (2) for Title IX enforcement purposes, the education program or activity at the college receiving federal financial assistance was the college's financial aid program, and not the entire college, (3) federal assistance to the college's financial aid program could be terminated solely because the college had refused to execute an assurance of compliance with Title IX, and (4) the application of Title IX to the college did not infringe the First Amendment rights of the college or its students. Concurring and dissenting opinions Lewis Franklin Powell Jr. joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Sandra Day O'Connor, concurred, expressing the view that the above holdings were dictated by the language and legislative history of Title IX and the regulations of the Department of Education. John Paul Stevens concurred in part and concurred in the result, stating that he was unable to join in holding 2 above because he considered it an advisory opinion unnecessary to the overall decision and because it was predicated on speculation rather than evidence. William Brennan joined by Thurgood Marshall concurred in part and dissented in part, expressing the view that the program-specific language in Title IX was designed to insure that the reach of the statute is dependent upon the scope of federal financial assistance provided to the college, so that when the financial assistance is clearly intended to serve as federal aid for the entire college, the college as a whole should be covered by the prohibition on sex discrimination. Overturning of decision The holding that compliance with Title IX is necessary only in the particular programs or activities that receive federal funding was abrogated when the United States Congress subsequently passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, which specified that recipients of federal funds must comply with civil rights laws in all areas.

He joined CNN in May 2006, after five years with sister publication Time. His last on-air appearance for the network was in December 2009. He was one of the few mainstream reporters to live in Iraq near-continuously since before the American invasion and gained early acclaim due to his willingness to establish contacts with the Kurdish Peshmerga and the Iraqi insurgency. He reported on the severity of the growing opposition Western coalition forces faced in mid-2003, and his contacts have provided him with controversial videotapes of attacks on coalition forces, including the murder of four Blackwater contractors. Ware has been embedded with American and British military forces on numerous occasions, and the coalition forces have been the focus of many of his reports describing conditions in Iraq. As of 2015 he is working on a book about the Iraq war, titled Between Me and the Dead. The title comes from a conversation he had with a friend in the Marines; when asked how he deals with civilians asking how many people he's killed, the Marine said he replies, \\"That's between me and the dead.\\" Life and career Michael Ware is a native of Brisbane (Queensland), Australia. He is a graduate of Brisbane Grammar School, and he earned a Bachelor of Laws and a degree in Political Science from the University of Queensland. He spent a year as Associate to then- President of the Supreme Court of Queensland Tony Fitzgerald before moving into journalism. He worked for The Courier-Mail in Brisbane (1995‚Äì2000) and gained local notice after a series of articles led to a formal investigation into police handling (or lack thereof) of a paedophile ring. Ware declined to name sources who had provided him with internal police documents in the matter. His earliest assignments for Time magazine took him to East Timor in 2000; and, in December 2001, he went into Afghanistan to cover the U.S. search for al-Qaeda. As preparations for the invasion of Iraq began in early 2003, Ware relocated to the Kurdistan area. Although he has gone into battles embedded with U.S. forces, he also travelled to insurgent camps and reported on their perspective of the war. His Time bylines include reports from Kabul, Kandahar, Fallujah, Tikrit, Tal Afar, Mosul, Samarra, Ramadi, and Baghdad. In September 2004, while investigating reports that Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi's nascent \\"al-Qaeda in Iraq\\" group was openly claiming control of the Haifa Street area of Baghdad, Ware was briefly held at gunpoint by fighters loyal to Zarqawi who had pulled pins from live grenades and forced his car to stop. The men dragged him from the car and stood him beneath one of the banners, intending to film his execution with his own video camera. By threatening them with immediate and violent retaliation, his local guides, including members of the Ba'ath Party, were able to win his release. Ware has stated that, had this happened only a few months later, when Zarqawi's group had grown stronger, he would have been killed. In October 2004, he was named Time magazine's Baghdad Bureau Chief. He was embedded for the September 2005 assault on Tal Afar, and his harrowing video of the battle has been included in a Frontline documentary and a 60 Minutes report. When with CNN, he was partnered with Thomas Evans, who produced for Anderson Cooper.

Howard. Honeymoon in Red is sometimes referred to as a band or alternately as a collaboration between Lydia Lunch and The Birthday Party.  Content   Music  Honeymoon in Red is musically eclectic, combining elements of burlesque, no wave, singer/songwriter Jacques Brel, American Underground, the use of a \\"varispeed\\" for atmospherics, a song by country pop songwriter Lee Hazlewood, dissonant piano and guitar and muscular bass guitar and the darkly charismatic personas of Nick Cave and Lydia Lunch. The album generally resembles the angular pop of The Birthday Party's Prayers on Fire, although the song \\"Dead in the Head\\" recalls the strident guitar playing of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. Unlike The Birthday Party, Honeymoon In Red emphasises vernacular speech akin to 1970s American television and film, instead of emulating the Southern Gothic literary genre. In a 1983 television interview, Lunch spoke of the experimental music as \\"religious music\\" that was \\"not rock\\".  Album cover  The album's graphic design resembled a lurid 1950s Saul Bass movie poster, with cockfighting motifs. The liner notes from Lunch titled \\"THE TERRORTORY\\" comments on commercial and religious puritanical attitudes. It included an Annie Sprinkle photograph of Lunch's body superimposed onto a rural roadmap, also a photograph by Chris Stein of Lunch wearing a \\"suicide blonde\\" wig and heavy make up, holding up a large pistol. Fallout and release Mick Harvey has stated that the project was originally conceived as a new band; a collaboration between Harvey, Lunch, Genevieve McGuckin and Rowland S. Howard. After the initial recording sessions in Berlin in June 1982, the tapes languished without a release. In 1987 Lunch readied the tapes for release on her own Widowspeak label, with added contributions by J.G. Thirlwell and Thurston Moore. Lunch had already fallen out with Nick Cave and Harvey, and they insisted that their names not appear on the release, as they had no hand in the remix and overdubbing. Lunch subsequently used pseudonyms for Cave and Harvey (including \\"A drunk cowboy junkie\\" and \\"Dick Strum\\", respectively) and obliquely criticized them in her liner notes as \\"tight asses\\" and \\"sheep in wolf's clothing\\". The album originally appeared in this reworked form but has subsequently been reissued with the mixes from the original 1982 Berlin sessions. A 12\\" single of \\"Done Dun\\" (a Cave/Lunch duet) was released on side B of the Lydia Lunch/Thurston Moore/Clint Ruin single \\"The Crumb\\", and referred to The Honeymoon in Red Orchestra.

In Australian rules football, a banner is a large cr√™pe paper and sticky-tape banner constructed by each team's cheer squad. It is hoisted before the start of a match, and typically shows an encouraging or celebratory message to the team; then, as the players take to the field, they run through the banner, breaking it. Traditionally, the captain, or a milestone-achieving player leads the team when breaking the banner. Tracing its origins to the 1930s, the concept of the Australian rules football banner is unique in world sport, and has become standard at all AFL matches. Construction Banners are made from cr√™pe paper and sticky tape, and are attached to two long poles which are used to hold the banner up for the players to run through. Banners are generally at least 8-10 m long, and over 3.5 m or 4 m high - cr√™pe paper is not strong, and so a lot of sticky tape is used to keep the banner together, particularly at the poles. There are two general ways that the banners are taped together: taping parallel lines every six inches along the length of the banner for its entire height, or; taping in both directions to produce 1 ft square panels. With extra tape on the edges and at the pole, this makes the banner a fairly sturdy construction which the players have no trouble breaking through. Thicker tape is used at the top of the banner, and thinner tape at the bottom. This enables players to run through the banner and not get caught in the tape. 4 inch thick tape is the thickest tape most cheersquads use, and 1 inch is the smallest. Some cheer squads, such as that of Carlton, have a permanent upper half made from cloth, and tape cr√™pe paper only across the lower half through which players run. Each week, they will reuse the top half by taping new letters to it. In 2014, some teams created full fabric curtains rather than use crepe paper. A small split in the lower centre area allowed the players to pass through it. The fabric could be reused each week, saving money and time. However, this limits the design options. Most banners have one base colour, which in the past was almost always the team's main colour, and writing in the team's secondary colour or colours; for example, Essendon, who wear black with a red sash, would have a black banner with red writing. However, these days it is not uncommon for teams to invert the colours. History Older terminology for what is currently known as a banner is \\"the race\\", named after the caged wire tunnel separating players from patrons that the players traverse to enter the playing arena. This tunnel is known as \\"the race\\" or \\"the players race\\". Supporters would \\"decorate the race\\", hence the name. A \\"race\\" first appeared at the 1939 VFL Grand Final, with Collingwood running on to the ground through a loose tapestry of woven streamers attached to the players race. This system evolved with the loose tapestry changing to a tightly knitted tapestry. Essendon's VFL Grand Final races of 1947 & 1949 show the difference: the former is a looser tapestry, the latter tightly woven. Decorating the race continued until 1962: some clubs mounted a sign with the club emblem above the race, adding to the size and beauty of the creation. Similar to the race decoration, many supporters wove steamers through fence pickets near their seats to demonstrate their support for their team. These decorations evolved to small fabric signs hung on the fence, and later again, they evolved to larger fabric fence-mounted banners. In 1960, one of the first banners affixed to the MCG Southern Stand simply read, \\"Collingwood Forever\\".VFL On Film: 1946-1982 - Marking Time Volume 2 In 1961 a \\"Magpies\\" banner was affixed to the fence directly between the goal posts at an MCG finals game when Carlton Football Club player John James was presented with his Brownlow Medal.VFL On Film: 1946-1982 - Marking Time Volume 2 One of the first of the longer banners to traverse quite some length of the fence was at the 1962 VFL Grand Final. It read, \\"Come on Carlton - The Mighty Blues\\", behind which sat the Carlton Cheer Squad.1962 Grand Final video, Carlton v Essendon Cheer Squads, typically, made these longer banners and during 1963 most clubs‚Äô cheer squads had created lengthy banners for mounting to the fence for their club's games. Sometimes, during VFL finals, banners of a non-competing team may appear, often because the club may have had a reserves team competing in an earlier game on the day. An example of this is a prominently mounted Collingwood banner during the 1966 Essendon v St Kilda VFL Preliminary Final. With the introduction of fence mounted advertising hoarding, there was no room available for cheer squads banners. One of the last VFL games to have banners was the 1982 Grand Final with a long Richmond banner mounted on the MCG Southern and Ponsford Stands. By 1984 and 1985 Grand Finals, advertising filled the fence, and although space remained available at Grandstand level, only a few banners were erected. In the little space available on the Ponsford Stand, there were no banners erected at the 1986 Grand Final. At the raising of Collingwood's 2010 premiership flag in 2011, a re-creation of the banner that read \\"Collingwood Domination Envy of the Nation\\" was mounted on the Great Southern Stand. Cheer squads also evolved the size of \\"floggers\\" - crepe streamers attached to sticks in club colors and waved in support of their team, which were banned in 1978. In 1963, poles were added to the \\"race\\" to enable it to be portable, and the woven crepe paper construction was moved from the end of the players race onto the arena playing surface. The transition is best shown at the 1963 Grand Final where Hawthorn's race was the older style mounted to the end of the players race, whilst Geelong's race was the newer portable style. Typically, cheer squad members held the poles. With poles being used, the creation of the race was no longer limited to the size of the players race, and they became incrementally larger throughout the late 1960s. Words and messages first appeared on the race sometime between 1966 and 1970. Up until the early 1970s a race was not created for every game. Because they were cumbersome and tedious to construct, they were reserved only for special occasions, such as finals games and player milestones. As cheer squad's funded the costs themselves, not all cheer squads could afford a race each week. A terminology change occurred in the mid 1970s. \\"The race\\" became a \\"run-through\\". There was no specific reason for the change of name, other than a generational change of cheer squad members. However, media reports from the 1960s and early 1970s had often used the name \\"banner\\", a precursor of what was to come. During the 1970s run-throughs became wider and taller. Due to the increased size of run- throughs in the early 1980s, ropes began being used for additional support. Each week, the cheer squad would gather, and construct from crepe paper and adhesive tape, a run-through with an inspirational message, or a message derogatory of the other team, on each side. With fence mounted banners rarely in use, the terminology for a run-through became \\"banner\\". Banners were now several metres tall, and the few supporters holding the poles from the base were replaced with three supporters holding tethers from the top of the pole and five or six at the base, for each pole. It is generally raised 20 or 30 metres away from the fence. Traditionally, the captain would lead the team through the run-through, with his teammates trailing behind. During the 1980s teams began to gather their players in front of the banner before breaking through it together in a display of togetherness and teamwork. Advertising first appeared on run-throughs in the late 1970s. Costs increased commensurate with the size of the run-through, creating a need for additional funding. Early advertising was in club colors and often incorporated into the run- through's message. After 2000, approximately, advertising logos often appeared in their own color. If different from the club colors, this detracts from the visual effect of the banner. Inspirational, or anti-opposition, messages were replaced by advertising slogans, creating an insipid feel to the banner. In 2014, Collingwood Football Club banned the cheer squad from creating or holding the team's banner. The club now arranges this themselves. They have replaced the traditional crepe banner with a fabric curtain. It remains to be seen if terminology will change again. The curtain method is also used by other clubs. Uses There are five main functions that a banner can take. As it is a double-sided construction, which the cheer squad usually hoists in all four directions to allow all fans to read each side, most of these are seen each week. *Inspirational messages: these are generally found in the form of a four-line rhyming message. They can be fairly predictable, and usually will the team on to beat the opposition and continue up the ladder. *Demotivational messages: when an opponent, particularly a hated one, is coming off a bad loss or is having a bad year, it is common for cheer squads to use the banner to annoy the opposition fans. This is particularly prevalent amongst more heated rivalries, such as Carlton and Collingwood, or Adelaide and Port Adelaide. *Celebration of milestones: when a player is playing a milestone game - his 50th, 100th, 150th etc. AFL game or club game, or a record-breaking game, it is standard practice to reward that effort by emblazoning his name and often a picture of him on the banner. In these circumstances, it is accepted that the milestone player will lead the team through the banner instead of the captain, unless the player is the captain. *Advertising club events: one side of a banner will often be used to advertise an upcoming family day, best and fairest night, or to spruik for memberships at the beginning of a season. *Advertising sponsors: while not historically a feature, it is now accepted that club sponsors will pay the cheer squad to have their logo on the banner. Usually, the sponsors name will feature on plastic sheathes into which the poles are slotted, and the banner is attached between the two. Banners outside the AFL It is common for junior clubs to prepare small banners when one of their players is playing a milestone game. This arises from the fact that banners are much loved by children when they go to the football, and clubs like to oblige their desires. Junior milestone banners are generally no bigger than 2√ó3 m, and the team usually lines up to form a guard of honour for the player before he bursts through his own banner. In 1983, The Balranald Roos Football Club had a Grand Final banner measuring 7 metres high x 23 metres wide. On one side it read, \\"History in the Making\\". On the reverse side, \\"Bring It On Home\\". It was created by Richmond Cheer Squad, in recognition of retired VFL player Jim Jess, who was then playing for Balranald. The Melbourne Storm come through a banner when they take to the field at their home ground, AAMI Park and at their old ground, Olympic Park. Banners have never been a part of the NRL, but cheer squads from Melbourne were keen to bring the AFL practice into their adopted sport, as Victoria, in particular Melbourne, is Australian Rules Football heartland. Banner incidents, customs and superstitions As crepe paper and sticky tape is not renowned for its strength, banners will often rip in places, or even be completely de-poled if the weather is very windy or wet. Seeing an opponent's banner de-poled is always a source of amusement for fans, leaving their opponent open to ridicule. In 1971, St Kilda's Cheer Squad mocked their poorly performing opposition in a match against South Melbourne when the St Kilda run-through read \\"South Melbourne the Invincible Masters and Supreme Conquerors of...\\" and on the reverse side, \\"the wooden spoon\\". In response to this, the St Kilda captain, Ross Smith, and several St Kilda players ran around the run-through, not through it. In 1972, an Essendon supporter ran through the Collingwood run-through at Victoria Park before being detained by security. Collingwood fans invaded the ground and demolished the Essendon run- through in retaliation for the incident. In 1975, Collingwood supported Hawthorn captain Peter Crimmins in his fight against cancer, with the simple message, \\"Collingwood supports Crimmins\\". Later that year, Collingwood derided former player, and then Essendon captain-coach, Des Tuddenham with a banner that read, \\"Sgt Tuddy's Lonely Tarts Club Band\\", a play on a Beatles song title. In 1980, Collingwood ridiculed Carlton's new coach, Peter \\"Percy\\" Jones, with a banner that read \\"Percy Jones - The Mind That Launched Larundel\\", a reference to an asylum in the nearby suburb of Bundoora. In protest at their club's imminent relocation to Sydney, South Melbourne Cheer Squad made an all black 'mourning' banner in 1981. Their captain and several players ran around the banner as it was not in South Melbourne's red and white team colors, and did not realise it was theirs to run through. Another South Melbourne banner that year read \\"South Melbourne - you sold your soul.\\" Multiple premiership player and coach Ron Barassi returned to coach Melbourne in 1981. Coming into the last round, the Demons were 1-20, one game behind Footscray but with a superior percentage: if they won and the Bulldogs lost, they would avoid the wooden spoon at the Bulldogs' expense, otherwise Barassi, for his first time in his career, would be involved with a 'wooden spooner'. At the beginning of the last game of the season against Hawthorn, the Hawthorn cheer squad poked fun at this situation, with the Hawthorn run-through reading \\"Congratulations on your first spoon Ron\\", which was greeted with laughter by Barassi. Hawthorn won the match by 53 points, meaning that Melbourne won the wooden spoon. For Kevin Bartlett's 400th game in 1983, the Richmond cheer squad created a banner 10 metres high by 20 metres wide. Carlton's Cheer Squad were denied permission to use a social club room to make one of their banners in 1984. In protest, on game day they held up two poles with no banner.http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-browse_gallery.php?galleryId=595 During a dispute with their club in 1985, Collingwood Cheer Squad refused to make a banner for a game against St Kilda. In 1986, the St Kilda cheer squad reacted to media rumours that their struggling club was going to be relocated to Brisbane with a banner that read: \\"St Kilda is here to stay and that's the final say.\\" A year later, after the Brisbane Bears and West Coast had been admitted, the Saints ran through another banner that read \\"VFL not NFL\\".Banter, Bulldogs and the changing banner As talks of a merger between Footscray and Fitzroy emerged in 1989, Ron Barassi suggested that Footscray was suffering because the suburb had changed due to drugs and a growing Asian population. In response to this, the cheer squad banner retorted: \\"Barassi we love our Western Oval + our ethnic + Asian community. Leave us alone.\\" In Round 16, 1996, the Fitzroy cheer squad protested the club's immenient takeover by Brisbane (after a similar offer by North Melbourne had collapsed) by revealing a banner that read \\"Seduced by North, Raped By Brisbane, F*****d by the AFL\\". In Round 1, 2005, Melbourne and Essendon paid tribute to Melbourne's Troy Broadbridge, who was killed in the Boxing Day tsunami with a special banner precession. The two cheer squads set their banners up side-by- side in the centre of the wing, and the teams observed a minute silence before breaking through their banners at the same time. The joint banner tribute was repeated in 2013, when Collingwood and Port Adelaide ran through a single banner to remember John McCarthy, a former player of both teams who died the previous October. In each of the games played in the round following the death of Adelaide Football Club coach Phillip Walsh in July 2015, no banners were used and the club songs weren't played. When Adelaide played Port Adelaide in Showdown XXXIX the following week, the two teams both ran through a single large black banner without any advertising logos, with one of Walsh's favourite sayings \\"Get the job done\\" written on one side and \\"Vale Phil Walsh\\" on the other. Walsh had been an assistant coach at Port Adelaide prior to becoming the head coach at Adelaide. Some players have superstitions or routines regarding the banner. One such superstition is that some players like to be the first one through the banner. Even though it is customary for the captain (or milestone player) to lead the team through the banner, it is often the case that the superstitious player walks up to the banner alongside his leading captain, and then reaches out to touch the paper first. Other players, notably Matthew Richardson and Brendan Fevola, avoid touching the banner altogether. While they will run through it, they will usually trail the pack, and try to avoid any hanging paper. Richardson's superstition led to a special banner being made for his 150th game - it had a very large opening in the centre base to allow Richardson to lead his team straight through it. Other routines include always kicking a football at the banner before running through it, or simply running around it or under it instead of through it.

Hydroworld, Volume 33, Issue 2. The original turbine was placed in service in 1973. After years of heavy vibration and a poorly matched turbine design, one of the blades catastrophically failed in February 2009, causing an immediate shutdown of the plant. The sheared off blade, weighing , was later recovered from the river. The turbine runner was repaired in 2010 by welding the old blade back in place. Other cracks were also discovered and repaired at this time. While the repaired turbine was operating, the Corps of Engineers and contractors tried to determine how to correct the issues at Stockton Dam. Analysis concluded that the original turbine was likely rated for a much different site due to its ability to spin at nearly full power without tilting the blades past their \\"full flat\\" setting. Why the turbine and generator were mismatched has not been determined. Due to the significant issues and age of the turbine, an entirely new one was custom designed for replacement in 2014-2015.
