It is a key prediction of the folding funnel hypothesis of the energy landscape theory of proteins. Overview Downhill folding is predicted to occur under conditions of extreme native bias, i.e. at low temperatures or in the absence of denaturants. This corresponds to the type 0 scenario in the energy landscape theory. At temperatures or denaturant concentrations close to their apparent midpoints, proteins may switch from downhill to two-state folding, the type 0 to type 1 transition. Global downhill folding (or one-state folding) is another scenario in which the protein folds in the absence of a free energy barrier under all conditions. In other words, there is a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures and denaturant concentrations, suggesting a continuous unfolding transition in which different ensembles of structures populate at different conditions. This is in contrast to two-state folding, which assumes only two ensembles (folded and unfolded) and a sharp unfolding transition. Free energy barriers in protein folding are predicted to be small because they arise as a result of compensation between large energetic and entropic terms. Non-synchronization between gain in stabilizing energy and loss in conformational entropy results in two-state folding, while a synchronization between these two terms as the folding proceeds results in downhill folding. Experimental studies Transition state structures in two- state folding are not experimentally accessible (by definition they are the least populated along the reaction coordinate), but the folding sub-ensembles in downhill folding processes are theoretically distinguishable by spectroscopy. The 40-residue protein BBL, which is an independently folding domain from the E2 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complex of E. coli, has been experimentally shown to fold globally downhill. Also, a mutant of lambda repressor protein has been shown to shift from downhill to two-state upon changing the temperature/solvent conditions. However, the status of BBL as a downhill-folding protein, and by extension the existence of naturally occurring downhill folders, has been controversial. The current controversy arises from the fact that the only way a protein can be labeled as two-state or downhill is by analyzing the experimental data with models that explicitly deal with these two situations, i.e. by allowing the barrier heights to vary. Unfortunately, most of the experimental data so far have been analyzed with a simple chemical two-state model. In other words, the presence of a rather large free energy barrier has been pre-assumed, ruling out the possibility of identifying downhill or globally downhill protein folding. This is critical because any sigmoidal unfolding curve, irrespective of the degree of cooperativity, can be fit to a two-state model. Kinetically, the presence of a barrier guarantees a single-exponential, but not vice versa. Nevertheless, in some proteins such as the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase and a mutant human ubiquitin, non-exponential kinetics suggesting downhill folding have been observed. A proposed solution to these problems is to develop models that can differentiate between the different situations, and identify simple but robust experimental criteria for identifying downhill folding proteins. These are outlined below. Equilibrium criteria Differences in apparent melting temperatures An analysis based on an extension of Zwanzig's model of protein folding indicates that global downhill folding proteins should reveal different apparent melting temperatures (Tms) when monitored by different techniques. This was experimentally confirmed in the protein BBL mentioned above. The unfolding followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence all revealed different apparent melting temperatures. A wavelength-dependent melting temperature was also observed in the CD experiments. The data analyzed with a structure-based statistical mechanical model resulted in a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures, indicating a structurally uncoupled continuous unfolding process. The crucial issue in such experiments is to use probes that monitor different aspects of the structure. For example, DSC gives information on the heat capacity changes (and hence enthalpy) associated with unfolding, fluorescence on the immediate environment of the fluorophore, FRET on the average dimensions of the molecule and CD on the secondary structure. A more stringent test would involve following the chemical shifts of each and every atom in the molecule by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as a function of temperature/denaturant. Though time-consuming, this method does not require any specific model for the interpretation of data. The Tms for all the atoms should be identical within experimental error if the protein folds in a two-state manner. But for a protein that folds globally downhill the unfolding curves should have widely different Tms. The atomic unfolding behavior of BBL was found to follow the latter, showing a large spread in the Tms consistent with global downhill behavior. The Tms of some atoms were found to be similar to that of the global Tm (obtained from a low-resolution technique like CD or fluorescence), indicating that the unfolding of multiple atoms has to be followed, instead of a few as is frequently done in such experiments. The average atomic unfolding behavior was strikingly similar to that of CD, underlining the fact that unfolding curves of low resolution experiments are highly simplified representations of a more complex behavior. Calorimetry and crossing baselines Baselines frequently used in two-state fits correspond to the fluctuations in the folded or unfolded well. They are purely empirical as there is little or no information on how the folded or unfolded states' property changes with temperature/chemical denaturant. This assumes even more importance in case of DSC experiments as the changes in heat capacity correspond to both fluctuations in the protein ensemble and exposure of hydrophobic residues upon unfolding. The DSC profiles of many small fast- folding proteins are broad, with steep pre-transition slopes. Two-state fits to these profiles result in crossing of baselines indicating that the two- state assumption is no longer valid. This was recognized by Munoz and Sanchez- Ruiz, resulting in the development of the variable-barrier model. Instead of attempting a model-free inversion of the DSC profile to extract the underlying probability density function, they assumed a specific free energy functional with either one or two minima (similar to the Landau theory of phase transitions) thus enabling the extraction of free energy barrier heights. This model is the first of its kind in physical biochemistry that enables the determination of barrier heights from equilibrium experiments. Analysis of the DSC profile of BBL with this model resulted in zero barrier height, i.e. downhill folding, confirming the earlier result from the statistical mechanical model. When the variable-barrier model was applied to a set of proteins for which both the rate and DSC data are available, a very high correlation of 0.95 was obtained between the rates and barrier heights. Many of the proteins examined had small barriers (<20 kJ/mol) with baseline crossing evident for proteins that fold faster than 1 ms. This is in contrast to the traditional assumption that the free energy barrier between the folded and unfolded states are large. Simulations Because downhill folding is difficult to measure experimentally, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have been performed on fast-folding proteins to explore their folding kinetics. Proteins whose folding rate is at or near the folding \\"speed limit\\", whose timescales make their folding more accessible to simulation methods, may more commonly fold downhill. Simulation studies of the BBL protein imply that its rapid folding rate and very low energy barrier arise from a lack of cooperativity in the formation of native contacts during the folding process; that is, a low contact order. The link between lack of cooperativity and low contact order was also observed in the context of Monte Carlo lattice simulations These data suggest that the average number of \\"nonlocal contacts\\" per residue in a protein serves as an indicator of the barrier height, where very low nonlocal contact values imply downhill folding. Coarse-grained simulations by Knott and Chan also support the experimental observation of global downhill folding in BBL.

Electrical/Electronics engineering technology (EET) is an engineering technology field that implements and applies the principles of electrical engineering. Like electrical engineering, EET deals with the \\"design, application, installation, manufacturing, operation or maintenance of electrical/electronic(s) systems.\\" However, EET is a specialized discipline that has more focus on application, theory, and applied design, and implementation, while electrical engineering may focus more of a generalized emphasis on theory and conceptual design. Electrical/Electronic engineering technology is the largest branch of engineering technology and includes a diverse range of sub-disciplines, such as applied design, electronics, embedded systems, control systems, instrumentation, telecommunications, and power systems. Education Accreditation The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the recognized organization for accrediting both undergraduate engineering and engineering technology programs in the United States. Coursework EET curricula can vary widely by institution type, degree type, program objective, and expected student outcome. Each year after, however, ABET publishes a set of minimum criteria that a given EET program (either associate degree or bachelor's degree) must meet in order to maintain its ABET accreditation. These criteria may be classified as either general criteria, which apply to all ABET accredited programs, or as program criteria, which apply to discipline-specific criteria. Associate degree Associate degree programs emphasize the practical field knowledge that is needed to maintain or troubleshoot existing electrical/electronic systems or to build and test new design prototypes. Discipline-specific program outcomes include the application of circuit analysis and design, analog and digital electronics, computer programming, associated software, and relevant engineering standards Coursework must be at a minimum algebra and trigonometry based. Bachelor's degree Bachelor's degree programs emphasize the analysis, design, and implementation of electrical/electronic systems. Some programs may focus on a specific sub-discipline, such as control systems or communications systems, while others may take a broader approach, introducing the student to several different sub-disciplines. Math to differential equations is a minimum requirement for ABET accredited bachelor's level EET degrees. In addition, graduates must demonstrate an understanding of basic project management skills. The United States Department of Commerce classifies the bachelor of science in electrical engineering technology (BSEET) as a STEM undergraduate engineering degree field. In many states, recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate BSEET degree are qualified to sit-in for the Fundamentals of Engineering exam while those BSEETs who have already gained at least four years‚Äô post-college experience are qualified to sit-in for the Professional Engineer exam for their licensure in the United States. The importance of the licensing board requirements depend upon location, level of education, required years of experience, and the BSEETs sub-discipline are the passageways for becoming a licensed engineer. The knowledge obtained by a TAC/ABET accredited program is one pathway that may help students prepare for and pass the FE/PE exam. For example, in the United States and Canada, \\"only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients\\". Career Graduates of electrical/electronics engineering technology programs work in a wide range of career fields. Some examples include: *Engineering management *Telecommunications *Signal processing *Medical technology and devices *Instrumentation *Integration Engineer *Control *Aerospace and avionics *Computers *Electrical power industry and power distribution *Optics and Optoelectronics *Manufacturing and manufacturing test engineer *Marine Engineering *Research and development *Project management and Operations research *Supervision/Management *Systems analyst *Technology management  Associate degree  Electrical/electronic engineering technicians may have a two-year associate degree and considered craftsman technicians. Eventually, with additional experience and certifications obtained then the craftsman technicians may advance to master craftsman technicians.  Bachelor degree  Electrical/electronic engineering technologists are broad specialists, rather than central technicians. EETs have a bachelor's degree and are considered applied electrical or electronic engineers because they have electrical engineering concepts to use in their work. Entry-level jobs in electrical or electronics engineering generally require a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, or _electrical engineering technology_.

Officially dubbed a \\"passport checking operation,\\" the ostensible goal launched by the Soviet Union's internal and defense ministries was to disarm Armenian militia detachments that had been organized in \\"[illegally] armed formations.\\"De Waal, Thomas. Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War. New York: New York University Press, 2003, p. 114. . The operation involved the use of ground troops who accompanied a complement of military vehicles, artillery and helicopter gunships to be used to root out the self-described Armenian fedayeen. However, contrary to their stated objectives, Soviet troops and the predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the AzSSR OMON and army forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages strewn across Shahumyan to leave their homes and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR.Gokhman, M. \\"–ö–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ö—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–æ–π–Ω–∞,\\" [The Karabakh War] Russkaya Misl. 29 November 1991. Following this, the Armenian inhabitants of 17 villages across the Shushi and Hadrut regions were forcibly removed. British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war.De Waal. Black Garden, p. 120. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing.Melander, Erik in \\"State Manipulation or Nationalist Ambition\\" in The Role of the State in West Asia, eds. Annika Rabo and Bo Utas. New York: I.B. Tauris, 2006, p. 173. . The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.Human Rights Watch/Helsinki (1994). Azerbaijan: Seven years of conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. New York: Human Rights Watch, p. 9. Background The Nagorno-Karabakh movement that had originally begun in Armenia during the late 1980s called for the Karabakh enclave to be united with that country, despite it being behind the borders of Azerbaijan. With a population that was 75 percent Armenian, official petitions were sent by Armenian leaders to the Soviet government in Moscow in order to address the issue but were rejected by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The demands to annex the region came in the middle of Gorbachev's reform policies, Glasnost and Perestroika. First implemented in 1985, when Gorbachev came into power, the liberalization of political and economical constraints in the Soviet Union gave birth to numerous nationalist groups in the different Soviet republics who insisted that they be given the right to secede and form their own independent countries.De Waal. Black Garden, p. 39. By late 1989, the Communist Parties of the republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been weakened in power. In Nagorno- Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms.Kaufman, Stuart. Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War. New York: Cornell Studies in Security Affairs, 2001, pp. 49‚Äì66. Gorbachev's policies hastened the collapse of the Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.Smith, Hedrick. The New Russians. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991, pp. 344‚Äì345. . Foreseeing the inevitable conflict that would unfold after the Soviet Union disintegrated, Armenian volunteers from both the Republic and the Armenian diaspora flocked to the enclave and formed detachments of several dozen men. Gorbachev deemed these detachments and others in Karabakh as illegal entities and banned them in a decree in July 1990.Croissant, Michael P. The Armenia- Azerbaijan Conflict: Causes and Implications. London: Praeger, 1998. p. 41. . Despite this promulgation, these groups continued to exist and actively fought against Azerbaijani \\"special-purpose\\" militia brigades.Croissant. The Armenia- Azerbaijan Conflict, p. 41. The volatility of the attacks led the Soviet government to position military units in the Armenian capital of Yerevan and along the five-kilometer gap between the Armenian border and Nagorno-Karabakh. Shahumyan had a population of about 20,000, of whom 85 percent were ethnic Armenian.Melkonian, Markar. My Brother's Road: An American's Fateful Journey to Armenia. New York: I. B. Tauris, 2005. p. 186 While the Armenian volunteers pledged to defend and protect civilians living in Shahumyan from Azerbaijani incursions, many of them were told to stay away by the inhabitants themselves to save the villages and the entire district from violence.Melkonian. My Brother's Road, p. 185. Origins of planning An article on the operation appearing in the 12 May Event Commentary section of Moskovskiye Novosti It is widely believed that Operation Ring was conceived by Soviet authorities in order to intimidate the Armenians.

In 1991, Gorbachev set 17 March as the date of the All-Union referendum that the republics would take part in to decide the fate of the Soviet Union.Walker, Mark.

Offering to grant greater autonomy to the individual republics, Armenia, Georgia, along with several other republics, vowed not to take part in the referendum and instead seek independence from Moscow.Croissant. The Armenia- Azerbaijan Conflict, p. 40 Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Communist Party head, Ayaz Mutalibov, continued to support Gorbachev's attempts to keep the Union together and took part in the referendum; with 92 percent of voters agreeing to remain a part of the Soviet Union. Mutalibov's staunch loyalty to Gorbachev allowed him to garner backing from Moscow and, in effect, he now had the support to discourage the aspirations of Armenians desiring to unite with Armenia or to force them to leave the region altogether.Z√ºrcher, Christoph and Jan Koehler. Potentials of Disorder: Explaining Conflict and Stability in the Caucasus and in the Former Yugoslavia. Oxford: Manchester University Press, 2003 p. 158. . The operation's codename, Ring, referred to the encirclement of the towns of Getashen and Martunashen by the Soviet MVD and armed forces. A date in late April was chosen for the commencement of the operation, which called for Soviet troops to surround the towns and search the villages for both illegally procured weapons and Armenian guerrilla fighters. Reacting to the growing violence, Gorbachev had also assigned units of the Soviet 4th Army's predominantly Azerbaijani 23rd Motorized Rifle Division, stationed along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, to serve as a buffer force. The 23rd Division and other elements of the Fourth Army were selected along with the Azerbaijani OMON to take part in Ring.De Waal. Black Garden, pp. 114‚Äì118. Implementation First operation Gandzasar was also targeted by Soviet forces as a purported weapons storage location; a sympathetic Russian officer, however, declined to carry out the search. On 30 April, the Soviet troops and OMON converged toward Getashen and Martunashen, which were approximately twenty-five kilometers north of Karabakh, meeting little, if any, resistance on the way. Accompanying the normal ground troops were an assortment of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery and attack helicopters. While approaching the villages in Shahumyan, the military would announce their intended actions with a loudspeaker and called for the inhabitants to display proof of their citizenship (known as a \\"passport-regime\\" check) in an effort to root out the fedayeen groups led by Tatul Krpeyan, a local schoolteacher. The following ultimatum was issued to residents in a village in Shahumyan: However, this served only as a pretext as civilians were subjected to grueling interrogations and many were taken out of their homes and beaten.Croissant. The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict, pp. 41‚Äì42 The troops also arrested several adult males, often without any conclusive evidence, who they accused of being members of the militia.Helsinki Watch. Bloodshed in the Caucasus: Escalation of the Armed Conflict of Nagorno-Karabakh. New York: Helsinki Watch, September 1992 p. 9 Additionally, if there was no response by the villagers to the ultimatum issued by the troops, an artillery barrage was launched above and over the village itself to further intimidate the civilians.De Waal. Black Garden, p. 117. After Soviet units completed the operation in the towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting.Sneider, Daniel. \\"Armenians and Azerbaijanis Clash in Two Soviet Villages.\\" The Christian Science Monitor. 7 May 1991. Retrieved 2 November 2006. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence carried out by the army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May. Second operation A Mil Mi-24 helicopter circling above the Shahumyan region during the first operation. On 7 May, a second operation was conducted by the same units, this time in the northern Armenian town of Voskepar. Under the same pretext as the previous operation, the joint forces entered Armenia with tanks and other armored vehicles, claiming that militia units were staging attacks from that area into Azerbaijan.Croissant. The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict, p. 42. The operation was conducted in a similar manner but with deadlier results. In addition to the arbitrary arrests of twenty men in towns surrounding Voskepar, a bus carrying thirty Armenian policemen was attacked by elements of the 23rd Division, killing eleven of the officers and arresting the rest. The OMON units also took part in razing and looting the outlying villages around Voskepar.Murphy. \\"Black Berets in Azerbaijan,\\" p. 91. Residents were similarly forced to leave their homes and thus ceded them after signing a form which stated that they were leaving their homes at their own volition. The second operation provoked further anger from the Armenian government, which saw the operation as an encroachment against its sovereignty. Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan claimed that the Soviet government was exacting retribution against his country for not taking part in the All-Union referendum by depopulating the towns. Reacting to media reports of unprovoked atrocities by the OMON, four members of the Russian parliament intervened on behalf of the Armenians, arriving in Voskepar on 15 May.Dahlburg, John-Thor. \\"Pro-Moscow Troops Seize 3 Armenian Villages.\\" Los Angeles Times. 8 May 1991. Retrieved 3 November 2006. Anatoly Shabad, the leading parliamentary member, secured the return of the captured Armenian policemen as the Soviet forces desisted from continuing out the rest of the operation. In total, five thousand Armenians were deported from Getashen and Martunashen, with an estimated 20 or 30 of them killed.De Waal. Black Garden, p. 118. Krpeyan was killed in fighting with Soviet troops in Getashen. After the events in Chaikend and Martunashen residents of 17 settlements of Hadrut and Shushi districts of Nagorno-Karabakh were deported. Human Rights organization Memorial gives the following description of the events. Human rights abuses and legality Human rights organizations documented a wide number of human rights violations and abuses committed by Soviet and Azerbaijani forces.

Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or to punish the perpetrators. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.Melkonian. My Brother's Road, p. 186.

According to the US Department of State report, Aftermath On 4 July, Gorbachev declared that the region was stabilizing, and announced an end to the operation. In both military and strategic terms, Operation Ring was a failure. The aim of disarming the Armenian volunteer groups was never achieved. Despite the presence of helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, the militiamen managed to elude and evade capture. Ring, however, managed to reinforce the ethnic divide between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, \\"virtually precluding,\\" according to Michael Croissant \\"the possibility of further coexistence between the peoples within\\" Azerbaijan's borders. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials maintained that Ring was necessary to prevent the region from further deteriorating into chaos and as the militias' presence contravened the July 1990 presidential decree. According to Shabad, however, the operation's objectives were impractical and Gorbachev had been misled on the general situation in Karabakh: Armenia fiercely contested the legality of the operation and within two months declared its independence and seceded from the Soviet Union. Within several months, the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia would worsen and precipitate the open-phased segment of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In popular culture A series of documentary films titled \\"Wounds of Karabakh\\" (1994) were shot by Bulgarian journalist Tsvetana Paskaleva.

The group was founded in 2002 and is named for Oakley Hall, an American novelist. The group's songs combine elements of rock, bluegrass, and old-time music, prominently featuring the male-female vocal harmonies of lead vocalists Patrick Sullivan and Rachel Cox. Rather than imitating the style of commercial country or bluegrass, the group's melodies more closely recall old American folk songs and ballads, though often supported by a driving rock beat. In addition to the typical guitars, bass guitar, and drums, the group also features an electrified violin, an electric guitar tuned like a five-string banjo, and a lap steel guitar. History Although based in New York, most of the group's members are not originally from that state: Patrick Sullivan is from New England, Rachel Cox is from North Carolina, Jesse Barnes is from Maryland, Fred Wallace is from Mississippi, Claudia Mogel is from New York, and Greg Anderson is from Florida. Sullivan is a former member of Oneida. The above line-up was established in November 2004. Shortly after releasing the group's first album in 2005 their label Bulb Records went out of business, delaying the release of the second album Second Guessing. This led to only a brief pause between it and the release of their third effort, Gypsum Strings in 2006. Released on Oneida's label Brah Records, a subsidiary of Jagjaguwar, this was their first record to gain wide distribution, and the band toured extensively to support it in the United States, Canada, and Europe. In the spring of 2007 they toured alongside Bright Eyes, and signed to Merge Records. The fourth album, I'll Follow You, was released in September 2007. In August 2007, drummer Greg Anderson was replaced by Pat Wood. In late 2007, while on tour with Cake, the band temporarily reduced to a quartet as Wallace and Mogel took a break. In January 2008 Ezra Oklan took over on drums. In January 2008 the band performed \\"She Belongs to Me\\" as part of The Royal Albert Hall Project ‚Äì the inaugural show of the 2008 New York Guitar Festival in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center in NYC.

He was also a scholar of Arab descent, originating from Ta'if in the Hejaz.  Genealogy  Sultan Sharif Ali was a descendant of Imam Hassan ibn Ali. In addition, Sharif Ali served as the Emir of Mecca, and was entitled \\"Al-Amƒ´r Sharƒ´f ‚ÄòAlƒ´ bin Sharƒ´f ‚ÄòAjlƒÅn bin Sharƒ´f Rumaithah bin Sharƒ´f Muhammad Ab≈´ NumƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ Al-Awwal\\" (). Sultan Sharif Ali was the ancestor of the Brunei and Sulu royal families.  Reign   Accession to the Sultanate  He ascended the throne in 1425 CE, after Sultan Ahmad died without leaving any male descendants. However, the inauguration of Sharif ‚ÄòAli did not solely come from the royal family of Sultan Ahmad. Both Brunei citizens and royal counselors agreed that Sharif Ali be the Sultan, because of his deep knowledge in Islam. His merit in spreading Islam was related to his position as a royal ‚ÄòƒÅlim (, 'scholar') in Brunei, during the reign of Sultan Ahmad. For that reason, his marriage to Puteri Ratna Kesuma, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad, was aimed at strengthening his position as a Sultan and scholar. He was the first Sultan of Brunei with no genealogical relation to former Sultans of the Kingdom.  Activities  Sharif Ali governed Brunei according to Islamic principles, and was therefore considered as a very pious ruler. Due to his popularity, he was nicknamed \\"Sultan Berkat.\\" He was the first sultan to build a Masjid, and fortified the defense of Brunei by ordering his people to build a stone fortress and town, that is Kota Batu. After his death in 1432, he was succeeded by his son Sulaiman.  Legacy  The tomb of Sultan Sharif Ali, near Kota Batu, Brunei. Sultan Sharif Ali made several changes closely linked to Islamic Law, including basing the administration's rule on the law, straightening the direction of the Qiblah (), and creating a law prohibiting people from eating pork. The penalty for violating this law was death. Besides religious affairs, Ali's administration was responsible for a number of legacies including creating an emblem and banner ‚Äì the \\"Tunggul Alam Bernaga\\" ‚Äì which symbolised the dignity of Brunei and the Crown of the Sultan. These artifacts continue to be utilized by the current Sultanate. The mausoleum of Sharif Ali is situated close to the Brunei Museum and the mausoleum of Sultan Bolkiah, the 5th Sultan of Brunei Darussalam. Sultan Sharif Ali's mausoleum was built as a tribute and recognition of his contribution to strengthening the Islamic foundations of the Sultanate. In addition to building Ali's mausoleum, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah (the 29th Sultan of Brunei) also built a grand mosque named \\"Masjid Sultan Sharif Ali,\\" as an appreciation for his contributions to Islam. The mosque, which was inaugurated in 1986, is located in Kampong Sengkurong; approximately from Bandar Seri Begawan. Several institutions in Brunei also carry Sultan Sharif Ali's name, which include Sultan Sharif Ali Secondary School in Salambigar, Jalan Muara, and Sultan Sharif Ali Islamic University. The royal symbol's origin came from the World's largest seed, which is called \\"coco de mer.\\" Family tree Source:  See also  * Far East * Greater Sunda Islands * Middle East * Sharif ul-Hashim of Sulu * Syed Abdul Rahman Alsagoff  References   External links  * Monarchy * Makam Sultan Sharif Ali * Mausoleum of Sultan Sharif Ali Category:Bruneian people of Saudi Arabian descent Category:15th-century Sultans of Brunei Category:15th-century Arabs ","title":"Sharif Ali"},{"id":"7118363","text":"Daniel Thomas Meyer (born August 3, 1952) is an American retired professional baseball player whose career spanned 17 seasons, 12 of which were played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Detroit Tigers (1974‚Äì76), the Seattle Mariners (1977‚Äì81), and the Oakland Athletics (1982‚Äì85).

During the fifth inning of a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 25, Meyer hit a home run to break up Luis Tiant's perfect game bid. One day after hitting the game-winning home run for the Tigers against the Milwaukee Brewers on May 7, Meyer committed a throwing error that let the deciding Texas Rangers' run score. He batted .236 with 56 runs scored, 111 hits, 17 doubles, three triples, eight home runs, 47 RBIs, and eight stolen bases in 122 games played during the 1975 season.

McKeough was born in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from the De La Salle Institute in 1905 and went to work in the Union Stock Yards. In 1909 he became a railroad clerk. He entered the securities industry in 1925 and was a broker from 1929 to 1934. In 1934 McKeough won the Democratic nomination for Congress from Illinois' 2nd District. He was endorsed by the Cook County Democratic Party and its chairman Patrick Nash. McKeough served four two-year terms in this position. In 1942, McKeough, already well-known statewide, decided to run for the United States Senate. His opponent in the Democratic primary was Paul Douglas, an economist and professor at the University of Chicago who had long been associated with \\"reform\\" politics. Douglas carried 99 of Illinois' 102 counties, but McKeough's Chicago-area majority was sufficient to overcome this and win the nomination. In November, however, McKeough lost to the incumbent Republican senator, Charles W. Brooks. Soon after the end of his Congressional service, McKeough went to work for the Office of Price Administration, a World War II-era federal agency charged with the enforcement of wartime wage and price controls instituted to prevent inflation. He worked for this agency until January 1944. In October 1945, he was named to the United States Maritime Commission, serving on this body until 1950. He then served on the U.S. International Claims Commission from 1951 to 1953. In 1956, he worked briefly with the Great American Oil Company. On December 3, 1956, McKeough embarked on what became his last stint in public service, as an assistant state's attorney. He held this position for exactly four years, retiring on December 3, 1960. After this he engaged in the insurance business prior to his death in Chicago in 1979.

It normally aired at 11 p.m. ET/10 p.m. CT.. History The early years When CNN went on the air on June 1, 1980 one of the first newscasts was a sports bulletin where baseball and North American Soccer League highlights were shown. Later, a nightly program called Sports Tonight went on the air in late night. During this time, Nick Charles and Fred Hickman became established as the program's co-hosts. In addition, CNN aired a weekend program called Sports Saturday and Sports Sunday. One of the program's most popular features was called \\"Play of the Day\\" (later known as the \\"Replay of the Day\\"), which showed a highlight (i.e., a spectacular play) from that day's action. The 1990s and the end In 1996, CNN launched a new station called CNN/SI. Sports Tonight was renamed CNN/Sports Illustrated, and was replayed many times throughout the night on CNN/SI, like ESPN was doing (and continues to do) with SportsCenter. The program reclaimed its Sports Tonight name shortly afterwards, and when CNN pre-empted the show in late 2000SPORTS TONIGHT Celebrates 20 Years due to the coverage of the disputed 2000 presidential election, producers decided to differentiate the format from SportsCenters highlights. Sports Tonight was relaunched in 2001 with a sports talk format, where viewers interacted with the hosts via the Internet and toll-free phone lines about their favorite teams and players. By then, Charles was no longer hosting; Hickman and Vince Cellini were the program's hosts. Sports Tonight continued on both CNN and CNN/SI until September 2001. When the terrorist attacks occurred on September 11, 2001,Unfortunately, due to the recent news events, Sports Tonight will no longer air on CNN. CNN went to all- news programming.CNN eliminates sports show from lineup Three days later, CNN announced that the program would no longer air on CNN,CNN Drops ‚ÄúSports Tonight,‚Äù Plans To Focus More On News but remain on CNN/SI. In May 2002, CNN/SI shut down operations,CNN/SI signed off with anchors thanking viewers and repeated the same edition of Sports Tonight until midnight, when the channel showed a blue screen with the message, \\"The owners of CNN/SI have stopped production of the network, and we regret that we can no longer provide it to you.\\" and Sports Tonight ended after a 21-year run.

The neighborhood is sandwiched between the Port of Tanjung Priok to the west and River Titram to the east. Cilincing was made one of the subdistrict of North Jakarta, encompassing a huge area which includes Marunda and the non-coastal hinterland. The name Cilincing is possibly derived from the name of the river Ci Lincing which is the stream that flows south to north in this area. Ci is a Sundanese word for \\"river\\". Cilincing is the name for the plant carambola.Fillet 1883 :292https://www.scribd.com/doc/6516621/Asal- Usul-Nama-Tempat-Di-Jakarta  Government  As a Subdistrict (Indonesian kecamatan), Cilincing area is much larger than the historic Cilincing, and include the coastal neighborhood of Marunda and the more inland neighborhood of Tugu. Cilincing Subdistrict is the northeasternmost subdistrict of Jakarta. A large area of Cilincing Subdistrict is allotted for agriculture and industry. Cakung Drain, part of Jakarta's flood canal, flows through Cilincing Subdistrict to Jakarta Bay. Cilincing Subdistrict is divided into seven Administrative Villages (kelurahan): *Kali Baru ‚Äì area code 14110 *Cilincing ‚Äì area code 14120 *Semper Barat ‚Äì area code 14130 *Semper Timur ‚Äì area code 14130 *Sukapura ‚Äì area code 14140 *Rorotan ‚Äì area code 14140 *Marunda ‚Äì area code 14150  History   Early development  During the early colonial period, Cilincing (older spelling Tji Lintjing) was a name of a coastal area located around 7 km east of the cape of Priok (Malay Tanjong Priok). The land of Cilincing were dotted with fish ponds, similar with Ancol but less marshy, allowing early settlements to grow. The coast of Cilincing contained a shell- rich beach and among few places in Java which contains the species of cemara laut (\\"sea pine\\"). In late 18th-century, four manor houses (landhuizen) were established by the Dutch, from west to east: Tanjong Priok house belonging to De heer van Riemsdyk, Pajonkoran house (also Jonkoraan) to Richold ter Schegget, Bangliauw house (variously written as Bangleu or Bank Loeau) to Paul Bergman, and the easternmost and the most imposing of all Cilincing mansion belonging to Johannes Christoffel Schultz. These mansions were connected to the walled city of Batavia through the Vaart canal (possibly a pre-Dutch canal) and then to Ancol canal, which was then connected to the outer canal of the walled city of Batavia. The Cilincing mansion, located roughly in what is now the kecamatan office of Cilincing Subdistrict, was the administration center of the early settlements in Cilincing. A Tuesday market was established to the north of Cilincing mansion. The mansion was strategically located, being the point where the traffic from the Vaart canal connects with the road to the plantation area to the south. One of the settlement of the southern plantation is the Portuguese Tugu settlement, among the oldest settlement in Jakarta.  Seaside resorts of Cilincing (19th-century ‚Äì 1970s)  Palm Beach Cilincing in the 1940s, a popular beach area in Cilincing. The beach no longer exist. Beginning in the late 19th-century, the seaside area of Cilincing started to become a popular seaside recreation area. Dutch people and natives alike flocked to the seaside of Cilincing to enjoy the pristine water or to have a picnic. One popular resort was the Palm Beach Cilincing which was supported with recreational facilities such as eating places and bathing areas. The popularity of Cilincing as a seaside resort continued to the 20th-century. Another popular seaside resort of Cilincing in the 1950s was the Sindang Laut on the western edge of Cilincing near the Port of Tanjung Priok. Sindang Laut was equipped with restaurant, playground, and berths for small boats. Sindang Laut has been demolished, the area converted into industrial port area, and is now Bogasari Flour Mills.  Industrial and slum area (post 1980s)  Cilincing and its surrounding area continued its popularity as seaside resort until the 1970s. The beginning of the 1980s saw the decline of Cilincing's popularity, mainly caused by the expansion of the Port of Tanjung Priok plus increasing pollution along the north coast of Java. The success of the reclamation of the seaside part of Ancol into Ancol Dreamland resort in 1962 prompted President Suharto to start another reclamation project, the Pantai Mutiara and the Pantai Indah Kapuk project; the land fill for Pantai Indah Kapuk project was dredged from Palm Beach Cilincing. With the shift of Jakarta's seaside resort toward Ancol, Pantai Indah Kapuk, and Pantai Mutiara, Cilincing as seaside resort effectively ended.Proyek Reklamasi Jakarta: Impian Soekarno dan Soeharto?

The Guild's published mission is to be Western Australia's leading campus student representative organisation.  Background The UWA Student Guild is the premier student representative body at the University of Western Australia. The vision of the UWA Student Guild is to be Australia's leading campus student representative organisation. The Guild provides a number of services, and is instrumental in promoting and sustaining student life on campus. The Guild runs a number of activities including Prosh, Orientation Day (O-Day), End of Semester Shows and other major campus events. Guild Departments and Subsidiary Councils run other events, such as Multicultural Week and Spring Feast (run by the Multicultural Week department), Club Carnival (run by the Societies Council) and the PAC Pop-Up series of performances (run by the Public Affairs Council). The Guild also supports and assists a network of more than 180 affiliated clubs and societies on campus, catering to a very wide range of interests (religious, theatrical, cultural etc.). The Guild also runs the majority catering outlets on campus, including the Tavern, as well as a second-hand bookshop and a volunteering centre. For most of the organisation's existence, it maintained a monopoly in on-campus catering, although in 2012, the first three independent catering outlets were introduced. The Guild's Student Centre provides one-on-one academic advocacy, as well as financial counselling and interest-free loans. Guild Council is the overall governing body of the Guild and consists of 23 voting members democratically elected at the annual Guild elections. The current Guild President is Bre Shanahan, who took office on 1 December 2019. Former Guild Presidents include notable figures such as former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, former federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley and former Health Minister and Attorney General of Western Australia Jim McGinty.  Annual elections  Student representatives are elected to their positions by students in annual elections held in September. Elections are conducted by the Western Australian Electoral Commission. Both independent and party candidates run in the elections, with the historical bias leaning towards grouped members becoming elected. Elected office bearers take office as of 1 December in the year they are elected. The 2016 Elections took place from 19 to 22 September 2016, and were for the 104th Guild Council. Three parties contested the 2016 elections: STAR, Launch and Left Action. The 2019 Elections took place with changes including a fast lane outside the major polling station of Reid library, reduction in the paper allowance per candidate, a lunch hour blackout and an International Student Services Debate. Six parties contested in the 2019 elections: Star, Launch, Left Action, Global, Liberation and Progress. The election had Star winning majority of seats followed by Global with 4 seats, Launch with 3 seats and Left Action with 1 Seat.  Controversies   Racism controversy The 2013 edition of annual charity newspaper ‚ÄúProsh‚Äù caused significant controversy when a racist article, \\"dream-time horoscopes\\" lead to a public relations disaster for the Guild, with major charity beneficiary ICEA withdrawing support from the paper.The Australian  Missing money In May 2014 the Guild hired audit and tax firm BDO to investigate financial irregularities in the Guild's 2013 accounts, which found about $870,000 had been misappropriated. Based on the initial findings of that investigation, a staff member was dismissed for serious misconduct. No action was taken against Cameron Barnes, who had been president at the time of the theft.  Guild structure  The Guild is administered by a council of student representatives elected for one-year terms at the annual elections. There are twenty voting members of council, and several more non-voting members. Members may hold a voting and a non-voting role concurrently. Unlike some other campus unions, there is no financial compensation for student representatives, with the exception of the President who works at the Guild full-time during their term.

The boundaries of Koja is Jakarta Bay to the north, Laksamana Yos Sudarso Tollway to the west, Pelabuhan Minyak - Kali Baru - Kramat Jaya Road - Kali Cakung to the east, and Kali Batik to the south. History Kampung Tugu In 1641 the Dutch Republic nation took Malacca from the Portuguese. A large number of people of Portuguese descent in Malacca were evacuated to Batavia, the Dutch East India Company headquarters, as war captives, where they settled in an area called Koja or Kampung Tugu\\". During the early 18th century, a portion of land in what is now Tugu Administrative Village in Koja Subdistrict, was given to Melchior Leydekker. Melchior Leydekker was a Dutch doctor of medicine and theology who was placed in Batavia (1675), as he was at that time the son-in-law of the Governor General Abraham van Riebeeck. This new area, called Tugu, was developed as a neighborhood for the freed slaves known as Mardijker people. This area, now called Kampung Tugu, is the oldest Christian neighborhood in the west of Indonesia. Several buildings in this neighborhood dates back to the 17th century, such as the Tugu Church, thought to be built between 1676-1678.http://blog.londoh.com/?amount=0&blogid;=1&query;=tugu The neighborhood still exists today, and retains its own distinct culture characteristic of Jakarta, such as the Portuguese-influenced musical style Kroncong Tugu spoken in the extinct Papia Tugu language.http://www.wisatapesisir.com/id/kampung-tugu Kramat Tunggak red- light district In 1972, a red-light district known as Kramat Tunggak (abbreviated as Kramtung) was established in Tugu Utara Administrative Village under then-Jakarta Governor Ali Sadikin's policy to \\"localize\\" prostitutes in the area into a single complex. Covering an area of 109,435 m2, the complex faced opposition from the local Muslim community. The complex provided work for about 3,000 prostitutes and provided health checks, clinics and condoms.

At the time of the closing, the complex contained 277 brothels, with 1,615 prostitutes under the supervision of 258 brothel keepers. Some of the sex workers were later provided with training for new jobs, but many simply moved to plying their trade on the streets or to brothels a few kilometers to the north. In 2002, an Islamic learning center called Jakarta Islamic Center (JIC) was established on the site of the former red-light district.

He was an author, song composer, and linguist, and made a significant contribution towards the emancipation of women in Indian society during the British Raj.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, 1976/1998, pp. 554‚Äì5, Sahitya Sansad, .Bandopadhyay, Hiranmay, Thakurbarir Katha, pp. 98‚Äì104, Sishu Sahitya Sansad . He was the second eldest brother of Rabindranath Tagore, the only Indian to get a Nobel Prize in Literature. Formative years The second son of Debendranath Tagore, the elder brother of Rabindranath Tagore and grandson of Dwarkanath Tagore of the Jorasanko branch of the Tagore family of Calcutta (now Kolkata), he learnt Sanskrit and English at home. A student of Hindu School, he was part of the first batch of students to appear for the entrance examinations of the University of Calcutta in 1857. He was placed in the first division and was admitted to Presidency College. As was the custom of the day, he was married early in life to Jnanadanandini Devi in 1859. The same year, he and Keshub Chunder Sen accompanied his father on a visit to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).Sastri, Sivanath, History of the Brahmo Samaj, 1911‚Äì12/1993, p. 80, Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. Civil service The East India Company had administered its holdings through \\"covenanted servants\\". Aspirants had to be nominated by a director of the Company, sign a \\"covenant of indenture\\" employment contract, and furnish a bond backed by two guarantors. For a long time, applicants also had to be British, but in the mid-nineteenth century some posts were opened to Indians, and a competitive examination was introduced for recruits. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, administration passed to the Indian Civil Service (ICS), established in 1861. The ICS continued the system of competitive examination. It was a daunting task to go to England and compete with the British for a position. However, his friend Monomohun Ghose offered encouragement and support, and both of them set sail for England in 1862 to prepare for and compete in the civil service examinations. Satyendranath was selected for the Indian Civil Service in June, 1863. He completed his probationary training and returned to India in November 1864. Monomohun Ghose did not succeed in the examination for the ICS but was called to the bar.Devi Choudhurani, Indira, Smritisamput, Rabindrabhaban, Viswabharati, p. 187 . Satyendranath was posted to Bombay presidency, which then covered western parts of present-day Maharashtra, Gujarat and Sindh. After initial posting of four months in Bombay (now Mumbai), he had his first active posting at Ahmedabad. With postings at numerous towns, he travelled across the country. Owing to his long stay away from home, his family members visited him and stayed with him for long periods. Amongst his regular visitors were his younger brothers Jyotirindranath and Rabindranath, and his sister Swarnakumari Devi. His posting outside Bengal helped him to learn several Indian languages. He translated Bal Gangadhar Tilak‚Äôs Geetarahasya and Tukaram‚Äôs Abhang poems into Bengali. Rabindranath Tagore had also translated some poems of Tukaram. Satyendranath took an active interest in the activities of the Brahmo Samaj wherever he was posted, e.g. Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.Sastri, Sivanath, History of the Brahmo Samaj, pp. 468, 531. While in the Maharashtra region he had close contacts with many of the leading reformers and Prarthana Samaj figures ‚Äî Mahadev Govind Ranade, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and Narayan Ganesh Chandavarkar.Devi Choudhurani, Indira, p. 57. In 1882, Satyendranath was a district judge in Karwar, Karnataka. He served in the ICS for about thirty years and retired as Judge of Satara in Maharashtra in 1897.Devi Choudhurani, Indira, pp. 1‚Äì2. Women's emancipation Ram Mohan Roy found women of Bengal \\"uneducated and illiterate, deprived of property rights, married before puberty, imprisoned in purdah,Purdah was a system wherein women were not allowed to come out in the open in front of other men. It effectively meant that they had to live entirely inside the house all their lives. and murdered at widowhood by a barbaric custom of immolation known as sati.\\" By the time Satyendranath was born sati had been banned (in 1829), and the process of reformation had set in. The position of women in his society troubled him from a young age. He used to think that the purdah system in his family was ‚Äònot that of our own nation but a copy of Muslim practices‚Äô. His visit to England where he witnessed more freedom for women helped him understand the relatively poor position of women in Indian society. After his marriage, he found in Jnanadanandini Devi an ideal partner to fulfill his thinking. When he was thrilled to witness the progress of women in the advanced society in England, he wanted to take her to England to witness the same, but his father, Debendranath Tagore, stood in the way. Back in India, Satyendranath took Jnanadanandini Devi to Bombay, where she tried to live in the manner and style of the wives of the English officers of the ICS. When the couple returned to the ancestral home at Jorasanko for a holiday, they created a sensation in Calcutta society. They were invited to a party in the Government House (now Raj Bhavan). Breaking all traditional rules, Jnanadanandini Devi accompanied her husband to the party. There she was ‚Äì \\"a lone Bengali woman in the midst of hundreds of English women.\\" Prasanna Coomar Tagore of the Pathuriaghata branch of the Tagore family, who was present in the party, could not bear the sight of a wife of a family member in such an open place and left immediately \\"in shame and anger\\". In 1877, he sent Jnanadanandini Devi, accompanied by an English couple, to England. She went with three children, a daring task in those days. They initially stayed with the family of Prasanna Coomar Tagore's son Gnanendramohan Tagore, who had converted to Christianity and was the first Indian to qualify for the English bar. Later they shifted to Brighton and lived on their own there. Subsequently, Satyendranath accompanied Rabindranath in what was the latter's first visit to England. All of them returned to India in 1880. It was not only with his wife, but also his sisters that he took the lead to change things. His sister Soudamini Devi wrote, ‚ÄòThe mocking we faced when we went out in the carriages is difficult to believe now.\\" Thus were laid the foundations of freeing the upper and middle-class women from the purdah. It was a major achievement of Satyendranath Tagore. Jnanadanandini Devi too contributed in her own ways. As she had to go out in society, she developed a style of wearing the sari, which is broadly followed by Indian women today. She also introduced the use of proper undergarments. Jnanadanandini Devi took special interest in children's matters and started the system of observing birthdays of children in the family, giving them gifts and celebrating the occasion. She started and edited a magazine named Balak for children in 1885. It was possibly the first magazine for children in the Bengali language. The magazine motivated Rabindranath to write for children. Many of the pieces included in his book Sishu were first published in Balak. The magazine was wound up after a year and merged with the family magazine Bharati.Bandopadhyay, Hiranmay, p. 219 Other activities Patriotism The Tagore family were strong Indian patriots. In an age when it was de rigueur to imitate Western dress habits and to speak the English language in Indian high society, the Tagores kept Indian dress and chose to cultivate Bengali. While admiring the positive qualities he considered British society to possess, Satyendranath himself took the view it was necessary to reform and cultivate the Indian society which already existed. He was one of the people associated with the Hindu Mela, whose purpose was to awaken this sense of patriotism in the lives of ordinary Indians. When the first session was held in April 1867, he was away in western India. However, he was present in Calcutta for the second session in 1868. He composed the song mile sabe Bharat santan, ektan gaho gaan (unite, India's children, sing in unison) for the occasion, which was hailed as the first national anthem of India. He wrote a number of other such patriotic songs. Brahmo Samaj Satyendranath had deep regard for his father Debendranath and the religion he had taken so much pain to develop. At a considerably young age, he and Monomohun Ghose accompanied Keshub Chunder Sen on his campaign to win over the younger generation at Krishnanagar College.Kopf, David, p. 258. In England, even when he was busy with other work, he found time to preach the ideals of Brahmo Samaj. Later, when he was posted in Ahmedabad, he sent a report about Brahmo Samaj to Max M√ºller. It was included in M√ºller's biography, written by his wife. Socio-literary activities On retirement, he lived for some time in Park Street and then in Ballygunj in Calcutta. His house was a meeting place for his friends and relatives. Amongst those from outside the family who visited him regularly were Taraknath Palit, Monomohun Ghose, Satyendraprasanna Sinha, Umesh Bannerjee, Krishna Govinda Gupta, and Behari Lal Gupta, all people of considerable standing in Kolkata's society then. His house on Park Street was the centre of a literary majlis (gathering). Some of the subjects discussed were \\"The Bengali language and the Bengali character\\", \\"The elements of poetry\\", \\"Chivalry\\", and \\"Love in women and in men\\". Deliberations among the participants were recorded in a book which was not to be published and not to be circulated outside the family. He was president of Vangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1900‚Äì01, and presided over the 10th session of the Bengal provincial conference held at Natore in 1897.

Children Both his children, Surendranath Tagore (1872‚Äì1940) and Indira Devi Choudhurani (1873‚Äì1960), were well-known figures. They had the experience of English life as children. Surendranath had great command over English and had translated Rabindranath's Four Chapters into that language. He had produced a condensed version of the main portion of Mahabharata in Bengali. In his time, he had links with militant revolutionary organisations fighting for Indian independence from the British, which were considered terrorists by the British establishment.Deb, Chitra, Jorasanko and the Thakur Family, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 65, Oxford University Press, . Indira was a great French scholar and was an authority on music, particularly Rabindrasangeet. She was vice- chancellor of Viswa Bharati University. She was married to Pramatha Chowdhury, the noted Bengali author. Supriyo Tagore, the longest serving principal of Santiniketan Patha Bhavan, is one of his great-grandsons and Ishita Das, a principal of the Calcutta Patha Bhavan, is one of his great-granddaughters.

Kelapa Gading neighborhood is known to the local populates as a city within a city, due to the integrated residential-commercial planning, and the supporting facilities. Kelapa Gading is also the name of a district. History Kelapa Gading was an undeveloped marshland and sparsed agricultural land until 1976, when a local real estate developer company, PT Summarecon Agung, developed Kelapa Gading into a more productive land by establishing an integrated residential-commercial area in a grid-like urban planning with main boulevards and supporting facilities including schools and hospitals. Government As a district (Indonesian kecamatan), Kelapa Gading is the southernmost district of North Jakarta. Kelapa Gading has a total area of . The district is bounded by Bekasi Raya - Perintis Kemerdekaan Road to the south, Sunter Canal to the west, Bendungan Batik Canal to the north, and Cakung - Petukangan River to the east. Kelapa Gading is divided into 3 kelurahan (administrative villages): *Kelapa Gading Barat - area code 14240 *Kelapa Gading Timur - area code 14240 *Pegangsaan Dua - area code 14250 Residential Kelapa Gading as a residential area is generally targeted toward the middle to upper market, though there are exceptions with non-gated residences. Artha Gading Villa and Kuta residence in Bukit Gading Villa are up-market areas in the location. The prime location and luxury contribute to the price factor. About 65% of the residents of Kelapa Gading are Chinese Indonesians.Since the late 1990s, vertical residences started to be built in Kelapa Gading. Starting from Kondominium Menara Kelapa Gading on the east gate, Wisma Gading Permai, to Gading Mediterranean Residences. After that, more apartment buildings continued to fill Kelapa Gading. Commercial In Jakarta, Kelapa Gading is famous amongst food lovers as varieties of Indonesian food like Chinese food, Minang food and Javanese food, as well as non-Indonesian cuisine such as Thai, Japanese and Western foods. The central point in Kelapa Gading is an area known as Gading Food City . The Jakarta Fashion & Food Festival is annually held in several locations of this area. The district of Kelapa Gading contains multiple shopping malls within a 20 kilometer radius. Some of the well-known malls in the district include Mal Kelapa Gading (the first and the largest shopping mall in Kelapa Gading, opened in 1990 by PT Summarecon Agung), Mal Artha Gading, Kelapa Gading Trade Center, Bella Terra, and Mall of Indonesia. Kelapa Gading has several bars and entertainment places that open up until late night. People in Kelapa Gading usually hang out to various types of bar: Korean Soju bars such as Oppa House of Soju and Hangover, famous night bars with cozy architectural designs such as District Bar & Resto that offers a wide range of local to International cuisines and Holywings that is famous for its Korean foods especially the chicken wings, both places offer varieties of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. Youngsters also enjoy the local karaokes such as Happy Puppy Karaoke or NAV Karaoke. Kelapa Gading is also known as the world's capital of Bakmi (meat noodle) as there is a large variety of Bakmi noodles that can be found, such as noodles from Bangka, Makassar, Pontianak, Japanese ramen, Korean- styled noodles, and others. . Flooding problem Despite being a well- developed area, Kelapa Gading is affected by flood most rainy season due to its geographically low plain characteristics (5 meters above sea level) and the lack of effective flood diversion network established by the district developer. The district was severely affected by the 2007 Jakarta flood, the worst flooding disaster in Jakarta. Flood control infrastructures in Kelapa Gading include several small reservoirs in the Administrative Village of Kelapa Gading Barat, with linking water channels. Since 2010, the East Flood Channel began functioning, diverting water that used to cross Kelapa Gading's surrounding waterway. Many are hoping that this Flood Channel can really make Kelapa Gading flood free. Between 2008 and 2011, no crucial flood struck the area. In 2020, however, the area has been overwhelmed with multiple floods. Education *North Jakarta Intercultural School is located in Kelapa Gading.\\"Contact Us.\\" North Jakarta Intercultural School.

From the lower left, fear increases in the upward direction and aggression increases to the right. Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses of individuals or groups of domestic dogs to internal and external stimuli. It has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans and their lifestyles. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned in these fellow mammals. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a wide range of social- cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. Co-evolution with humans The origin of the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is not clear. Whole-genome sequencing indicates that the dog, the gray wolf and the extinct Taymyr wolf diverged around the same time 27,000‚Äì40,000 years ago. How dogs became domesticated is not clear, however the two main hypotheses are self-domestication or human domestication. There exists evidence of human- canine behavioral coevolution. Intelligence Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge in order to solve problems. Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately. He also retained this ability four weeks after the initial exposure. Dogs have advanced memory skills. A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, \\"Chaser\\", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. Senses The dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, taste, touch, proprioception, and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Communication behavior Dog communication is about how dogs \\"speak\\" to each other, how they understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit. These communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste). Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. Dogs can also learn to understand communication of emotions with humans by reading human facial expressions. Social behavior Two studies have indicated that dog behavior varied with their size, body weight and skull size. Play Dog-dog Play between dogs usually involves several behaviors that are often seen in aggressive encounters, for example, nipping, biting and growling. It is therefore important for the dogs to place these behaviors in the context of play, rather than aggression. Dogs signal their intent to play with a range of behaviors including a \\"play-bow\\", \\"face-paw,\\" \\"open-mouthed play face\\" and postures inviting the other dog to chase the initiator. Similar signals are given throughout the play to maintain the context of the potentially aggressive activities. From a young age, dogs engage in play with one another. Dog play is made up primarily of mock fights. It is believed that this behavior, which is most common in puppies, is training for important behaviors later in life. Play between puppies is not necessarily a 50:50 symmetry of dominant and submissive roles between the individuals; dogs who engage in greater rates of dominant behaviors (e.g. chasing, forcing partners down) at later ages also initiate play at higher rates. This could imply that winning during play becomes more important as puppies mature. Emotional contagion is linked to facial mimicry in humans and primates. Facial mimicry is an automatic response that occurs in less than 1 second in which one person involuntary mimics another person's facial expressions, forming empathy. It has also been found in dogs at play, and play sessions lasted longer when there were facial mimicry signals from one dog to another. Dog-human NASA astronaut Leland D. Melvin with his dogs Jake and Scout The motivation for a dog to play with another dog is distinct from that of a dog playing with a human. Dogs walked together with opportunities to play with one another, play with their owners with the same frequency as dogs being walked alone. Dogs in households with two or more dogs play more often with their owners than dogs in households with a single dog, indicating the motivation to play with other dogs does not substitute for the motivation to play with humans. It is a common misconception that winning and losing games such as \\"tug-of-war\\" and \\"rough-and-tumble\\" can influence a dog's dominance relationship with humans. Rather, the way in which dogs play indicates their temperament and relationship with their owner. Dogs that play rough-and-tumble are more amenable and show lower separation anxiety than dogs which play other types of games, and dogs playing tug-of-war and \\"fetch\\" are more confident. Dogs which start the majority of games are less amenable and more likely to be aggressive. Playing with humans can affect the cortisol levels of dogs. In one study, the cortisol responses of police dogs and border guard dogs was assessed after playing with their handlers. The cortisol concentrations of the police dogs increased, whereas the border guard dogs' hormone levels decreased. The researchers noted that during the play sessions, police officers were disciplining their dogs, whereas the border guards were truly playing with them, i.e. this included bonding and affectionate behaviors. They commented that several studies have shown that behaviors associated with control, authority or aggression increase cortisol, whereas play and affiliation behavior decrease cortisol levels. Empathy In 2012, a study found that dogs oriented toward their owner or a stranger more often when the person was pretending to cry than when they were talking or humming. When the stranger pretended to cry, rather than approaching their usual source of comfort, their owner, dogs sniffed, nuzzled and licked the stranger instead. The dogs' pattern of response was behaviorally consistent with an expression of empathic concern. A study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when separated from others. Personalities The term personality has been applied to human research, whereas the term temperament has been mostly used for animal research. However, both terms have been used interchangeably in the literature, or purely to distinguish humans from animals and avoid anthropomorphism. Personality can be defined as ‚Äúa set of behaviors that are consistent over context and time‚Äù. Studies of dogs' personalities have tried to identify the presence of broad personality traits that are stable and consistent over time. There are different approaches to assess dog personality: :* Ratings of individual dogs: either a caretaker or a dog expert who is familiar with the dog is asked to answer a questionnaire, for instance the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire, concerning how often the dog shows certain types of behavior. :* Tests: the dog is submitted to a set of tests and its reactions are evaluated on a behavioral scale. For instance, the dog is presented to a familiar and then an unfamiliar person in order to measure sociability or aggression. :* Observational test: The dog‚Äôs behavior is evaluated in a selected but not controlled environment. An observer focuses on the dog‚Äôs reactions to naturally occurring stimuli. For example, a walk through the supermarket can allow the observer to see the dog in various types of conditions (crowded, noisy‚Ä¶) Several potential personality traits have been identified in dogs, for instance \\"Playfulness\\", \\"Curiosity/Fearlessness, \\"Chase-proneness\\", \\"Sociability and Aggressiveness\\" and \\"Shyness‚ÄìBoldness\\". A meta-analysis of 51 published peer reviewed articles identified seven dimensions of canine personality: # Reactivity (approach or avoidance of new objects, increased activity in novel situations) # Fearfulness (shaking, avoiding novel situations) # Activity # Sociability (initiating friendly interactions with people and other dogs) # Responsiveness to training (working with people, learning quickly) # Submissiveness # Aggression Dog breed plays an important role in the dog's personality dimensions, while the effects of age and sex have not been clearly determined. The personality models can be used for a range of tasks, including guide and working dog selection, finding appropriate families to re-home shelter dogs, or selecting breeding stock. Leadership, dominance and social groups Two dogs playing follow the leader. Dominance is a descriptive term for the relationship between pairs of individuals. Among ethologists, dominance has been defined as \\"an attribute of the pattern of repeated, antagonistic interactions between two individuals, characterized by a consistent outcome in favor of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation. The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate.\\" Another definition is that a dominant animal has \\"priority of access to resources\\". Dominance is a relative attribute, not absolute; there is no reason to assume that a high-ranking individual in one group would also become high ranking if moved to another. Nor is there any good evidence that \\"dominance\\" is a lifelong character trait. Competitive behavior characterized by confident (e.g. growl, inhibited bite, stand over, stare at, chase, bark at) and submissive (e.g. crouch, avoid, displacement lick/yawn, run away) patterns exchanged. One test to ascertain in which group the dominant dog was used the following criteria: When a stranger comes to the house, which dog starts to bark first or if they start to bark together, which dog barks more or longer? Which dog licks more often the other dog's mouth? If the dogs get food at the same time and at the same spot, which dog starts to eat first or eats the other dog's food? If the dogs start to fight, which dog usually wins? Domestic dogs appear to pay little attention to relative size, despite the large weight differences between the largest and smallest individuals; for example, size was not a predictor of the outcome of encounters between dogs meeting while being exercised by their owners nor was size correlated with neutered male dogs. Therefore, many dogs do not appear to pay much attention to the actual fighting ability of their opponent, presumably allowing differences in motivation (how much the dog values the resource) and perceived motivation (what the behavior of the other dog signifies about the likelihood that it will escalate) to play a much greater role. Two dogs that are contesting possession of a highly valued resource for the first time, if one is in a state of emotional arousal, in pain; if reactivity is influenced by recent endocrine changes, or motivational states such as hunger, then the outcome of the interaction may be different than if none of these factors were present. Equally, the threshold at which aggression is shown may be influenced by a range of medical factors, or, in some cases, precipitated entirely by pathological disorders. Hence, the contextual and physiological factors present when two dogs first encounter each other may profoundly influence the long-term nature of the relationship between those dogs. The complexity of the factors involved in this type of learning means that dogs may develop different \\"expectations\\" about the likely response of another individual for each resource in a range of different situations. Puppies learn early not to challenge an older dog and this respect stays with them into adulthood. When adult animals meet for the first time, they have no expectations of the behavior of the other: they will both, therefore, be initially anxious and vigilant in this encounter (characterized by the tense body posture and sudden movements typically seen when two dogs first meet), until they start to be able to predict the responses of the other individual. The outcome of these early adult‚Äìadult interactions will be influenced by the specific factors present at the time of the initial encounters. As well as contextual and physiological factors, the previous experiences of each member of the dyad of other dogs will also influence their behavior. Scent Dogs have an olfactory sense 40 times more sensitive than a human's and they commence their lives operating almost exclusively on smell and touch. The special scents that dogs use for communication are called pheromones. Different hormones are secreted when a dog is angry, fearful or confident, and some chemical signatures identify the sex and age of the dog, and if a female is in the estrus cycle, pregnant or recently given birth. Many of the pheromone chemicals can be found dissolved in a dog's urine, and sniffing where another dog has urinated gives the dog a great deal of information about that dog. Male dogs prefer to mark vertical surfaces and having the scent higher allows the air to carry it farther. The height of the marking tells other dogs about the size of the dog, as among canines size is an important factor in dominance. Dogs (and wolves) mark their territories with urine and their stools. The anal gland of canines give a particular signature to fecal deposits and identifies the marker as well as the place where the dung is left. Dogs are very particular about these landmarks, and engage in what is to humans a meaningless and complex ritual before defecating. Most dogs start with a careful bout of sniffing of a location, perhaps to erect an exact line or boundary between their territory and another dog's territory. This behavior may also involve a small degree of elevation, such as a rock or fallen branch, to aid scent dispersal. Scratching the ground after defecating is a visual sign pointing to the scent marking. The freshness of the scent gives visitors some idea of the current status of a piece of territory and if it is used frequently. Regions under dispute, or used by different animals at different times, may lead to marking battles with every scent marked-over by a new competitor. Feral dogs Feral dogs are those dogs living in a wild state with no food and shelter intentionally provided by humans, and showing a continuous and strong avoidance of direct human contacts. In the developing world pet dogs are uncommon, but feral, village or community dogs are plentiful around humans. The distinction between feral, stray, and free ranging dogs is sometimes a matter of degree, and a dog may shift its status throughout its life. In some unlikely but observed cases, a feral dog that was not born wild but living with a feral group can become rehabilitated to a domestic dog with an owner. A dog can become a stray when it escapes human control, by abandonment or being born to a stray mother. A stray dog can become feral when forced out of the human environment or when co-opted or socially accepted by a nearby feral group. Feralization occurs through the development of a fear response to humans. Feral dogs are not reproductively self-sustaining, suffer from high rates of juvenile mortality, and depend indirectly on humans for their food, their space, and the supply of co-optable individuals. See further: behavior compared to other canids. Other behavior Dogs have a general behavioral trait of strongly preferring novelty (\\"neophillia\\") compared to familiarity. The average sleep time of a dog in captivity in a 24-hour period is 10.1 hours.\\"40 Winks?\\" Jennifer S. Holland, National Geographic Vol. 220, No. 1. July 2011. Reproduction behavior Estrous cycle and mating Although puppies do not have the urge to procreate, males sometimes engage in sexual play in the form of mounting. In some puppies, this behavior occurs as early as 3 or 4 weeks-of- age. Dogs reach sexual maturity and can reproduce during their first year, in contrast to wolves at two years-of-age. Female dogs have their first estrus (\\"heat\\") at 6 to 12 months-of-age; smaller dogs tend to come into heat earlier whereas larger dogs take longer to mature. Female dogs have an estrous cycle that is nonseasonal and monestrus, i.e. there is only one estrus per estrous cycle. The interval between one estrus and another is, on average, seven months, however, this may range between 4 and 12 months. This interestrous period is not influenced by the photoperiod or pregnancy. The average duration of estrus is 9 days with spontaneous ovulation usually about 3 days after the onset of estrus. For several days before estrus, a phase called proestrus, the female dog may show greater interest in male dogs and \\"flirt\\" with them (proceptive behavior). There is progressive vulval swelling and some bleeding. If males try to mount a female dog during proestrus, she may avoid mating by sitting down or turning round and growling or snapping. Estrous behavior in the female dog is usually indicated by her standing still with the tail held up, or to the side of the perineum, when the male sniffs the vulva and attempts to mount. This tail position is sometimes called ‚Äúflagging‚Äù. The female dog may also turn, presenting the vulva to the male. The male dog mounts the female and is able to achieve intromission with a non-erect penis, which contains a bone called the os penis. The dog's penis enlarges inside the vagina, thereby preventing its withdrawal; this is sometimes known as the \\"tie\\" or \\"copulatory lock\\". The male dog rapidly thrust into the female for 1‚Äì2 minutes then dismounts with the erect penis still inside the vagina, and turns to stand rear-end to rear-end with the female dog for up to 30 to 40 minutes; the penis is twisted 180 degrees in a lateral plane. During this time, prostatic fluid is ejaculated. The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the previous one. Dogs are polygamous in contrast to wolves that are generally monogamous. Therefore, dogs have no pair bonding and the protection of a single mate, but rather have multiple mates in a year. The consequence is that wolves put a lot of energy into producing a few pups in contrast to dogs that maximize the production of pups. This higher pup production rate enables dogs to maintain or even increase their population with a lower pup survival rate than wolves, and allows dogs a greater capacity than wolves to grow their population after a population crash or when entering a new habitat. It is proposed that these differences are an alternative breeding strategy, one adapted to a life of scavenging instead of hunting. Parenting and early life All of the wild members of the genus Canis display complex coordinated parental behaviors. Wolf pups are cared for primarily by their mother for the first 3 months of their life when she remains in the den with them while they rely on her milk for sustenance and her presence for protection. The father brings her food. Once they leave the den and can chew, the parents and pups from previous years regurgitate food for them. Wolf pups become independent by 5 to 8 months, although they often stay with their parents for years. In contrast, dog pups are cared for by the mother and rely on her for milk and protection but she gets no help from the father nor other dogs. Once pups are weaned around 10 weeks they are independent and receive no further maternal care. Behavior problems There are many different types of behavioural issues that a dog can exhibit, including growling, snapping, barking, and invading human's space. A survey of 203 dog owners in Melbourne, Australia, found that the main behaviour problems reported by owners were overexcitement (63%) and jumping up on people (56%). Some problems are related to attachment while others are neurological, as seen below. Separation anxiety When dogs are separated from humans, usually the owner, they often display behaviors which can be broken into the following four categories: exploratory behaviour, object play, destructive behaviour, and vocalization, and they are related to the canine's level of arousal. These behaviours may manifest as destructiveness, fecal or urinary elimination, hypersalivation or vocalization among other things. Dogs from single-owner homes are approximately 2.5 times more likely to have separation anxiety compared to dogs from multiple-owner homes. Furthermore, sexually intact dogs are only one third as likely to have separation anxiety as neutered dogs. The sex of dogs and whether there is another pet in the home do not have an effect on separation anxiety. It has been estimated that at least 14% of dogs examined at typical veterinary practices in the United States have shown signs of separation anxiety. Dogs that have been diagnosed with profound separation anxiety can be left alone for no more than minutes before they begin to panic and exhibit the behaviors associated with separation anxiety. Separation problems have been found to be linked to the dog's dependency on its owner, not because of disobedience. In the absence of treatment, affected dogs are often relinquished to a humane society or shelter, abandoned, or euthanized. Resource guarding Resource guarding is exhibited by many canines, and is one of the most commonly reported behaviour issues to canine professionals. It is seen when a dog uses specific behaviour patterns so that they can control access to an item, and the patterns are flexible when people are around. If a canine places value on some resource (i.e. food, toys, etc.) they may attempt to guard it from other animals as well as people, which leads to behavioural problems if not treated. The guarding can show in many different ways from rapid ingestion of food to using the body to shield items. It manifests as aggressive behaviour including, but not limited to, growling, barking, or snapping. Some dogs will also resource guard their owners and can become aggressive if the behaviour is allowed to continue. Owners must learn to interpret their dog's body language in order to try to judge the dog's reaction, as visual signals are used (i.e. changes in body posture, facial expression, etc.) to communicate feeling and response. These behaviours are commonly seen in shelter animals, most likely due to insecurities caused by a poor environment. Resource guarding is a concern since it can lead to aggression, but research has found that aggression over guarding can be contained by teaching the dog to drop the item they are guarding. Noise anxiety  Canines often fear, and exhibit stress responses to, loud noises. Noise-related anxieties in dogs may be triggered by fireworks, thunderstorms, gunshots, and even loud or sharp bird noises. Associated stimuli may also come to trigger the symptoms of the phobia or anxiety, such as a change in barometric pressure being associated with a thunderstorm, thus causing an anticipatory anxiety. Tail chasing Tail chasing can be classified as a stereotypy. It falls under obsessive compulsive disorder, which is a neuropsychiatric disorder that can present in dogs as canine compulsive disorder. In one clinical study on this potential behavioral problem, 18 tail- chasing terriers were given clomipramine orally at a dosage of 1 to 2 mg/kg (0.5 to 0.9 mg/lb) of body weight, every 12 hours. Three of the dogs required treatment at a slightly higher dosage range to control tail chasing, however, after 1 to 12 weeks of treatment, 9 of 12 dogs were reported to have a 75% or greater reduction in tail chasing. Personality can also play a factor in tail chasing. Dogs who chase their tails have been found to be more shy than those who do not, and some dogs also show a lower level of response during tail chasing bouts. Behavior compared to other canids Comparisons made within the wolf-like canids allow the identification of those behaviors that may have been inherited from common ancestry and those that may have been the result of domestication or other relatively recent environmental changes. Studies of free-ranging African Basenjis and New Guinea Singing Dogs indicate that their behavioral and ecological traits were the result of environmental selection pressures or selective breeding choices and not the result of artificial selection imposed by humans. Early aggression Dog pups show unrestrained fighting with their siblings from 2 weeks of age, with injury avoided only due to their undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing with the development of running skills at 4‚Äì5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more- developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play- fighting with their siblings. Serious fighting occurs during 4‚Äì6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4‚Äì6 weeks when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10‚Äì12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Tameness Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.Serpell J, Duffy D. Dog Breeds and Their Behavior. In: Domestic Dog Cognition and Behavior. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer; 2014 In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight responseAlmada RC, Coimbra NC. Recruitment of striatonigral disinhibitory and nigrotectal inhibitory GABAergic pathways during the organization of defensive behavior by mice in a dangerous environment with the venomous snake Bothrops alternatus [ Reptilia , Viperidae ] Synapse 2015:n/a‚Äìn/a (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves.Coppinger R, Schneider R: Evolution of working dogs. The domestic dog: Its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people. Cambridge: Cambridge University press, 1995. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation. Social structure Among canids, packs are the social units that hunt, rear young and protect a communal territory as a stable group and their members are usually related. Members of the feral dog group are usually not related. Feral dog groups are composed of a stable 2‚Äì6 members compared to the 2‚Äì15 member wolf pack whose size fluctuates with the availability of prey and reaches a maximum in winter time. The feral dog group consists of monogamous breeding pairs compared to the one breeding pair of the wolf pack. Agonistic behavior does not extend to the individual level and does not support a higher social structure compared to the ritualized agonistic behavior of the wolf pack that upholds its social structure. Feral pups have a very high mortality rate that adds little to the group size, with studies showing that adults are usually killed through accidents with humans, therefore other dogs need to be co-opted from villages to maintain stable group size. Socialization The critical period for socialization begins with walking and exploring the environment. Dog and wolf pups both develop the ability to see, hear and smell at 4 weeks of age. Dogs begin to explore the world around them at 4 weeks of age with these senses available to them, while wolves begin to explore at 2 weeks of age when they have the sense of smell but are functionally blind and deaf. The consequences of this is that more things are novel and frightening to wolf pups. The critical period for socialization closes with the avoidance of novelty, when the animal runs away from - rather than approaching and exploring - novel objects. For dogs this develops between 4 and 8 weeks of age. Wolves reach the end of the critical period after 6 weeks, after which it is not possible to socialize a wolf. Dog puppies require as little as 90 minutes of contact with humans during their critical period of socialization to form a social attachment. This will not create a highly social pet but a dog that will solicit human attention. Wolves require 24 hours contact a day starting before 3 weeks of age. To create a socialized wolf the pups are removed from the den at 10 days of age, kept in constant human contact until they are 4 weeks old when they begin to bite their sleeping human companions, then spend only their waking hours in the presence of humans. This socialization process continues until age 4 months, when the pups can join other captive wolves but will require daily human contact to remain socialized. Despite this intensive socialization process, a well-socialized wolf will behave differently to a well-socialized dog and will display species-typical hunting and reproductive behaviors, only closer to humans than a wild wolf. These wolves do not generalize their socialization to all humans in the same manner as a socialized dog and they remain more fearful of novelty compared to socialized dogs. In 1982, a study to observe the differences between dogs and wolves raised in similar conditions took place. The dog puppies preferred larger amounts of sleep at the beginning of their lives, while the wolf puppies were much more active. The dog puppies also preferred the company of humans, rather than their canine foster mother, though the wolf puppies were the exact opposite, spending more time with their foster mother. The dogs also showed a greater interest in the food given to them and paid little attention to their surroundings, while the wolf puppies found their surroundings to be much more intriguing than their food or food bowl. The wolf puppies were observed taking part in antagonistic play at a younger age, while the dog puppies did not display dominant/submissive roles until they were much older. The wolf puppies were rarely seen as being aggressive to each other or towards the other canines. On the other hand, the dog puppies were much more aggressive to each other and other canines, often seen full-on attacking their foster mother or one another. Cognition Despite claims that dogs show more human-like social cognition than wolves, several recent studies have demonstrated that if wolves are properly socialized to humans and have the opportunity to interact with humans regularly, then they too can succeed on some human-guided cognitive tasks, in some cases out-performing dogs at an individual level. Similar to dogs, wolves can also follow more complex point types made with body parts other than the human arm and hand (e.g. elbow, knee, foot). Both dogs and wolves have the cognitive capacity for prosocial behavior toward humans; however it is not guaranteed. For canids to perform well on traditional human-guided tasks (e.g. following the human point) both relevant lifetime experiences with humans - including socialization to humans during the critical period for social development - and opportunities to associate human body parts with certain outcomes (such as food being provided by human hands, a human throwing or kicking a ball, etc.) are required. After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not. Reproduction Dogs reach sexual maturity and can reproduce during their first year in contrast to a wolf at two years. The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the last one. The canid genus is influenced by the photoperiod and generally reproduces in the springtime. Domestic dogs are not reliant on seasonality for reproduction in contrast to the wolf, coyote, Australian dingo and African basenji that may have only one, seasonal, estrus each year. Feral dogs are influenced by the photoperiod with around half of the breeding females mating in the springtime, which is thought to indicate an ancestral reproductive trait not overcome by domestication, as can be inferred from wolves and Cape hunting dogs. Domestic dogs are polygamous in contrast to wolves that are generally monogamous. Therefore, domestic dogs have no pair bonding and the protection of a single mate, but rather have multiple mates in a year. There is no paternal care in dogs as opposed to wolves where all pack members assist the mother with the pups. The consequence is that wolves put a lot of energy into producing a few pups in contrast to dogs that maximize the production of pups. This higher pup production rate enables dogs to maintain or even increase their population with a lower pup survival rate than wolves, and allows dogs a greater capacity than wolves to grow their population after a population crash or when entering a new habitat. It is proposed that these differences are an alternative breeding strategy adapted to a life of scavenging instead of hunting. In contrast to domestic dogs, feral dogs are monogamous. Domestic dogs tend to have a litter size of 10, wolves 3, and feral dogs 5‚Äì8. Feral pups have a very high mortality rate with only 5% surviving at the age of one year, and sometimes the pups are left unattended making them vulnerable to predators. Domestic dogs stand alone among all canids for a total lack of paternal care. Dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species as they generally do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same territory. However, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young, as well as care for the young by the males, has been observed in domestic dogs, dingos and in feral or semi-feral dogs. In one study of a group of free-ranging dogs, for the first 2 weeks immediately after parturition the lactating females were observed to be more aggressive to protect the pups. The male parents were in contact with the litters as ‚Äòguard‚Äô dogs for the first 6‚Äì8 weeks of the litters‚Äô life. In absence of the mothers, they were observed to prevent the approach of strangers by vocalizations or even by physical attacks. Moreover, one male fed the litter by regurgitation showing the existence of paternal care in some free-roaming dogs. Space Space used by feral dogs is not dissimilar from most other canids in that they use defined traditional areas (home ranges) that tend to be defended against intruders, and have core areas where most of their activities are undertaken. Urban domestic dogs have a home range of 2-61 hectares in contrast to a feral dogs home range of 58 square kilometers. Wolf home ranges vary from 78 square kilometers where prey is deer to 2.5 square kilometers at higher latitudes where prey is moose and caribou. Wolves will defend their territory based on prey abundance and pack density, but feral dogs will defend their home ranges all year. Where wolf ranges and feral dog ranges overlap, the feral dogs will site their core areas closer to human settlement. Predation and scavenging Despite claims in the popular press, studies could not find evidence of a single predation on cattle by feral dogs. However, domestic dogs were responsible for the death of 3 calves over one 5-year study. Other studies in Europe and North America indicate only limited success in the consumption of wild boar, deer and other ungulates, however it could not be determined if this was predation or scavenging on carcasses. Studies have observed feral dogs conducting brief, uncoordinated chases of small game with constant barking - a technique without success. In 2004, a study reviewed 5 other studies of feral dogs published between 1975 and 1995 and concluded that their pack structure is very loose and rarely involves any cooperative behavior, either in raising young or in obtaining food. Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor ungulate hunters, having little effect on wildlife populations where they are sympatric. However, several garbage dumps located within the feral dog's home range are important for their survival. Even well-fed domestic dogs are prone to scavenge; gastro-intestinal veterinary visits increase during warmer weather as dogs are prone to eat decaying material. Some dogs consume feces, which may contain nutrition. On occasion well-fed dogs have been known to scavenge their owners' corpses. Dogs in human society Studies using an operant framework have indicated that humans can influence the behavior of dogs through food, petting and voice. Food and 20‚Äì30 seconds of petting maintained operant responding in dogs. Some dogs will show a preference for petting once food is readily available, and dogs will remain in proximity to a person providing petting and show no satiation to that stimulus. Petting alone was sufficient to maintain the operant response of military dogs to voice commands, and responses to basic obedience commands in all dogs increased when only vocal praise was provided for correct responses. A study using dogs that were trained to remain motionless while unsedated and unrestrained in an MRI scanner exhibited caudate activation to a hand signal associated with reward. Further work found that the magnitude of the canine caudate response is similar to that of humans, while the between-subject variability in dogs may be less than humans. In a further study, 5 scents were presented (self, familiar human, strange human, familiar dog, strange dog). While the olfactory bulb/peduncle was activated to a similar degree by all the scents, the caudate was activated maximally to the familiar human. Importantly, the scent of the familiar human was not the handler, meaning that the caudate response differentiated the scent in the absence of the person being present. The caudate activation suggested that not only did the dogs discriminate that scent from the others, they had a positive association with it. Although these signals came from two different people, the humans lived in the same household as the dog and therefore represented the dog's primary social circle. And while dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of items that are not comparable, it seems that the ‚Äúreward response‚Äù is reserved for their humans. Research has shown that there are individual differences in the interactions between dogs and their human that have significant effects on dog behavior. In 1997, a study showed that the type of relationship between dog and master, characterized as either companionship or working relationship, significantly affected the dog's performance on a cognitive problem-solving task. They speculate that companion dogs have a more dependent relationship with their owners, and look to them to solve problems. In contrast, working dogs are more independent. Dogs in the family In 2013, a study produced the first evidence under controlled experimental observation for a correlation between the owner's personality and their dog's behaviour. Dogs at work Service dogs are those that are trained to help people with disabilities such as blindness, epilepsy, diabetes and autism. Detection dogs are trained to using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, or blood. In science, dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex. Attack dogs, dogs that have been trained to attack on command, are employed in security, police, and military roles. Service dog programs have been established to help individuals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and have shown to have positive results. Attacks A dog's teeth can inflict serious injuries The human-dog relationship is based on unconditional trust; however, if this trust is lost it will be difficult to reinstate. In the UK between 2005 and 2013, there were 17 fatal dog attacks. In 2007‚Äì08, there were 4,611 hospital admissions due to dog attacks, which increased to 5,221 in 2008‚Äì09. It was estimated in 2013 that more than 200,000 people a year are bitten by dogs in England, with the annual cost to the National Health Service of treating injuries about ¬£3 million. A report published in 2014 stated there were 6,743 hospital admissions specifically caused by dog bites, a 5.8% increase from the 6,372 admissions in the previous 12 months. In the US between 1979 and 1996, there were more than 300 human dog bite-related fatalities. In the US in 2013, there were 31 dog-bite related deaths. Each year, more than 4.5 million people in the US are bitten by dogs and almost 1 in 5 require medical attention. A dog's thick fur protects it from the bite of another dog, but humans are furless and are not so protected. Attack training is condemned by some as promoting ferocity in dogs; a 1975 American study showed that 10% of dogs that have bitten a person received attack dog training at some point.

The port of Sunda Kelapa. Penjaringan Subdistrict is the area to the left of the port. The right side of the port is the Administrative Village of Ancol in Pademangan Subdistrict. The historic Pasar Ikan (\\"fish market\\") is the building on the foreground, built on a restored warehouse of Dutch East India Company (VOC). Penjaringan is a subdistrict of North Jakarta, Indonesia. It is the westernmost Subdistrict of North Jakarta. Muara Angke port and the mouth of Sunda Kelapa Port is located within Penjaringan. Penjaringan contains the remnants of the original mangrove forest of Jakarta, some is protected by the government (i.e. Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary). Penjaringan Subdistrict is crisscrossed with water draining channels, canals, and water reservoirs to protect the land from sea flooding. The Cengkareng Drain, part of Jakarta's flood control system, flows to the sea through this subdistrict. The area of Penjaringan Subdistrict, especially within Penjaringan Administrative Village, contains several historic Dutch colonial buildings such as the remains of city wall of Batavia and the 17th-century warehouses (now a Maritime Museum). The boundaries of Penjaringan Subdistrict are Jakarta Bay to the north, Sunda Kelapa port to the east, and Kamal Muara road - Kapuk Raya road to the south. History The coastal area of Penjaringan Subdistrict is one of the most historic areas in Jakarta. The mouth of Ciliwung River was an important port in West Java. It was used as the main port of the kingdom of Pakuan Pajajaran and Batavia. Around the 16th century, the Muara Angke (a coastal area to the west of old Batavia) was used by the Sultanate of Banten and the Sultanate of Demak as a strategic post to capture the port of Sunda Kelapa from the Portuguese. The Pasar Ikan (\\"Fish Market\\") in the 1940s In the 17th century, during the Dutch colonial era, the area that is now Penjaringan Administrative Village was developed into a ship docking area. Warehouses and ship building facilities are built on this area, some of these 17th-century structures still exist today (such as the now Museum Bahari and Galangan Kapal VOC, a former trade office built in 1628). In the 18th century, local villages started to appear around the Dutch Batavia. Some of this villages, located within the port of Batavia, is today known as Kampung Luar Batang. Kampung Luar Batang is the location of the Luar Batang Mosque, established in 1739. During the 1970s, because of insufficient capacity and the lack of facility, a new fishing port called Pelabuhan Perikanan Samudera Jakarta (PPSJ) (also known as \\"Jakarta Fishing Port\\") was created on the west side of Sunda Kelapa Harbor, within Penjaringan Subdistrict. The feasibility and engineering study was done by Japan International Cooperation Agency from 1973 to 1979. The construction was divided into four phases which began in 1980 and was finished in 2002. Mangrove forest Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary contains the original mangrove forest of Jakarta. Penjaringan contains some of Jakarta's original mangrove forest. Some of this mangrove forests are protected as the Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary (located at Kapuk Muara Administrative Village). Other protected mangrove forest of Penjaringan Subdistrict is the privately owned byJakarta's government has given the area to PT Murindra Karya Lestari in attempt to rehabilitate the area back into its original natural state.

He was the son of ƒÄyu, the eldest son of Pururavas, and Prabha, the daughter of SvarbhƒÅnu. Nahusha reigned from Pratishthana. He married Viraja, the daughter of the Pitrs. They had six or seven sons, according to different Puranas. His eldest son Yati became a muni (ascetic). He was succeeded by his second son Yayati.Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.85-6. In another and more popular variation of his story, he is said to have married Ashokasundari, a goddess who the daughter of Shiva and Parvati and is said to have given birth to YayatiBibek Debroy, Dipavali Debroy (2002). The holy Puranas. p. 152. \\"Nahusha and Ashokasundari had a son named Yayati.‚Äù and a hundred daughters of Nahusha. Sister Nivedita also has mentioned about the king Nahusa in one story \\"The Worth of Kine\\" in relation to the great sage Bharadwaja who was accidentally caught in a net along with fish by fishermen who were fishing in a river. The fishermen took the rishi Chyavana to king Nahusha and asked him to pay the price for the fish and the rishi, with the king offering a cow in return for the sage.  Legend  Birth and early life Once Parvati and Shiva went to the Nandana grove. Parvati saw the Kalpavriksha (wish-giving tree) and wished that a daughter would be born. Instantly, a woman named Ashokasundari was born. Parvati said that Ashoksundari is destined to marry the son of Ayu. Once, when the Asura Hunda entered the grove, he was lustful and kidnapped Ashoksundari, who told him that she would only marry the son of Ayu. Ashoksundari cursed Hunda that the son of Ayu will kill him. Ashoksundari then started severe penance. Meanwhile, Pururavas was the ancestor of all Chandravanshi dynasties and he ruled over the kingdom of Prayaga, with Pratishthana as his capital. After he retired from being a king and gave up his kingdom to his son and ascended to heaven, his eldest son ƒÄyu became the king. ƒÄyu was married to Prabha, the daughter of the Asura Rahu. However, he remained childless. ƒÄyu approached the seer Dattatreya and after propitiating him, he requested the sage to grant him a son who would be invincible and possess many virtuous qualities fit for a king. The sage obliged and a son was born to ƒÄyu. Hunda was just waiting for the birth of Ayu's son because he was scared that Ashoksundari's curse would come true. So, the infant was kidnapped by the Asura Hunda and he ordered his minions to slay the child. However the minions only abandoned the child at the hermitage of Sage Vashistha. Vashistha took the child and named him Nahusha \\"the fearless one\\". Nahusha grew into a youth, a disciple of Vashistha. Eventually Vashistha revealed Nahusha's true parentage. Nahusha acquired weapons from the gods and killed Hunda in battle and returned to his parents. He then married Ashoksundari. Ruling Svarga Nahusha was made the king of Svarga after Indra's disappearance. He soon became arrogant and was later removed from his post. In the Dwapara Yuga, when the Pandavas were on their final journey in the Himalayas, Nahusha in his serpent form captures Bhima and decides to eat him. Despite Bhima's extraordinary strength, Nahusha is too powerful, as he had received boon while falling, from Agastya, that taken by him, strong beings superior to him, shall immediately lose their strength. Meanwhile, Yudhistira was looking for Bhima. He found him and saw what was happening him. Nahusha reveals himself to be Yudhishthira's ancestor and tells him of his curse. Yudhishthira and Nahusha discourse each other on their views of Dharma. Nahusha tells Yudhishthira of his mistakes and asks him to learn from them. Nahusha is relieved from his curse and goes to heaven. Bhima then receives his strength.

Several of the shabads (hymns) from the Guru Granth Sahib address the role of women in Indian and Sikh society. Shabads from the Guru Granth Sahib From woman, man is born In this Shabad, the Guru expresses the importance of women. It begins with the line \\"From a woman, a man is born\\" to emphasise that all men and women come from a woman. This theme then continues with the Guru highlighting, in a logical sequence, the various stages of life where the importance of woman is noted ‚Äì \\"within woman, man is conceived,\\" and then, \\" he is engaged and married\\" to a woman who becomes his friend, partner, and the source for future generations. This Shabad shows that, throughout man's life, he is dependent on woman at every critical stage. The Shabad continues, \\"When his woman dies, he seeks another woman\\" ‚Äì so if his wife dies, a man feels the compulsion to find another women still. In the final lines, the Guru asks: \\"So why call her bad?\\" ‚Äì when even kings are born from a female mother as are other women themselves. The Guru then conclude that \\"without woman ‚Äì there would be no one at all\\". This leaves no doubt for the Guru that the female gender plays a critical part in every aspect of a man's life, someone who is there in one shape or form throughout life and also is critical for the survival of the human race and the very existence of humans to begin with. In this Shabad, the Guru outlines the importance, magnitude, and value of women, in very simple terms, and shows what a significant role they play in propagation of the species as well as multiple other roles. This Shabad is mainly aimed at the culture of that time which consistently put women as below men, as such this type of thinking was to encourage the men of those times to view women more equally. However, this hymn remains pertinent today due to the subjugation of women in many cultures. Bhai Gurdas Vaaran is also recommended to Sikhs by Gurus. Some part of these Vaaran state as follows: \\"At birth a Sikh girl is immediately ‚Äúour darling‚Äù to her mother and father. Later, she becomes admired by her brothers and sisters and favored by her relatives. On attaining ‚Äúthe bloom of youth,‚Äù she is married, with costly gifts and presents. Now, respected by her husbands family, and deemed lucky in her new household, she is regarded as the equal of her spouse in both virtue and wisdom. She becomes as a doorway to salvation. Such is the verbal portrait of a Guru-inspired, and blessed, faithful Sikh woman.\\" (5.16) Shabad against Sati Sati is an Indian custom of immolation of a woman on her dead husband's funeral pyre either willingly or by societal inducement and compulsion. Guru Nanak said the following about this practice: The Guru said that if the wife really loves her husband, then she should endure the pain of separation alive; that she should rather continue living her life than suffer a quick death in the fire of her husband's funeral pyre. Further, Guru Nanak explains that a true \\"Sati\\" is the person who cannot endure the pain of separation from their loved one. Shabad against dowry The Sikh Gurus spoke against the common practice of dowry when a gift of money or valuables had to be given by the bride's family to that of the groom at the time of their marriage. Huge pressure was exerted on the bride's family for the extraction of a sizable fortune at times of marriage. It has historically been regarded as a contribution by her family to the married household's future expenses. The Gurus called this giving of gifts an \\"offer for show\\" of the guests, and a \\"worthless display\\" which only increased \\"false egotism.\\" Sikh families were discouraged from continuing this practice, and slowly this trend has diminished in some parts of Indian society.

The piece was first produced at the Savoy Theatre from 17 June to 31 July 1897 and from 16 August to 20 November 1897 as a companion piece to The Yeomen of the Guard, from 10 December 1897 to 12 March 1898 with The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein, and from 22 March to 21 May 1898 with The Gondoliers, for a total of 252 performances. A copy of the vocal score (published in 1898 by J. Williams), but no printed libretto, is found in British Library. The score contains all the dialogue. Background When the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership disbanded after the production of The Gondoliers in 1889, the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte filled the Savoy Theatre with a combination of new works and revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\" , Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 To create Old Sarah, Carte selected two artists who he knew could deliver a good piece. Cellier was the long-time music director of the Savoy Theatre and had produced other works for Carte. Greenbank was also a known quantity, first for having supplied the theatre with two other curtain raisers, Captain Billy (1891) and Mr. Jericho (1893). In addition, by this time, Greenbank's reputation was well established, having supplied lyrics for a number of hit musicals, including A Gaiety Girl (1893), An Artist's Model (1895), The Geisha (1896), and The Circus Girl (1896). Synopsis In Dullport, a dreary seaside town, out of season, Old Sarah sells sweets from a stall. She has only sold 2 ounces of acid drops and a pennyworth of mint rock in 7 weeks. Simon smuggles rum as the only way to make an \\"honest\\" living. Because nobody has any money, they all hate Archibald Jones, the income tax collector, except his sweetheart Margery (Simon's daughter). Claude Newcastle, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, arrives. By snooping around, he discovers a lot of things about people's incomes. However, when he snoops on Sarah she locks him in a bathing machine and threatens to drown him in the sea. He is, however, rescued by Archibald, forgives everybody, and all ends happily. Roles and original cast The original cast was: *The Rt. Hon.

FEBS Lett 343:65. is the smallest known protein with prolyl isomerase activity, which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds. Although parvulin has no homology with larger prolyl isomerases such as cyclophilin and FKBP, it does share structural features with subdomains of other proteins involved in preparing secreted proteins for export from the cell.Balbach J, Schmid FX. (2000). Proline isomerizarion and its catalysis in protein folding. In Mechanisms of Protein Folding 2nd ed. Ed. RH Pain. Frontiers in Molecular Biology series. Oxford University Press: Oxford, UK. Although parvulin is as active as the larger prolyl isomerases against a short proline-containing test peptide, it has lower relative activity against biological substrates, possibly because the larger molecules have a higher ability to bind the substrate peptide.Scholz C, Rahfeld J, Fischer G, Schmid FX. (1997). Catalysis of protein folding by parvulin. J Mol Biol 273(3):752-62. Parvulin itself contains proline residues and its folding can be accelerated by the presence of cyclophilin; parvulin folding can also be autocatalytic. A eukaryotic homolog of parvulin known as Pin1 is required to execute the transition from G2 phase to M phase in the cell cycle.Gothel SF, Marahiel MA. (1999). Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, a superfamily of ubiquitous folding catalysts. Cell Mol Life Sci 55(3):423-36. Absence of Pin1 activity in humans has also been implicated in the folding and processing of the amyloid precursor protein, whose degradation product is the cytotoxic peptide amyloid beta implicated in Alzheimer's disease.Pastorino L, Sun A, Lu PJ, Zhou XZ, Balastik M, Finn G, Wulf G, Lim J, Li SH, Li X, Xia W, Nicholson LK, Lu KP.

Biography Born on January 1, 1907 to Russian Jewish immigrant parents in England, Brody was raised in London, Paris, Richmond (VA) and New York City. In 1927 he married artist Claire Gebiner with whom he would have two children before the marriage ended in 1941. A son Julian was born in 1930 and a daughter Mady in 1937. Brody took an early interest in political activism and documentary films. In May, 1930 he wrote in The Daily Worker what would become a rallying cry for left wing filmmakers: In 1931 Brody and several others formed the Workers Film and Photo League, variously acting as cameramen, teachers and political theoreticians. In addition to his league activities, he was a regular contributor of film criticism and commentary to various left wing publications, including the Daily Worker and Experimental Cinema. In 1940 Brody met artist Alice Neel, beginning a complicated, sometimes controversial, on and off affair that would end in 1955. They had one son, Hartley Neel, in 1941. Brody remained friends with Neel until her death in 1984. In 1955, Brody met and soon married photographer Sondra Herrera. They had one son, David, in 1958.

He appeared, beginning in the late 1860s, in many Bancroft productions and was engaged by other managers, including J. L.

He left the army in 1868, and, having enjoyed amateur theatricals while serving in India, he was attracted by a stage career. A mutual friend put him in touch with Marie Bancroft, who cast him as Charles Hampton, a light romantic role, in a comedy, Tame Cats at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. He made an immediate impression. The magazine Fun published an article with the title \\"Tame Cats; Or, The Triumph of Collette\\";Fun, 26 December 1868, p. 161 this, however, was not so much a tribute to the actor as a rebuke to his over-enthusiastic friends in the audience.The same charge was made in the magazine The Orchestra, 19 December 1868, p. 196 Over the succeeding years, Collette appeared in many Bancroft productions, including School by T.

This play was on the bill at the Royalty Theatre, with Collette in the lead, when Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury was premiered in 1875.Stone, David.

The popularity of the song prompted unauthorized distribution of the words and music.

It was popular in the 1920s and 1930s, notably appearing in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 classic, The Sun Also Rises, in which Jake Barnes, the narrator, drinks a Jack Rose in the Crillon Paris hotel bar while awaiting the arrival of Lady Brett Ashley. It was also a favorite drink of author John Steinbeck. The Jack Rose is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks. History References to the Jack Rose date back to the early 20th century. A 1905 article in the National Police Gazette mentions the drink and credits a New Jersey bartender named Frank J. May as its creator. A 1913 news article mentions that sales of the drink had suffered due to the involvement of Bald Jack Rose in the Rosenthal murder case. There are various theories as to the origin of the drink's name. One has the drink being named after (or even invented by) the infamous gambler Bald Jack Rose. However, this is disproven by the fact that the drink predates Bald Jack Rose's career. Albert Stevens Crockett states that it is named after the pink \\"Jacquemot\\" (also known as Jacqueminot or Jacque) rose. It has been suggested that the Jack Rose was invented by Joseph P. Rose, a Newark, New Jersey restaurateur who once held the title of \\"World's Champion Mixologist.\\" Harvey's Famous Restaurant in Washington, D.C. also claimed to be the originator of the cocktail. The most likely explanation of the name is that it is a simple portmanteau ‚Äî it is made with applejack and is rose colored from the grenadine. The cocktail has fallen out of fashion. In June 2003, the Washington Post published an article that chronicled two writers' quest to find a Jack Rose in a Washington, D.C. bar. After visiting numerous bars, they were unsuccessful in finding one where the bartender knew the drink and the bar stocked applejack. Ultimately they bought a bottle of applejack for one of the few bartenders they encountered who knew how to make one. With the craft cocktail movement on the rise, the Jack Rose has regained some popularity. Laird & Company, producers of the most widely available brands of applejack in the United States, have said sales are up in part due to renewed interest in the cocktail.

Chat in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina M. Chat (also known as Monsieur Chat and Mr Chat) is the name of a graffiti cat that originally appeared in Orl√©ans, France in 1997. The graffiti appeared most frequently on chimneys, but was also sighted in other places, such as train platforms and at political rallies. The artist was originally anonymous, but in 2007 Thoma Vuille was caught in the act of creating the cat. The yellow cartoon cat is characterized by its large Cheshire Cat grin. The cat is most often portrayed in a running pose, but has also been variously depicted waving signal flags, bouncing on a ball, sporting angel wings, and waving in greeting at the entrance to a train station. It is sometimes accompanied by the tag \\"M. Chat\\" in small letters. A 2004 documentary, Chats perch√©s (The Case of the Grinning Cat), by film maker Chris Marker, used the phenomenon of M. Chat's appearance across France as a springboard for a reflection on the state of the country post-9/11. During a 2010 exhibition in Paris, Vuille claimed to have 60 cats across the French capital.http://www.english.rfi.fr/culture/20100316-chatting-monsieur-chat- paris-graffiti-show There are currently two in New York City, of which one is on the High Line at 28th Street.

There are currently three in Pristina, Kosovo on the central pedestrianised area. One on the side of the National Theatre. There are some in Vietnam, too.

He appears in the pedigrees of many dressage, show jumping, and eventing horses today. Breeding The sire of Bay Ronald, Hampton, also sired four classic winners: Ayrshire, Merry Hampton, Reve d'Or, and Ladas (who won The Derby). His dam Black Duchess only won one small race, but she did produce Black Cherry who was the dam of Cherry Lass (1,000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks), Blanche (the dam of Blandford) and Jean's Folly (dam of Night Hawk, winner of the St Leger).Leicester, Sir Charles, Bloodstock Breeding, J.A. Allen & Co, London, 1969 Bay Ronald's dam-sire, Galliard, won the 2,000 Guineas. Racing career As a two-year-old, Bay Ronald started five times, finishing third in one race. As a three-year-old, he started eight times, winning two races: the Limekiln Stakes (one mile) and the Lowther Stakes (1¬Ω miles) held at Newmarket Racecourse. He finished fifth behind Persimmon in The Derby after disputing the lead until the last two furlongs. At four, he had one win out of six starts, at the 1¬Ω mile Hardwicke Stakes. He also placed second at the Champion Stakes, and third in the Eclipse Stakes. As a five-year-old he improved slightly, winning two out of seven starts: the City and Suburban Handicap (1¬º miles) and the Epsom Gold Cup, carrying 132 pounds. Urged by thus success, his owner decided to enter him in the 2¬Ω mile Ascot Gold Cup. However, the distance was too great, and he did not finish well. Despite this, Bay Ronald came out the next day to place second in the Hardwicke Stakes. The 1889 season was to be his last on the track. Bay Ronald had a moderate racing career. In his 26 starts he won five times and placed three times. He was retired to stud having won ¬£6,443.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 Stud record Bay Ronald first stood at Preston Farm in 1899. Due to his rather unimpressive record, his stud fee for the first season was 25 guineas, and free to mares who had already produced winners. During his time at stud in England, he bred few mares‚Äîless than 20 each year‚Äîand they were generally of poor quality. Later, his stud fee would reach 100 guineas. Five of his first crop of foals went on to win as two-year-olds. His second crop included the Rous Memorial Stakes winner, Wild Oats, and six other winners. One of these winners was MacDonald II, a colt out of a French mare, who went on to be quite successful. Bay Ronald's third crop, who began racing in 1905, were less impressive. However, it was at this time that his son, MacDonald II, began to show his talent. He left behind his fourth crop, including then-yearling Dark Ronald, and fifth crop, which produced his son, Bayardo, when he left for Cheri Halbronn's stud. Bay Ronald was placed second and third on the sires list before being sold for ¬£5,000 to France. In France, Bay Ronald produced some good horses, including Combourg, Greffulhe, Fidia and also Rondeau, the dam of the influential Teddy. Bay Ronald tended to pass on his stoutness. He was the most influential of the Hampton sons, and his offspring continued the Hampton sire line. Progeny *Bayardo: 22 wins out of 25 starts, including the St. Leger Stakes, Champion Stakes, Limekiln Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup. Sired the filly Bayuda (winner of The Oaks), and sires two English triple crown winners: Gay Crusader and Gainsborough. *Combourg: won the Prix Royal-Oak and the Prix du Cadran *Dark Ronald: a very influential son of Bay Ronald, sire of Son-In-Law, who is found in the pedigrees of many top sport horses in the world today. *Fidia: won the Gran Premio di Milano (Italy) *Greffulhe: won the Prix Noailles *Macdonald II: winner of the Prix de Sablonville, the Prix du Conseil Municipal, the Prix Royal-Oak, the F√ºrstenberg-Rennen (Germany), and two-time winner of the Prix Boiard. Finished second in the Prix du Jockey Club. Sired As d'Atout (winner of the Grand Prix de Paris). *Rondeau: dam of the stallion Teddy, who was very influential in Germany, France, Britain, the US, and Italy. *Many other fillies by Dark Ronald went on to notable success. Sport horse breeding Bay Ronald had the greatest influence on the sport horse breeding industry through his son Dark Ronald and grandson Teddy. Overall, the number of top sport horses who feature him in their lineage is spectacular. He is especially prominent in sport horses of thoroughbred breeding, such as many of the top eventers. Teddy is seen in the pedigrees of Matcho AA, and eventers Dr. Peaches, and The Gray Goose. Dark Ronald is seen in the pedigrees of World Cup I, and his brothers, the Hanoverian Werther (in which Dark Ronald appears twice), the great Pik As, Valentino xx, Waidmannsdank xx, Lord, Son-in-Law (great grand-sire to Cottage Son), and Ladykiller xx (who has had a fantastic influence on the Holstein breed). Cor de la Bryere and Landgraf I were also linebred to him. Dark Ronald is also featured in the pedigrees of Furioso, Beau Pere (progeny include international jumpers White Lightning and Encore (winner of the Grand Prix at Fontainebleau and a USET team member), eventer Landlady, two-time American invitational winner Sundancer, Canadian equestrian team member Easy Doc, and British equestrian team member Turn on the Sun), Der Loewe (in the pedigree of such horses as Salinero, Arko, and Brentina), and dressage stallion Bolero (sire of Brentano II, grand-sire of Poetin and Brentina). Top eventers with Dark Ronald include Shear Leau and Bally Cor (both through Son-in-Law). Through his son Bayardo, Bay Ronald also had an influence on sport horse breeding. Bayardo produced English Triple Crown winner Gainsborough, who sired the small colt Hyperion. Hyperion is found in the pedigrees of many sport horses, including the show jumpers Carling King, Jet Run, Pan American silver medalist A Little Bit, Encore (who also went back to Bay Ronald through Dark Ronald), Canadian equestrian team horse Stoic, Anne Kursinski's jumper Eros, and USET jumper Aberali. Hyperion's dressage offspring include Pion, and the influential sire Lauries Crusador (who produced 2000 World Young Dressage Horse Champion Laurentianer, and Londonderry, winner of the jumping class for 4-year-olds at the 1999 at the Bundeschampionate). He is also in the pedigree of eventers Charisma, Winsome Adante, Eagle Lion, Biko, and Sandrift, and the great sire of eventers Ben Faerie (sire of Priceless and Walk on Star, dam-sire of Primmore's Pride). Both Bayardo and Teddy are seen in the pedigrees of many horses, many times through the stallion Djebel. These horses include Bolero (sire of Brentano II, Brentina, and many others) and My Babu (grandsire of eventer JJ Babu and many others). Bayardo and Teddy are also seen in the pedigree of Might Tango. Both Dark Ronald and Teddy are seen in the pedigree of Donnerwetter (the sire of the enormously influential Donnerhall) as well as the influential stallion Rantzau. All three are seen in the pedigree of the great eventer Prince Panache (through Son-in-Law and My Babu), and the pedigree of Tamarillo has Bay Ronald featured almost 30 times, mostly through Bayardo and Teddy, but also through Dark Ronald and Macdonald.

This is the directorial debut of Rydstrom, a seven-time Academy Award-winning sound editor and mixer, and the first produced by Katherine Sarafian, who went on to produce Pixar's Brave released in 2012. The short premiered on October 12, 2006 at the 42nd Chicago International Film Festival at Columbia College, and was released theatrically and on home media with Pixar's Ratatouille on June 29, 2007.  Plot  A young alien, Stu, is inside a spacecraft taking an alien abduction test. He must snatch a sleeping farmer named Ernie under the watchful eye of his impassive examiner, a gelatinous blob named Mr. B. Working from memory, Stu is expected to use an array of thousands of identical unlabeled toggle switches for this purpose; Mr. B's neutral expression gives no hints of which ones to use. Stu's hesitant flicks of the switches turn out to be wrong, causing Ernie to bump into the walls and ceiling, albeit without waking him up. As Stu grows increasingly frustrated, Stu yells and swipes randomly at the array. Ernie bounces randomly around the room like a pinball, knocking over the furniture in the process but remaining asleep. Eventually, after checking his notes, Stu does succeed in maneuvering Ernie out the window and up into the ship, but he shuts off the tractor beam without closing the cargo hatch. As Ernie plummets toward the ground, Mr. B takes over and catches him, he then pushes Stu far away from him and starts working the switches with incredible speed to put him back in his bed and clean up the mess Stu created. Dejected over his failure, Stu struggles to hold back tears. With a sigh, the sympathetic Mr. B allows him to launch the spaceship for the trip home. Stu cheerfully grabs the steering yoke and begins to maneuver; a moment later the ship slams to the ground, crushing Ernie's house. When it lifts off, its underside is covered with dirt and debris, and nothing is left of the house except a tall pillar of dirt in the center of a crater, cut out by the open cargo hatch. Atop this, Ernie is still sound asleep in bed. As the end credits run, the sound of Ernie's alarm clock is heard, followed by his yawn, a scream and a thud ‚Äì indicating that he has fallen into the crater.  Production  Production on the film began in mid-2005 and was completed in the summer of 2006.Taylor Jessen. \\"2007's Oscar-Nominated Animated Shorts: Three Fords, a Vespa and a Kit Bike\\", Animation World Magazine, 2-27-2007 There were no large technological advances used in Lifted, only the use of a new program called Jiggle. This program gives the animators a way to resonate, or jiggle, certain parts of a body. The animator can control how far out to resonate, such as only within a limb, or to stay away from specific parts of the body such as the face.  Awards  Lifted was nominated for Best Animated Short Film on January 23, 2007 for the 79th Academy Awards. It was also included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2006.

Bayardo was inbred to Galopin in the second and fourth generations (2√ó4) and to Sterling in the fourth generation (4√ó4). Racing career Two-year-old As a two-year-old, Cox sent Bayardo to trainer Alec Taylor's stud farm and training centre in Manton, Wiltshire. Run in a trial, Bayardo showed his talent early by defeating several other two- year-olds and a three-year-old. He was then sent to his first race, the New Stakes at the Royal Ascot, which he won easily under jockey Bernard Dillon. He continued his winning streak throughout his two-year-old season, usually ridden by Danny Maher, including the National Breeders' Produce Stakes, the Richmond Stakes, the Buckenham Stakes, the Rous Memorial Stakes, the Middle Park Plate, and the Dewhurst Plate (beating the filly Perola, who won The Oaks the following year). Three-year-old Bayardo faced setbacks the following season, due to a harsh winter that decreased training time and an accident on frosty ground which left him temporarily lame. Cox went against the wishes of his trainer and decided to run his colt in the 2,000 Guineas. Bayardo finished fourth, losing to the colt Minoru. Following this race, Bayardo steadily improved, and was entered in the Epsom Derby. But problems arose again, this time when the favourite, Sir Martin, stumbled badly in close quarters and lost his rider and hampered part of the field, causing enough of a setback that Bayardo finished fifth, again losing to Minoru. Bayardo continued his three- year-old season in great style, winning every race in which he started, resulting in 11 consecutive victories. This included the Prince of Wales's Stakes, the Sandringham Foal Stakes, and the Eclipse Stakes. In the latter race, he easily won by two lengths, beating several talented animals including Royal Realm (winner of the Dullingham Plate), Santo Strato (winner of the Chester Cup), and Your Majesty (winner of the Eclipse Stakes and the St. Leger the year before). He then won the 1.25 mile York Plate, before entering in the St. Leger Stakes. Going into the St. Leger, Bayardo was favoured over Minoru, the colt who had defeated him in both the Derby and the Two Thousand Guineas. Bayardo went on to win the third classic race without trouble, and then ran only two days later in the Doncaster Stakes, again for a win. The rest of his three-year-old season continued with victories, including the Champion Stakes, the Lowther Stakes, and the Limekiln Stakes, then the Sandown Park Foal Stakes the Liverpool St. Leger. Four-year-old Bayardo's four-year-old season was aimed at the Ascot Gold Cup. His two preparatory races, the Biennial Stakes at Newmarket and the Chester Vase at Chester, were both victories (although just barely in latter, as he won by a head). In the Gold Cup, Bayardo faced the Prix du Jockey Club winner Sea Sick II. Sea Sick II was in the lead for some time, while Bayardo was held back in the field according to the race tactic of jockey Maher. With six furlongs to go, Bayardo decided he would rather take the lead and ran off with his jockey, past his French opponent, to win by four lengths. This race is often regarded as the greatest of his career. Bayardo continued his four-year-old season with a win in the Dullingham Plate, his fifteenth in succession since losing the Derby the year before. In his final race of the season, the Goodwood Cup Bayardo was still thought to be the favourite despite the fact that he carried 36 pounds more than the three-year-old colt Magic. Maher allowed Magic to set the pace, holding Bayardo back. But he allowed too much distance to grow between his horse and the other colt, so that when he finally gave Bayardo his head, he was unable to make it up before the finish, losing his sixteenth straight victory by only a neck. Magic never went on to win any other major race. Racing record * 1908 (age 2): 7 wins out of 7 starts, ¬£13,040 won * 1909 (age 3): 11 wins out of 13 starts, unplaced in two races, won ¬£24,797 * 1910 (age 4): 4 wins out of 5 starts, second in one race, won ¬£6,698 During his career, Bayardo started in 25 races, winning 22, finishing second in another and was only unplaced twice. His career earnings amounted to ¬£44,535. Bayardo's race distances ranged from five furlongs to two and a half miles, showing not only his great speed, but also his versatility. Stud record With his very impressive record on the turf, Bayardo was instantly popular as a sire. Standing at his trainer's Manton Stud, his stud fee soon rose to 300 guineas. Bayardo was Champion Sire in 1917 and 1918, and leading broodmare sire in 1925. He produced three classic winners, two of which went on to win the English Triple Crown. However, his excellent breeding career was cut short after he contracted thrombosis at the age of eleven, paralysed his hind legs and resulting in his death on 4 June 1917. His progeny included: * Allenby: second in the 2,000 Guineas *Bayuda: Bayardo filly, winner of the Oaks *Gainsborough: winner of the 1918 English Triple Crown, sire of four classic winners. His progeny included Hyperion, winner of the Epsom Derby and the St. Leger and champion sire six years in succession, and Solario, winner of the St. Leger and Ascot Gold Cup. *Gay Crusader: winner of the 1917 English Triple Crown and ¬£11,246. * Good and Gay: dam of stakes winning Saucy Sue (stakes winner of ¬£25,284). *Manilardo: winner of the Coronation Cup; *Manton: third in the St. Leger, later one of the top three leading sires in Poland during the 1920s and champion sire in 1930. *Mapledurham: third (both to Bayuda) in the Cheveley Park Stakes and in the Oaks *Pompadour: third in the 1,000 Guineas. Other descendants include: *Saucy Sue: granddaughter of Bayardo, and put him on the top of the \\"sire of broodmares\\" list. She won the 1,000 Guineas, the Oaks, and the Coronation Stakes; third in the Park Hill Stakes. *Hyperion provided the main branch of Bayardo descendants.

SR 130 is a Virginia Byway west of US 29 Business near Madison Heights. Route description View west along SR 130 at US 501 near Glasgow SR 130 begins at US 11 (Lee Highway) in the hamlet of Natural Bridge next to Natural Bridge Hotel. The state highway heads east as two-lane Wert Faulkner Highway, which provides access to the visitor center that serves the underside of the National Historic Landmark. At Natural Bridge Station, SR 130 passes by the southern end of Sallings Mountain and under Norfolk Southern Railway's Roanoke District. The state highway passes through the town of Glasgow, where the highway has an at-grade intersection with a rail connector between the Roanoke District and CSX's James River Subdivision. SR 130 exits Glasgow by crossing the Maury River then meets US 501 (Glasgow Highway) at an intersection east of the river. SR 130 and US 501 follow the Maury River south to its mouth at the James River, then parallel the James River and the James River Subdivision rail line east through the river's gorge through the Blue Ridge Mountains. Shortly before crossing the Rockbridge- Amherst line, the two highways leave the level of the river and have a curvaceous crossing of the mountain. Shortly after the highways return to water level and the CSX rail line crosses to the south side of the river, US 501 crosses the James River into Bedford County to head toward Lynchburg. SR 130 continues east as Elon Road, which veers away from the river and has a connecting ramp interchange with the Blue Ridge Parkway. The state highway crosses the Pedlar River and passes through a gap in Tobacco Row Mountain before reaching the hamlet of Elon. SR 130 continues southeast to the northern fringe of Madison Heights, where the highway crosses over Norfolk Southern's Washington District rail line and intersects US 29 Business (Amherst Highway).

Recorded in the summer of 1973, it is the first of two albums released on Frank Zappa's DiscReet label. It was later re-issued in 1977 by Warner Bros as part of \\"Two Originals of... Ted Nugent\\". Music The album's music featured elements of boogie, heavy metal and progressive rock. Nugent's new, solid rhythm section included Rob Grange on bass and Vic Mastrianni on drums, adding a hard-driving rock beat to Nugent's music. The compositions, developed and gradually improved on stage since 1972 (with an Amboy Dukes' line-up changing frequently), were now sharpened and extended during months of intense touring, in the US and also in Canada. Nugent found new inspiration and energy in a more outdoor-oriented life (on his ranch in Michigan), hence an album title inspired by novelist Jack London. Most of the second side consisted of instrumental and self-speaking music. In addition to the rhythm section, Andy Jezowski (brother of Ted's then-wife Sandra Jezowski) performed most vocal parts on the record, and Gabriel Magno added keyboards and flute (on \\"Below the Belt\\"). Jezowski performed with the group as a part-time guest vocalist along the year. Gabe Magno occasionally gigged on stage with the Amboy Dukes, until he joined the band If by late 1973, and again later on with Nugent in April 1979.

It is the upper layer of two in the iris. Structure The stroma is a delicate interlacement of fibres. Some circle the circumference of the iris and the majority radiate toward the pupil. Blood vessels and nerves intersperse this mesh. In dark eyes, the stroma often contains pigment granules. Blue eyes and the eyes of albinos, however, lack pigment. The stroma connects to a sphincter muscle (sphincter pupillae), which contracts the pupil in a circular motion, and a set of dilator muscles (dilator pupillae) which pull the iris radially to enlarge the pupil, pulling it in folds. The back surface is covered by a commonly, heavily pigmented epithelial layer that is two cells thick (the iris pigment epithelium), but the front surface has no epithelium.

It is made up of all the parts without specific functions of the organ - for example, connective tissue, blood vessels, ducts, etc. The other part, the parenchyma, consists of the cells that perform the function of the tissue or organ. There are multiple ways of classifying tissues: one classification scheme is based on tissue functions and another analyzes their cellular components. Stromal tissue falls into the \\"functional\\" class that contributes to the body's support and movement. The cells which make up stroma tissues serve as a matrix in which the other cells are embedded. Stroma is made of various types of stromal cells. Examples of stroma include: * stroma of iris * stroma of cornea * stroma of ovary * stroma of thyroid gland * stroma of thymus * stroma of bone marrow * lymph node stromal cell *multipotent stromal cell (mesenchymal stem cell) Structure Stromal connective tissues are found in the stroma; this tissue belongs to the group connective tissue proper. The function of connective tissue proper is to secure the parenchymal tissue, including blood vessels and nerves of the stroma, and to construct organs and spread mechanical tension to reduce localised stress. Stromal tissue is primarily made of extracellular matrix containing connective tissue cells. Extracellular matrix is primarily composed of ground substance - a porous, hydrated gel, made mainly from proteoglycan aggregates - and connective tissue fibers. There are three types of fibers commonly found within the stroma: collagen type I, elastic, and reticular (collagen type III) fibres.  Cells * Wandering cells - cells that migrate into the tissue from blood stream in response to a variety of stimuli; for example, immune system blood cells causing inflammatory response. * Fixed cells - cells that are permanent inhabitants of the tissue. * Fibroblast - produce and secrete the organic parts of the ground substance and extracellular fibers of the matrix. Types # Loose connective tissue - This type is mainly located under the epithelial membranes and glandular epithelium, attaching the epithelia to other tissues. It supports the blood vessels and nerves supplied to the epithelia. Additionally, it serves as the main site of inflammatory response within the body. # Dense irregular connective tissue - the function of this type is binding at a high tensile strength between tissues to convert tension from one point.

July 1911 Rudge Multi from 1914 A poster for Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels and their prize for the 1923 24 Hours of Le Mans Rudge Whitworth Cycles was a British bicycle, bicycle saddle, motorcycle and sports car wheel manufacturer that resulted from the merger of two bicycle manufacturers in 1894, Whitworth Cycle Co. of Birmingham, founded by Charles Henry Pugh and his two sons Charles Vernon and John,Driver, Hugh. The Birth of Military Aviation: Britain, 1903‚Äì1914 Royal Historical Society, Boydell Press, Suffolk UK, Rochester NY, 1997, p.14. and Rudge Cycle Co. of Coventry (which descended from a bicycle company founded by Daniel Rudge of Wolverhampton). Rudge motorcycles were produced from 1911 to 1946. The firm was known for its innovations in engine and transmission design, and its racing successes. Their sales motto was \\"Rudge it, do not trudge it.\\" The company also produced the first detachable wire wheel in 1907,Georgano, G.N. Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886‚Äì1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985) and was known for its knockoff wheels on sports cars; that brand continued well into the 1960s. Wire wheels In the early 1900s John Pugh, son of company founder Charles Pugh and a pioneer motorist, decided that there had to be a better way of dealing with punctured tyres than having to change the tyre with the wheel still fixed to the car. In competition with Victor Riley of the Riley Cycle Company they both designed a detachable wheel locked in place by a single large nut. Pugh was granted a patent for his wheel in 1908. There were detailed differences in the design resulting in legal disputes between the two companies over the intellectual rights to the detachable wheel. Pugh eventually lost the dispute following appeal to the House of Lords. The design of the centerlock hub has three main elements - a splined hub to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit the majority of the torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels on the right side of the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely. The system was taken up enthusiastically by the racing fraternity where the advantage of a quick change wheel was obvious. At the 1908 Isle of Man TT race, 21 of the 35 entrants used Rudge- Whitworth wheels, and only one of the finishers didn't. By 1913, the use of detachable wire wheels was universal in grands prix. After World War II the rights to the Rudge-Whitworth wheel was acquired by Jaguar Cars. Bicycles Rudge-Whitworth bicycle ad in Taiwan before 1945 In 1938, Rudge-Whitworth sponsored Billie Fleming to attempt the distance record for the most miles covered in a year. They provided a bicycle with three-speed derailleur gears and a cyclometer, as well as financial support so that she could cycle for 365 days continuously. Her record of still stood at her death, aged 100 in 2014. Motorcycles Selling re-badged Werners in 1909, the company went on to produce their first motorcycle in 1911, a single-cylinder F-head bike. In 1915, a bike, using a Jardine four-speed gearbox, was released, followed by a 1000 cc Multigear. In 1923, the company introduced an in-house manufactured 4-speed gearbox to replace the Jardine, and Multigear production ended. Rudge Multigear Rudge 500 cc TV 1927 In 1912, the belt driven Multigear was released, using variable groove-depth pulleys to provide 21 forward gear ratios, with top gear as high as 2.75:1. (The Zenith Gradua and 1907 FN 244 cc single used a similar system.) In 1913, a Multigear was released. In 1914, Cyril Pullin won the Isle of Man TT on a Rudge Multigear. Together with the Zenith-Gradua this was one of the first continuously variable transmissions (CVT). In 1923, Multigear production ended. Rudge Four Rudge The single- cylinder Rudge Four, named for having four speeds and four valves, showed markedly superior performance to the competition on release, having more power than its predecessor. Rudge engineer George Hack is said to have taken his design idea from the four-valve Triumph Ricardo (produced from 1921‚Äì28). He designed a four-valve head for Rudge George Hack (retrieved 11 October 2006) and in 1924 they produced their first four-valve cylinder head on a 350 cc engine. The valves were arranged in parallel, and were not radial. In 1925, a 500 cc version with linked front and rear brakes appeared, and the big end bearings were now fed oil through the crankshaft pin. The old 350 cc was dropped in 1926. For 1928 Rudge motorcycles were fitted with saddle tanks, and 8-inch internal expanding drum brakes. Stanley Glanfield designed a Rudge for dirt racing, marketed from 1928 as the Glanfield Rudge.The early strutted Rudges did not enjoy much success. However, as the dirt track surfaces became slicker the Rudge came into its own, and by the end of 1930 it ruled the roost. Its success was short lived it would be ousted, in turn, by the speedway JAP. Local Sponend History (retrieved 11 October 2006) Racing Ulster Grand Prix Rudge Ulster 500 cc Racer 1936 In 1928 Graham Walker won the Ulster Grand Prix averaging over 80 mph. This prompted the release of the Rudge Ulster, as well as a JAP-engined 250 cc and parallel 4-valve 350 cc. The Ulster was one of their most famous models. 1930s Isle of Man TT victories Rudge bikes finished first, second and third at the 1930 Junior TT using prototype radial 350 cc 4-valve engines. They also took first and second in the Senior TT. The road bike engines were changed to dry sump lubrication. The JAP 250 and the parallel four-valve 350 cc ended production in this year. In 1931 Rudge released its first 250 cc and 350 cc road machines with the radial-valve layout. TT Replicas were available in 350 cc and 500 cc. The parallel-valve 500 cc was also available in Special and Ulster models, the Ulster now having a 100 mph guarantee. First and second were taken in the 1931 Lightweight TT, and in 1932, second and third. A radial-head 500 cc was produced for 1932 only. A 250 cc TT Replica was built, and the road bikes were fitted with proper oil bath primary chains, and a stand that could be operated \\"with just one finger\\". The Rudge Enthusiasts Club (retrieved 11 October 2006) Motorcycle Speedway During the 1920s and early 1930s, Rudge motorcycles were also popular in Motorcycle speedway. Those who rode them during their career included 1938 World Champion Bluey Wilkinson of Australia who started his speedway career in 1928 on a battered old belt-driven Rudge.http://www.speedway.net.au/release.asp?NewsId=28243 Rudge Cyclecar Between 1912 and 1913 the company entered the booming cyclecar market. Their car used the Rudge multi-speed transmission, with belt drive throughout, offering ratios ranging from 14 to 1 to 3.5 to 1. The ratios were selected by a lever working in a gate which divided the gear range into ten different ratios. The engine was an air-cooled 750 cc single cylinder engine with a bore of 85mm and stroke of 132mm fitted with a Senspray carburettor. The price in 1912 was 135 guineas.\\"The Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia\\", The Automotor Journal, 30 November 1912, p1450 There are reports that the two seat bodies had the seats staggered to fit in the narrow body, but this is not evident from the photograph taken at the 1912 Olympia Motor Cycle and Cycle Car show. Rudge Cycle Car at 1912 Olympia Show Decline Rudge, 500 cc of 1938 With the depression biting, 1933 was the last year of production for dirt-track bikes, and the TT Replicas. The Ulster 500 cc was fitted with a \\"semi-radial\\" (parallel valves with radial ports) cast-iron head. For 1934 the Ulster had its head cast in aluminium bronze, and a radial four-valve 250 cc Sports was released. Rudge motorcycles took the first three places in the 1934 Lightweight TT. A two-valve 250 cc was produced in 1935, and in 1936 the last of the radial four-valve 250 cc model were produced, while round-tube forks were introduced on other models. In 1937 the valve gear became fully enclosed on the 500 cc models, but finances were bad and Rudge was bought by EMI, and production was interrupted, being moved to Hayes, Hillingdon in Middlesex. A 250 cc two-valve Sports was released in 1938, and for early 1939 the Ulster had an RR50 aluminium cylinder head.

James Monroe Maddux (born February 16, 1818) and Sarah Naomi (born June 24, 1824) were married in Georgia and had 12 children. The family moved to Arkansas and then to Olive Branch, (now Brock) Texas in 1876. The Maddux family was very religious and saw at once the need for a church and a school in the Brock community (originally named Olive Branch). On February 7, 1880, land for the churches, cemetery, and school in Brock were given to the community by James M. and Sarah N. Maddux. John Henry Brock, another early settler, purchased land in the surrounding area in 1876. His wife, Polly, ran the post office. Since there were many communities that surrounded Olive Branch, mail was brought to Mrs. Brock to determine where to deliver them. Hence, mail would come to \\"Brock\\" for short. The name Olive Branch was later to changed to Brock, in honor of Mrs. Polly Brock, postmistress. By 1892, the community had multiple businesses, a post office, and a school. In November 2016, local voters approved a proposition to incorporate Brock. At the same time, the nearby city of Weatherford investigated the process of involuntarily annexing land in or near the Brock area. The Brock Independent School District serves area students. On March 2, 2002, Brock won its first state championship in any sport when the Brock Lady Eagles basketball team won the UIL Class A State Championship. The next week, the Brock Eagle basketball team won, as well. The next year, 2003, after moving up to Class AA, both girls and boys teams captured the state championship again, going back to back, a feat that had not been done since 1956 when Buna went back to back, as well. Since then, the Brock Lady Eagles have won basketball State Championships 8 times and the boys, 3 times. The Lady Eagles won state titles in 2002,2003,2005,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013. The boys won their state titles in 2002,2003 and 2015. Brock has since won state championships in every sport: baseball, volleyball, golf, tennis, and track, and football in 2015, after only 3 years since adding this sport to Brock's athletics. Brock has won the UIL Lone Star Cup 6 times, an award that exemplifies the best school in the state in academics and athletics, per classification.

He represented the Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, and was re-elected for the fourth time in 2014. He was a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) political party, and the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. He took voluntary retirement from politics in March 2019. He is not an active politician ever since. Life and work Tathagata Satpathy is the younger son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy and Devendra Satpathy. He is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post. In 2000, Satpathy joined the Orissa Gana Parishad ( a non political outfit), and served as its secretary general. After Naveen Patnaik got elected in 2000, Satpathy had used his newspaper Dharitri to criticise his policies which he does even now. In March 2004, just before the 2004 Indian general election, Satpathy reconciled with BJD. He said that he was forced to quit OGP due its changing into a political party as also forming an alliance with Janaki Ballabh Patnaik-led Indian National Congress (INC). His nephew Suparno Satpathy had unsuccessfully contested him in 2014 for the office of MP Lok Sabha, Dhenkanal. In March 2015, Tathagata Satpathy became the first Indian Member of Parliament to hold an official \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on the content-sharing website Reddit. In April, Satpathy came forward in support of net neutrality, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) come out with a consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services. In December 2015, Satpathy had supported a bill to decriminalise homosexuality. The bill was introduced by INC leader Shashi Tharoor. But, it was defeated with 71 against, 1 abstaining and 24 in favour. Views and opinions On net neutrality In March 2014, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a formal consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services and whether telecom operators should be allowed to charge separately for some messaging apps. Soon afterwards, Tathagata Satpathy wrote an open letter to TRAI stating his support for net neutrality. In the letter, he said such a policy would hinder the Digital India project and kill new startups. He said that he used such apps to interact with his constituency and this policy will hinder his functioning as a representative. On legalisation of cannabis Tathagata Satpathy has criticised the ban on cannabis in India, while pointing out the long history of its usage as a ritual and recreational intoxicant. He has said that cannabis was banned in India while alcohol was not, because of \\"an elitist bias\\" as cannabis was a poor man's drug. He has said the addiction depends on person's character and not on the intoxicant. He has suggested an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to allow recreational and medicinal usage of marijuana. During his \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit in March 2015, Satpathy admitted that he smoked cannabis when he was young. In August 2015, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, he proposed the decriminalisation of cannabis. In December 2015, he repeated his proposal during the winter session, saying that banning cannabis has forced villagers to turn to alcohol. On homosexuality and moral policing Tathagata Satpathy has condemned the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality in India, calling it \\"archaic\\" and called for its repeal. He had supported a bill introduced by INC MP Shashi Tharoor to decriminalise homosexuality during the 2015 winter session of the Parliament. When the bill was defeated, Satpathy called it a very sad day. Satpathy has also condemned moral policing and called for a repeal of laws banning pornography in India. On privacy and Aadhaar Tathagata Satpathy has raised concerns that the Aadhaar project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future. He has questioned why a new identity card project was created despite having several identity cards systems. He has also criticised the decision to present the Aadhaar Bill, 2016 as a money bill. He pointed out that although the bill allows the sharing of biometric under circumstances of national security, there was no concrete definition of national security included in the bill. On religious laws and missionaries Satpathy supports the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India. He has criticised those current laws which are based on various religions, saying that the world is moving beyond religious scriptures and such laws only divide the society. He has also said that a lot of faith-based foreign aid comes to Odisha through missionaries. They offer the poor Dalits free education and jobs, this results in mass conversions to Christianity. Satpathy has said that politicians should use the dictionary definition of secularism to avoid confusion. Other opinions Satpathy has supported the inclusion of Members of Parliament under the Jan Lokpal Bill to curb corruption. In December 2015, he criticised the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 during a debate, saying that the government was favouring big corporations with such laws. He has also criticised the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana calling it flawed and that it looks good only on paper. He said it forces him to choose only 8 villages from his constituency for development out of 3000. Satpathy has opposed the proposal to make Hindi the national language. Satpathy has criticised the construction of new nuclear power plants in India, claiming that most of the world was now moving away from nuclear energy. He has also claimed that Areva nuclear firm of France sold outdated technology to Maharashtra. He has also said that the centre should release the data regarding the safety of nuclear power plants as they are in other countries.

She is the current Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha from Bolangir of Odisha and member of the BJP. She is a member of the National executive of the party. Background and family Sangeeta was born into the minor Rajput nobility of Rajasthan. Her natal family held an estate of five villages of which the largest was Kerote (or Kirot). Her father, Amar Singh, was a younger son and therefore he inherited little, but he entered government service, serving as an officer in the elite IPS. He retired as PR in-charge at the AIIMS, New Delhi. Sangeeta grew up in a middle class milieu and graduated from Delhi university with a BA in political science. In October 1985, and in a match arranged by their parents in the usual Indian way, Sangeeta was married to Kanakvardhan Singh Deo, son and heir of the Maharaja of Patnagarh- Bolangir, an erstwhile princely state located in Odisha. The couple settled in Delhi and became the parents of a single child, a daughter named Nivritti. In January 2014, again in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian way, Nivritti was married to Lakshyaraj Singh, only son and heir of Shriji Arvind Singh of Mewar. Career Kanakvardhan's father and grandfather had both been active and successful politicians. His grandfather, Maharaja Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo, who had enjoyed absolute ruling power within his state during the period 1933‚Äì47, had adjusted very well to democracy after independence, and excelled in politics to the extent of serving as Chief Minister of Orissa during the period 1967-71 as a member of the Swatantra party. Kanakvardhan's father has also been a member of parliament twice. Inevitably, Kanakvardhan was drawn to politics and served for four terms as member for Patnagarh in the Odisha state assembly. The family felt the need to ensure that the national parliamentary seat covering their former kingdom should also be under their control. Kanakvardhan therefore made Sangeeta a member of his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and arranged for her to contest parliamentary elections. Sangeeta won the Bolangir Lok Sabha seat in 1998, 1999 and 2004 and thus was a member of the 12th, 13th and 14th Lok Sabhas. She lost the polls in 2009 and again in 2014 to a member of her own family, her husband's first cousin, Kalikesh Singh Deo, who is a prominent member of the Biju Janata Dal.

As it rarely occurs as squamous or cuboidal epithelia, it is usually considered synonymous with the term pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The term pseudostratified is derived from the appearance of this epithelium in section which conveys the erroneous (pseudo means almost or approaching) impression that there is more than one layer of cells, when in fact this is a true simple epithelium since all the cells rest on the basement membrane. The nuclei of these cells, however, are disposed at different levels, thus creating the illusion of cellular stratification. Not all ciliated cells extend to the luminal surface; such cells are capable of cell division providing replacements for cells lost or damaged. Pseudostratified epithelia function in secretion or absorption. If a specimen looks stratified but has cilia, then it is a pseudostratified ciliated epithelium, since stratified epithelia do not have cilia.  Examples  * Ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia is the type of respiratory epithelium found in the linings of the trachea as well as the upper respiratory tract. * Non-ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia are located in the prostate and membranous part of male vas deferens. * Pseudostratified columnar epithelia with stereocilia are located in the epididymis. Stereocilia of the epididymis are not cilia because their cytoskeleton is composed of actin filaments, not microtubules. They are structurally and molecularly more similar to microvilli than to true cilia. * Pseudostratified columnar epithelia are found forming the straight, tubular glands of the endometrium in females. They are also found in the internal part of the ear.

The name is found in Aristotle as well as Antiochus of Syracuse, but would seem to have been unknown to Thucydides; at least it is difficult to explain otherwise the peculiar manner in which he speaks of the Terinaean gulf, while relating the voyage of Gylippus along the east coast of Bruttium.Thuc. vi. 104; Arist.

Tokyo Blade is one of the many acts considered part of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) movement, which lasted from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Tokyo Blade have been through many changes of formation and have disbanded twice, often changing their musical style during their years of activity. However, the band is still active (as of 2020), with most of the original members in the lineup. History NWOBHM (1978-1985) The band was formed in Salisbury in the late 1970s, under the moniker White Diamond (changed to Killer in 1981 and then changed again, to Genghis Khan). The original lineup consisted of Alan Marsh (vocals), Andy Boulton (guitar), Ray Dismore (guitar), Andy Robbins (bass), and Steve Pierce (drums). After a final change of name to Tokyo Blade, the band signed with the British independent record label Powerstation Records and recorded their first album. This album was self- titled in all regions, except in the United States and Canada, where it came out under the title Midnight Rendezvous on the Combat Records label, in 1984. In fact, this was a compilation of four earlier recordings, dating from when the band were called Genghis Khan, plus four songs from the original Tokyo Blade album. Also in 1984, the band shared the stages of clubs and festivals with notable acts such as Metallica and Venom. Like many other acts from that era, Tokyo Blade was plagued by frequent changes of band members. By the time their second album was released, vocalist Alan Marsh had been replaced by Vick Wright. The album, Night of the Blade was issued in 1984 with Wright on vocals. However, in 1998, an edition of the album featuring Marsh's original vocals was eventually released, as Night of the Blade... The Night Before. In that period, Tokyo Blade took part in tours and festival packages with the likes of Blue √ñyster Cult, Dio, Ozzy Osbourne and Scorpions. The band's third record, Black Hearts & Jaded Spades was released in 1985 on the band's own label in Europe; it was available in the United States as an import. The band filmed a concert at London's Camden Palace, which was shown on TV in the UK on Channel 4 in 1985, and has since made its way onto multiple bootleg DVD releases. By the end of the year, Tokyo Blade had disbanded, with all members subsequently dedicating their time and efforts to other projects. Andy Boulton's Tokyo Blade (1985-1989) Original vocalist Alan Marsh formed another Far East-influenced band called Shogun, alongside former Chinatown guitarist Danny Gwilym. They released two albums, and worked with noted producer Bob Ezrin. Shogun eventually worked with Tokyo Blade bandmates Steve Pierce, Andy Wrighton and Andy Robbins. Guitarist John Wiggins (Deep Machine, Slam) would go on to play in the first edition of Battlezone with ex-Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Original bassist Andy Robbins would be a part of the bands Jagged Edge and Taste, who recorded a single with Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson and later became the hard rock band Skin. Vocalist Vick Wright formed the band Johnny Crash; this being the first project related to Tokyo Blade to appear on a major label in the United States, with the release of the album Neighbourhood Threat. A revamped line-up of Johnny Crash, including future Guns N' Roses members Dizzy Reed and Matt Sorum, recorded a second album, originally called Damnation Alley, which saw release in 2008 on Suncity Records. This album was later re-released under the title Unfinished Business. Original guitarist Andy Boulton continued recording under the name \\"Andy Boulton's Tokyo Blade\\", with an entirely new lineup in place. This new incarnation of Tokyo Blade released the album Ain't Misbehavin' in 1987 and toured on the festival circuit, playing on the same stages as bands such as Black Sabbath. Vocalist Pete Zito then went on to front a band called Inside Out. In 1988, Andy Boulton recruited members of the German band The Dead Ballerinas (featuring former Kin Ping Meh vocalist Michael Pozz) to record the album No Remorse, which was issued on the GAMA International sub-label Hot Blood Records. Like the debut, this album has since been reissued with multiple covers. Following the album's release, Tokyo Blade disbanded once again, with Boulton returning to work with Alan Marsh. Mr. Ice and reformation (1989-1998) Following record company problems which caused Shogun to disband, Alan Marsh formed a group called Mr. Ice, which eventually included guitarist Andy Boulton. As this group now featured two key members from Tokyo Blade, a move from the band's management to resurrect the old name for a European tour with Uriah Heep led to additional issues. Boulton exited the group and was replaced by guitarist Steve Kerr. At the conclusion of the tour, both Kerr and the management team exited. Some of the tracks from the Mr. Ice project were released as a Tokyo Blade record in the mid-1990s. By 1994, Marsh and Boulton were playing together again and creating new music. They released the album Burning Down Paradise on SPV in 1996. Certain tracks were also released as a Tokyo Blade record in the mid-to-late 1990s. The band's early albums were reissued in 1997 on the High Vaultage label, and the latter-period recordings were gathered together by Zoom Club. A live album, entitled Live in Germany was released in 2009. Solo projects and new activities (2008-present) Andy Boulton went on to be in the band XFX, later concentrating his efforts on a solo album and on teaching electric and bass guitar. For a while, Alan Marsh joined the cast of a musical based on the story of Jack the Ripper. Second vocalist Vick Wright wrote a number of screenplays and a novel called \\"South of the Pole\\", worked on the production of a comedy show, and pursued a publishing deal. Bassist Andy Wrighton (Deep Machine, Shogun) and guitarist John Wiggins (Deep Machine, Slam) joined the reformed Deep Machine in 2009, with guitarist Bob Hooker, singer Lenny Baxter (ex-Gangland) and drummer Chas Towler (Slam). Deep Machine split up in October 2015. After more than twelve years of inactivity, a new version of Tokyo Blade was rebuilt by guitarist Bryan Holland, including Andy Boulton alongside new members: singer Chris Gillen, drummer Lorenzo Gonzalez, and bassist Frank Sapardi. This lineup of the band successfully toured throughout Europe during 2008-2009. Andy Boulton quit the band just prior to the band's Autumn 2009 European tour, citing health reasons; he gave Bryan Holland his blessing to continue without him. The remaining members of the band therefore carried on, to fulfil their touring contracts and commitments. Following the conclusion of the 2009 tour and the release of the Live in Germany album, the band's previous lineup dissolved. Andy Boulton subsequently re-enlisted four members of the band's classic lineup: John Wiggins, Andy Wrighton and Steve Pierce, with vocalist Chris Gillen remaining on board. However, Gillen did not perform or record with the band again and was soon replaced by Domain singer Nicolaj Ruhnow. The band recorded their next album Thousand Men Strong with producer Chris Tsangarides, and it was released in March 2011. Tokyo Blade was a live attraction at metal festivals in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. In early 2012, former member Ray Dismore formed a band called Innovator, alongside vocalist Mike Vickers. They have since released several albums of original material. Nicolaj Ruhnow left Tokyo Blade abruptly in 2014, citing a fallout with Andy Boulton, and Chris Gillen then returned to the band as lead vocalist. A reformation of Tokyo Blade's classic lineup occurred in 2016, when vocalist Alan Marsh rejoined Andy Boulton, John Wiggins, Andy Wrighton and Steve Pierce in the band. This lineup recorded the albums Unbroken (released in 2018) and Dark Revolution (released in 2020).

Inoue is the founder of Shinwa Taid≈ç, a martial art which he later renamed to Shin'ei Taid≈ç. He was the fourth child of Zenso Inoue, the patriarch of the wealthy Inoue family of Tanabe, and of Tame Ueshiba, the eldest sister of Morihei. Much of Noriaki's childhood was spent in the company of Ueshiba. He joined his uncle at Shirataki in a settlement expedition in the north of the island of Hokkaid≈ç (1912‚Äì1919) and studied the Daito-ryu Aiki- Jutsu with him under Sokaku Takeda. He was also closely associated with the discovery by Ueshiba of the Omoto sect in Ayabe and his encounter with its spiritual leader Onisaburo Deguchi which had a decisive influence in Ueshiba's later philosophy.Yoichiro Inoue: Aikido's Forgotten Pioneer Inoue then actively collaborated with his uncle into the spreading of aikibud≈ç, the art derived from the dait≈ç-ry≈´ that Ueshiba has perfected. In 1927, the two men settled in Tokyo, teaching at various locations until the construction in 1931 of Ueshiba's first permanent dojo, the Kobukan. However, after the second Omoto incident (1935) when the military government suppressed the Omoto sect, a breach developed between Ueshiba and his nephew, the latter accusing the former of betraying the cause of the sect by not sharing the fate of its leaders, and the two eventually parted ways with mutual resentment. After the war, Inoue continued to teach in Tokyo independently from Ueshiba, instructing US Air Force officers. While the original aikibud≈ç has now evolved into aikido under Ueshiba, Inoue kept teaching his art as such until 1956 when he changed its name into Shinwa Taid≈ç and finally Shin'ei Taid≈ç. He had little interaction with the Aikikai organization which followed the death of Ueshiba and continued teaching actively until his death. He considered himself a co- founder of aikido along with Ueshiba although that is disputed by the Ueshiba family.The ‚ÄúCo-founder of Aikido‚Äù Ignored by History Inoue used various names throughout his life: Kitamatsumaru (1902), Yoichiro (1909), Yoshiharu (1920), Seisho (1940), Hoken (1948), Teruyoshi (1971), and finally Noriaki (1973).The Aiki News Encyclopedia of Aikido, by Stanley A.

The struggle for An L·ªôc in 1972 was an important battle of the war, as South Vietnamese forces halted the North Vietnamese advance towards Saigon. Background An L·ªôc is the capital of B√¨nh Ph∆∞·ªõc Province located northwest of Military Region III. During North Vietnam's Easter Offensive, (known in Vietnam as the Nguyen Hue Offensive) of 1972, An L·ªôc was at the centre of People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) strategy, its location on QL-13 near Base Area 708 in Cambodia allowed safeguarding supplies based out of a \\"neutral\\" location in order to reduce exposure to U.S. bombing. To protect this critical area, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) had essentially a single division in B√¨nh Ph∆∞·ªõc Province, the 5th Division. During the battle, the 5th Division was outnumbered by a combined force consisting of three PAVN and Viet Cong divisions. This fighting which ensued became the most protracted conflict of the 1972 Easter Offensive. On the same day that L·ªôc Ninh, a small town north of An L·ªôc on the border with Cambodia was assaulted, the PAVN 7th Division launched an attack on QL-13 in an attempt to cut off An L·ªôc from Saigon. To control route QL-13 was to control the road to Saigon, roughly to the south. This prevented resupply of ARVN forces in An L·ªôc battle. Battle On the evening of April 7, elements of the PAVN 9th Division overran Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i Base Camp. Its defenders, the 7th Regiment of the 5th Division, were ordered to destroy their heavy equipment (including a combined 105mm and 155mm artillery battery) and fall back to An L·ªôc. Once captured, the PAVN used Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i as a staging base for units coming in from Cambodia to join the siege of An L·ªôc. Key members of COSVN were based there to oversee the battle. On 7 April the 21st Division was alerted for movement from IV Corps to III Corps. On 10 April the first elements of this division were already deployed to Lai Kh√™. On April 8, the small town of L·ªôc Ninh was overrun and about half of the defenders escaped to An L·ªôc. The ARVN defenders of An L·ªôc were made up of several units of the 5th Division, including the Division's 8th Regiment with about 2,100 men; the 7th Regiment which was short one battalion and only had 850 men; the 9th Regiment, most of which was destroyed at L·ªôc Ninh had only had 200 men; Task Force 52, 500 men; the 3rd Ranger Group, 1,300 men; as well as Binh Long Provincial Regional Force, Popular Forces, and People's Self-Defense Forces (PSDF), about 2,000 men. The defenders were later reinforced by the elite 81st Airborne Commando Battalion and the 1st Airborne Brigade, brought in by air because QL-13 was blocked by the PAVN. Because the ARVN defense had little artillery, it was heavily reliant on U.S. air support. Other reinforcements consisted of the 21st Division which was plagued by a very slow move from the Delta area in the south of the country and cleared QL-13 after protracted fighting. The ARVN defenders did have one card to play throughout the battle, the immense power of U.S. air support. The use of B-52 Stratofortress bombers (capable of carrying 108 MK82 (500 pound) bombs on one run) in a close support tactical role, as well as AC-119 Stinger and AC-130E Spectre gunships, fixed wing cargo aircraft of varying sizes, AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) A-37s. These methods worked to blunt the PAVN offensive. At this stage in the war, the PAVN often attacked with PT-76 amphibious and T-54 medium tanks spearheading the advance, usually preceded by a massive artillery barrage. These tactics reflected Soviet doctrine, as the PAVN had been supplied with Soviet and Chinese Communist equipment, including jets, artillery, and surface to air missiles since the beginning of the war. The battle eventually stagnated and became a periodic trade of artillery barrages. This was most probably a result of casualties sustained in the frustrated attacks on heavily entrenched enemy positions in control of a withering array of supporting firepower. On 12 April a relief force of the 32nd Regiment, 21st Division departed Lai Kh√™ to reopen Route 13 to Ch∆°n Th√†nh Camp 30km south of An L·ªôc. The first attack on the city occurred on April 13 and was preceded by a powerful artillery barrage. The PAVN captured several hills to the north and penetrated the northern portion of the city held by the 8th Regiment and 3rd Ranger Group. ARVN soldiers were not accustomed to dealing with tanks, but early success with the M72 LAW, including efforts by teenaged members of the PSDF went a long way to helping the overall effort. The 5th Division commander, General Hung, later ordered tank-destroying teams be formed by each battalion, which included PSDF members who knew the local terrain and could help identify strategic locations to ambush tanks. They took advantage of the fact that the PAVN forces, who were not used to working with tanks, often let the tanks get separated from their infantry by driving through ARVN defensive positions. At that point, all alone inside ARVN lines, they were vulnerable to being singled out by tank-destroying teams. PAVN T-54 tanks destroyed in An An L·ªôc April 15 saw the second attack on the city. The PAVN were concerned that because the ARVN 1st Airborne Brigade had air- assaulted into positions west of the city, that they were now coming to reinforce the defenders. Again the PAVN preceded their attack with an artillery barrage followed by a tank-infantry attack. Like before, their tanks became separated from their infantry and fell prey to ARVN anti-tank weapons. PAVN infantry followed behind the tank deployment, assaulted the ARVN defensive positions, and pushed farther into the city. B-52 strikes helped break up some PAVN units assembling for the attack. This engagement lasted until tapering off on the afternoon of April 16. Unable to take the city, the PAVN kept it under constant artillery fire. They also moved in more anti- aircraft guns to prevent aerial resupply. Heavy anti-aircraft fire kept RVNAF helicopters from getting into the city after April 12. In response, fixed wing RVNAF aircraft (C-123s and C-119s) made attempts, but after suffering losses, the U.S. Air Force took over on April 19. The US used C-130s to parachute in supplies, but many missed the defenders and several aircraft were shot down or damaged. Low altitude drops during day and night did not do the job, so by May 2, the USAF began using High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) techniques. With far greater success, this method of resupply was utilized until June 25, when the siege was lifted and aircraft could land at An L·ªôc. Over the entire course of the resupply effort, the garrison recovered several thousand tons of supplies‚Äîthe only supplies it received during the siege. After making slow progress, on 22 April the 32nd Regiment encountered a roadblock of the PAVN 101st Regiment 15km north of Lai Kh√™. From 24 April the Division engaged the PAVN in a two-pronged attack to clear the road with the 32nd Regiment attacking from the north and the 33rd Regiment attacking from the south. These attacks eventually forced the 101st Regiment to withdraw west on 27 April leaving one battalion to cover the withdrawal for a further 2 days. The 31st Regiment was then lifted by helicopters 6km north of Ch∆°n Th√†nh where it fought the PAVN 165th Regiment, 7th Division, later reinforced by the 209th Regiment, for the next 13 days. On May 11, 1972, the PAVN launched a massive all-out infantry and armor (T-54 medium tanks) assault on An L·ªôc. The attack was carried out by units of the 5th and 9th PAVN divisions. This attack was repulsed by a combination of U.S. airpower and the determined stand of ARVN soldiers on the ground. Almost every B-52 in Southeast Asia was called in to strike the massing enemy tanks and infantry. The commander of the defending forces had placed a grid around the town creating many \\"boxes\\", each measuring 1 km by 3 km in size, which were given a number and could be called by ground forces at any time. The B-52 cells (groups of 3 aircraft) were guided onto these boxes by ground-based radar. During May 11 and 12, the U.S. Air Force managed an \\"Arc Light\\" mission every 55 minutes for 30 hours straight‚Äîusing 170 B-52s and smashing whole regiments of PAVN in the process. Despite this air support, the PAVN made gains, and were within a few hundred meters of the ARVN 5th Division command post. ARVN counter-attacks were able to stabilize the situation. By the night of May 11, the PAVN consolidated their gains. On May 12, they launched new attacks in an effort to take the city, but again failed. The PAVN launched one more attack on May 19 in honor of Ho Chi Minh's birthday. The defenders were not surprised, and the attack was broken up by U.S. air support and an ambush by the ARVN paratroopers. On 13 May with intensive air support the 31st Regiment finally overran the PAVN positions and extended ARVN control to 8km north of Ch∆°n Th√†nh. The 32nd Regiment then deployed into the Tau O area () a further 5km north, where they ran into the 209th Regiment's well-prepared blocking positions which stopped the Division's advance for 38 days despite extensive artillery and air support including B-52 strikes. This stalemate would continue until the PAVN withdrew from An L·ªôc. On 15 May a task force of the 15th Regiment, 9th Division which was redeployed from the Mekong Delta and the 9th Armored Cavalry Squadron, 21st Division moved north, east of Route 13 bypassing the Tau O roadblock to establish a fire support base at Tan Khai () 10km south of An L·ªôc. On 20 May the PAVN 141st Regiment attacked the base at Tan Khai and continued attacking unsuccessfully for 3 days against a determined defense before withdrawing. In mid-July the 21st Division was replaced by the 25th Division and they completed the destruction of the remaining PAVN strongpoints at Tau O by 20 July. On 13/4 June a regiment of the 18th Division was landed in An L·ªôc to reinforce the exhausted 5th Division. On 17 June the 48th Regiment, 5th Division reoccupied Hill 169 allowing them to guide air and artillery strikes on PAVN forces. By 18 June 1972, the III Corps commander declared the battle was over. Aftermath The victory, however, was not complete. QL-13 still was not open. On 11 July the entire 18th Division arrived at An L·ªôc to replace the 5th Division. The 18th Division would spread out from An L·ªôc and push the PAVN back, increasing control in the area. On 8 August the 18th Division launched an assault to retake Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i, but were stopped by the PAVN in the base's reinforced concrete bunkers. A second attack was launched on August 9 with limited gains. Attacks on the base continued for 2 weeks; eventually one third of the base was captured. Finally, the ARVN attacked the PAVN-occupied bunkers with TOW missiles and M-202 rockets, breaking the PAVN defense and forcing the remaining defenders to flee the base. The fighting at An L·ªôc demonstrated the continued ARVN dependence on U.S. air power and U.S. advisors. For the PAVN, it demonstrated their logistical constraints; following each attack, resupply times caused lengthy delays in their ability to properly defend their position.

From the 1930s, Weitz played a major role in acquiring land for the Yishuv, the pre-state Jewish community in Palestine. Joseph Weitz, 1948 (far right) Biography Yosef Weitz in his youth Yosef Weitz was born in Boremel, Volhynia in the Russian Empire in 1890. In 1908, he immigrated to Palestine with his sister, Miriam, and found employment as a watchman and an agricultural laborer in Rehovot. In 1911, he was one of the organizers of the Union of Agricultural Laborers in Eretz Yisrael.Encyclopedia Judaica, \\"Weitz, Joseph,\\" vol. 16, p. 421, Keter, 1972 Weitz married Ruhama and their eldest son, Ra'anan, was born in 1913. Two years later, in 1915, Yosef Weitz was appointed foreman of the Sejera training farm (now Ilaniya) in the Lower Galilee. Weitz helped to found Yavniel, one of the first pioneer colonies in the Galilee, and later, the Beit Hakerem neighborhood in Jerusalem. His son Yehiam (Hebrew for \\"long live the nation\\"), born in Yavne'el in October 1918, was killed in a Palmach operation known as the Night of the Bridges on June 16, 1946. Kibbutz Yehi'am was established in his memory.Tom Segev, \\"1967, Israel, the War, and the Year that Transformed the Middle East\\", Sharon Weitz, another son, followed in his father's footsteps and later took over as director of the Forestry Department. Both the Ma'ale Yosef Regional Council and Moshav Talmei Yosef are named in the memory of Yosef Weitz. Yosef Weitz (right) with Menachem Ussishkin on a visit to Hanita, 1938 Forestry Yosef Weitz addressing group in Canada in 1945 As head of the JNF Forestry Department, Weitz put his visions of Israel as a forested country into practice. He was spurred on by David Ben-Gurion, who told Weitz he wanted a billion trees planted within a decade. In 1949, he proposed a division of labor between the Israeli government and the JNF. The government would engage in applied research in planting techniques, especially in arid areas, and the development of a timber industry. It would also establish nurseries. The JNF would improve indigenous forests, work in afforestation of hilly regions, stop the encroachment of sand dunes and plant windbreakers. Weitz saw plant nurseries and afforestation as a vital source of employment for the masses of new immigrants arriving in the early days of the state. He was guided by the belief that developing a work ethic was imperative for acculturation. In 1966, Yatir Forest in the Negev was planted at Weitz's urging. He described the project as \\"rolling back the desert with trees, creating a security zone for the people of Israel.\\" http://bustan.org/TIMELINE%20-%20%20WEB.pdf Named for the biblical town of Yatir, it is now Israel's largest planted forest. Weitz‚Äôs never formally studied forestry but his autodidactic perspective was reflective of the period. The forestry strategy he crafted emphasized the economic utility of forests and the importance of the Aleppo pine as the hardiest of local species. As a result, Israel‚Äôs forests for its first twenty years were largely monocultures which would soon suffer serious losses due to natural pests. Weitz frequently clashed with the nascent conservation movement in Israel which found the industrial approach to tree planting that the Jewish National Fund adopted to be objectionable. Including Pine tree plantations on Mount Gilboa which threatened an endemic plant Iris haynei (also known as Iris Gilboa).Alon Tal Today, many of Weitz‚Äôs ideas have been replaced with more sustainable approaches to foresting. Views regarding Palestinian Arabs Weitz was an advocate of population transfer. On June 22, 1941 he wrote in his diary: \\"The land of Israel is not small at all, if only the Arabs were removed, and its frontiers enlarged a little, to the north up to the Litani, and to the east including the Golan Heights...with the Arabs transferred to northern Syria and Iraq...Today we have no other alternative...We will not live here with Arabs.\\"Masalha, 1992, p. 134-135 According to Ilan Papp√©, passages in Weitz's diary in April 1948 show his support for the transfer of Arabs during the 1948 war:Pappe, 2006, p. 61-64 \\"I have drawn up a list of Arab villages which in my opinion must be cleared out in order to complete Jewish regions. I have also drawn up a list of land disputes that must be settled by military means.\\"Weitz Diary, 18 April 1948, p. 2358, Central Zionist Archives, Jerusalem According to Efraim Karsh, Weitz spoke of establishing a transfer committee, but Ben-Gurion rejected the idea, and no such committee was ever established.\\"Benny Morris and the Reign of Error\\" http://www.meforum.org/article/466 Nevertheless, Nur MasalhaMasalha, 1992, \\"Expulsion of the Palestinians\\", p. 188 and Benny MorrisB. Morris, \\"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited\\", 2004, p. 312 claim an unofficial Transfer Committee was established in May 1948 composed of Weitz, Danin and Sasson. Later in life, Weitz's views appear to be more conciliatory towards the neighboring Arabs and he is reported to have refused to attend ceremonies dedicated to the Jewish settlement of the West Bank after the 1967 war.

Personal Some track and field competitions in 1987 appear to have been Powell's last ones on the international level ‚Äì and then he was banished from high-level competitions after taking part in a forbidden track and field tour to apartheid-era South Africa. Powell still runs several annual weight-throwing camps with his fellow Olympian weight throwers. Powell also still \\"teaches\\" a few of his young champion-level throwers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, nearly every week. In 2019, he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. His speech at the induction ceremony exhibited he could have been as successful as a stand up comedian.https://www.usatf.org/news/2019/the-year‚Äôs-best-athletes- performances-and-hall-of-  Achievements  * Fourth with 62.82 in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich * First with 62.37 in the 1975 Pan American Games * Third with 65.70 in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal * Third with 65.46 in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles * Second with 66.22 in the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome Powell is a seven time US-champion in Discus throw in 1974, 1975, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 References Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:American male discus throwers Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1975 Pan American Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco Category:Sportspeople from San Jose, California Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:Track and field athletes from California Category:San Jose State Spartans men's track and field athletes Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Congressional Gold Medal recipients ","title":"John Powell (athlete)"},{"id":"7119588","text":"Chandramani Tripathi (1 July 1946 ‚Äì 23 March 2013) was an Indian politician and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) political party.

It was the most numerous 152 mm howitzer employed by Red Army in World War II. Development and production history From the late 1920s the RKKA sought to upgrade its World War I-era artillery pieces. One of the modernized weapons was the 152 mm howitzer M1909, initially designed by the French arms manufacturer Schneider. After a number of experiments it was determined that the muzzle velocity of the piece could be increased to about 395 m/s (further increase could result in a damage to the carriage). In 1930 at the Bolshevik Plant, the gun was experimentally fitted with a muzzle brake. In 1930-1931, the Perm plant developed a modernization project. Initially, the only element of the project was lengthening the chamber to 340 mm (upgraded barrels received a mark \\"lengthened chamber\\"). In late production pieces minor changes in breechblock, cradle and elevation mechanism were introduced. Some pieces also had their wooden wheels replaced by steel ones with rubber tires. The modernized weapon was officially adopted as 152-mm howitzer model 1909/30. The M1909/30 was a typical short-barrel howitzer, intended mostly for shooting with elevations from +20¬∞ to +41¬∞, using separately loaded ammunition. The gun had interrupted screw breechblock; hydraulic recoil buffer and hydro-pneumatic recuperator were both mounted under the barrel. The carriage was of single trail type with limited traverse and, typically, unsprung wooden wheels (some pieces produced from 1937 had metal wheels with solid rubber tires). With the gun was issued limber, which had either wooden or metal wheels. From 1931 to 1941 the Perm plant delivered 2,188 pieces. {border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:60%; background:#fff; border- collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" |- style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;\\" colspan=\\"13\\"Production of M1909/30, pcs.Shirokorad A.

Under the organization of 1939, each rifle division had a howitzer regiment with a 152-mm howitzers battalion (12 pieces). In July 1941 these regiment were cancelled. Same fate befell 152-mm howitzers battalions of motorized and armored divisions. Corps artillery units didn't employ 152-mm howitzers early in the war (they did use howitzer-guns ML-20); but from late 1943 the recreated corps artillery included a regiment consisted of five batteries (totaling 20 pieces), equipped, along with other types, with 152-mm howitzers. By 1 June 1944, there were 192 such pieces in corps artillery. Reserve of the Main Command included howitzer regiments (48 pieces) and heavy howitzer brigades (32 pieces), sometimes organized into artillery divisions. The howitzer was used by the RKKA in the Battle of Khalkhin GolKolomiets M. - The Battle of River Khalkhin- Gol. and in the Winter War. At the outbreak of the German-Soviet War the M1909/30 was still the most numerous 152-mm howitzer in Soviet service. On 1 June 1941, the RKKA possessed about 2,500 pieces,2,432 according to Isaev A. - Antisuvorov, 2,607 according to http://www.soldat.ru/doc/mobilization/mob/table17.html, 2,611 according to Ivanov A. - Artillery of the USSR in Second World War. about twice as much as the newer M-10s, which were soon removed from production. Although from 1943 the M1909/30 was again being gradually replaced, this time by D-1, it was still in service by the end of the war. A number of guns of this type fell into the hands of Wehrmacht in 1941-42; these were adopted as 15,2 cm sFH 445(r). Germans also produced ammunition for these guns.Shirokorad A. B. - The God of War of the Third Reich. Most of the pieces were assigned to coastal artillery. Finnish Army captured 14 pieces during the Winter War, and 85 more early in the Continuation War. The guns were actively used in combat. As a training weapon, the M1909/30 remained in Finnish service until the 1980s. Summary 1 - HE/Frag shell OF-530, 2 - fragmentation shell O-530, 3 - HEAC (anti-concrete) shell G-530. The M1909/30 was a relatively minor upgrade of a World War I-era howitzer, which did not address the main flaws of the latter, namely: * Limited towing speed due to unsprung wheels * Limited elevation and very small traverse A short barrel meant short range, less than that of its main adversaries, such as the German 15 cm sFH 18 (8.8 km vs 13.3 km). Low muzzle velocity and small traverse also made the gun helpless against enemy armor. On the other side, the M1909/30 was rugged and reliable. It was also relatively light and could be set up for combat in 30‚Äì40 seconds. Thanks to it, the howitzer was well liked in the RKKA. In 1930 the Soviet Union still was not ready for development and mass production of modern artillery, so the upgrade of old guns was a reasonable decision. Ammunition When set to fragmentation action, the OF-530 produced fragments which covered an area 70 m wide and 30 m deep. When set to HE action, the exploding shell produced a crater about 3.5 m in diameter and about 1.2 m deep. {border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff; border- collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" |- style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff\\" colspan=\\"6\\" Available ammunitionShirokorad A.

His real name was Maeda Renz≈ç. He is considered one of the greatest contemporary Japanese painters, and one of the leaders of the Nihonga movement.  Biography  Maeda was born in what is now Nakatsugawa city, Gifu Prefecture in 1885. His mother died when he was 13, and he moved to Hong≈ç in Tokyo with his father. In 1901, through the introduction of Ozaki K≈çy≈ç, Maeda enrolled at the art school headed by Kajita Hanko, from whom he received the name \\"Seison\\" in 1902. He met and befriended fellow student, Kobayashi Kokei, whose work influenced many of Maeda's early paintings. Maeda was a member of the Kojikai artistic group from 1907, and of the Japan Fine Arts Academy (Teikoku Bijitsuin) from 1914. He visited Korea in 1915 and China in 1919. Under sponsorship of the Japan Fine Arts Academy, he visited Europe in 1922, touring Rome, Florence, Paris and London for almost one year. Although he was greatly impressed by the frescoes of the Italian Renaissance master Giotto at Assisi, Maeda remained faithful to the traditional Yamato-e and Rimpa styles of Japanese painting, and came to be known for his watercolor paintings on historical themes, primarily portraiture. However, Maeda worked in a variety of genres, including still life and landscapes. One of his most important works, Yoritomo in a cave, depicts medieval samurai leader Minamoto no Yoritomo hiding in a cave in Izu with seven of his trusted retainers after his defeat by the Heike clan at the Battle of Ishibashiyama. The work was completed in 1929, and won the prestigious Asahi Prize in 1930. It is now on display at the Okura Shukokan museum owned by the Okura Hotels in Tokyo. It was also the subject of a postage stamp issued by the Japanese government in 1982, as part of a series honoring Japanese modern art. Maeda became a member of the Imperial Art Academy in 1937. He toured Manchukuo and northern China in 1943 under the sponsorship of the Japanese government. In 1944, Maeda was appointed as an official court painter to the Imperial Household Agency, and taught painting to Empress K≈çjun. In 1946, Maeda became an official judge of the annual Japan Arts Exhibitions (Nitten). He was also a professor at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music from 1950 until his retirement in 1959. Maeda was awarded the Order of Culture and was named a Person of Cultural Merit in 1955. In 1967, he was selected to assist in the restoration work on the frescos of the Kondo Hall of the temple of H≈çry≈´-ji in Nara together with Yasuda Yukihiko. His work was selected to decorate the Shakky≈ç-no-Ma hall of the new Tokyo Imperial Palace. The large painting was completed in 1955.Joan Stanley-Baker. Japanese Art. Thames and Hudson, London. 1984. pg. 194. . It depicts a Lion Dancer awaiting cue from the Noh play ‚ÄúShakky≈ç‚Äù (Áü≥Ê©ã \\"stone bridge\\"). The play is a fifth-category (kiri-n≈ç) play featuring a lion dance (shishimai).http://www.the- noh.com/en/plays/data/program_030.html Two pieces also by him depicting Japanese camellia were added in the 1970s on either side of the lion dancer painting, called ‚ÄúShiro-botan‚Äù in white and ‚ÄúBeni-botan‚Äù in red.http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-about/shisetsu/kyuden- ph.htmlhttp://blogimg.goo.ne.jp/user_image/68/1c/07023ad533f1a14b37be34aa85618120.jpghttp://www.asahi.com/articles/photo/AS20141222003681.html In 1972, despite his advanced years, he was selected as the person most appropriate to assist in the restoration and preservation work of the ancient frescos in the Takamatsuzuka tumulus. In 1974, Maeda received a commission from Pope Paul VI for a painting of Hosokawa Gracia for the Vatican Museums. After Maeda's home was destroyed by the firebombing of Tokyo during World War II, Maeda relocated to Kamakura, where he lived within sight of Kita-Kamakura Station from 1945 until his death in 1977 at the age of 92. His grave is a very distinctive 13-story white stone pagoda at the temple of T≈çkei-ji in Kamakura.

He was elected eight times between 1910 and 1934, serving a total of 11 years. Biography Born in Michigan, Taylor lived in Chicago before coming to Vancouver on September 8, 1896. He briefly participated in the Klondike Gold Rush before beginning his political career. L. D. Taylor championed the issue of amalgamating South Vancouver and Point Grey with Vancouver, and oversaw a variety of public works projects in the rapidly developing city, including the opening of the airport at Sea Island and the Burrard Street Bridge. Amalgamation would take place in 1929 but not under Taylor, because he lost the 1928 election to W. H. Malkin. Taylor was a Georgist, locally known as 'Single-Tax Taylor' for his belief in the economic teaching of Henry George. Taylor ran as a friend of organized labour, although he opposed labour militancy and Communists. The Sun Tower at Pender and Beatty Streets, erected by L. D. Taylor as the headquarters for his Vancouver World newspaper. Mayor Taylor's political career immeasurably benefited from his other role as a newspaperman. He began in the trade working for the Vancouver Daily Province before buying the Vancouver World. The building he had constructed for his newspaper was later taken over by the Vancouver Sun and remains a landmark building in the city, known today as the Sun Tower. Taylor eventually was forced to sell the paper, but not before using it as a political platform from which he railed against Chinese immigration, big business, and other issues of the day that helped establish his reputation as a populist leader. Despite his popularity at the polls, Taylor often found himself mired in controversy. In particular, an exhaustive 1928 inquiry into allegations of corruption in the police department and city hall revealed that he had associations with known vice operators in the city. Although he was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, the inquiry blamed his \\"open town\\" policy on the proliferation of vice and crime in Vancouver. Mayor Taylor claimed that he had no intention of running a \\"Sunday School town\\" and argued that police resources should be spent on major crimes, not victimless vice crimes. This was the basis for Gerry McGeer's 1934 electoral campaign, which obliterated Taylor's political career with the largest electoral defeat Vancouver had ever seen. McGeer was an old adversary of Taylor, having been the lead attorney prosecuting the 1928 police inquiry, and claimed in his campaign that he would eliminate the crime and corruption that flourished under Taylor's civic administration. Taylor unsuccessfully contested several more elections, but spent the rest of his life bitter about the 1934 election. He died in poverty. Taylor Manor, a senior citizens' home in East Vancouver, was named for him in 1946. It was renovated and re-opened in 2015 as a supportive-housing complex for people living on the street with mental health and addiction problems.

One day, he meets Anne Roberts, who signs up as a chambermaid. He takes a fancy to her and lets her in on his racket, conning people out of money. They arrange for married hotel guest A. Rupert Johnson Jr. to be caught in a compromising position with Anne and get $5000 to keep a (fake) policeman from taking him to jail. From there, they leave town and embark on ever grander crooked schemes. Anne falls in love with Bert, but he does not realize it until it is too late. By the time he proposes to her, she has transferred her affections to the respectable Joe Reynolds and marries him. Bert travels around Europe for a year. When he returns to the United States, he is no longer interested in crime. However, Anne tracks him down and asks him for $30,000. It turns out that Joe has embezzled that amount from his employer. Bert does not have that much, but he comes up with a plan. He gets Joe to give the keys to the office and the combination of the company safe. He will break into the safe and steal what is left. Everyone will assume that he also took the $30,000 in negotiable bonds. However, Joe double crosses him; he has the police waiting. Bert manages to speed away in his car, but is shot and captured. When Anne comes to see him in his cell, she informs him that she found out what Joe did. Bert persuades her not to reveal everything to the police, telling her it would not help him anyway. She vows to be waiting for him after he serves his sentence, cheering him up.

Venus On Venus, volcanic features are very numerous and quite diverse, but, like on Mars, none are known to be currently active. These volcanoes range from several to several hundred kilometers in diameter; a majority of them are shield volcanoes. In addition, Venus has unusual types of volcanoes: pancake domes and scalloped margin domes. Most small volcanoes on Venus are nameless. The Moon Due to the low viscosity of most lunar lava, volcanic mountains were seldom created. Instead, basaltic lava flooded large areas, which became lunar maria. Shield volcanoes are known from a few areas on the Moon; they are called lunar domes. Some areas of the Moon are covered with a usually dark coating, which is interpreted as pyroclastic deposits.

The magazine struggled financially for the entirety of its existence (as indeed did Weird Tales); it was published first bi-monthly, then quarterly, during the grimmest years of the Great Depression. Volume 1 of Oriental Stories consisted of 6 issues that appeared on newsstands from October 1930 through Autumn 1931; Volume 2 comprised only 3 issues in the first half of 1932 (Winter, Spring, Summer). After a six-month hiatus, the first of four quarterly issues of Volume 3 appeared in January 1933, but with the new title The Magic Carpet. (\\"Oriental Stories combined with The Magic Carpet Magazine,\\" read the masthead of Vol. 3 No. 1, January 1933.) One notable contributor to The Magic Carpet was popular pulp author H. Bedford-Jones. Still unable to muster sufficient circulation, Volume 4 started and ended with the single issue No. 1 in January 1934. The Magic Carpet was then defunct.

The film which is set in Bucharest, Romania, explores the lives of five children who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to Aurolac. This documentary follows the five homeless children in Romania, where the collapse of communism has led to a life on the street for 20,000 children.  Summary  Children Underground follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with. As the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, they inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintained their distance whilst filming them. One of the children that director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first, this child looked like a young man, but one later finds out that girls have to become tough and look boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta 'Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname 'Macarena' derives from the song \\"Macarena\\", her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled. The filmmakers also follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constan»õa. A similar scene films Ana and Marian as they visit their home, which is also outside Bucharest. Children featured in film Cristina Ionescu: Aged 16, spent her young life in an orphanage where she experienced abuse and beatings. She left the orphanage at age 11 in favor of the streets when they tried to put her in a mental institution. Cristina took on a boyish appearance in order to appear tough, as street girls often face hardships. Cristina is the leader of the subway kids. Mihai Alexandru Tudose: Aged 12, ran away from home at age 8. Both parents drank and his father was abusive. He misses his sister and mother and feels guilt for leaving them. He wishes to have a skill in life, to own a home and go to school. He refuses to beg like the other children and instead helps shopkeepers stock shelves for payment. He cuts himself after the group travels to a park (Ana has a tantrum and takes it out on him) and shows signs of emotional suffering. Violeta 'Macarena' Rosu: Aged 14, lived at the same orphanage as Cristina. Cristina protects Macarena who is quiet and submissive. She is addicted to Aurolac Paint more so than the other children. She prefers sniffing paint over food. Macarena doesn‚Äôt know her real name, her parents or her birthday. The nickname 'Macarena' derives from the song \\"Macarena\\", her favourite, which she loves to dance to. Ana Turturica: Aged 10, ran away from impoverished conditions at home without electricity, food or clothes. She refuses to discuss her home life and says her family loves her and she loves them but it's better this way. After running away, she later returns home, taking her younger brother Marian to stay with her on the streets. Her stepfather attempts to take them home twice but also admits to have \\"checked\\" if she was a virgin. Ana is very troubled. Marian Turturica: Aged 8, is Ana's younger brother. He doesn't like life on the streets and sticks close by his sister's side.  Where are they now?  The release of the DVD allowed extra insight into the children's situations after the initial re-visiting shown in the film. At 19, Cristina was addicted to heroin and was three months pregnant, showing little hope in being able to give up the drug. Her baby was given to a non-profit adoptive organization and she continued living off of the streets using only the income from her girlfriend's prostitution. In 2013, when she was 32, she and her boyfriend were profiled in an article on homelessness in Romania. She was still addicted to heroin and had had three children, none of whom lived with her.https://casajurnalistului.ro/cristinas-street/ Mihai was taken in by a man in Belgium who spent six months looking for him in Bucharest. For some time, he enjoyed education in general schooling and French language before returning to Bucharest to live with a social worker. Marian, at 12, was taken to a children's shelter after a police sweep of the Pia»õa Victoriei and deemed able for rehabilitation. Ana at 14 was living with her parents after the police threatened to prosecute them for child abandonment. Critical reception It currently holds a score of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 7.53/10. Robert Koehler from Variety wrote \\"It's hard to imagine sadder or more infuriating social conditions than those exposed in tyro documaker Edet Belzberg's astonishing \\"Children Underground.\\" This verite look at desperately homeless children surviving on the streets and in the subway tunnels of Bucharest will stir debate and emotions.\\".

The Xbox 360 version of the game was released on June 14, 2007 in Japan, September 17, 2007 in North America, and October 19, 2007 in Europe. The game was also released on the PlayStation 3 with additional content as on September 18, 2008 in Japan, and in North America on October 21, 2008, and in Europe with the original name Eternal Sonata on February 13, 2009.Eternal Sonata to Charm Its Way onto PlayStation 3 in Europe The game is centered on the Polish romantic pianist and composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, who died of tuberculosis at the age of 39. The story envisions a fictional world dreamed by Chopin during his last hours that is influenced by Chopin's life and music, and in which he himself is a playable character, among others. The game's battle system centers on musical elements and character-unique special attacks. Light and darkness play a part in the appearance and abilities of enemies on the battlefield, as well as the types of magic that can be cast. The game features a selection of Chopin's compositions played by pianist Stanislav Bunin, though the original compositions were composed and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba. It is notable for its use of classical piano pieces, educational cutscenes featuring real paintings and photographs (in contrast to the cel-shading graphics of the game) and lush landscape design.  Gameplay  Eternal Sonata follows many general conventions in a typical role-playing video game; the player controls a party of up to twelve characters to explore the world, talking with its inhabitants, buying and selling equipment at shops, and encountering monsters while in the field. These encounters are visible, and the player can opt to avoid the encounter, if possible, as well as gaining an edge on the monsters by approaching them from behind. Experience points are awarded to all members of the party, though at a reduced rate for those not involved in combat, and characters will improve in various statistics with each experience level as well as learning special combat skills. Weapons, armor, and accessories can be used to improve these statistics, which can be purchased through money earned in combat, found in chests, or by selling both equipment and photographs which can be taken by the character Beat during battle. The player may also find Score Pieces scattered about the world, which represent short musical phrases. Various NPCs in the game will offer to perform with the party, requiring the player to match a Score Piece to the phrase offered by the NPC, with the resulting composition being ranked. Discordant matches will result in no reward, but close or perfect matches will gain a bonus item from the NPC.  Combat  Combat in Eternal Sonata takes place in both lit and shaded areas, affecting the skills the player can use While the main combat system is turn-based using only 3 characters within the party, it incorporates elements of an action game. Each character's turn is preceded by \\"Tactical Time\\", a period of time which the player can use to decide the course of action to take with that character. Once the player initiates an action or \\"Tactical Time\\" expires (a function of the Party Class Level), the player then has a limited amount of time denoted by an Action Gauge to move the character, attack the enemy, and use recovery skills or items. Regular attacks are made at melee or ranged distances depending on the weapon choice of the character, and add a small quantity of time back to the Action Gauge, and additionally add to the party's \\"Echoes\\" meter. Special skills which can include both offensive attacks and recovery skills will consume whatever Echoes have been generated to that point, and will have a more powerful effect relative to that number. When a character defends against an attack, there is a short period before the attack strikes where the player can press a button to block some of the damage for the attack, or to possibly even counterattack the blow and interrupt the monster's turn. Recovery and other one-time-use items are kept in a common pouch with a limited capacity; the player must \\"set\\" items in the pouch so that they can be cycled through and triggered during battle. Light and dark areas on the battle field generated by the time of day, environment, and shadows of the characters and monsters will affect combat. Each party character has one or more special skills that are active in lit areas, and a similar number but with very different effects in a dark area. Monsters themselves may have a dissimilar set of powers in the area of the battlefield they are in, while other monsters will actually change form when they move between lit and dark areas. The player can manipulate the nature of areas using special items, but this can also be affected by the monsters themselves, or through dynamic changes on the battlefield such as the shadow of a cloud moving across the ground. As the player progresses through the game, they will increase their Party Class Level. Each improvement in level grants some bonuses while also imposing additional limits on combat. For example, one Party Class improvement increases the number of slots for special skills for each character, but at the same time, cuts down the amount of Tactical Time and time available in the Action Gauge. This Level cannot be altered by the player in their first playthrough, but can be adjusted to the player's choice in Encore Mode.  Plot  The game for the most part takes place within the dream world of Chopin, with brief segments in the real world, where Chopin is on his death bed. The story is divided into eight chapters, with each chapter being represented by one of Chopin's compositions, and being related to events within his historical life. The story begins with a small group of characters wishing to meet with Count Waltz of Forte regarding the mineral powder, but eventually evolves into a far-reaching tale, with political espionage and rebellion being a commonly explored theme. Escapism is also a large theme in the game, one dealt with explicitly in the ending. It starts with Polka, a young girl that has magic, which means she is going to die soon. One day, after being rejected by the citizens of Ritardando, because average people think the magic disease is contagious, she decides that she wants to do something with her life before it ends. The initial party wants to find out why the mineral powder is so cheap compared to the floral powder and to stop the mining of Mt. Rock to acquire it because the mining damages Agogo Forest. As they progress, the party learns that the mineral powder has fatal side effects that would aid Forte's insurrection against its enemy, Baroque. Realising this, the party heads for Forte, but are stopped and taken into the Forte dungeon because Forte was alerted to the planned arrival of the rebellion group, Andantino. Shortly after escaping, the party unites with Andantino and are spotted by the same Forte personnel south of Fort Fermata (which is a short walk from Forte), and fall off a bridge into a river. Half of the party, along with Andantino, go through poisonous swamps to Andante, the hideout of Andantino. The other half of the party were saved by Prince Crescendo of Baroque, with his ship. They encounter pirates and defeat them shortly thereafter. After getting safely into Baroque, the party discuss the situation. Forte is threatening a war, but Baroque wants peace. Crescendo thinks of the plan to assassinate Count Waltz of Forte, but the plan is quickly discarded. In the PlayStation 3 version, that half of the party, along with Prince Crescendo and Princess Serenade, are then warped into Lament Mirror. The party discovers the history of Baroque and Forte. They find out that they were also once at a similar situation of threat to an all-scale war. That half of the party returns to Ritardando to reunite with the rest of the party. As they do, Allegretto leaves the reunion to retrieve Polka from her village. The full party then heads for Baroque and decide to explore Aria Temple, where they uncover a part of the mystery. When the party returns to Baroque, they find Crescendo and Serenade missing. It is discovered that they left for Forte to turn themselves in to prevent war. The party heads for Forte, and on the way (at Mt. Rock), they encounter Crescendo, Serenade and subsequently, Count Waltz. They battle, but Count Waltz completes a potion which turns his partner, Legato into a giant monster. Legato then rips a portal in the air and disappears with Waltz. Realizing that the entire world, not just Baroque is in danger, the party follows them to the city of the dead, Elegy Of The Moon, where souls lost to the mineral powder dwell. The party advances past Xylophone Tower and the Noise Dunes to Double Reed Tower, where Legato made another portal. There, the party defeats them and finally fight Chopin as the final antagonist, for him to complete his destiny. Realizing that it is the only way to save the world, Polka jumps off a cliff and is reborn younger, but then becomes older again and embraces Allegretto. Finally, back in the real world, Chopin's spirit rises out of his body and he plays his piano one last time, in a blooming sea of nocturnal flowers 'Heaven's Mirror', composing a song that was inspired by Polka.

The localization team wanted to be as historically accurate as possible, without losing the original message of the script. On April 23, 2007, the ESRB posted their rating for Eternal Sonata listing the game as being intended for release on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. However, when news of this quickly spread, the ESRB removed the listing entirely. On September 11, 2007, Bandai Namco's official site listed Eternal Sonata as coming soon to PlayStation 3, yet also listed the Xbox 360 version as being \\"available now\\". Again, as news quickly spread, the information was removed. The following day, scans from Famitsu were released, confirming the game as being released for the PlayStation 3. On September 14, 2007 Bandai Namco officially announced Eternal Sonata was coming to the PlayStation 3, during Spring 2008 in Japan. As Namco Bandai had stated, there are features exclusive for the PlayStation 3 version. This includes new playable characters, Crescendo and Serenade, who played a major role in the plot of the game, but were not playable in the Xbox 360 version. It will also include a new clothing system, in which the player can freely change a few characters' costumes, specifically those of Allegretto, Beat and Polka ‚Äì the three characters that are controllable in the field at various points in the game. The other extras are the two dungeons, Lament Mirror and Church of EZI, the former of which is compulsory. Eternal Sonata features a large soundtrack, mostly composed by Motoi Sakuraba, with seven of Chopin's compositions performed by Russian pianist Stanislav Bunin and presented in 5.1 surround sound. Featured music of Chopin's include √âtude Op. 10, No. 12, √âtude Op. 10, No. 3 and Polonaise Op. 53. A Japanese aria composed by Sakuraba titled is also performed by Akiko Shinada for the soundtrack. The game's background music was released in Japan as the four-disc album on July 25, 2007 under the King Records label.  Manga  A manga adaptation of Eternal Sonata was drawn by Mimei Kuroi and published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Comics comic imprint, and the chapters were collected into a single tank≈çbon on September 27, 2008. While it deviates from the game's story drastically, it does reach the same conclusion; in addition, Viola, Falsetto and Claves do not appear at any point in the manga due to the condensation of the altered story, and the roles of Salsa and March are greatly reduced, with the two appearing only briefly and not joining the party.  Reception  Anticipation for the game seemed high prior to release, with the game having reached number four in Amazon Japan video game pre-orders not long after a demo was made available on the Japanese Marketplace, and even number one on Amazon Japan's video game charts not long before the game's release. Famitsu rated the game 9/9/9/8, for a total score of 35/40. During its release week, the Xbox 360 version the game reached second place on the Japanese sales charts at 49,334 copies.GamesAreFun Japanese Sales 6/11-6/17. Retrieved June 20, 2007 The following week, it had dropped to 35th. The PlayStation 3 version debuted on Japanese sales charts at number four with around 34,000 copies sold. Famitsu reported that year-end Japanese sales of the game reached about 70,435 copies on the Xbox 360 in 2007 and 53,314 copies on the PlayStation 3 in 2008. At E3 2007, it won GameTrailers's award for Best Role-Playing Game and IGN's award for Best Original Score on Xbox 360, and was a runner-up in Best RPG, Best Artistic Design on Xbox 360 and Best Use Of Sound on Xbox 360. In 2007, Eternal Sonata was nominated for Spike Video Game Awards for Best RPG, but lost to Mass Effect. The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Eternal Sonata as one of the nominees for 2007 \\"Roleplaying Game of the Year\\", but eventually lost to Mass Effect. In Europe and the U.S., it received many high reviews. GameRankings gave the PlayStation 3 version an average aggregate score of 82.39% based on 28 reviews,Eternal Sonata ‚Äì PlayStation 3, GameRankings and the Xbox 360 version 80.32% based on 57 reviews.Eternal Sonata ‚Äì Xbox 360, GameRankings Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version an average aggregate score of 80% based on 34 reviews,Eternal Sonata ‚Äì PlayStation 3, Metacritic and the Xbox 360 version 79% based on 53 reviews.Eternal Sonata ‚Äì Xbox 360, Metacritic GameSpot gave it an 8.5 out of 10, praising its magnificent visual design, stunning musical score, inventive battle system and great cast; though it admitted that the story is completely linear. IGN gave the Xbox 360 version an 8.3 out of 10, claiming that it had some of the best visuals on the 360 and had great combat. They also stated that \\"the soundtrack is astounding\\" and claimed the story did a great job of educating the player about Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. However, the game was criticized for being too short for a Japanese role-playing game and for the lack of exploration. IGN gave the PlayStation 3 version a higher 8.7 out of 10 and the Editor's Choice Award, with praise for its extension of the storyline, the inclusion of new playable characters, and the inclusion of other extras, such as new dungeons and customizable characters. X-Play gave the game a 3 out of 5 praising the combat, soundtrack and visuals but complained that there were too many mini games, a poor story and too many role-playing video game clich√©s. Johansen Quijano-Cruz of the Eludamos Journal for Computer Game Culture reviewed the game from an artistic and literary perspective, praising it as an excellent role-playing game, particularly for the social criticism conveyed by its storyline. He regards it as a primary example of a video game that \\"makes powerful statements about the society in which we live\\" and \\"incorporates, analyzes, interprets, and offers critical commentary of certain aspects of society\\".Johansen Quijano-Cruz (2009), Chopin's Dream as Reality ‚Äì A Critical Reading of Eternal Sonata, Eludamos Journal for Computer Game Culture 3 (2), pp. 209‚Äì218  References   External links  * Sonata form * Official Japanese website * Official Japanese website for the PlayStation 3 version * Official North American website Category:2007 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Dengeki Comics Category:Video games based on real people Category:Cultural depictions of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin Category:Bandai Namco games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Role- playing video games Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Tri-Crescendo games Category:Video games scored by Motoi Sakuraba Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Works about pianos and pianists ","title":"Eternal Sonata"},{"id":"7119947","text":"Arjei Franklin (born April 25, 1982) is a former Canadian professional football slotback who played for the Calgary Stampeders and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League.

OPI ceased operation on 9 February 2013 and was replaced by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC).OPI's official role was to detect, investigate and prevent police corruption and serious misconduct and to ensure that police members had regard to the human rights set out in the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities.Police Regulation Act 1958 (Vic). OPI reported direct to the Victorian Parliament. History Prior to 2004, criminal investigations in Victoria had exposed alleged links between the underworld and police. OPI was established in response to a widespread concern within the Victorian community about the integrity of its police and the effectiveness of arrangements for oversight and review of police conduct. Prior to this, the police complaints function belonged with the Ombudsman but it was limited to monitoring and reviewing complaint investigations conducted by police. Only in very limited circumstances could the Ombudsman investigate those complaints. The legislation creating OPI included the power to conduct own motion investigations. Oversight OPI performed its oversight function by reviewing police policies and procedures and making recommendations to reform and improve these. For example, OPI conducted large scale reviews the Discipline System and the Management Intervention Model, the Management of High Profile Cases, the Investigative Process Following a Death Associated with Police Contact and Police Use of Stop and Search Powers. OPI also provided educational activities and programs to promote and support professional and ethical behaviour in Victoria Police members. Inefficiency in dealing with Victoria Police corruption In early 2007, Don Stewart, a retired Supreme Court judge, called for a Royal Commission into Victorian police corruption. Stewart alleged that the force is riddled with corruption that the Office of Police Integrity was unable to deal with. Investigations OPI's investigative capabilities included phone tapping powers and specialist high tech and covert investigation methods. Investigations were sometimes conducted in conjunction with the Victorian Police Ethical Standards Department. OPI investigators came from a wide variety of backgrounds and have experience with overseas, interstate and federal police forces. OPI investigations were undertaken for matters ranging from improper relationships, drugs and police and informer management. The Special Investigations Monitor (now ceased) oversaw responsible and correct use of certain OPI powers, including the exercise of its coercive powers.Special Investigations Monitor Hearings From the late 1970s commissions of inquiry throughout Australia identified that traditional law enforcement methods were inadequate to address sustained action against either organised crime or corruption. Since then, specialist independently statutory bodies, such as the OPI, have emerged in most states. It is important to note that OPI and other like agencies have non-traditional powers derived from a convergence of legal processes adopted from both inquisitorial and adversarial systems. OPI conducted a number of public hearings which gained a great amount of media and public attention. In September 2006, an investigation into physical assault by members of the Armed Offenders Squad (now disbanded) culminated in a public hearing. During the hearing, covertly recorded material of the actual incident was played.Armed Offenders Squad members were shown to have committed perjury. This hearing generated strong public debate, with both supportive and critical commentary. A November 2007 hearing involved matters relating to misconduct in public office, propensity of police witnesses to lie on oath, information leaks and attempts to pervert the course of justice. The OPI investigation that resulted in the hearing involved, amongst others, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Noel Ashby (now resigned), Victoria Police Media Director Steve Linnell (now resigned) and Police Association Secretary, Paul Mullett (now suspended). The public interest was immense and media outlets Australia-wide reported the hearing. Corruption Prevention & Education In addition to detecting, investigating and exposing serious misconduct or corruption, part of OPI's mandate was to understand the underlying causes of this sort of conduct. This can result in measures that will prevent it from occurring again. OPI had a dedicated corruption, prevention and education unit. One of the key tasks of the unit was to identify areas of policing or policing systems that are susceptible to the development of corrupt, unethical or unprofessional behaviour. Having identified problem areas, the unit scoped solutions from within Victoria Police or other jurisdictions to strengthen systems, improve ethical and professional standards and reduce the vulnerability of Victoria Police to corruption or serious misconduct. To engage with rank and file police, the unit conducted information sessions in metropolitan and rural regions. The sessions aimed to give police accurate information about OPI and inform them of their rights and responsibilities in the event of an OPI investigation. Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) The functions previously performed by OPI have now been subsumed by the Independent Broad- based Anti-corruption Commission.

Some volcanoes or groups of volcanoes are under surveillance of OVDAS because of their critical activity or proximity to big cities. This list does not include Chilean claims in the Antarctic. { !

D. Appleton and Company) An Outcast of the Islands is the second novel by Joseph Conrad, published in 1896, inspired by Conrad's experience as mate of a steamer, the Vidar. The novel details the undoing of Peter Willems, a disreputable, immoral man who, on the run from a scandal in Makassar, finds refuge in a hidden native village, only to betray his benefactors over lust for the tribal chief's daughter. The story features Conrad's recurring character Tom Lingard, who also appears in Almayer's Folly (1895) and The Rescue (1920), in addition to sharing other characters with those novels. It is considered to be underrated as a work of literature for many. Conrad romanticizes the jungle environment and its inhabitants in a similar style to that of his Heart of Darkness. This novel was adapted into the film Outcast of the Islands in 1951 by director Carol Reed, featuring Trevor Howard as Willems, Ralph Richardson as Lingard, Robert Morley, and Wendy Hiller.

The family was named in 1876 by Othniel Charles Marsh. Pteranodontids had a distinctive, elongated crest jutting from the rear of the head (most famously seen in Pteranodon itself). The spectacularly- crested Nyctosaurus is sometimes included in this family, though usually placed in its own family, the Nyctosauridae (Nicholson & Lydekker, 1889). Modern researchers differ in their use of the concept. S. Christopher Bennett and Alexander Kellner have concluded that Nyctosaurus was not a pteranodontid. In 1994 Bennett defined a clade Pteranodontidae, also including species of the Anhangueridae.Bennett, S. C. (1994). \\"Taxonomy and systematics of the Late Cretaceous pterosaur Pteranodon (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea)\\", Occasional Papers of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, Lawrence, 169: 1-70 However, this definition has not been accepted by other workers. Alexander Kellner, for example, named several additional species for specimens previously classified as Pteranodon, and placed P. sternbergi in a distinct genus, Geosternbergia. Kellner re-defined Pteranodontidae as the most recent common ancestor of Pteranodon longiceps, Geosternbergia sternbergi and Dawndraco kanzai, and all of its descendants. This definition is now contentious, however, as the validity of Dawndraco has been disputed and the utility of separating Geosternbergia from Pteranodon questioned. This clade possibly includes the nyctosaurids. Analyses by David Unwin did indicate a close relationship between Pteranodon and Nyctosaurus, and he used the name Pteranodontia for the clade containing both. Pteranodontids are primarily known from the Coniacian to Campanian stages of the Cretaceous in North America and Japan.Alexander W.A. Kellner, Fabiana R.

Beginning in 2016, Nicholas Longrich, David Martill, and Brian Andres presented evidence of several nyctosaurid and pteranodontid species from the latest Maastrichtian age of north Africa, suggesting that both lineages went through an evolutionary radiation in the Tethys region shortly before the K‚ÄìPg extinction event.Longrich, Nicholas, et al. 2016.

Although it was the last of the three novels to be published, after Almayer's Folly (1895) and An Outcast of the Islands (1896), the events related in the novel precede those. The story follows Captain Tom Lingard, the recurring protagonist of The Lingard Trilogy, who was on his way to help a native friend regain his land when he falls in love with a married woman whose yacht he saves from foundering.  Literary and historical background   Literary  In the 1925 Gresham Publishing Company edition there is an Author's Note that was written in 1920, in which Conrad gives background as to the writing of The Rescue. After he began writing, he set the novel down in 1898 and picked it back up in 1918. Conrad emphasises that he did not set the novel down in despair, but rather he had doubts as to how to handle the subject matter presented in The Rescue through his prose. When Conrad set this novel aside, it was to work on The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'. Once Conrad started working on other novels, he kept working from beginning to end on new stories, and kept setting The Rescue to the side, as the other novels were \\"on the tip of my pen\\" as Conrad wrote. The novels lent themselves to a type of urgency that The Rescue did not. Also in the Author's Note, Conrad says that he picked the novel back up out of pure sentiment.  Plot summary  Part I. The Man and the Brig Young Tom Lingard is the owner and captain of a sailing ship, the Lightning which lies becalmed at night, somewhere in the Malayan archipelago. With his chief mate Shaw he discusses the problems that women can cause. Suddenly they are approached by a search party in a boat seeking help for a yacht which has become stranded on mudflats on a nearby island. Carter, the commander of the boat is interrogated in rather a hostile and suspicious manner which leaves him puzzled, but his boat is put in tow. When they reach the island Lingard handles his brig skilfully, but it transpires that he was heading for the island himself. He fires a warning shot into the interior, then joins the stricken yacht. Part II. The Shore of Refuge The story backtracks to explain how Lingard first came into contact with the Wajo leader Hassim, and their instant bond of friendship. Lingard goes to visit Hassim, but is warned off by Jaffir, who reports that Hassim is now a fugitive in a civil war. But Lingard takes a long boat on shore to rescue him, and the sortie is a success. Lingard begins trading in arms and saving money to help Hassim in the re-conquest of Wajo. He is followed around by Jorgenson, an old sea-captain whose life has been ruined. When Lingard explains his plans to Jorgenson, the older man warns him against taking action, and offers his own life as an example of failure. But in the end, with no future prospects, he agrees to join in the venture, along with his prematurely aged native wife. Lingard has previously visited local chief Belarab to ask for help, and offers him guns in exchange for manpower. Lingard feels that since he has saved Hassim's life, he is tied to him in some mysterious way. He buys the old schooner Emma and runs it aground close to Belarab to use as a weapons store, placing Jorgenson in charge. Part III. The Capture When Lingard arrives on the stricken yacht he is met with hostility from its owner Mr Travers, who thinks he is a vulgar adventurer, intent on profiting from salvaging the yacht. Lingard sees the yacht and its passengers as merely annoying obstacles who have come between him and his plans. The passenger d'Alcacer is in flight from Europe following the early death of his wife and is friendly with the owner's enigmatic wife Edith Travers. Whilst Lingard and Travers trade insults with each other, d'Alcacer takes an instant liking to Lingard and tries to mediate. But the dispute is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Hassim and his sister Immada. Mrs Travers is fascinated by Immada's attractiveness, but the girl and her brother reproach Lingard for recently neglecting them, and leave with him when the interview comes to a fruitless conclusion. On her own after dinner on the yacht, Mrs Travers reflects upon the failure of her romantic dreams. Suddenly, Lingard rows up alongside to talk to her, telling her he feels completely detached from his British roots and more at home with the Malaysians. He wants her to help him by pretending to be frightened on the yacht, so that they will have no alternative but to accept Lingard's offer to house them on the brig. He tells her the whole background story, which touches her romantic sentiments. She feels existentially elated by his frankness and emotional honesty. She is preparing herself to act on his behalf when she is told that her husband and d'Alcacer have been kidnapped whilst walking along the shore. Back on the brig, Lingard reads a letter he has received from Jorgenson describing disquiet amongst the natives who want to attack the stranded yacht. The letter warns of a threat from rival local leader Tengga to seize the arms stored on the Emma. The letter goes on to describe the arrival of Sherif Daman, who also wants the arms for the recapture of Wajo. Lingard receives Carter on board as emissary from the yacht. Carter cannot understand Lingard's or Mrs Travers' motivation in the affair. Then chief mate Shaw protests against Lingard's plans ‚Äì because he appears to be siding against fellow white men on the yacht. Part IV. The Gift of the Shallows Lingard nevertheless goes ahead, and takes Mrs Travers from the yacht onto the brig. He is overawed by her attractiveness and the knowledge that she understands him. He appears to be falling in love with her, but is not aware of it himself. She asks him to rescue d'Alcacer and her husband. Hassim arrives on the brig with his sister and reports on his visit to the camp where the two prisoners are being held. Lingard decides to recapture the prisoners single- handedly, and he puts Carter in charge of the brig. Immada protests that he is putting himself at risk, whereupon Mrs Travers declares that she will go with him, much to the consternation of Carter, whilst Shaw is outraged at being left with no clear orders. When Lingard and Mrs Travers reach the Emma Jorgenson is truculent and hostile . Lingard questions Mrs Travers somewhat jealously about d'Alcacer, whilst she in her turn thinks that Lingard is enamoured of Immada, by who they are joined on board with Hassim. Part V. The Point of Honour and the Point of Passion Travers has been rescued and Mrs Travers has adopted native dress on board the Emma. Travers delivers an embittered and pompous lecture to his wife, criticising her behaviour. They argue about Lingard, about whom Travers is arrogant and snobbish. Travers and d'Alcacer have been released temporarily into Lingard's care. Mrs Travers has had further heart-to-heart conversations with Lingard, and is deeply impressed by his character and his personality. She too appears to be falling in love, but doesn't want to admit it to herself. She would like to share what she knows about Lingard with d'Alcacer, who she regards as a good friend ‚Äì but she doesn't. The story backtracks to describe Lingard's arrival at Daman's stockade to negotiate the temporary release of Travers and d'Alcacer. The manoeuvre is successful because of Lingard's high prestige in the locality. On board the Emma Lingard and Mrs Travers exchange confidences about their earlier lives until they are joined by d'Alcacer, who has been observing their growing intimacy. After dinner d'Alcacer quizzes Mrs Travers about Lingard, who he calls 'the Man of Fate'. They wonder what will happen to them, and d'Alcacer guesses that Lingard will be heart-broken over Mrs Travers. He asks her to give him a sign if she thinks they are about to die. Lingard calls Mrs Travers into his room where they interrogate each other and verbally admit their mutual attraction. Lingard has received a letter from Carter saying that (with good intentions) he has attacked some of the natives from on board the Lightning ‚Äì which automatically puts Lingard's plans into jeopardy. Lingard has despatched Jaffir to find Hassim and Immada, and Jaffir has suggested that the only solution to the problem will be to return the two prisoners to Daman. Lingard and Mrs Travers agree that this must be done quickly. She gives d'Alcacer the warning signal he has requested. d'Alcacer braces himself philosophically for what he thinks will be certain death, whilst realising that Mr Travers is ill with some sort of fever. When it is time for them to go, Travers claims that his wife is in the grip of some sort of fashionable craze, but it is he himself who is clearly delirious. After a heated departure from Mrs Travers, Lingard takes the two men on shore to deliver them up. Part VI. The Claim of Life and the Toll of Death On board the Emma, Mrs Travers regrets the quarrelsome way she and Lingard parted. Jorgenson meanwhile appears to be making fuses for some sort of explosions. As signs of fighting start up on shore, Mrs Travers wants to join Lingard. Hassim abandons negotiations with Belarab and is heading back to the Emma when he is intercepted by Tengga's fighters. Jaffir runs to the ship with Hassim's ring and reports to Jorgenson. Mrs Travers is then persuaded to take the ring as a signal to Lingard.. Mrs Travers is rowed onto shore and reaches the stockade bearing a torch, where Lingard is there to receive her. Because she distrusts Jorgenson and does not realise the significance of the ring, she does not pass on to Lingard the message it represents. Lingard, d'Alcacer, and Mrs Travers talk to each other in turn around a fire. The Spaniard is mainly concerned with the possibility of being murdered the next day, whilst Lingard thinks Mrs Travers could not help herself but join him. She accepts his devotion and tells him nothing, so as not to disturb him. Meanwhile an envoy from Tengga fails to persuade Jorgenson to leave the Emma. Two days later, following an explosion of some kind, Lingard is on the Lightning where Carter relates rescuing Jaffir. Lingard recalls in flashback awakening alongside Mrs Travers and being summoned to see Belarab. Belarab has been informed through spies of all elements of Daman's and Tengga's machinations. In the morning mists there appear to be attacks imminent, but when a flotilla of canoes surrounds the Emma, Jorgenson blows up the ship, whereupon Belarab releases the prisoners. Jaffir's story continues with his escape from the Emma. He tells Lingard about the ring, then dies. Lingard takes Carter as mate on the Lightning then invites Mrs Travers by letter to meet him on shore. Next morning d'Alcacer rows Mrs Travers out where she meets Lingard. She wants to confess about the undelivered ring, but he already knows the truth and tells her it would not have made any difference. She departs, returns to the yacht, and throws the ring into the sea. The yacht and the Lightning depart in opposite directions.  Genre and style   Genre  The genre of The Rescue is adventure, specifically a sea story. From the beginning, readers are shown that the novel takes place at sea. There are many times when Lingard refers to himself as an adventurer or being on an adventure. Throughout the text, there are lengthy passages in which the plot comes to a halt while the stifling darkness is described. This helps create the atmosphere of an adventure novel as readers are held in suspense along with the characters. The British characters are constantly interacting with natives, a trope that is used in many adventure novels. Many adventure novels also have an exotic other, the role that the Malay tribes fill in The Rescue.  Style  The Rescue is written as a narrative, with an omniscient narrator. The story is told through a sequence of unannounced time shifts, both forwards and backwards, a technique which permeates his major works.  Critical reception  Very shortly after publication in 1920, a book review came out in \\"The Sewanee Review\\" in which G.H.C. said that The Rescue is \\"deeply and sincerely imaginative\\", and \\"is Conrad at his best\\"G.H.C. \\"The Rescue by Joseph Conrad.\\" Rev. of The Rescue by Joseph Conrad. Sewanee Review 4 October 1920: 597‚Äì99. Jstor. Web. 20 April 2014. Also in 1920, The New York Times published an article on The Rescue, in which the 20-year delay from beginning to end of the novel is discussed.Field, Louise Maunsell. \\"CONRAD'S ART SPANS TWO DECADES: Unique Task Accomplished in \\"The Rescue\\"\\" Rev. of The Rescue by Joseph Conrad. New York Times 23 May 1920: BR1. ProQuest Historical Newspapers. Web. 25 April 2014. Louise Maunsell Field writes that there is a noticeable change in writing style, but it comes at a point where the narrative demands expediency. There is \\"an increased depth of understanding, an increased subtlety of characterization, of thought, of style\\". Field also says, \\"the book is absorbingly interesting: dramatic, subtle, fascinating with allurement\\". Heliena Krenn says ‚ÄúIt was the Malay Archipelago with its truths about human life dimmed by the mists of its jungles and waterways that started Conrad on his career as a novelist‚Äù. She is arguing that without the Lingard Trilogy, Conrad's other works on colonialism and imperialism would not have been as powerful. She also argues that to completely understand other works such as Heart of Darkness or Lord Jim, readers must look closely at the Lingard Trilogy. Krenn also points out that the three books must be read as one unit, that actions portrayed in one affect the other two.Krenn, Heli√©na. Conrad's Lingard Trilogy: Empire, Race, and Women in the Malay Novels. New York: Garland Pub., 1990. Print. Looking specifically at The Rescue, Krenn points out that the novel had many omissions in its final publication. According to Krenn, those omissions show Lingard's adventure as an \\"intended subversion of the interests of European colonial authorities and his motivation as rooted in ambitions for power, the emphasis and attention of the narrative shift to Lingard's conflict of divided loyalties\\". According to David Thorburn, Conrad intended for The Rescue to be a boys' book, similar to Robert Louis Stevenson's works.Thorburn, David. Conrad's Romanticism. New Haven: Yale UP, 1974. Print. Thorburn quotes Garnett's Letters from Conrad, ‚ÄúI want to make it a kind of glorified book for boys ‚Äì you know. No analysis. No damned mouthing. Pictures ‚Äì pictures ‚Äì pictures. That's what I want to do‚Äù. Thorburn does not think highly of The Rescue or of Conrad's ‚Äúgrandiose subtitles‚Äù; when comparing The Rescue to other works, he briefly mentions it as one of the ‚Äúdisappointing novels‚Äù and claims that the excess titling was an expression of weakness. Thorburn also argues that the character of Tom Lingard is a failure and unconvincing because ‚Äúthe mythic or archetypal collapses back into stereotype when it is too much insisted upon\\". Thorburn says that Lingard is \\"intended to hint at epic qualities. But such qualities do not bear too much repeating, and they are reiterated beyond tolerable limits\\".

He belongs to the House of Scindia that once ruled in Gwalior and a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha representing the State of Madhya Pradesh. He is a former Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha, representing the Guna constituency in Madhya Pradesh until his defeat in the 2019 Indian general election. He is a former member of the Indian National Congress (INC) and presently a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While a member of the INC, Scindia was a Minister of State with independent charge for Power in the cabinet of prime minister Manmohan Singh from October 2012 until May 2014. In March 2020, he severed all ties with Congress and joined BJP. Early life and education Scindia was born on 1 January 1971 in Bombay to Madhavrao Scindia and Madhavi Raje Scindia. He claims to belong to the Kurmi caste. He was educated at Campion School, Mumbai and at The Doon School, Dehradun. Scindia was admitted to St. Stephen's College, Delhi, University of Delhi. He later transferred to Harvard College, the undergraduate liberal arts college of Harvard University, where he graduated with BA degree in Economics in 1993. In 2001, he received a Master of Business Administration from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Scindia is a grandson of Jivajirao Scindia, the last Maharaja of the princely state of Gwalior, who, although joining the Dominion of India in 1947, was allowed his former titles and privileges, including an annual remuneration called the privy purse. Upon his death in 1961, his son, Madhavrao Scindia (Jyotiraditya's father) became titular Maharajah of Gwalior, as the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India promulgated in 1971, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and privy purses.1\\\\. , \\"Through a constitutional amendment passed in 1971, Indira Gandhi stripped the princes of the titles, privy purses and regal privileges which her father's government had granted.\\" (p 278). 2. Quote: \\"The princes of India ‚Äì their number and variety reflecting to a large extent the chaos that had come to the country with the break up of the Mughal empire ‚Äì had lost real power in the British time. Through generations of idle servitude they had grown to specialize only in style. A bogus, extinguishable glamour: in 1947, with Independence, they had lost their state, and Mrs. Gandhi in 1971 had, without much public outcry, abolished their privy purses and titles.\\" (pp 37‚Äì38). 3. Quote: \\"Although the Indian states were alternately requested or forced into union with either India or Pakistan, the real death of princely India came when the Twenty-sixth Amendment Act (1971) abolished the princes' titles, privileges, and privy purses.\\" (page 78). 4. Quote: \\"The third stage in the political evolution of the princes from rulers to citizens occurred in 1971, when the constitution ceased to recognize them as princes and their privy purses, titles, and special privileges were abolished.\\" (page 84). 5. Quote: \\"Her success at the polls emboldened Mrs. Gandhi to act decisively against the princes. Through 1971, the two sides tried and failed to find a settlement. The princes were willing to forgo their privy purses, but hoped at least to save their titles. But with her overwhelming majority in Parliament, the prime minister had no need to compromise. On 2 December she introduced a bill to amend the constitution and abolish all princely privileges. It was passed in the Lok Sabha by 381 votes to six, and in the Rajya Sabha by 167 votes to seven. In her own speech, the prime minister invited 'the princes to join the elite of the modern age, the elite which earns respect by its talent, energy and contribution to human progress, all of which can only be done when we work together as equals without regarding anybody as of special status.' \\" (page 441). 6. Quote: \\"The Indian princes survived the British Raj by only a few years. The Indian republic stripped them of their powers and then their titles.\\" (page 10). 7. Quote: \\"Indian States: \\"Various (formerly) semi- independent areas in India ruled by native princes .... Under British rule ... administered by residents assisted by political agents. Titles and remaining privileges of princes abolished by Indian government 1971.\\" (page 520). 8. Quote: \\"A monarchy is only as good as the reigning monarch: thus it is with the princely states. Once they seemed immutable, invincible. In 1971 they were \\"derecognized,\\" their privileges, privy purses and titles all abolished at a stroke\\" (page 91) Scindia's mother, Madhavi Raje Scindia (Kiran Rajya Lakshmi Devi), was great-granddaughter of the Prime Minister of Nepal and Maharaja of Kaski and Lamjung, Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, a patrilineal descendant of Ramakrishna Kunwar of Gorkha. He is married to Priyadarshini Raje Scindia (nee Gaekwad) of the Gaekwad family of Baroda. His grandmother, Vijayraje Scindia, was among the BJP's founder members. He has a son and a daughter. Political career Early political career On 30 September 2001, the Guna constituency fell vacant due to the death of Scindia's father the sitting MP Madhavrao Scindia in an airplane crash in Uttar Pradesh. On 18 December, he formally joined the INC and pledged to uphold the \\"secular, liberal and social justice values\\" of his father. On 24 February, Scindia won the by-election in Guna, defeating his nearest rival, Desh Raj Singh Yadav of the BJP, by a margin of approximately 450,000 votes. He was re-elected in May 2004, and was introduced to the Union Council of Ministers in 2007 as Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology. He was then re-elected in 2009 for a third consecutive term and became Minister of State for Commerce and Industry. Scindia in 2008 as Minister of State for Communications & Information Technology Scindia was appointed Minister of State for Power in November 2012 in a cabinet reshuffle which drafted a number of younger politicians into the Indian cabinet, including two other scions of princely families, R. P. N. Singh and Jitendra Singh. Scindia was among the richest ministers in the UPA government with assets nearly Rs. 25 crore ($5 million) including investments in Indian and foreign securities worth over and jewellery worth over . In 2010, he filed a legal claim to be the sole inheritor of the property belonging to his late father worth , however this was challenged in court by his aunts. Scindia was tasked by the Indian Planning Commission with preventing a repetition of the July 2012 India blackout, the largest power outage in history, which affected over 620 million people, about 9% of the world population, In May 2013, Scindia claimed that checks and balances had been put in place to prevent any recurrence of grid collapse and that India would have the world's largest integrated grid by January 2014. In 2014, Scindia was elected from Guna but lost that seat to Krishna Pal Singh Yadav in 2019. Bharatiya Janata Party Citing disgruntlement with the INC leadership, he quit the party on to join the BJP. The party then released a statement claiming that he had been expelled for \\"anti-party activities\\". He later joined the BJP on 11 March 2020. Other MLAs loyal to him also resigned from the INC and their MLA posts in a political crisis that led to the resignation of Kamal Nath as Chief Minister. On 19 June 2020, Scindia was elected a BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh. Other roles Scindia is chairman of the regional Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) in India. After the spot fixing scandal in the Indian Premier League exploded in the media and Sanjay Jagdale, a member of the MPCA resigned from his job as secretary from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Scindia spoke out against corruption in Indian cricket.

It features Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner and was directed by Chuck Jones, who introduced the pair in 1949. The short was owned by Warner Bros. Family Entertainment via Warner Animation Group. As in other shorts of the Road Runner series, Wile E. tries to catch his potential prey through use of various devices. This film's soundtrack uses music from the Bed≈ôich Smetana opera The Bartered Bride. It was released in North American theaters preceding the film, Richie Rich. It was the first time a new short of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner had been released theatrically since 1966. This was the final Coyote/Road Runner short to be directed by Jones. The title is a parody of Chariots of Fire. Plot Introduction: At the beginning, we see the Road Runner (Boulevardius Burnupius) giving Wile E. a \\"come-on\\" to chase him, and the camera moves to Wile and freezes to show his Latin name, (Dogius Ignoramii). The chase continues until the coyote stops to read a sign in the road: \\"WARNING: The Surgeon General has determined that chasing Road Runners may be hazardous to your health.\\" He dismisses this sign as cheesy and laughs at it, before the Road Runner pulls up behind him and beeps the coyote into another headache. Within the outcropping, Wile recovers and sees another sign posted at the very end of the outcropping: \\"It's not cool to laugh at the Surgeon General.\\" 1\\\\. Not deterred by this one bit, the coyote continues his dastardly plans: he leaves the Road Runner a free snack on the edge of a cliff while he sneaks up behind his enemy and tries to eat him. However, sensing the danger, the Road Runner extends his neck all the way around the screen and beeps in the back of the coyote. To explain this, he displays a sign that says \\"Road Runners are extremely flexible\\" and leaves the scene, while Wile E. falls back onto the cliff and is left looking like an accordion. 2\\\\. In a similar scheme to one used in the previous cartoon, Wile now locks and loads an ACME Giant Mouse Trap and leaves it in the road for the Road Runner to trip. When the trap snaps, the coyote jumps out to capture his opponent, but meets a giant mouse who is rather displeased with getting his tail caught and returns the favor to Wile's tail. 3\\\\. Still trying to make this gadget work, despite his failures with it, the coyote loads himself into a spring attached to a rock and lets go as the Road Runner passes. Voices of Spring plays on the music track as Wile E. ends up being carried across the plateau. Wile E. eventually moves into thin air, and soon catches on to the situation, gulps, and falls. As the spring unfurls through the air like a Slinky, the Road Runner ducks as the rock just misses him and dives all the way through the spring, ultimately landing on Wile, displaying a \\"HAVE MERCY\\" sign, just as he recovers from his massive fall. The coyote leaves this with his neck also coiled up like a Slinky. 4\\\\. With these newer cartoons come more ludicrous products, such as ACME Instant Road, which Wile E. rolls out across an arch and down the straight slope in an effort to get the Road Runner to follow him, until he runs out of road and he is left staring at the ground. He can only display a sign that says \\"In heaven's name - what am I doing?\\" (seen in the previous cartoon as well, but in distinctly older style) before he is overtaken by gravity and displays a \\"BYE!\\" sign. 5\\\\. Returning to conventional chasing and gags, the coyote tries to launch himself with a bow to chase the Road Runner, but the bow simply freezes without firing. He hangs in midair for a couple seconds before he realizes this, and attempts to fix it by playing dulcimer to the melody \\"Those Endearing Little Charms\\" on the bowstring, until it activates and Wile spears a cactus. However, this gives the coyote a new idea, displayed by a lightbulb changing from \\"IDEA\\" to \\"CACTUS\\" repeatedly. 6\\\\. The ACME Trick-or-Treat Cactus Costume has arrived, and Wile puts it on, suffering rather discomfiting pain in the process. Finally, he gets it on and hops out into the road while the Road Runner is passing him. However, he fails to grab the Road Runner and wraps his arms around himself, causing massive pain due to the spines. After Wile escapes from the costume, he kicks its box into the desert. 7\\\\. As the Road Runner pulls up to another outcropping and signals to the coyote, Wile attempts to see-saw his way over to his rival with a rock and board. However, when the rock lands on the other side, it causes the board to smash into the coyote, and the rock then lands on the thin edge of the board, resulting in it wedging the edge of the outcropping away. This falls to the earth, with Wile, the board, the rock, and two smaller rocks located next to the see-saw following it. As the board looms over the coyote, Wile heaves it into the air before a rock hits the ground, then the outcropping edge, followed by the coyote on the right and the other rock on the left. This causes the coyote to be thrown upwards and bump his head directly on the falling board before he drops on the right side of the outcropping edge and jumps the second rock onto himself, as the board wedges just to the right. 8\\\\. Another rather ludicrous ACME product: ACME Lightning Bolts (with rubber gloves) - takes up the remainder of the cartoon. With the safety gloves, the coyote grabs a lightning bolt and successfully sizzles a practice saguaro. He throws a second one at the Road Runner, who stops and takes stock of the situation, and turns the other way as the electricity chases him. The bolt and bird chase all over the mountains until the lightning overtakes the Road Runner, who beeps at the lightning to get it to reverse. The chase returns all the way back the way it came until the Road Runner escapes to safety up a mountain slope, while the lightning continues on its normal course - back to its thrower! Wile E.'s eyes pop out and clash with each other in reaction before following the rest of him on the run from the lightning. The hapless coyote is repeatedly prodded with white-hot lightning across the landscape and towards the setting sun. Availability The short was released by Warner Home Video on various formats. The first being a VHS entitled Road Runner & Wile E Coyote: Looney Tunes, Chariots of Fur with other various cartoons. Later on, the cartoon was included, in widescreen and pan- and-scan versions, in the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote: Supergenius Hijinks DVD.

He went on to graduate study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he received a masters in 1961 and a Ph.D. in 1964. In The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation (1998 ), Ferrill supports the claims of Vegetius, about increased \\"barbarisation\\" and \\"germanisation\\" helping to cause the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD. He asserts that allowing barbarians to settle within Rome's borders, to act as a buffer zone against other barbarians, created friction and led to a decrease in the size of the Roman Empire's Borders. He also states that the Germans were recruited in such large numbers by the Western empire that they in fact changed it from a Roman to a German culture. For example, field army units would not use their helmets, the pilum was replaced, and the standard of drill declined, leading to a lack of military skill within the Empire.

Ogle & Company: 1904, Biographical Sketch of Pierre Bottineau, pg. 144 Known as the \\"Kit Carson of the Northwest,\\" he was an integral part of the history and development of Minnesota and North Dakota. He was an accomplished surveyor and his many settlement parties founded cities all over Minnesota and North Dakota. Those settlements would become cities such as Osseo, Minnesota and Maple Grove, Minnesota northwest of the Twin Cities, as well as Breckenridge, Minnesota and Wahpeton, North Dakota on either side of the Red River of the North. He also took part in the founding of Orono Village, Sherburne County, Minnesota (later absorbed by), Elk River, Minnesota and the booming city of St. Anthony (later absorbed by Minneapolis, Minnesota). He was also a renowned diplomat and translator, earning him the nickname \\"The Walking Peace Pipe.\\" He played a part in forging many treaties with Native American tribes. According to his obituary he spoke French, English, Dakota, Ojibwe, Cree, Mandan, and Winnebago. Pierre was born in a hunting camp on the buffalo trail near Grand Forks. His father Charles Bottineau was a French-Canadian, and his mother Marguerite Macheyquayzaince Ahdicksongab \\"(Clear Sky Woman)\\" was half Dakota and half Ojibwe of the Lake of the Woods band, and sister of the Pembina Ojibwe chief Misko-Makwa or Red Bear. Although technically born in United States territory, control of the Upper Mississippi Valley fell to the British during the War of 1812. Even after the 1815 Treaty of Ghent returned the land to the United States, British and Canadian traders and the Native American tribes held all real control in the area. The U.S. government used Pierre and others like him to settle the land and help establish American sovereignty. Most mixed race, or M√©tis, lived as outcasts to both White and Native societies, but Pierre's invaluable services and exploits would make him a legend in his own time. Upon his retirement, the United States Congress granted him a pension of $50 a month. He died in Red Lake Falls, Minnesota at the age of 78. Bottineau County, North Dakota, and its county seat Bottineau, North Dakota, are named in his honor as well as the Pierre Bottineau Library and Bottineau Park in Minneapolis and Bottineau Blvd in Hennepin County, Minnesota.

History  Mount TmolusIn 88 BC, Hypaepa rebelled against Mithridates VI of Pontus and was severely punished. Under Roman Emperor Tiberius (AD 14-37) it was selection as a candidate for the location of a temple dedicated to worship of the Emperor, but was rejected as being too insignificant. In fact, the Roman poet Ovid contrasted the great city of Sardis with what he called \\"little Hypaepa\\": Sardibus hinc, illinc parvis finitur Hypaepis.Ovid, Metamophoses, 11.146, l. 152; English verse translation Coinage of Hypaepa of the 3rd century AD are extant, until the time of Emperor Gallienus. To judge by the number of Byzantine churches that it contained, Hypaepa flourished under the Byzantine Empire.  Mythology and pre-christian religion  The women of Hypaepa were reputed to have received from the mythological Aphrodite the gift of beauty of form and dancingSophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Hypaepa\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) Ovid placed at Hypaepa the home of Arachne before she was turned into a spider.Ovid, Metamorphoses, VI The Persian goddess Anahita, identified with Artemis and therefore called Artemis Anaitis or Persian Artemis, was worshipped at Hypaepa, which had been part of the Achaemenid Empire. However, under the Roman Empire the priests of the temple bore Greek names, not Persian. Pausanias mentions a rite performed in Hypaepa, in which wood was set alight apparently by magic.Pausanias V 27:5-6 text at Perseus There was a temple of Priapus at the city.Petronius, Satyricon, ¬ß133 An inscription from the synagogue of Sardis mentions a benefactor who was a member of the council of Hypaepa, indicating the presence there of a Jewish community.  Ecclesiastical history   Bishopric  Hypaepa was an episcopal see, one of many suffragans of Ephesus, the metropolitan see of the late Roman province of Asia Prima. It remained active until the 13th century. Under Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelus Comnenus (1185-1195 and 1203-1204) it became a Metropolitan see. Lequien (Oriens Christianus I, 695) mentions six bishops: Mithres, present at the First Council of Nicaea in 325; Euporus, at the First Council of Ephesus in 431; Julian, at Ephesus, 449, and at the Council of Chalcedon in 451; Anthony, who abjured Monothelism at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680; Theophylactus, at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787; Gregory, at the Council of Constantinople in 879. To these may be added Michael, who in 1230 signed a document issued by the Patriarch Germanus II (Revue des √©tudes grecques, 1894, VII).

It was originally active from 2003 to 2014; after a five-year hiatus, the group reformed in 2019. The band is composed of singer and guitarist Erlend √òye of Kings of Convenience, bassist Marcin √ñz, drummer Sebastian Maschat, and Daniel Nentwig on Rhodes piano and Crumar.  History  The Whitest Boy Alive started as an electronic dance music project in 2003 in Berlin, but since slowly developed into a band with no programmed elements. The name of the band comes from the idea of a na√Øve, shy northern European boy that their music is about. The band's German record label was Bubbles. Their debut album Dreams was released on 21 June 2006 in Germany. In July 2007, Modular Records signed them to their UK imprint and the band played their first UK performance with New Young Pony Club at the London Astoria in September 2007. The album was released in the UK with the single \\"Burning\\" in November 2007. The band released their second album Rules in March 2009. It was recorded in a newly built studio located on Punta Burros, Nayarit, Mexico. Their single \\"1517\\" was also featured in the soundtrack of the video-game FIFA 10. The band started The Whitest Boy Alive + The New Wine tour in April, 2009, visiting Germany, Denmark, United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden. In 2011 the band travelled to China with promoters Split Works. In June 2014, the band announced via their Facebook page that they were \\"no longer composing or playing together as The Whitest Boy Alive.\\" On August 4, 2017, Erlend √òye announced via Facebook that The Whitest Boy Alive would perform a 45-minute one-off reunion show on Sunday 20, August 2017 in Siracusa, Italy, to celebrate the birthdays of Marcin Oz and Daniel Nentwig. Further, on September 3, 2019, the band announced via their Facebook page that they would play Fauna festival in Chile on November 9 of the same year and expressed an interest in booking further shows, with the conditions they play shorter sets and less frequently than before, due to frontman Erlend √òye's tinnitushttps://www.facebook.com/ErlendOyeOfficial/posts/at-midnight-european- time-you-can-listen-to-la-comitivas-version-of-for-the-time/2863324163687236/. On March 5, 2020, after more than a decade without releasing any new material, the band released a new single, \\"Serious\\", which was recorded and mixed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A further session to record another new song was planned in Spring 2020, but was aborted when the COVID-19 pandemic led to the members becoming physically separated while in Mexico for a festival that became cancelled. Confined to the state of Baja California Sur, members Sebastian Maschat and Erlend √òye used the hotel recording studio that had been intended to be booked for The Whitest Boy Alive to record solo material that was released as the album Quarantine At El Ganzo in July 2020.

The collection eventually included short films experimenting with film technique, low budget features, and documentaries with a particular emphasis on progressive social issues. Founding members were the experimental filmmakers of the 60s and early 70s, including Aggy Read, David Perry, Albie Thoms, Phillip Adams, Phillip Noyce, and later Bruce Petty. The Co-op grew out of the earlier, less formal, group Ubu FilmsMudie, Peter Albie Thoms‚ÄìDavid Perry: Selected filmwork (1964-1992); Dialogues (1994) Uniprint, Perth WA 1994. (Catalogue to Albie Thoms‚ÄìDavid Perry screen exhibition, April 19‚Äì22, 1994) and held its first official meeting in May 1970. One month earlier, the Experimental Film Fund had come into operation, and suddenly filmmakers had the beginnings of government support for independent or non-feature production ‚Äì in fact, independent production became government dependent. With the receipt of its own support from the federally funded Australian Film Commission (AFC), the Co-op opened its own 100-seat cinema in St Peters Lane Darlinghurst in 1973, with the upstairs premises used for film distribution and production of the newspaper Filmnews, begun in February 1975. The paper was initially little more than a supplement to the Co-op's Film Catalogue, but later developed into an independent journal which provided a critical look at issues affecting the production, distribution and exhibition of film and video in Australia. With the beginnings of the Co-op coinciding with the burgeoning of the Women's Liberation movement, and of the Aboriginal Land Rights movement, the Co-op distributed and exhibited some of the first Australian films by, for, and about women, and some of the first films about Aboriginal Australian history and politics. The Sydney Women's Film Group, a collective of members from within the Co-op, was particularly active in distributing women's films for screening at various women's movement events, and Film Co-op women were responsible for programming and producing The International Women's Film Festival of 1975. And as part of the newly reviving Australian film industry, several early Co-op members went on to key roles and careers in mainstream feature film and television production, including Phillip Noyce, Peter Weir and Jan Chapman. In 1981, the Co-op's cinema closed when the AFC decided not to fund it any longer; and the St Peters Lane premises were vacated in February 1985. The AFC supported the Co-op‚Äôs move to new premises in Pyrmont, and encouraged more aggressive marketing and distribution policies, but these policies stretched the Co-op‚Äôs resources. The AFC decided that only one government-funded distribution body was being supported and that was the AFI; the Co-op had to close its doors in February 1986.

It aimed to regularise the status of staple ports in England, Wales, and Ireland. In particular, it designated particular ports where specific goods could be exported or imported. These were called the 'staple ports'. It also established dedicated courts, known as the courts of staple, where disputes relating to commercial matters could be heard, in preference to the courts of common law. There were two immediately prior assemblies in August 1352 and July 1353 at which it is thought the matter of Staples was discussed.G.Unwin, Estate of merchants, p.228-9 The scheme for home town staples was vetted by the more parliamentary assembly in September 1353.Lloyd, English Wool Trade, p.115 Royal officials had already been appointed on 10 July 1353 to run the scheme when the parliament of 1354 confirmed the new scheme by that the Act of Parliament.Ormrod, Edward III, pp. 78‚Äì80 The previous act in 1326 had given the Staple towns legal definition, but the new piece of legislation broadened and widened their trading privileges. The Act facilitated mercantile credit to promote trade (which supported by a sympathetic King Edward, was also the constitutional duty of the Commons). It highlighted the weakness of 14th-century debt system, and the need to regulate trade to improve liquidity, after the economic crisis caused by the Black Death. The staple towns named in the statute were at Newcastle upon Tyne, York, Lincoln, Norwich, Westminster, Canterbury, Chichester, Winchester, Exeter, and Bristol, in England, as well as Dublin, Waterford, Cork, and Drogheda in Ireland. In Wales the designated staple town was Carmarthen. From 1368, the wool staple was transferred away from Canterbury to Queenborough, in Kent. In 1363 the merchants from the staples of York and Bristol founded a new staple at Calais. The merchants had established a near monopoly, and in 1353 were banned from exporting to England. In response in collaboration with the English Crown, the merchants guilds of these two well-established centres decided to organize a new market centre for wool in Bruges. They persistently petitioned parliament to establish \\"the freedom of trade\\" in cloth to Flanders, as a matter of principle. Conveniently the last Bruges monopoly company had been declared bankrupt in 1351. King Edward, whose queen emanated from Hainault, wished for both a diplomatic, commercial and military alliance against France. The Burgesses of the Commons welcomed the King's interest and approved the Staples transfer of trading rights to Bruges. The collapse of available labour supply increased awareness of trade regulation, and the need to control fraud, implied for England imposition of customs duties at given ports. In the interest of \\"the community realm\\" the Chief Justice designated it in the interest of the common law that free trade flourish.

Vasquez means \\"[son] of Vasco\\" and Vasco comes from the pre-Roman latinized name \\"Velascus\\" - a name of uncertain origin and meaning, but probably meaning Basque or Iberian. In Galician-Portuguese the pre-Roman name becomes Velascu > Veascu > Vaasco > Vasco. It is known that in some Spanish-speaking countries, families of non-Iberian ancestry have also adopted this surname. In Colombia and Argentina, there have been instances of \\"Watzke\\" and \\"Watzka\\" families, of German-Czech descent, Hispanicizing their surnames to \\"Vasquez\\".

Glass-ionomer cements are based on the reaction of silicate glass-powder (calciumaluminofluorosilicate glass) and polyacrylic acid, an ionomer. Occasionally water is used instead of an acid, altering the properties of the material and its uses. This reaction produces a powdered cement of glass particles surrounded by matrix of fluoride elements and is known chemically as glass polyalkenoate. There are other forms of similar reactions which can take place, for example, when using an aqueous solution of acrylic/itaconic copolymer with tartaric acid, this results in a glass-ionomer in liquid form. An aqueous solution of maleic acid polymer or maleic/acrylic copolymer with tartaric acid can also be used to form a glass-ionomer in liquid form. Tartaric acid plays a significant part in controlling the setting characteristics of the material. Glass-ionomer based hybrids incorporate another dental material, for example resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) and compomers (or modified composites). Non-destructive neutron scattering has evidenced GIC setting reactions to be non-monotonic, with eventual fracture toughness dictated by changing atomic cohesion, fluctuating interfacial configurations and interfacial terahertz (THz) dynamics.  Background  Glass ionomer cement is primarily used in the prevention of dental caries. This dental material has good adhesive bond properties to tooth structure, allowing it to form a tight seal between the internal structures of the tooth and the surrounding environment. Dental caries is caused by bacterial production of acid during their metabolic actions. The acid produced from this metabolism results in the breakdown of tooth enamel and subsequent inner structures of the tooth, if the disease is not intervened by a dental professional, or if the carious lesion does not arrest and/or the enamel re- mineralises by itself. Glass ionomer cements act as sealants when pits and fissures in the tooth occur and release fluoride to prevent further enamel demineralisation and promote remineralisation. Fluoride can also hinder bacterial growth, by inhibiting their metabolism of ingested sugars in the diet. It does this by inhibiting various metabolic enzymes within the bacteria. This leads to a reduction in the acid produced during the bacteria's digestion of food, preventing a further drop in pH and therefore preventing caries. The application of glass ionomer sealants to occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth, reduce dental caries in comparison to not using sealants at all. There is evidence that when using sealants, only 6% of people develop tooth decay over a 2-year period, in comparison to 40% of people when not using a sealant. However, it is recommended that the use of fluoride varnish alongside glass ionomer sealants should be applied in practice to further reduce the risk of secondary dental caries.  Resin-modified glass ionomers  The addition of resin to glass ionomers improves them significantly, allowing them to be more easily mixed and placed. Resin-modified glass ionomers allow equal or higher fluoride release and there is evidence of higher retention, higher strength and lower solubility. Resin-based glass ionomers have two setting reactions: an acid-base setting and a free-radical polymerisation. The free-radical polymerisation is the predominant mode of setting, as it occurs more rapidly than the acid-base mode. Only the material properly activated by light will be optimally cured. The presence of resin protects the cement from water contamination. Due to the shortened working time, it is recommended that placement and shaping of the material occurs as soon as possible after mixing.  History  Dental sealants were first introduced as part of the preventative programme, in the late 1960s, in response to increasing cases of pits and fissures on occlusal surfaces due to caries. This led to glass ionomer cements to be introduced in 1972 by Wilson and Kent as derivative of the silicate cements and the polycarboxylate cements. The glass ionomer cements incorporated the fluoride releasing properties of the silicate cements with the adhesive qualities of polycarboxylate cements. This incorporation allowed the material to be stronger, less soluble and more translucent (and therefore more aesthetic) than its predecessors. Glass ionomer cements were initially intended to be used for the aesthetic restoration of anterior teeth and were recommended for restoring Class III and Class V cavity preparations. There have now been further developments in the material's composition to improve properties. For example, the addition of metal or resin particles into the sealant is favoured due to the longer working time and the material being less sensitive to moisture during setting. When glass ionomer cements were first used, they were mainly used for the restoration of abrasion/erosion lesions and as a luting agent for crown and bridge reconstructions. However, this has now been extended to occlusal restorations in deciduous dentition, restoration of proximal lesions and cavity bases and liners. This is made possible by the ever-increasing new formulations of glass ionomer cements. One of the early commercially successful GICs, employing G338 glass and developed by Wilson and Kent, served purpose as non-load bearing restorative materials. However, this glass resulted in a cement too brittle for use in load-bearing applications such as in molar teeth. The properties of G338 being shown to be related to its phase-composition, specifically the interplay between its three amorphous phases Ca/Na-Al-Si-O, Ca-Al-F and Ca-P-O-F, as characterised by mechanical testing, dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as quantum chemical modelling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.  Glass ionomer versus resin-based sealants  When the two dental sealants are compared, there has always been a contradiction as to which materials is more effective in caries reduction. Therefore, there are claims against replacing resin-based sealants, the current Gold Standard, with glass ionomer.  Advantages  Glass ionomer sealants are thought to prevent caries through a steady fluoride release over a prolonged period and the fissures are more resistant to demineralization, even after the visible loss of sealant material, however, a systemic review found no difference in caries development when GICs was used as a fissure sealing material compared to the conventional resin based sealants, in addition, it has less retention to the tooth structure than the resin based sealants. These sealants have hydrophilic properties, allowing them to be an alternative of the hydrophobic resin in the generally wet oral cavity. Resin-based sealants are easily destroyed by saliva contamination. Chemically curable glass ionomer cements are considered safe from allergic reactions but a few have been reported with resin-based materials. Nevertheless, allergic reactions are very rarely associated with both sealants.  Disadvantages  The main disadvantage of glass ionomer sealants or cements has been inadequate retention or simply lack of strength, toughness, and limited wear resistance. For instance, due to its poor retention rate, periodic recalls are necessary, even after 6 months, to eventually replace the lost sealant. Different methods have been used to address the physical shortcomings of the glass ionomer cements such as thermo- light curing (polymerization), or addition of the zirconia, hydroxyapatite, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, N-vinyl caprolactam, and fluoroapatite to reinforce the glass ionomer cements.  Clinical applications  Glass ionomers are used frequently due to the versatile properties they contain and the relative ease with which they can be used. Prior to procedures, starter materials for glass ionomers are supplied either as a powder and liquid or as a powder mixed with water. A mixed form of these materials can be provided in an encapsulated form. Preparation of the material should involve following manufacture instructions. A paper pad or cool dry glass slab may be used for mixing the raw materials though it is important to note that the use of the glass slab will retard the reaction and hence increase the working time. The raw materials in liquid and powder form should not be dispensed onto the chosen surface until the mixture is required in the clinical procedure the glass ionomer is being used for, as a prolonged exposure to the atmosphere could interfere with the ratio of chemicals in the liquid. At the stage of mixing, a spatula should be used to rapidly incorporate the powder into the liquid for a duration of 45‚Äì60 seconds depending on manufacture instructions and the individual products. Once mixed together to form a paste, an acid-base reaction occurs which allows the glass ionomer complex to set over a certain period of time and this reaction involves four overlapping stages: * Dissolution * Gelation * Hardening (3‚Äì6 min) * Maturation (24 hr ‚Äì 1 yr) It is important to note that glass ionomers have a long setting time and need protection from the oral environment in order to minimize interference with dissolution and prevent contamination. The type of application for glass ionomers depends on the cement consistency as varying levels of viscosity from very high viscosity to low viscosity, can determine whether the cement is used as luting agents, orthodontic bracket adhesives, pit and fissure sealants, liners and bases, core build-ups, or intermediate restorations. Clinical uses The different clinical uses of glass ionomer compounds as restorative materials include; * Cermets, which are essentially metal reinforced, glass ionomer cements, used to aid in restoring tooth loss as a result of decay or cavities to the tooth surfaces near the gingival margin, or the tooth roots, though cermets can be incorporated at other sites on various teeth, depending on the function required. They maintain adhesion to enamel and dentine and have an identical setting reaction to other glass ionomers. The development of cermets is an attempt to improve the mechanical properties of glass ionomers, particularly brittleness and abrasion resistance by incorporating metals such as silver, tin, gold and titanium. The use of these materials with glass ionomers appears to increase the value of compressive strength and fatigue limit as compared to conventional glass ionomer, however there is no marked difference in the flexural strength and resistance to abrasive wear as compared to glass ionomers. *Dentine surface treatment, which can be performed with glass ionomer cements as the cement has adhesive characteristics which may be useful when placed in undercut cavities. The surfaces on which the glass cement ionomers are placed would be adequately prepared by removing the precipitated salivary proteins, present from saliva as this would greatly reduce the receptiveness of the glass ionomer cement and dentine surface, to bond formation. A number of different substances can be used to remove this element, such as citric acid, however the most effective substance seems to be polyacrylic acid, which is applied to the tooth surface for 30 seconds before it is washed off. The tooth is then dried to ensure the surface is receptive to bond formation but care is taken to ensure desiccation does not occur. * Matrix techniques with glass ionomers, which are used to aid in proximal cavity restorations of anterior teeth. Between the teeth that are adjacent to the cavity, the matrix is inserted, commonly before any dentine surface conditioning. Once the material is inserted in excess, the matrix is placed around the tooth root and kept in place with the help of firm digital pressure while the material sets. Once set, the matrix can be carefully removed using a sharp probe or excavator. * Fissure sealants, which involve the use of glass ionomers as the materials can be mixed to achieve a certain fluid consistency and viscosity that allows the cement to sink into fissures and pits located in posterior teeth and fill these spaces which pose as a site for caries risk, thereby reducing the risk of caries manifesting. * Orthodontic brackets, which can involve the use of glass ionomer cements as an adhesive cement that forms strong chemical bonds between the enamel and the many metals which are used in orthodontic brackets such as stainless steel. * Fluoride varnishes have been combined with sealant application in the prevention of dental caries. It has been proven that the combined usage of both increases the overall effectiveness as compared to using fluoride varnish alone. Chemistry and setting reaction All GICs contain a basic glass and an acidic polymer liquid, which set by an acid-base reaction. The polymer is an ionomer, containing a small proportion ‚Äì some 5 to 10% ‚Äì of substituted ionic groups. These allow it to be acid decomposable and clinically set readily. The glass filler is generally a calcium alumino fluorosilicate powder, which upon reaction with a polyalkenoic acid gives a glass polyalkenoate-glass residue set in an ionised, polycarboxylate matrix. The acid base setting reaction begins with the mixing of the components. The first phase of the reaction involves dissolution. The acid begins to attach the surface of the glass particles, as well as the adjacent tooth substrate, thus precipitating their outer layers but also neutralising itself. As the pH of the aqueous solution rises, the polyacrylic acid begins to ionise, and becoming negatively charged it sets up a diffusion gradient and helps draw cations out of the glass and dentine. The alkalinity also induces the polymers to dissociate, increasing the viscosity of the aqueous solution. The second phase is gelation, where as the pH continues to rise and the concentration of the ions in solution to increase, a critical point is reached and insoluble polyacrylates begin to precipitate. These polyanions have carboxylate groups whereby cations bind them, especially Ca2+ in this early phase, as it is the most readily available ion, crosslinking into calcium polyacrylate chains that begin to form a gel matrix, resulting in the initial hard set, within five minutes. Crosslinking, H bonds and physical entanglement of the chains are responsible for gelation. During this phase, the GIC is still vulnerable and must be protected from moisture. If contamination occurs, the chains will degrade and the GIC lose its strength and optical properties. Conversely, dehydration early on will crack the cement and make the surface porous. Over the next twenty four hours maturation occurs. The less stable calcium polyacrylate chains are progressively replaced by aluminium polyacrylate, allowing the calcium to join the fluoride and phosphate and diffuse into the tooth substrate, forming polysalts, which progressively hydrate to yield a physically stronger matrix.Gao W.; Smales R.J.; Yip H;K. 2000. Demineralization and remineralization of dentine caries, and the role of glass-ionomer cements. Int Dent J. Feb;50(1):51-6. The incorporation of fluoride delays the reaction, increasing the working time. Other factors are the temperature of the cement, and the powder to liquid ratio ‚Äì more powder or heat speeding up the reaction. GICs have good adhesive relations with tooth substrates, uniquely chemically bonding to dentine and, to a lesser extend, to enamel. During initial dissolution, both the glass particles and the hydroxyapatite structure are affected, and thus as the acid is buffered the matrix reforms, chemically welded together at the interface into a calcium phosphate polyalkenoate bond. In addition, the polymer chains are incorporated into both, weaving cross links, and in dentine the collagen fibres also contribute, both linking physically and H-bonding to the GIC salt precipitates. There is also microretention from porosities occurring in the hydroxyapatite.Yilmaz, Y. et al. 2005. The influence of various conditioning agents on the interdiffusion zone and microleakage of a glass ionomer cement with a high viscosity in primary teeth. Journal of Operative Dentistry, 30:1 105-113. Works employing non-destructive neutron scattering and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy have evidenced that GIC's developing fracture toughness during setting is related to interfacial THz dynamics, changing atomic cohesion and fluctuating interfacial configurations. Setting of GICs is non-monotonic, characterised by abrupt features, including a glass‚Äìpolymer coupling point, an early setting point, where decreasing toughness unexpectedly recovers, followed by stress- induced weakening of interfaces. Subsequently, toughness declines asymptotically to long-term fracture test values.  Glass Ionomer Cement as a Permanent Material?   Fluoride Release and Remineralisation  The pattern of fluoride release from glass ionomer cement is characterised by an initial rapid release of appreciable amounts of fluoride, followed by a taper in the release rate over time. An initial fluoride ‚Äúburst‚Äù effect is desirable to reduce the viability of remaining bacteria in the inner carious dentin, hence, inducing enamel or dentin remineralization. The constant fluoride release during the following days are attributed to the fluoride ability to diffuse through cement pores and fractures. Thus, continuous small amounts of fluoride surrounding the teeth reduces demineralization of the tooth tissues. A study by Chau et al. shows a negative correlation between acidogenicity of the biofilm and the fluoride release by GIC, suggestive that enough fluoride release may decrease the virulence of cariogenic biofilms. In addition, Ngo et al. (2006) studied the interaction between demineralised dentine and Fuji IX GP which includes a strontium ‚Äì containing glass as opposed to the more conventional calcium-based glass in other GICs. A substantial amount of both strontium and fluoride ions was found to cross the interface into the partially demineralised dentine affected by caries. This promoted mineral depositions in these areas where calcium ion levels were low. Hence, this study supports the idea of glass ionomers contributing directly to remineralisation of carious dentine, provided that good seal is achieved with intimate contact between the GIC and partly demineralised dentine. This, then raises a question, ‚ÄúIs glass ionomer cement a suitable material for permanent restorations?‚Äù due to the desirable effects of fluoride release by glass ionomer cement.  Glass Ionomer Cement in Primary Teeth  Numerous studies and reviews have been published with respect to GIC used in primary teeth restorations. Findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that conventional glass ionomers were not recommended for Class II restorations in primary molars. This material showed poor anatomical form and marginal integrity, and composite restorations were shown to be more successful than GIC when good moisture control could be achieved. Resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) were developed to overcome the limitations of the conventional glass ionomer as a restorative material. A systematic review supports the use of RMGIC in small to moderate sized class II cavities, as they are able to withstand the occlusal forces on primary molars for at least one year. With their desirable fluoride releasing effect, RMGIC may be considered for Class I and Class II restorations of primary molars in high caries risk population.  Glass Ionomer Cement in Permanent Teeth  With regard to permanent teeth, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of RMGIC as long term restorations in permanent teeth. Despite the low number of randomised control trials, a meta- analysis review by Bezerra et al. [2009] reported significantly fewer carious lesions on the margins of glass ionomer restorations in permanent teeth after six years as compared to amalgam restorations. In addition, adhesive ability and longevity of GIC from a clinical standpoint can be best studied with restoration of non- carious cervical lesions. A systematic review shows GIC has higher retention rates than resin composite in follow up periods of up to 5 years. Unfortunately, reviews for Class II restorations in permanent teeth with glass ionomer cement are scarce with high bias or short study periods. However, a study [2003] of the compressive strength and the fluoride release was done on 15 commercial fluoride- releasing restorative materials. A negative linear correlation was found between the compressive strength and fluoride release (r2=0.7741), i.e., restorative materials with high fluoride release have lower mechanical properties.  Conclusion  With the increasing acceptance and use of GIC, more studies and research need to be conducted to improve the current limitations due to the inferior physical properties of GIC compared to other materials. Future improvements will be necessary to increase their longevity to be used as permanent materials. However, for now, due to the inconclusive, low-grade evidence claiming the superiority of GIC in restorations, this page does not support the use of GIC in permanent restorations.

It has been instrumental in the development of the Jersey cow and its success throughout the world, and today is responsible for management of the breed in its Island home. The Royal Jersey Showground, the Society's headquarters, also holds a wide range of indoor and outdoor events and provides meeting, conference and exhibition facilities.  History of the Society  On the 26 August 1833 a meeting was held in St. Helier, chaired by the Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey, Major General Thornton, to consider forming an agricultural society. At this meeting it was unanimously agreed \\"...to be highly desirable to form in this Island an Agricultural and Horticultural Society\\". From its early years the Society organised cattle shows and competitions among growers and breeders, as shown in this advertisement of 1845 An earlier attempt to form an agricultural society in Jersey in 1790 had failed, but this time it was successful and the first meeting of the new society was held on the 7 September 1833. The aims of the new society were \\"to create a spirit of industry and emulation, to offer premiums for the improvement of agriculture, breeding of cattle, improved domestic economy, cleanliness and comfort in cottages, and also for the encouragement of industry and good behavior among servants and labourers in the employment of members or subscribers of the Society\\". This was at a time during the 19th century, following the agricultural revolution in the United Kingdom, when many such societies were founded to communicate the latest improvements in agricultural practices to the farming community. Today the RJA&HS; is made up of two departments: * The Agricultural Department stages agricultural shows, provides a range of services to support the modern dairy industry and is primarily responsible for the management of the Jersey breed in the Island. *The Horticultural Department is primarily concerned with the promotion of horticulture through talks, shows, garden competitions and general advice.  The RJA&HS; Headquarters  The Royal Jersey Agricultural & Horticultural Society is the oldest society in the Island and during its life has occupied a number of premises in the Island's capital, Saint Helier. In 1834 the Society rented an office at 19 Halkett Place, moving to 19 Bath Street in 1865. A permanent showground was established on meadow land, purchased in 1884, at the edge of St. Helier and was developed into the Springfield showground. Prior to this, shows were held at the Island's Cattle Market. In 1899 the Society's offices moved to 8 Church Street and in 1913 3 Mulcaster Street was purchased. In 1969 the Society's offices moved to a new building built at the Springfield showground. The showground itself had been enlarged and developed considerably since its original purchase, e.g. the construction of the Springfield Pavilion in 1922. The Springfield estate was sold to the States of Jersey in December 1995. Musical performance in 2008 at the showground in Trinity The Society relocated its operations to new office and showground facilities in September 2000. Located in the Parish of Trinity in the heart of the Island, these new Headquarters and showground were officially opened on 13 July 2001, by the Society's Patron, Her Majesty The Queen.  Royal Patronage of the RJA&HS;  When His Majesty King William IV conferred his Royal Patronage upon the Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society in 1834, he set a precedent that has been graciously continued by each successive Monarch since then. In 1837 Her Majesty Queen Victoria ascended the Throne, and shortly after granted her Royal Patronage upon the Society. In June 1887 the Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Victoria was celebrated with a combined show of the Society, at which the judging of cattle took place in public for the first time. In January 1901, His Majesty King Edward VII granted his Royal Patronage to the Society. The next patron, His Majesty King George V, visited Jersey in 1921, when he was presented with a splendid specimen of the breed 'La Sente's Miss Bronzemine' at the Society's Springfield showground. In 1936 His Majesty King George VI ascended the Throne and following in the footsteps of his predecessors and brother His Majesty King Edward VIII, granted Royal Patronage upon the Society. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II ascended the Throne in 1952 and graciously granted Royal Patronage upon the Society. During visits to the Island Her Majesty has also been presented with prize 'Jersey' cows to join the Royal herd at Windsor.  Agriculture in Jersey  The agricultural industry in Jersey has seen many changes over the centuries, which in turn have influenced the rural landscape of the Island and demonstrated the resourcefulness and adaptability of the Jersey farmer. During the 17th century the wool and knitting industry dominated the rural economy. So much attention was paid to the production of woollen garments that legislation was introduced by the States to control the time devoted to knitting as the gathering of vraic (seaweed used for fertiliser) and harvesting were being neglected. The 18th century saw the development of an apple growing and cider production industry. By the beginning of the 19th century some 13,500 verg√©es, or one quarter of the land area, were planted to apple trees with much of the cider production destined for export. The cattle breeding and export industry expanded rapidly during the 19th century and lasted well into the 20th century. At a similar time the growing and export of early potatoes replaced apples as the major crop and by the beginning of the 20th century some 20,000 verg√©es were devoted to early potato production. At this time the Island also became renowned for the production of tomatoes and flowers. Today, however, the dominant crop grown in the Island is the Jersey Royal potato. The story of the development of the 'Jersey Royal', a variety unique to the Island, is one in which the RJA&HS; played an important part in the early development of the variety. The Jersey cow  The Jersey cow in the Island  Jersey cows being judged in Jersey The Jersey breed of dairy cow originates from the Island of Jersey and it is quite distinct from all other breeds of livestock. Renowned for its beauty, ease of management and natural ability to produce rich creamy milk, the 'Jersey' is a product of the Island, its soil, its climate, its people and their history. The early influences on the breed are shrouded in obscurity, as with most domestic breeds, although legislation introduced by the States of Jersey in 1763 preventing the importation of cattle, to protect the local market for agricultural products, ensured the evolution of the 'Jersey' breed. Local farmers concentrated on developing their cattle from the limited local population and their skill 'fixed' the special characteristics of the 'Jersey' resulting in the cattle we see today. The Island breed is recognised internationally as a unique population of livestock. The 'Jersey' is predominantly fawn in colour, although they can range from almost pure mulberry (black) to broken coloured, including patches of white. The most distinctive features of the 'Jersey' are its black nose with a mealy white band round it, the traditional dished face, refined bone and graceful beauty.  The Cattle Export Industry  The exportation of cattle from the Island commenced in the 18th century and during the 19th and 20th centuries became a very important industry in the Island as a result of the growing worldwide demand for Jersey cattle. There is evidence of 'Jerseys' being exported to England during the 17th century and records show Jersey cattle being exported to America by 1850, Australia by 1854, New Zealand by 1862, Canada by 1868, South Africa by 1877, Sweden by 1893 and Denmark by 1896. In 1882 the cow 'Khedive's Primrose' was sold to America for the incredible sum of ¬£1,000, which in those days would have been sufficient to purchase an average size farm, house and buildings. The importance of the cattle export industry to the Island can be illustrated when, in the three years from 1830, some 5,756 head of livestock were exported. Over a hundred years later, in 1948, as trade resumed following the end of World War II, some 2,041 animals were exported from the Island which, at that time, had a population of 8,973 head of cattle with 2,404 heifer calves being registered in that year. As importing countries have developed their own national herds to suit their particular conditions the export of cattle has declined in recent years, however, top bloodlines from the Island herd are still exported mainly in the form of frozen bull semen.  The Jersey Cow Around the World  The qualities of the 'Jersey' breed have been much prized by dairy farmers all over the world and the 'Jersey' can now be found grazing fields in over 100 countries. The adaptability of the 'Jersey' to a variety of different environments ensures that the breed will thrive in climates where other dairy breeds struggle. Major populations of 'Jersey' cattle can be found in the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Denmark and Latin America. With an estimated worldwide population in excess of 2 million head, the 'Jersey' is now the second most numerous breed of dairy cow and an important influence in the global dairy industry. Most countries with a significant number of 'Jersey' cattle have founded a breed association to manage and promote the breed in their respective countries. In 1949 the leading countries held a conference in this Island and in 1951 formed the World Jersey Cattle Bureau as an umbrella organisation for the breed around the world. The World Jersey Cattle Bureau has its office in the RJA&HS; headquarters building.  The Jersey Herd Book  The Jersey Herd Book is a register in which is recorded information relating to the bovine population, including the owner, a description of the animal, its ancestry, date of birth and many other facts. The Jersey Herd Book was formed on the 4 April 1866 and the ancestry of all pedigree 'Jerseys' in the world can be traced back to the Herd Book maintained on the Island. The first animal registered in the Herd Book was a bull named 'Dandy', owned by Mr James Godfray of St. Martin, and the first cow registered was named 'Daisy', belonging to Mr. P. Paisnel of St. Clement. In addition to holding pedigree details the Herd Book also records an animal's production and conformation, which is very important for assessing the breeding value of individuals so that the farmers can improve their stock, and therefore, the general condition of the cattle population. Every animal is appraised visually and scored against a scale of points to describe its physical conformation, known as 'Herd Book Exams'. Initially production performance was measured by milk testing at shows during the 1860s, with 24-hour butter tests starting in 1893. These were replaced in 1912 by a system of recording the weight of milk yielded by the individual cattle, which was the forerunner of the system of milk recording carried out to this day.

The JRTCA is affiliated with the Jack Russell Terrier United World Federation (JRTUWF), an organization of Jack Russell clubs dedicated to protecting the working Jack Russell Terrier worldwide. The JRTCA is not affiliated with the American Kennel Club (AKC). JRTCA membership includes members from the U.S. and other countries including Canada, England, Scotland, Australia, South Africa, Sweden, Japan, and the Bahamas. The JRTCA Annual National Trial attracts approximately 1,200 Jack Russells from all over the U.S. and Canada, and is the largest exclusively Jack Russell Terrier gathering in the world.  History, Philosophy and Structure  The JRTCA was founded in 1976 by Mrs. Ailsa Crawford, one of the first Jack Russell Terrier breeders in the United States. Ms. Crawford and the early founders of the Jack Russell Terrier Club put a lot of thought into structuring the JRTCA so that work remained front and center. Towards that end, the club decided that its highest award ‚Äî the ‚ÄúBronze Medallion‚Äù ‚Äî would not go to show dogs, but to working dogs that had demonstrated their ability in the field by working at least three of six types of American quarry ‚Äî red fox, gray fox, raccoon, groundhog, opossum, or badger in front of a JRTCA-certified field judge. In the show ring the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America decided to ban professional handlers as it was thought this would make the shows less serious (and more fun) while keeping the focus on the essential element of work. Instead of mandating the kind of narrow conformation ranges demanded by the American Kennel Club for their terrier breeds, the JRTCA decided to divide the diverse world of the Jack Russell Terrier into three coat types (smooth, broken and rough), and two sizes (10 inches tall to 12.5 inches tall, and 12.5 inches tall to 15 inches tall).‚ÄúDifferent horses for different courses‚Äù became the watchword, with overt recognition that different quarry, different earths, and different climates required different dogs. Unlike the Kennel Club, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America also decided to maintain an ‚Äúopen‚Äù registry so that new blood might be infused at times. At the same time, the JRTCA discouraged inbreeding and eventually restricted line breeding to a set percentage. To balance off an open-registry with the desire to keep Jack Russell-type dogs looking like Jack Russells, the JRTCA decided not to allow dogs to be registered at birth or to register entire litters. Instead, each adult dog would be photographed from both sides and the front, with each dog admitted to the registry on its own merit. In addition, each dog had to be measured for height and chest span. This last element turned out to be quite important, as it meant that the height and chest measurements of adult dogs were recorded as they were registered. Over time, both height and chest size of adult dogs could be tracked through pedigrees ‚Äî an essential element of breeding correctly sized working terriers. The JRTCA was not shy about their rationale for these rules: they openly and emphatically opposed Kennel Club registration, maintaining that time had shown that dogs brought into the Kennel Club quickly grew too big and often lost other essential working attributes such as nose, voice, and prey drive. Today the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America is the largest Jack Russell Terrier club and registry in the world, and its Annual National Trial attracts approximately 1,200 Jack Russell terriers from all over the U.S. and Canada. The JRTCA‚Äôs small professional staff cranks out a bimonthly magazine (entitled \\"True Grit\\") that is 80-100 pages long, holds a regular schedule of dog shows, and sells Deben locator collars and fox nets for the working terrier enthusiast. Perhaps the most important service work of the JRTCA has been the ads the Club routinely runs in all-breed publications warning people that Jack Russell Terriers are not a dog for everyone, are primarily a hunting dog, and are not like the cute dogs seen on TV and in the movies. The JRTCA's \\"Bad Dog Talk\\" section is particularly recommended for anyone thinking about getting a Jack Russell Terrier. A JRTCA Directory of Breeders is published annually, which includes breeders throughout the country as well as educational information geared towards those purchasing a JR. A JRTCA Stud Book is published semi-annually to assist JR owners in planning breedings.

In 1975, he began a new venture as a composer for films. His first film score, for director Gilles Carle's La T√™te de Normande St. Onge (1975), won a Canadian Film Award. In 1977, he worked on the Gilles Carle film L'Ange et la femme along with his future wife, the actress and singer Carole Laure. This project involved more than composing alone; Furey and Laure are famously seen performing a sex act in the film. Furey also composed for the Allan Moyle film The Rubber Gun, which despite the risqu√©-sounding title was about families affected by drug use. Later in the 1970s, Furey and Laure produced a number of successful stage reviews in Paris. Furey also served as producer and frequently also as songwriter for a series of albums by Carole Laure, beginning with Alibis (1979, RCA KKL-1-0290), a hit in Qu√©bec in 1979. In 1980, Furey wrote the music for another Gilles Carle film Fantastica, which starred Laure in the lead role of Lorca. Furey also acted in the film and was nominated for a Genie Award in Canada for \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.\\" Furey further developed his career in film and television music with productions such as a 1983 Gilles Carle movie, Maria Chapdelaine, based on the classic Qu√©bec-based Louis H√©mon novel of the same name. His score for this film won a Genie Award. In 1984 he wrote the screenplay for Night Magic, with the script co-written by Leonard Cohen. Based in France since the late 1970s, Furey has continued to score film and television work as well as producing and writing for successful albums by Laure, such as She Says Move On (1991) and Sentiments naturels (1997). A stage production based on the latter ran for over a month in Paris in 1998. Furey's songs have been recorded by various other artists such as C√©line Dion, who recorded \\"Michael's Song\\" (La ballade de Michel) and \\"Listen to the Magic Man\\" (\\"Dans La Main D'un Magicien\\") for the film The Peanut Butter Solution (1985), both co-written by Eddy Marnay [detailed biography in French Wikipedia]; Tom Robinson, who recorded \\"Closing a Door\\" (Cabaret '79, 1982) and \\"Love Comes\\" (North by Northwest, 1982); and Petula Clark. His first two albums became hits in Japan and are available on CD only as Japanese re-releases. He is abundantly represented on the Japanese-language internet (search on „É´„Ç§„ÇπÔΩ•„Éï„É•„Éº„É¨„Ç§). A CD version of The Sky is Falling was released in France. He is the brother of Canadian playwright/actor/pianist Richard Greenblatt, author of the major hit play 2 Pianos, 4 Hands.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, AOC-in-C (Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief) Bomber Command, believed that \\"We can wreck Berlin from end to end if the USAAF come in with us. It will cost us between 400 and 500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war\\". Harris could expect about 800 serviceable heavy bombers for each raid, equipped with new and sophisticated navigational devices such as H2S radar. The USAAF, having recently lost many aircraft in attacks on Schweinfurt, did not participate. The Main Force of Bomber Command attacked Berlin sixteen times but failed in its object of inflicting a decisive defeat on Germany. The Royal Air Force lost more than 7,000 aircrew and 1,047 bombers, 5.1 per cent of the sorties flown; 1,682 aircraft were damaged or written off. On 30 March 1944, Bomber Command attacked Nuremberg with 795 aircraft, 94 of which were shot down and 71 were damaged. The Luftwaffe's I. Jagdkorps recorded the loss of 256 night fighters from November 1943 to March 1944. The retaliated with (Operation Capricorn) against London and other British cities from January to May 1944. The managed to accumulate 524 bombers but caused little damage for the loss of 329 aircraft, a greater percentage loss per raid and overall than that suffered by Bomber Command over Germany. There were many other air raids on Berlin by the RAF, the USAAF Eighth Air Force and Soviet bombers. The RAF was granted a battle honour for the bombardment of Berlin by aircraft of Bomber Command from 1940 to 1945. Battle The first Bomber Command raid of the battle occurred on the night of 18/19 November 1943. Berlin was attacked by 440 Avro Lancaster heavy bombers of the Main Force and four de Havilland Mosquitos but the city was under cloud and the damage was not severe. The second raid by the Main Force took place on the night of 22/23 November. This was the most effective raid on Berlin by the RAF of the war, causing extensive damage to the residential areas west of the centre, Tiergarten and Charlottenburg, Sch√∂neberg and Spandau. Because of dry weather, several firestorms ignited. The Protestant Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, now a war memorial and the New Synagogue (used as a store house by the Wehrmacht) were badly damaged in the raid. In the next nights, further attacks followed, damaging or destroying Bethlehem's Church, John's Church, Lietzow Church, Trinity Church, Emperor Frederick Memorial Church, Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz and St. Hedwig's Cathedral. Several other buildings of note were either destroyed or damaged, including the British, French, Italian and Japanese embassies, Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin Zoo, the Ministry of Munitions, the Waffen SS Administrative College, the barracks of the Imperial Guard at Spandau and several arms factories. On 17 December, extensive damage was done to the Berlin railway system. By this time the cumulative effect of the bombing campaign had made more than a quarter of Berlin's living accommodation unusable. There was another Main Force raid on the night of 28/29 January 1944, when the western and southern districts were hit in the most concentrated attack of this period. On 15/16 February, important war industries were hit, including the large Siemensstadt area in the west, with the centre and south-western districts receiving most of the damage. This was the largest raid by the RAF on Berlin; the campaign continued until March 1944. Aftermath Analysis The ruins of St. Hedwig's Cathedral, 1946 In 1961, the British official historians, Charles Webster and Noble Frankland wrote that Bomber Command sent with on Berlin. The attacks cost their crews killed or captured and damaged, a rate of loss of 5.8 per cent, exceeding the 5 per cent threshold that was considered by the RAF to be the maximum sustainable operational loss rate. The Battle of Berlin diverted German military resources from the land war and had an economic effect in physical damage, worker fatalities and injuries, relocation and fortification of industrial buildings and other infrastructure but by 1 April 1944, the campaign had failed to force a German capitulation, In 2004, Daniel Oakman wrote that, Harris had predicted the loss of and Oakman wrote \\"...it would be wrong to say that it was, in a strategic sense, a wasted effort. Bombing brought the war to Germany at a time when it was difficult to apply pressure anywhere else\\". In 2005, Kevin Wilson wrote that, despite the devastation of Berlin, the British raids failed to achieve their objectives. The bombing prevented increases in German production and caused resources to be diverted from offensive to defensive purposes but German civilian morale did not break. The Berlin defences and essential services were maintained and war production in greater Berlin did not fall. In 2006, Adam Tooze, an economic historian, wrote that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 appeared to vindicate the hopes of the British leaders in Bomber Command, that it had become a decisive weapon and that the theory of strategic bombing had been vindicated. Bomber Command was only able to emulate the Hamburg firestorm of 28 July once, at Kassel in October. In the winter of 1943, the attacks on Berlin began, which Tooze called fruitless, Berlin was a big manufacturing city but the Ruhr was the principal supplier of coal and steel to Germany. Isolating the Ruhr could strangle the rest of the German war economy; in the campaign against Berlin, the British caused much damage but the evolution of German anti- aircraft defences, particularly night fighters, was able to counter the Bomber Command threat on its long flights to Berlin in winter weather. German casualties The Battle of Berlin caused immense loss of life and devastation in Berlin. The 22 November 1943 raid killed 2,000 Berliners and rendered 175,000 homeless. The following night, 1,000 people were killed and 100,000 bombed out. During December and January, Main Force raids killed hundreds of people and rendered between 20,000 and 80,000 homeless each night. In 1982, Laurenz Demps collated loss data using the damage reports of the Berlin police commissioner (Polizeipr√§sident) issued after each air raid, descriptions of losses and damage indicated by houses and distributed to 100‚Äì150 organisations and administrations busy with rescue, repair, planning and other matters, against reports of the main bureau for air raid protection (Hauptluftschutzstelle) of the city of Berlin, which issued more than 100 copies with variable frequency, each summarising losses and damage by the number of air raids; the war diary of the air raid warning command (Luftwarnkommando ‚Äì Wako Berlin), a branch of the Luftwaffe and other sources. Demps wrote that 7,480 people had been killed, 2,194 people were reported missing, 17,092 were injured and 817,730 Berliners made homeless. In 2003, Reinhard R√ºrup wrote that nearly 4,000 people were killed, 10,000 injured and 450,000 made homeless. In 2005, Kevin Wilson described the effect of smoke and dust in the air from the bombing and long periods spent in shelters gave rise to symptoms that were called cellar influenza (Kellergrippe). Chronology * Night of 18/19 November 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 440 Avro Lancasters and four de Havilland Mosquitos, of which 402 bombed the city, which was under cloud. Diversions on Mannheim and Ludwigshafen were flown by 395 other aircraft. Mosquitos attacked several other towns. In all 884 sorties, 32 aircraft (3.6 per cent) were lost, of which nine were lost in the Berlin raid. The air raid warning was sounded at 20:11 and the all clear at 22:23. 143 were killed in the raid, with an additional four missing, 409 wounded and 7,326 who were made homeless; 533 houses were destroyed, 8,493 were damaged. * Night of 19/20 November 1943: Leverkusen was the main target for 266 aircraft: 170 Halifaxes, 86 Stirlings, 10 Mosquitoes; other towns were bombed. 5 aircraft were lost.Middlebrook 1996, p.452 * Night of 22/23 November 1943: Berlin the main target. 469 Lancasters, 234 Handley Page Halifaxes, 50 Short Stirlings, 11 Mosquitos. A total of 764 aircraft. 26 aircraft lost - 3.4 per cent of the force. This was the most effective raid on Berlin of the war. Most of the damage was to the residential areas west of the city centre, Tiergarten and Charlottenburg, Sch√∂neberg and Spandau. Because of the dry weather conditions, several 'firestorms' were caused. 175,000 people were made homeless and the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (Kaiser-Wilhelm- Ged√§chtniskirche) was destroyed. Several other buildings of note were either damaged or destroyed, including the British, French, Italian and Japanese embassies, Charlottenburg Castle and Berlin Zoo. Also the Ministry of Weapons and Munitions, the Waffen-SS Administrative College, the barracks of the Imperial Guard at Spandau, as well as several factories employed in the manufacture of material for the armed forces. * Night of 23/24 November 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 365 Lancasters, 10 Halifaxes, eight Mosquitos (383 aircraft). * Night of 24/25 November 1943: Berlin was attacked by six Mosquitos (one lost); nine Vickers Wellingtons dropping leaflets over France. * Night of 25/26 November 1943: Frankfurt was the main target for 236 Halifaxes and 26 Lancasters (262 aircraft). Three Mosquitos were sent to Berlin and other targets were bombed.Middlebrook 1996, p.454 * Night of 26/27 November 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 443 Lancasters and seven Mosquitos. The Mosquitos were used to lay Window ahead of the Pathfinder aircraft to draw flak away from them but due to a temporarily clear sky, 21 aircraft were lost to AA guns over Berlin. Most of the damage was in the semi- industrial suburb of Reinickendorf but the city centre and the Siemensstadt (with its many electrical equipment factories), was also hit. Stuttgart was raided by 157 Halifaxes and 21 Lancasters as a diversion. Both forces flew the same route almost as far as Frankfurt which fighter controllers identified as the RAF target. The total sorties for the night, including minelaying operations, was 666 with 34 aircraft (5.1 per cent) lost. Losses over Berlin was high and combined with landing accidents in fog in England, reached 9.3 per cent. The Alkett factory, a big producer of armoured fighting vehicles, was badly hit and Goebbels described it as \\"almost completely destroyed\\" and referred to \\"virtually irreplaceable tools and machines\\" being out of action in his diary. * Night of 28/29 November 1943: Essen was attacked by 10 Mosquitos. * Night of 29/30 November 1943: Bochum, Cologne and D√ºsseldorf, attacked by 21 Mosquitos. * Night of 30/1 December 1943: Essen attacked by four Mosquitos. * Night of 2/3 December 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 425 Lancasters, 18 Mosquitos and 15 Halifaxes. The Germans identified Berlin as the target. Unexpected cross winds scattered the bomber stream and German fighters shot down forty bombers, 37 Lancasters, two Halifaxes and a Mosquito (8.7 per cent of the force). The bombing was inaccurate and to the south of the city but two more of the Siemens factories, a ball-bearing factory and several railway installations were damaged. * Night of 3/4 December 1943: Leipzig, the main target, was attacked by 307 Lancasters, 220 Halifaxes (527 aircraft). The main force took a direct heading to Berlin, then turned south for Leipzig, leaving 9 Mosquitos to carry on, decoying many German night fighters. * Night of 4/5 December 1943: Duisburg attacked by nine Mosquitos. * Night of 10/11 December 1943: Leverkusen attacked by 25 Mosquitos. * Night of 11/12 December 1943: Duisburg attacked by 18 Mosquitos. * Night of 12/13 December 1943: Essen attacked by 18 Mosquitos and D√ºsseldorf by nine more. * Night of 13/14 December 1943: 16 Mosquitos went to D√ºsseldorf. * Night of 16/17 December 1943: Berlin was the main target. It was attacked by 483 Lancasters and 15 Mosquitos. German night fighters were directed to intercept the bombers; 25 Lancasters, 5.2 per cent of the Lancaster force, were lost over enemy occupied territory and 29 aircraft were lost on landing in England due to very low cloud. The raid was unusual in that losses due to bad weather over England were greater than losses due to flak or enemy night fighters. The damage to the Berlin railway system was extensive and 1,000 wagon-loads of war material destined for the Eastern Front were held up for six days. The National Theatre and the building housing Germany's military and political archives were both destroyed. The effect of the bombing campaign had made unusable more than a quarter of the living accommodation in Berlin. Two Beaufighters and two Mosquitos of No. 141 Squadron RAF using Serrate radar detectors managed to damage a Messerschmitt Bf 110, the first successful 'Serrate' patrol. On the same night there was other raids on Tilley-le-Haut and Flixecourt, two flying-bomb sites near Abbeville. The raid failed to destroy the sites but no aircraft were lost. * Night of 19/20 December 1943: leafleting over French towns without loss. * Night of 20/21 December 1943: Frankfurt was attacked by 390 Lancasters, 257 Halifaxes and three Mosquitos (650 aircraft). German night fighters got into the bomber stream; 27 Halifaxes and 14 Lancasters were lost, 6.3 per cent of the force. Damage was more than the RAF thought at the time because they knew that the Germans had lit decoy fires, which had some success as diversions. There was a decoy raid on Mannheim by 54 aircraft and a precision attack by eight Lancasters of 617 Squadron and 8 Pathfinder Mosquitos, on an armaments factory near Liege that failed to hit the target. * Night of 21/22 December 1943: Mannesmann factory at D√ºsseldorf attacked by nine Mosquitos and a number of other small raids. * Night of 22/23 December 1943: 51 aircraft attacked two flying-bomb sites between Abbeville and Amiens. One site was destroyed but the other was not located. There were two small Mosquito raids on Frankfurt and Bonn. * Night of 23/24 December 1943: Berlin was attacked by 364 Lancasters, eight Mosquitos and seven Halifaxes. German nightfighters were hampered by the weather and shot down only 16 Lancasters, 4.2 per cent of the force. Little damage was caused to Berlin; several other German towns were attacked by Mosquitos. * Night of 24/25 December 1943: minelaying * Night of 29/30 December 1943: Berlin was the target for 457 Lancasters, 252 Halifaxes and three Mosquitos (712 aircraft), RAF losses were light at 2.8 per cent of the force. Cloud cover frustrated the RAF and little damage was caused. * Night of 30/31 December 1943: 10 Lancasters of 617 Squadron and six Pathfinder Mosquitos failed to destroy a V1 site. * Night of 31 December 1943/1 January 1944: minelaying * Night of 1/2 January 1944: 421 Lancasters dispatched to Berlin, the main target. German night fighters shot down 6.7 per cent of the force. A small raid on Hamburg by 15 Mosquitos and smaller raids on other towns failed to divert the night fighters. * Night of 2/3 January 1944: Berlin was the main target. 362 Lancasters, 12 Mosquitos, nine Halifaxes (383 aircraft), night fighters failed to reach the bombers until they were over the city, then shoot down 27 Lancasters, 10 per cent of the force. There were also minor raids on other cities. * Night of 3/4 January 1944: Solingen and Essen attacked by eight Mosquitos; no losses. * Night of 4/5 January 1944: Two flying bomb sites attacked by 80 aircraft. Berlin raided by 13 Mosquitos; small raids on other targets. Flights for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) were flown, delivering supplies and agents to resistance forces. * Night of 5/6 January 1944: Stettin was the main target for the first time since September 1941, for 348 Lancasters and 10 Halifaxes. A diversionary raid by 13 Mosquitos on Berlin and 25 to four other targets spoofed the night fighters and RAF losses were only 16 aircraft, 4.5 per cent of the force. * Night of 6/7 January 1944: Small raids on Duisburg, Bristillerie, Dortmund and Solingen by 19 Mosquitos. * Night of 7/8 January 1944: Small raids on Krefeld and Duisburg by 11 Mosquitos. Ten men were killed when a SOE support flight crashed shortly after take-off. * Night of 8/9 January 1944: Small raids on Frankfurt, Solingen, Aachen and Dortmund by 23 Mosquitos. Two aircraft lost. * Night of 10/11 January 1944: Small raids on Berlin, Solingen, Koblenz and Krefeld by 20 Mosquitos; no losses. * Night of 13/14 January 1944: Small raids on Essen, Duisburg, Aachen, and Koblenz by 25 Mosquitos. One aircraft was lost. * Night of 14/15 January 1944: Raid on Brunswick, the first of the war, by 496 Lancasters and two Halifaxes. 38 Lancasters were lost to night fighters. 11 of the lost aircraft were Pathfinders and the marking of the city was poor. German authorities reported only 10 houses destroyed and 14 people killed in Brunswick with some damage and loss of life in villages to the south. 82 aircraft attacked flying bomb sites at Ailly, Bonneton and Bristillerie without loss; 17 Mosquitos raided Magdeburg and Berlin. * Night of 20/21 January 1944: Berlin was the target; 495 Lancasters, 264 Halifaxes, 10 Mosquitos (769 aircraft) were dispatched; 22 Halifaxes and 13 Lancasters were lost, 4.6 per cent of the force. The damage could not be assessed due to low cloud the next day. * Night of 21/22 January 1944: Magdeburg was the main target for 421 Lancasters, 224 Halifaxes, 3 Mosquitoes (648 aircraft); 57 were lost. The attack failed to identify the target, and little damage was done.Middlebrook 1996, p.466 * Night of 27/28 January 1944: Berlin was the target for 515 Lancasters and 15 Mosquitos (530 aircraft). RAF records state that the bombing appeared to have been spread well up- and down-wind. The diversions were partially successful in diverting German night fighters but 33 Lancasters were lost, 6.4 per cent of the heavy bombers; 167 sorties were flown against other targets, one aircraft was lost. * Night of 28/29 January 1944: Berlin was attacked by 432 Lancasters, 241 Halifaxes and four Mosquitos (677 aircraft). Western and southern districts, partly covered cloud, were hit in what RAF records call the most concentrated attack of this period. German records mention that 77 places outside the city were hit. A deception raid and routing over Northern Denmark did not prevent the German air defences shooting down 46 aircraft, 6.8 per cent of the force. Just over 100 aircraft attacked other targets. * Night of 29/30 January 1944: Small raids on Duisburg and Herbouville flying-bomb site, by of 22 Mosquitos. No aircraft lost. * Night of 30/31 January 1944: Berlin was attacked by 440 Lancasters, 82 Halifaxes and 12 Mosquitos (534 aircraft) 33 bombers lost (6.2 per cent). A further 76 sorties were flown against other targets; no losses. * Night of 14/15 February 1944: Berlin was bombed by 891 aircraft (561 Lancasters, 314 Halifaxes and 16 Mosquitos) the largest Berlin raid of the war. Despite cloud cover, most important war industries were hit, including Siemensstadt, the centre and south-western districts worst hit. A spoof by 24 Lancasters of 8 Group on Frankfurt-on-the-Oder failed and the RAF lost 43 aircraft, 26 Lancasters and 17 Halifaxes, 4.8 per cent. A further 155 sorties were flown against other targets. * Night of 24/25 March 1944: Berlin was the main target. The bomber stream was scattered and those that reached the city bombed well out to the south-west of the Gro√üstadt. The RAF lost 72 aircraft, 8.9 per cent of the force. * Night of 26/27 March 1944: Essen attacked by 476 Lancasters, 207 Halifaxes, 22 Mosquitoes (705 aircraft).Middlebrook 1996, p.485 * Night of 30/31 March 1944: Nuremberg attacked by 572 Lancasters, 214 Halifaxes and nine Mosquitos (795 aircraft). Unusually clear weather and contrails lower than usual, and the bomber stream being flown in on a straight track instead of evasive routing, led the Germans quickly to decide that Nuremberg was the target. The night fighters reached the bomber stream at the Belgian border; more than 82 bombers were lost before Nuremberg and 13 bombers were shot down on the return, an 11.9 per cent loss. It was the costliest RAF Bomber Command mission of the war and ended the Battle of Berlin. Pilot Officer Cyril Barton, a Halifax pilot of 578 Squadron, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

The Emsland test track runs from Lathen, near where the accident occurred, north to D√∂rpen, with a loop at each end and a depot side track near the southern loop. Speeds of up to 450 km/h (280 mph) are reached on the test track. Maglev trains use powerful magnets to hover above the tracks. The accident Every morning a wheeled, diesel-powered maintenance vehicle ran along the tracks to check them for debris. When its work was finished it would wait in front of the last switch. There were two workers on the maintenance vehicle. They radioed the line dispatcher for clearance to leave the track but did not get a response. They were unaware of a test run scheduled that morning half an hour earlier than usual. The test run was carrying visitors from associated companies, including employees at Transrapid, workers from a local nursing care company, and workers from local utility company RWE. The maglev train was boarded according to usual routine. It left the station at 09:43 and firstly went for a brake test, then had to wait for clearance from the line dispatcher. The line dispatchers energized the tracks at 09:52 and one line dispatcher radioed the maglev train to proceed. No communication with the maintenance vehicle is recorded. The train rapidly accelerated to the 170 km/h that was common for the first test round before the 450 km/h on the subsequent test rounds. maintenance vehicle in normal operation The train started moving at 09:53, and 57seconds later emergency braking was recorded. Approximately half a second and 25metres later the maglev train hit the maintenance vehicle at a speed of 162km/h. The aerodynamic design of the Transrapid train caused it to dive under the 60-tonne maintenance vehicle, ripping off the roof of the maglev train. The wreckage continued for another 300 metres on the track before coming to a halt. There were 23 fatalities and 11 injuries, 10 severe.\\"Ermittlungen nach schwerem Transrapid-Unfall im Emsland\\" . NDR Online. Retrieved 23 September 2006. The two-man crew of the maintenance vehicle were among the survivors as they were at the opposite end of the vehicle. Three survivors from the Transrapid were rescued by removing the bottom panel when they were heard knocking underneath. Two engineers sitting in the rear section of the maglev survived, and three other passengers were saved later by cutting through the remains of the maglev train. None escaped unscathed. Emergency response Firefighters used turntable ladders and aerial platforms to reach the wreckage above ground level. Immediate aftermath Immediately after the accident, German transport minister Wolfgang Tiefensee held an emergency meeting with representatives from Siemens AG and ThyssenKrupp, the two companies jointly responsible for the Transrapid. He commented afterwards that \\"major safety failings\\" were the clear cause of the accident, and that two key questions requiring answers were whether the Transrapid's safety measures were adequate, and whether they were applied on the test track. He also promised an independent inquiry. German Chancellor Angela Merkel left a conference in Berlin in order to attend the scene.\\"German maglev train crash leaves at least 23 dead\\".

Rudolf Schwarz, head of operators at test track operator IABG, said, \\"This accident would not have been possible if all regulations were adhered to.\\" According to IABG, the crew of the maintenance vehicle, which clears the test track of debris and dirt every morning, was supposed to radio the line dispatcher once the work was finished. German police therefore suspected human error as the likely cause of the accident. Prosecutors obtained and examined radio transcripts from the vehicles involved. In May 2008, a court in Osnabr√ºck concluded that the tragedy was caused by a chain of human errors, including the failure to set an electronic braking system that would have prevented the train from operating while maintenance work was being carried out. Two staff members were found guilty on 23 counts of manslaughter and 11 counts of causing negligent injury and were fined 24,000 and 20,000 euros respectively. The line dispatcher who radioed the clearance to the maglev train was unable to take part in the trial because of suicide fears. The trial of the two line dispatchers both resulted in convictions and prison sentences of one year and six months in one case, and one year in the other. Both sentences were suspended as the defendants were exceptionally remorseful, still mentally ill, and retired. They accepted the verdicts immediately.

It is surrounded on three sides by rivers, and consists of prime agricultural land, with sparse settlement. It is dependent on pumped drainage to prevent it from flooding. Between 1759 and 1962 the area was managed by the Commissioners of the Burnt Fen First Drainage District, who were then replaced by the Burnt Fen Internal Drainage Board, when the area of responsibility was expanded. Funding for the drainage works is collected by a system of rates, paid by those whose property would be threatened by flooding without the works. Location Burnt Fen is located near the eastern borders of the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, although parts of it are also located in Suffolk and Norfolk. It is an area of prime agricultural land, which is mostly below sea level, and all of it is below the normal flood levels of the rivers which surround it on three sides. These comprise the River Great Ouse (or Ten Mile River) on the north western edge, the River Little Ouse (or Brandon Creek) on the north eastern edge and the River Lark on the south western edge. The area is crossed by the A1101 Littleport to Mildenhall road, which runs broadly north west to south east, and the Ely to Norwich Railway, which runs from east to west. There are four hamlets within this area, Little Ouse, Shippea Hill, Sedge Fen and Mile End.Burnt Fen Internal Drainage Board: Conservation , accessed 22 June 2009 Shippea Hill railway station was called Burnt Fen between 1885 and 1904. Because of the low-lying nature of the terrain, the area is entirely dependent on pumped drainage to prevent it from being flooded. The Commissioners of the Burnt Fen First District were formed by Act of Parliament in 1759, and managed the drainage ditches and pumping stations until 1962, when the Burnt Fen Drainage District was expanded a little, and a new Internal Drainage Board was constituted to manage the area. They are responsible for of land, which includes of drainage ditches and two pumping stations, one on the River Lark, and the other on the Great Ouse. Water flows along the drainage channels by gravity, and is then lifted by up to to enter the high level rivers. The name \\"Burnt Fen\\" is believed to originate from the practice of levelling the land, which has been carried out since the mid 17th century. Large tufts of rushes, which made the land surface rough, were cut and dried. Once dried, they could be burnt, and the ashes used as fertiliser.Beck Row Parish Council, History of Burnt Fen, accessed 11 July 2009 This practice, known as paring and burning, was used widely in the Fens, and was advocated by Walter Blith in his book The English Improver Improved, published in 1652. He suggested that it should be used on the lowest levels of fen land which had been 'long drowned', and recorded details of the practical application of the process to an area of in the Bedford Level. Archaeology The area shows a remarkable amount of archaeological findings of the Mesolithic period. One of the largest hoards of Bronze-Age artifacts ever unearthed in western Europe was found near Isleham. Many of the 6,000 pieces are on show at the Moyses Hall Museum, located in Bury St Edmunds. History A sugar beet clamp on Burnt Fen. The flat nature of the terrain can be seen. Burnt Fen is part of the South Level of the Fens, and as such was judged to have been drained satisfactorily as a result of the work of the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden and his Adventurers in 1652. The courses of a number of rivers had been altered to improve drainage and reclaim land for agriculture, and a thanksgiving service was held in Ely Cathedral to celebrate the event. Burnt Fen was a low-lying region surrounded on three sides by the River Great Ouse, the River Little Ouse, and the River Lark. From the beginning, there were tensions between those who wanted to use the rivers for navigation and those who wanted to use them for drainage, to the extent that when Denver Sluice was demolished by an extremely high tide in 1713, the towns of Cambridge and Thetford petitioned against its reconstruction. However, a more serious problem for the Burnt Fen area was the steady shrinkage of the land surface as the water was removed from the peat soils, and the blowing away of the light soil as it dried out. Water could no longer flow by gravity from the land into the rivers. Although the Bedford Level Corporation was responsible for the main rivers in the region, they did not have control of the smaller tributaries. Landowners could and did build windmills to act as drainage engines, but there was no overall policy, with the result that there were legal disputes, with one landowner complaining that a neighbour's drainage mill resulted in flooding of surrounding properties. The First Commissioners Against this background, a private Act of Parliament was obtained in 1759, which created two drainage districts. Each had its own set of Commissioners, and the boards were called the Burnt Fen First District and the Burnt Fen Second District. The area controlled by the First District broadly covers the area known as Burnt Fen today, while the Second District is known as Lakenheath Little Fen. Besides notables such as the Lord Bishop of Ely and others, every person who owned of \\"taxable land\\" was a commissioner, and people who owned over of land could vote annually for several elected commissioners. \\"Taxable land\\" consisted of any land that might be affected by flooding, and would therefore benefit from drainage measures. The Commissioners met for the first time on 6 June 1760, and planned the take- over of all of the drainage mills in the region, the construction of new ones, and the digging of the main drainage channels which would feed surface water to the mills and into the rivers. To finance these operations, there were empowered to borrow money, and to charge a drainage rate of 1 shilling (5p) per acre, rising to 1/6d (7.5p) after seven years. The costs of carrying out such work were grossly optimistic, and the commissioners were soon in financial difficulties. Despite this, and heavy flooding in the winter of 1761/2, which resulted in no taxes being collected, the Commissioners owned eight mills by 1774, each of which used a scoop wheel to lift water into the rivers. The costs of maintenance and repair of the mills were high, not helped by the Naval shipbuilding programme driving up the cost of oak. Part of the defence of the area involved the construction of a cross bank across its south eastern edge, to prevent flood water from the Lakenheath Little Fen reaching the Burnt Fen. The costs of building this were large, as were the costs of maintaining the river banks, and so in 1772, a second Act of Parliament was obtained, authorising the raising of the drainage rate to 2 shillings (10p) per acre for ten years, and the imposing of penalties for late payment of the rates. A third Act was obtained in 1796, to raise the rates to 3/6 (17.5p) per acre, and kept them solvent for another eleven years. By 1807, they had borrowed ¬£11,500 to finance the work, with little prospect of being able to pay it back. A fourth Act of Parliament increased the rates again, and changed the constitution of the Commissioners. Progress was not always smooth. Young, writing in 1794, recorded that there had been serious breaches of the banks in 1777, which had resulted in the ruin of many of the proprietors. However, a machine called the bear had been used to dredge the bottoms of the rivers, and in 1782, servants of the former proprietors had bought plots of land at reduced prices, which had proved to be profitable. He noted that one estate, bought for ¬£200, could be sold for ¬£2,000, following the completion of better banks and mills. quoted in Mechanisation Wind engines had the inherent design fault that they would only work when the wind blew, and could therefore be unusable when they were most needed. The Commissioners therefore turned their attention to mechanising the pumping mills, and employed Mr. W. C. Mylne to advise them on the relative benefits of steam and gas engines in 1829. His report recommended the use of steam engines, and so a engine was ordered from Boulton Watt and Co., which would drive two scoop wheels. The engine cost ¬£1,184, and the engine house another ¬£835. It was installed where the Whitehouse Drain met the River Little Ouse (otherwise known as Brandon Creek), and was commissioned in 1832, when it became known as the Brandon Engine. There were initial teething problems, which resulted in one of the scoop wheels being removed, repairs to the boiler, and a second boiler being installed, but once these problems had been sorted out, it became obvious that the new system was an efficient way to drain the Fens. The Brandon Engine served the north part of the Fen, and the Commissioners decided that a similar engine should serve the south of the District. Tenders were invited, and Boulton Watt and Co. again supplied a engine, this time with three boilers. The chosen location on the River Lark required the construction of the Engine Drain. Purchase of the land for the new drain was protracted, but once obtained, the engine was commissioned in 1842 and there were no significant teething problems. The Brandon Engine was thought to be worn out by 1848, and a new Cornish type boiler was fitted. Experiments were carried out to try to improve the lift and efficiency of the scoop wheels, as the land levels, and consequently the depth of the drains, continued to sink. Larger scoop wheels were fitted to the Brandon Engine in 1860, and to the Lark Engine shortly afterwards. The financial standing of the Drainage District had steadily improved since the 1807 Act, and they were repaying the money borrowed in earlier years. A Fifth Burnt Fen Act was obtained in 1823, which recognised the damage done to river banks by horses and commercial traffic using them, and made provision for such use to be charged. The burden of repair costs to river banks was further lightened by an annual contribution from the Bedford Level Corporation, and also from the Turnpike Commissioners, who had built a road close to the course of the River Great Ouse on the north western edge of the Fen, although this latter sum proved difficult to obtain at times. Under the Acts of Parliament obtained in 1759, 1773, 1797, and 1807, two drainage districts had been set up, called the Burnt Fen First District and the Burnt Fen Second District. Re-organisation in 1879 resulted in the First District being renamed the Burnt Fen District, while the Second District became the Mildenhall District. The Steam Age By 1882, the scoop wheels had reached the practical limits of improvement, and the Commissioners asked George Carmichael to act as a consulting engineer, and advise on how centrifugal pumps could be utilised. Carmichael recommended a new engine and pump, and an engine was obtained from Hathorn Davey and Co., which would drive a horizontally mounted centrifugal pump of diameter. Completion of the Lark Engine installation was delayed by failure to achieve the quoted output, and by flood levels affecting the construction of the outfall tunnel, but the problems were resolved by November 1883, and the Commissioners were able to delay taking a decision on the Brandon Engine because of the efficiency of the new engine. When they turned their attention to the Brandon Engine in 1890, it was in a worse state than expected. The drains in the northern and southern sections of the Burnt Fen were by then interconnected, so that either engine could pump the whole area in an emergency, and plans for a new Brandon Engine were made immediately. Following the success of the Lark Engine, Hathorn, Davey and Co. were contacted, and supplied a pump set capable of pumping 75 tons per minute, which was operational by October 1892. Although the pump worked well, there were protracted arguments over a set of spanners which had been invoiced as an \\"extra\\". The Commissioners had employed teams of gaulters throughout the 19th and early 20th century, who got their name from the use of an impervious type of clay called gault, which was obtained from Roswell Pits at Ely, and used to repair the banks of the rivers and the cross dyke. The teams consisted of three men, who managed a train of five boats between them, each capable of holding 8 tons of gault. The boats were owned by the Commissioners, but the men were responsible for the provision of a horse, shovels and barrows. In 1886, new terms of employment were negotiated by the Commissioners, as they felt that the wages earned by the men were excessive. In 1920, the Ouse Drainage Board was established, and responsibility for the maintenance of the river banks passed to them, so the Commissioners laid off the men and sold the boats. Modernisation With the land surfaces still sinking, the Commissioners looked at ways to improve the discharge of the engines in 1919, but did not take any immediate action. Instead, they considered the replacement of the steam engines by oil engines, and in 1924 asked Blackstone and Company Limited to supply two oil engines, each with a Gwynne rotary pump, capable of pumping 150 tons per minute. The engines were to be erected alongside the existing engines, which could then still be used as a backup in an emergency. The new Brandon engine was installed by Autumn 1925, but the completion of the Lark engine was celebrated in a much grander style, with all taxpayers from the district being invited to the opening, which was followed by a lunch party. 1926 saw further improvements, when the traditional use of spades and barrows to maintain the drains was superseded by a petrol/paraffin dragline excavator, obtained from Priestman Bros. Limited. The Brandon steam engine did not last long as a standby as it was de- commissioned in April 1927 and finally sold for scrap for ¬£25 in 1933. The Lark engine fared better, and although little used, was maintained in working order until 1945. Further consideration was given to upgrading the engines in 1939, but the start of the Second World War delayed implementation. Approval was eventually obtained to install a Crossley engine driving a Gwynne rotary pump, capable of pumping 150 tons per minute in 1941, but it was January 1945 before work was completed. The Lark steam engine was sold for scrap in July, and the engine house converted into a workshop. The Brandon site was finally abandoned in the 1950s. The White House drain, which supplied it, had become steadily deeper as the land surface had sunk, and the soil through which it ran was unstable, requiring regular maintenance to prevent slippage. The pumping station was effectively on top of a hill, rather than being at the lowest part of the Fen, and so a decision was taken to construct a new pumping station at Whitehall on the River Great Ouse, which required the construction of of main pumping drain, to connect it to the existing drains. Two electric motors with vertical spindle axial flow pumps were supplied by W. H. Allen Sons and Company Ltd, and the station was opened on 10 September 1958. Diagram showing the arrangement of an electric powered vertical spindle pump. Expansion In 1959, the Commissioners looked into the drainage of several areas on the fringe of Burnt Fen, as a result of requests by landowners in Sedge Fen. A report suggested that the best solution would be the incorporation of those areas into an Internal Drainage Board, and the Commissioners therefore applied to the River Board to enlarge their District by the addition of which included parts of Sedge Fen, Decoy Fen and Redmere. The expansion was ratified by the Great Ouse River Board (Burnt Fen Internal Drainage District) Order, which was passed in 1962. It revoked all of the Burnt Fen Acts, and after 203 years, the Commissioners ceased to exist, being replaced by an elected board of 20 members. The Lark Engine pumping station was upgraded again in 1974. The Blackstone engine was retired but kept intact as part of the history of the district, the Crossley engine became the standby, and the Crossley enginehouse was extended to allow the installation of a Dorman Diesel engine, which drives a Allen Gwynne vertical spindle pump. The work included the provision of a wooden plaque, showing all of the engines which had been installed since the opening of the station in 1842, which was unveiled by Mrs F. G. Starling at the formal opening held on 25 May 1976. Further improvements followed, when negotiations with British Rail resulted in the skew bridge, which carried the Ely to Norwich line over the main drain being demolished and replaced by a culvert. This action allowed the main pumping drain to the Lark Engine to be made deeper and wider, improving flows between the two halves of Burnt Fen. Despite all the changes, the Lark Engine house still carries the inscription penned in 1842 by William Harrison, the Superintendent of the Works between 1831 and 1871. : In fitness for the urgent hour, : Unlimited, untiring power, : Precision, promptitude, command, : The infant's will, the giant's hand, : Steam, mighty steam, ascends the throne, : And reigns lord paramount alone.

The game was played in Michigan State's Spartan Stadium on November 19, 1966. Michigan State entered the contest 9‚Äì0 and ranked No. 2, while Notre Dame entered 8‚Äì0 and ranked No. 1. Notre Dame elected not to try for a score on the final series; thus, the game ended in a 10‚Äì10 tie. Notre Dame went on to win or share the national title in fourteen polls (including the AP and UPI); Michigan State won or shared in three minor polls, and Alabama, who finished with the only undefeated and untied record, won two minor polls.Notre Dame's Championship Record Michigan State's Championship Record Notre Dame was coached by Ara Parseghian and Michigan State was coached by Duffy Daugherty, both school legends. Introduction Notre Dame, which had last won a national championship in 1964 (non consensus), ranked No. 1 both the AP and Coaches' polls. Defending National Champion Michigan State, who had finished the 1965 season No. 1 in the UPI Coaches' poll, but was upset by UCLA in the Rose Bowl the previous year, entered the game ranked No. 2 in the polls. The Fighting Irish, whose bid for a national championship two years earlier was snuffed out by USC, were hungry, while the Spartans had history and home-field advantage on their side. This was the first time in 20 years that a college football matchup was given the \\"Game of the Century\\" tag by the national media, and ABC had the nation's viewers in its grip, with equal parts Notre Dame fans and Michigan State fans. It was the tenth time in the 30-year history of the AP poll that the No. 1 team played the No. 2 team. The Spartans had defeated Notre Dame the prior year 12‚Äì3 holding Notre Dame to minus-12 yards rushing. A fortuitous quirk in scheduling brought these two teams together late in the season. They were not even supposed to meet when the 1966 schedules were first drawn up. Michigan State had only nine games scheduled (even though they were allowed to have ten; the Big Ten did not allow teams to schedule ten regular season games until 1964) while Notre Dame was originally scheduled to play Iowa that week, as had been the custom since 1945. However, in 1960, the Hawkeyes suddenly dropped the Irish from their schedule, from 1964 onward (the 1963 Notre Dame- Iowa game was cancelled following the Assassination of John F. Kennedy). Michigan State was available and agreed to return to Notre Dame's schedule in 1965‚Äì66. The game was not shown live on national TV. Each team was allotted one national television appearance and two regional television appearances each season. Notre Dame had used their national TV slot in the season opening game against Purdue. ABC executives did not even want to show the game anywhere but the regional area, but pressure from the West Coast and the South (to the tune of 50,000 letters) made ABC air the game on tape delay. ABC relented and blacked out the Michigan State-Notre Dame game in two states (reportedly North Dakota and South Dakota), so it could technically be called a regional broadcast. It would also be the first time a college football game was broadcast to Hawaii and to U.S. troops in Vietnam. The official attendance was announced at 80,011 (111% capacity) and was the most attended game in Michigan State football history at the time (the current record is 80,401 on Sept. 22, 1990 vs. Notre Dame).2011 Michigan State University Football Media Guide. The ABC broadcast was watched by 33 million viewers and had a 22.5 rating, but it was not televised again for 37 years until ESPN Classic re- aired it on November 27, 2003. Discovered in an ABC library vault two years earlier in 2001, the telecast footage is mostly intact with the exception of the missing first quarter.Sandomir, Richard. \\"COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Cable Network Unearths Classic Tie From the 60's,\\" The New York Times, Thursday, November 27, 2003. Retrieved November 30, 2019 Scoring Dick Kenney kicks a field goal to give the Spartans a 10‚Äì0 lead. Irish quarterback Terry Hanratty was knocked out after getting sacked in the first quarter by Spartan defensive lineman Bubba Smith. Starting Notre Dame running back Nick Eddy was out entirely after hurting his shoulder by slipping on ice while getting off the train in East Lansing. Center George Goeddeke wrenched his ankle on a punt play. Michigan State jumped out to a 7‚Äì0 lead behind a five-yard touchdown run by Regis Cavender early in the second quarter. Later in the half, MSU added a field goal (by barefooted Hawaiian Dick Kenney). But the Irish came back, quickly scoring a touchdown on a 34-yard pass thrown by backup quarterback Coley O'Brien over the outstretched hand of MSU safety Jess Phillips to halfback Bob Gladieux. MSU took a 10‚Äì7 lead into the locker room at the half. Notre Dame tied the game on the first play of the fourth quarter on Joe Azzaro's 28-yard field goal. Perhaps the best second-half scoring opportunity for MSU occurred during a pass thrown from Jimmy Raye to Gene Washington. The speedy wide receiver had outrun Raye's deep pass and Notre Dame's defensive backfield. Washington was forced to double back, and in so doing was caught by the defense. Tom Schoen's second interception of the game put Notre Dame in a position to take the lead, but Azzaro's 41-yard field goal attempt missed by inches to the right. Later in the game, Notre Dame had the ball on its own 30-yard line with 1:10 left. They needed about 40 yards for a game-winning field goal. But coach Ara Parseghian, not wanting to risk a turnover that could hand the game to the Spartans, chose to run the clock out, preserving the tie and Notre Dame's No. 1 ranking. After making a first down with ten seconds left, O'Brien dropped back to pass and was sacked by Bubba Smith. On the last play of the game, O'Brien gained five yards on a quarterback sneak. The game ended in a 10‚Äì10 tie. Controversy For nearly 50 years, Parseghian has defended his end-of-the-game strategy, which left many fans feeling disappointed at the game not having some sort of resolution. Michigan State fans and other Notre Dame detractors calling him a coward and college football expert Dan Jenkins leading off his article for Sports Illustrated by saying Parseghian chose to \\"Tie one for the Gipper.\\" In that same article, Parseghian was quoted as saying, \\"We'd fought hard to come back and tie it up. After all that, I didn't want to risk giving it to them cheap. They get reckless and it could cost them the game. I wasn't going to do a jackass thing like that at this point.\\" \\"The game ended in a tie,\\" Parseghian said. \\"We didn't play for a tie.\\" \\"Neither Duffy Daugherty nor I expected a tie or wanted a tie,\\" Parseghian said. \\"The game ended in a tie in one of the historic games. Strategically, I knew what I was doing in the game. You have to remember Duffy kicked the ball back to me. My starting quarterback, starting center, starting left tackle and all my top guys were over on the bench with me. We hadn't completed a pass in the last seven or eight attempts.\\" ‚ÄúWe were all shocked going into the tunnel together, and nobody was celebrating or talking and that‚Äôs when Duffy stated. The most famous president of each school, Notre Dame‚Äôs Father Theodore Hesburgh and MSU‚Äôs John Hannah, together went into each locker room to console and congratulate the players. The two visionary leaders served for several years on the Civil Rights Commission beginning in the late 1950s and sat together during the MSU-Notre Dame battles. The tie resulted in 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 seasons for both Michigan State and Notre Dame. The final AP and Coaches' polls put the Irish and Spartans at No. 1 and No. 2, ranking both teams above the undefeated, and two time defending national champion 11‚Äì0‚Äì0 Alabama. Both schools shared the MacArthur Bowl. Fallout Notre Dame beat USC 51‚Äì0 the next week, completing an undefeated (but tied) regular season and solidifying its No. 1 claim. The Irish did not accept bowl bids between 1926 and 1969 (see below), and Michigan State was the victim of two Big Ten rules that would be rescinded a few years later: The same school could not represent the league in the Rose Bowl in back-to-back seasons, and no Big Ten school could play in a bowl game other than the Rose Bowl. So despite being Big Ten Champions and undefeated in the regular season, the Spartans could not play in the Rose Bowl, or indeed any bowl game. Players for both schools earned tremendous accolades for the season including All American honors. In the 1967 NFL draft, Michigan State had four players drafted within the first eight picks of the first round After (but not necessarily as a result of) Eddy's injury while debarking from the train in East Lansing, Notre Dame football never traveled to away games by train again.Forever Frozen in Time.

South Bend Tribune, September 23, 2006 Both teams now make the 160-mile trip by bus. 40th anniversary On September 23, 2006, Michigan State and Notre Dame commemorated the 40th anniversary of the game. Michigan State wore \\"throwback\\" jerseys and helmets from the 1960s era. Notre Dame declined to wear throwback jerseys or helmets. 45 members from the original '66 squad returned. In addition, 1965 and 1966 All American Bubba Smith had his No. 95 jersey retired at halftime, becoming only the third person in Michigan State history with such honor.

Booroola's prolificacy was studied extensively by New Zealand researchers, who provided one of the first examples of the practical application of gene mapping in sheep, by mapping the Booroola gene to chromosome 6 . History The Booroola Merino was started by Jack and Dick Seears of Booroola, Cooma using ewes from their Egelabra flock that gave multiple-births. The Seears gave the CSIRO a quintuplet ram in 1958, another in 1959 and a sextuplet ewe in 1960. In 1958, the CSIRO purchased 12 ewes (triplets or quadruplets) and a ewe who had given birth to triplets. When the Booroola flock was dispersed in 1965, the CSIRO purchased 91 mixed-age multiple-born ewes and moved their Booroola flock from Deniliquin to Armidale. The Egelabra and Mumblebone strains of the Merino can be traced to Gamboola; these were derived from Samuel Marsden's flock, and like Macarther's flock, Marsden's flock was based on South African Escurial, Cape and Bengal Sheep. The Bengal was a prolific sheep imported from Calcutta.

In 2010 it was merged with the Moscow Military District, the Northern Fleet and the Baltic Fleet to form the new Western Military District. History The Leningrad Military District was originally formed as the Petrograd Military District after the October Revolution of 1917 up to the beginning of the formation of the Red Army. The Petrograd District was established as a part of the Red Army (RKKA) by order –≤\\"‚Äì 71 of the Highest Military Council of 6 September 1918. On 1 February 1924, by the order –≤\\"‚Äì 126 the Revolutionary Military Councils of the USSR the Petrograd military district was renamed the Leningrad Military District. Markian Popov was appointed District Commander in 1939. Its main purpose was the defence of the Kola Peninsula and the northern shores of the Gulf of Finland. On the right flank it bordered with the Arkhangelsk Military District, on the left ‚Äî with the Baltic MD. Among the defensive works started in the 1930s to protect the frontiers was the Karelian Fortified Region.  World War II  The Winter War of 1939‚Äì40 with Finland prompted a close examination of the combat performance of the District‚Äôs troops, and for the better control of the 7th and 13th Armies the North-Western Front was formed from the staff of the District on 7 January 1940. Three and a half months later the Front was dissolved back into the District headquarters. On June 9, 1940, directive 02622ss/ov was given to the District by Semyon Timoshenko to be ready by June 12 to (a) capture the vessels of the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian Navy in their bases and/or at sea; (b) Capture the Estonian and Latvian commercial fleet and all other vessels; (c) Prepare for an invasion and landing in Tallinn and Paldiski; (d) Close the Gulf of Riga and blockade the coasts of Estonia and Latvia in Gulf of Finland and Baltic Sea; (e) Prevent an evacuation of the Estonian and Latvian governments, military forces and assets; (f) Provide naval support for an invasion towards Rakvere; (g) Prevent the Estonian and Latvian airplanes flying either to Finland or Sweden.*Petrov, Pavel (2008) (in Estonian, translated from Russian).

The Front‚Äôs forces efforts played a major part in resisting the German attacks during the Siege of Leningrad. By the joint efforts of troops of the Leningrad Front, Volkhov Front, and the 2nd Baltic Front during January 1944 the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive ended the siege of the city. Pressing home the attack, the forces of the Leningrad Front in summer and in the fall of 1944 helped seize Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The Front was reorganized under the Leningrad District into a peacetime status on 9 July 1945. Marshal Leonid Govorov took command shortly afterwards.  Cold War  By 1946 the 2nd Guards Artillery Division had arrived at Pushkin, which would be its headquarters for nearly the next fifty years.Michael Holm, 2nd Guards Artillery Division at http://www.ww2.dk/new In 1949 the 76th Air Army became the district's Soviet Air Forces component, after the 13th Air Army was redesignated. General- Colonel of Aviation Fedor Polynin was the first commander of the 76th Air Army.http://www.generals.dk/general/Polynin/Fedor_Petrovich/Soviet_Union.html Apart from a brief period when the air army was redesignated the Air Forces of the Leningrad Military District from 1980 to 1988, the 76th Air Army would be active in the region until 1998. General, later Marshal, Sergei Sokolov assumed command in 1965. On 22 February 1968, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Army and for its successes in combat and in political training, the District was awarded the Order of Lenin. Marshal Sokolov later became the Minister of Defence in 1984. In May 1960 the Northern Military District was subsumed into the Leningrad Military District, and Headquarters Northern Military District became Headquarters 6th Army.Feskov et al. 2004 p.14 Among the district's divisions at the time was the 156th Motor Rifle Division, formerly the 25th Rifle Division. In 1965 the 156th Motor Rifle Division became the 37th Motor Rifle Division. Up to 1967 the 44th Army Corps was located in Arkhangelsk, and then its headquarters was relocated in Transbaikalia, where it was deployed in the 29 Army.Feskov et al. 2004, corps list page. This is probably the former 116th Rifle Corps, raised in 1946 within 2nd Shock Army in Germany. On 3 June 1968 the District was placed on alert. The Norwegian Army raised its alert levels in response. Within a couple of days the mobilized forces in the Leningrad region reached 11,000 soldiers, 4,000 naval infantry, 210 tanks, 500 troop transports, 265 self-propelled cannons, 1,300 logistics transports, 50 helicopters and 20 Antonov An-12 transport aircraft, all of which were staged in the Petchenga-Murmansk area near Norway. On the evening of 7 June, the Norwegian Garnisonen i S√∏r-Varanger garrison heard the noise of powerful engines coming from the manoeuvres along the entire Soviet front of the Norwegian-Soviet border. Actual observations were not possible over the border in the dark. On that same night the GSV commanding officer ordered all GSV reserve forces to report to their emergency muster locations. The Soviet demonstration of strength lasted until 10 June, when the Soviet forces stood down. In 1979, Scott and Scott reported the headquarters address as Leningrad, L-13, Pod'ezdnoy Per., Dom 4. In 1988 the district's forces were reported as consisting of the 6th Army (Petrozavodsk) with the 54th (Alakurtti), 111th (Sortavala) and 131st Motor Rifle Divisions, plus three zero-strength mobilisation divisions at Petrozavodsk, Alakurtti, and Nagornyy; the 26th Army Corps at Arkhangelsk, formed in 1967, with the 69th (Vologda)Activated 4 June 1957 in Vologda, Vologda Oblast, from the 69th Rifle Division.

At Vladimirsky Lager was the 250th Reserve ('Spare') Motor Rifle Division, at Garbolovo ([60 20 14N, 30 29 55E]) the 36th Air Assault Brigade (effectively an airmobile brigade), which had been activated in 1979,Michael Holm, 36th Landing-Assault Brigade the 229th Rear Defence Division, and at Pavlovsk the 2nd Guards Artillery Division. There were also the 21st Rocket Brigade at Oselki and the 131st Rocket Brigade at Luga. In 1989 V.I. Feskov et al. reported that the 69th Guards MRD had become the 5189th Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment (Russian acronym VKhVT), the 71st became the 5186th VKhVT, the 115th Guards became a storage base, and the 146th Motor Rifle Division was reduced to become the 3807th Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment. The 36th Landing-Assault Brigade was under district control until June 1990, when it was transferred to the Soviet Airborne Troops. Becoming part of the Russian Airborne Troops as the country dissolved, it was active until February 1997. In 1990 the 37th MRD became a weapons and equipment storage base (seemingly by 1990), the 63rd Guards became the 56th Guards District Training Centre, and the 77th Guards was converted to a coastal defence division of the Northern Fleet by 1990.Andrew Duncan, 'Russian forces in decline ‚Äì Part 2,' Jane's Intelligence Review, October 1996, 444‚Äì445. It was then reorganised as a separate coastal defence brigade by 1 December 1994. In 1993 the 5189th Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment was disbanded. Post-Cold War The fall of the Soviet Union caused much reassessment of the Russian Federation‚Äôs military situation. During most of the 1990s, economic constraints greatly hampered military effectiveness. Several formations, such as the 25th Motor Rifle Brigade, formed on 1 January 1993Valdis V Pavlovskis, Russian Withdrawals from Latvia ‚Äì An Update, Jane's Intelligence Review, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 1993, p 166.

Since 1992 many formations and units of the District have participated in local conflicts and peace-keeping missions, especially in the North Caucasus. The 111th Motor Rifle Division (still part of 6th Army) was active until 1994, and then seemingly became the 20th Independent MR Bde, which became a VKhVT between January 1997 and June 1998.Duncan, Jane's Intelligence Review, October 1996, 444‚Äì445, and Duncan 1998. As the 20th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade it shifted formations into the 30th Guards Army Corps. Also in 1994 the 5186th VkHVT at Petrozavodsk was seemingly upgraded into the 30th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade. In early December 1997, President Boris Yeltsin said in Sweden that Russia would make unilateral reductions to forces in the northwest, which included the Leningrad Military District. He promised that land and naval units would be reduced by 40 per cent by January 1999.James Meek and David Fairhall, ‚ÄòYeltsin Slashes Baltic Force‚Äô, The Guardian, Dec. 4, 1997 In May 1999, when Russian defense minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev confirmed that the cuts had taken place, Sergeyev said that the personnel of the Leningrad Military District had been drawn down by 52 per cent.Interfax, ‚ÄòDefense Minister Segeyev gives details of cuts to northwest forces‚Äô, May 6, 1999 In terms of formations, the series of disbandments left the district almost unrecognisable. The 6th Army‚Äôs staff at Petrozavodsk, the staff of the 30th Guards Army Corps at Vyborg, and all the motor rifle divisions previously in the district disbanded (including the 54th Guards MRD, reduced in size to a brigade and then which became a storage base, and the 64th Guards, reduced to a storage base). Left in their place were a number of weapons and equipment storage sites, and two motor rifle brigades (between January 1997 and June 1998 the 45th Guards MRD was reduced in size to become the 138th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, and the 131st was reduced in size to become the 200th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade).Andrew Duncan, 'Russia and Ukraine: Restructuring for a New Era,' Jane's Intelligence Review, June 1998, 6‚Äì7. See also motor rifle division ‚Äì motor rifle brigade transition list at Feskov et al. 2013, 179. In terms of air forces, after the collapse of the Soviet Union the 76th Army of the Soviet Air Forces and the 6th Air Army of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, were left operating in the district. The two forces were merged as the 6th Army of VVS and PVO in 1998.Piotr Butowski, 'Russia's new air force enters a tight manoeuvre,' Jane's Intelligence Review, May 1999, p.18Leningrad Military District MapThe 138th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade at Kamenka was deployed for operations during the Second Chechen War, in which, along with other Russian Ground Forces units, its personnel was reported to have behaved badly at times.Some Provisional Notes On Current Russian Operations In Dagestan & Chechnya A 22-year-old woman in Ingushetia was shot by drunken soldiers from the brigade scavenging for alcohol. The deployment of a tank battalion of the brigade was apparently halted when it was discovered that soldiers had been selling the explosive from their tanks' reactive armour. The second fully operational brigade in the district, the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade descends from the World War II-era 45th Rifle Division, which later became the 131st Motor Rifle Division. In 2006‚Äì07, the 35th Base for Storage of Weapons & Equipment, the former 54th Motor Rifle Division at Alakurtti, was disbanded.According to Soldat.ru online forum conversation in August 2007, as from 1 December 2006 (–§–æ—Ä—É–º); according to Michael Holm, in 2007: . The Russian Airborne Troops' 76th Air Assault Division was also based within the district's boundaries, at Pskov. Presidential Decree 900 dated July 27, 1998 gave the District's composition as the Republic of Karelia, the Komi Republic, Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Leningrad, Murmansk, Novgorod, and Pskov oblasts, Saint Petersburg, and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. The district headquarters is now in the General Staff Building on Palace Square in Saint Petersburg.

John Nevill until 1826 and Viscount Nevill from 1826 to 1843, was an English peer. He was wounded while on active service in the Peninsular War, and after the close of the Napoleonic War, took holy orders, holding family livings in Norfolk and Suffolk. The deaths of his two elder brothers made him heir to his father's earldom, to which he succeeded in 1843, but he was in delicate health and died in 1845. The third son of Henry Nevill, 2nd Earl of Abergavenny and his wife Mary Robinson, he was born on 25 December 1789 and baptised on 27 February 1790 at Isleworth, Middlesex. On 20 October 1807, he purchased a second lieutenant's commission in the 23rd Regiment of Foot. He went out with the second battalion of the regiment to Ireland in November, and later served with the regiment in the Peninsular War. Nevill was promoted to lieutenant on 8 April 1809. After the Battle of Vittoria, he obtained one of Joseph Bonaparte's coats, which he brought back to the family home of Eridge Castle as a souvenir. Nevill was wounded at the Battle of Sorauren. On 27 January 1814, he purchased a captaincy in the 99th Regiment of Foot. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Nevill returned home to take up an entirely new career and become a clergyman. He was admitted fellow-commoner to Christ's College, Cambridge on 11 November 1816 and received his MA in 1818. He was ordained deacon on 3 March 1817 and priest on 5 April 1817, and was then appointed vicar of Frant, Sussex on 13 April 1817. After the death of Augustus Beevor left a vacancy, Nevill was presented by his father as rector of Bergh Apton, Norfolk, and Otley, Suffolk on 10 July 1818, and on 14 July 1818, he was appointed chaplain to the Prince Regent. He resigned the vicarage of Frant on 23 September 1818 in favor of his younger brother William. In 1826, the death of his elder brother Ralph made Nevill his father's heir apparent, with the style of \\"Viscount Nevill\\". He resigned his two rectories on 15 April 1831. Nevill's health was very poor after about 1842, and as a consequence, he only once attended the House of Lords after succeeding his father in the earldom in 1843. He died on 12 April 1845 at Eridge Castle; he had never married, and on his death the earldom passed to his younger brother, William. The 3rd Earl was buried at Frant on 22 April 1845.

Inspired by the 1886 novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson, the film follows the story of two American detectives visiting Edwardian London who become involved with the hunt for Dr. Jekyll, who is responsible for a series of murders.Jacobs, Stephen (2011) Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster, Tomahawk Press p.365  Plot  A rash of murders (by an unknown \\"monster\\") is plaguing London, and police are baffled. A newspaper reporter, Bruce Adams (Craig Stevens), finds one of the murder victims while coming home from a bar at night and calls the police. The next day, two American policemen, Slim (Bud Abbott) and Tubby (Lou Costello), who are working for the London Police Force, respond to a mob fight at a Women's Suffrage Rally in Hyde Park. Reporter Adams, young suffragette Vicky Edwards (Helen Westcott), Slim, and Tubby, all get caught up in the fray and wind up in jail. Later, Vicky's guardian, Dr. Henry Jekyll (Boris Karloff), bails Vicky and Adams out. Tubby and Slim are thereafter kicked off the police force. Unknown to anyone, however, Dr. Jekyll has developed an injectable serum which transforms him into Mr. Hyde (the \\"monster\\" responsible for the recent murders). When Jekyll notices Vicky's and Bruce's mutual attraction, he has more thoughts of murder, injects himself, and transforms once again into Hyde (with the intent of murdering Adams). Meanwhile, Tubby and Slim decide that in order to get back on the police force they must capture this \\"monster\\" (Hyde). While walking down the street that night, Tubby spots Hyde (whom Slim at first mistakes for a burglar). They decide to follow Hyde into a music hall (where Vicky is performing and Adams is visiting her. Tubby annoys an actor in a far-eastern demon mask by mistaking him for the monster, and gets called \\"barmy\\" ). A chase ensues, and Tubby traps Hyde in a wax museum. However, by the time he brings the Inspector (Reginald Denny), Adams, and Slim to the scene, the monster has already reverted to Dr. Jekyll and Tubby is once again scolded by the Police Inspector. The \\"good\\" doctor, however, asks Slim and Tubby to escort him to his home. Once at Jekyll's home, Tubby goes off exploring and winds up drinking a potion which transforms him into a large mouse. Afterward, Slim and Tubby try to bring news of Jekyll's activities to the Inspector, but the Inspector refuses to believe them. Later, when Vicky announces to Jekyll her intent to marry Adams, Jekyll (who is secretly in love with Vicky) does not share her enthusiasm and transforms into Hyde right in front of her. Bent, this time, on murdering Vicky, Hyde attempts to attack her. However, in the nick of time, Bruce, Slim, and Tubby save her and Hyde escapes. During the struggle, though, Jekyll's serum needle is dropped into a couch cushion, which Tubby accidentally falls onto, transforming him also into a Hyde-like monster. Another mad-cap chase ensues, this time with Bruce chasing Jekyll's monster and Slim pursuing Tubby's monster (both believing they are after Jekyll). The police are frustrated and confused by the monster's seemingly impossible running all over London. Bruce's chase ends up back at Jekyll's home, where Hyde falls from an upstairs window to his death, revealing to everyone his true identity when he reverts to normal form. Slim then brings Tubby (still in monster form) to the Inspector. Tubby then bites the Inspector (and four officers) and reverts to himself, much to the chagrin of Slim. However, before Slim and Tubby can be once again derided by the Inspector, the Inspector and his men have each transformed into monsters themselves (probably from Tubby's bite) and chase Slim and Tubby out of the office.  Cast  * Bud Abbott as Slim * Lou Costello as Tubby * Boris Karloff as Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Hyde * Craig Stevens as Bruce Adams * Helen Westcott as Vicky Edwards * Reginald Denny as Inspector * John Dierkes as Batley Additionally, Eddie Parker was an uncredited stuntman for Mr. Hyde. Production Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was filmed between January 26 and February 20, 1953 and received an \\"X\\" rating in Britain because of the scenes with Mr. Hyde.Furmanek and Palumbo Furthermore, Boris Karloff (contrary to the credits) only actually played Dr. Jekyll and did not play Hyde. Once the transformation sequences were over, Hyde was, instead, played by stuntman Eddie Parker, who remained uncredited. Reception 1963 mgazine article depicting Dr. Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde. The film received a 6.4 film rating on IMDb based on 2,343 user Reviews. Many reviewers complained that, in this version, there was no struggle in the transformation between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, giving the impression that (unlike the usual take on the story) Dr. Jekyll himself was evil and enjoyed the acts of Mr. Hyde. Other reviews complained of the lack of a strong script; calling the production cheap. Rotten Tomatoes has given the film a 6/10 score and the movie stands at an overall rating of 63. It also received an audience rating of 3.4 out of 5 (based on 3,553 user ratings). One critic, Steve Crum of the Kansas City Kansan, gave the film 3/5, saying, \\"Bud and Lou meet another monster for infrequent laughs.\\" Home media The film has been released twice on DVD, on The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume Four, on October 4, 2005, and again on October 28, 2008 as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection.

Peter Vermeersch (born 1959 in Waregem) is a Belgian composer, clarinet player and producer. He is a main character in several Belgian bands such as X-Legged Sally, A Group and the Flat Earth Society. His compositions, balancing between classical, jazz and pop music, are often commissioned for or used by modern dance companies. As a producer he helped to form the first album of Belgium's most prominent indie band dEUS. As such, he is one of the godfathers of the Belgian music scene. Early career Vermeersch's formal training include architecture and urbanization, and a modern art course. He soon got involved with music and started composing. In the eighties and early nineties, Vermeersch was part of the post-modern classical ensembles Union and Maximalist! and composed and performed music for dance productions by Rosas and Ultima Vez. He was also a member of the Simpletones and Kamagurka en the Vlaamse Primitieven. Among his first official compositions is part of the music for the dance production Rosas danst Rosas (1983). Bands Because Vermeersch soon grew tired of the constraints imposed by sheet music, he started his own ensemble X-Legged Sally. In a way, XLS was the last Belgian prog-rock band. In another way, it was the first band of the new Belgian scene. Many X-Legged Sally compositions were originally soundtracks to dance performances. X-Legged Sally split up in 1997. Out of the ashes of X-Legged Sally sprung A Group, who have released two CDs and are currently inactive. A Group mixes the creativity of X-Legged Sally with pure and simple pop tunes. Currently Peter Vermeersch's main project is the Flat Earth Society, a big band that mixes the rich Belgian brass band (HaFaBra) tradition with characteristic topsy-turvy creativity. Compositions As a composer, Peter Vermeersch has his own place among the long list of contemporary Belgian composers, although, due to his lack of formal training and his involvement with pop music, he doesn't necessarily fit in with the likes of Wim Henderickx, Luc Brewaeys or Boudewijn Buckinx. From his early career, Peter Vermeersch has composed music for modern dance productions of renowned Belgian companies such as Rosas and Ultima Vez. Other pieces were composed to accompany theatre plays, such as Josse De Pauw's Weg. Some of the songs of X-Legged Sally have been published as sheet music and performed by contemporary classical ensembles. Apart from these, various ensembles have commissioned compositions, such as a string quartet for Walpurgis and the tone poem 's Nachts brede opklaringen for the Spiegel Strijkkwartet. Major compositions include the oratoria or mini-operas Music Hall on poems by Paul van Ostaijen for Prima la Musica, The Soluble Fish and Charms on poems by Daniil Kharms, both for Walpurgis. The grand big-band opera Heliogabal was written for the Ruhr Triennale and performed by the Flat Earth Society.

Henry Nevill until 1784 and Viscount Nevill from 1784 to 1785. The eldest son of George Nevill, 17th Baron Bergavenny and his wife Henrietta Pelham, he was born on 22 February 1755 and baptized on 19 March 1755 at St George's, Hanover Square. Nevill matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 29 May 1773, and took his MA from there on 8 March 1776. He married Mary Robinson (c.1760‚Äì1796), daughter of John Robinson, on 3 October 1781, and they had the following children: *Lady Mary Catherine Nevill (27 February 1783 - 11 July 1807). Married 2 January 1802 Thomas Myers Esq *Henry George Nevill, Viscount Nevill (22 May 1785 - 8 April 1806) *Captain Ralph Nevill, Viscount Nevill (21 December 1786 - 19 May 1826). Married 2 February 1813 to Mary-Anne, daughter of Bruce Elclock Esq *Lady Henrietta Nevill (14 July 1788 - 28 July 1827) *Reverend John Nevill, 3rd Earl of Abergavenny (1789‚Äì1845) *William Nevill, 4th Earl of Abergavenny (1792‚Äì1868) He considered standing for Monmouthshire at the 1784 election, where one of the sitting Whig members, John Hanbury, was in poor health, but found on consulting Hanbury that the latter intended to stand again. Nevill was also nominated, without his knowledge, as the candidate for Seaford on the Treasury interest and was returned there after a contest, together with Sir Peter Parker, on 30 March 1784. The losing candidates, Lewis Watson and Thomas Alves, were supported by the Pelham family, led by the Duke of Newcastle. Watson petitioned against the election, on the grounds that the bailiff had failed to give four days' notice of the election, and it was declared void on 21 March 1785. In the meantime, Nevill's father was created Earl of Abergavenny on 17 May; as his heir apparent, Henry received the courtesy title of \\"Viscount Nevill\\". Hanbury had died abroad in France on 6 April, leaving a vacancy in Monmouthshire. Hanbury's first cousin, John Hanbury Williams (1749-1819) and Nevill both offered themselves as candidates, but Nevill obtained the support of the Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, and the Morgan family of Tredegar, and Hanbury Williams declined to contest it. Once the field was clear, he took the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds to vacate his seat at Seaford and was returned uncontested for Monmouthshire. While he generally followed the lead of his father-in-law, John Robinson in supporting Pitt's administration, he is known to have broken with them on some issues, such as the scrutiny of the Westminster election of 1784. He was not to sit long in the Commons, as he succeeded his father in the Earldom on 9 April 1785. Abergavenny also served as Recorder of Harwich. Around 1790, he rebuilt the family's old house at Eridge and made it his principal seat. In 1803 or 1805, having moved to Eridge Castle, he sold his estate at Kidbrooke, near East Grinstead, to Charles Abbot. On 23 May 1814, Abergavenny was created a Knight of the Thistle. He died on 27 March 1843 at Eridge Castle, and was buried on 4 April 1843 at East Grinstead. His two elder sons having predeceased him, without children, he was succeeded by his third son John.

Bull sharks are occasionally found in the brackish water near its low-lying outlet. The river includes the Upper Manatee River Canoe Trail for paddlers. Overview The Manatee River has a watershed that is approximately .Manatee River Watershed. 2011. Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Water Resource Management and Environmental Assessment and Restoration, Florida, USA. Lake Manatee, an artificial reservoir, is located about midway in the river's course. The lower part of the river below the dam is an estuary, with Bradenton and smaller settlements located along its banks. The river's main tributary is the Braden River, which runs through the communities of River Club and Lakewood Ranch.  Watershed  The Manatee River watershed lies in the Tampa Bay sector of Manatee County. The watershed covers approximately . The Manatee River headwaters flow in a westerly direction towards the Gulf of Mexico and southern Tampa Bay. Two major river systems make up the Manatee River Watershed ‚Äî Braden River and Manatee River. These two rivers have been impounded to create two reservoirs for potable supply ‚Äî Ward Lake (also known as Bill Evers Reservoir) and Lake Manatee Reservoir. Ward Lake is located upstream on the narrow, winding Braden River. This reservoir, built in the 1930s, covers 255 acres and is responsible for the majority of the water for the city of Bradenton.Ward Lake on Manatee County wateratlas website The Lake Manatee Reservoir is located upstream on the Manatee River. This reservoir, built in 1967, is a 1,174 acre artificial reservoir used as Manatee County's primary water supply.Lake Manatee on Manatee County wateratlas website The Manatee River Watershed has three different physiographic locations: plains, lowlands, and uplands. These locations cause the river to contain areas that are as varied as hardwood swamps, mesic flatwoods, coastal lowlands, and marshes. The highlands include areas with scattered bushes, pine trees, and oak trees. The soil in the highlands tends to be moderately well drained.SWFWMD. 1988. Water management Lands Trust Funds-Save Our Rivers/Preservation 2000 1998 Five-Year Plan. Brooksville, Florida The marshes and swamps have very poorly drained soil and tend to have water-tolerant grasses. The uplands consist of flatwoods which have poorly drained soils. These areas contain saw palmettos and slash pines.  Wildlife  Wildlife that can be found within the river itself includes manatees, alligators, and various types of fish. The Manatee River Estuary is widely used for commercial fishing. Everything from finfish and invertebrates to bait and food shrimp is harvested from its waters, therefore, many commercial fishing regulations apply.Commercial and Recreational Fisheries. 2010. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Tallahassee, Florida, USA As the name would suggest, there are also many manatees found within the river. These mammals prefer warm water so they move throughout the river towards the warmest areas depending on the season. Around the Manatee River, many species of birds can be found and some, such as the wood stork are listed as endangered species. A few of the birds are considered threatened such as the snowy plover, bald eagle, Florida scrub-jay, and peregrine falcon. Other common birds that can be seen around the Manatee River include cattle egret, white ibis, great blue heron, and yellow-crowned night heron.Audubon Christmas Bird Count. 2011. National Audubon Society, Florida, USA  Human impact  Human development has a great impact on the environment of the Manatee River and its watershed. With the increased development of the area surrounding the Manatee River, the water quality within the River has decreased. The use of organic pesticides is a rising fear in the ecological communities. The uprooting of the forested wetlands and uplands has caused excess nutrients to build up in the Bill Evers Reservoir. Also, in both reservoirs there have been increased levels of lead, zinc, and copper.

It is a frazione of the comune of Montorio al Vomano. Geography The provincial capital, Teramo is about 6 miles to the north. Collevecchio rises from the peak of a hill known as \\"Colla Croce.\\" A short distance below the village is the Strada Statale 80 (State Road 80) which begins in Giulianova on the Adriatic Sea, passes near the Gran Sasso (the highest peak in the Apennine Mountains), and eventually leads to another provincial capital, L'Aquila. History Collevecchio is of historical importance in that the Bishop of Teramo traditionally also carried the title, Baron of Collevecchio. The earliest known records relating to Collevecchio date back to 894 when the Bishop of Teramo, Giovanni I, was involved in a land exchange with a count from the Abruzzo region, Adelberto. The Monastery of Santa Maria, which likely fell within the territory surrounding the town, is cited in these documents. In 1813 Collevecchio lost its independence and was annexed by the town of Montorio al Vomano. It was only a small village in the 1800s and an 1881 census lists a population of only 42 inhabitants. The building where the elementary school is located dates back to the early 1900s. Following the construction of a large aqueduct by the firm of Massimo Del Fante, running water reached the Collevecchio in 1935. Rising through the village is a provincial (formerly classified as a state) lane which connects to the larger road (SS 80) running from Teramo to Montorio al Vomano. It was paved only in the mid 1960s. In recent years Collevecchio has lost population. Some of the citizens have moved closer to the SS 80 or to Teramo. Others have emigrated to other countries and regions of Italy. Some two miles from Collevecchio, in the direction of Teramo, is a manufacturer of spirits owned and operated by the Paesani family. One of their most popular liqueurs is called \\"Amaro Gran Sasso\\" (Gran Sasso Bitters) and is famous throughout Italy and in many other nations of the world. Churches The patron saint of Collevecchio is Saint Sebastian and a church bearing his name is found in the village center. It can be assumed that this church was closely linked with the Monastery of Santa Maria located in the valley below. In years past, the practice of building a fortified structure at a higher elevation was rather common as it provided a place of refuge in the event of military threats or attacks. Many such structures were erected following the first invasions of the Saracens in the 9th century. Hence, the hilltop location of today's Collevecchio. With the presence of a monastery and a castle, came the need for a church. By Papal Decree, the Church of Saint Sebastian was constructed. In one document, Pope Anastasio refers the area where the church was built as ‚ÄúMonasterium S. Sebastiani in Gomano‚Äù. A chapel dedicated to this saint may well have stood in this location. The old church bells of Saint Sebastian were moved to a nearby church called \\"San Michele di Colledonico\\". The current church bells are relatively new with the oldest dating back only to 1870. These were cast by the Della Noce Company of nearby Penna Sant'Andrea. On the interior of one bell is the inscription: ‚ÄúFideles voco- Festas honoro-Mortuos ploro-Tempestates fugo-1870 Della Noce T‚Äù. Two smaller bells are believed to have been manufactured in 1914. The Church of Saint Sebastian has undergone several restorations. In 1857 Father Don Paolo Cesi of Teramo, with support of the local people, completed one church modification. A 1900 project reduced the dimensions of the church. Records indicate that one stone used in this reconstruction dates back to the beginning of the second millennium. In the years 1931-1932 the church was adorned with a new balustrade and altars made of marble. Finally, in 1942, the instructor Angiolina Di Salvatore in Sabatini helped to gather the necessary funds and arrange for another church altar dedicated to Saint Gabriel of the Sorrows. The church of Saint Sebastian has but one nave.

Geography Stivichall is a mainly residential area of south Coventry astride the Leamington Road, as with the city centre, on the right terraces of the vale carved by the Sherbourne, an intermittently great stream which rises in Allesley in the borough and flows along the eastern boundary as an upper sub-tributary of the River Avon, Warwickshire. The small suburb of Fenside forms part of southeast Stivichall. To the north and northwest Stivichall borders the War Memorial Park a civic nationally Grade II listed park and garden which separates the neighbourhood from most parts of similarly residential Earlsdon along Coat of Arms Bridge Road. The district of Cheylesmore blends into the area contiguously to the northeast. Much relatively narrower Whitley Common, which is a flood meadow, and one of two dual feeder roads to Coventry's centre on it, separates Whitley to the east. The southern border of Stivichall is shared with the northern border of the city's Finham and Green Lane neighbourhoods along the A45 dual carriageway. The western area of Stivichall, known locally as Styvechale Grange, is a large residential district developed during the late-1960s and early-1970s to cater for Coventry's then-rapidly rising population (which peaked at 340,000 inhabitants in 1971). Incidents of pre-1919 ownership A rural parish on the outskirts of Coventry, the Styvechale manor had belonged to the Gregory family since the 16th century from whom in 1919 the land was purchased by Coventry Corporation and used in part to create the War Memorial Park, with the general development of the remainder following by the 1970s. The main roads from Coventry to Leamington Spa and Kenilworth pass through and join within the boundaries of Stivichall, and whilst the estate was in the Gregory family's ownership, access was denied to the roads unless a toll of 1d per horse and 6d per vehicle was paid to them. The toll house which stood at the junction of the roads was demolished in 1964. Etymology It is thought that the name comes from the Old English 'styfic', meaning 'tree stumps' and 'healh', meaning 'nook' or 'corner'. Although the pronunciation ('Styche-ull‚Äô) of the district is not in doubt, its spelling is a subject of debate. The 'Styvechale' variant is generally deemed more attractive in fitting with the Old English tradition of the district's name, though since 1945 'Stivichall' has been the official designation for the area, and all direction signage currently reads 'Stivichall'. However, in the early-1990s there was a campaign to reintroduce the 'Styvechale' variant on local signage and within civic circles, with many people finding the Stivichall designation ugly. The local bus operators also historically never display Stivichall or Styvechale on their buses and opt for displaying Fenside instead and when route 2 used to terminate in Exminster Road buses had always displayed Cheylesmore, an alternative to this could have been a destination of 'Howes Farm' in similar fashion to the modern Tanyard Farm and Victoria Farm estates in Coventry. Education Stivichall Primary School is bounded by Green Lane and Coat of Arms Bridge Road, where the Green Lane district meets Stivichall.

Styvechale Manor Styvechale Manor (photo 2007) The core of Styvechale Manor may date from the late 17th century and may have been built on the site of a medieval manor house. Many extensions were added to it from Victorian times onwards. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was known as the Manor House, until it became Bremond College, a girls' private school, in about 1935. The property, a Grade II listed building, has since been converted into apartments. Stivichall Hall Stivichall Hall was built by the Gregory family in the 1750s, on a site south of St James's Church, between the modern Montpellier Close and Ridgeway Avenue. It was a three-storey building with a frontage of five windows on each storey, subsequently extended into a seven-window fronted building. In 1928 it was sold with some of the estate to Coventry corporation, but it became derelict and was demolished after World War II. When Major C. H. Gregory-Hood sold the estate in 1932, he gave an area of fields and woods around Stivichall Croft and Coat of Arms Bridge Road to Coventry Corporation for permanent preservation.

The land on which the line was built was owned by the Gregory family, and having opposed the project, in 1842 Mr A F Gregory finally agreed to sell just sufficient land for the line's construction, but only on the condition that the Gregory family coat-of-arms was incorporated into the face of the bridge. The line was opened on completion of the work in 1844. St James's Church The original St James's Church dated back to about 1270 and was demolished around 1800. The present church, situated on Leamington Road, was completed in 1817, having taken seven years to build. It was extended to its present size in 1955.McGrory. p. 116.

First posted to comp.sources.games on 9 July 1987, it is notable as one of the first multi- player games to be released for the X Window System. It was for several years the only turn-based graphical war game available on Unix/X systems. Xconq is released as free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2. Gameplay Originally a straightforward clone of Empire, later versions included the ability to define rulesets for different kinds of games, first using a Forth-like syntax, then a more powerful version based on Lisp syntax. It was also ported to other computer systems, including Macintosh, Amiga, and Windows. Xconq is designed to be portable and re- definable. The default rule set is similar to Empire, but the rule set, graphics and maps can be altered to represent different time periods and strategic scales. Example rule sets provided with the game include Napoleonic strategy, Beirut guerilla fighting, World War II grand strategy and Godzilla destroying Tokyo. It can be played by multiple human or AI-controlled players over a network or via hot seat play. History Stan Shebs started working on a simple Empire clone in 1986, initially using Curses for its interface, then adding an X10 interface.Re: Family tree of xconq, by Stan Shebs, on the xconq7 mailing list, Mon, 02 Oct 2006 09:38:57 -0700 He posted this version to comp.sources.games in July 1987. v01i082: xconq - multiplayer strategy game for X-windows[sic], Part02/07, in comp.sources.games It used a map based on squares rather than hexes, and supported multiple players by exploiting X's capability for a single program to open windows on multiple displays, although it accepted input from only the player whose turn it was; other players could not even scroll their map display. Even this first version included support for three rulesets (the \\"standard\\" Empire-like game, a Napoleonic-era game, and ancient Greeks), but they were defined by C structures and had to be compiled in. Shebs switched the game to use hex-based maps, added a postfix language to define the ruleset to be used when a game started, and changed the X interface to allow all players to interact simultaneously; these versions were numbered 2, 3, and 4, but were not released widely. After the addition of an X11 interface written by Chris Peterson, version 5.0 was posted to comp.sources.games (as \\"xconq5\\") in June 1988. 1989 saw the first attempt at a client/server version, uconq.

While the station's broadcasting facility is at Cannon Hill, its transmitting tower is located alongside the Gateway Motorway in Nudgee. History 4BC was one of the first radio stations in Brisbane. It was established in 1930 by John Beals Chandler, an electrical appliance retailer and later Lord Mayor of Brisbane. In March 1937 the station was sold for ¬£50,000 to the Australian Broadcasting Company who took control in April. The original studio was located in the Wintergarden Building in Queen St and in 1954 the station moved to the corner of Wharf and Adelaide St into what was originally a vinegar factory. The original transmitter site was located at Fig Tree Pocket and was a two tower 5 kW directional array. In 1988 the studio was relocated to 30 Macrossan St and that installation included a Ku band satellite uplink for the first time. In 2004 the station moved from its CBD location at 30 Macrossan Street to new purpose built premises at Cannon Hill in 2004. Fairfax acquired ownership in 2007. Programming In December 2013, 4BC management unveiled an almost complete replacement of on-air talent for 2014. Most continued into early 2015. However, in April 2015, management announced a number of programs would be immediately axed, and a number of announcing staff made redundant, following the merger of Fairfax Radio Network and Macquarie Radio Network. These included long-time presenter and newsreader Walter Williams, Loretta Ryan, Ian Skippen, and former Seven News reporter Patrick Condren. Prior to April 2015, 4BC produced all of its own programming, including a Queensland- wide morning program, from Brisbane which were presented by local announcers.

He participated in the Korean independence movement and as a teenager was jailed for six months in Daegu. Though he was a noted performer of traditional Korean music, he also loved classical Western music and was one of the few of his time who could read and appreciate English language poetry, Keats and Yeats being among his favorites. When the Japanese oppression was at its height, he alone in Gangjin refused to change his name or offer worship at the Shinto shrine. Many of his earlier poems clearly express opposition to Japanese rule, and after Korea‚Äôs liberation in 1945 he voiced his disquiet at the political polarisation that was tearing the country apart. When the growing unrest came to threaten the life of his family, he moved to Seoul, where he died as the result of a shrapnel wound to the stomach during the Korean War. Writing Monument to the poet at his old home Under the penname Yeongrang, Kim Yeong-nang was especially active in literature during the 1930s and 1940s. Most of his poems experiment with modernism at the same time as exploring native Korean rhythms and he was well known for writing in the unique Jeolla dialect. Partly this was because Japanese prohibitions led patriotic Koreans to emphasise traditional aesthetics.Ramesh Sharma, ‚ÄúNew trends in modern literature‚Äù in East Asian Literatures: Japanese, Chinese and Korean, Delhi 2006, p.102 His translator, Brother Anthony of Taiz√©, has commented on the poet's reputation that it is currently growing in Korea. At first he tended to be overlooked in political times because he was only briefly in prison (in 1919), and later because he died before the post- Liberation literary influences and cliques formed. For a long time he was known only as the writer of a single poem, the much anthologized (\\"Until Peonies Bloom\\").Korean Studies The Government's posthumous presentation in 2008 of its highest award for achievement in the field of culture, the Gold Crown Order of Cultural Merit, set the seal on his recognition. The recent translation of his complete poems is now bringing him to the attention of those outside his country. Poet of the Resistance Kim Seon-tae has pointed out in the introduction to his work that Kim risked his life by expressing constant, intense anti-Japanese sentiments in his poetry, and these were particularly apparent in the poems he wrote between 1938-40. Not only does ‚ÄúGeomungo‚Äù (Í±∞Î¨∏Í≥†) appeal to the Korean cultural past, but its reference to the Japanese and to collaborators among his countrymen is overt: The geomungo is a six-stringed Korean zither, an instrument favored by scholars in the past. Here it is identified with the kirin of folklore, a hybrid creature that is normally gentle but becomes fierce if a pure person is threatened by the wicked. Like, for example, the wolfish Japanese, and those among the subservient Koreans who ape them.

Its analog broadcast frequency is 882 kHz AM, simulcasted on digital radio channel 9B, and markets itself for the baby boomer market. It is owned by Nine Entertainment Co. History 4BH 4BH broadcasts from its Cannon Hill headquarters, and is the sister station of 4BC. 4BH (transmitting from Bald Hills) was opened by J. S. Kerr on 2 January 1932. During the 1960s, 4BH dominated Brisbane radio and, under the management of Norm Llewellyn, promoted itself as \\"Top Dog Radio\\" with a contemporary Top 40 music format. In the 1950s and 1960s George Lovejoy provided commentary on Brisbane rugby league matches for the station and replaced Llewellyn as general manager. During the Lovejoy years, the station was branded a \\"Happy Day Radio\\". Lovejoy was replaced in 1975 by Warren Stagg. Some of the well known announcers were Ben Beckinsale, Russ Walkington, Ken Guy, Ken Smith, Peter Kay, John Flemming, Jimmy White, and John Kerr. With the emergence of 4IP into the marketplace with a similar Top 40 format, 4BH added talkback programmes led by Ivor Hancock and supported by a well-known lineup including Don Seccombe, Babette Stephens, Gabby Horan, Peter Clark, Jim Iliffe, Owen Delaney, Father Stephen Freshwater, Jennifer Blocksidge and Pat Thompson. Bob Ackery joined the station in the early 1970s and became the \\"drive time\\" announcer before moving into the \\"breakfast\\" slot, later taking on the role of programme manager and eventually general manager in the late 1980s. He took over from Barry Augustus, who led the station through one of its most successful periods through the late 1970s and 1980s. This included a frequency change from 1390 kHz to 880 kHz in the mid-1970s and from 880 kHz to 882 kHz on 23 November 1978, a relocation of the transmitter from Bald Hills to Wynnum West and a move from its old Adelaide Street home to purpose-built studios at Astor Terrace Spring Hill. In 1988, the station was sold to a local consortium. In 1975, 4BH started broadcasting \\"Beautiful Music\\", which became their focus except for a period in 1994 when the station converted to talk which was up against 4BH's now sister station 4BC and 612 4QR Brisbane. The station successfully bid for an FM license (conversion) in 1990 but was unable to afford the conversion. 4KQ was the second-highest bidder but also failed to produce the required money. In 1995, after the disastrous Talk format experiment, 4BH was placed in receivership and bought for just over $2 million by Michael Norris who was a Brisbane businessman and the major shareholder of Unitel and the Ipswich and West Moreton Broadcasting Corp. 4BH was relocated from Spring Hill to shared studios at the 106.9 QFM building in North Ipswich (now River 94.9). Between 1995 and 1997, 4BH returned to the top two ratings position. In January 1997 Michael Norris sold 4BH to the Australian Radio Network (owners of 4KQ) for over $11.5 million, who owned 4BH until January 2002 after ARN and DMG Radio Australia jointly launched 97.3 FM, so ARN sold 4BH to DMG and in February 2003, 4BH was sold yet again to Southern Cross Broadcasting because DMG had won an auction to set up an FM service on the Sunshine Coast. In August 2002, the station's transmitting antenna in Wynnum West was felled by vandals, causing the station to go off air. The station returned to air a few days later on low power. Two teenagers were eventually charged and pleaded guilty. It later emerged that the reason for the attack was due to a dislike of the transmitter site and also of the station's music. In 2004, the station moved to new purpose built premises at Cannon Hill. 4BH 882 celebrated 75 years of broadcasting in May 2007. A Gala Dinner was hosted at the Sofitel Hotel in Brisbane, the event was attended by former announcers and guests Since November 2007, 4BH, and all Southern Cross Broadcasting radio stations, has been owned by Fairfax Media. Magic 882 On 13 January 2014, 4BH rebranded itself as Magic 882, with a new positioner of \\"The songs you know and love\\". The rebrand came with changes to the on-air lineup ‚Äì Moyd Kay moved from afternoons at sister 4BC to breakfast at Magic; Ian Keenan joined the team from rival 4KQ into mornings; and Greg Victor moving from mornings to drive. In November 2015, it was announced that the station would begin taking network programming from sister station Magic 1278 in Melbourne. The stations on-air presenters and a number of administration staff were made redundant. Talking Lifestyle 882 In February 2017, the Macquarie Radio Network announced that Magic 882 would be relaunched as Talking Lifestyle from Monday 27 February. The launch of Talking Lifestyle into the Melbourne and Brisbane markets followed 18 months of development by Macquarie Media and a soft launch in the Sydney market, from September 2016. Presenters for the station broadcast from either Sydney or Melbourne. The on-air line-up included Ed Phillips, Catriona Rowntree, Nick Bennett, Dee Dee Dunleavy and Sabina Read. Macquarie Sports Radio On Wednesday April 4, 2018, the three Talking Lifestyle branded stations relaunched with a new sports radio format under the name Macquarie Sports Radio with coverage of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The Brisbane Station broadcasts Matches from the Brisbane Lions and Gold Coast Suns plus a Selection of AFL Matches from 3AW as well as Thursday Night and the Early Friday Night NRL Game from NRL Nation.

Dev (Sanjay Suri) is a widower, his wife Payal (Dipannita Sharma) dies soon after their honeymoon. He moves to Mumbai from Pune with his sister Rachna (Bhavna Pani). Here he meets Gauri (Sonali Kulkarni), who lives with her psychosomatically ill brother Gaurav (Rakesh Bapat). Though they fall in love, the shadow of Gaurav's illness is always between them. And then Rachna falls in love with Gaurav: The second love story. The third story is one of how love can be swallowed by ego, pride and insecurity. Vishal aka Krish (Madhavan) and Raksha (Namrata Shirodkar) are happily married. Both are aspiring singers and want to become stars. Though Krish is more ambitious than Raksha, it is Raksha who succeeds first and becomes a rage. Their marriage totters. The fourth love story is that of Hrithik (Jimmy Shergill) and Jojo (Hrishitaa Bhatt). Even though Hrithik is a multi-millionaire and both the families want them married, Jojo refuses to marry him until he gets a job and becomes independent of his father.

It was developed by Daimler-Benz between 1968 and 1975, replacing the M41 and the Sch√ºtzenpanzer SPz 11-2 Kurz. Design The all-wheel drive Luchs made by Thyssen-Henschel (now: Rheinmetall) is well armoured, has an NBC protection system and is characterized by its low-noise running. The eight large low- pressure tyres have run-flat properties. At speeds up to about 50 km/h, all four axles can be steered. As a special feature, the vehicle is equipped with a rear-facing driver with his own driving position. Up to the first combat effectiveness upgrade in 1986, the Luchs was fully amphibious and could surmount water obstacles quickly and independently using propellers at the rear and the fold back trim vane at the front. The 20 mm Rheinmetall MK 20 Rh 202 gun in the turret is similar to the one in the Marder IFV. The upgrade to the Luchs A1 starting in 1986 included the incorporation of a thermal observation and gunnery system, which replaced the original infrared/white light night vision system mounted to the left of the turret. VHF radios have been the German SEM 25 / SEM 35 FM short range radios from LORENZ. HF long- range radio was the AN/GRC 9 with the LV 80 100 Watts RF amplifier for Morse Code. This was replaced by the XK 405 100 Watts SSB HF radio made by Rohde&Schwarz; in Germany and the incorporation of the new SEM 80/90 radio system gave it the designation SpPz 2 Luchs A2. The Luchs was replaced by the Fennek in Bundeswehr service.

The surname MacLennan in Scottish Gaelic is Mac Gille Fhinnein, meaning the son of the follower of St Finnan.Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 240 - 241. History A Victorian era, romanticised depiction of a member of the clan by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. Origins The MacLennans settled around Kintail and were related to the Clan Logan. However some historians have said that Logan was the original name of the clan with MacLennan not coming into use until the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century a feud took place between the clans Logan and Fraser. Gillegorm Logan led his clan towards Inverness to attack the Frasers but was ambushed and most of his men were killed in the battle, that took place at North Kessock. The Clan Logan chief, Gilligorm, was amongst those killed. Gilligorm's pregnant widow was captured by the Frasers and soon gave birth to a child. The Frasers intentionally broke the child's back,The Scottish Tartans, With Historical Sketches of the Clans and Families of Scotland, p.87 who was named Crotair MacGilligorm because of his deformity. Another version of the story is that the child was actually born deformed and was placed with the monks at Beauly Priory. However he disregarded the decree of Pope Innocent III and instead preferred to follow Celtic practices. He married and had children and it is from his Gaelic name Gille Finnan that the clan's name of MacLennan was adopted. The heraldry of the MacLennans and the Logans is similar and alludes to the historic link between the two clans. Crotair MacGilligorm was educated by the monks at Beauly Priory and later founded churches at Kilmor, Sleat and Kilchrinin, Glenelg. His son, called Gille Fhinnein, is the supposed progenitor of the Clan MacLennan. 15th century and clan conflicts The shield of the chief of the Clan MacLennan also shows their link to the Clan Mackenzie, whose banner was the caber-feidh. The Clan MacLennan along with the Clan Macrae were strong supporters of the Mackenzies and may at one time have been custodians of the Mackenzie's castle at Eilean Donan. In 1452 the Clan MacLennan as septs or allies of the Clan Mackenzie of Kintail fought at the Battle of Bealach nam Broig against the Frasers under Lord Lovat and the Munros of Foulis: > \\"A desperate skirmish, which took place some time before this, at Bealach > nam Broig, \\"betwixt the heights of Fearann Donuil and Lochbraon,\\" was > brought about by some of Mackenzie of Kintail's vassals, instigated by > Donald Garbh Maciver attempting to seize the Earl of Ross, but the plot > having been discovered, Maciver was seized by the Earl of Ross, Lord of the > Isles' followers, and imprisoned in Dingwall.

Published in 1894. 17th century and Civil War During the Civil War the Clan MacLennan came to prominence as followers of the Mackenzie chief. The Mackenzie chief was a Covenanter who fought against the royalist commander James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose. The MacLennans and Mackenzies fought against the royalists at the Battle of Auldearn in 1645 but were defeated. At the battle the Clan MacLennan were led by their chief Ruaridh, a red-bearded giant standing well over six feet tall.Clan MacLennan Worldwide History clanmaclennan-worldwide.com. Retrieved 29 October 2013. James Graham the Marquess of Montrose was heavily outnumbered but his strategic genius more than compensated for it. He massed his banners, hoping to deceive the enemy as to the location of his main force. The ruse succeeded, forcing the Covenanters to mass their forces for a full assault. Graham the Marquess of Montrose outflanked Lord Mackenzie of Seaforth, turning the tide of battle in his favour. The Maclennans were sent an order to withdraw, but it was never delivered. Ruaridh and his men fought to the last, defending Seaforth‚Äôs standard. They were finally cut down by the Clan Gordon cavalry. 18th century and Jacobite risings The decimated Clan MacLennan played little part in the Jacobite risings, however eleven MacLennans are recorded as being taken prisoner after the Battle of Culloden. After Culloden the clan system began to fall apart and many MacLennans emigrated to the new world. There are MacLennan Mountains in New Zealand and a McLennan County in the state of Texas, USA. Clan MacLennan today Prior to 1976 there had not been a recognized MacLennan chief for over three hundred years. In 1977, the Lord Lyon King of Arms recognised Ronald George MacLennan as the 'Chief of the Name and Arms of MacLennan'. However, another man, William MacLennan from Sydney, Australia, came forward with proof of his descent, in the male line, from the senior line of the clan. This man's arms were then matriculated by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, yet he did not contest Ronald MacLennan's chiefship despite his senior descent. Ronald's son and heir Ruairidh Donald George MacLennan of MacLennan became Scotland's youngest clan chief at the age of 13 following his father's death in 1989. In 1990, William MacLennan challenged the Chiefship by way of a petition to the Lord Lyons Court. The matter was only resolved in 2000 after William's son who inherited the Chieftainship from his father in 1990 withdrew the legal challenge to the Chiefship. The son of William MacLennan, however, still retained the option of to contest the chiefship.MacDonald 1995: pp. 145-146.

The collections were housed in a temporary pavilion built for the 1929 North East Coast Exhibition in Exhibition Park, Newcastle. The collections and displays grew for another forty years, until the temporary pavilion could no longer meet the museum's needs.

Designed by Oliver, Leeson & Wood in 1899, the building had been the distribution centre for over 100 Co-op stores across the region, and contained extensive warehouse space and offices. The museum was re-launched as Discovery Museum in 1993 at which time the Turbina was moved from Exhibition Park. In 2004 the ¬£13 million redevelopment of the museum was complete and the following year the venue attracted 450,000 visitors.

Then De Lint had a second meeting with Paul Verhoeven: \\"A story with Spetters characterized in fact Paul's position to actors. He had asked me if I would do a screen test for Spetters. I received a script with a lot of trouble. After the second test Paul said that I will star as Rien. A few days later I received a note from Hans Kemna, Paul's assistant, that publicity of Kort Amerikaans cuts across their film and they refuse further cooperation. Have they meant the publicity for Kort Amerikaans at TV - Priv√©?I'm not responsible for that. Afterward they said that I was older than this character and cut across the cast, only I do not seen such note.\\" At last Derek de Lint was presented success with two of the best Dutch films to emerge during the 80s: Rudolph van den Berg's Bastille (1984) and Fons Rademakers' The Assault (1986). In Bastille, which was based on a popular European novel by Leon de Winter, he was brilliant as Paul de Wit, a 37-year-old Jewish Amsterdam history teacher who is haunted by memories of the family he lost in the Holocaust. The Assault told the story of physician Anton Steenwijk whose family was killed by the Nazis during WWII. The film had received the Academy Award, the Golden Globe and prizes at the international festival in Seattle. The Dutch magazine Viva awarded Derek de Lint with the 'Vergulde Klaver' prize as the best actor. From 1987 to 1989, Derek de Lint has appeared in twelve American and European films and TV series, including Mascara (1987) with Charlotte Rampling and Philip Kaufman's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988) with Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette Binoche. He was magnificent as the French philosopher Peter Abelard in Clive Donner's Stealing Heaven (1988), the love story of Abelard and H√©l√¥ise. On television Derek de Lint provided a love interest for Dana Delany on ABC's China Beach as Dr. Bernard. Also he has starred as Russian KGB officer Abramov in The Endless Game (1989), a spy thriller, which was directed by Bryan Forbes from his best-selling novel; and Bertrand de Roujay in a tremendous six-part drama, The Free Frenchman (1989), a story about a brilliant French aristocrat who played a part in the Resistance struggle to free France from the Nazis. In 1991, De Lint was cast as the lead in Highlander: The Series as Conner Macleod (before the character's name was changed to Duncan). But for unknown reasons, he pulled out of the project. De Lint later gained recognition for his role as Derek Rayne in Poltergeist: The Legacy, which ran for four seasons.

He was a half-back, usually on the right side, and is regarded as one of the club's greatest ever players. Robinson played 380 League and Cup games for Norwich after joining from King's Lynn, from his debut on 2 April 1932 at Exeter City to his final appearance on 12 March 1949 against Ipswich Town at Carrow Road, scoring 14 goals. The Second World War took six years out of his career, but for which he may well have become the club's appearance record holder - he also played in 160 wartime matches for the Canaries. He was a member of the Norwich team that won the Division Three (South) Championship in 1934 and was considered an expert penalty taker, as well as a long throw specialist. After retiring from football, Robinson briefly ran a public house. By the time of the club's centenary celebrations in 2002, Robinson was the club's oldest surviving player, living in retirement in Sprowston, near Norwich. Five days after Robinson's death, a minute's silence was held before Norwich's home match against Fulham, and the squad wore black armbands in further tribute.

In Cornwall, fairings contained ginger and became famous around the country when a Cornish manufacturer started selling them by mail order in 1886. The same manufacturer still makes them and the company has recently teamed up with celebrity chef Rick Stein to make biscuits. Description Cornish fairings are sweet and spicy ginger biscuits, made with standard biscuit ingredients such as flour, caster sugar and butter, together with mixed spice, ginger, cinnamon and golden syrup. They are roughly circular and brittle similar to gingerbread. They are created by mixing the dry ingredients with butter, until the mixture resembles bread crumbs, then adding the sugar and syrup before forming the biscuits and baking high in the oven, followed by a period at the bottom of the oven. History \\"Fairings\\" was originally the common name for edible souvenirs sold at fairs around England. Although at Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield, fairings of gingerbread were sold from 1126 to 1800, fairings would vary throughout the country ‚Äî in the northern counties a traditional fairing would be decorated \\"paste eggs\\" at Easter. The Cornish version included the spiced ginger biscuit which became famous in Victorian times. The complete fairing from Cornwall would include the ginger biscuit, along with almond and caraway comfits (colloquially \\"lambs' tails\\" - actually sugar-coated almonds and caraway seeds), crystallised angelica and macaroons. During the 1800s, the biscuits became a treat that young men from the middle or lower classes would buy as a treat for their sweetheart. Previously, the spices required to create the biscuits were exclusive to the wealthy classes, who used them to make cakes. A number of manufacturers started making ginger biscuits called \\"fairings\\" all over England. One example of this was in Grasmere, where the gingerbread sold as fairings was so popular that William Wordsworth's sister Dorothy wrote in one of her journals that she and her brother both craved them. In 1875, John Cooper Furniss obtained a large store in East Bridge Street, Truro, and premises on Duchy Wharf and installed ovens for biscuit manufacturing. He introduced several new kinds of biscuits and also a penny box of sweetmeats with every box containing a small piece of jewellery. Needless to say, these were very successful and in great demand. In 1886, John Cooper Furniss started selling the ginger biscuits at his tea room in Truro, Cornwall, baking them in his Truro bakery. They were so popular that he started selling them via mail- order. The recipe Furniss used is thought to have originated from a \\"maid- hiring\\" fair which used to take place during the week after Christmas, in Launceston, Cornwall although Furniss Foods suggest the recipe came from the fairs held at Whitsuntide or Corpus Christi. Furniss went on to expand his company to Furniss Foods, a well-known Cornish biscuit manufacturer, which created a number of different fairing varieties, such as \\"orange and lemon\\" or \\"apple and cinnamon\\". He also established a Charitable Trust which is still in operation today. It is limited to the parish of Truro to provide assistance to residents in need who use coal as the primary source of heat. The company moved to a larger factory in 1988, but ran into financial difficulties during the 2000s and it was bought by Proper Cornish, a pasty manufacturer, which focused the company's production on the Cornish fairings and a couple of other lines. Cornish foods are an essential element in the county's touristic appeal, with a survey by South West tourism showing food as one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall. During an interview where he was launching a new line of biscuits, celebrity chef Rick Stein explained that he associated fairings with his childhood.

The boat played a minor role in the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939 supporting the Spanish Nationalists.

Design and description The Balilla-class submarines were the first cruiser submarines built for the . They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had an operational diving depth of . Their crew numbered 77 officers and enlisted men.Chesneau, p. 304 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. The submarines were also fitted with an auxiliary diesel cruising engine that gave them a speed of on the surface. They could reach a maximum speed of on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Balilla class had a range of at 7 knots; submerged, they had a range of at .Bagnasco, p. 139 The boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern, for which they carried a dozen torpedoes. They were also armed with a single deck gun, forward of the conning tower, for combat on the surface. Their anti-aircraft armament consisted of two machine guns. Construction and service Enrico Toti was laid down on 26 January 1925 at the Odero-Terni-Orlando shipyard in Muggiano, La Spezia. She was launched on 14 April 1928 and completed on 19 September.Fraccaroli, p. 107 She was named after Enrico Toti, a First World War combatant posthumously awarded the Italian Gold Medal. A notable peacetime mission of Enrico Toti was the circumnavigation of Africa in 1934 along with her sister ship Antonio Sciesa.Giorgerini (2002), p. 159 During the Spanish Civil War, the submarine unsuccessfully attacked the cargo ship on 9 August 1937 during a patrol off Valencia.Frank, p. 96 During the Second World War Enrico Toti was assigned to the Italian 4th Submarine Group‚Äôs 40th Squadron. The sinking of HMS Triad HMS Triad was a T-class submarine of the Royal Navy that had set sail from Malta on 9 October 1940 under the command of Lieutenant-Commander G.S. Salt to join the 1st Submarine Flotilla at Alexandria. In the early hours of 15 October at , off the Gulf of Taranto, she encountered the Enrico Toti, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Bandino Bandini. Bandini, the officer on watch at the time, sighted the Triad on the surface at 01:00, and sounded battle stations on board the Italian submarine. Both submarines altered course until they were heading towards each other. Italian accounts record that the British submarine was the first to open fire with her deck gun, but she overshot. Triad also fired one torpedo, which the Italian ship turned to avoid.Giorgerini (2002), pp. 263-64 Bandini's vessel opened fire on the British deck guns with her four machine guns, preventing the Royal Navy personnel from operating their deck gun and driving them below deck. Accounts show that the two submarines passed within four yards, with Triad cutting across the stern of the Italian vessel. In an account of the engagement published in 1940, Italian writer and then navy war correspondent Dino Buzzati, who interviewed the Toti officers and crew after their return to base, reports that both submarines were so close that an Italian gunner, furious because he couldn't yet train the gun to the British submarine, actually threw his shoes at the head of a British gunner. Enrico Toti launched a torpedo; however it caused no damage to the British submarine. At this stage, Lieutenant-Commander Salt began to dive his ship, however she was sunk during this manoeuvre by two direct shell hits from the 120 mm gun. First Lieutenant Giovanni Cunsolo writes: \\"The submarine sinks, then in a desperate attempt to escape she tries to surface, stern-first, but soon after she disappears under the surface of the sea.\\" The time from first sighting until sinking was 30 to 45 minutes, and there were no survivors picked up by the Italian submarine or any other vessels. For this action, the entire crew and their commander received an award. From March to June 1942, Enrico Toti was transferred to the Italian naval base at Pola, where she carried out 93 training sorties. She was later deployed to transport supplies to Italian forces in North Africa. The submarine accomplished four round missions to Libya carrying 194 ton of cargo. Decommissioned on 1 April 1943, Enrico Toti was converted into a blockship at Taranto, her hull being used as submarines' battery charger. HMS Rainbow It was long believed that HMS Triad had been sunk by a mine, and that the ship sunk by the Enrico Toti was in fact the R-class submarine , which was patrolling nearby and had not been in contact. However, research in 1988 by the Royal Navy came to the conclusion that HMS Rainbow had been sunk in a collision with the Italian cargo ship Antonietta Costa which was part of an Italian convoy sailing back from Valona on 4 October 1940.

At Pen-y-Gwryd, the A4086 Llanberis Pass route bears off to the north. The A498 descends from a 277 m (909 ft.) summit at Pen-y-Gwryd and runs south west through the village of Beddgelert and the Aberglaslyn Pass, where it overlaps the A4085. The A498 then passes through Tremadog, overlapping the A487 for a short length before passing under the Cambrian Coast railway and terminating at Penamser on the A497 about a mile west of Porthmadog. At its northern end, the road forms a link via the A4086 with the A5 at Capel Curig, forming a useful holiday route to the Beddgelert/Porthmadog area. At the junctions, the A4086 to Llanberis is the minor road at Pen-y-Gwryd, while the A498 is the minor road at Beddgelert. At Pont Aberglaslyn, the A4085 is the minor road diverging to Penrhyndeudraeth and at Tremadog, the A498 is the major road. The junction west of Tremadog is a roundabout and at Penamser, the A498 is the minor road. The A498 descends the Nant Gwynant Pass via a 1¬æ miles section with limited width and poor alignmentThere is a steep descent of Nantgwynant and some 1¬æ miles of this is on a substandard, narrow twisting alignment, where larger vehicles have difficulty in passing. There are further substandard sections in the Aberglaslyn Pass and towards Tremadog and coaches have had difficulty passing in this section. The road passes through Beddgelert by way of a sharp right angled bend over a river bridge, not recommended for articulated vehicles. In the Aberglaslyn Pass the trackbed of the Welsh Highland Railway, now being reconstructed, can be seen on the opposite side of the Afon Glaslyn. At its west end, the route crosses the new A487 Porthmadog Bypass at a roundabout west of Tremadog.  Recent improvements  In late 2008 the Bryn-y-felin road bridge was rebuilt under the Welsh Highland Railway as part of Gwynedd Council's WHR Bridges policy. Unfortunately the bridge was rebuilt without a footpath and of such narrow dimensions that any vehicles wider than a standard car find it difficult to pass. It also has a 14' 9\\" height restriction.  History  The road was created from early toll roads. There was some improvement in the 1960s/70s in Nantgwynant and south of the Aberglaslyn Pass.

Born on his father's estate in Ballymurphy, County Limerick he was the eldest son (and second of five children) of Captain Thomas Westropp Bennett, a gentleman- farmer, Crimean War veteran and retired Captain in the 39th (Dorsetshire) regiment of the British Army. One of his younger brothers, George C. Bennett was Cumann na Gaedhael/Fine Gael TD for Limerick County. The Bennetts were an old Limerick family of Protestant gentry (a class known in history as \\"Anglo- Irish\\") who had been resident in Limerick since the 1670s. His father was a Church of Ireland member, but the children followed the Catholic faith of their mother. Westropp Bennett's ancestors followed the usual occupations of their class: Protestant clergymen, Justice of the Peace (magistrates), landowners or military officers; several cousins (Ensign Thomas Bennett and Lt Joseph Bennett) had fought in the Peninsular War and another, Lt Francis W Bennett, died of wounds after fighting in the Battle of Waterloo. Two ancestors were prominent politicians, Hugh Massy, 2nd Lord Massy of Duntrileague in Henry Grattan's Irish Parliament in the 1780s in both the Irish House of Commons and, later, the Irish House of Lords and General Eyre Massey, first Lord Clarina sat in Grattan's parliament and was later a Union Peer. The family had been politically active at a county level, including a Lord Mayor of Limerick, several Freemen of Limerick and numerous JPs. Westropp Bennett was educated at Kilkenny College, where he was a contemporary of Admiral of the Fleet, the 1st Earl Beatty (later First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy during World War 1) and the Queen's Service Academy in Dublin but, unusually, did not attend Trinity College, Dublin where many of his ancestors had studied. On completion of his education, he returned to the Bennett family's extensive landholdings in Limerick and both farmed and took a prominent role in County Limerick life. Career As a magistrate he was active in local government as a district and county councillor and stood for the Westminster Parliament at the January 1910 general election as an Independent Nationalist in West Limerick, with the support of the All-for Ireland League, a non-sectarian alliance of nationalists and unionists, where he came within 70 votes of winning the seat in a close fought contest. His standing in this election reflected a proud family tradition of Irish independence, following on from his ancestor George Bennett, a landed proprietor of Castle Creagh (Gleneffy) House in Limerick, who had signed a petition to Lord Castlereagh in 1799 as a prominent Limerick opponent of the Act of Union. As Chairman of Limerick County Council, where he was a member for the Bruree Division from 1908‚Äì1920, he rose to national prominence in a variety of organisations including the Gaelic Language Association, was founder of the Kilmallock show, the Kilmallock Agricultural and Industrial Society and Chairman of the Influential Ratepayers Protection Association (1907‚Äì11). He was also a member of the District Council for Kilmallock. A noted agricultural expert, he was on the board of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (IAOS) from 1912 where he remained until 1927 with the noted reformer Sir Horace Plunkett. He was elected to the Irish Free State Seanad in 1922 for Cumann na nGaedheal, where he was part of a parliamentary Commission to broker peace in the Irish Civil War. He was elected as Leas- Chathaoirleach to Lord Glenavy in 1925 and as Cathaoirleach (Chairman) of the Senate in 1928, he was vigorous in defending constitutionalism in Irish life during a turbulent time and was engaged in a very high-profile contest with the President of the Executive Council √âamon de Valera in 1935 during the campaign to abolish the Seanad, in which he was assisted by his brother George C. Bennett, a Teachta D√°la (TD) in Fine Gael and later Senator. He also played a significant role internationally, leading inter parliamentary delegations to Berlin, Prague, Istanbul and London resulting in much economic benefit. Committed to the link between the United Kingdom and Ireland as equal members of the Commonwealth, he led an Irish delegation to the Empire Parliamentary Conference in 1935 where he dined with British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, attended receptions with the King George V and the Duke and the Duchess of York (the future King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) and negotiated with leaders of delegations from South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Indian Raj and many others as well as attending a Fleet Review and visiting many cities in the United Kingdom to promote the Irish Free State. De Valera shunned the British link, so Westropp Bennett's role was very important in promoting Ireland as the sole holder of high office in Ireland to appear at these events. Always active in Cumann na nGaedheal/Fine Gael, he was instrumental in chairing talks between Eoin O'Duffy and W. T. Cosgrave in the summer of 1933 in Dublin which led to the founding of Fine Gael. He became Chairman of the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society in 1945 remaining at its helm until his death in February 1962, after a lifetime of public service. He was prominent in many areas of Irish life; he was a member of the Council of University College Cork, Vice-President of the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) (1955‚Äì1962), President of the Hibernian United Services Club and President of the Irish Association of Accountants, among many other roles. A keen huntsman, he remained active in the Country Limerick Foxhounds all his life, and enjoyed shooting, the cinema, horse racing and the Irish language. He married twice; his first wife, Esther Moreton Macdonald, was a Scottish aristocrat. She was the great-granddaughter of Thomas Reynolds-Moreton, 4th Baron and first 1st Earl of Ducie and the granddaughter of Augustus Macdonald, a Scottish Member of Parliament and in the government led by reforming Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Her family home was in the baronial Largie Castle in Argyll where her father (and later brother) were the local lairds. She was a debutante in 1892 when she was presented at the Royal Court to Queen Victoria. They married in 1898 when her dowry was ¬£1200 a year, which helped finance his campaigns; they were married at her family Castle in Argyll in Scotland by Cosmo Gordon Lang, (later Archbishop of Canterbury during the 1936 Abdication Crisis and 1st Baron Lang of Lambeth) Esther died in 1920 at the age of 51. In April 1923, he married Miss Lila Hapell (died July 1976), daughter of William Alexander Happell, who had been in the Indian Civil Service. She had been governess to his niece. Initially he lived in an estate called Ballyteigue in Bruree and then another called Ardvullen in Killmallock before inheriting a small estate called Summerville from a cousin in County Limerick which the Irish Republican Army tried to burn down in 1922; he persuaded it to go away, though he himself was unarmed. His son, Liam Westropp Bennett, stood as a Fine Gael candidate in 1954. His obituary in The Irish Times said that he was from a \\"prominent and popular family\\" in the south of Ireland who had rendered much service during the \\"turbulent early years\\" of the Irish State. In an interview in 2008 Liam Cosgrave, the former Taoiseach of Ireland, who knew Westropp Bennett and his brother George, well said that Westropp Bennett \\"a man of principle....who was held in universally high regard\\".

William Carrigan (29 August 1860 ‚Äì 12 December 1924) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and historian, who was appointed canon of the Diocese of Ossory. Early life William Carrigan was the youngest of 13 children. He was born in 1860 in Ruthstown, Ballyfoyle, County Kilkenny.Manuscript volumes compiled by the Very Rev. William Cannon Carrigan contain an extensive collection of will abstracts. These are deposited in the Archives of St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny. Many of the wills in this collection relate to Catholic families and approximately 380 are from the Prerogative Court for the time period 1546 1857. For a printed index to the wills in this collection see The Irish Genealogist Volume 4, No. 3 (1970), pp. 221, 242. A manuscript copy of the index is in the Public Record Office, Dublin (Ref. M.4879) and a microfilm copy of the Carrigan collection is in the National Library of Ireland, Dublin (Ref N.480 P.902). He received his childhood education in the Ballyfoyle National School and then in Wellington Square in Kilkenny City. He then attended the ecclesiastical side of St Kieran's College. His education was continued at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth today a part of the larger NUI Maynooth. He was ordained by Francis Moran, Bishop of Ossory, in 1884. His first posting was as curate in Ballyragget. Bishop Moran was a distinguished historian, having founded the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1872. He encouraged William's interests in history and he joined the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1884;https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofos312osso/transactionsofos312osso_djvu.txt his first paper was printed in the last issue of the Ossory Archaeological Society in 1886. Sources and origins of his works The 19th century saw a great interest in history. Kilkenny had already seen two major historical works published in 1884, John Hogan's History of Kilkenny etc. and P. M. Egan's Illustrated Guide to the City and County of Kilkenny. The clergy played an active role in these developments; the Rev. James Graves, an Anglican cleric and antiquarian, was a frequent contributor to the Kilkenny Archaeological Society (renamed in 1890 to Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland). Carrigan with his high interest in local history took these developments as reason to create his own writings. The Bishop of Ossory, Dr Brownrigg, encouraged Carrigan to begin a compilation of a history of Ossory. The Bishop would fund his travels and subscribe to the finished works. Carrigan travelled around the diocese speaking at great length to older people, taking count of folklore traditions and oral history. We owe it to Carrigan that we still have these today. He also trudged through existing works and resolved conflicting accounts. All of his holidays were spent in the Public Records Office, Dublin, collecting information that related to Ossory. The History and Antiquities of Ossory William Carrigan was 45 when The History and Antiquities of Ossory was completed. The finished work, divided into four volumes, took six years in the writing, between 1897 and 1903. The first volume deals with the overall history of the diocese from Pre- Christianity Celtic times to the Christianisation and through the Past Bishops and Clergy. The remaining volumes examine Ossory's parishes. It explains each parish's buildings, churches, castles, monuments etc. Townlands are also examined and the origins of their names explained as well as prominent families and tombstone inscriptions etc. Interwoven throughout his narrative in the first volume, is a history of the Kingdom of Ossory and the activity of its rulers, gentry and major clergy; complete with as many annalistic references and other primary sources as he could compile. Illustrations add to in the richness of his work; photography is used to its full extent. The firm chosen to print the work was Sealy, Bryer and Walker of Middle Abbey Street, Dublin. The firm had long experience of printing historical works. 738 individuals subscribed to the work. 840 copies were sold; the remaining 160 were lost in Dublin during the 1916 Rising. The work was well received on its publication and although other diocesan histories exist, none come to par with it for its range and depth. Later life Carrigan was created D.D. by the Pope in 1907. He was appointed parish priest of Durrow, County Laois in 1911. He continued to write and collect material; a further volume was planned but was never published. His unpublished works are preserved in the Diocesan Archives in St Kieran's College. Canon Carrigan died on 12 December 1924 as a result of contracting influenza.Details of death of Very Rev William Carrigan, thetablet.co.uk. Retrieved 28 October 2015.

It lies west of Leyburn. Etymology The derivation of the villages name is uncertain, but Ekwall believes it be mean Cairpe's settlement in Old Norse (Cairpes b»≥). The name Cairpe is of Old Irish origin, implying Norse-Gaelic settlement in the area. History In the centre of the village is a high-stepped cross, dated 1674, that tells of the time when Carperby had a market (granted in 1305). In the 17th century the village was an important Wensleydale centre of Quakerism, and its biggest building even today is the classically styled Friends' Meeting House of 1864. In 1810, the western end of the village supposedly suffered from a fire which destroyed 12 thatched cottages. Whilst there is no documentary evidence of this, it is a locally believed legend and mapping from 1819 and 1856 does show at least nine dwellings as having been removed. The Richmond to Lancaster Turnpike was opened up through the village in 1751. Later diversions meant that the main A684 road was diverted to run through Aysgarth. The minor that now runs through Carperby shadows the A684 westwards along the valley until the two roads meet at Hardraw. The road through carperby is colloquially known as 'The High Road'. The name of the Wheatsheaf Hotel suggests a corn-growing past, and the inn itself was where James Herriot and his bride spent their honeymoon in 1941. In 2004, the village launched a campaign to provide a sports pavilion for its football team which plays in the Wensleydale Creamery League. After years of events and fundraising, the effort was still far short of its goal when the Mars confectionery company donated money to the final ¬£125,000 needed to construct the pavilion. The building of the pavilion was filmed in a time-lapse and used by Mars as a TV advertisement which also had footballer Peter Crouch playing on the pitch at Carperby.

Playing career Haylock, a full-back, came through the youth system at Norwich City and was part of the Norwich team that won promotion to Division One in 1982 and won the Football League Cup at Wembley Stadium in 1985. He played 193 games for Norwich before the arrival of Ian Culverhouse displaced him from the side. He went on to play for Gillingham, where he was a crowd favourite (gaining the nickname \\"Pud\\" due to his slightly portly build) and a member of the side which reached the promotion play-offs in the 1986‚Äì87 season. In a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion, Gills goalkeeper Phil Kite was sent off, and Haylock, despite being the shortest player in the team, took over in goal. The match ended in a draw and went to a penalty shoot out, and Haylock saved one of the Brighton kicks, enabling Gillingham to progress to the next round. He later played for Maidstone United and Shrewsbury Town before moving into non-league football, and captained the newly reformed Maidstone United in the Kent County League.

The game is a 3D rail shooter based on the original trilogy of Star Wars films and was released along with the special editions of these films. Accompanied by the Star Wars Trilogy pinball game, it is the second in Sega's Star Wars Arcade series; it is preceded by 1993's Star Wars Arcade and followed by 2000's Star Wars Racer Arcade. Gameplay The player battles TIE fighters in the mission recalling the final battle from Return of the Jedi. The gameplay has two main themes: three missions that reenact key scenes from the original Star Wars film trilogy, plus a final unlockable mission; and two boss battles against Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Normal gameplay involves the player moving a crosshair around the screen using a joystick and pressing the fire button atop the joystick to shoot. A \\"special event\\" button lights at certain points of the game and when pressed, triggers an event to happen onscreen. The game puts the player in several key battles of the Star Wars films with one mission for each original Star Wars film. The player selects which film's mission to play first and each mission has three parts. The A New Hope mission reenacts the final space battle at Yavin, with Luke Skywalker piloting an X-wing fighter against TIE fighters. The second part of the mission involves flying along the Death Star's surface, shooting TIE fighters and XX-9 heavy turbolaser turret guns, and confronting Darth Vader's TIE fighter. The third part of the mission pits the player within the battle station's trench, using proton torpedoes aimed at the exhaust port to destroy the Death Star. In The Empire Strikes Back mission, the player reenacts the film's opening battle on Hoth. The first part of the mission involves shooting AT-ST walkers and probe droids, and helping other snowspeeders to take down the giant AT-AT walkers. The second part of the mission reenacts the escape from Hoth, running through corridors of the rebel base, shooting Snow Troopers and wampas while traveling to the Millennium Falcon. The third part of the mission takes place in the hangar, again shooting snowtroopers and one last wampa before escaping. The Return of the Jedi mission begins with a reenactment of the speeder bike sequence on Endor from the film, where the player must shoot scout troopers on their own speeder bikes. The second part of the stage has the player moving towards the Empire's base on Endor, shooting any enemies on the way. In the third part of the mission, the player must rapidly fire a blaster at an AT-ST walker. The game's final mission, which is unlocked after clearing the other three missions, directs the player as Wedge Antilles, to destroy the second Death Star. The game features two boss stages that are accessed immediately after beating the conventional missions, although the player is not required to win either to finish the game. In both stages, the player controls Luke Skywalker wielding a lightsaber. In the first boss battle, which is played after clearing two missions, the player has to reflect Boba Fett's blaster shots back at him, in order to knock Fett into the Sarlacc pit behind him. The second, which is played after clearing all three missions, involves the player dueling Darth Vader on the second Death Star. Reception Reviews are generally positive. Christopher Michael Baker of AllGame rates the game at 4.5 out of 5, finding it virtually flawless, with excellent graphics, sound, and play control. The joystick controller is said to provide a reactive feel which meaningfully mimics a lightsaber, but the game's only flaw is a minor imperfection in play control during the two bonus stages against Boba Fett and Darth Vader. Destructoid's Anthony Burch finds the game at a balance between gameplay (focusing on shooting and lightsabers) and story (focusing on the immersive cinematic reenactment of being part of the Star Wars universe). He says that the game's mission designs generally range from \\"awesome\\" to \\"more awesome\\", and the A New Hope missions follow 1983's Star Wars arcade game exactly. He finds the bonus missions' play control to be \\"clunky and linear\\" but nevertheless to feel like a realistic lightsaber could, and to generally be a \\"delight\\".

It was constructed between 1887 and 1895 by John Pennycuick and also reached in an agreement to divert water eastwards to the Madras Presidency area (present-day Tamil Nadu). It has a height of from the foundation, and a length of . The Periyar National Park in Thekkady is located around the dam's reservoir. The dam is built at the confluence of Mullayar and Periyar rivers. The dam is located in Kerala on the river Periyar, but is operated and maintained by the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. Although the Periyar River has a total catchment area of 5398 km2 with 114 km2 downstream from the dam in Tamil Nadu, the catchment area of the Mullaperiyar Dam itself lies entirely in Kerala and thus not an inter-State river. However, by the principle of estoppel it is considered otherwise. On 21 November 2014, the water level hit 142 feet for first time in 35 years. The reservoir again hit the maximum limit of 142 feet on 15 August 2018, following incessant rains in the state of Kerala. Etymology Earlier known as the Periyaru Dam as it was basically meant to dam the Periyaru river, the present name Mullaperiyar is derived by vaguely blending the names of Mullayar River and Periyaru River, at the confluence of which the dam is located below. Purpose View of the dam around 1899 The Periyar river which flows westward of Kerala in to the Arabian sea was diverted eastwards to flow towards the Bay of Bengal to provide water to the arid rain shadow region of Madurai in Madras Presidency which was in dire need of a greater supply of water than the small Vaigai River could provide. The dam created the Periyar Thekkady reservoir, from which water was diverted eastwards via a tunnel to augment the small flow of the Vaigai River. The Vaigai was dammed by the Vaigai Dam to provide a source for irrigating large tracts around Madurai. Initially the dam waters were used only for the irrigation of . Currently, the water from the Periyaru (Thekkady) Lake created by the dam, is diverted through the water shed cutting and a tunnel to Forebay Dam near Kumily (Iraichalpalam). From the Forebay dam, hydel pipe lines carry the water to the Periyar Power Station in Lower Periyaru. This is used for power generation (180 MW capacity) in the Periyar Power Station. From the Periyar Power Station, the water is let out into Vairavanar river and then to Suruliyar and from Suruliyar to Vaigai Dam. Design The Mullaperiyar Dam is a gravity dam made with concrete prepared from limestone and \\"surkhi\\" (burnt brick powder), and faced with rubble. Gravity dams use their weight and the force of gravity to support the reservoir and remain stable. The main dam has a maximum height of and length of . Its crest is wide while the base has a width of . It consists of a main dam, spillway on its left and an auxiliary dam (or \\"baby dam\\") to the right. Its reservoir can withhold of water, of which is active (live) storage. History Feasibility studies The unique idea of harnessing the westward flowing water of the Periyar river and diverting it to the eastward flowing Vaigai river was first explored in 1789 by Pradani Muthirulappa Pillai, a minister of the Ramnad king Muthuramalinga Sethupathy, who gave it up as he found it to be expensive. The location of the dam had first been scouted by Captain J. L. Caldwell, Madras Engineers (abbreviated as M.E.) in 1808 to reconnoitre the feasibility of providing water from the Periyar river to Madurai by a tunnel through the mountains. Caldwell discovered that the excavation needed would be in excess of 100 feet in depth and the project was abandoned with the comment in his report as \\"decidedly chimerical and unworthy of any further regard\\". The first attempt at damming the Periyaar with an earthen dam in 1850 was given up due to demands for higher wages by the labour citing unhealthy living conditions. The proposal was resubmitted a number of times and in 1862, Captain J. G. Ryves, M.E., carried out a study and submitted proposals in 1867 for another earthwork dam, 62 feet high. The matter was debated by the Madras Government and the matter further delayed by the terrible famine of 1876‚Äì77. Finally, in 1882, the construction of the dam was approved and Major John Pennycuick, M.E., placed in charge to prepare a revised project and estimate which was approved in 1884 by his superiors. Lease On 29 October 1886, a lease indenture for 999 years was made between the Maharaja of Travancore, Visakham Thirunal Rama Varma and the British Secretary of State for India for Periyar Irrigation Works. The lease agreement was signed by Dewan of Travancore V Ram Iyengar and State Secretary of Madras State J C Hannington. This lease was made after 24 years negotiation between the Maharaja and the British. The lease indenture granted full right, power and liberty to the Secretary of State for India to construct make and carry out on the leased land and to use exclusively when constructed, made and carried out, all such irrigation works and other works ancillary thereto. The agreement gave 8000 acres of land for the reservoir and another 100 acres to construct the dam. The tax for each acre was 5 per year. The lease provided the British the rights over \\"all the waters\\" of the Mullaperiyar and its catchment basin, for an annual rent of 40,000. In 1947, after Indian Independence, after British India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Cochin joined the Union of India and on 1 July 1949 were merged to form Travancore-Cochin. On 1 January 1950 (Republic Day), Travancore-Cochin was recognised as a state. The Madras Presidency was organised to form Madras State in 1947. On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was formed by the States Reorganisation Act merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks, which were merged with Tamil Nadu), and the taluk of Kasargod, South Canara. The Kerala state government announced that the earlier agreement which had been signed between British Raj and Travancore agreement was invalid and needed to be renewed. After several failed attempts to renew the agreement in 1958, 1960, and 1969, the agreement was renewed in 1970 when C Achutha Menon was Kerala Chief Minister. According to the renewed agreement, the tax per acre was increased to 30, and for the electricity generated in Lower Camp using Mullaperiyar water, the charge was 12 per kiloWatt per hour. Tamil Nadu uses the water and the land, and the Tamil Nadu government has been paying to the Kerala government for the past 50 years 2.5 lakhs as tax per year for the whole land and 7.5 lakhs per year as surcharge for the total amount of electricity generated. The validity of this agreement is under dispute between the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. As of 2013 the matter is pending before a Division Bench of the Supreme Court. \\"Advise Kerala not to build the dam\\", the Hindu, 24 November 2011 The dispute puts into question the power of the federal government of India to make valid orders respecting Indian States, in this case regarding a watershed and dam within one state that is used exclusively in another. Construction Cross-section of the dam In May 1887, construction of the dam began. As per \\"The Military Engineer in India\\" Vol II by Sandes (1935), the dam was constructed from limestone and \\"surkhi\\" (burnt brick powder and a mixture of sugar and calcium oxide ) at a cost of 104 lakhs, was 173 feet high and 1241 feet in length along the top and enclosed more than 15 thousand million cubic feet of water. Another source states that the dam was constructed of concrete and gives a figure of 152 feet height of the full water level of the reservoir, with impounding capacity of 10.56 thousand million cubic feet along with a total estimated cost of 84.71 lak. The construction involved the use of troops from the 1st and 4th battalions of the Madras Pioneers as well as Portuguese carpenters from Cochin who were employed in the construction of the coffer-dams and other structures. The greatest challenge was the diversion of the river so that lower portions of the great dam could be built. The temporary embankments and coffer-dams used to restrain the river waters were regularly swept away by floods and rains. Due to the coffer dam failures, the British stopped funding the project. Officer Pennycuick raised funds by selling his wife's jewelry to continue the work. In Madurai, Pennycuick's statue has been installed at the state PWD office and his photographs are found adorning walls in peoples homes and shops. In 2002, his great grandson was honoured in Madurai, a function that was attended by thousands of people. The dam created a reservoir in a remote gorge of the Periyar river situated 3,000 feet above the sea in dense and malarial jungle, and from the northerly arm of this manmade waterbody, the water flowed first through a deep cutting for about a mile and then through a tunnel, 5704 feet in length and later through another cutting on the other side of the watershed and into a natural ravine and so onto the Vaigai River which has been partly built up for a length of 86 miles, finally discharging 2000 cusecs of water for the arid rain shadow regions of present-day Theni, Dindigul District, Madurai District, Sivaganga District and Ramanathapuram districts of Tamil Nadu, then under British rule as part of Madras Province (Sandes, 1935). The Periyar project, as it was then known, was widely considered well into the 20th century as \\"one of the most extraordinary feats of engineering ever performed by man\\". A large amount of manual labour was involved and worker mortality from malaria was high. It was claimed that had it not been for \\"the medicinal effects of the native spirit called arrack, the dam might never have been finished\\". 483 people died of diseases during the construction of this dam and were buried on-site in a cemetery just north of the dam. In 2012, it was announced that a memorial dedicated to dam engineer Pennycuick would be erected at the dam site. Protected area Periyar National Park The Periyar National Park in Thekkady, a Protected area of Kerala, is located around the dam's reservoir, the Periyar lake. 62 different kinds of mammals have been recorded in Periyar, including many threatened ones. Periyar is a highly protected tiger reserve and hosts 35 tigers above two-years of age as of January 2017 in the reserve. Declared an elephant reserve on 2 April 2002, the population of Indian elephants in 2005 was estimated at 1100, however Periyar suffers greatly from poaching of elephant being the worst affected of South Indian sanctuaries. Other mammals found here include gaur, bison, sambar (horse deer), barking deer, mouse deer, dholes (Indian wild dogs), mongoose, foxes and leopards. Four species of primates are found at Periyar ‚Äì the rare lion-tailed macaque, the Nilgiri langur, the common langur, and the bonnet macaque. According to a report by the Kerala Forest Research Institute, the protected area surrounding the dam and reservoir is classified as a biodiversity hot spot. Dam safety Damage in dam Leak joints in dam Water leaks After the 1979 Morvi Dam failure which killed up to 15,000 people, safety concerns of the aging Mullaperiyar dam's and alleged leaks and cracks in the structure were raised by the Kerala Government. A study conducted by The Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS), Thiruvananthapuram, had reported that the structure would not withstand an earthquake above magnitude 6 on the Richter scale. The dam was also inspected by the Chairman, CWC (Central Water Commission). On the orders of the CWC, the Tamil Nadu government lowered the storage level from 152 feet to 142.2 feet then to 136 feet, conducted safety repairs and strengthened the dam. Strengthening measures adopted by Tamil Nadu PWD from 1979 onwards include cable anchoring of the dam's structure and RCC backing for the front slope. During a recent scanning of the Mullaperiyar dam using a remotely operated vehicle by the Central Soil and Materials Research Station on directions from the Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court, the Kerala Government observer opined that \\"mistakes in the strengthening works carried out by Tamil Nadu\\" in 1979 damaged the masonry of the dam. Current safety concerns relate to several issues. Since the dam was constructed using stone rubble masonry with lime mortar grouting following prevailing 19th-century construction techniques that have now become archaic, seepage and leaks from the dam have caused concern.The Hindu, 22 November 2011, 'Tamilnadu seepage data wrong: says Mullaperiyar cell chairman'\\"Serious damage to masonry of dam detected\\", the Hindu, 7 Dec 2011 Moreover, the dam is situated in a seismically active zone.Singh, H.N., Raghavan, V., & Raju, G.K. (1992). On relation between seismicity and tectonic features of Idukki region, Southwestern India. Geofizika, Vol. 9, 1992, pp. 109‚Äì122 An earthquake measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale occurred on 7 June 1988 with maximum damage in Nedumkandam and Kallar (within 20 km of the dam). Subsequently, several tremors have occurred in the area in recent times. These could be reservoir-induced seismicity, requiring further studies according to experts.\\"Call for studies on reservoir- induced seismicity in Idukki\\", the Hindu, 21 November 2011 A 2009 report by IIT Roorkee stated that the dam \\"was likely to face damage if an earthquake of the magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale struck its vicinity when the water level is at 136 feet\\". Justice A.S. Anand Committee (The Empowered Committee) On 18 February 2010, the Supreme Court decided to constitute a five-member empowered committee to study all the issues of Mullaperiyar Dam and seek a report from it within six months. The Bench in its draft order said Tamil Nadu and Kerala would have the option to nominate a member each, who could be either a retired judge or a technical expert. The five-member committee will be headed by former Chief Justice of India A. S. Anand to go into all issues relating to the dam's safety and the storage level. However, the then ruling party of Tamil Nadu, DMK, passed a resolution that it not only oppose the apex court's decision to form the five-member committee, but also said that the state government will not nominate any member to it. The then late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said that immediately after the Supreme Court announced its decision to set up a committee, he had written to Congress president asking the Centre to mediate between Kerala and Tamil Nadu on Mullaperiyar issue. However, the then Leader of Opposition i.e., the late Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu J. Jayalalithaa objected to the TN Government move. She said that this would give advantage to Kerala in the issue. Meanwhile, Kerala Water Resources Minister N. K. Premachandran told the state Assembly that the State should have the right of construction, ownership, operation and maintenance of the new dam, while giving water to Tamil Nadu on the basis of a clear cut agreement. He also informed the media that former Supreme Court Judge K. T. Thomas will represent Kerala on the expert panel constituted by Supreme Court. On 8 March 2010, Tamil Nadu told the Supreme Court that it was not interested in adjudicating the dispute with Kerala before the special \\"empowered\\" committee appointed by the apex court for settling the inter-State issue. However, Supreme Court refused to accept Tamil Nadu's request to scrap the decision to form the empowered committee. The Supreme Court also criticized the Union Government on its reluctance in funding the empowered committee. Setting at rest the controversy over the safety of the 116-year-old Mullaperiyar dam, the Empowered Committee, headed by the former Chief Justice of India A.S. Anand, has said it is \\"structurally and hydrologically safe, and Tamil Nadu can raise the water level from 136 to 142 feet after carrying out certain repairs.\\" In its report submitted to the Supreme Court on 25 April 2012, the committee is understood to have said: \\"The dam is seismically safe.\\" Last year's earth tremors in that region \\"did not have any impact on the Mullaperiyar dam and the Idukki reservoir and there was no danger to the safety of the two dams.\\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3353151.ece Mullaperiyar dam structurally & hydrologically safe: panel In regard to the dam safety issue of Mullaperiyar between the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Hon‚Äôble Supreme court in its order dated 7 May 2014 constituted a 3-member Supervisory Committee under Chairmanship of CWC Officer in the rank of Jt.

Supreme court judgment came on 27 February 2006, allowing Tamil Nadu to raise the level of the dam to after strengthening it. Responding to it, Mullaperiyaru dam was declared an 'endangered' scheduled dam by the Kerala Government under the disputed Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006.The Kerala Irrigation And Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006 . For Tamil Nadu, the Mullaperiyar dam and the diverted Periyaru waters act as a lifeline for Theni, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramnad districts, providing water for irrigation and drinking, and also for generation of power in Lower Periyaru Power Station. Tamil Nadu has insisted on exercising the unfettered colonial rights to control the dam and its waters, based on the 1886 lease agreement. Kerala has pointed out the unfairness in the 1886 lease agreement and has challenged its validity. However, safety concerns posed by the 119-year-old dam to the safety of the people of Kerala in the event of a dam collapse, have been the focus of disputes from 2009 onwards. Kerala's proposal for decommissioning the dam and constructing a new one has been challenged by Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu argues that building a new dam is for gaining unfair tax revenues from developing states, which is a qua within India, to the detriment of the revenue producing states, i.e., a form of wealth distribution. It is a microcosm of the bigger problem that India faces with China, which is building dams on Brahmaputra. Tamil Nadu has insisted on raising the water level in the dam to 142 feet, pointing out crop failures. However, the court has clarified Tamil Nadu is not a riparian state. In the process the farmers of the erstwhile rain shadow areas in Tamil Nadu who had started a thrice yearly cropping pattern had to go back to the bi-annual cropping.\\"The Mullaperiyaru imbroglio. Hard News. April 2006 The Kerala Government maintains that this is not true. During the year 1979‚Äì80 the gross area cultivated in Periyar command area was .

The Tamil Nadu government had increased its withdrawal from the reservoir, with additional facilities to cater to the increased demand from newly irrigated areas. In 2006, the Supreme Court of India by its decision by a three-member division bench, allowed for the storage level to be raised to pending completion of the proposed strengthening measures, provision of other additional vents and implementation of other suggestions. However, the Kerala Government promulgated a new \\"Dam Safety Act\\" against increasing the storage level of the dam, which has been challenged by Tamil Nadu on various grounds. The Supreme Court issued notice to Kerala to respond, however did not stay the operation of the Act even as an interim measure. The Court then advised the States to settle the matter amicably, and adjourned hearing in order to enable them to do so. The Supreme Court of India termed the act as not unconstitutional. Mullaperiyar: apex court issues notice to Government . The Hindu. 9 September 2006. Retrieved 25 November 2011. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court constituted a Constitution bench to hear the case considering its wide ramifications. The Kerala Government states that it does not object to giving water to Tamil Nadu as a shared commodity, their main cause of objection being the dam's safety as it is 116 years old. Increasing the level would add more pressure to be handled by the already leaking dam. They also raised the problematic definition of inter-State river when in its entirety the river goes into the sea within Kerala without passing through any other states. They also raised the complexity of the judgment and disputes that it can raise in other states that have small catchments of other-State rivers and right to claim part of waters. In a 2000 Frontline edition, one author stated thus: > \\"For every argument raised by Tamil Nadu in support of its claims, there is > counter-argument in Kerala that appears equally plausible. Yet, each time > the controversy gets embroiled in extraneous issues, two things stand out: > One is Kerala's refusal to acknowledge the genuine need of the farmers in > the otherwise drought-prone regions of Tamil Nadu for the waters of the > Mullaperiyar; the other is Tamil Nadu's refusal to see that it cannot rely > on or continue to expect more and more from the resources of another State > to satisfy its own requirements to the detriment of the other State. A > solution perhaps lies in acknowledging the two truths, but neither > government can afford the political repercussions of such a confession\\". Tamil Nadu wants the 2006 order of Supreme court be implemented so as to increase the water level to . In May 2014, Supreme Court of India declared Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006 as unconstitutional. The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the law passed by the Kerala Assembly on the Mullaperiyar Dam that said that the water level cannot be increased beyond 136 feet. The court has ruled that Tamil Nadu can increase the water level to 142 feet and constituted a permanent Supervisory Committee consisting of three members one member from the Central Water Commission of The Water Resource Ministry who will act as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee and two other members from the respective states. The Supervisory will also have a Sub Committee under it. The powers and functions of the Supervisory Committee shall be as follows: (i) The Committee shall supervise the restoration of FRL in the Mullaperiyar dam to the elevation of 142 ft. (ii) The Committee shall inspect the dam periodically, more particularly immediately before the monsoon and after the monsoon and keep close watch on its safety and recommend measures which are necessary. Such measures shall be carried out by Tamil Nadu. (iii) The Committee shall be free to take appropriate steps and issue necessary directions to the two States Tamil Nadu and Kerala or any of them if so required for the safety of the Mullaperiyar dam in an emergent situation. Such direction shall be obeyed by all concerned. (iv) The Committee shall permit Tamil Nadu to carry out further precautionary measures that may become necessary upon its periodic inspection of the dam in accordance with the guidelines of the Central Water Commission and Dam Safety Organisation. On 20 February 2015 Kerala Government Withdraws a plea seeking clarification on 5 May 2014 Judgement which the apex court had allowed the raising the water storage level of the dam to 142 feet and go before the three-member Mullaperiyar committee. The apex court had also rejected the plea for giving open court hearing and said there was no reason to interfere with the judgement of its five-judge Constitution Bench. In an application, the Tamil Nadu government said Kerala has defied the Supreme Court's judgments in \\"letter and spirit\\". Without mincing words, it accused the Kerala government of harassment by denying Tamil Nadu officials free entry to carry out routine periodical maintenance and repairs of the dam. The application wants the Supreme Court to direct Kerala government to allow free access to Tamil Nadu officials to the dam and its appurtenant structures to collect data and change the weekly chart in the Mullakodi rainfall station. It said the court should direct Kerala to allow Tamil Nadu to transport the machinery and materials required for carrying out repairs.  Proposal to construct a new dam Kerala enacted the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006 to ensure safety of all 'endangered' dams in the State, listed in the second schedule to the Act. Section 62A of the Act provides for listing in the schedule, \\"details of the dams which are endangered on account of their age, degeneration, degradation, structural or other impediments as are specified\\".\\"Kerala Justifies Enactment of the Act\\", the Hindu, Sept 19, 2006 The second schedule to the Act lists Mullaperiyar (dam) constructed in 1895 and fixes 136 feet as its maximum water level. The Act empowers Kerala Dam Safety Authority (Authority specified in the Act) to oversee safety of dams in the State and sec 62(e) empowers the Authority to direct the custodian (of a dam) \\"to suspend the functioning of any dam, to decommission any dam or restrict the functioning of any dam if public safety or threat to human life or property, so require\\". The Authority can conduct periodical inspection of any dam listed in the schedule. In pursuance of Kerala's dam safety law declaring Mullaiperiyar dam as an endangered dam, in September 2009, the Ministry of Environment and Forests of Government of India granted environmental clearance to Kerala for conducting survey for new dam downstream. \\"The New Indian Express\\", 17 September 2009 Tamil Nadu approached Supreme Court for a stay order against the clearance; however, the plea was rejected. Consequently, the survey was started in October 2009. On 9 September 2009 Govt. of Tamil Nadu stated that there is no need for construction of a new dam by the Kerala Government, as the existing dam after it is strengthened might function like a new dam. In May 2014, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the water level in the dam could be increased to 136 ft. It also struck down an 2006 amendment included in the Kerala Irrigation Water Conservation Act 2003 that deemed certain fixed water level for old dams. Further reading *Krishnan, J. R., and Ray J.

Original line-up The Tony Williams Lifetime was founded in 1969 as a power trio with John McLaughlin on electric guitar, and Larry Young on organ. The band was possibly named for Williams' debut album as a bandleader, Life Time, released on Blue Note in 1965. Its debut album was Emergency!, a double album released on Polydor/PolyGram Records in 1969. It was largely rejected by jazz listeners at the time of its release because of its heavy rock influences, but it is now looked upon as a fusion classic. Jack Bruce joined the group to provide bass and vocals on its second album, Turn it Over, released in 1970. McLaughlin left the group and was replaced by Ted Dunbar on its 1971 album, Ego. This album also featured Ron Carter on bass and cello, Warren Smith and Don Alias on percussion, and Larry Young on organ. Lifetime gigs around this time featured Juini Booth on bass. This lineup's performance in France on August 7, 1971 (venue unknown) was filmed in color and broadcast on the French television program Pop2. Following Larry Young's departure from the band sometime after July 1972, Tony Williams was the only original member remaining. Williams performed in August 1972 with a new short-lived trio called Life Time Experience, featuring bassist Stanley Clarke and violinist Jean Luc-Ponty. Their performance at the Festival de Chateauvallon, Chateauvallon, France, on August 23, 1972, was captured on film in black & white. The fourth and last Lifetime album for Polydor/PolyGram, 1973's The Old Bum's Rush, was recorded in Boston and features entirely new personnel consisting of female vocalist and guitarist Linda/Laura 'Tequila' Logan (Williams' love interest at the time), Webster Lewis on organ & clavinet, David Horowitz on piano, vibes, and ARP synthesizer, and Herb Bushler on bass. Tony Williams' father Tillmon Williams makes a guest appearance on saxophone. Prior to recording, this lineup of the Lifetime, augmented by guitarist Bob Cacciola (or possibly Caccicola) performed material from the album on July 7, 1972 at the Newport Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, in New York. Marking yet another stylistic departure for the Lifetime and reinvention of the band's musical identity, the record is characterized by a predominantly sprightly and upbeat songwriting approach, electronic keyboard-dominated sound, and soul- jazz female vocals. Notably, keyboardist newcomer Webster Lewis turns in an organ performance which sounds remarkably like his predecessor Larry Young aka Khalid Yasin. Recorded by Williams under the dark cloud of knowing that Polydor would not be renewing his contract, the album received poor reviews and the group was effectively dissolved. In 1974, Williams formed a new Lifetime featuring Bum's Rush holdovers Webster Lewis on keyboards and Linda/Laura 'Tequila' Logan on vocals, along with former Cream/Lifetime bassist Jack Bruce and British guitarist Allan Holdsworth. This lineup, sometimes referred to as Wildlife, recorded an album's worth of material at Europa Films Studios in Stockholm, Sweden in October 1974. This recording has never been officially released but circulates as a bootleg. The New Lifetime In spring 1975, Williams put together a quartet he called The New Tony Williams Lifetime featuring bassist Tony Newton, pianist Alan Pasqua, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth. Prior to settling on Tony Newton as the choice for bass player, a number of bassists auditioned for the spot including Jaco Pastorius. This lineup recorded two albums for Columbia/CBS Records, Believe It in 1975 and Million Dollar Legs in 1976. These albums were reissued on one CD in 1992 as Lifetime: The Collection. After recording Million Dollar Legs, guitarist Allan Holdsworth departed and was replaced by Marlon Graves for the subsequent tour undertaken to support the album. In 1977, Williams parted ways with Graves, Pasqua, and Newton and formed another Lifetime lineup with entirely new personnel consisting of Mike Hoffmann (lead guitar), Gerry Mule‚Ä≤ (second guitar), Paul Potyen (keyboards), and Michael Formanek (bass). This lineup recorded demos for the Columbia label but had no official releases and played a small number of live gigs performing material from Ego and the two New Lifetime albums Believe It and Million Dollar Legs. In July 1978 Williams toured Japan with Ronnie Montrose (guitar), Brian Auger (keyboards), Mario Cipollina (bass) and special guest Billy Cobham also on drums for a series of concerts. They were billed as the Tony Williams All Stars. Later that year he released The Joy of Flying, an eclectic solo album featuring a mix of styles and collaborations with Herbie Hancock, Cecil Taylor, Tom Scott, Stanley Clarke, Michael Brecker, George Benson, and Jan Hammer. It also contains \\"Open Fire\\" recorded by the All Stars earlier that year. In 1979, Williams formed another all-new Lifetime featuring Tod Carver (guitar), Bunny Brunel (bass), Bruce Harris (keyboards), and Tom Grant (keyboards). The band's sound was a major departure from the former New Lifetime's classic fusion, with the high- energy shredding heard on Believe It and Million Dollar Legs largely abandoned in favor of a cerebral and groove-laden approach that emphasized mood and melody over technical virtuosity. As with the 1977 band the 1979-era Lifetime played a small number of live gigs and no studio recordings are known to exist. Toward the end of this period Williams pared-down the lineup to a trio and played some gigs with Tom Grant on keyboards and Bunny Brunel on bass. In late May 1980, Williams and a new trio incarnation of the Lifetime featuring Patrick O'Hearn on bass (miscredited as Patrick O'Hara) and Tom Grant on keyboards recorded the little-known Play or Die album for the Swiss label PS Productions. Stylistically, the recording found Williams returning to high energy keyboard-dominated instrumental fusion reminiscent of the 1975 album On the Mountain by Elvin Jones, Jan Hammer and Gene Perla. At the time of his death Williams was writing and rehearsing with guitarist Lyle Workman (who had appeared on Williams' 1996 solo release Wilderness) to form yet another incarnation of the Lifetime. Legacy and tributes At the time of its release, Emergency! was notably influential on the then-emerging genre of jazz fusion. It was also one of several albums that the members of The Allman Brothers Band listened to regularly early in their career. John Zorn named the Tony Williams Lifetime as a specific musical inspiration in the liner notes of the Naked City album Radio. British singer-songwriter Andy Partridge of XTC calls Emergency! his all-time favourite album, and says that hearing it in 1969, at the insistence of a friend, was a vital moment in expanding his musical tastes beyond conventional guitar pop and rock. Since the death of Williams in 1997, Jack DeJohnette and John Scofield formed Trio Beyond with Larry Goldings in honour of The Tony Williams Lifetime. They released one album, Saudades (2006), on the German label ECM. In 2006, former Lifetime members Allan Holdsworth and Alan Pasqua toured with drummer Chad Wackerman and bassist Jimmy Haslip performing a set comprising original as well as Lifetime material. Live at Yoshi's, a DVD from the U.S. leg of the tour, was released in 2007 and followed by the 2-CD set Blues for Tony in 2009. In December 2008, guitarist Vernon Reid, organist John Medeski, drummer Cindy Blackman, and former Lifetime member Jack Bruce played a week of shows in Japan as the Tony Williams Lifetime Tribute Band, playing a set of 1969/70 Lifetime material. This was recorded in high-definition and shown on Japanese TV. The Lifetime Tribute Band featuring Jack Bruce reformed in February 2011 to play a further ten shows in high profile jazz clubs in North America. Unusually the dates have early & evening shows, something most rock musicians stopped doing at the beginning of the 1970s. Reaction to the 2011 U.S. Lifetime shows has been so positive that the band have renamed themselves Spectrum Road, after a track on 1969's first Lifetime album, and post tour are to go into the studio to record a new album for the U.S. jazz record label Palmetto Records.

Tellos is a fantasy comic book series created by Todd Dezago and Mike Wieringo and published by Image Comics. Three issues at the end of the initial run were printed through Gorilla Comics, which was co-founded by Wieringo. After that company folded, the book returned to Image as a series of one-shots. Wieringo died on August 12, 2007, leaving the future of the series in doubt. Plot The series features a young boy named Jarek and his anthropomorphic tiger companion Koj. They encounter the swashbuckling pirate Serra, a fox thief named Rikk, his companion in crime Hawke, Brad the dragon, Tom a turtlish- wizard, and many other mysterious entities. The heroes strive to unravel the mystery behind Jarek's origin and escape the attentions of a mad boy-wizard named Malesur who is seemingly bent on Jarek's destruction. Jarek has a powerful genie at his control, who is limited to defending Jarek only. Jarek tends to throw himself between his friends and danger so the genie is forced into battle. The series features shadow-hopping ninja frogs as enemy cannon fodder. In fact, many of the citizens of this realm are anthropomorphic animals, though there are many others who are full-human, such as Hawke and Serra. About midway through, the series takes a break from Koj and Jarek to focus on Hawke and Rikk in an adventure in a levitating city which is held down by chains. The heroes band together to stop Malesur, the boy-wizard, once and for all. During the latter part of the series, Jarek suffers a severe injury, requiring him to wear an eyepatch for some time. Publication The ongoing series was preceded with the publication of the \\"prologue,\\" \\"prelude\\", and \\"preview\\" one-shots through Image and Dynamic Forces. The original series lasted 10 issues from 1999 to 2000, starting at Image Comics and later moving to Gorilla Comics.Contino, Jennifer M.: Tell Us About Tellos, Sequential Tart vol. III/iss. 5, May 2000 One-shots Three oversized one-shots: Maiden Voyage, The Last Heist, and Sons and Moons, were released in 2001 through Image Comics. Each volume contained several stories written by Dezago and illustrated by various artists, some flashbacks and others taking place after the original series. The world and characters also appeared in an issue of The 10th Muse set during the original series. A 3-issue miniseries, Tales of Tellos, followed in 2004. The Last Heist This one shot focuses on the continuing misadventures of Rikk and how the events of the main series continue to have long-lasting repercussions. The main focus is a magic mirror. Mirrors are rare enough as it is, but this one can keep an image reflected for as long as the user desires. Brad the dragon and a messenger pixie attempt to help out any way they can. In the end, the mirror is sent to Serra, back on her ship and lacking her sea-legs, who uses it in closure of some long- standing emotional issues. The secondary story, which has Dava Hata on creative assistance, features Koj and Brad discussing the concept of 'destiny' and having their own adventures.

'Merrie Melodies short directed by Friz Freleng and Hawley Pratt. The short was released on February 27, 1965, and stars Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester the Cat, with Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner along for the race. This cartoon was the only Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon to be directed by either Freleng or Pratt, who specialized in Speedy and Sylvester cartoons. This is the only Speedy Gonzales short to feature Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, and the final time Speedy appears with Sylvester the Cat. Plot synopsis Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all Mexico, races against the Road Runner, the Texas road burner. During the race, Sylvester the Cat and Wile E. Coyote join forces in an attempt to catch their speedy nemeses, with predictable results. Often they mistakenly end up injuring each other in comical fashion. 1\\\\. As the race starts, Wile E. chases after Road Runner, only to run into a cloud of dust and fall off the cliff. Sylvester tries the same thing, only to find Speedy on the other side of the cliff, before Road Runner scares him off the cliff. 2\\\\. As the racers are coming, Wile E. and Sylvester catapult rocks to flatten them, but this backfires when the rocks crash into each other and land on Sylvester and Wile E. instead. 3\\\\. The duo then places iron pellets under bird seed and leaves slices of cheese; while the racers eat, the two attach a grenade to a roller skate with a magnet, but only the magnet part of the roller skate leaves and when Wile E. checks it, the grenade blows up in his face. 4\\\\. Wile E. rolls a flat rock to flatten the racers, but the rock does not move - it stays on the edge of the cliff. Wile E. attempts to make it drop, but it still does not move. Sylvester comes to help and they both jump up and down on it, then the rock finally drops the two of them off the cliff. 5\\\\. The duo decide to blow up the bridge as the racers are coming, but as Wile E. is placing the dynamite it explodes. 6\\\\. Finally, they use a rocket car to chase Speedy Gonzales and the Road Runner, but they zoom past them and finish first to win the race, however, nobody gets the trophy. They then fly into the air and the rocket car explodes into a firework as the end card fades in. They might have tied this year, but next year will be another story!

Saudades is a Portuguese word meaning sadness or longing for times past, or in a musical context, blues. Reception The AllMusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4¬Ω stars, stating, \\"Jack DeJohnette initiated a project to pay tribute to the late Tony Williams' Lifetime... The results on this double-disc album, Saudades, are explosive, dynamic, and utterly compelling... This is one of the finer moments in recent ECM history, and a fitting tribute to Williams and his contribution to a music that sharply divided \\"purists' (who still are a pain in the ass in trying to preserve jazz as a museum piece), and those more progressive thinking fans who were -- and are still -- looking for a music that could breathe, engage the culture, and continue to grow\\".Jurek, Thom Allmusic Review accessed August 18, 2011 A JazzTimes reviewer selected it in 2012 as one of DeJohnette's key albums, and wrote that it \\"might be his most incendiary showcase of sheer drumming prowess\\".

The band takes this number at around 180 bpm. The head is played twice. John Scofield then plays a guitar solo for 13 choruses, 156 bars. Larry Goldings takes a solo which lasts for 10 choruses. The group then exchange solos for one chorus each, in the following sequence: Scofield, DeJohnette, Goldings, DeJohnette, Scofield, DeJohnette. The exchange of solos continues, then with each player taking just four bars. The sequence is essentially the same (guitar and organ solos alternating, interspersed with drums) but starts with the organ instead of guitar. This 16-bar long pattern repeats three times (48 bars), which of course equates to four choruses. The song is ended with two more repeats of the head. Total song length: 444 bars, at 180 bmp should be 9 mins 52 seconds long. Extra time due to audience and slight (only by 1 or 2 bpm) slowing of tempo. \\"As One\\" \\"As One\\" has a much freer structure. Larry Goldings is credited with its creation, though one suspects this is a largely spontaneous composition. The first two minutes of the song are an organ solo, in which the mood of the whole song is dictated. Drums and Guitar then join in the fun, but the style remains free. The song grows in intensity to the end, where it leads cleverly into \\"Allah Be Praised\\" \\"Allah Be Praised\\" This number is a Larry Young (organist in The Tony Williams Lifetime trio) composition. The song is another 12 bar blues, but in this rendition, the second repeat of the head is largely free of regular pulse. At only 43 seconds long, this track is really employed as a lead-in to the next, and title, track, \\"Saudades\\". \\"Saudades\\" This track, the second song over 10 minutes on this album (10 mins 46 secs), is an extremely funky number - taken at about 82 beats per minute. The song largely features John Scofield playing funky effects and runs on his guitar. The effects added by Goldings add further to the incredible energy of this song. After about 7 minutes of Scofield's effects, Goldings takes over and plays around with some inventive and witty digital samplings. Goldings plays a brilliant bassline on the organ to accompany his adventures. \\"Pee Wee\\" At the start of this song, Jack DeJohnette says that this Tony Williams composition is taken from the 1965 Miles Davis album E.S.P.. This is, in fact, not correct; the song is taken from Sorcerer (1967). The song starts with a -minute solo guitar introduction before drums and organ join in. Goldings takes an organ solo after the opening guitar section, which is then followed by another guitar solo (this time more structured) from Scofield.

The world's first ABC flight was operated on 2 April 1973, by Laker Airways between Manchester and Toronto carrying 250 passengers on one of the airline's newly acquired McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebodied jet aircraft. Background The introduction of ABC flights was an attempt by the airline industry and the aviation authorities in Europe and North America, mainly the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, to replace the complicated and unworkable \\"affinity group\\" charter rules with a more rational set of rules that was easier to implement as well as less open to potential abuse. In the late 1960s an obscure rule crafted by IATA concerning the permissibility of chartering aircraft to operate flights across the North Atlantic for the sole purpose of carrying so-called \\"affinity groups\\" at fares below IATA's officially agreed minimum fare for any given route by the organisation's member airlines through their wholly owned, non-IATA subsidiaries (such as BEA Airtours or BOAC Charters for instance), came to the attention of a determined group of mainly non-IATA airlines, which sought to exploit these legal loopholes for themselves. This group of airlines included many former leading independent British airlines, such as Britannia Airways, British United Airways, Caledonian Airways, Dan-Air and Laker Airways. Some of these wholly privately owned, independent airlines, notably British United Airways, were IATA members themselves. However, at the time IATA was dominated by majority or wholly state-owned \\"flag carriers\\", which used that organisation to frame rules that were designed to protect them from what they considered excessive and unwarranted competition by independent airlines. The relevant rule stipulated that transatlantic charter flights were permissible provided that the only reason to transport a group of passengers who wanted to travel together on the same aircraft was those passengers' shared interest and that all of them were members of the same club, rather than carrying a group of \\"unconnected\\" individuals on a specially chartered aircraft whose sole purpose of travelling together on that aircraft was to avail themselves of a cheap flight. That rule furthermore stipulated that anyone who wanted to purchase a ticket for an \\"affinity group\\" charter flight needed to book at least three months in advance of the date of travel and be a bona fide, member of an officially recognised organisation. Although some of these \\"affinity groups\\" were genuine, an overwhelming majority of these \\"common interest associations\\" was fake. The sole purpose of their existence was to sign up as many members as were needed to profitably fill a contemporary long-haul jetliner, usually a Boeing 707, for a transatlantic charter flight by issuing each prospective passenger with a back-dated, bogus membership card of a non-existent organisation, sometimes on the day of departure. In some cases, this was done in the offices of \\"specialist\\" travel agencies that had suddenly sprung up on both sides of the Atlantic to cash in on the new \\"cheap flights bonanza\\". These travel agents unscrupulously sold thousands of tickets to people falsely representing themselves to the aviation authorities in Britain, the US and Canada as members of an ever-greater variety of imaginary \\"affinity groups\\". As soon as this scam had come to the relevant authorities' attention, they began policing the departure areas of the main departure and arrival airports on both sides of the Atlantic with the aim of catching bogus \\"affinity group\\" members and preventing them from boarding their flights. Gatwick's departure lounge used to be one of the most prominent places where these unannounced raids were conducted with increasing regularity. As a result of these actions an increasing number of passengers hoping to board a cheap \\"affinity group\\" charter was denied boarding their aircraft. Some flights were said to have departed without a single passenger on board. There were also reports about raids the authorities conducted on a particular airline/charterer only after having been tipped off by an IATA member or by a fellow independent competitor. In addition, the authorities fined the airlines operating these flights for each bogus passenger whose name appeared on the passenger list of an \\"affinity group\\" charter. In some cases these fines amounted to several thousand pounds sterling/US dollars/Canadian dollars. ABC flight rules In the end, the authorities as well as the industry admitted that the absurd \\"affinity group\\" system worked to nobody's satisfaction. They also admitted that the real purpose of travel of an overwhelming majority of those who were travelling under the old \\"affinity group\\" rules was to avail themselves of a cheap flight. It was therefore decided to scrap the entire system and to replace it with a new system that recognised as well as legalised the growing demand for cheap transatlantic air travel at fares below the official IATA minimum fares. This was also the time Laker Airways was battling the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to gain approval for its revolutionary \\"Skytrain\\" low-fare, \\"no frills\\" transatlantic scheduled service that it intended to operate between London and New York City on a daily basis. The resulting compromise led to the framing of a set of new \\"Advance Booking Charter\\" (ABC) flight rules that did away with all of the onerous rules that had governed \\"affinity group\\" charters other than a four-week advance booking period (subsequently reduced to two weeks). However, the subsequent introduction of Laker Airways' \\"Skytrain\\" operation on key transatlantic routes between the UK and the US as well as the competitive response this triggered from other airlines, including many long-established IATA members, resulted in a growing range of low fares being offered on most scheduled services on a year-round basis. The established IATA carriers were able to afford these low fares by cross-subsidising them with their far more expensive premium (mostly business class) fares. This undermined the long-term economics as well as the popularity of ABC flights to such an extent that these flights ceased to be viable by the mid-1980s. Most of the airlines that were major operators of \\"affinity group\\" charters/ABC flights had in fact already begun abandoning this market with the advent of \\"Skytrain\\" in the late 1970s. At the time British Caledonian, for example, whose predecessor Caledonian Airways had at one time been the dominant \\"affinity group\\" charter carrier across the Atlantic with a market share of 22.5%, decided to pull out of the increasingly unprofitable ABC market altogether to fully concentrate on building up transatlantic scheduled services as part of its effort to increase its worldwide presence as a major scheduled airline.

Theme/style Portrait of Judy Garland by Sueo Serisawa circa 1940 from the VonOhsen Ireland collection 2014 Serisawa's painting genres included Impressionism, Modernism, Regionalism, Expressionism, and Abstraction. He also produced still lifes and portraits. The portrait of Judy Garland is a typical example of the approach of Serisawa's portrait style that evolved during the late 1930s/1940s. His use of colour, light and texture gave an ethereal and quiet quality to his works. Serisawa's style was influenced by European Impressionists such as Renoir, Monet and Degas whose works he admired and studied extensively. Serisawa also was influenced by earlier European masters, including EI Greco, Rembrandt and Velasquez, and these various artistic influences resulted in what became for him a blending of the California Landscape School with Impressionism and his move from almost exclusively landscapes to portraits. The portrait of Garland was one of the last he did before he was forced to leave the West Coast due to the start of WWII. Media He worked in oils and watercolors, also making lithographs. Biography Serisawa was born in Yokohama, Japan on April 10, 1910, the son of artist Yoichi Serisawa. The family emigrated from Japan to Seattle and then to Los Angeles in 1918 where his father continued his artistic career. The young Serisawa, inspired by his father, became involved in the California ArtSusan Landauer, California Impressionists scene perfecting his style within American Impressionism. Early career During his time in California he taught and painted portraits of many Hollywood personalities, including Judy Garland in 1940Piro, Rita, Judy Garland: The Golden Years, as well as still lifes and landscapes. He continued to exhibit, winning many substantial awards, and his increasing international reputation led to private classes for such Hollywood notables as Edward G. Robinson, Claire Trevor and Frances Marion. His first major museum exhibition featuring portraits, still lifes and landscapes was held, ironically, on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked (December 7, 1941), at the Los Angeles County Museum. Sueo Serisawa became known as one of the leading figures in the Los Angeles-based school of Modernism. Associated with the likes of Bentley Schaad, Richard Haines, Millard Sheets, and Francis De Erdely, Sueo Serisawa helped position the West Coast as a fertile and revolutionary art center. An ambitious and talented artist, Serisawa exhibited in national shows and eventually won international recognition and his works are highly sought after.Anderson, Alissa J., Sueo Serisawa (1901-1987) After the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entry into the war, Serisawa, as a Japanese immigrant, became fearful of forced internment on the West Coast. He and his family moved first to Chicago and then to New York City until 1947 when they were able to safely return to Los Angeles. Serisawa studied at Otis Art Institute and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He became a painting instructor himself, teaching at Kahn Art Institute, Scripps College, and the Laguna Beach School of Art. Serisawa spent the rest of his life in California, teaching and painting right up until his death at age 94 in 2004. He is survived by a daughter, a grandson and great grandchildren. Serisawa has influenced artists internationally and his work continues to be exhibited. In 2006 it was featured in \\"California Modernism: The Legacy of Five Exceptional Artists: Mabel Alvarez, Edward Biberman, Boris Deutsch, Francis de Erdely, and Sueo Serisawa\\" at the Spencer Jon Helfen Fine Arts gallery in Beverly Hills. Artistic Focus Serisawa's early works were romantic: still lifes and portraits painted in a style influenced by classic European art. His work up to 1941 had a decidedly Modernist, even Regionalist flair. But history ‚Äì both personal and political ‚Äì intervened, as Serisawa later returned to his Asian roots and began painting in an abstract style influenced by the teachings of Zen philosophy, Oriental culture, and the structure and form offered in his study of calligraphy.

The business commenced operation in November 1979 under the control of Arthur Robinson.  History  The first kits to appear on the market were the New South Wales Government Railways GLX/GLV louvre vans. Advertising for these kits first appeared in issue 109 of Australian Model Railway Magazine (AMRM), July/August 1981. A review by Mr Bob Gallagher is recorded in the September/October issue. The modelling fraternity were informed in AMRM issue 114 May/June 1982 of the imminent release of the NSWGR BCH and the projected release of the BWH variant. The model was eventually reviewed in issue 116 of AMRM. By the end of 1983 the proposed BWH was still not available. Arthur was finding it difficult to manage both his fledgling business and permanent employment which resulted in the sale of the business to Rodney and Cheryl James of Rails North Models. Advertising on page 60 of AMRM issue 118 confirmed the sale and the business was relocated to Grafton in northern New South Wales. Consolidation of AR Kits continued and in the September/October AMRM came news of the next models to be released, these being the NSWGR BDX and CCX set down for October, plus the long-awaited BWH and MLE. A preview of the BDX and CCX appeared in the March/April 1985 issue of AMRM with a review taking place in the following issue. Things were starting to move and in the July/August issue of AMRM the MLE wagon was reviewed. Then came the eventual review of the BWH/FWH wheat hopper albeit a bit late and in the middle of a manufacturing rush. The review took place in September 1985 and with it came the news that AR Kits was about to release a WHX Wheat Hopper and CH Coal Hopper. The following month saw the review of these hoppers along with the first high-quality, injection moulded delrin bogies for the Australian market. The 2CL (XCL) and 2CF (XFA) freight bogies were to be the bench mark for Australian manufactured bogies for years to come. Fitted with high quality brass wheels they gave running qualities previously only seen in overseas manufactured products. During the early 2000s, Al Cutmore from Warwick in southern Queensland bought AR Kits. AR Kits have incorporated some of the lines from Main West Models and introduced all of those items formerly owned by L&C; Kits, The Footplate Models range of DJH Locomotive Kits, LMR Locomotive, railmotor and rollingstock kits and the Flushglaze range of model loco and carriage window inserts produced by South East Finecast exclusively for AR Kits. AR Kits bought Lloyd's Model Railways, and its models are progressively being brought back into the AR Kits range. AR Kits is currently up for sale, and the names \\"Footplate Models\\", \\"Flushglaze\\", and \\"LMR\\" will be eliminated, and will become either Main West Models or AR Kits.

It opened in 1886, and carried tourist traffic for steamers on Loch Tay as well as local business. The directors and the majority of the shareholders were local people, and the little company retained its independence until 1923. When the adjacent main line closed in 1965, the Killin line closed too.  History  Planning & local funding System map of the Killin RailwayOn 1 June 1870, the Callander and Oban Railway opened the first portion of its line. Shortage of cash meant that the original intention of linking Oban to the railway network was to be deferred for now. The line opened from the former Dunblane, Doune and Callander Railway at Callander to a station named Killin, but it was at Glenoglehead, high above the town and three miles (5 km) distant down a steep and rugged track.David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The difficult local terrain prevented any question of the line to Oban passing through Killin, and local people were for the time being happy enough that they had a railway connection of a sort; indeed tourist trade was brought in to the town. The Callander and Oban Railway had in fact been absorbed by the Caledonian Railway but continued to be managed semi-autonomously. The Caledonian was a far larger concern that had money problems, and priorities, elsewhere. Nevertheless, as time went on, extension of the first line to Oban was resumed in stages, and finally completed on 30 June 1880. The people of Killin petitioned the Callander and Oban company for a branch line, but this was refused, and when the Caledonian Railway itself was persuaded to obtain Parliamentary authority to build the branch, the Bill failed in Parliament. In frustration, local people decided to build the railway themselves. The Marquis of Breadalbane was anxious to develop the area, and under his chairmanship the first meeting of the local railway took place on 19 August 1882, in Killin. Making a branch to join the Callander and Oban at its \\"Killin\\" station would involve an impossibly steep gradient, but a line was planned to meet the C&OR; further west and at a lower altitude. Even so, the branch would be four miles (6.4 km) long with a gradient of 1 in 50. It could be built for about ¬£18,000. At the Killin end, the line would be extended to a pier on Loch Tay, serving the steamer excursion traffic on the loch.John Thomas, The Callander and Oban Railway, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, Construction Share subscriptions locally were slow to be taken up at first, but with the help of Breadalbane and others, the money was raised, mostly from small traders locally. As no-one was objecting to the line, a Parliamentary hearing for incorporation was unnecessary, only a Board of Trade certificate being required; this was permitted under the Railway Constructional Facilities Act, 1864. The certificate was received on 8 August 1883, and tenders for the construction had already been invited, and received. Authorised capital was ¬£20,785.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 One of the tenders, at ¬£13,783, was ¬£3,000 cheaper than the next lowest. The directors had misgivings about the competence of this contractor, MacDonald of Skye, but they accepted the tender. There were some considerable bridges in the line, to be built as mass-concrete arch structures. MacDonald needed materials for them; his lack of credit at the bank made difficulties for him in obtaining bulk materials, and progress was very slow. By November 1884 MacDonald was in serious difficulties, unable to pay his men and unable to obtain even feed for the horses on the work. The contract was terminated, and re-allocated to John Best of Glasgow. Much time had been lost and the 1885 summer season was now lost. As the time for actual opening approached, the designation of the stations needed to be decided. A suggestion was Killin Junction, Killin, and Killin Pier. (The Callander and Oban already had a \\"Killin\\" on its line). It was then thought that the Loch ought to be referred to, and the pier station was called Loch Tay.Thomas consistently uses the spelling Lochtay, as does Ross. Quick states that the station was opened as Loch Tay Killin Pier, being renamed Loch Tay in 1895. The 1895 Bradshaw's timetable uses Loch Tay.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 On 8 September 1885 Major Marindin, the Board of Trade inspector, was due to assess the line for passenger operation. However a severe snowstorm dislocated the trains and he was unable to be there. The cloud had a silver lining, for the Callander had a considerable amount of coal to deliver in the Killin area, by road cartage, which could not operate. The Killin Railway could at least get the coal to Killin, and could bring farmers' produce out. The contractor's engine was used. Marindin's re- arranged inspection was successful, and the line had an opening ceremony on 13 March 1886. It opened for public passenger operation on 1 April 1886. The Callander and Oban station named Killin was renamed Glenoglehead.Quick says Glenoglehead Crossing. Services Killin Junction had three platform faces, with the Killin Railway on the northern face of an island platform. It was an exchange station only: passengers could not leave the station except by train. The Caledonian Railway worked the line for 55% of gross receipts. The line worked on the one engine in steam principle. There were eight trains each way daily between Killin Junction and Killin, half of them running to Lochtay station. Killin station had a single platform and no run-round loop; terminating trains propelled their train on to the gradient, and the engine moved to the goods yard. The coaches were then gravitatedThat is, they ran back to the platform under the force of gravity, controlled by the guard using the brake. to the platform and the engine was coupled at the junction end. The Westinghouse brake was used in normal train operation. Loch Tay station had a single platform also, but there was a small engine shed there and goods facilities. Loch Tay was intended solely for connections to steamers. In 1921 the Caledonian Railway acquired the Loch Tay Steamship Company which owned two steamers on the loch; the company was loss-making, and the Caledonian wished to continue the tourist trade over the Callander and Oban line; the Killin Railway obviously benefitted also. On 19 October 1922 the Marquis of Breadalbane died. as the local dignitary he had taken a benevolent interest in the success of the Killin Railway, often funding its shortages of money. It had never paid a dividend in twenty years. Breadalbane's trustees were not well disposed to continue the benevolence. Grouping The Railways Act 1921 compulsorily organised nearly all the railways of Great Britain into four large groups: the process was called \\"the grouping\\" and it was supposed to take effect on 1 January 1923. The C&OR; and the Killin Railway were to be \\"schemed\\" into the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. In fact the technicalities of finalising the accounts of numerous small concerns caused the detail of the process to overrun. Since Breadalbane's demise there were only two directors of the Killin Railway, both local men unacquainted with national railway politics and they were taken by surprise when the new LMS indicated the terms of the takeover. Fearing no evil, they rejected the terms, which were to pay ¬£1 for every ¬£100 Killin Railway. In addition they would shoulder all the company's considerable debts. Persistence paid off, and the LMS gradually raised its offer, eventually reaching ¬£8, which the Killin Railway accepted. The Killin Railway was now a small branch line on the LMS railway. The Loch Tay steamers were discontinued in 1939 and the passenger trains stopped running to Loch Tay station; however the goods siding and the engine shed were there, and they continued to be used. In the 1950s a hydro- electric power generating station was built on the Loch, and the railway and its pier were used for bringing in materials for the construction. Closure With the decline in the usage of local railways after World War II, the goods service on the branch was discontinued on 7 November 1964. The C&OR; line was to be closed completely on 1 November 1965, and the Killin branch with it. In fact there was a serious rockfall on the C&OR; line in Glen Ogle on 27 September 1965, and the line was impassable; clearing the line was unaffordable, and the line never re-opened. The Killin branch closed prematurely on the next day. Topography The stations were: * Killin Junction; on main Callander and Oban line, facing for trains from Oban; * Killin; * Loch Tay; probably known as Loch Tay Killin Pier at first, until 1895. The section between Killin and Loch Tay was closed to passengers on 9 September 1939, and the entire line closed on 28 September 1965. The short line fell at a continuous gradient of 1 in 50 from Killin Junction to Killin; from there to Loch Tay the line was broadly level.  Current uses  Killin station buildings were demolished shortly after closure, and the site is now occupied by a car park and council premises. Loch Tay station building is now a private house. The trackbed now forms part of the Rob Roy Way, a cycle path/walk that connects Drymen with Pitlochry. The path incorporates much of the trackbed of the old Callander and Oban Railway.

He is an ape who wears a jetpack and fights crime. History Sky Ape was created by boyhood friends from different neighborhoods in the Boston, Massachusetts area. Phil Amara and Michael Russo were from East Boston, while Tim McCarney was from West Roxbury. They wanted to do a story about a gorilla with a jetpack that would rather do peoples taxes than fight crime. An artist search began, and eventually ended with Oklahoma-native Richard Jenkins. Jenkins has been the artist and co-creator on the series from the first published page to the last (with guest artists Shannon Gallant and Paul Corrigan helping Jenkins for only one stint). The series was first published by Slave Labor Graphics and publisher Dan Vado. The series lasted four issues under SLG (including a trade paperback edition). After languishing for several months without a publisher, Sky Ape was picked up by Larry Young and AiT/PlanetLar publishing. AiT first re-published the original SLG series is one squarebound collection with a cover design by graphic designer Amy Arendts. Next, in 2001, AiT published a second paperback entitled Sky Ape: Waiting for Crime. In 2003, a third volume called Sky Ape: All the Heroes followed. The creators then became overworked with side projects and parted ways. They rejoined in 2005 for a final saddlestitched one-shot called Sky Ape: King of Girls. Each Sky Ape comic has also included guest art by comic creators such as Alex Maleev, Craig Thompson, Pop Mhan, Mark Martin, Ben Stenbeck, Jack Pollock, Mark Schultz, Guy Davis, and many others.

It was produced by Ducati between 1987 and 1992, when it was succeeded by the Ducati 888. Development The Ducati 851 was the successor to the air-cooled two-valve Ducati 750 F1. Development had lagged with the continued use of two-valve engines, but new investment funded the technological advance that Ducati desperately needed. After buying Ducati, Cagiva invested in the development of another V-twin, but with liquid cooling, and four-valve desmodromic heads. Massimo Bordi had designed a 4V Desmo in 1973 for his thesis at the University of Bologna, and with Cagiva in 1985, saw his updated ideas come into production as the Desmoquattro. Based on the Pantah motor, but with liquid cooling, fuel injection, and desmodromic four valve heads (with an included valve angle of 40¬∞), the 851 made Ducati once again competitive in motorcycle racing. The original Desmo Quattro was an experimental 748 cc four-valve racer (seen at the Bol d'Or in 1986) and used 750 F1 Pantah crankcases. Bordi collaborated with Cosworth to develop the heads, but in the time they had, they were only able to reduce the included valve angle of the desmodromic engine to 40¬∞, while less than 30¬∞ was possible with valve springs. Ducati stuck with the desmodromics. The subsequent 851 road bike had stronger crankcases, while the heads and valves remained the same; designed to fit above the 88 mm bore of a 748 cc version. The 1987 ‚Äì 1988 Ducati 851 Tricolor used the signature steel tube trellis frame, adorned with Marvic wheels, Brembo brakes and Marzocchi suspension. That first release was criticised for its handling, with the 16inch wheels so the wheels were enlarged from a 16-inch to 17-inch wheels. In addition, upgraded Ohlins USD suspension components were fitted front, along with fully floating front Brembo brake rotors. In 1991 the bore was enlarged when Ducati released the SP Series of limited edition race replicas needed to sell the required number of bikes for the street in order to be homologated for racing, thus creating the Ducati 888. In 1992 three Ducati superbike models were available: the 851 Strada (851 cc), the 888 SP4 (888 cc) and the 888 SP4S (888 cc). A notable owner of this motorcycle was triple Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna.https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a2/b5/62/a2b56240a1f321c64b675b1b938abbc6.jpgAyrton Sennahttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Ayrton-Senna Racing * 1986 Marco Lucchinelli - (Pole Position, Misano GP) * 1987 Marco Lucchinelli - (Pole Position, SBK) * 1990 Raymond Roche - SBK (World Champion, SBK) References External links * Ducati 851 at Ducati.com Heritage. * Ducati 851 sbk at Ducati.com Heritage. 851 Category:Sport bikes Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1987 ","title":"Ducati 851"},{"id":"7121544","text":"Edmond Louis Budry (August 30, 1854 ‚Äì November 12, 1932) was a Swiss hymn writer famous for writing the lyrics to the hymn \\"Thine Be the Glory\\" (\\"√Ä toi la gloire\\") to music from Judas Maccabaeus by George Frideric Handel.

Liedtke Jr (September 27, 1924 ‚Äî March 1, 1991) was an American petroleum executive, best known as the co-founder of Pennzoil with his older brother J. Hugh Liedtke. Early life Liedtke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma where his father was an attorney for the Gulf Oil Corporation. During World War II, he and his brother, Hugh, served in the South Pacific as junior officers in the United States Navy. They met on Saipan and agree to pursue a business career together if they survived the war. Liedtke earned a B.A. from Amherst College in 1945 and an LL.B. from University of Texas School of Law in 1949. He moved to Midland, Texas, then opened a law practice with Hugh in 1949. Oil executive In the 1950s, Hugh and Bill Liedtke had an office next to that of the Bush-Overbey Oil Development Company run by future United States President George H. W. Bush and Bush's neighbor, John Overby. In 1950s, the Liedtke's, Bush, and Overby formed the Zapata Petroleum Corporation. Zapata eventually merged with Pennzoil, and the Liedtkes took over United Gas Pipeline in 1956. Liedtke served as the president of Pennzoil from 1967 to 1977. In 1977, he left Pennzoil to lead the company's spin-off Pogo Producing Company. Previously known as Pennzoil Offshore Gas Operators at its IPO in 1970, Pogo was an exploration and production subsidiary of Pennzoil set up to look for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. Liedtke served as the chairman, director, CEO and president of Pogo until his retirement in 1991. Politics Liedtke became the Texas finance chairman for Richard Nixon's Presidential campaigns in 1968 and 1972. In September 1972, columnist Jack Anderson obtained a report compiled by the House Banking Committee indicating that Liedtke admitted to investigators that he had raised $100,000 in Mexico for Nixon's campaign fund. Liedtke later served on the Board of Trustees for Amherst College. He also served as finance chair for the Bush-Quayle campaign of 1988 His son, William C.

So important is the Peppin Merino that wool producers throughout Australia often classify their sheep simply as being either Peppin, or non-Peppin. Peppin merino wool is in the 20 to 23 micron range. The Peppin is prevalent in the sheep flocks of Queensland, on the slopes and plains of New South Wales, through the north of Victoria and the mixed farming areas of South Australia and Western Australia. It can also be found in significant numbers in the higher rainfall areas of Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales. History In March 1858, the Peppin brothers, who had emigrated from Old Shute Farm,The Book of Dulverton, Chapter: Houses, Estates and Families, Dulverton & District Civil Society, Tiverton, 2002 Dulverton, Somerset in England, purchased Wanganella Station, near Wanganella township in the Riverina district of New South Wales. The Peppins then selected 200 station-bred ewes that thrived under local conditions and purchased 100 Rambouillet-sired stud ewes from Nicholas Chadwick of Canally, New South Wales. The Peppin brothers mainly used Saxon (a few of the best Victorian rams) and Rambouillet rams, importing four in 1860. One of these, Emperor, cut an 11.4 kg (5.1 kg clean) fleece. They also bought two sons of Old Grimes, a famous plain-bodied Vermont ram, but from then on they bred only from their own sheep. In 1871, Fred Peppin said, > \\"We were satisfied with the type of wool that the country would grow, > instead of endeavoring to produce what the climate and soil continually > fight against. Thus we developed all its good natural tendencies and after > the flock had a character of its own, tried experiments on a small scale > only, and in such a way that they could do no permanent injury, and > abandoned then when they were found not to achieve the desired object.\\" They ran some Lincoln ewes, but their introduction into the flock is undocumented. In 1874, the Peppin brothers, George and Frederick, formed a double stud (recorded ewe and ram pedigree), the foundation stock being selected by T. F. Cumming. They kept careful records of the yields of individual sheep, and breeding was methodically conducted. At the Deniliquin show in July 1878, Peppin & Sons won the society's, Goldsbrough's and the president's prizes for sheep. The next year, Wanganella sheep won first prize for the most valuable fleeces from six ewes at the Sydney International Exhibition. George Peppin died in 1876, and in October 1878, Frederick Peppin sold Wanganella, South Boonoke and Long Plains with 28,168 sheep, 837 stud sheep, 200 cattle, 25 horses and 32,857 acres (132.97 km¬≤) of freehold for ¬£77,000 to Austin & Millear. North Boonoke station with 26,788 sheep, 290 cattle, 63 horses and 31,484 acres (127.41 km¬≤) of freehold land was sold for ¬£67,000 to F. S. Falkiner, Malcolm McKenzie and J. R. Ross in November 1878. Falkiner bought out his partners in 1882, transformed the property and developed a stud with sheep bred from the original Peppin stock. When Franc Falkiner died in 1909, he had amassed in excess of 500,000 acres (2,000 km¬≤) of Riverina grazing land and was running a quarter of a million Boonoke blood sheep. In 1895, Austin and Millear dissolved their partnership, with Austin retaining Wanganella in the west and Millear taking the eastern half, which was renamed Wanganella Estate as was Millear's Merino Stud. In 1910, the Falkiner sons purchased Wanganella Estate and its stud flock. In 1958, the Peppin property was reunited when F S Falkiner & Sons purchased Wanganella from Austin. The two studs created when Frederick Peppin sold Wanganella (Wanganella and Boonoke) continue today along with Boonoke poll started in 1934.

Gameplay  The game is for 2 to 5 players and lasts 3 to 5 hours. Each player plays a mighty hero fighting with monsters and other enemies with weapons and magic and tries to build and strengthen his character. A player wins if he collects at least 4 out of 5 artefacts, which can be obtained by defeating very powerful monsters who guard them. Before a player dares to fight them, he must improve his character in some or all of the following aspects: * Increase his character's strength, which makes him stronger in combat and help him endure more damage. * Increase the will, which helps the character cast more spells and gives more chances when fighting with will - because any combat is done either in strength or in will. Some monsters attack by will and with most other oponnents (including other characters) the player may pay some mages to force them to fight by will. * Collect some gold to buy items (for example a weapon, shield, potion, magical weapon...) or to gain these items by killing monsters etc. * Earn experience points by killing monsters and gain abilities for these points.

They were one of the first bands from Belgium to combine a set of very different musical styles (jazz, rock, improvisation and classical), becoming a starting point for the Belgian indie music scene that developed in the nineties. Biography Initially, X-Legged Sally was formed to compose and perform the music Peter Vermeersch wrote for dance productions, such as Immer das Selbe Gelogen (Always the Same Lies), released as a live cd in 1991. Vermeersch' composing style was becoming too demanding for the constraints of sheet music such as was used in his earlier band Maximalist!. From the beginning, improvisation played an important role in XLS' songs. The first X-Legged Sally concert took place in November 1988. Soon, XLS became a band in its own right, although there would be cooperations with dance ensembles throughout the existence of the group. Based on the international success of Maximalist!, X-Legged Sally had the chance to perform in the New York avant-garde Jazz club Knitting Factory, and a live track was included in the recording Live at the Knitting Factory, vol. 4 (1990). The New York connection proved fruitful, as the two first XLS recordings, Slow-Up (1991) and Killed by Charity (1993) were both produced by Bill Laswell. This also meant international attention and distribution, a rare thing for Belgian bands in the early nineties. The third full album, Eggs and Ashes (1994), contained music written earlier for three different dance productions of Wim Vandekeybus' company Ultima Vez: Immer das Selbe Gelogen (1991), Her body doesn't fit her soul (1993) and Mountains made of barking (1994). This cd is also notorious for featuring the young Mauro Pawlowski on vocals in the waltz Lulu. The music of X-Legged Sally was now slowly evolving into a more 'mature' sound. Larger concepts, melodious tunes and more vocals appeared in the next album, The Land of the Giant Dwarfs (1995). But by now, the musicians were also evolving into different directions, and on April 20, 1996 the band performed their farewell concert at the Cactus Club in Bruges. This concert was recorded by Radio 1 and released as Fired. It was not, however, their last cd, as 1997 saw the release of Bereft of a Blissful Union, once again an accompaniment to a dance production by Wim Vandekeybus from 1996. The members of X-Legged Sally spread out in various musical directions, although mutual cooperations still happen. Peter Vermeersch founded A Group (together with Pierre Vervloesem), and later the Flat Earth Society, Eric Sleichim started Bl!ndman, and Pierre Vervloesem featured in a lot of bands and has a productive solo career.

It has also been considered to be a section in the subgenus Cyathea of the genus Cyathea. Description Species of Alsophila have a treelike growth habit, with an erect trunk that rarely branches, or sometimes a more shrublike habit, with a creeping stem. Their fronds are large, with a strawlike stalk (stipe), dark brown or black in colour. Brown or dark brown scales are present, with distinct margins. The blade (lamina) of the frond is divided one to three times (one- to three- pinnate). The sori (spore-producing structures) are rounded and borne on smaller veins on the lower surface of the frond. An indusium (a covering to the sori) may or may not be present; if present initially, it may be lost as the frond ages. Alsophila is now separated from the other genera in the family Cyatheaceae primarily on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies. The scales on the stalks (petioles) provide a morphological distinction. Alsophila has scales with distinct margins, unlike Sphaeropteris, and with an apical hair or spine (seta), unlike Cyathea. The ornamentation of the spores also distinguishes Alsophila and Cyathea. Taxonomy The genus Alsophila was erected by Robert Brown in 1810. It is placed in the family Cyatheaceae. The division of the family into genera has had a long and controversial history. Three or four clades have been suggested based on molecular phylogenetic studies. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts three genera, placing the Gymnosphaera clade within Alsophila. In 2018, Dong and Zuo proposed the relationship shown in the cladogram below, and provided names in Gymnosphaera for species they considered to belong in this genus. Older sources, such as the New Zealand Organisms Register and Large and Braggins (2004), place Alsophila within a broadly defined Cyathea. Species The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts the genus Alsophila with 275 species. , the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species: *Alsophila abbottii (syn.

Cyathea zakamenensis Distribution and habitat The genus Alsophila is native in tropical and subtropical areas, from North and South America, through Africa, Madagascar and tropical Asia, to eastern Australasia as far south as the subantarctic Auckland Islands. It is found in moist montane forests, on slopes or in ravines, forming part of the lower canopy, middle understorey, or ground layers. Cultivation Alsophila species all require frost-free or virtually frost-free, permanently moist, shaded conditions. Those which have been grown in Europe outside their native habitat include A. australis, A. cunninghamii, A. dealbata, A. leichhardtiana and A. rebeccae. Other species are grown in their native regions. In Australia, A. australis is commonly grown and is a robust species, capable of tolerating some sun if kept in moist soil. A. dregei is a popular garden plant in South Africa, with plants being collected for use from the wild sufficiently often to cause it to become extinct in some areas. Culture The silver fern, Alsophila dealbata has become a widely recognised symbol of New Zealand, although it is not an official national symbol. In the 1971 comedy film A New Leaf, Henrietta Lowell (played by Elaine May) is a botanist whose dream is to classify a new species of fern. On a honeymoon trip, she indeed discovers a new species which she names Alsophila grahami after her new husband Henry Graham (Walter Matthau). She describes the plant as having a vestigial indusium.

The actual ownership of the pipelines is organised through Gassled, owned by the petroleum companies in the North Sea, including Equinor, Petoro, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Norsea Gas, Shell, Total and DONG Energy. Though Gassled has a board, it has no employees or operations. History Gassco was founded by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) on 14 May 2001, and took over the operatorship of all gas transport from the Norwegian continental shelf on 1 January 2002. This activity had previously been carried out by several companies, and the creation of Gassco formed part of an extensive reorganisation of Norway‚Äôs oil and gas sector in 2001. It complied with the requirements stipulated in the European Union‚Äôs gas market directive for organising transport operations in this sector. The political considerations which underpinned the creation of Gassco found expression in proposition no 36 (2000‚Äì01) to the Storting (parliament) and the subsequent recommendation from the Storting‚Äôs standing committee on the environment. These documents specified in part that transport and processing plants must serve all gas producers, and that Gassco must act in a neutral manner towards these. The company was assigned a key role in the further development of the gas transport system, which would contribute to efficient overall utilisation of resources on the NCS. More about Gasscos history. Operator duties Gassco is the operator for the integrated system for transporting gas from the Norwegian continental shelf to other European countries. This role confers overall responsibility for running the infrastructure on behalf of the owners. Frame conditions for the company are determined by the Norwegian government. That also applies to the relationship between Gassco and the owners of the gas transport system. The company exercises its operator responsibility pursuant to the Norwegian Petroleum Activities Act and to agreements with the transport system owners. As operator, Gassco plays several roles. The work it carries out on behalf of the transport system owners is usually designated the normal operatorship. The owners finance most of the major investments in the transport system and recognise this spending in their own accounts. Gassco‚Äôs responsibility for system operation and capacity administration is usually referred to as the special operatorship. Directly authorised by the Petroleum Activities Act, this work is conducted for all users of the Norwegian gas transport system. The cost of operating the transport system is met by its users through tariff payments. The capital element in these tariffs also covers investment made by the owners. Pursuant to the Petroleum Activities Act, Gassco additionally has the right and duty to pursue unified further development of the gas infrastructure. Gassco does not make a profit or a loss from its own operations. Processing plants Gassco operates two Norwegian gas processing plants. The K√•rst√∏ processing plant north of Stavanger plays a key role in the transport and treatment of gas and condensate (light oil) from central parts of the Norwegian continental shelf. This facility separates the rich gas arriving in the Statpipe and √Ösgard Transport pipelines into its various components. It also handles unstabilised condensate piped from the Sleipner area. These flows yield methane, ethane, propane, iso and normal butane, naphtha (natural gasoline) and stabilised condensate. Dry gas ‚Äì methane and some ethane ‚Äì is transported on through Statpipe dry gasand Europipe II, while the natural gas liquids and condensate are exported by ship.K√•rst√∏ ranks as one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of liquefied petroleum gases ‚Äì propane and butanes ‚Äì and this LPG is shipped to customers world-wide. The facility had 638 ship calls in 2006 to load LPG, naphtha and stabilised condensate. Propane is stored in two large artificial rock caverns with a combined capacity of 250 000 m3. Ethane, normal and iso butane, naphtha and stabilised condensate are held in tanks. First gas reached the complex on 25 July 1985 through a pipeline from the Statfjord field in the North Sea, and the first dry gas was piped on to Emden in Germany on 15 October that year. K√•rst√∏ runs primarily on fuel gas. Five of its nine compressors use this energy source, while the remaining four are electrically powered. The gas processing plant at Kollsnes forms part of the Troll Gas development, and became operational on 1 October 1996. The processing capacity at Kollsnes has been increased several times since the facility became operational. Today the daily processing capacity is up to 143 million scm of gas and 69 000 barrels of NGL, piped in from the Troll, Kvitebj√∏rn and Visund fields. The increased capacity at Kollsnes is a result of several considerable investments. In 2004 a new NGL extraction plant started up, in 2005 a new compressor was installed on the Troll A platform and in 2006 a sixth export compressor became operational at Kollsnes. The treatment process at Kollsnes involves separating out the NGL, and compressing the dry gas for export via Statpipe, Zeepipe, Europipe I and Franpipe. The Vestprosess system ties Kollsnes to the oil refinery at Mongstad with a pipeline for NGL. Gas has been delivered from the Troll processing plant to the nearby Kollsnes Industry Park since 1999.

The assassins, Heaven's Militia, led by Joan, locate Nara, who is back with a pregnant Hazy. Joan tells Nara some of her history as a reborn, and her own rebirth occurred when she was burned at the stake, as Joan of Arc. Kidnapped by Bolabogg, one of his henchmen reveals he is Nara's father, and had an affair with Noel's wife so she could give birth to a being suitable for Bolabogg's return. In a fight with the reborn Bolabogg, Nara transforms into a being of light, and banishes him. In the battle, Hazy was killed, but Nara uses her powers to regenerate her, and part of the costs seems to be the cost of her life.

But as his followers work to prepare the way, an unlikely obstacle emerges in the form of seventeen-year-old Asia Black. After miraculously returning to life after a fatal car accident, Asia discovers she‚Äôs not quite herself anymore. But is she the champion of good, or is there something much more to Asia‚Äôs brush with death than meets the eye?

Her primary mission has been the safeguarding of her best friend Hazy who is now the living embodiment of the Key to the Abyss.

He represented the Mukundapuram constituency of Kerala and was a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) political party. Biography Nambadan was born on 13 November 1935 at Perampra, as the son of Nambadan Kuriappan and Plamena. After passing SSLC and TTC, he took to the teaching profession, before he became active in public life. He entered politics in 1957 through Indian National Congress and worked as its local President. He was elected to Kodakara panchayat in 1963. He joined the Kerala Congress the next year when it was formed and became its President, Kodakara Constituency Committee. Nambadan was elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1977, 1980 and 1982 from Kodakara constituency as a Kerala Congress Candidate. On 15 March 1982, Nambadan voted against the K. Karunakaran-led UDF government which was surviving on the casting vote of Assembly Speaker A. C. Jose. This led to the resignation of the Ministry. Nambadan who was one of the founding leaders of the Kerala Congress resigned from the party. Nambadan had in public cut the veins on his hand earlier to sabotage the attempts of some rebel members led by the late E. John Jacob to split the Kerala Congress. In 1987, 1991 and 1996 Nambadan contested from Irinjalakuda constituency as an Independent candidate backed by the LDF. Nambadan served as Transport Minister from 25 January 1980 to 20 October 1981 and as Housing Minister from 2 April 1987 to 17 June 1991, both terms when E. K. Nayanar was the Chief Minister. Nambadan had long fought for the declaration of Malayalam as the official language used in official transactions of the state. He had burnt English copies of legislative bills in the Assembly hall and his supporters had to undergo several days of imprisonment for shouting slogans demanding introduction of Malayalam as official language. A formal declaration to this effect was made by the state government in 2012. In 2004 he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Mukundapuram constituency, defeating Karunakaran's daughter Padmaja Venugopal by a margin of more than a lakh votes. Popularly known as Nambadan Mash (short for master), he was known for his quirky oratorical skills and theatrics which he used unsparingly in attacking rivals. A theatre activist, he had acted in two films. He played the late Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu in Shaji N. Karun's documentary film on Communist leader A. K. Gopalan, titled AKG. Nambadan also authored a few books including the collection Ningalude Swantham Nambadan.

Founded in December 1922, Yunnan University started to enroll in April 1923. It began as a privately run institution called the \\"University of the Eastern Land\\" and its name has changed six times since then. Currently, Yunnan University is one of the \\"Project 211\\" universities in China authorized by the central government to be specially developed. Yunnan University has also been included on the list of the key national universities for the \\"China Western Development\\" program.

History Yunnan University was founded in December 1922 by General Tang Jiyao, the warlord who controlled Yunnan province in the 1920s. The University began to enroll students on April 20, 1923. It started as the privately run \\"Dong Lu University\\" (Dong Lu means \\"Eastern Road\\" or \\"Eastern Land\\"). The name has changed six times in the past 80 years, but the present name dates from 1934. It is known locally as \\"Yunda\\". Following typical abbreviations for Chinese universities, \\"Yun\\" is an abbreviation of \\"Yunnan\\" and \\"da\\" is an abbreviation of daxue, the Chinese word for \\"university\\". Yunnan University became famous during World War II. Since Kunming was not directly involved in the fighting, a great many excellent Chinese scholars, in particular from Beijing and Nanjing, many of these with PhDs from well-known American universities, retreated from the northern war zone. Most of them taught at a newly created National Southwestern Associated University (also called \\"Lianda\\"). Several of them, however, for various reasons, ended up teaching at Yunnan University. There they found a distinct French influence. The president of Yunnan University had a PhD from the Sorbonne. The university is also famous for its French language and civilization research. The present of the school of foreign language is honored as \\"Chevalier des Palmes Acad√©miques(knight of academic golden Palm in 2011. From 1937 through to 1947, the noted mathematician Professor Xiong Qinglai was invited to become the President of Yunnan University, under whose leadership Yunnan University was restructured along the same academic model as Tsinghua University. A cluster of famous scholars, such as Fei Xiaotong, Chu Tunan, Chen Xingshen, Hua Luogen, Yan Jici, Feng Youlan, L√º Shuxiang came to teach at Yunnan University, and thus gradually turned the institution into a general university that had exerted a certain degree of academic influence at home and abroad. In 1946, Yunnan University had five faculties and 18 academic departments, and was included in the Concise Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as one of the fifteen most prestigious universities in China. During the early 1950s, the government began reforming the Chinese education system which had affected every university. Most departments were weeded out, and by 1958, there were only two faculties and six academic departments left in Yunnan University. Again like all other Chinese universities, Yunnan experienced a difficult period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s due to events such as the Cultural Revolution. However, the situation improved remarkably thereafter when the reform era began in the late 1970s.

Technology transfer On April 27, 1998, the Yunnan University Science and Technology Corporation shares were issued on the stock markets in China, and Yunnan University has become the eighth among more than 1,000 higher education institutes in China that own their share-issuing hi-tech companies or corporations. The popularization and application of the major product Yunda-120 growth regulator produced by the Science and Technology Corporation has reached 67 billion square meters in terms of use in cultivated areas. Within a brief period, the corporation, starting from a research group that had only a fund of a little more than 10,000 yuan, has developed into a share-issuing corporation with a total value in excess of 10 billion yuan. Biological Technology Corporation of Yunnan University is the first enterprise in China that owns an independent intellectual property right in the field of the single clone antibody research, and its products of contraceptive test paper, and sterility test paper have been adopted for codifying China's national standards. Publishing house Yunnan University has a publishing house which has produced over two million volumes of various academic works. Yunnan University's academic periodical Ideological Frontier (Social Science Version) has obtained the status of the \\"Kernel National Periodicals\\", and the Academic Journal of Yunnan University (Natural Science Version) has been judged as an excellent academic journal of the key national universities and colleges. Affiliated Schools Yunnan University also has a secondary school, a secondary school of foreign language and a kindergarten affiliated to it. Scientific research Yunnan University has from the very beginning attached great importance to the pursuit of scientific research, closely following international disciplines. It is, for example, a leader in ecology. Its Institute of Ecology and Geobotany has produced nationally utilized texts on plant community classification and plant ecology. (\\"Geobotany\\" is a term from Russian and continental European science which entails classifying and analyzing the geographical distribution of the flora of a province or nation; it is called \\"Phytogeography\\" in English-speaking countries). Fund The Yunnan University Fund is an acting council member of the Fund of Universities and Colleges of China. Through its development Yunnan University Fund has now held nearly seventy Chinese and overseas directors. They have brought many scholars who have promoted the reform, construction and development of Yunnan University. International cooperation In recent years, Yunda has established different levels of exchange relations with more than 50 institutions of higher learning and research organizations in more than twenty countries and regions such as United States, Great Britain, Russia, Japan, Australia, etc. See also *Higher education in China *List of universities in China References External links *Yunnan University - official website (English) *‰∫ëÂçóÂ§ßÂ≠¶ - official website (Chinese) Category:Universities and colleges in Kunming Category:Educational institutions established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in China ","title":"Yunnan University"},{"id":"7121942","text":"Yan Yean was a Steam-era railway station on the Whittlesea line in Yan Yean, Victoria, Australia.Vicsig infrastructure - Yan Yean http://www.vicsig.net/infrastructure/location/Yan-Yean It is now located on private property.Victorian railway stations - Yan Yean http://www.vicrailstations.com/Whittlesea/Yan_Yean/Yan_Yean.html History Yan Yean station operated until the closure of the line after Lalor Station in 1959, after the electrification of the line to Lalor.

In 2000 the army acquired 32 MLRS trucks to let the battalion meet the new millennium and an MLRS Battery of 100 men and 12 trucks was set up. Only five years later; however, the army pulled the plug and stopped buying ammunition. As a consequence, the unit was disbanded and the trucks are now in storage. Forsvarsstudie 07 (Defence Study 07) proposed to reintroduce the system, but it is as yet unknown whether the army will do so.  Organization  The Battalion consists of five batteries and the Battalion HQ: * Battery Nils (Batteri Nils), BttN * Battery Olga (Batteri Olga), BttO * Battery Petter (Batteri Petter/Piraya), BttP * HQ Battery (Stabsbatteriet), Stbtt * STA Battery (Lokaliseringsbatteriet), LokBtt Batteries N, O and P are the gun batteries. Each has 6 M109s available, the number in use differs from contingent to contingent according to the needs of the army and the number of soldiers volunteering for gun duty. Nils and Olga are situated at Setermoen Camp, while Piraja is situated at Rena. The two 'old timer' batteries, Nils and Olga, each have a gun platoon (manning the howitzers), an OP platoon (Observation Post platoon, moving with the unit being supported and acquiring targets) and a command platoon (collects and processes data, issues firing data). The fresh battery Petter only has a gun platoon and a command platoon, but is being set up with an OP platoon. In addition, Nils and Olga has contributions to the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Meymaneh, Afghanistan. HQ battery consists of support and supply personnel. They provide the gun batteries with the resources they need to fight (ammunition, distance, elevation and weather data and security). In addition, they garrison Setermoen camp and serves as guards and medics during exercises. The STA (Surveillance and Target Acquisition) Battery comprises the Artillery observers (Artillerijegere), who moves in forward positions, finding targets for the cannons. On larger exercises, though, the STA Battery is given away to the ISTAR unit. The battalion also has a WLS-platoon (radar), that is used in counter-battery fire. When enemy artillery fires, the WLS radar detects the projectile and uses its trajectory to calculate where it was fired from. This data is then sent to the ILS and the cannon battery staffs, which in turn use this to coordinate the cannons in an effort to take out the enemy battery.  The Batteries  A Norwegian M109 in 2010  Battery Nils  Based at Setermoen, Nils Battery is the oldest battery still in service with the Norwegian Army. It can trace its footsteps back to pre-World War II times. During the late 1990s it was the only gun battery in operation, until the MLRS system was introduced, though at that time it was a great deal bigger than its current size. Since Nils Battery's mascot is a bear, it is called the Army's Slagbj√∏rn (\\"Slagbj√∏rn\\" being the Norwegian designation of a bear that has attacked people or livestock and should thus be considered a danger). After supporting the 2. Bataljon for a few years, Nils battery is now supporting the Norwegian Panserbatalion.  Battery Olga  Olga Battery was created in 1947, as a part of the artillery regiment which served under Tysklandsbrigaden, Norway's force participation in the post-war occupation of Germany. After the occupation it was relocated to Setermoen. It continued to serve until the 1990s, when many units in the Norwegian Armed Forces were disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the end of the threat of full-scale invasion. The battery was reformed on June 21, 2006 and assigned to the Panserbataljonen at Setermoen. After a few years however, the roles were changed and battery Olga is now supporting 2. Bataljon. Its howitzers are named after stars of the Ursa Major constellation. During its stay in Germany, the battery adopted a wild boar piglet that had lost its parents to poachers. The boar was named Corporal Oscar and became the battery's mascot. Because of its \\"rank\\", all privates had to salute it. As it grew up it became uncontrollable and dangerous and had to be put down. When the battery was reformed in 2006, the battery commander, captain Tom Patrick Scarlett, was given a new wild boar piglet as a ceremonial gift. The new piglet was named Corporal Oscar II, inheriting the rank of its predecessor and also enjoying the mandatory salutes of soldiers serving in Olga battery. He is a familiar sight walking mostly free around in Setermoen camp.  Battery Petter  Battery Petter was re-established in 2006 (it also existed in the 70s, 80s and 90s). and is assigned to Telemarkbataljonen at Rena as part of the new Rapid Reaction Force of the Norwegian Army. It is also the only gun battery in the battalion to field exclusively professional soldiers.

Powerful New York politicians and newspaper editors helped shape public opinion toward the war effort and the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. The port of New York, a major entry point for immigrants, served as recruiting grounds for the Army. Irish and Germans participated in the war at a high rate. The city's strong commercial ties to the South, its growing immigrant population, and anger about conscription led to divided sympathies, with some business men favoring the Confederacy and other opinion in favor of the Union. The Draft Riots of 1863, provoked by fears of labor competition and resentment of wealthy men being able to buy their way out of the draft, was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history and featured widespread ethnic Irish violence against blacks in the city. The neighboring and more populous city of Brooklyn in contrast was more pro-war. Early war years Broadway in 1860 New York City had long been the largest, and in many ways, most influential city in the United States. By 1860, its population was a wide variety of diverse cultures, views, opinions, and politics. As Southern states began seceding with the election of Lincoln, New Yorkers in general supported the war effort, but there were several notable early exceptions. The city and the state had strong economic ties to the South; by 1822 half of the city's exports were related to cotton, which also fed the upstate and New England textile mills.\\"King Cotton: Dramatic Growth of the Cotton Trade\\" , New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, New-York Historical Society, accessed May 12, 2012 Mayor Fernando Wood won reelection to a second term, serving from 1860 to 1862. He was one of many New York Democrats who were sympathetic to the Confederacy, called 'Copperheads' by staunch Unionists. In January 1861, Wood suggested to the City Council that New York City secede as the \\"Free City of Tri-Insula,\\" to continue its profitable cotton trade with the Confederacy. Wood's Democratic machine was concerned to maintain the revenues and jobs in the city (which depended on Southern cotton), which also supported the patronage system. Politically, the city was dominated by Democrats, many of whom were under the control of a political machine known as Tammany Hall. Led by William \\"Boss\\" Tweed, the Democrats were elected to numerous offices in New York City, and to the state legislature and judges' seats, often through illegal means. From 1860 to 1870, Tweed controlled most Democratic nominations in the city, while Republicans tended to dominate upstate New York. Lincoln supporters formed the Union League to support the war effort and the president's policies. A series of U.S. Army forts, most constructed prior to the war, housed garrisons of Union troops to protect New York Harbor and the city from possible Confederate attack, but none occurred. Fort Lafayette, Fort Schuyler, and several others eventually were used to hold hundreds of Confederate prisoners of war. The Army established or expanded several large military hospitals, including MacDougall Hospital and De Camp General Hospital, to serve the growing numbers of wounded and ill soldiers. Among the military innovations coming from New York City was the \\"Wig-Wag Signaling\\" system, tested in New York Harbor by Major Albert J. Myer. Riker's Island was used as a military training ground for both white and United States Colored Troops during the Civil War; the latter were authorized in 1863. New soldiers were trained at \\"Camp Astor\\", named for the millionaire John Jacob Astor III, who provided funding for the army. Among the early regiments trained at Camp Astor were the Anderson Zouaves, commanded by Col. John Lafayette Riker, a descendant of the family who had owned the island. The New York Navy Yard, established in 1801 in Brooklyn, was a major facility for the construction and repair of Union Navy ships. By the second year of the Civil War, the Yard had expanded to employ about 6000 men. In addition to government factories, hundreds of small private businesses throughout the New York area--such as the National Arms Company-- provided military accoutrements, supplies, sundries, and items of use and comfort to the soldiers. Military recruitment in New York City Despite pockets of objections to Lincoln's call for volunteers to serve in the Union army shortly after the bombardment of Fort Sumter, New Yorkers in general rushed to join the army or to raise financial and other support for the new troops. In one three-month period in early 1861, the city raised $150,000,000 for the war effort. By the end of May 1861, New York had raised 30,000 men for the volunteer army, including the \\"New York Fire Zouaves\\" (11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment) under a personal friend of Lincoln, Elmer Ellsworth. Troops paraded down Broadway to cheers and shouts as they left for the war. Over the course of the war, the city would send off over 100,000 troops collected from around the state. (based on New York State records, New York City raised over 150,000 volunteers, not including the tens of thousands of militia called up during emergencies during the war. In addition, 30 to 50,000 sailors joined the Navy at New York City.) Beside the Fire Zouaves, other regiments raised in New York City became prominent in the Union army, including the 1st U.S. Sharpshooters (under Col. Hiram Berdan), the 9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Hawkins' Zouaves), and the 10th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (\\"National Guard Zouaves\\"). In 1862, George Opdyke was elected as mayor of New York City, succeeding Fernando Wood. A staunch supporter of Lincoln since before the war, Opdyke worked hard to raise and equip more state troops, and to prevent commercial panics on Wall Street as the Union's war successes waxed and waned. Under his leadership, recruiting efforts were renewed, particularly targeted at the vast supply of immigrants. Draft riots President Lincoln and much of the Republican element of the U.S. Congress, concerned with the numbers of veteran troops whose terms of enlistments had expired and wanting to press the war to a conclusion, had approved of a conscription law to draft soldiers into the army to augment the number of volunteers. \\"Draft Week\\" in New York City was scheduled for mid-July 1863. Because of opposition to the draft, Lincoln sent several regiments of militia and volunteer troops (some fresh off the Gettysburg battlefield) to control the city. The rioters numbered in the thousands, and were predominantly Irish Catholics.Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, (1988) pp. 32-33,\\"The Draft in the Civil War\\", U-S History, Online Highways LLCWilliam Bryk, \\"The Draft Riots, Part II\\" , NY Press, August 2, 2002, Blog post Initially intended to express anger at the draft, which wealthier men could buy substitutes for, the protests quickly degraded into civil disorder against the Republicans and especially against Black Americans. The conditions in the city were such that Maj. Gen. John E. Wool stated on July 16, \\"Martial law ought to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient force to enforce it.\\" Using artillery and fixed bayonets, after the first day the military suppressed the mob, but not before numerous buildings were ransacked or destroyed, including many homes, the Tribune office, an orphanage for blacks, and P.T. Barnum's museum of oddities.  Media and the war  New York City had a number of widely read newspapers and periodicals, whose influence was felt across the country. Horace Greeley, one of the founders of the Republican Party, developed his New York Tribune into America's most influential newspaper from 1840 through 1870. Greeley used it to promote the Whig and Republican parties, as well as anti-slavery and other reform movements. Greeley, who during the secession crisis of 1861 had espoused a hard line against the Confederacy, became a voice for the Radical Republicans during the war, in opposition to Lincoln's moderation. By 1864 he had lost much of his control over the newspaper, but wrote an editorial expressing defeatism regarding Lincoln's chances of reelection. As his editorials were reprinted across the country, his pessimism was widely read. The New York Herald, under owner James Gordon Bennett, Sr., regularly criticized Lincoln's administration and policies, although Bennett and his paper strongly supported the Union. He had endorsed John C. Breckinridge early in the 1860 presidential campaign, then shifted to John Bell. In 1864, Bennett promoted George B. McClellan against Lincoln, but officially endorsed neither candidate. In addition to the powerful newspapers, New York City was the site of the printing presses of several other important periodicals, such as Harper's Weekly, Frank Leslie's Illustrated News, and New York Illustrated News. The political cartoonist Thomas Nast became a well-known commentator on the war, and his efforts helped stir patriotism and fervor for the Union. Field war correspondents and artists such as Alfred Waud provided the public with first-hand accounts from the Northern armies. Two journalists for the Brooklyn Eagle conspired to exploit the financial situation during early part of 1864, a plot known as the Civil War gold hoax. On May 18, two New York City newspapers, the New York World and the New York Journal of Commerce, 400,000 more men into the Union army. Share prices soon fell on the New York Stock Exchange when investors began to buy gold, and its value increased 10%. Officials finally traced the source of the story to the two men from the rival Brooklyn newspaper and arrested them. Thomas W. Knox, a veteran journalist for the New York Herald, published a series of scathing attacks on General William Tecumseh Sherman and his men. These contributed to speculation over Sherman's sanity. Knox printed important information related to the Vicksburg Campaign that led to his being charged, tried, and found guilty of disobedience of orders, although he was acquitted on espionage charges. 1864 Election Day sabotage Secret agents from the Confederacy operated in New York City throughout the war, providing information on troop strengths, political views, shipments, etc. to the government in Richmond. Some of these agents planned an act of terrorism for Election Day in November 1864, to burn down several leading city hotels. The plot was initially foiled due to a double agent who turned over communications to Federal officials, and to a massive military presence that deterred the plotters. Election Day, November 8, passed without incident. But, on November 25, the saboteurs finally struck, setting fires at several hotels and other leading landmarks, including P. T. Barnum's museum, which had been rebuilt following the Draft Riots the year before. The city's firefighters extinguished most of the blazes, and the majority of the conspirators escaped to Canada. However, former Confederate officer Robert Cobb Kennedy was arrested, court-martialed, and hanged at Fort Lafayette in the harbor on 25 March 1865.The Plot To Burn New-York.; Arrest Of Four Conspirators.

Sportivo Barracas on Viejos Estadios website The stadium was first opened to public on May 25, 1920, when Boca Juniors beat Uruguayan Nacional by 2‚Äì1 in the 1919 Tie Cup final (that was played one year later).Cup Tie Competition by Osvaldo Gorgazzi at RSSSF Nevertheless, the stadium was officially inaugurated on June 11, 1920, with a friendly tournament where the local team plus Rosarian clubs Newell's Old Boys and Tiro Federal.Estadio on Sportivo Barracas website Some of the most important football matches were played at Sportivo Barracas, including the 1920 Copa Newton, and the 1921 and 1925 Copa Am√©rica. In April 1923, a roof was added to the official grandstand, on Luzuriaga street side. The field was also used in 1924, when on April 5, Luis √Ångel Firpo defeated Al Reich in the first boxing fight in open space in Argentina.Vuelve el boxeo al club Sportivo Barracas In June and July 1924, English team Plymouth Argyle played three matches in Sportivo Barracas v. the Argentina national teamArgentina national team - List of Other Matches 1901-2008 on RSSSF Ces√°reo Onzari scored the first Olympic goal ever at Sportivo Barracas, 1924 The stadium holds an important anecdotal fact in its history, related to the match that took place between Argentina and Uruguay on October 2, 1924. In June of that year, Uruguay had attained the Olympic football crown at Paris, which at that moment was a kind of unofficial world title, since the World Cup was not played until 1930. The rivalry between Argentina and Uruguay was already an important one, so the match generated much expectancy. After the Uruguayan title, two matches were to be played between Uruguay and Argentina. The first one was in Montevideo and finished 1‚Äì1. The second one in Buenos Aires was to be played on September 28, but there were so many people at the stadium that day that the field itself was occupied by supporters. The Uruguayans asked for the suspension of the match and a perimeter to separate people from players on the next encounter, which was finally played on October 2, 1924. That day, before playing the match, the Uruguayans celebrated their Olympic title by circumvallating the field, something described then as la vuelta de los ol√≠mpicos (the round of the Olympic ones), lately just vuelta ol√≠mpica (Olympic round). Argentina won that match 2‚Äì1 (Onzari 1‚Äì0 at 15‚Äô, Cea 1‚Äì1 at 29‚Äô, and Tarasconi 2‚Äì1 at 53‚Äô), but it was Onzari‚Äôs goal which was to be remembered, because it was converted directly from a corner kick. The International Board had specifically modified the football rules on this point on June 14, 1924, allowing goals to be scored like that. Since then, a goal like Onzari‚Äôs is referred as a Gol ol√≠mpico or Olympic goal in almost all Latin America, and even some parts of Europe. It is the first time that an Olympic goal is called that way, and is also the debut of the expression vuelta ol√≠mpica in Latin America.\\"El gol ol√≠mpico cumple 80\\", Clar√≠n, 2004-10-02 Onzari was at that moment playing for Hurac√°n. For the 1925 Copa Am√©rica, Sportivo Barracas was one of the venues (Boca Juniors was the other host), with three matches played there. In 1926 Spanish team RCD Espanyol (with legendary goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora) played three matches v. local combined and the Argentina national team. The national squad also played Real Madrid at Sportivo Barracas on July 9, 1927. Scottish club Motherwell played in Sportivo Barracas v. an Argentine combined on May 20, 1928. That same year, FC Barcelona was beat by the Argentina national team by 3‚Äì1 in the venue. Italian team Torino was other European club that played at the stadium. At the beginning of the 1930s, the stadium was also used for other sports, such as hurling, rugby union and basketball. The Argentina national team played its last game at Sportivo Barracas on May 15, 1932, when the side beat Uruguay by 2‚Äì0. In 1937, Sportivo Barracas disaffiliated from the Argentine Football Association. The stadium was demolished that year. Previously, the last official game played there was on December 11, 1937, when Sportivo Barracas beat Sportivo Buenos Aires by 4‚Äì3.Sportivo Barracas: un pasado ilustre y un presente feliz by Guillermo Tagliaferri, 29 Oct 2015 References Category:Football venues in Argentina Category:Copa Am√©rica stadiums Category:1920 establishments in Argentina Category:Sports venues in Buenos Aires ","title":"Estadio Sportivo Barracas"},{"id":"7121993","text":"Parque Central can refer to: *Parque Central, Havana, Cuba *Estadio Gran Parque Central, a soccer stadium in Montevideo, Uruguay *Parque Central Complex, centered on twin 56-story towers in Caracas, Venezuela ** Parque Central station, on the Caracas Metro *Parque Central (Honduras), a public park near San Pedro Sula cathedral ","title":"Parque Central"},{"id":"7122007","text":"The municipal election for Timmins, Ontario was held on Monday, November 13, 2006.

Many of the city's neighborhoods have been renamed, redefined and changed since the city's founding in 1896. As such, the exact extents of some neighborhoods can differ from person to person. The following is the list of all the city's major neighborhoods, including any corresponding sub-neighborhoods within them. Coconut Grove is an example of a neighborhood whose size and name has stayed relatively the same since its settlement in 1825. Having been settled originally as \\"Cocoanut Grove\\", its character has stayed almost intact from its early days.Planning Your Vacation in Florida, Miami and Dade County [WPA Guide to Miami], Northport, NY: Bacon, Percy & Daggett, 1941, page 49. In contrast, other neighborhoods have undergone many name and size changes. Buena Vista was once a much larger neighborhood in the 1920s, than it is today. Buena Vista once consumed all of the Miami Design District as well as a large part of Little Haiti, Wynwood and Edgewater. Other neighborhoods, such as the Arts & Entertainment District, were previously branded as \\"Omni\\", after the Omni Mall that was located there in the 1980s and 1990s.

He participated in the Fourth Crusade with his lord, Count Peter of Amiens, and his brother, Aleaumes de Clari, and left a chronicle of the events in Old French.Robert of Clari's account of the Fourth Crusade Robert's account of the crusade is especially valuable because of his status as a lower vassal; most other eyewitness accounts are from the leadership of the crusade, such as nobles like Villehardouin. Robert's descriptions often shed light on some of the crusader activities that are otherwise glossed over by the nobler sources. Brother Aleaumes Robert's brother, Aleaumes, was an armed cleric who distinguished himself during the final siege of Constantinople, when the usurping emperor Alexius V \\"Murzuphlus\\" Ducas was routed by the crusaders. Robert included in his chronicle a brief account of his brother's apparently foolhardy bravery during the final capture of the city, when Aleaumes was the first man within the walls, and later mentioned a dispute concerning the division of spoils which Aleaumes deserved. One of the prominent noble leaders of the crusade, Count Hugh of Saint-Pol, judged in favor of Aleaumes. Shroud of Turin Robert may be one of the few documented witnesses to the Shroud of Turin before 1358. He reports (1203) that the cloth was in Constantinople, in the church of Blachernae: \\"Where there was the Shroud in which our Lord had been wrapped, which every Friday raised itself upright so one could see the figure of our Lord on it.\\"With regard to the whereabouts of the shroud: after the Fourth Crusade, in 1205, the following letter was sent by Theodore Angelos, a nephew of one of three Byzantine Emperors who were deposed during the Fourth Crusade, to Pope Innocent III protesting the attack on the capital. From the document, Codex Chartularium Culisanense, fol. CXXVI (copia), National Library Palermo, dated 1 August 1205: \\"The Venetians partitioned the treasures of gold, silver, and ivory while the French did the same with the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the linen in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before the resurrection. We know that the sacred objects are preserved by their predators in Venice, in France, and in other places, the sacred linen in Athens.\\" But it was shown that the letter of Theodore and other documents contained in the Cartularium are a modern forgery: A. Nicolotti, , in ¬´Giornale di storia¬ª 8 (2012). The historians Madden and Queller describe this part of Robert's account as a mistake: Robert had actually seen or heard of the sudarium, the handkerchief of Saint Veronica (which also purportedly contained the image of Jesus), and confused it with the grave cloth (sindon).Madden, Thomas, and Donald Queller. The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997. Second edition. page 139. As there is no mention of this \\"shroud\\" in any other source, the historian Andrea Nicolotti suggests that Robert‚Äôs account is quite a confused description of the famous miracle that occurred every Friday in the church of Blachernae: the so-called ‚Äúhabitual miracle‚Äù, that consisted in the prodigious elevation of a cloth before an icon of the Virgin.A. Nicolotti, , in ¬´Medioevo greco¬ª 11 (2011), pp. 151-196. The Conquest of Constantinople Clari wrote an account of the Fourth Crusade which follows the Crusade until 1205. Clari, who was a poor knight, provides the view of the rank and file and although he was not privy to the discussions of the leadership he does provide camp rumours and the reality of the combat. Clari viewed the Byzantines as treacherous and had a favourable view of the Venetians. References *Robert de Clari.

It was established in June 2003 to manage Victoria's interest in the OneLink Metcard public transport ticketing system contract, and to procure and manage the new ticketing system for Victoria, eventually known as myki. On 10 February 2010, the Minister for Public Transport replaced Gary Thwaites, chief executive of the Transport Ticketing Authority (TTA), with Bernie Carolan, the then head of Metlink. On 1 January 2013, as the third stage of the implementation of the Public Transport Development Authority Act 2011, Public Transport Victoria assumed the responsibilities of the TTA, which was formally abolished on 1 July 2013. Roll-out of myki Work on a replacement of the Metcard ticketing system commenced in late 2002. Selection of operator The tender for the new ticketing system opened in July 2004 and closed in October. Ten tender offers were received from six bidders, and four bids were short-listed in December. By March 2005, two companies had been short-listed for the final stage of the tender process. They were: * Keane Corporation, with contractors Ascom and Downer Engineering, and * Manta.T, comprising ADI Limited and MTR Corporation, with contractor Thales. On 12 July 2005, the Kamco (Keane) consortium was selected to develop the system. The $494 million contract was due for completion by 2007. Keane Australia was a wholly owned subsidiary of the United States company Keane Inc., and when the myki contract was awarded it described itself as \\"an alliance\\" of Keane Australia, Ascom, ERG, and Giesecke & Devrient Australasia (G&D;), with Keane Australia providing \\"a single point of accountability\\" for TTS. Kamco sub-contracted the installation and repair of myki equipment to ERG, in an A$106 million contract. The tender process was the subject of a number of probity concerns in December 2007, with the Victorian Auditor-General requesting police to investigate a leak of tender documents. Draft reports from the Auditor- General's investigation referred to backdated documents and inconsistent treatment of bidders, but independent reports by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Avanti Consulting in 2005, as well as the Victorian Auditor-General found that the integrity of the tender process had not been compromised. In 2007, serious probity concerns were raised when it was revealed that TTA boss Vivian Miners, who owned shares in the winning bidder, had also become the highest paid bureaucrat, earning A$550,000 a year. Further probity issues were raised when it was revealed the new Myki boss Garry Thwaites was married to the probity auditor for the original tender. Conflict of interest was denied by Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky. Beginning of the roll-out A pilot program was due to begin in early 2007, but was delayed by approximately a year. In the meantime, more than 20,000 pieces of equipment had been installed, with civil engineering works continuing. In February 2008, Public Transport Minister Kosky announced that the full roll-out of the system would not begin until the end of the year. By March the same year, the minister said that the system would not be operational until 2010. In April 2008, TTA announced that it had stopped making service payments to the Kamco consortium after April 2007, because the project had not been delivered on schedule. The first field trial of Myki was held on the Geelong bus network in late 2007. The trial identified problems with 'front office' computer software. In May 2008 Kamco conducted 'Regional Bus Pilot 1' in Geelong, after which it announced that 90% of tests had been passed. According to Kamco's report, Regional Bus Pilot 1 showed that: \\"Essential onbus activities such as scan on and scan off, top up Myki, purchase of short-term tickets using cash or Myki money, driver log on / off, route and shift selection and GPS connectivity and accuracy performed well. Back office processes and operational procedures such as end-to-end data transaction flows, generation of reports, training, communications, installation and commissioning were generally good. The operator (McHarry's Buslines) was pleased with the NTS training, performance and ease of use of the Myki solution.\\" Further field tests across other transport modes were planned during the second half of 2008, including an additional test on regional buses. In August 2008, testing began on the Melbourne suburban train and tram networks. The train tests involved Kamco staff at East Camberwell, Canterbury, Chatham and Mont Albert stations. On trams, special services on route 86, not open to normal fare-paying passengers, were used. These tests were all single mode, with multi-modal trips to be tried at a later date. On 12 December 2008, Myki went on sale to the general public on four bus routes in Geelong,Channel 7 News (12 December 2008 ‚Äì reporter Andrew Lunn) and on 2 March 2009 all bus routes in the Geelong and Bellarine Peninsula area were completely switched to Myki. In April 2009, all bus services in Ballarat, Bendigo and Seymour were converted to Myki. In May 2009 all bus services in the Latrobe Valley towns of Moe, Morwell, Traralgon and Warragul were operating with Myki equipment, making it the last regional bus system to be converted. Melbourne roll-out In May 2009, Myki readers began to be installed on Melbourne trams, and in June 2009, the first Myki vending machines appeared at metropolitan rail stations, with buses following. 17,000 pieces of equipment were to be installed as part of the rollout, with up to 23 pieces being installed per tram, and 2,700 pieces to be installed across the train network's 217 stations. From 29 December 2009, Myki became valid for travel on all metropolitan train services (but not trams and buses), in a politically driven move to meet a promise by Transport Minister Lynne Kosky and Premier John Brumby to have the system working by the end of 2009. The limited rollout was said to be due to reliability problems with the equipment on Melbourne's trams and buses. It was reported that the use of Myki on trams was being halted by signal drop-outs, related to the heavy steel construction of the trams, which was hindering the wireless communications required; and the overhead electrical systems may possibly have had a detrimental effect on performance. The new Transport Minister, Martin Pakula, said that another major problem still affecting trams was \\"canyoning\\", in which trams regularly drop out of remote communication with a central server because of tall city buildings. One source close to the Myki project said the government had considered installing remote devices on tall CBD buildings to improve communications with all devices in the city centre. After the initial launch, tickets could only be purchased online, or from six regional cities where Myki was already in use, further limiting the number of travellers able to use the system. 24 hours after the launch, over 14,000 commuters had registered online for their free Myki. On 25 July 2010, Myki became available for use on Metropolitan and suburban buses and trams. In May 2014, the first Myki electronic gates with the touch screen were implemented. Further roll- out halted In July 2010, then Opposition leader Ted Baillieu had said that the Opposition was \\"considering its legal options\\" with regards to Myki and would look at dropping the system if it won the next Victorian state election. Having won the state election in November 2010, the new Liberal/National coalition government announced on 28 December 2010 that it would halt any further rollout of Myki, including V/Line usage, card top-ups by bus drivers, and the introduction of sales at retail shops, until an independent audit had been completed on the state of the current system. A decision was to be made to either scrap Myki and continue with Metcard, modify the Myki system, scale back the roll-out, or continue the roll-out as initially planned. In June 2011, the government confirmed that Myki would continue operation. However it was announced that short-term tickets would not be introduced in metropolitan Melbourne, and would be abolished on regional city bus systems, where they have been in use since Myki's introduction. With the Myki system to be retained, users have asked that Myki be improved before it becomes the only ticketing system for Melbourne. A survey conducted by the Transport Department found that people like Myki's ease of use, but some complained about the time taken to touch on and off, and the inadequate provision of information about the Myki system. A survey conducted by the RACV found that users like Myki's ease of purchasing, but the time taken to touch on and off was a major disadvantage. The most requested improvement was for more flexibility in the system. Specifically, users want to be able to purchase single-use tickets. Final Melbourne implementation During 2012, the government progressively shut down the Metcard system. * from the start of 2012, yearly Metcards became unavailable. * from 26 March 2012, monthly and weekly Metcards became unavailable. * from 30 June 2012, \\"value\\" Metcards, such as 10x2 hour, 10xEarly Bird, 5xDaily, 5xWeekend Daily, 5xSeniors Daily, 10xCity Saver, Sunday Saver and Off-Peak Daily became unavailable. Only single-use 2 hour, Daily, City Saver and Seniors Daily Metcards continued to be available. All Metcard ticket vending machines on railway stations were removed or switched off. The only Metcard vending machines still in operation were on trams. The limited remaining range of Metcards could only be purchased from staff at premium stations, from bus drivers, and from PTV Hub. On 13 September 2012, Public Transport Victoria and the TTA announced that Myki would become the only ticketing system on public transport from Saturday 29 December 2012. On that date all Metcard equipment remaining on the system became inoperative. In the meantime, the sale of Metcards at premium (staffed) Metro railway stations was progressively phased out, and ceased entirely during October. Metcard validators commenced to be removed from railway stations on 12 November 2012, and all were removed or became inoperative by the end of December. Also from November, passengers with unused Metcards were able to transfer the value onto a Myki card as Myki money at premium Metro railway stations. Regional implementation Myki came into use on regional \\"commuter\\" (short-haul) rail services in mid-2013, in a staged process: between Melbourne and Seymour on 24 June, on the Traralgon line on 8 July, the Bendigo line on 17 July, the Ballarat line on 24 July, and the Geelong-Marshall line on 29 July. Family paper tickets are available to families travelling within the Myki zone with children below 17 years of age. On 10 November 2013, Myki was introduced on Wallan and Kilmore town buses. After February 2014, paper tickets for passengers on commuter services were abolished, and passengers were required to use Myki. Paper tickets remain for travel outside the Myki zone, such as to Warrnambool, Bairnsdale, Swan Hill, Shepparton or Albury. Passengers with Myki Pass who want to travel beyond the Myki area can purchase paper \\"extension tickets\\" to cover the rest of their journey. Retender In July 2016, the Myki contract with the renamed NTT Data (formerly Kamco) was extended for another seven years. The renewed contract is worth A$700 million.

It saw release in Japan on 14 September 2006, followed by its 13 October European launch and 19 October release in Australia. However, the North American release was cancelled. Gameplay The core aspect of the entire Ridge Racer series is drift racing, that is traditional lap racing against opponents with the added twist of intentionally oversteering and sliding the car through sharp corners and turns, known as \\"drifting\\", which earns the player several bonuses during a race. In most respects Ridge Racer 2 can be considered more of an update than a true sequel to the original PSP title - it shares the same game play engine, user interface and game design as the previous title, and includes almost all of the elements, cars, and tracks of its predecessor. Featuring three times as much game play time as its predecessor however, the differences lie in the addition of a total of 42 new racing tracks (of which 21 are unique tracks, with reversed direction counting as separate track), while 18 are taken from previous titles in the Ridge Racer series. Two tracks are from the original Ridge Racer, three tracks are from Ridge Racer Revolution, four tracks are from Rave Racer, eight tracks are from R4: Ridge Racer Type 4, and four tracks are from Rage Racer. Every track from every PlayStation Ridge Racer game released is included as part of this package. Numerous new game play modes are included to supplement the originals of the previous title such as: Duel and Survival modes. As with the previous title, Single Race and Wireless Battle mode is still included, although Single Race was renamed to Arcade. In-game screenshot of a custom race, taking place on the track \\"Shuttleloop Highway\\". The featured car is Kamata Fiera Type-S. The game also features a total of 62 fictional cars (referred to as \\"machines\\" throughout the game) from seven fictional manufacturers (Kamata, Age, Danver, Gnade, Assoluto, Himmel, and Soldat) that are staple throughout the Ridge Racer series. The full complement of cars is available to the player after completing four tours (consisting of 16 races each) of increasing difficulty levels (Basic, Pro, EX and Max) and several various mini-games. In addition to newer cars, Ridge Racer 2 features \\"prizes\\" that are unlocked after the completion of a tour, such as opening movies of previous Ridge Racer titles and E3 demo presentations. The Special Class cars from Ridge Racer (PSP) have been modified for this release and categorised into two tiered categories with four cars each. Special Class 1 denotes cars embodying more traditional supercar designs and appearances, while Special Class 2 is made up of radical or novelty designs that boast the highest top speeds attainable in the game. Specifically, the 'Kamata Angelus' (Special Class 1) is now a more traditional supercar design, similar in appearance to the Angel car from Ridge Racer Revolution, and no longer powered by jet engines. The 'Soldat Crinale' (Special Class 1) appears similar to its previous incarnation; while the Pac-Man car (Special Class 2) now resembles a miniature aircraft in design (with Pac-Man himself depicted as piloting it), and is no longer powered by propellers. The New Rally-X car has been removed entirely and replaced by the 'Danver Hijack' (Special Class 1); a large, super-charged Pickup truck. The 'Yamasa Raggio' (Special Class 2), which appeared in the 2006 Tokyo Auto Salon as a heavily modified Honda NSX, is unique to Ridge Racer 2 and also appears in a \\"prize\\" movie that is unlocked after completion of the game's \\"EX tour\\". The car was later made into a Tomica die-cast toy car for limited release. The three other special class cars are the Age Angelus Kid (Special Class 2), Age Crinale Kid (Special Class 2), and Terrazi Wild Gang (Special Class 1). The game also features a Full Motion Video opening, that shows series mascot Reiko Nagase. Nitrous Notable also is the \\"nitrous boost\\" system from the previous game, which works in the same manner as before. The player has a Nitrous Gauge made up of three nitrous tanks, which at the start of a race are either completely depleted or only partially full. As the player drifts through the corners (especially at very high Slip angles) during the race, their nitrous gauge fills up. When the player fills up one of the three nitrous tanks, it can be activated to achieve a temporary speed boost. The nitrous tanks cannot be recharged while any tank is in use though, but the residual speed increase when the nitrous boost expires can be used just before entering corners to recharge the player's nitrous tanks at a faster rate than normal. (Ultimate Charge) Music All the music tracks from the previous game are also included in this game. In addition, there were some changes in the discs track lists, including new additions Remix Disc 2 and Classic Disc 3. King Records released a music album of the game called Ridge Racers 2: Direct Audio (titled as RIDGE RACERS 2: DIRECT AUDIO). It was released in Japan in October 2006. The track list is below, and all these tracks are new to Ridge Racer 2. Track List # \\"Scream\\" # \\"Departure Lounge 2\\" # \\"Rage Racer Remix\\" # \\"Rotten7 Remix\\" # \\"Kamikaze Remix\\" # \\"Heart of Hearts Remix # \\"Heat Floor Remix\\" # \\"Paris Remix\\" # \\"Pearl Blue Soul\\" # \\"Burning Rubber\\" # \\"Quiet Curves\\" # \\"The Objective\\" # \\"EXH*NOTES\\" # \\"Euphoria\\" [Ridge Racer V] # \\"Mellow Curves\\" Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Whilst Ridge Racer 2 was still praised for the same points as the previous title, reviewers were disappointed that the game is little different from it. The game runs on the same graphical engine and the visuals look almost exactly the same, with the most notable changes being additional courses. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, two eights, and one nine for a total of 32 out of 40.

Early career Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Mansfield was a moppet radio star in Chicago, Illinois. Her father gave her the nickname \\"Sally\\". As a youth she joined the Actors Company of Chicago and the Children's Summer Theatre and studied at the Sherwood Music School. Coming to New York City in 1945, she voiced several radio roles for commercials and on soap operas and dramas. As a chorine with the Don Arden Dancers, she performed in revues in New York and in Las Vegas. Moving to Hollywood, Mansfield met up with a talent scout for Paramount Pictures while she was in the Geller Workshop. She landed a bit part in Forever Female (1953) as the secretary of Paul Douglas. She was a regular on the CBS Gunsmoke radio show in 1954. Mansfield gained notoriety for modeling a sweater designed by Edith Head, which she wore when she entertained U.S. Army troops in Alaska and Japan. The sweater's back was padded with heat-producing chemicals, and this then-novel idea along with Mansfield's photo was widely syndicated. She modeled a two- piece bathing suit in Pose! The Picture Magazine, in March 1955. Television career Mansfield portrayed Connie on Bachelor Father and appeared on many popular TV shows in the 1950s and 1960s, including Death Valley Days, The Donna Reed Show, Hazel and The Andy Griffith Show, and The Phil Silvers Show. She was also an accomplished dancer, performed with the Don Arden Dancers in New York City and Las Vegas, and entertained US troops in Korea. She is perhaps best remembered, however, for her 1954 role as spaceship navigator Vena Ray on the science fiction CBS-TV show Rocky Jones, Space Ranger. She was chosen from 300 who auditioned. Her character anticipated Nichelle Nichols' much more famous role as a female spaceship bridge officer on the 1960s television series Star Trek. The same year Mansfield carried the Miss Emmy torch at the Palladium during the sixth annual Academy of Television Arts & Sciences awards banquet. Executive Producer, Guy V. Thayer Jr., signed Richard Crane and Mansfield to five year contracts for Rocky Jones, Space Ranger. One of the contract stipulations was that the still-single Mansfield would not marry and Crane would not divorce his wife of eight years. Death On January 28, 2001, Mansfield died of lung cancer in Westlake Village, California, at the age of 77.

The financier Tarak Ben Ammar bought the frequencies in collaboration with the satellite channel Eurosport. The frequencies became of property at 51% of the Holland Coordinator and Service, Tarak Ben Ammar's firm, and at 49% of the TF1 Group, principal commercial French TV channel, which also owns Eurosport.

On October 28, 2009, she was elected to lead the Evangelical Church in Germany, a federation of Protestant church bodies in Germany.In the German context, \\"Evangelical\\" corresponds roughly to \\"mainline Protestant\\" rather than to \\"Evangelicalism\\" as that is understood in English-speaking countries. She stepped down from both offices on February 24, 2010 following a drunk- driving incident. After serving as an \\"Reformation Ambassador\\" for the 500th anniversary of Reformation, she retired in 2018. Biography K√§√ümann was born Margot Schulze in Marburg. She passed her Abitur at the Elisabethschule Marburg in 1977 and studied Protestant theology at the universities of T√ºbingen, Edinburgh, G√∂ttingen and Marburg. During her studies, she participated among other things in archaeological excavations in 1978 of several weeks' duration in Akko, Israel. In 1983 she became a \\"Vikarin\\" (German for curate) in Wolfhagen, near Kassel. She also attended the Hotchkiss School on a scholarship by ASSIST. She participated as a youth delegate in the 1983 plenary assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Vancouver, where she became the youngest member of the central committee. Between 1991 and 1998, she was a member of the executive committee of the WCC. After her ministerial ordination in 1985, she became the village pastor of Frielendorf- Spieskappel in the Schwalm-Eder-Kreis, together with her husband, from whom she was divorced in 2007. K√§√ümann earned her Ph.D. under Konrad Raiser, at the Ruhr University Bochum, with a thesis on the topic \\"Poverty and Wealth as an Inquiry into the Unity of the Church\\". In 1990, she was assigned to the Evangelical Church's volunteer service, and from 1992 to 1994, she was director of studies at the Evangelical Academy at Hofgeismar. Between 1994 and 1999, she was General Secretary of the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag (German Protestant Church Congress). In 1999, she was elected bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover; she was the first woman to hold this office. In 2006 she underwent a breast cancer operation. In 2002 she resigned from the WCC Central Committee after the results of a Special Commission on the participation of Orthodox churches in the WCC recommended that the term \\"ecumenical worship\\" be dropped, and that there be much clearer guidelines about what was termed \\"interconfessional common prayer\\".Ecumenical News International, 4 September 2002, ENI Bulletin 16, 11 September 2002 She is currently a member of the central committee of the Conference of European Churches. Margot K√§√ümann currently sits on the Advisor Board for the German Foundation for World Population. In addition, she was involved as an ambassador for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for people with mental handicaps, held in Germany. K√§√ümann is vocal in her objections to the political far right. She argued for a ban on the National Democratic Party of Germany claiming that the church ought not to \\"avert its eyes\\" as it had in 1933. She asked: \\"How can we tell young people that they should not support this party if it is officially permitted?\\" In January 2009, K√§√ümann expressed the opinion that it might be better to tear down former and unused churches than to allow them to be used for purposes that could damage their image. As examples of such purposes, she mentioned conversion into restaurants, discoth√®ques, or mosques. A reassignment to a synagogue, however, she found positive. After protests from Muslims, she slightly qualified her statement, saying: \\"If a Christian congregation is convinced that the use as a mosque can happen in deepest peace, I concur, but at the moment I do not see that possibility.\\"Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, 2009-01-22. Muslime ver√§rgert √ºber Bisch√∂fin Margot K√§√ümann. Retrieved 14 January 2010. In May 2010, K√§√ümann was a keynote speaker at the 2nd Ecumenical Kirchentag (German Evangelical Lutheran Church and Roman Catholic Church Congress) in Munich, Bavaria, where she also led the night prayer at Marienplatz on the final evening of the event.Ohne Angst nach vorn, Evangelisch.DE She will be teaching at Emory University from August - December 2010.K√§√ümann nimmt Auszeit an US-Uni, Spiegel Online As of 1 January 2011, she will be a guest professor at the Ruhr University Bochum where she had earned her PhD in 1989.Margot K√§√ümann wird Professorin in Bochum K√§√ümann has supported, over the years, the Freya von Moltke Foundation in many ways. In 2011 she conducted a speech for Freya von Moltke's 100 birthday celebration in Cologne. She is a pacifist and believes there can be no just wars. Family K√§√ümann has four daughters. She was the first German bishop to file for divorce, in 2007, and on 6 August 2007, it was communicated to the church senate that her divorce was legally valid.Bisch√∂fin K√§√ümann erl√§utert Pastoren ihre Scheidung - Ehemann wird nicht von seiner Kasseler Stelle versetzt The church senate and the leadership of the Church of Hanover supported K√§√ümann and endorsed her continued tenure of the bishop's office, as did the leader of a conservative center.epd: Konservatives Zentrum unterst√ºtzt Bisch√∂fin K√§√ümann Chair of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany She was a member of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany, and on October 28, 2009, she was elected Chair of the Council, the first woman in that position. She received 132 of the 142 votes cast, and said she wanted the church to be more contemporary and hoped to attract more people to it. Her election provoked negative reactions from the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church which declared that it was ready to suspend its dialogue with German Lutherans because of K√§√ümann's non-traditional views and her unusual status as a female Protestant bishop. On 20 February 2010, K√§√ümann was pulled over for driving through a red light on the streets of Hanover. It was determined through a blood test that her blood alcohol level was at 1.54 per mil. (The legal limit is 0.3 per mil in Germany.) Her license was immediately confiscated. She could face the loss of her driver's license for one year and pay a fine of one month's salary. Despite receiving a vote of confidence from the council of the Evangelical Church in Germany, she stepped down from her office as leader of the Evangelical Church and as bishop on 24 February 2010. An attack on the right-wing AfD in the course of a Bible workshop during the Evangelical Church Convention in 2017 in which she stated that the AfD \\"all German\\" policy was implicitly \\"nazi\\" caused widespread comment and controversy.

Published opinions of the Evangelical church Margot K√§√ümann in profile K√§√ümann promotes larger emphasis on Christianity in the Protestant church, compared to past decades; for example, she is concerned by the fact that lessons for confirmation candidates focus more on cults and drugs than on the Bible. She argues for a clearer spiritual profile in church-run facilities, for example, more Bible stories being told in Protestant kindergartens rather than only secular songs being sung. In her opinion, children and adults should pray more, and churches should look like churches and not like noncommittal community centers. She also criticises a number of positions of the Roman Catholic Church. For example, she disagrees with some of the Roman Catholic teachings about homosexuality, artificial contraception, action on reducing the spread of AIDS, ordination of women and celibacy.Der Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/0,1518,503862,00.html Neidisch bin ich nur auf seine roten Schuhe (\\"I'm jealous only of his red shoes\\" - interview with Spiegel magazine 7 September 2007 Published works * Die eucharistische Vision (The Eucharistic Vision).

In November 1976, having lost his place at Brentford, he played five league games on loan at Torquay United. He left Brentford in March 1977, subsequently becoming player-coach at Wokingham Town and putting to use the coaching qualifications he had acquired while a professional player. He was later youth coach at Queens Park Rangers and coached at Farnborough Town. In August 1984 he was appointed manager of Wycombe Wanderers, and guided them to promotion to the Alliance Premier League in his first season in charge, but only because the two teams finishing above them failed the ground grading criteria. Wycombe were relegated the next season, though Bence had already left in January 1986 because of increasing work commitments.  Personal life  Bence entered the brewing industry in 1977.

McDonald. It was published concurrently with the first book in the series, The Deep Blue Good-by. In Nightmare in Pink, McGee is asked by a friend from his military days to help his sister Nina in the investigation of her fianc√©'s death and the large sum of money involved. The book's title is a reference to the inclusion of hallucinogenic drugs as a plot device in the climax. Much of the action takes place in New York City and upstate New York, a departure from McGee's usual haunts in Florida. Plot The book starts with Travis McGee meeting Nina Gibson, sister of Mike Gibson, an old friend of McGee's. Travis described a story of being on leave while Mike stayed behind. When McGee returned, Mike Gibson was severely injured. McGee feels guilty that this happened to Mike when it should have happened to him and he helps Nina out of that guilt. Nina's fianc√©, Howard Plummer, has died and with a fair amount of money. McGee plans to track this down and return it to Nina. The book runs fourteen chapters and does not mention the phrase, \\"Nightmare in Pink,\\" although that phrase refers to McGee's experience on the hallucinatory drugs that he is given while inside a mental institution trying to foil the plot.

Powell was born in London. He was educated at Bedales School, of which his father was co-founder. He served as a signals officer in the Royal Flying Corps in World War I and then became a poultry farmer. In 1930 he began training as a bookbinder at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. After he completed the course he opened his own bindery, then became a partner with Sandy Cockerell in the major bindery of Cockerell & Son in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. He also taught part-time at the Central School until 1943, when he moved to the Royal College of Art, where he taught until his retirement in 1956. There he was succeeded by his best pupil Peter Waters. Powell left Cockerell & Son in 1947 and again set up his own bindery in Froxfield, Hampshire. Here he did some of his most notable work, including the rebinding of the Book of Kells and Book of Durrow in 1953, the Lichfield Gospels in 1962, and work on many other important historical manuscripts.Meehan, 74-76 He studied, but did not alter, the oldest European leather binding to survive, that of the Stonyhurst or St Cuthbert Gospel, and his two chapters on the binding in books edited by Battiscombe (1956) and Brown (1969) remain the most important literature on the subject. He and Peter Waters became partners in the Froxfield firm, working together until Waters emigrated to the United States in 1971. Aided by the design talents of Peter's wife, calligrapher Sheila Waters, this partnership produced some of the most masterful and acclaimed collector designer bindings of the mid-20th century. They worked on the conservation of the many books and manuscripts damaged in the Florence flood of 1966. Powell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1976.

The manga was later compiled in Rumic World books, which are available in English from Viz Media. It was adapted into an anime OVA. In North America, this was released on VHS by Central Park Media under the Rumik World series (which also included OVAs Laughing Target, Maris the Chojo, and Mermaid Forest). Fans of Inuyasha will see a similarity between this one-shot story and the plot of Inuyasha as both feature a Japanese schoolgirl who's magically transported back in time and who meets and falls in love with a rough but lovable boy who becomes her protector during the Japanese \\"Warring States\\" era.  Summary  The main character of the series is Suzuko, a normal Japanese school girl from modern times, but has a strange memory of being trapped in a burning house when she was little. One day, as she is walking home Shuhei, her neighbour's child who has recently had his appendix removed, a huge gas explosion occurs. When Suzuko wakes up, she finds herself in a post-battlefield, in civil war era Japan, with dead bodies all around her. Some men find her in the field, and attempt to rape her. However, a young man named Shukumaru comes to Suzuko's rescue. After Suzuko is saved, Shukumaru takes Suzuko back to his village. He's the village thief/protector. Upon their arrival there, Shukumaru gives his little sister, named Suzu, a bell. He also claims he will marry Suzuko. Shukumaru tells Suzuko that she needs to change her clothes, and at this point, Suzuko comes across Shuhei's shirt. She then realizes that Shuhei must have traveled back in time with her. She tries to find him, but can not locate him. The villagers tease Shukumaru over his not having bedded Suzuko yet, and he is terribly offended. One night, he gets drunk and goes to Suzuko's hut, but all he does is fall asleep. Suzuko soon realizes that she is in fact the little girl in the village named Suzu, and that she was born in Shukumaru's time. She is very worried about this, as she has fallen in love with Shukumaru, and cannot marry him if they are siblings. When the village is burnt, she sees her past self disappear to the future, where she will be adopted and raised as a modern girl. Shortly after this, the leader of the invaders attacks Shukumaru, and Suzuko saves him by disappearing to the future, where she realizes that fire allows her to travel through time, and that is how she survived the house fire she remembers being in when she was little, and how she got to modern times. When back in modern times, Suzuko takes Shukumaru home to take care of his wounds and notices he has a scar on his stomach that is exactly like Shuhei's appendix scar. Suzuko realizes that Shukumaru is Shuhei, and he must have been separated from her in mid-time switch earlier. Shukumaru is Shuhei from the present, and he had been found and raised in the past all along, thus he is not her biological brother. Suzuko doesn't feel guilty about what happened to Shukumaru, however, when he tells her how much he's enjoyed his life in the past. From there, Suzuko and Shukumaru use the same gas explosion that sent them back in the time the first time to travel back to Shukumaru's time again, and the story ends as Shukumaru announces they have a wedding to attend to.

(stylized as thatgamecompany) is an American independent video game development company founded by University of Southern California students Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago in 2006. The company was a developer for Sony Computer Entertainment, contracted to create three downloadable games for the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network service, and has since secured independent funding. The first of their games is a remake of Chen's award- winning Flash title Flow, with enhanced visuals and sound, added multiplayer modes and compatibility with the PlayStation 3's motion-sensitive controller. The title was released on the PlayStation Store in 2007. The company's second PlayStation 3 game, Flower, was released on the PlayStation Store in 2009, and their third game, Journey, was released in March 2012 on the PlayStation Store. Their fourth game, Sky: Children of the Light, was released in July 2019 on iOS and in April 2020 on Android. According to Chen, the company focuses on creating video games that provoke emotional responses from players. He has stated that, while the company is not opposed to making action-oriented games, he believes that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Chen and Thatgamecompany's process is to start by mapping out what the game should make the player feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Chen has stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation. History In late 2005, Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago began thinking about creating their own video game company. The two were in their final year as master's students in the Interactive Media Program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, and had just released a video game‚ÄîCloud‚Äîthat they had developed with several other students. The group intended the project as an experiment, meant to reveal whether they could create a game that \\"expressed something different than video games had in the past\\", and to determine the public's level of interest in video games of that nature. Due to the game's strongly positive reception, Chen and Santiago began to consider founding their own company, so that they could continue making games like Cloud‚Äîin which the design is not based on gameplay mechanics, but on inspiring emotions in players‚Äîafter they left college. At the time, digital distribution was gaining popularity. The two saw it as an opportunity to create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would require them to first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies. Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees. The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game Flow‚Äîa component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming PlayStation Network distribution system and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles. Initially, Thatgamecompany consisted of Chen, Santiago, Nick Clark, who had collaborated with Chen on Flow, and John Edwards. Santiago was the president of the company and the producer for its games, Clark was the designer, and Edwards was the lead engineer. Although Chen cofounded the company, he initially worked at Maxis on the game Spore. The company considered adapting Cloud as their first product for Sony, but instead decided on Flow, as it was \\"more fleshed-out as a design\\". They felt that it would be easier than Cloud to develop while they built the company; no members of the team had experience with managing a business or with creating a commercial game. Several contract workers assisted Thatgamecompany with Flows development, including Austin Wintory, the game's composer. The company had believed that the PlayStation 3 version of Flow could be completed in four months and that it would be ready for the November 2006 launch of the PlayStation Network. However, when it was released in February 2007, it did not include \\"half of the original design\\". According to Santiago, the Sony producer assigned to the team had anticipated that they would underestimate the game's development length, and was not surprised by the delay. The game was well received; it became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and was nominated for the Best Downloadable Game of the Year award at the 2008 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards, and for the Best Innovation award at the 2007 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards. After its release, an expansion pack and a PlayStation Portable version of the game were created by SuperVillain Studios. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond ensuring that they retained the same design and art direction as the original, as they were busy creating their next title, Flower. Flower was Thatgamecompany's \\"first game outside the safety net of academia\\", according to Santiago. Six to nine people were involved at different stages of development. Chen returned to work full-time at the company prior to the game's development and served as the creative director. The game's music was composed by Vincent Diamante, who had worked with Chen and Santiago on Cloud. The game was developed for two years, but the team spent three-fourths of that time in the prototyping stage. After they decided on the game's elements, Flower was produced in only six months. Like Flow, the game was well received when it was released in February 2009, selling in the top ten PlayStation Network titles of the year and garnering several awards. After the release of Flower, Thatgamecompany moved into their own building in Los Angeles. The company's third project is Journey, which was released on March 13, 2012. It was the final game in Thatgamecompany's three- game contract with Sony and was developed by a team of fourteen. This team did not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by Robin Hunicke. The game was in development for three years, despite having been expected to take one year, and the development team faced several problems in expanding the company from seven employees as they began the game to eighteen, and risked running out of money. Upon release, the game achieved both critical and commercial success. It became the fastest-selling game to date on PlayStation Store in North America and Europe. After the game was released, as the company began work on another project, several employees left for other opportunities. Santiago left the company to pursue other ventures, designer Chris Bell left to form his own studio The Willderness, and Hunicke resigned to work at Tiny Speck. Chen attributes the exodus to the end of Thatgamecompany's three-game contract, and to the fact that the company had run out of money to pay employees, mandating an unpaid hiatus until the revenue from Journey came in. Once the money from Journey began to arrive, Thatgamecompany brought back several of the employees affected by the cash flow problems, and some new developers. The company, with its contract with Sony complete, raised $5.5 million in venture capital funding, which they hope to use to develop future games for multiple platforms without influences by publishers. The team has been working since the release of Journey on a new, unannounced game, and as of June 2013 was made up of around 12 people, only half of whom worked on Journey. Thatgamecompany hopes to release the game on \\"as many platforms as possible\\", and to include touch controls in an innovative way in the same way their previous games included tilting the controller. On May 27, 2014 it was reported that the next game from Thatgamecompany had received $7 million in funding from Capital Today and a team of other investors. While the unnamed game has been in development, Thatgamecompany has re-released Flow and Flower onto both the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita, and an updated port of Journey for the PlayStation 4. Sky: Children of the Light, a mobile multiplayer third-person adventure game described as \\"mobile social experience\\", was released on July 18, 2019. In March 2020, Thatgamecompany announced plans to open a second studio in the San Francisco and Silicon Valley area in 2020, tapping into the talent in that region primarily to support Sky. Philosophy When Thatgamecompany designs a game, they begin by deciding on the emotions and feelings they wish to invoke in the player. This differs from the approach of most developers, who build from game mechanics or genre features. According to Santiago, the company creates emotional responses to demonstrate the wide range of possible experiences in video games, which she believes is larger than the few‚Äîexcitement and fear, for example‚Äîthat are typically presented. Chen has said that the company's games are meant to evoke emotions more than a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt that the game promoted green energy. Chen believes that he is \\"too young\\" to make a game with a strong message, and so designs the company's products to avoid overt meanings. Santiago has said that Thatgamecompany's goal is \\"to create games that push the boundaries of videogames as a communicative medium, and to create games that appeal to a wide variety of people\\". She hopes to change the video game industry with this process, so that other companies approach video games as a \\"creative medium\\" instead of a mass product. Thatgamecompany's employees are not opposed to making action titles, and, as a break from their regular projects, have internally created \\"exciting\\" games that were well received by Sony. However, Chen believes that there is no reason for the company to commercially produce such games, as they would not be creating new ideas that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio, as opposed to working for existing game developers. Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make \\"big budget blockbuster games\\", as he believes that the financial pressure would stifle innovation. Games In Flow, the player navigates a series of two-dimensional planes with an aquatic microorganism that evolves by consuming other microorganisms. The game's design is based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2007. Flower was intended as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion-sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure who wakes up in a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each other or not as they wish. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It was released on Windows in 2019. Sky: Children of the Light is Thatgamecompany's latest game, released for iOS on July 18 2019 and on Android on April 7 2020, is intended as a spiritual successor to all of their previous games. In Sky, the player explores a magical kingdom using a cape that gives them the ability to fly. Players play alongside millions of other players, connected via the internet. There are seven unique realms to explore, and each one is themed around a different stage of life. In addition to these realms, there is a Home that serves as a hub between the different realms. Throughout the game, the player will encounter \\"spirits\\" that give the player cosmetic and gameplay-affecting items in return for in-game currency. The player can also find \\"lost stars\\" that let them fly higher. Sky was chosen as Apple's iPhone Game of the Year in 2019, and is planned to release for the Nintendo Switch in 2021.https://thatskygame.com/news/sky-moves-nintendo-switch-release- to-2021 { |+ Games |- !  scope=\\"col\\"Title !  scope=\\"col\\"Year !  scope=\\"col\\"Publisher(s) ! colspan=\\"8\\" scope=\\"col\\"Platform(s) |- ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" PS3 ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" PS4 ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" PSP ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" PS Vita ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" iOS ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Android ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Windows ! style=\\"width:3em; font-size:90%\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Switch |- !scope=\\"row\\" Flow 2006 Sony Interactive Entertainment     |- !scope=\\"row\\" Flower 2009 Sony Interactive Entertainment Annapurna Interactive (iOS and PC)     |- !scope=\\"row\\" Journey 2012 Sony Interactive Entertainment Annapurna Interactive (iOS and PC)     |- !scope=\\"row\\" Sky: Children of the Light 2019 Thatgamecompany     |} References External links * Category:Video game companies of the United States Category:Video game companies based in California Category:Video game development companies Category:Technology companies based in Greater Los Angeles Category:Companies based in Santa Monica, California Category:American companies established in 2006 Category:Video game companies established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in California Category:Privately held companies based in California ","title":"Thatgamecompany"},{"id":"7122204","text":"Vos TV, formerly ESTV, was a Nicaraguan cable TV channel broadcasting from the city of Managua and owned by the national cable TV operator Estesa.

It was part of the Bush administration's War on Terrorism. After the covert action was disclosed, the so-called SWIFT Agreement was negotiated between the United States and the European Union.  Overview  A series of articles published on June 23, 2006, by the New York Times,Lichtblau, Eric and Risen, James. \\"Bank Data Is Sifted by U.S. in Secret to Block Terror\\", New York Times, June 22, 2006.

Accessed June 23, 2006. revealed that the United States government, specifically the Treasury and the CIA, had a program to access the SWIFT transaction database after the September 11th attacks. According to the June 2006 New York Times article, the program helped lead to the capture of an al-Qaeda operative known as Hambali in 2003, believed to be the mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombing, as well as helped identify a Brooklyn man convicted in 2005 for laundering money for an al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan. The Treasury Department and White House responded to the leak the day before it was published, and claimed that the leak damaged counterterrorism activities. They also referred to the program as the \\"Terrorist Finance Tracking Program\\" (\\"TFTP\\"), similar to the Terrorist Surveillance Program in the NSA wiretapping controversy.Blustein, Paul, Gellman, Barton, and Linzer, Dafna. \\"Bank Records Secretly Tapped\\", Washington Post, June 23, 2006. Accessed June 23, 2006. The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program was viewed by the Bush administration as another tool in the \\"Global War on Terrorism\\". The administration contends the program allows additional scrutiny that could prove instrumental in tracking transactions between terrorist cells. Some have raised concerns that this classified program might also be a violation of United States and European financial privacy laws, because individual search warrants to access financial data were not obtained in advance. In response to the claim that the program violates U.S. law, some have noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Miller (1976) has ruled that there is not an expected right to privacy for financial transaction records held by third parties and that \\"the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed\\".U.S. Supreme Court.

Immediately following the disclosure, SWIFT released an official press statement asserting that they did give information to the United States in compliance with Treasury Department subpoenas, but claiming that \\"SWIFT received significant protections and assurances as to the purpose, confidentiality, oversight and control of the limited sets of data produced under the subpoenas\\".\\"Swift Press Release on the Program, Los Angeles Times, June 22, 2006.

Accessed June 27, 2006. Belgian Christian Democratic and Flemish party claimed on June 28, that the actions of the CIA with SWIFT were in breach with Belgian privacy laws. The Belgian parliamentary committee that deals with the workings of the Belgian State Security Service (Comit√© I) reported that SWIFT was indeed in violation with Belgian and European privacy laws. In addition, the New York branch of the Dutch Rabobank is said to deliver information on its European customers to the U.S. government, in contempt of European privacy laws. The Dutch Data Protection Authority claims that Dutch banks could face fines if they hand over data on their customers to the U.S. government. Consequently, the European Union (EU) obtained an agreement that they could send an investigating magistrate as High Representative of the EU to the United States of America in order to monitor the TFTP activities.

The Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program was negotiated during 2009. The treaty was first rejected by the European parliament,Legislative observatory for TFTP Act 1 however after a few months and a visit by U.S. Vice president Joe Biden to the parliament,Remarks of VP Biden to the European Parliament the European Commission introduced a proposal with strengthened safeguards,EuropeanVoice.com: MEPs vote to suspend SWIFT agreement with US, 23 October 2013 which was then adopted.Legislative observatory for TFTP Act 2 Scope The scope of the treaty is to use financial payment messaging data to prevent, investigate, detect, and prosecute conduct pertaining to terrorism or terrorist financing. Terrorism is defined as acts which involves violence or are otherwise dangerous to human life or create a risk of damage to property or infrastructure with the intent to intimidate a population or government or an international institution to act or abstain from acting or to seriously destabilize or destroy fundamental structures of a country or international organization. Process The United States Treasury serves production orders to a designated provider of financial data. SWIFT is the only designated provider today. The request shall identify as clearly as possible the data necessary for the purpose of the treaty. The request should clearly substantiate the necessity of the data, and be tailored as narrowly as possible. Payments within the Single Euro Payments Area are excluded. Safeguards The U.S. Treasury shall process the data only for the purpose of the treaty and data mining is not allowed. The data must be secured and cannot be interconnected with any other database. Access to data shall be limited to investigations of terrorism. All searches must be based upon preexisting information or evidence of connection with terrorism. Information may only be shared with law enforcement, public security, or counterterrorism authorities in the United States or the EU. Citizen's rights Any person has the right to obtain a confirmation through the data protection authority in the EU member state that the person's data protection rights have been respected. Any person has the right to seek the rectification, erasure or blocking of his or her personal data where the data is inaccurate or the processing contravenes the treaty. European TFTP EU may request the aid of the United States to build up a European TFTP. History 2013 *October 23: Following revelations about mass surveillance by the NSA, the European Parliament passes a non-binding resolution calling on the EU Commission to suspend all data transfers according to the TFTP with the United States Treasury Department. 2012 *February 26: Danish newspaper Berlingske reported that U.S. authorities evidently have sufficient control over SWIFT to seize money being transferred between two EU countries (Denmark and Germany), since they have seized around $26,000 which were being transferred from a Danish to a German bank. The money was a payment by a Danish businessman for a batch of Cuban cigars previously imported to Germany by a German supplier. As justification for the seizure, the U.S. Treasury has stated that the Danish businessman has violated the United States embargo against Cuba. 2011 *October 25 **European Data Protection Supervisor communication entitled Terrorist Finance Tracking System (TFTS) - European Commission Communication of 13 July 2011 (2011-0699) to Cecilia Malmstr√∂m, Commissioner for Home Affairs, European Commission: ***We support all the points made by the Article 29 Working Party in its letter of 29 September, based on its specific experience in analysing and monitoring the original agreement between the United States and the EU regarding the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (the ‚ÄúU.S. TFTP agreement‚Äù), which is the source of the developments of the Terrorist Finance Tracking System (‚ÄúTFTS‚Äù) at EU level. ***We would like to complement the observations of the WP29, especially in relation to the context in which the TFTS is envisaged, about [the question of] its necessity and proportionality, the procedural guarantees that should be introduced and finally with regard to its consequences on the existing US TFTP agreement. **European Data Protection Supervisor offers Comments on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 13 July 2011: ‚ÄúA European terrorist finance tracking system: Available options‚Äù: ***[The] main reason for the development of a European terrorist finance tracking system (‚ÄòEU TFTS‚Äô) has its source in the present US TFTP agreement (and in particular its Article 11) and in the Council Decision of 13 July 2010 (‚Äúthe Decision‚Äù). Currently, under TFTP, data are sent in bulk to the US, to be stored and filtered according to requests of the U.S. Treasury Department. This has raised serious criticism, especially by the European Parliament (and obviously the EDPS and WP29), notably with regard to the necessity and proportionality of the 'bulk' data flows. ***If the filtering of data is performed within the EU under TFTS, according to criteria which should be particularly strict (in order to comply with the necessity and proportionality tests), the data sent to the United States would be restricted as a result. This is essential in order to meet the EU data protection requirements, even if the data would not totally meet the (broad) requests of U.S. authorities. *September 29 **Article 29 Working Party letter regarding TFTP 2010 *November 19: **Article 29 Working Party communication entitled EU-US General Agreement (D(2010) 837566) to Vice-President Viviane Reding, Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, European Commission: ***On 26 May 2010 the European Commission presented the draft negotiating mandate for an agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the protection of personal data when transferred and processed for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offences, including terrorism, in the framework of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (hereafter: the EU-US general agreement). The Article 29 Working Party understands the negotiating mandate has been under discussion in both the Council and the European Parliament in recent months and may be adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in early December. The Working Party regrets that it has not been consulted on the content of the negotiating mandate for this agreement, since these negotiations with the US are bound to be one of the most important steps within the area of data protection the EU is to take in the coming years. *July 13: Council Decision **EDPS: In the Decision, the Council agreed to the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and the US while at the same time inviting the Commission to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legal and technical framework for the extraction of data on EU territory. Furthermore, in giving its approval to the conclusion of the agreement on 8 July 2010, the European Parliament explicitly acknowledged the commitment by the Council and the Commission to set up the legal and technical framework allowing for the extraction of data on EU soil. This commitment would in the mid-term ensure the termination of bulk data transfers to the U.S. authorities. The requirement for a prior filtering of data within the EU is supported by the EDPS, as it would prevent the sending of bulk data to a third country. However, the Communication goes beyond the acknowledged purpose of filtering data in the EU, as it clearly indicates that the \\"system should not be set up just to provide relevant information to US authorities\\", as the authorities of the Member States \\"have a real interest in the results of such a system as well\\". The Communication therefore seems to legitimise the setting up of a whole new TFTS scheme, in an EU specific context, on the basis of the existing TFTP agreement. In other words, the Communication seems to justify the introduction of a new system which invades the privacy of EU citizens for the benefit of the authorities of EU Member States while using as a justification the assessment of utility of a system conceived and implemented to allow the US authorities to pursue their own investigation linked to terrorism. The EDPS has strong doubts about this approach, which does not appear to respect the principles of necessity and proportionality (as developed below).

SWIFT is a Belgian based cooperative active in the processing of financial messages. It was revealed that personal data, collected and processed via the SWIFT network for international money transfers using the bank identification code (‚ÄúBIC‚Äù) or ‚ÄúSWIFT‚Äù code, had been provided to the UST since the end of 2001 on the basis of subpoenas under American law for terrorism investigation purposes. - Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 10/2006 on the processing of personal data by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). New York Times' disclosure controversy A number of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives criticized the New York Times for reporting on the program,O‚ÄôConnor, Patrick and Allen, Jonathan. \\"GOP bill targets NY Times \\", The Hill, June 28, 2006.

King, then the House Homeland Security Committee chairman, called on the Bush administration to seek criminal charges against the Times under the Espionage Act of 1917 and other related federal statutes.Devlin Barrett. \\"Lawmaker Wants Times Prosecuted\\", The Washington Post, June 26, 2006.

The Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal divulged information about the TFTP at the same time.Editors. \\"Bush's hypocrisy once again comes into focus\\", The Albuquerque Tribune, June 29, 2006. Accessed June 29, 2006. The New York Times itself argued in a June 28, 2006 editorial that its reporting about the TFTP is protected by the First Amendment and serves a vital role, providing \\"information the public needs to make things right again\\". The New York Times editorial further argued that terrorists would have to be \\"fairly credulous\\" to believe their finances were not being tracked and that the reporting bore \\"no resemblance to security breaches, like disclosure of troop locations, that would clearly compromise the immediate safety of specific individuals.Editors. \\"Patriotism and the Press\\", New York Times, June 28, 2006. Accessed July 3, 2006. Some have also questioned whether the information in the original June 23, 2006 newspaper articles was even secret, despite its U.S. government classification, because of previous newspaper articles discussing SWIFT. Specifically, a 1998 Washington Post article, in the wake of the U.S. embassy bombings, mentioned that the \\"CIA and agents with Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also will try to lay tripwires to find out when bin Laden moves funds by plugging into the computerized systems of bank transaction monitoring services ‚Äì operated by the Federal Reserve and private organizations called SWIFT and CHIPS ‚Äì that record the billions of dollars coursing through the global banking system daily.\\" Also, a September 21, 2001 Baltimore Sun article mentioned SWIFT \\"headquartered in Belgium\\" and conjectured about the ability of the U.S. National Security Agency \\"to follow the money through its electronic intercepts of such transactions\\". Still others have questioned the secrecy of the TFTP because the Bush administration has made public announcements that it planned to track terrorist-related finances. For example, in a speech shortly after the September 11th attacks, George W. Bush elaborated on the Administration's intention to track terrorist funding, saying \\"if [financial institutions] fail to help us by sharing information or freezing accounts, the Department of the Treasury now has the authority to freeze their bank's assets and transactions in the United States\\".President Freezes Terrorists' Assets However, critics of the decision to disclose the classified program's existence, including U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, responded by arguing that there is a vast difference between stating general intentions to track terrorist finances and actually revealing the exact means employed to do so. Some of these critics called attention to the New York Times itself making no mention of either SWIFT or the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program in a November 29, 2005 article ironically detailing the Bush administration's apparent lack of progress in tracking terrorist finances. Moreover, in an editorial on the press's obligations in wartime, the Wall Street Journal clarified the basic differences between its approach to the story and that of the New York Times. As for Secretary Snow, he disagreed with executive editor of The New York Times Bill Keller's claim that terrorists are now exclusively using \\"other means\\"Keller, Bill. \\"Letter From Bill Keller on The Times's Banking Records Report\\" New York Times, June 25, 2006.

Accessed July 23, 2006 On October 22, 2006, Public Editor of The New York Times Byron Calame stated that he did not think the article should have been published, reversing his strong support of the Times in his June 2 column. \\"I haven't found any evidence in the intervening months that the surveillance program was illegal...The lack of appropriate oversight‚Äîto catch any abuses in the absence of media attention‚Äîwas a key reason I originally supported publication. I think, however, that I gave it too much weight\\". In September 2006, however, the Belgian government declared that the SWIFT dealings with U.S. government authorities were, in fact, a breach of Belgian and European privacy laws. New York Times editor Bill Keller responded to Calame‚Äôs ‚Äúrevisionist epiphany‚Äù in a letter published on November 6, 2006. Keller felt that Calame‚Äôs premise that ‚Äúthe press should not reveal sensitive secret information unless there is a preponderance of evidence that the information exposes illegal or abusive actions by the government‚Äù set too high a bar. Keller explained, ‚ÄúThe banking story landed in the context of a national debate about the concentration of executive power. The Swift program was the latest in a series of programs carried out without the customary checks and balances‚Äîin this case, Congressional oversight. Key members of Congress who would normally be apprised of such a program and who would be expected to monitor its safeguards only learned of the program because we did‚Äù.

Much of the architecture of the city is in the Soviet realist style. The current permanent-resident population is largely Russian Ukrainian, with a significant influx of Tatars and Armenians. History Originally an ancient Greek settlement named Parthenium (), the name derived from the word Parthenon. It had been subsequently settled or invaded by, Goths, Turks, Genoese, Tatars, and Germans. It is in wine country; the nearby Massandra winery is famous for its production of Bastardo and other wines. Tourist attraction Partenit has two beaches. One is the public beach which is free. The other is on the property of the military resort and much bigger. Most tourists rent an apartment from a local renter, and the going rate in recent years has been about $20/day for an apartment within a 10-minute walk of the beach. There are several businesses offering excursions, set up for tourists between the bazaar and the beach, to different parts of Crimea, including to Massandra and Livadia, as well as waterfalls.

She survived the war and served in the post-war Marina Militare until 1964. Design Raimondo Montecuccoli, which gives the name to its own sub-class, was part of the third group of Condottieri-class light cruisers. They were larger and better protected than their predecessors. She was built by Ansaldo, Genoa, and was named after Raimondo Montecuccoli, a 17th-century Italian general in Austrian service. Career Raimondo Montecuccoli entered service in 1935 and was sent out to the Far East in 1937 to protect Italian interests in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and returned home in November 1938 after being relieved by . During the war she participated in the Battle of Punta Stilo, on 9 July 1940, and in the successful attack on Harpoon convoy during the Battle of Pantelleria, on 15 June 1942. Raimondo Montecuccoli and the cruiser , forming the 7th Division, fought a long gunnery duel off Pantelleria with the escort of a large Allied convoy to Malta, at the end of which their combined fire crippled the destroyer and damaged the cruiser and the destroyer ; only two ships from the convoy reached Malta, one of them holed by a mine. Partridge took the disabled Bedouin under tow. During the last stages of the action, according to post- battle reports from both sides, Raimondo Montecuccoli scored a hit on the minesweeper at \\"approx. 26.000 yards\\".Da Zara, Appendix 1, p. 38-9 Two Allied freighters from the convoy, the cargo ship Burdwan and the large tanker Kentucky, both of them disabled by previous air attacks and abandoned by their escorts, were finished off by the Italian squadron. Kentucky was shelled and set on fire by Raimondo Monteccucolis guns.Bragadin (1957), p. 184 The Italian cruisers also forced Partridge to cast off the tow and leave Bedouin behind. The disabled destroyer was eventually sunk by an Italian SM 79 torpedo bomber. Richard (2000). Malta Convoys, 1940‚Äì1943, pp. 344-45. London: Jack Murray. . She was heavily damaged by USAAF bombers in Naples on 4 December 1942, with the loss of 44 of her crew, but having been repaired and just weeks before the armistice, on August 1943, she was operative again. The cruiser became by this time one of the few Italian naval units fitted with the Italian designed radar EC-3 ter Gufo radar. On 4 August Raimondo Montecuccoli along with the light cruiser Eugenio di Savoia, shelled without consequences a small Allied convoy off Palermo during the Allied invasion of Sicily, in an aborted attempt to attack the United States Navy fleet in port. The Allied convoy was actually an American submarine chaser, USS SC-530, escorting a freshwater barge. The Italian cruisers withdrew after picking up a number of coastal search radars tracking them with their Metox devices. After the Armistice she sailed to Malta with the majority of the remaining Italian fleet. Joining the Italian Co-Belligerent navy, she acted as a fast transport ship for the rest of the war. She remained with Italy after the war to serve as a training cruiser until 1964. Preservation Some remains of the ship, along with several artillery pieces and armoured vehicles, are preserved at the Citt√† della Domenica theme and amusement park near Perugia, in Italy. There is the forward mast and a dual artillery mount, placed near the mast.

Although the dead pedal serves no function in the car, many cars opt to implement it because it provides a number of benefits to the driver. In manual transmission cars the dead pedal is designed to promote a smoother actuation of the clutch by keeping the drivers foot in the same plane as the pedal.http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a- dead-pedal.htm Automatic transmission cars can also benefit from the dead pedal because it prevents fatigue by offering a stable inclined surface on which the driver can place their foot. Even if a car does not have a dead pedal installed, there are a variety of aftermarket accessories that can be installed.  History  The dead pedal was not a staple component in original design of automobile pedals. Cars such as the original Ford Model T, 1908, did not have dead pedals and had an upright pedal system. The dead pedal was developed to prevent the accidental actuation of the clutch or brake, also known as left-foot braking, by providing an alternative surface to rest the foot on. The dead pedal became more important with time as stronger and faster cars were developed because the left foot must push against the floor to brace the drivers body. Racing cars and civilian cars with manual transmission systems will have the dead pedal. Most auto transmission cars can also have the dead pedal but cars like the Ford Focus 1998 don't have it.  Function  The dead pedal serves two main purposes in cars. * It acts as a foot rest for the left foot, for the comfort of the driver. * In cars with manual transmissions, it helps keep the driver from riding the clutch, a dangerous practice of keeping the clutch partially disengaged while driving. The dead pedal provides an inclined surface for the driver's left foot. This allows the driver to brace when maneuvering without accidentally engaging the brakes. This helps the driver maintain more control over the vehicle.https://web.archive.org/web/20070429201355/http://www.driving- school.com.au/faq.htm#faq6 It also prevents wear on the brake or clutch pedal because even if no additional pressure is put on these pedals, the constant contact and abrasion of the driver's foot will wear away at the surface of pedals. In automatic cars the dead pedal is normally just a rubber step placed on the floor of the car. In racing cars the dead pedal is used to cut down the response time in activating the clutch and is integral to smooth actuation of the clutch. It is typically an actual pedal located to left of the clutch. The dead pedal allows for the racer or driver to keep the left foot on the same plane as the clutch, thus making the transition between them smoother and faster. However, the dead pedal still serves no function to the car itself. There have been attempts to advance the dead pedal technology by making it modular https://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr;=&vid;=USPAT6318786&id;=UToHAAAAEBAJ&oi;=fnd&dq;=dead+pedal&printsec;=abstract#v=onepage&q;=dead%20pedal&f;=false and by making it serve a function as an engine regulator.https://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr;=&vid;=USPAT6347680&id;=FXEJAAAAEBAJ&oi;=fnd&dq;=dead+pedal&printsec;=abstract#v=onepage&q;=dead%20pedal&f;=false  Type  Footrests The most common and widely available, these dead pedals come in the form of foot rests that are put on the car floor. They come in many forms: some are metal plates, some are rubber pads, and some are simply a raised area of the car floor. Dummy pedals These are fake pedals that don't actually serve a function but are still a native part of the car's pedal system. These can be found in some race cars.http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-dead-pedal.htm  Implementation  Dead pedals have never been a required addition to standard automobile pedal sets. This is because the advantages of having a dead pedal are most commonly associated with manual transmission cars. Furthermore, cars with left side drive often have a natural footrest because of the wheel well so it is more common to find right side drive cars with dead pedals. However, the dead pedal promotes safe driving habits by serving as a place for drivers to place their foot and prevent accidental left foot braking. It is not recommended to brake with the left foot because it is less confusing when switching between automatic and manual transmission cars. Resting one's foot on the brake pedal may also accidentally light up the brake lights when the vehicle is not decelerating. The use of the dead pedal is particularly prevalent in right- hand drive markets where the door's bulkhead cannot be used to rest the left foot, for example in the Renault Megane This area may also include other features not associated with direct operation of the vehicle, for instance a foot button for control of the lights or radio. On certain models of Mercedes Benz and Volvo vehicles, the parking brake is a pedal located here.

Weekly Episode Guide Week 01: IN THE BEGINNING *May 29 ‚Äì June 2, 2006 In a distant future, a time machine hurtles through space. It lands on Earth in the year 1992. Inside are the wife and son of Captain B. Sending them away seems to be the only way to protect them from the clutches of the evil General. Lolo Aloy and Lola Melay find the time machine with the young Arell still inside. They decide to hold on to the child, naming him Teng. As time goes on, Teng grows in strength. Only Lolo Aloy is aware of how super human his new charge is. Teng uses his strength to come to the aid of Leah, who becomes his good friend. Conversely, Clarisse grows further apart from Teng, blaming him for stealing their Lolo's affections from her. Worst of all, Leah gives Teng the bad news that she must leave for the United States. Still, despite the setbacks, Teng grows into a happy young boy. He has his best friends Kit and Bobby. He has the love and tutelage of Lola Melay and Lolo Aloy. Little does he know that his life is fraught with danger and that behind every shadow lurks a possible enemy. But a discovery in a junkyard changes Teng's life forever. Week 02: BIRTH OF A NEW SUPERHERO *June 5 ‚Äì 9, 2006 Captain Barbell discovers that he has more powers than just superhuman strength. He uses them to the best of his abilities in his first public appearance ‚Äì to rescue Cesar, Sandra and Melay from the falling bridge. Everyone wonders who this hero could be. Captain Barbell wonders if he can protect his true identity from the rest of the world, and will he be able to tackle the new responsibilities of being a superhero. Week 03: PUTAKTI'S VENOM *June 12 ‚Äì 16, 2006 Captain Barbell runs to Leah's rescue, only to be attacked by Jared, who has transformed into Putakti - a monstrous wasp. He fails to rescue Leah after the wasp's venom gets into his eye, disabling him to transform again into his superhuman form. When Kit tells her father that Jared might really be the wasp, Joe goes to Jared's house to investigate, where he ultimately discover the truth. Captain Barbell and Putakti battle it out once again, and Jared switches back to his human form after Captain Barbell throws him into a river. When Levi sees the helpless Jared, he beats him to a pulp. Week 04: TETANO AND ADOBE *June 19 ‚Äì 23, 2006 Levi is released from prison with the help of his father. Viel investigates who is trying to kill his son. Kit and Bobby bring their mysterious new friend \\"Blanca\\" to the hospital, only to find out that she is completely well except for her memory loss. Blanca eventually gets to know Sandra and Cesar. Barbara comes to the rescue during Captain Barbell's battle with Tetano. She brings Teng to her home, where Teng witnesses Borris's extraordinary strength. He begins to wonder if there are others like him. When Teng retrieves the barbell he used to defeat Tetano, he discovers that it has been drained of its powers. Meanwhile, a new villain, Adobe, emerges from the depths of Viel's technopark. It ruins Teng's chances of finding out what really happened to his Lolo Aloy. Week 05: ALTER-EGOS *June 26 ‚Äì 30, 2006 Bobby realizes that Teng is Captain Barbell. But Teng can rest easy because Bobby decides to keep his new discovery a secret. Meanwhile, Viel asks Barbara if she has regained her memory. Barbara lies to Viel saying she still doesn‚Äôt remember anything. She can not remember everything exactly but she is sure that she must be someone else. She vows to find out who she really is, as well as who the person in her dreams was. The evil apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree as Levi attempts to strong-arm Teng into selling the land. His failure only fuels his father's anger. Boris tries to get on Viel's good side by stealing the land title from Teng, except that Teng catches him in the act. This leads to Teng meeting Barbara. As the two bond, the young hero begins to feel more and more at home with this woman. And then Viel falls sick. Dexter tells Viel that Boris‚Äô blood is no longer enough to bring him back to normal. Week 06: VIEL'S SECRET *July 3 ‚Äì 7, 2006 Viel's condition worsens and not even a blood transfusion from Boris can help. He continues to keep this secret from Barbara and Levi. When Levi sees him helpless in Boris‚Äô arms, Viel has no ready explanation. This forces both Barbara and Levi to go on separate fact-finding missions. They begin sharing information. But Barbara finds out much more than she was looking for. Meanwhile, Kit interviews Bubog, who is back as Narciso. He discovers through Kit that it is because of Captain Barbell that he is now Bubog. He vows revenge. Week 07: AEROBIKA'S REVENGE *July 10 ‚Äì 14, 2006 Everyone's head over heels for the hot new physical education teacher in school, Ms. Eros. Little do they know that Ms. Eros was once the obese Ms. Patti who was teased as ‚ÄúAero Biik.‚Äù Her transformation is due to the slimming tea she discovered from a plant contaminated with barbanium. She started the slimming hype in school to help out people like her who have been consistently teased about being overweight. She also uses her new power as a way of seeking revenge on people who have been mean to her in the past. Even Bobby joins the bandwagon. Ms. Eros becomes Aerobika, the super being who is obsessed with making everyone sexy ‚Äì and addicted to her slimming tea! Meanwhile, Viel becomes even more powerful with Dexter's new discovery, the crystal acid. Being the scheming villain that he is, Viel uses this for his evil plans. Levi and Clarisse's friendship grows more each day. Week 08: DATE WITH CAPTAIN BARBELL *July 17 ‚Äì 21, 2006 Levi and Teng's friendship gets back on track when Levi saves Teng from drowning in the river contaminated with crystal acid. Aerobika is already running out of leaves for her slimming tea, but she still threatens the police that she will do something disastrous unless they give her a chance to date Captain Barbell. Captain Barbell obliges, but the only problem is his date with Aerobika coincides with Teng's date with Leah. Meanwhile, Viel discovers more uses for his crystal acid, which are all potential threats to the community. Week 09: CONSEQUENCES AND CONFESSIONS *July 24 ‚Äì 28, 2006 With the help of Viel's breakthrough experiments, Mayor Lazaro is able to resurrect his wife Myra. Although Leah and Lazaro are overjoyed to have Myra back, Agnes is suspicious of Myra's return, especially since she seems like a different person this time around. A new villain Marvin, who has been named ‚ÄúVaporo‚Äù by the police for his exemplary stealing strategy (nobody notices him because he turns into vapor), is on the loose. Marvin got his powers from a contaminated shooting star that fell into the river that he was in. Marvin has a crush on Kit but Kit tell him she doesn't have any feelings for him but for Teng and this forces Marvin/Vaporo to bring Kit to the Lighthouse. Two people will finally have the guts to confess their feelings to their special someone. Week 10: JARED RETURNS *July 31 ‚Äì August 4, 2006 Kit tries to ignore Teng after confessing her feelings for him, while Levi fights for Clarisse despite his father's disapproval. Jared makes a comeback, and he is able to make Leah believe that he is innocent. Leah suddenly becomes secretive after promising Jared that she will help him out. Captain Barbell battles with Jared once more. Week 11: CLARISSE'S MISSION *August 7 ‚Äì 11, 2006 The General assigns a mission to Clarisse's alter ego, Ex-o. She has to find and kill Arell. Ex-o's powers will soon take over Clarisse's body, even when she is not sleepwalking. Kit tries her best to be happy for Teng, and she patches up her friendship with him when her screenplay is chosen to be featured in school. But the problem arises when Teng and Leah audition and grab the lead roles. Meanwhile, Cyborg 5566 attacks Marravelos. Week 12: CAPTAIN BARBELL IS SICK *August 14 ‚Äì 18, 2006 Captain Barbell falls from the sky, significantly weakened from his face-off with Ex-o. Upon seeing him so helpless, Kit and Bobby rush the superhero to the hospital. Meanwhile, Boris discovers his father's mysterious illness, and how Viel has been using his blood to get better. Viel tells his son that all they need is Captain Barbell for him to be well again. The evil duo takes advantage of Captain Barbell's confinement to capture him. Lola Melay comes to the rescue when she finds out that Captain Barbell is in the hospital. Apparently, she has known all along that Teng and Captain Barbell are the same. Week 13: EX-O'S BATTLE *August 21 ‚Äì 25, 2006 Sandra and Cesar find out about Clarisse's alter ego, Ex-O. Captain Barbell promises them that he will not harm their daughter when he fights Ex-O. Teng also realizes that his weakness is Askobar, but he discovers that he becomes immune to it when it's contained in glass. The aerial battle between Ex-O and Captain B ends in tragedy. Levi devastated with the death of Clarisse, and vows revenge against Captain Barbell. Week 14: BLACK-OUT, A NEW HERO *August 28 ‚Äì September 1, 2006 Teng has decided to leave his superhero days behind. He is instantly replaced by ‚ÄúBlackout,‚Äù the newest crime-busting hero in Maravelos. Blackout, who used to be Ruben, got his powers through electricity, which enables him to do everything that Captain B used to do ‚Äì even fly! He also has another edge: he's not weakened by Askobar. After witnessing the public's clamor for Blackout, Teng cannot help but think twice about the drastic decision he made. Meanwhile, Mayor Lazaro gives to Viel the Magtanggol's land title, in exchange for Myra's resurrection. But the mayor doesn‚Äôt know that Myra is planning something evil for him and Leah. With this new development, can Teng save Leah without his alter ego Captain Barbell's breast plate? Week 15: A SUPERHERO'S DESTINY *September 4 ‚Äì 8, 2006 In an attempt to avenge Jennifer's death, Ruben murders the killer, Leon, and he ends up in prison. Viel takes advantage of Ruben's imprisonment by bribing him with the opportunity to be ‚ÄúBlackout‚Äù again. But what the Villains really want is for Captain Barbell to return to Maravelos so they could capture him. As planned, Blackout gatecrashes a party organized by Boris so Captain Barbell will realize that he's still needed in Maravelos. Teng soon realizes that he has to do something about Blackout. With the help of his friends, he retrieves Captain Barbell's breast plate from the place where they buried it. A face-off between Captain B and a fully charged (from the town's power plant) Blackout will ensues. Week 16: AMORSECO'S LOVE *September 11 ‚Äì 15, 2006 Week 17: MB, THE MASKED BANDIT *September 18 ‚Äì 22, 2006 With Bobby's help, Teng transforms into Captain Barbell and manages to make things right once again in Maravelos. He conjures a mighty whirlwind to suck all the amorseco spuds that affected the townspeople. When things get back to normal, Joe confesses to Lady Amor that he still loves her, while Teng and Leah decide to split up for the meantime. Meanwhile, Levi becomes Leah's confidante. But a masked bandit with the letters ‚ÄúMB‚Äù on his breastplate soon attacks Viel's properties. MB also tells Captain Barbell that he is not the enemy. Week 18: COACH DRIBBLE AND THE ASKOBOYS *September 25 ‚Äì 29, 2006 Captain Barbell fails to prevent the assassination of Mayor Lazaro, and Teng is devastated with Leah's situation. Leah returns the Magtanggol land title to Teng and tells him that they‚Äôre even. Apparently, she's still bitter about what happened between them. Meanwhile, Ms. Florendo announces that Marravelos Academy is about to be closed down because Viel pulled out his financial aid for the school. When the school rallies against Viel, he poses a condition that could possibly change his mind: Marravelos Academy (M.A.) needs to win over Marravelos University (M.U.) in a basketball game. But the players of M.A. are no match for the players of M.U., who have been drugged by the strength-inducing askobar steroids by Coach Dribble. Week 19: MB SAVES CAPTAIN BARBELL *October 2 ‚Äì 6, 2006 With Captain Barbell's help, Marravelos Academy wins over Marravelos University. But instead of celebrating, Bobby and Lola Melay are left worried sick because Captain Barbell suddenly disappears after the game. It was no other than Viel who captured him, and Levi takes advantage of the opportunity to beat up Captain Barbell with special Askobar knuckle bars. But just when he's about to stab the superhero with a slab of Askobar, the Maskaradong Bandido suddenly appears. A new villain is sent in by the General ‚Äì the cyborg Magnetika whose goal is to accomplished the failed plan of Ex-O. Kit will ultimately discover that Captain Barbell has been Teng all along. Week 20: MAGNETIKA'S FORCES *October 9 ‚Äì 13, 2006 Kit gets mad at both Captain Barbell and Bobby when he sees Captain Barbell kissing Magnetika in the barn. Outside the barn Joe and Cesar are also at odds over Magna. Aurora wonders why neither of the two want to remove the rings that Magna gave them. She does not yet realize that it is through these rings that Magna is controlling Joe and Cesar. But an investigation leads Kit and Aurora to the truth about Magna ‚Äì and Magnetika. Now that her cover is blown, she demands to see Captain Barbell again. Or else she will continue to wreak her havoc on the men of the town. She feeds on the life essence of the men, making them younger and younger until they just disappear. One of her victims is Bobby, and so Teng must become Captain Barbell to once again face the nasty villainess. Meanwhile, Dexter betrays Viel when he discovers a way to make the time vessel work. But Viel finds out and decides to punish Dexter, however something goes terribly wrong. Then Magnetika meets Viel and the two trade secrets. Magnetika gives Viel an offer he can not refuse. Week 21: THE TRUTH ABOUT BORIS *October 16 ‚Äì 20, 2006 Viel confirms his suspicions that Barbara is the Maskaradong Bandido. He and Magnetika make plans to avoid her. He asks Magnetika if she knows where Boris could be. He has to find Boris before Boris finds out the truth behind his real parents. Or worse, the truth of Boris‚Äô brother actually is. Meanwhile, Barbra tells her tales of her life as the masked bandit. She takes Teng to her fortress and decides it is time for Teng to know everything about his past. She also confides that she believes Captain B is still alive. She wants to take Teng in the time vessel to look for Captain B. But she tells him that with or without him, she plans to leave the present and go back to the future. Before she can get her plans underway, a terrible confrontation happens. Torn and unable to decide what (and who) to believe in, Boris is driven over the edge. Week 22: CAPTAIN B'S EVIL WAYS *October 23 ‚Äì 27, 2006 The relationship between Levi and Leah gets complicated as she unintentionally expresses her true feelings for Teng. Levi gets more jealous of Teng. Viel, meanwhile, realizes that he needs Captain Barbell to be able to walk again. After Magna shares what she knows about the superhero, Viel and Levi become suspicious that Teng and Captain Barbell are one and the same. Captain B is sent by the General to present-day Marravelos. His mission, now that his brain has been re-programmed by the General, will put Captain Barbell against his own father. Teng and his classmates are put in danger by their new teacher.

Every law shall be cited an SFS number, including legislation amending already existing law. The number contained in the citation consists of a four digit year, a colon and then an incrementing number by year. For instance, the Instrument of Government is SFS 1974:152, with each amendment having its own SFS number. The amendments are usually referred to as (year:number) in the main law text. Unlike most continental European countries, however, Sweden's codified statutes do not include a comprehensive Civil Code comparable to the German BGB or the French Civil Code and instead set forth statutory law in a piecemeal fashion.\\"Legislation Sweden\\" https://www.lexadin.nl/wlg/legis/nofr/eur/lxwezwe.htm#Civil Law For example, rather than addressing the law of obligations in one major title of a comprehensive civil code, Sweden addresses the subset of the law of obligations pertaining to torts in an isolated statute passed piecemeal in 1972 that is not itself comprehensive or complete.Jan Hellner, \\"Modern Swedish Perspectives: The New Swedish Tort Liability Act\\" 22(1) The American Journal of Comparative Law 1 (Winter 1974) DOI: 10.2307/839054 https://www.jstor.org/stable/839054 Similarly, Sweden's contract act just addresses selected topics in contract law leaving the rest to case law, rather than comprehensively addressing all facets of contract law as a civil code on the subject would.Christina Ramberg, \\"The Hidden Secrets Of Scandinavian Contract Law\\" Stockholm Institute of Scandinavian Law (2010) http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/50-15.pdf In other words, Swedish statutes are more similar in character to statutes in the United States and other Commonwealth nations than to the comprehensive civil codes that predominate in continental European civil law systems and similar systems in Asia and Latin America based upon the continental European civil law systems. The Swedish Code of Statutes is enacted into statutory law, but is enacted into its own unified legal code, which contains all of the laws enacted by the Swedish government, and includes the criminal law, criminal procedure, government regulations, legal information, civil law, agriculture, and many other major topic areas and subject matter that are important to the development and society of Sweden. The code is derived into positive law, with a mix of statutory law and civil law, and is amended from time to time. It also contains the Constitution of Sweden.

For others with the name Malcolm Rogers, please see Malcolm Rogers (disambiguation). Malcolm Jennings Rogers (1890‚Äì1960) was a pioneering archaeologist in southern California, Baja California, and Arizona. Born in Fulton, New York, Rogers studied mining geology at Syracuse University and initially worked as a mining geologist. After service in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War I, he moved to Escondido, California in 1919 and took up citrus farming. However, he was soon involved with local archaeology and associated with the San Diego Museum of Man. He moved to San Diego and became a full-time Curator at the museum in 1930, continuing at that post until his resignation in 1945. Health and other personal problems resulted in a hiatus in his archaeological work, which he resumed in 1958 as a Research Associate at the museum. He was working on his previous notes and collections in 1960 when a traffic accident caused his death (Ezell 1961; Pourade 1966; Hanna 1982, 2013). Rogers' fieldwork included extensive survey and excavation work in the coastal zone of San Diego County and northwestern Baja California, as well as throughout the California deserts to the east and western Arizona (Apple 2013; Hedges 2013; Laylander and Bend√≠mez 2013; Pigniolo 2013; Schaefer 2013; Schneider 2013). He identified and named the San Dieguito, La Jolla, Amargosa, and Yuman archaeological complexes (Rogers 1929a, 1929b, 1939, 1945, 1966; Warren 1966, 2013; Sutton 2013). He also produced one of the earliest ethnoarchaeological studies of pottery-making among the surviving native peoples of his region (Rogers 1936; Panich and Wilken-Robertson 2013). Rogers' contributions were sometimes confusing to his successors, as in the case of his changing nomenclature for the San Dieguito Complex and its constituent phases. Working primarily before the advent of radiocarbon dating, he adhered to a short chronology for regional prehistory that has subsequently been discarded. His published observations, manuscript notes, and collections on aboriginal ceramics were never worked into a full-blown typology, and later analysts have interpreted them with markedly different conclusions (Schroeder 1958; May 1978; Van Camp 1979; Waters 1982a, 1982b; Seymour 1997; Burton and Quinn 2013). One researcher noted that Rogers' reports \\"so often present his formulations without detailing the evidence on which they are founded\\" (Ezell 1961:533). Nonetheless, these formulations continue to be the starting point for most research in the region, and his observations of so much that has subsequently been lost from the archaeological record have become indispensable.

The sexes are very dis-similar in appearance. The male has a white head and throat and the remaining plumage is chestnut brown. From the base of his beak dangle three long, slender, black wattles that he uses in display. The female has olive plumage with yellowish streaked underparts and a yellow vent area. The three-wattled bellbird breeds in montane regions of Costa Rica and migrates to western Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. The male bird has a loud, distinctive, bell-like call, and as these birds are secretive and shy, they are more often heard than seen. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed their conservation status as \\"vulnerable\\". Description One of four species of bellbird that live in Central and South America, the three-wattled bellbird is between and long. The body, tail, and wings of the male are uniformly chestnut-brown; its head, neck, and upper breast are white; and it has a black eye-ring, eye- stripe, and bill. Its name comes from the three worm-like wattles of skin that hang from the base of the bill. These wattles can be as long as when extended during songs and interactions. The wattles remain flaccid even when extended. The male shakes the wattles, but otherwise they hang straight down; they are neither erectile nor under muscular control. The side wattles do not stick out to the sides and the central one is not extended directly skywards as shown on some old illustrations and specimens. The purpose of the wattles is unclear. The female bellbirds are smaller and less striking in appearance, being overall olive with yellowish streaking below, pure yellow vent and no wattles. The females blend into the surroundings of the forest, which helps them hide its nests from predators. The nests are very difficult to spot. As of January 2019, only six nests had been found in Monteverde, according to the council for the Bellbird Biological Corridor. Juvenile males are often confused with females; they have the same coloring as females until they reach sexual maturity at age 7. As they age, the males slowly molt the green and brown feathers and begin to grow the striking white and copper coat. They do not begin to grow their wattles until they are 1 to 2 years old, and the wattles continue to grow for the entirety of the male bird's life. Distribution Famous for having one of the most unusual and distinct vocalizations of any bird in its range, the three-wattled bellbird exists from western Honduras south to eastern Panama. Bellbirds breed primarily in Costa Rican highlands in the cloud forest (March‚ÄìSeptember) and return to lower elevations in the mangroves for the interim months. Mating The bellbird has its own unique mating ritual. The male birds sneak up behind the females perching on a high branches. As the male quietly approaches the female, he opens his mouth a full 180 degrees to make his distinctive \\"bonk\\" sound in her ear, knocking the female off of her branch. They repeat this sequence, and after the courtship is over, the female departs to build the nest and raise the chicks alone. Ecology The species is completely frugivorous; it swallows the fruits from trees in the Lauraceae family, of which the avocado is a member.https://www.anywhere.com/flora-fauna/bird/three-wattled-bellbird The bellbird performs an important role in seed dispersal. It regurgitates the seeds it cannot digest and deposits them in gap areas beneath song perches, which nearly doubles seedling survival rate. Song Taxidermied male specimen (in living individuals, the three elongated wattles typically hang loosely down beside the bill) Male in Costa Rica Because of the secretive behavior of this bird, it is often only detected by the distinctive bell-like call given by the males. At close range, the vocalization of many in Costa Rica is heard as a complex three-part song, the \\"bonk\\" giving the bird its name. This hollow, wooden \\"bonk\\" is thought to be among the loudest bird calls on Earth, audible to humans from over away. The song is different in Nicaragua and in also Panama, and these songs also include an extremely loud, but less bell-like, note. The song may also be a short \\"Heee-Ahhh.\\" In some instances, it has been described as sounding like microphone feedback. Research by Donald Kroodsma on recordings archived at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology showed that the three-wattled bellbird is unique among members of its sub-order, in that it learns its song, rather than having the song determined by instinct, because the song changed over the years that it had been recorded. Status The population trend of the three-wattled bellbird is on a downward trend because of destruction of the bird's forest habitat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed their conservation status as \\"vulnerable\\". The Monteverde Institute in Costa Rica is working to conserve the bellbird's natural habitat through its reforestation program. The organization has planted over 250,000 trees of more than 140 species in the Bellbird Biological Corridor in attempt to bridge the habitats that many species require for migration.https://monteverde-institute.org/reforestation- program.html References Further reading * Snow, D.W.

NY 314 extends for through the Clinton County town of Plattsburgh from Interstate 87 (I-87) exit 39 to U.S. Route 9\\\\. NY 314 previously continued another to the ferry landing on Cumberland Head. Its Vermont counterpart is a loop route off of U.S. Route 2 (US 2) through the Grand Isle County towns of South Hero and Grand Isle that connects to the ferry near its midpoint. VT 314 was originally designated as Vermont Route F-3 in the late 1920s. The roadway on the New York side was unnumbered until , when Cumberland Head Road was designated as NY 314\\\\. VT F-3 was redesignated as VT 314 in 1964 to match the designation present at the New York ferry approach. In 2005, a new highway connecting US 9 to the ferry landing by way of the interior of Cumberland Head was completed and opened to traffic as the Commodore Thomas MacDonough Highway. NY 314 was realigned to follow the new highway while ownership and maintenance of its old alignment was transferred to the town of Plattsburgh. The designation of NY 314 east of US 9 was removed by July 2014. Route description NY 314 NY 314 begins at Adirondack Northway (I-87) exit 39 in the town of Plattsburgh. The route heads southeast as a four-lane divided highway known as Moffitt Road to an intersection with US 9 (the Lakes to Locks Passage), where NY 314 terminates, just from the I-87 interchange.  VT 314  VT 314 begins at an intersection with US 2 just north of Keeler Bay, a village in the town of South Hero. The route heads northwestward as Ferry Road, passing by a small number of homes situated amongst open fields. At the western edge of Grand Isle, VT 314 intersects West Shore Road, a local highway that runs along the western shoreline of the island. The route turns north onto West Shore Road, following the roadway along Lake Champlain and into the town of Grand Isle. Here, the route's surroundings are mainly the same as it proceeds toward Gordon Landing. In Gordon Landing, VT 314 connects to a ferry landing for the Grand Isle‚ÄìPlattsburgh Ferry (which leads to Clinton CR 57) by way of an unnamed extension of Bell Hill Road. VT 314 continues northward along West Shore Road to Allen Road, where the route turns to follow Allen Road eastward across the island. While on Allen Road, the route passes through an area of open fields and forests that contains only a couple dozen homes. VT 314 continues eastward to another junction with US 2, where the route comes to an end. History Designations All of modern VT 314 was originally designated as VT F-3 in the late 1920s. At Gordon Landing, VT F-3 connected to Cumberland Head in New York by way of the Grand Isle‚ÄìPlattsburgh Ferry across Lake Champlain. The primary highway leading from the New York ferry landing to US 9 near Plattsburgh, then Cumberland Head Road, was initially unnumbered. VT F-3 was maintained by the towns of South Hero and Grand Isle until June 20, 1957, when the state of Vermont assumed ownership and maintenance of the highway. The portion of the Adirondack Northway (I-87) between exits 36 and 39 was completed and opened to traffic . Moffitt Road was upgraded between the new freeway and US 9 as part of the Northway's construction. By the following year, the upgraded piece of Moffitt Road and the piece of Cumberland Head Road between US 9 and the ferry landing was designated as NY 314. From I-87 to US 9, NY 314 was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation; the remainder of the route was maintained by Clinton County and co-designated as CR 42. VT F-3 was renumbered to VT 314 on May 1, 1964 to match the designation now present at the New York ferry approach. Cumberland Head connector The idea of a building a new highway that would lead directly from US 9 to the ferry landing at the southern tip of Cumberland Head was first proposed in 1964. At that time, a group of Cumberland Head residents stated that the existing narrow and winding perimeter road (NY 314) jeopardized the safety of residents and motorists alike. As time went on, the problem grew worse as the amount of traffic traveling to and from the ferry increased. The proposal finally gained traction in 2002 when New York State Senator Ronald B. Stafford was able to procure most of the $7.3 million required to build the highway. Construction on the new route began in March 2005 following three years of studies and planning. The Cumberland Head connector began at the east end of the divided highway portion of NY 314 and would pass through the rural interior of the peninsula on its way to the ferry landing. Part of the road would utilize the preexisting Lighthouse Road. It was built as a super two highway with a speed limit, higher than that of the perimeter road. The project was initially expected to be completed around November 2006; however, it was completed nearly a year ahead of schedule. On December 1, 2005, the new highway was named the Commodore Thomas MacDonough Highway in honor of Thomas MacDonough, an American naval officer who defeated the British in the Battle of Plattsburgh during the War of 1812. The road opened to traffic about a week later, co-designated as NY 314 (which was realigned to follow the length of the highway) and CR 57. Following the completion of the project, ownership and maintenance of Cumberland Head Road (NY 314's former routing) was to be transferred from Clinton County to the town of Plattsburgh. The transfer was officially approved on September 13, 2006. The new highway has only two intersections, both with Cumberland Head Road. This was by design as no access roads were built off of the route in an effort to improve safety along the highway. One part of the finished highway that drew controversy was a one-way ramp built between the eastbound MacDonough Highway and the west end of Cumberland Head Road. Some residents criticized the layout, stating that it made it difficult to travel to and from MacDonough Highway and Cumberland Head Road. Ironically, the ramp was added as a result of public input; the initial project designs did not call for a ramp. Instead, all traffic to and from Cumberland Head Road would have had to utilize the junction with MacDonough Highway to the east. The designation of NY 314 east of US 9 was removed by July 2014.

IGN's Eric Brudvig writes: \\"Though at first glance you might think there are 14 levels in Raiden IV ... there are in fact only seven with the second half of the game merely repeating the first.... UFO Interactive Games went ahead and added insult to injury with its use of downloadable content. After dishing out $40 for the game, you'll find that only one of the three ships on the main menu can be used. The other two must be purchased through Xbox Live.\\" Backlash over the pay to play ships has created controversy at several gaming forums, leading gamers to wonder whether the extra content is worth the price to obtain them.Raiden IV review at IGN References External links Raiden IV for NESiCAxLive website *INH Raiden IV -Ultimate of Raiden- website * Category:2007 video games Category:Arcade games Category:MOSS games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:NESiCAxLive games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Raiden IV"},{"id":"7122350","text":"Brent Fletcher is an American television writer.

In: Reddy EP, Skalka AM, Curran T (eds.). The Oncogene Handbook 1988 Elsevier, New York, pp 307‚Äì327, It was first discovered in rat fibroblasts as the transforming gene of the FBJ MSV (Finkel‚ÄìBiskis‚ÄìJinkins murine osteogenic sarcoma virus) (Curran and Tech, 1982). It is a part of a bigger Fos family of transcription factors which includes c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2. It has been mapped to chromosome region 14q21‚Üíq31. c-Fos encodes a 62 kDa protein, which forms heterodimer with c-jun (part of Jun family of transcription factors), resulting in the formation of AP-1 (Activator Protein-1) complex which binds DNA at AP-1 specific sites at the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes and converts extracellular signals into changes of gene expression. It plays an important role in many cellular functions and has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers.  Structure and function  c-fos is a 380 amino acid protein with a basic leucine zipper region for dimerisation and DNA-binding and a transactivation domain at C-terminus, and, like Jun proteins, it can form homodimers. In vitro studies have shown that Jun‚ÄìFos heterodimers are more stable and have stronger DNA-binding activity than Jun‚ÄìJun homodimers. A variety of stimuli, including serum, growth factors, tumor promoters, cytokines, and UV radiation induce their expression. The c-fos mRNA and protein is generally among the first to be expressed and hence referred to as an immediate early gene. It is rapidly and transiently induced, within 15 minutes of stimulation. Its activity is also regulated by posttranslational modification caused by phosphorylation by different kinases, like MAPK, CDC2, PKA or PKC which influence protein stability, DNA-binding activity and the trans-activating potential of the transcription factors. It can cause gene repression as well as gene activation, although different domains are believed to be involved in both processes. It is involved in important cellular events, including cell proliferation, differentiation and survival; genes associated with hypoxia; and angiogenesis; which makes its dysregulation an important factor for cancer development. It can also induce a loss of cell polarity and epithelial- mesenchymal transition, leading to invasive and metastatic growth in mammary epithelial cells. The importance of c-fos in biological context has been determined by eliminating endogenous function by using anti-sense mRNA, anti- c-fos antibodies, a ribozyme that cleaves c-fos mRNA or a dominant negative mutant of c-fos. The transgenic mice thus generated are viable, demonstrating that there are c-fos dependent and independent pathways of cell proliferation, but display a range of tissue-specific developmental defects, including osteoporosis, delayed gametogenesis, lymphopenia and behavioral abnormalities.  Clinical significance  The AP-1 complex has been implicated in transformation and progression of cancer. In osteosarcoma and endometrial carcinoma, c-Fos overexpression was associated with high-grade lesions and poor prognosis. Also, in a comparison between precancerous lesion of the cervix uteri and invasive cervical cancer, c-Fos expression was significantly lower in precancerous lesions. c-Fos has also been identified as independent predictor of decreased survival in breast cancer. It was found that overexpression of c-fos from class I MHC promoter in transgenic mice leads to the formation of osteosarcomas due to increased proliferation of osteoblasts whereas ectopic expression of the other Jun and Fos proteins does not induce any malignant tumors. Activation of the c-Fos transgene in mice results in overexpression of cyclin D1, A and E in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, which might contribute to the uncontrolled growth leading to tumor. Human osteosarcomas analyzed for c-fos expression have given positive results in more than half the cases and c-fos expression has been associated with higher frequency of relapse and poor response to chemotherapy. Several studies have raised the idea that c-Fos may also have tumor-suppressor activity, that it might be able to promote as well as suppress tumorigenesis. Supporting this is the observation that in ovarian carcinomas, loss of c-Fos expression correlates with disease progression. This double action could be enabled by differential protein composition of tumour cells and their environment, for example, dimerisation partners, co-activators and promoter architecture. It is possible that the tumor suppressing activity is due to a proapoptotic function. The exact mechanism by which c-Fos contributes to apoptosis is not clearly understood, but observations in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells indicate that c-Fos is a mediator of c-myc-induced cell death and might induce apoptosis through the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Fas ligand (FASLG or FasL) and the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10 or TRAIL) might reflect an additional apoptotic mechanism induced by c-Fos, as observed in a human T-cell leukaemia cell line. Another possible mechanism of c-Fos involvement in tumour suppression could be the direct regulation of BRCA1, a well established factor in familial breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, the role of c-fos and other Fos family proteins has also been studied in endometrial carcinoma, cervical cancer, mesotheliomas, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, melanomas, thyroid carcinomas, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, etc. Cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and other psychoactive drugs have been shown to decrease c-fos production in the mesocortical pathway (prefrontal cortex) as well as in the mesolimbic reward pathway (nucleus accumbens). c-Fos repression by ŒîFosB's AP-1 complex within the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens acts as a molecular switch that enables the chronic induction of ŒîFosB, thus allowing it to accumulate more rapidly. As such, the c-Fos promoter finds utilization in drug addiction research in general, as well as with context- induced relapse to drug-seeking and other behavioral changes associated with chronic drug taking. An increase in c-Fos production in androgen receptor- containing neurons has been observed in rats after mating.  Applications  Expression of c-fos is an indirect marker of neuronal activity because c-fos is often expressed when neurons fire action potentials. Upregulation of c-fos mRNA in a neuron indicates recent activity. The c-fos promoter has also been utilised for drug abuse research. Scientists use this promoter to turn on transgenes in rats, allowing them to manipulate specific neuronal ensembles to assess their role in drug-related memories and behavior. This neuronal control can be replicated with optogenetics or DREADDs  Interactions  c-Fos has been shown to interact with: * BCL3, * COBRA1, * CSNK2A1, * CSNK2A2, * DDIT3, * JUN * NCOA1;, * NCOR2, * RELA, * RUNX1, * RUNX2, * SMAD3, and * TBP. {Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis. |} See also *Leptomycin *c-Jun *Egr-1 References Further reading   External links  Drosophila kayak - The Interactive Fly  * Category:Oncogenes Category:Transcription factors Œî0 ","title":"C-Fos"},{"id":"7122400","text":"Janet Tamaro is an American television writer, series creator, executive producer, and showrunner.

Early life MacPherson was raised in South Lanarkshire. He left Hamilton Grammar School at 17 and got a job as a laboratory technician at the Institute of Neurosciences at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. Part of his job was to collect brain samples for experimentation. MacPherson worked in the lab for five years and met his future wife Jacqueline while he was there. MacPherson went for an interview to be a police officer, but soon realised that he did not have the requisite personality for the job. It was then that his thoughts turned to acting. He joined an amateur dramatic group in Motherwell, before moving on to a repertory theatre in East Kilbride and a place in drama school. It was after MacPherson landed the part of Hugh Hamilton in Citizens on BBC Radio 4 that his television career began to take off. While he was based in London MacPherson auditioned for a part in the children's series Dramarama, but was unsuccessful. Then, in 1986, his agent told him about a part that had come up in Taggart and, after he regained his Glasgow accent, which had been diluted by working in London, he was offered the part. Taggart, career and personal life Initially the character of Jardine was to be a foil to DS Livingstone, assistant to DCI Jim Taggart (Mark McManus), but when Neil Duncan left the show shortly after MacPherson joined it Jardine became Jim Taggart's permanent right-hand man. He then became the central character following McManus's death in 1994. McManus was godfather to MacPherson's daughter Katie. 2002 saw MacPherson's last appearance as DCI Michael Jardine. MacPherson was forced to leave the show due to ill health. He had a collapsed lung and underwent life-saving surgery, which resulted in the lung being stapled to the inside of his chest. This prevented him from doing many of the activities that acting as Jardine required. MacPherson's final episode, \\"Death Trap\\", was aired on 14 January 2002. Since Taggart MacPherson has concentrated on the theatre. Much of his early stage work saw him cast as a policeman. He appeared as Jardine in all but name in a TV documentary investigating claims that Scottish MPs were bribed to pass the Acts of Union of 1707. He also guest-starred in several episodes of The Bill as a former officer whose sister was raped by other policemen. He provided the voice for Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus in the talking book series. In 2000 MacPherson appeared in a Channel 4 Schools History series The Scots Detective, playing DI Scott. In July 2002 he set up an acting company with the Scots actress Emma Currie called Acting Up. In October 2003 MacPherson formed a rock and roll band called The Cams with ex-Wet Wet Wet drummer Tommy Cunningham, and was seen singing with the band on Children in Need on BBC One Scotland the following month. Christmas 2003 saw MacPherson appear as Abananzar in Aladdin at His Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen. In 2007 he starred in the stage version of Dial M for Murder with Faye Tozer of Steps. In May 2010 MacPherson co- starred as Martin Schulse in the Tron Theatre's production of Address Unknown adapted from the short story by Kathrine Kressmann Taylor. In 2014, amidst widespread speculation, it was confirmed that MacPherson narrated Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography. MacPherson has three children with his wife.

Life Moore was born in York, a brother of both Albert Joseph and John Collingham, and the pupil of their father, William Moore. Henry was educated at York and was taught painting by his father. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1853, and exhibited his first picture, Glen Clunie, Braemar, at the Royal Academy in the same year. He was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Academy from that time onwards. He exhibited at the Portland Gallery from 1855 to 1860, and at the British Institution from 1855 to 1865. It was also in 1855 that he sent the first of many contributions to the gallery of the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street. He was a member of that society from 1867 to 1875. He was also a constant contributor, both in oils and watercolours, to the Dudley Gallery from 1865 to 1882. He became an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1876, and a full member in 1880. He contributed in later years to the Grosvenor Gallery and the New Gallery. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy on 4 June 1885, and a full Royal Academician on 4 May 1893. The Rainbow Almost all his early pictures were landscapes, painted in many parts of England, or, about 1856, in Switzerland. It was towards 1870, that he began to devote himself almost exclusively to the marine subjects in which the best work of his maturity was done. He had a profound and scientific knowledge of wave-form, acquired at the cost of exposure in all weathers, and he was generally content to paint the sea itself without introducing ships or human figures. He made his studies chiefly in the English Channel. He was a fine colourist, and held the foremost rank among English marine painters of his day. Among the most remarkable of his Academy pictures are A White Calm (1858), The Launch of the Lifeboat (1876), now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Cat's-paws off the Land, which was bought out of the funds of the Chautrey Bequest in 1885, and is now at Tate, The Clearness after Rain (1887), which won for the painter the grand prix and legion of honour at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, A Breezy Day in the Channel (1888), Shine and Shower (1889), Summer at Sea (1893), and Britannia's Realm (1880). An exhibition of ninety pictures by Moore, entitled 'Afloat and Ashore,' was held by the Fine Art Society in 1887. The total number of pictures exhibited by Moore was not far short of six hundred. Shortly before his death an exhibition was held at York of the works of the father, William Moore, and his five artist sons, Edwin, William (still living), John Collingham, Henry, and Albert Joseph. Moore lived for many years at Hampstead, but died at Margate on 22 June 1895. Family Moore was married in 1860 to Mary (died 1890), daughter of Robert Bollans of York. He had two daughters by this marriage.

It was based on Chrysler Europe's Chrysler 180 model, but was also available with larger Australian-made Hemi Six engines. 19,770 Centuras were built.Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 413 Development Engineers from Chrysler Australia and Simca considered modifying the body of a Chrysler 180 sedan and shortening the drive train so they could place the Australian 6-cylinder Hemi engines further back in the body but instead decided to lengthen the nose, as Chrysler Australia apparently felt this created a more aggressive and better-looking car. It also meant fewer changes were needed to \\"Australianise\\" the car, making it economical to assemble. Additional, largely cosmetic changes included a new grill, headlights, bonnet and rear panel and taillights. A brake proportioning valve was fitted to all Centuras from factory to compensate for weight transfer during braking. When the car \\"nose-dived\\" under heavy braking, a mechanical link connected to the proportioning valve reduced the brake pressure on the rear wheels, to prevent them from locking up and causing the back of the car to slide around. This was typical of many European cars of the time but uncommon in Australian cars. Chrysler also experimented with fitting a 5.2-litre (318 ci) American-made V8 but decided that the body lacked the rigidity to cope with the larger engine; the V8 version never went into production. KB Centura Chrysler Centura (KB) GL Chrysler Centura (KB) GL The KB Centuras sold and assembled in Australia not only had a 1981 cc version of the four-cylinder Simca engine but were also available with Australian-made 6-cylinder pushrod 3523/4014 cc hemi engines and BorgWarner 3-speed automatic and 3- or 4-speed manual gearboxes. The four offered 122 hp (SAE), the sixes 142/167 hp (SAE) respectively. The KB series was sold in XL and GL trims, the latter having more equipment, including tachometer, clock, low fuel light (rare for 1975), rear bumper overriders, console (no storage) and optional vinyl roofs. There were no rear demister fitted, although a Smiths unit was fitted by some dealers. The KB model's European pedigree was obvious, with instrumentation in the opposite order and steering column controls on opposite sides. All KB GL spec cars came equipped with a tachometer, however it was optional on XL spec cars (whereas later KC cars only gained a tachometer through special order, or as part of the Sports option package) Interior flow ventilation was improved over the larger Valiant models, as the Centura had two face-level ventilation outlets. Although the A55 6 cylinder Centura Sports Package was fitted to some vehicles ( included body stripes, styled wheels, woodgrain instrument cluster with tachometer, clock and Boca Raton cloth trim), it was common to see dealer fitted options including the styled road wheel option, and stencilled side stripes and bonnet black outs. The sixes also came with larger brakes (60 mm ventilated front discs and 25.4 mm rear finned drums) and a tandem brake reservoir. The six-cylinder Hemi cars used a 5-stud wheel bolt pattern, and the early four-cylinder cars used a 4-stud wheel bolt pattern and only featured solid unventilated brake discs. Later four-cylinder cars shared the same brakes and stud pattern as the sixes, and thus the same wheels. All Centura models were factory fitted with rack-and- pinion steering, however there was no power steering option. Steering could be heavy, so correct tyre fitment and pressures were a must. Factory / dealer fitted air, with the unit located below the heater controls was available but seldom optioned. Very few Centura's left the dealership with e33 engine code although a few examples do exist. Problems Early KB Centuras also experienced quality issues with interior fixtures, with door trims cracking, and torn vinyl trim near stitching lines not uncommon. A story going around is that no Centura models were fitted with starter motor relays, which simply put the load onto the ignition switch when cranking instead, which reduced the ignition switch life in some cars. The starter motor relay is attached to the firewall above the starter motor in all models. Traction in wet weather proved to be poor, with an open differential, relatively large six-cylinder Hemi engine and very light weight over the rear wheels. The importation of the bodies from France into Australia was complicated in 1973 by industrial action, with dockside unions protesting against French Pacific island nuclear testing. The union bans lasted 2 years. There was a myth that many early KB bodies spent months on wharfs exposed to salt air, creating corrosion problems later in these cars' lives. This was not the case. The main problem this caused was to delay the car's initial release onto the market. These vehicles are generally not rust-prone compared to contemporary vehicles of the time, however rust tends to occur in the usual places where moisture and mud tend to accumulate. Areas to check are below the windscreen on both sides of the car, the firewall where the heater is mounted, and the lower sills, especially behind the back wheels and below the front doors. The vinyl roof cover which was a popular and standard fitment on GL models (delete option only) was also a source of water entrapment, creating the possibility of rust in the \\"A\\" pillars and gutters. KC models were more prone to rusting than KB models. This can be attributed to the KC panels being made in Australia from different steel than the KB's imported panels. In addition to the union bans on French imports, parts supply and local Chrysler support for used vehicles also became more complicated when in 1978, Chrysler Europe went bankrupt and was taken over by Peugeot. This Peugeot takeover was soon followed by several French Peugeot/Talbot factory strikes worsening the problems in sourcing parts in Australia. The mix of metric and imperial fasteners used on the 6-cylinder cars is not anything unusual as many contemporary cars such as Holden Commodores had the same mix. The combination of French and Australian parts can make them challenging vehicles to maintain, however most wearing components are readily available from spare-parts suppliers. From the early 1980s parts became difficult to source, with existing stocks being used up and with the wait for French parts sometimes a long one. In the early 1990s Mitsubishi ceased supporting these vehicles with spare parts. Existing stocks of spare parts were auctioned off, and all stock which wasn't sold was disposed of. In the market Six-cylinder cars sold four-to-one in the Australian market over the four-cylinder cars. They had a reputation for providing reasonably decent handling, good torque and outstanding acceleration. Sports options available on Centura models included dealer- fitted stenciled sports stripes (bonnet and sides), special 'Boca-Raton' striped cloth seats and styled steel or alloy wheels. Most of the interior and exterior dealer options from the larger Valiant models were applicable to the Centura, from the dealership. The Centura's main competitors in Australia were four- and six-cylinder Australian-made versions of the Ford Cortina and General Motors' LH, LX and UC Holden Torana and Sunbird. The Centura had much more interior room and boot space than these main rivals, along with a more favorable power-to-weight ratio. Centuras were also seen to compete to a lesser extent with larger-bodied Australian Holdens, Chrysler Valiants (including the sporting Charger coupe) and Ford Falcons. Most competitors, although often lacking the fierce acceleration of the six-cylinder Centura, proved less rust-prone and generally had more modern styling. In retrospect the rather compact Centura was not a typical 1970s medium-sized car. It wouldn't be until after the cancellation of the Centura, when Holden released the Commodore in October 1978, for the market to have a vehicle with similar internal dimensions to the Centura. Chrysler Australia was being starved of funds by its troubled American parent at this time, leaving the larger Valiant sedans persisting with the same chassis platform and basic body shape and interior (Valiants did not have face-level flow-through vents, unlike those in the Centura) for many years. This created an old-fashioned image of the Australian Chrysler-Valiant brand that may have also adversely impacted Centura sales. The Chrysler 180 design was also rather dated by the time the cars arrived in the Australian market (later than intended), further adding to the old-fashioned image of the brand. The bigger Valiants were still popular with rural Australians, who seemed to prefer large, powerful American-style cars, but the Centura didn't have the size or style to meet the needs of that market, either. KC Centura Chrysler Centura (KC) GL Chrysler Centura (KC) GL The KC model (from June 1977 to the end of 1978) series dropped the 2.0 and 3.5 engines, but retained the 4.0-litre. The 4.0-litre comprised a low- compression (7.6:1) Hemi engine which ran on standard-grade fuel and aided fuel economy, and a high-compression two-barrel (9.0:1) version of the Hemi for greater performance and towing ability. The KC also featured greater Australian content, using VDO gauges, a Valiant-style steering wheel, steering column and various other parts from the larger Australian Valiant lineup. The KC was offered in GL or upscale GLX trims, along with the addition of sports package options. KC models could be differentiated by the use of capitalised and serifed typeface for the \\"Centura\\" badge (the KB had this in cursive) and a silver grille insert (KBs had a black grille with a silver border and highlights). By 1979, the Centura had been replaced by the four-cylinder Chrysler Sigma, of Mitsubishi origins. Centuras today Centuras are now very rare on Australian roads, although they appear more common in South Australia. This is probably due to an enduring loyalty to the Chrysler brand, as they had a manufacturing plant in that state before selling it to Mitsubishi in 1980. The nuclear ban's impact on production and parts supply, subsequent rust problems, extremely light weight over the rear of the car, and difficulty early in the cars' used sales life in getting parts from France were probably all factors that contributed to their relatively rapid disappearance from Australian roads.

Plot introduction Colonists from Earth set out for a distant planet, but during the voyage, a factional skirmish turns into an irrevocable grudge, to play out during the course of their colonisation. Rough settlements are soon constructed around the sterile salt environment, yet old tensions quickly develop into war between two of these settlements, the rigid military dictatorship of Senaar and the Als anarchy. The novel explores the motivations of their warfare, and the viewpoints of the two narrators illuminate a dreadful, entwined inevitability. In all aspects of theme, setting, character development and prose style, Salt is a very stark, austere composition. Characters in Salt Salt is narrated from the dual perspective of central characters Barlei and Petja, who function as representatives of Senaar and Als, respectively. Barlei is a senior military official‚Äîeffectively a dictator‚Äîbeholden to the well-defined hierarchy of the colony of Senaar. Petja, a wayfaring Alsist to begin with, hardens into a charismatic terrorist, resolved to resist a Senaar campaign that uses ever flimsier pretexts to continue destruction of the Als collective. Critical reception Reviewing the novel for Infinity Plus, Stuart Carter writes, \\"Doris Lessing and Iain Banks collaborate to rewrite The Dispossessed, and do a better job of it than anyone might reasonably hope! OK, so it's not exactly a blockbuster by-line but, please, trust me on this one‚ÄîSalt is a moving, intelligent and great book.\\" He adds that Petja and Barlei Greg L. Johnson, at SF Site, writes: John C. Snider, reviewing for SciFiDimensions, writes, \\"It's not just that these two parties don't see eye-to-eye‚Äîit's that their cultures are so alien to one another they don't know how to see eye-to-eye. The story of Salt is told, Rashomon-like, through dueling oral histories. ... The reader is forced to interpret these opposing viewpoints, to piece together the 'real' truth if he or she can.

The coat of arms became more emblematically faithful to Communist symbolism: a landscape (depicting a rising sun, a tractor and an oil drill) surrounded by stocks of wheat tied together with a cloth in the colors of the national flag. Between 1948 and 1966, there were three variants. The first came shortly after 1948 (the proclamation of the republic). The next was in 1952 when a red star was added.

During this period, Romania had no de jure national emblem; however, 10-lei coins issued in this period bore a de facto emblem showing a wreath of olive overlaid on the Romanian Flag where the coat of arms would be located on later coins.

One was Greater Wallachia (Muntenia) and the other was Lesser Walachia (Oltenia). There was also the disputed province of Dobruja. These provinces were mostly geographical, not administrative, but from the end of the 15th century, because the Banate of Severin was partitioned between Wallachia and the Kingdom of Hungary, Oltenia was ruled by a ban. Oltenia was known as the Banate of Craiova. It is unknown whether the Despotate of Dobruja originally had a coat of arms. Control of the region over time involved Romania, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. The present coat of arms of Dobruja was created in 1872. Also in 1872, a new form of the Wallachia coat of arms was officiated to represent just Muntenia. In the Middle Ages, Muntenia had had a different heraldic symbol.

Moldova lay between the Ottoman Empire, the Austrian empire and the Russian Empire. The Upper Country (the northwestern part) was occupied by Austrians, who named the land Bucovina. The Lower Country (eastern part) was conquered by the Russian Empire. It was merged with Basarabia, forming the Guberniya of Bessarabia. The remaining portion was preserved as Moldova. In the 17th century, Transnistria was governed by the Principality of Moldova but was never a part of it. Today, the western part of Transnistria is in the Republic of Moldavia while the rest is in Ukraine, as is most of Bugeac (north of Bucovina) and Pocutia.

When a law is published in the Official Gazette of Romania, it is headed by the coat of arms of Romania. The two houses of the Parliament of Romania issue documents that are not laws. These documents bear the coat of arms of the issuing house. The coat of arms of the Senate of Romania is the Coat of arms of Romania surrounded by two olive branches which are tied together with a cloth in the colors of the Flag of Romania. On the yellow section it reads Senat, and on top of the coat of arms it reads Romania. The coat of arms of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania reproduces the eagle of the Coat of arms of Romania surrounded by two olive branches tied together with a golden cloth.

Radhakrishnan (21 August 1927 ‚Äì 26 April 2010) was an Indian politician and member of the 14th Lok Sabha. He also has served as the speaker of Kerala Legislative Assembly. He represented the Chirayinkil constituency of Kerala and was a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) political party. Radhakrishnan held the Chirayinkil seat from 1997 to 2009. An accomplished lawyer-turned-politician, Radhakrishnan hailed from Varkala, and represented the Varkala legislative constituency for several years. Radhakrishnan was an alumnus of Government Law College, Ernakulam. Radhakrishnan was born in Varkala, a town around 40 km from Trivandum, the capital of Kerala State in India, as the eldest of four sons of Vasudevan and Dakshayani. His maternal grandfather, Manampur Govindan Asan, was a well known Sanskrit Scholar and contemporary of Sri Narayana Guru, the great social reformer who lived in Kerala during the 19th Century. The great Malayalam poet, Kumaran Asan was a student of Govindan Asan. Radhakrishnan did his schooling at Varkala. After finishing matriculation, he had to discontinue further studies due to some financial difficulties in his family. He took up teaching to support his family. Afterwards, he completed his under graduate course at Union Christian Colleague, Alwaye. Subsequently he did his graduation in Economics from University College, Trivandrum and majored in Law later on. He joined the Communist Movement by becoming a member of the Communist Party of India during the 1940s. He became the president of the Varkala Panchayat in 1957, when the first democratically elected Communist Government took office in Kerala State. He was married to Saudamini in 1957, a college lecturer in History at the time who later on became the Professor and Head of the Department of History at the Maharaja's College for Women in Trivandrum. Radhakrishnan and Saudamini had two daughters and one son. Prof. Saudamini died in 1994 from complications arising out a cardiac surgery. She was a great source of support to Radhakrishnan, managed and held the family together, when he pursued his political career. After marriage, Radhakrishnan shifted his political base to Trivandrum from Varkala. He set up a brilliant practice for himself at the Trivandrum Bar in Criminal Law and was one of the most sought after lawyers of the time. He also continued his political activities along with his legal career and contested various elections as a candidate of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) with whom he was associated ever since the party was formed in 1964. He contested the State Assembly elections in 1960, 1965, 1970 and 1977 and lost. He also lost the Parliamentary Elections in 1971 from Chirayinkil Constituency in Kerala. During 1967-68, he served as Private Secretary to the then Chief Minister of Kerala, E.M. Sankaran Namboodiripad. Radhakrishnan tasted electoral success in 1980, when he was elected to Kerala State Assembly from Varkala Constituency. He was subsequently re-elected from the same constituency in 1982, 1987 and 1991. During 1987-91, he served as Speaker of the Kerala Assembly. He was known for his impartiality as a Speaker and had on several occasions chided the Government and its ministers in the Assembly during its sessions for their shortcomings in respect of legislative conduct in the Assembly. He was also an expert in constitutional matters and his comments were always sought by the media with regard to interpretation of provisions of Indian Constitution. Radhakrishnan shifted his area of activity to the National Stage when he won the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Indian Parliament) from Chirayinkil Constituency in 1998. He was re-elected from the same constituency in 1998 and 2004 as well, serving as an MP for 12 years. During his time as an MP he was very active in parliamentary debates and was involved in various parliamentary standing committees such as Finance, Member's Privileges etc. He toured the country extensively in pursuance of his parliamentary committee work. He was also a member of Panel of Chairmen in the Lok Sabha (who are called upon to regulate the proceedings in the absence of the Speaker and Dy. Speaker). Radhakrishnan did not contest the elections in 2009 to the Lok Sabha, but continued to be actively involved in politics till his death. He was a District Committee Member of the CPI (M)and was also President of All India Lawyer's Union (AILU) and a farmer's organisation affiliated to the party. Radhakrishnan died battling injuries he suffered in a road accident when he was on his regular morning walk on 22 April 2010. As it appears, he was knocked down by a truck from behind. He was rushed to the Trivandrum Medical College Hospital with rib fracture and other grievous injuries. The rib fracture had punctured his left lung which affected the pulmonary functions. Due to his advanced age of 83 years, one complication after another developed and the doctors had to give up leading to Radhakrishnan breathing his last on the morning of 26 April 2010. He was accorded a State Funeral at his birthplace Varkala, later in the evening. Thousands of people from all walks of life gathered to have a last glimpse during his final journey to Varkala that day. Radhakrishnan was known for his extra ordinary simplicity. He had a clean image unlike many of his ilk, led a spartan life style with little regard for any luxury. He did not even have a cell phone to himself, which even his personal assistants had. He was an affable person, liked good food, the simple things in life and was quite popular among his comrades, constituents and people at large in Kerala. He was fondly called as \\"Annan\\" (big brother in Malayalam) by everyone including his political adversaries. In the year 2012, his grand daughter Parvathy V.cleared Civil Services Examination and joined Indian Information Service. She is currently serving as the Regional Officer of Central Board of Film Certification, Thiruvananthapuram.

Life Billson was born at Ulverscroft, Leicestershire. She was educated at Bedales School, where she became Head Girl, and studied medicine at University College, London from 1918, later moving to Charing Cross Hospital due to the hostility to female students she experienced at UCL. In 1923 she married the actor Miles Malleson; they divorced in 1940. She qualified in 1926 and worked for Holborn Borough Council and the West End Hospital for Nervous Diseases, developing an interest in the fields of fertility, reproduction and sexuality. In 1931, while working for Ealing Borough Council, she became one of the first British doctors to provide birth control advice on behalf of a local authority. In 1935 she published The Principles of Contraception, a practical guide. She became a member of the executive committee of the National Birth Control Association (later the Family Planning Association). In 1936 the Abortion Law Reform Association was started by Alice Jenkins and Janet Chance.Stephen Brooke, ‚ÄòJenkins , Alice Brook (1886‚Äì1967)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2006; online edn, May 2008 accessed 24 Oct 2017 Malleson was amongst its more influential supporters. She courted controversy by supporting the campaign to reform the abortion law. In 1938 she precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year-old rape victim to gynaecologist Aleck Bourne. He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial for it. Malleson gave evidence at the trial and Bourne's acquittal set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in similar circumstances. Malleson was also a supporter of eugenics and member of the Eugenics Society. In 1950 she was appointed head of the contraceptive clinic at University College Hospital.

W. Haslehust Roxburgh Castle is a ruined royal castle that overlooks the junction of the rivers Tweed and Teviot, in the Borders region of Scotland. Its castleton developed into the royal burgh of Roxburgh, which the Scots destroyed along with the castle after capturing it in 1460. Today the ruins stand in the grounds of Floors Castle, the seat of the Duke of Roxburghe, across the river from Kelso. History Tradition states that King David I founded the castle; it is first recorded in c.1128 during his reign. In 1174, it was surrendered to England after the capture of William I at Alnwick, and was often in English hands thereafter. The Scots made many attempts to regain the fortress. King Edward I of England imprisoned Mary Bruce in a cage hung outside the castle from 1306 to 1310. On 19 February 1314, it was retaken by Sir James Douglas (the \\"Black Douglas\\"), in a night attack. His men clothed in black cloaks were apparently mistaken for cattle. They then used rope and board ladders to climb the walls. King Robert the Bruce ordered the castle demolished by his brother Edward Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and in the words of the Lanercost Chronicle \\"all that beautiful castle the Scots pulled down to the ground, like the other castles that they had succeeded in capturing, lest the English should ever again rule the land by holding the castles.\\" It was recaptured by the English during the Second War of Scottish Independence. The castle was Edward III of England's base of operations during his 1334 winter campaign against the Scots. A Scottish siege in 1417 necessitated repairs. The Scots again besieged Roxburgh in 1460; in the course of the action metal fragments from the explosion of one of his bombards killed King James II of Scotland. However, the Scots stormed Roxburgh, capturing it, and James' queen, Mary of Guelders, had the castle demolished. In 1545, during the war of the Rough Wooing, more accurately known as the Nine Years War, the English garrison commanded by Ralph Bulmer built a rectangular fort on the site at the instigation of the Earl of Hertford. In 1547, Hertford ordered the surveyor William Ridgeway and the Master Carpenter John Revell to build to a brewhouse, using a frame made for Wark Castle. Bulmer complained that Ridgeway's visits were infrequent and works incomplete.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 27, 38. This fort was destroyed in 1550 by the terms of the Treaty of Boulogne. The ruins of Roxburgh Castle stand in the grounds of Floors Castle, the seat of the Duke of Roxburghe. These consist of a large mound, with some small fragments of stone walls, especially on the south side. The 1314 capture of the castle is one of the inspirations of \\"The Three Perils of Man\\" by James Hogg.

The Design District was redeveloped in the early 2000s under the direction of developer Craig Robins, president and CEO of Dacra, and L Real Estate with investment from General Growth Properties. It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, architecture firms, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars. Historically a part of Buena Vista, the Design District is located south of Lemon City (Little Haiti). It is roughly bound by North 36 St (US 27) to the south, North 43rd Street to the north, West First Avenue to the west and Biscayne Boulevard to the east. The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy Wynwood neighborhood to the south, Lemon City (Little Haiti) and the historic 1920s Buena Vista neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy Upper East Side neighborhoods to the east. After decades of falling into disrepair, the Design District has been restored as a destination for the arts, design, and fashion. High-end brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Prada, Saint Laurent and Hermes are located in the Design District as well as restaurants from award-winning chefs like Michael Schwartz and celebrities like Gloria and Emilio Estefan; a public art collection with works from Buckminster Fuller, Marc Newsom and Urs Fischer as well as museums and galleries like the Institute for Contemporary Art, Miami, The de la Cruz Collection of Contemporary Art and Locust Projects. History The area of land that is now the Design District was once a pineapple farm in a neighborhood referred to as Buena Vista. Farm owner, T.V. Moore, built the historic Moore Building in the 1920s for his family furniture business. The Moore Furniture Building was one of the first stores in the U.S. dedicated strictly to furniture. By the 1980s and early-1990s, the Design District had fallen into disrepair, and it wasn't until the late 1990s, and early 2000s, that art and design stores began reopening. Credited to starting the district is Craig Robins, who purchased many run-down buildings in the 18 square block area and persuaded many top designers, such as Alison Spear, Peter Page, Kartell, and Luminaire, as well as furniture and textile designer Holly Hunt to open studios and showrooms in the area. Throughout the 2000s, the Design District continued to grow in popularity, and with heavy public and private investment in the neighborhood, the streets and sidewalks were redone, and new trees were planted. In 2010, Dacra, of which Craig Robins is the founder and CEO, and L Real Estate (now L Catterton) formed a partnership to develop the Design District into a luxury shopping and lifestyle destination featuring prominent architects from around the world and flagship locations of fashion brands like Dior, Hermes and Louis Vuitton. Today, signs and names with the name Buena Vista can still be seen throughout the area such as the Buena Vista Post Office, and Buena Vista School. On 1 August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit the Design District, Wynwood, and Midtown Miami areas to avoid getting the Zika virus. Governor Rick Scott lifted the area's ‚ÄúZika Zone‚Äù designation on September 19, 2016. Shopping Currently, there are over 80 stores open in The District and 70 home design showrooms. The District is home to many flagship luxury stores including Balenciaga, Celine, Christian Louboutin, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, Givenchy, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Prada, Saint Laurent and Tom Ford. The Design District houses one of the highest concentrations of jewelers in the world with jewelers and watchmakers like Bulgari, Cartier, Harry Winston, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger LeCoultre, Tiffany & Co., Van Cleef and Arpels and Vacheron Constantin. Other fashion, beauty, and multibrand stores include beauty and wellness brands Aesop and Creed, plus contemporary brands like French labels Isabel Marant and BA&SH; Scandinavian brand, COS; as well as Rag and Bone, Theory and Alice + Olivia. Design showrooms and stores in the Miami Design District include Citco, Holly Hunt, Jonathan Adler, Luminaire, Minotti, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, Omare, Poltrona Frau and The Rug Company among others. In 2009, Christian Louboutin was the first luxury retailer to open in the design district, marking a new era for the neighborhood. Later that year, Yohji Yamamoto opened in the Design District. In 2011, Louis Vuitton announced plans to open a Louis Vuitton store in the neighborhood by 2014, along with additional storefronts for other brands from the LVMH company including Sephora, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, and Fendi. In October 2011, Hermes, Cartier and Dior announced plans to move their stores from Bal Harbour Shops to the Design District in late 2011 and 2012. Design Within Reach opened an 11,000-square foot design store in the district on Feb 1st, 2013. The three- story, 13,000-square-foot Herm√®s store opened in November 2015 and is only the third U.S. flagship after Madison Avenue in New York City and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, CA.

She was sunk in Naples by bombers of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 4 December 1942. Although salvaged after the war, she was damaged beyond repair and was scrapped. Design Muzio Attendolo was part of the Raimondo Montecuccoli sub-class, which were the third group of Condottieri-class light cruisers. They were larger and better protected than their predecessors. She was built by CRDA Trieste and named after Muzio Attendolo, a 14th-century ruler of Milan and founder of the Sforza dynasty. Career Muzzio Attendolo after being torpedoed by submarine HMS Unbroken Completed in 1935, this ship served in the Mediterranean. During World War II she served in the following actions: * Battle of Punto Stilo * Operation Halberd At the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte, which came about as a British attempt to intercept the resupply of Benghazi, Attendolo was part of the \\"Close covering force\\" for Convoy M42. Sent as part of the planned Italian attack on the British Operation Pedestal in August 1942, the Italian cruiser division which was denied air cover by the Germans was instead withdrawn. Passing through the patrol area of two British submarines, Muzio Attendolo was torpedoed by in the early morning of 13 August. She lost all the hull forward the first turret, but the transversal bulkhead resisted enough to save her from flooding, and the loss of the damaged part lightened the ship herself. She was towed to Messina and Naples and mostly repaired within 3 months. The cruiser , also torpedoed by Unbroken at the same time, had been struck amidships and was not repaired due to a lack of resources. St. Barbara‚Äôs Day bombing Muzio Attendolo was at least theoretically part of the 7th Naval division, together with two other Condottieri-cruisers, and . But the real formidable deterrent was the 1st Squadron, with all three s. All this could have been effective with classical naval warfare, but aircraft power soon changed things drastically, as shown in the Taranto and Naples port attacks (1940‚Äì41). In late December, B-24 Liberator heavy bombers increased their activity over Naples which had become the Italians' most important naval base. Taranto had become too dangerous to harbour major ships, but Naples was still in the range of Liberator and Wellington bombers. On 4 December 1942 (St. Barbara's Day), 20 USAAF B-24s of 98 and 376 Squadrons, based in Egypt and armed with 500 and 1000 lb bombs from , flew to Naples unnoticed. Confused with a formation of Ju 52s, and flying apparently from Vesuvio, they were already over the port before anti-aircraft defences opened fire at 16.40. Coming in from the higher terrain around Vesuvio, the pilots had underestimated the time they would need to spot, identify, and target the most important enemy ships before making course corrections that would most successfully result in hitting their primary targets. Terrestrial structures and other topographic features, from this direction, also served to clutter and confuse the pilots and their bombardiers as they tried to quickly pick out the more important enemy targets in the quickly approaching harbor. The direction and added background clutter may have also served to confuse and slow down the reaction time of the anti-aircraft defense crews who likewise had little time to identify and target the incoming bombers and resulted in these batteries only opening fire once the B-24s were on top of them. The B-24 flight had hoped to find and hit Italian battleships in the harbor. However, the direction of the air-attack had put the B-24s out of position for a bombing run on them. Even though the B-24s current flight path could not be modified enough to effectively strike at the battleships, there were other important ships in the harbor that were more vulnerable, less well defended and within the bombers current flight path. Therefore, the crews of the B-24s set their sights and made their bombing runs on the cruisers of the 7th Division. One bomb nearly missed Eugenio di Savoia, but still caused moderate damage to the aft hull, leaving 17 dead and 46 wounded. Repair work from this \\"near miss\\" was estimated to take 40 days. Raimondo Montecuccoli was hit midships by a bomb just inside the funnel. Although the funnel was reduced to a smoking crater, the armoured grating was sufficient to protect the vital machinery that lay underneath. Even though Raimondo Montecuccoli could have suffered catastrophic damage had the bomb been able to penetrate further and into more vital compartments; her crew still suffered 44 killed and 36 wounded; and the damage to her funnel and supporting structures was sufficient that she would require seven months of repair, before being returned to active duty. Muzio Attendolo was hit in the midship by one or possibly two bombs, between tower 3 and part of her superstructure, cutting off her main power, and effectively taking her out of the fight. The B-24 raid lasted for about an hour, ending around 17:28. Of the three cruisers damaged, Muzio Attendolo had suffered the worst. The air-raid had left Muzio Attendolo with no power, damage below the waterline, flooding, and fierce fires aft. The fires had finally been extinguished when another air-raid alarm was sounded at 21:17, sending repair crews and craft scrambling for cover from the anticipated 2nd wave air-attacks. The impending 2nd air-attack would prove to be a false alarm, and the repair personnel and vessels attending Muzio Attendolo would not return to her aid until over an hour later. During that time, the crippled ship had rolled almost 180 degrees and settled to the bottom at her moorings around 22:19. It is believed that the three light cruisers suffered together at least 188 killed (the total number is unknown) and 86 wounded. One sailor was killed on , and 150 to 250 civilians died as well. Major ships were swiftly moved to La Spezia. Attendolo was still considered repairable with 10 to 12 months estimated, but because of the precipitating events salvage operations did not begin before Italy surrendered. The ship was used as a dock with the Allied occupation; after the war's end, given that the structures of the ship were still in a good condition, it was considered the possibility of salvaging it and transforming it into an anti-aircraft cruiser (to be included in the Navy in the place of the old cruiser ), but the lack of financial means and the fear that the Allied Commission would oppose the proposal, led to Muzio Attendolo being raised and scrapped instead.

It begins at an intersection with NY 5 in the village of Elbridge and ends at a junction with NY 31 in the village of Jordan. The highway is known locally as Jordan Road and Main Street. The route was once part of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road, a plank road established by a New York State Legislature charter in the 1850s. It spanned a short distance from Jordan to the village of Skaneateles and was a successor to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad, which ceased operations in 1834. However, the plank road lasted less than two decades. In 1866, the Legislature granted another charter, this time creating the Skaneateles Railroad and its corporation, which bought out most of the plank road company. The alignment of Route 317 south of Jordan was originally County Route 105 (CR 105), a highway maintained by Onondaga County. The highway paralleled Valley Drive, which was designated as New York State Route 31C in the 1930s and located on the opposite (western) side of Skaneateles Creek. In 2002, heavy flooding of the creek washed out a portion of Valley Drive. A bill to transfer maintenance of most of Valley Drive from the state of New York to local governments in exchange for maintenance of CR 105 was subsequently passed by the New York State Legislature and took effect April 1, 2003, at which time the NY 31C designation was removed. The former CR 105 and the portion of former NY 31C in Jordan were designated as NY 317 at the same time. Route description First northbound reassurance marker on NY 317 NY 317 begins at an intersection with NY 5 (Main Street) and South Street (CR 122) in the Onondaga County village of Elbridge. The route heads northward from the central intersection, passing a small commercial lot to the west and several residential homes to the north and west. Just to the west of the highway is Valley Drive, formerly NY 31C, which parallels NY 317 for its entire length. Separating NY 317 and Valley Drive is Skaneateles Creek, which runs between the two highways. After a short distance in the village, NY 317, known as Jordan Road, continues northwest into the surrounding town of Elbridge, where roadside development ends and the highway passes through predominantly open fields. It loosely parallels Skaneateles Creek, turning slightly northward and northwestward to match curves in the waterway. It is during the latter northwest‚Äìsoutheast stretch that Valley Drive ends at a cul-de-sac amongst the woods that line the creek. NY 317 southbound at the junction of Elbridge and South Main Streets in Jordan A short distance to the northwest, Valley Drive resumes near Crego Road. On NY 317, the highway passes Maple Grove Cemetery, a small graveyard located in Elbridge. After this comes the intersection with Crego Road, one of two connectors between Valley Road and NY 317\\\\. NY 317 then intersects with Whiting Road (CR 183), which heads to the east, before entering the village of Jordan. In Jordan, NY 317 becomes Elbridge Street and turns west to intersect the northern terminus of Valley Drive. The highway proceeds through the southern portion of the village and crosses Skaneateles Creek to reach a junction with South Main Street. NY 317 turns north onto Main Street and has intersections with Mechanic Street (CR 60) and North Hamilton Street (designated as CR 271 south of Jordan) before it terminates at a junction with NY 31 north of the village center but within the village limits. History Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road The modern routing of NY 317 was originally the northern part of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road. Chartered in 1855, the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road Company was set to provide a plank road from Jordan southward to Skaneateles. This plank road was constructed in the 1850s in place of the Syracuse and Auburn Railroad and a small railroad from Skaneateles to Skaneateles Junction, two crude railroads that were in the area which had ended service in 1836 and 1850 respectively. On March 25, 1853, the New York State Assembly proposed an additional toll gate to be constructed in Elbridge along the plank road. On June 15, 1853, the bill was passed by the Legislature and went into effect. Although the plank road company lasted less than two decades, it had its share of controversy. In the January 1853 case of Wilson v. Rochester and Syracuse Railroad Company, Wilson, the plaintiff, was traveling southbound along the plank road through Elbridge. At a grade crossing with railroad tracks, Wilson fell off his horses and wagon upon hitting the tracks. He then fell onto the tracks below and was permanently injured as a result. In 1861, during Jordan & Skaneateles Plank Road Company vs. Morley, the company sued Morley for evading the toll in Elbridge. Morley countered that the road was in disrepair. However, on the plaintiff's side, the toll collector was aware that Morley had passed through the toll gate but took no action to enforce the toll. If Morley had paid, he would have been liable for $62.50 (equivalent to $ in ). On April 17, 1866, the plank road company was bought out by the Skaneateles Railroad Company. The state chartered the bill, the railroad was constructed and tolls were to be collected by the railroad company rather than the plank road company. Designation In 1908, Valley Drive, a narrow, winding road along the western bank of Skaneateles Creek in the town of Elbridge, was included in Route 20, an unsigned legislative route extending from Rochester in the west to Elbridge in the east. The highway was gradually taken over by the state of New York, beginning with the segment between the Elbridge and Jordan village lines. This section of Valley Drive was legislatively designated as part of State Highway 487 (SH 487) and added to the state highway system on November 2, 1908. The portion within Elbridge was included in the state highway system on December 7, 1911, as part of SH 5080\\\\. The Jordan segment was added to the state highway system as part of SH 5630 sometime after 1920. Map showing the alignments of NY 31C and NY 317 and the close proximity of the two highways Valley Drive received its first posted designation in the mid-1920s when it was designated as NY 31A, a spur route of NY 31 that linked NY 31 in Jordan to NY 5 in Elbridge. The designation was short-lived, however, as the route became the northernmost portion of NY 41 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering NY 41 was truncated to its present northern terminus in Skaneateles . Its former routing between Elbridge and Jordan was redesignated as NY 31C. NY 31C remained unchanged until 2002 when part of Valley Drive was washed out by flooding from the nearby creek. A bill (S6534, 2002) was introduced in the New York State Senate on March 18, 2002, that would transfer ownership and maintenance of CR 105, an alternate route between Jordan and Elbridge on the eastern bank of Skaneateles Creek, from Onondaga County to the New York State Department of Transportation and give Valley Drive to the town of Elbridge and the villages of Jordan and Elbridge. S6534 was passed by the State Senate on April 29 and by the Assembly on June 20\\\\. It was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on August 6, 2002, and took effect April 1, 2003. A closed-off bridge that carried Valley Drive (old NY 31C) over Skaneateles Creek. It is scheduled to be demolished in 2014. On April 1, 2003, NY 31C was effectively renumbered to NY 317 and rerouted south of the intersection of Valley Drive and Elbridge Street in Jordan to follow the former CR 105 to Elbridge. The washed-out section of Valley Drive was never repaired, leaving Valley Drive as two separate dead end streets. The New York State Department of Transportation has made plans to remove the bridge carrying Valley Drive (former NY 31C) over Skaneateles Creek in the town of Elbridge. Demolition of the structure is scheduled to begin in mid-2014 and cost $300,000. Once removed, the bridge, built in 1921, will not be replaced.

This species is endemic to Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia. Description The buff-breasted buttonquail measures from and usually weighs over . Both the tail and wings are short. The back is chestnut. The sides of the head are marked with chestnut on an otherwise plain gray head; while the breast is warm buff-colored. The painted buttonquail and the brown quail both coexist with this species. The buff-breasted is larger (and longer-legged) than either and is quite different from the all-dark quail. The painted species is almost totally mottled, with bold white spotting on the breast and no warm buff coloration. The most similar species to the buff-breasted is the chestnut-backed buttonquail, which does not overlap in the wild. The advertising (or booming) call made by the female is ', repeated up to 20 times. The notes are almost inaudible initially, then become gradually louder, higher-pitched and shorter until they are far-carrying. The males will respond with a deep, rapid ' whistle. Other calls, perhaps in reaction to danger, include ', a soft ' and a loud '. Distribution and habitat These birds favor lowland, subcoastal grasslands or woodlands. They may be found at any elevation to . Reports describe this species as dependent on grassy woods made up of Melaleuca, Acacia, Alphitonia and Tristania. They have been seen in area of heavy scrub ground cover, up to high in some cases, but can also be seen in rocky areas where almost no scrub cover is present. Conservation status The buff-breasted buttonquail is an endangered species, with a population estimated at 500 individuals and an historical range of . They have been extirpated from large portions of their original range, probably due in part due to cattle overgrazing, sites made unsuitable by fire regimes and general habitat clearances to make way for human habitation. Important Bird Areas Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for buff-breasted buttonquail conservation are the Iron and McIlwraith Ranges, and the Morehead River of Far North Queensland. Behaviour Very few people see the buff-breasted buttonquail due partially to its tiny range and also due to its inconspicuous disposition. They usually walk or run in areas where they are well camouflaged, almost never leaving the ground except when absolutely needed. They reside in the same areas usually, but local movements have been recorded, probably in response to seasonal habitat changes. Diet Details of their diet are little known, but (like most buttonquail) they probably live off of insects and seeds, with sand used as a digestion aid. Breeding These birds are known to be solitary breeders. The breeding season is January through March. The nest is a shallow depression with a dome of grasses and a side entrance, which itself is lined with grasses and leaves. Usually the nest site is well obscured behind grasses, low scrubs or tussock. Two to four round eggs (usually 3) are laid. The eggs are whitish and speckled with chestnut, bluish- gray or black.

Joan Fontaine makes one of her early (uncredited) film appearances. The screenplay was by Allan Scott, Mortimer Offner, and Jack Townley, based on the 1901 play Quality Street by J. M. Barrie. This 1937 version was filmed at the RKO Encino movie ranch, RKO Forty Acres backlot, and RKO Hollywood Studios. Quality Street was a box office failure, recording a loss of $248,000.Richard Jewel, \\"RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951\\". Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Vol 14 No 1, 1994; p. 44 It was Katharine Hepburn's fourth flop film in a row for RKO Pictures, which added to Miss Hepburn‚Äôs label as \\"box office poison\\" by the 1938 national group of movie exhibitors. Roy Webb's music was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Score. Plot In 1805 England, eligible bachelors are scarce on Quality Street. Twenty-year-old Phoebe Throssel (Hepburn) becomes very hopeful when one of the few, Dr. Valentine Brown (Tone), tells her he has something important to say to her that day. Both she and her older sister Susan believe he will propose. However, he informs her that he has enlisted in the army to fight in the Napoleonic Wars. Phoebe hides her devastation so well that Dr. Brown never suspects she is deeply in love with him. She gives up hope of ever marrying. By contrast, the Throssels' servant Patty, though she is a decade older and aware she is no beauty, is confident that she will get a man. For the next ten years, the Throssels run a school for young boys and girls. Then, with the wars over, Brown returns as a captain. When he comes to invite the sisters to a ball, he is taken aback by how much Phoebe's looks appear to have deteriorated. Hurt by this, Phoebe declines. To lift her spirits, Phoebe sheds her drab everyday clothes and dresses up in a beautiful gown. When Brown returns unexpectedly, Patty thinks quickly and identifies her as Phoebe's niece Livy. Taken in completely, Brown invites her to the ball. She accepts, planning to make him eventually fall in love with her, then when he proposes, reject him. At the ball, she is quickly surrounded by admirers, much to Brown's annoyance. In the days that follow, she flirts with all the men. Finally, at a picnic, Brown draws Livy away to a gazebo when it starts to rain. To her shock, instead of asking for her hand in marriage, he merely lectures her on her behavior and reveals that he is in love with Phoebe. The next day, the Throssels have to fend off their neighbors, the Willougbys, who suspect that Livy and Phoebe are one and the same, particularly elderly Mary Willoughby. When Brown comes calling, the Willoughbys mention their suspicions. He eventually corners Patty and gets the truth from her. With the help of the sergeant who first recruited him, he puts clothes around a large seat cushion and puts \\"Livy\\" in a carriage to return home, all in sight of the snooping neighbors. He tells the sergeant and Patty to get rid of the \\"niece\\" and not to return until much later. The couple are delighted to spend time together. Brown goes inside and embraces Phoebe.

It is one of the longest Mediterranean coastlines in North Africa. The city of Alexandria lies at the center of Egypt's Mediterranean coastline in Lower Egypt (northern Egypt), as chosen by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. The north coast has been the hub of sea travel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Nile Delta for over 2,300 years. Geography and nature On contrast to Egypt's Red Sea Riviera, its Mediterranean coastline is totally plain with low altitude shrublands along the region, except for the westernmost portion which is formed by the 400m-high Marmarika Plateau. It is also characterised by the occurrence of Egypt's five northernmost lakes. The region has typical Mediterranean flora and fauna on land and in marine life with the weather being between pleasant and hot during summer and mild in winter. The region receives the most rain in Egypt, hail and sleet fall rarely in winter. Snowfalls occur in some inland towns and locations. Climate Even though most of Egypt lies within the hot desert climate (BWh) according to K√∂ppen climate classification with little precipitation, prevailing winds from the Mediterranean sea greatly moderate the temperatures of the northern coastal line, making the summers moderately hot and humid, while the winters moderately wet and mild, when sleet and hail are also common, in and around the wettest places, as Alexandria. Temperatures range between a minimum monthly average of in winter and in summer, while a maximum monthly average of in winter and in summer. Cities, towns and villages Egypt's Mediterranean coast can be differentiated into 4 subregions: * Western North Coast: Which has higher rain precipitation. Higher altitude witnesses higher snowfalls and it is colder than the other 3 portions. It also has more shrubbed and forested terrain, but no lakes. This subregion faces Greece and Crete. It has cities, towns and villages such as: ** Sallum a border town at Libyan borders. ** Baqiqi a fishing local village. ** Sidi Barrani a snowy town, and Egypt's closest inhabited settlement towards Europe and Greece. ** Shammas a fishing local village. ** Zawyet Umm El Rakham a village with archeological sites. ** Marsa Matruh the main seaport on Egypt's Western Mediterranean coast. ** Fuka a village famous for excellent Mediterranean fruits and touristic beaches. ** El Dabaa is a main town ** Sidi Abdel Rahman a new touristic seaport town with a number of leading resorts like Hacienda bay and white, Marassi (made by Emaar), Lazorde and Diplo. * Central North Coast: The southernmost Mediterranean shoreline in Egypt, forming a big gulf. It has no lakes. This subregion faces the West of Turkey. It has cities, towns and villages such as: ** El Alamein the southernmost Mediterranean coastal city ** Marina, Egypt a leading Egyptian major resorts town, and host site of Ancient Egyptian and Roman monuments. ** Sidi Kreir a major town and municipality ** Borg El Arab a major city ** Alexandria the main Mediterranean city and seaport. At the center of the entire Medi coastline and the second largest city in Egypt. * Delta's North Coast: Which is settled by larger populations and hosts larger cities, with the exception of Alexandria. It has the Nile Delta which features hail and sleet in winters. Sometime frost and frozen ground during winter nights destroy the crops and agriculture plants. Three of Egypt's Northern Lakes are located there: Lake Mariout, Edko Lake and Lake Burullus. This subregion faces Central Turkey. Its cities, towns and villages are: ** Rosetta a historic western Nile delta city where Rashid's Nile branch and Mediterranean meet (aka Rashid) ** Baltim at the northern tip of the Nile Delta. One of North Africa's northern towns ** Gamasa a local touristic city ** Ras El Bar a touristic city for locals where the Damietta's Nile branch and the Mediterranean meet ** Ezbet El Borg is a fishing city at the other bank of the Damietta River ** Damietta a major eastern Nile Delta city and seaport in Egypt * Eastern North Coast: It has the least precipitation, yet its cities and towns are of great geopolitical and economic importance. It is colder on its eastern part than its other part. 2 Northern lakes of Egypt are found in this subregion as well: Lake Manzala and Lake Bardawil. This subregion faces Cyprus and Turkey. It has cities, towns and villages like: ** Port Said a European styled-city, entrance to Suez Canal and Egypt's major eastern seaport ** Arish major east seaport on Arish river and Arish valley ** Rafah Egypt's last eastern Mediterranean city on the borders with Gaza Strip.

He is often regarded as one of the most popular and well known Polish vocalist, along with an occasional collaborator Czes≈Çaw Niemen. Riedel's legacy is remembered by an annual festival, bearing his name, held in his home town of Chorz√≥w, which was moved from Tychy in 2009. He has become one of the most powerful vocalist of Polish music just after Czes≈Çaw Niemen.  Biography  Ryszard Henryk Riedel was born on 7 September 1956 in Chorz√≥w. He was the second child of Krystyna and Jan Riedel‚Äîhis sister Ma≈Çgorzata is one year older. He finished his education after the 7th grade of primary school. He was a self-taught vocalist and he had never attended a singing course. His wide musical influences included bands like Free (Paul Rodgers was Riedel\`s favourite vocalist), and later, Bad Company, Cream, The Allman Brothers Band, and The Doors. At the beginning of his career he was asked to join Kombi, but he turned down the offer. In December 1973, at the age of 17, he joined D≈ºem. During the band's initial years he was instrumental in keeping it together. His lyrics contained many autobiographical pieces, because he used his life as the inspiration for many, if not all, of his songs. Throughout his career he collaborated with many Polish artists: Rysiek Skibi≈Ñski, Leszek Winder, J√≥zef Skrzek, and bands Nocna Zmiana Bluesa, to name a few. In the later years of his singing career he became a heavy drug user (mainly heroin), which led to numerous arguments within the band, and subsequently resulted in Ryszard living his life as an outsider: he skipped rehearsals many times, and even managed not to show up for his concerts. This lifestyle was the inspiration for the 1993 song \\"Autsajder\\" (Outsider), in which he states that he will never change: \\"Ja ju≈º nigdy siƒô nie zmieniƒô\\" Despite his deteriorating health condition, the band continued to collaborate with him until he was forced to attend another failed drug detoxification (detox) campaign in 1994. His last Concert with the band \\"D≈ºem\\" was on 16 March 1994 in Krak√≥w.  Death  Riedel's direct cause of death was cardiac insufficiency due to a long time opiate drug abuse ‚Äî especially a type of crude-prepared heroin known as \\"kompot\\".  Legacy  Rysiek (diminutive of Ryszard) Riedel is celebrated as one of the best all- time singers in Polish musical history. The Rolling Stone magazine has described him as \\"the last hippie of our time\\".  Musical events  * \\"List Do R\\" (29 July 1995, a year after his death) - in memoriam show held in Katowice's concert hall Spodek, with many performances of prominent Polish vocalists, including Czes≈Çaw Niemen. The name is a paraphrase of Ryszard Riedel's song - \\"List Do M\\" - \\"A letter to M\\". * Festiwal Muzyczny im. Ry≈õka Riedla ‚ÄûKu Przestrodze‚Äù (1999-2014) - annual festival held in Tychy (until 2008) and later Chorz√≥w.

It extends for in a northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction from an intersection with the concurrent routes of NY 13, NY 34, and NY 96 in the town of Ithaca to a junction with NY 79 in the town of Enfield. NY 327 runs along the northern edge of Robert H. Treman State Park as it passes from Ithaca to Enfield. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description NY 327 through the hamlet of Enfield NY 327 begins at an intersection with NY 13, NY 34 and NY 96 (Elmira Road) in the town of Ithaca. Although the route is signed as a north‚Äìsouth highway, it initially heads southwest along the two- lane Enfield Falls Road toward Robert H. Treman State Park. The highway connects to the park's northeast entrance before bending northwest and rising in elevation as it heads through a wooded area north of the park. NY 327 soon crosses into the town of Enfield, where it continues to wind its way westward along the edge of Treman State Park. The route connects to the park's northwest entrance before heading away from the park on a northwestward alignment. NY 327 maintains the northwesterly track for about to a junction with County Route 133 (CR 133, named Trumbulls Corners Road), where the highway finally makes a bend to the north. Past CR 133, the route's rural surroundings give way to residential portions of Enfield, including the hamlet of Bostwick Corners. Here, the highway becomes known as Enfield Main Road, and the new name follows NY 327 along a sparsely populated stretch to the hamlet of Enfield to the north. North of Enfield, NY 327 runs past a line of homes that follows the highway to a junction with NY 79 (Mecklenburg Road). NY 327 ends here while the road's right-of-way continues north to NY 96 in Ulysses as CR 170 (Halseyville Road). History The portion of NY 327 north of the hamlet of Enfield was originally improved to state highway standards as part of a contract awarded by the state of New York on April 27, 1912. It was added to the state highway system on August 10, 1915, as part of unsigned State Highway 1001 (SH 1001). The remainder of modern NY 327 was rebuilt under a project let by the state on October 19, 1914, and accepted into the state highway system on October 19, 1918, as SH 1189. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. SH 1189 and the piece of SH 1001 between Enfield and NY 79 became NY 327, and the route's alignment has not been substantially altered since.

Design Duca d'Aosta was the namesake of the fourth subclass of Condottieri light cruisers. The design of the Duca d'Aostas derived from the preceding Montecuccoli class, with a slight increase in size and a significant increase in armour. The machinery was also re-arranged. Duca d'Aosta was built by OTO, Livorno and was named after Emanuele Filiberto, 2nd Duke of Aosta, an Italian Field Marshal of World War I. Career The ship joined the 7th Cruiser Division and in 1938 departed on a circumnavigation with her sister- ship, . The deteriorating world political situation caused this to be cut short after visits to the Caribbean and South America, and the ships returned La Spezia in March 1939. World War II At the Italian entry into the war, d'Aosta was part of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and participated in the Battle of Punta Stilo between 6-10 July. In addition, she protected North Africa convoys, took part in a fleet sortie against British cruisers and bombarded Corfu on 18 December. During 1941, d'Aosta served mostly with the 8th Cruiser Division, laying minefields off North Africa and protecting convoys. One of the convoy duties, in December, led to the First Battle of Sirte, in which d'Aosta took part. Her duties in 1942 were much as before, but with aggressive actions against Allied convoys, including the Operations Harpoon and Vigorous, in June, to resupply the British controlled island of Malta.

Allied service After the Italian Armistice, d'Aosta had a minor refit at Taranto and in October 1943, with the cruisers and , she sailed to the South Atlantic, to serve with the Allies on shipping blockade duties, based at Freetown. There were seven patrols between November 1943 and February 1944; she returned to Italy in April and, thereafter, was used only for transport. Postwar After the war, d'Aosta was inactive. On 2 March 1949, transferred to the Soviet Union as Z15.

It is produced on traditional paper and paste-the-wall substrates. Analglypta is often compared to Lincrusta which is made from gelled paste of linseed oil and wood flour. Lincrusta is considered to be a heavier version but more durable than Analglypta.  Origin and history  The development of Anaglypta can be traced back to the invention of Lincrusta in 1877 by Frederick Walton.History of Anaglypta It became an instant success because it was the first washable wallcovering and appealed to the Victorians because of its sanitary properties as well as its durability and ornate effects. Originally made on a linen backing it was, however, quite rigid. Because of this, an employee called Thomas John Palmer invented a similar product which, being made from wood pulp and cotton, was lighter and more flexible. This was to become Anaglypta, from the Greek words (, 'raised') and (, 'cameo'). Seeing this as a threat to Lincrusta, Walton decided not to develop it; Palmer patented the product, parted from Walton, and moved to Lancaster. There he began production of Anaglypta in partnership with Storey Bros. in 1887. The partnership was ordered to be dissolved in 1893 by the courts, following a dispute concerning profit sharing. Anaglypta and Lincrusta came together again in 1931 when they were merged to form the Relief Decorations branch of Wallpaper Manufacturers (WPM) and manufactured in Darwen, Lancashire. After a period of stability Relief Decorations was sold to Reed International in the 1960s and with considerable investment the first duplex product made entirely of wood pulp was launched; this is now marketed as Anaglypta Original.

Originally the room where the king's clothes, armour, and treasure were stored, the term was expanded to describe both its contents and the department of clerks who ran it. Early in the reign of Henry III the Wardrobe emerged out of the fragmentation of the Curia Regis to become the chief administrative and accounting department of the Household. The Wardrobe received regular block grants from the Exchequer for much of its history; in addition, however, the wardrobe treasure of gold and jewels enabled the king to make secret and rapid payments to fund his diplomatic and military operations, and for a time, in the 13th-14th centuries, it eclipsed the Exchequer as the chief spending department of central government. There were in fact two main Wardrobes for much of this period: around 1300 the confusingly-named Great Wardrobe, responsible only for expenditure on such things as clothing, textiles, furs and spices, split away from the more senior Wardrobe, which remained responsible for financing the king's personal expenditure and his military operations. In addition there were smaller Privy Wardrobes at various royal palaces; most of these provided items for the personal use of the King when in residence, but the Privy Wardrobe in the Tower of London came to specialize in the storage and manufacture of armour and armaments, and as such it too developed into an autonomous department of the State. By the 15th century the Wardrobe had lost much of its earlier influence, and it eventually merged entirely into the Household and lost its separate identity. At the same time, the Great Wardrobe began to be referred to, more simply, as \\"the Wardrobe\\", to some extent taking on the identity of its forebear; but in the sixteenth century the Great Wardrobe lost its independence (it continued in existence as a subsidiary department within the Royal Household until it was abolished by the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782). The King's (or Household) Wardrobe Origins and early development King Eadred, AD 951‚Äì955, with bequests to hr√¶gl√∞ene (robe-keepers) (15th-century copy, British Library Add MS 82931, ff. 22r‚Äì23r)Charter S 1515 at the Electronic Sawyer In the Middle Ages persons of wealth and power often slept in a chamber (Latin camera), alongside which a secure room or wardrobe (garderoba) would be provided for storage of clothes and other valuables. In the royal household, the Chamber came to represent the king's nearest advisers. Before long the Wardrobe emerged, under the auspices of the Chamber, to become an administrative body in its own right, providing secure storage for the robes, treasures, archives and armaments of the king. Like other offices of the household it was an itinerant operation: carts and cases containing valuables travelled with the King and his court as they moved from place to place around the realm. Prior to the 13th century references to the Wardrobe and its keepers are few. The 10th-century King Eadred bequeathed substantial sums of money in his will to his hr≈ìgelthegns (robe-keepers), which may suggest that these were persons of some importance. By the reign of Henry II the king's Wardrobe is identified as a 'place of safe deposit' with its own staff, and its own premises within various royal palaces or strongholds; there remained, however, a good deal of functional overlap between the Chamber and the Wardrobe. The rise of the Wardrobe After 1200, however, the Wardrobe grew in activity and in prestige, partly as a result of King John's constant travelling of the realm, which required a more immediate source of funds than the fixed Exchequer.R. Wickson, The Community of the Realm in 13thC England (London 1970) p. 27 The Wardrobe first rivalled, and then eclipsed the Chamber in terms of power within the Court and in relation to the governance of the realm. Thus we see, early in the reign of Henry III, the office of Treasurer of the Chamber annexed to (and taken over by) that of Keeper of the Wardrobe. At around the same time the Keeper's deputy (the Controller of the Wardrobe) was given oversight of the Privy Seal (which had first come into use within the Chamber). This meant that the Wardrobe, which already served as a repository of important documents and Charters, began producing them as well; and thenceforward its Controller tended to be an important and trusted adviser to the king. With these developments, a third official, the Cofferer of the Wardrobe, began to take increasing responsibility for the day-to-day business of the Wardrobe. The administrative historian T. F. Tout has speculated that a reason for the Wardrobe's increasing influence was its \\"new and elastic\\" nature: it was not hidebound by restrictive traditions or customary ways of working. Moreover, it was able to respond quickly in times when speedy expenditure was required ‚Äì most especially in time of war ‚Äì and with a flexibility which suited both the monarch and the nascent powers of English government. It did so largely by securing loans, on the basis of its valuable assets and treasures, from Italian bankers (the Riccardi and the Frescobaldi). In this way the Wardrobe became an independently powerful financial office. There was however also a political dimension to the Wardrobe's rise. As G. M. Trevelyan put it, \\"If one office‚Ä¶was secured by the baronial opposition, the King could dive underground and still govern the country through the Wardrobe\\":G M Trevelyan, History of England (London 1926) p. 198-9 hence the baronial demand in 1258 that all money should in future go through the Exchequer.S H Steinberg ed., A New Dictionary of British History (London 1963) p. 383 During the reign of Edward I, the Wardrobe was at the height of its power as a financial, administrative and military department of the Household and State. It was \\"the brain and hand of the Court\\". Its seal, the Privy Seal, no longer functioned solely as the personal seal of the King, but began to serve as a second, and somewhat less formal, State seal alongside the Great Seal of the Realm. (The fact that the Privy Seal invariably travelled with the King and his Court often made it quicker and easier to use than the Great Seal, which remained in the custody of the Chancellor). It was by letters authenticated by this seal that officials across the Kingdom received their instructions, as did both the Exchequer and the Chancery (the two main offices of State outside the Household); those serving in the armed forces were paid through the Wardrobe accounts. The Keeper or Treasurer of the Wardrobe was considered (alongside the Steward) to be one of the two chief officers of the Household at this time. The Wardrobe was still at this point an itinerant operation, but it did maintain two permanent 'Treasuries': one in the Tower of London (forerunner of the Great Wardrobe ‚Äì see below), and one in the crypt of the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey. It was the latter that served as the main repository for the royal jewels, plate, coin and bullion through the 13th century; but, following the burglary of the contents of this Treasury in 1303 by a certain Richard Pudlicott (who was assisted by some of the abbey's monks), the bulk of the remaining treasure was removed to the Tower (including items of coronation regalia, such as are still stored at the Tower to this day). Its influence fades Toward the end of Edward's reign, a series of costly wars took their toll on the Wardrobe's hitherto independent means. Then, during the reign of Edward II, concerted efforts were made to reassert traditional rights of the Chancery and the Exchequer, and to limit the authority of the Wardrobe. For example, 1307 saw a separate Keeper of the Privy Seal appointed; over the next few decades the Privy Seal developed into a minor office of state, operating alongside the Office of Chancery, outside both Wardrobe and Household. Then in 1311 a series of Ordinances were issued by barons opposed to the King, a number of which reasserted the status quo ante over recent Wardrobe innovations; for example, ordinance 8 insisted that the Exchequer alone was to receive taxes and other state revenue. Later, under Edward III, any ongoing conflicts over the confusion of authority between the wardrobe and the exchequer were finally resolved when William Edington, Treasurer in the mid- fourteenth century, effected a number of reforms which brought the Wardrobe firmly under the financial oversight of the Exchequer. It was around this time that the Wardrobe began to be known as the Household Wardrobe: this was in part to differentiate it from the increasingly autonomous 'Great Wardrobe' (see below), but it also reflects the fact that the wardrobe was by now losing its wider influence. In England, its business was restricted now to Household administration; and although it retained greater influence when accompanying the King and Court overseas, it did so only as a subsidiary arm of the Exchequer. (Likewise at times of war it remained an important source of funds but operated under the authority of the Exchequer, in contrast to earlier times when it had functioned as a largely independent 'war treasury'; the Battle of Cr√©cy and its aftermath was the last period of military campaigning for which the Wardrobe itself provided significant funds.) With the Wardrobe under increasing scrutiny, the King began to look to the erstwhile-dormant Chamber as providing a more effective structure for overseeing his personal administration and finances. It is there that the beginnings of a privy purse are seen under Edward II, alongside a 'secret seal' which the King now used for personal correspondence in place of the Privy Seal; and under Edward II and Edward III the chief Chamberlain began to re-emerge as a key person of influence within the Household. By the reign of Richard II, the Chamber had re-established its seniority within the Household, and the Wardrobe then 'ceased to be the directive force of the household, remaining simply as the office of household accounts'. Rather than being a separate department, the Wardrobe and its officers now came under the authority of the Steward, and before long, even within the Household, the Wardrobe began to lose its separate identity: by the late 14th century, its senior officers were more often than not referred to as the Treasurer of the Household, Controller of the Household and Cofferer of the Household (rather than as \\"Treasurer/Controller/Cofferer of the Household Wardrobe\\"). Despite this gradual demise of the Wardrobe, these three officers remained (and two of them still remain) as senior officers of the Household who are also members of the Government. A vestige of the Wardrobe's former significance is seen in the 15th century, when in time of conflict the Treasurer of the Household was also frequently appointed 'Treasurer of Wars'. Emergence of the Great Wardrobe Wardrobe Place in the City of London, built on the site of the Great Wardrobe In the course of the 13th century a distinct organisation began to be identified within the Wardrobe: it came to be known (rather confusingly) as the Great Wardrobe (the word 'Great' referring perhaps to the size of items being stored, not to the importance of the office). Origin and purpose The Great Wardrobe dealt with a variety of commodities ranging from cloth, tapestries, clothing, and furniture to sugar, spices, dried fruit, and pepper; and it later became a repository (and indeed manufactory) of jewellery and other treasures, tents, saddles, bridles, armour, and other military items. What all these items had in common was that they were more or less non- perishable and could be stored long-term if not required for immediate use; the Great Wardrobe originated as the department of the King's Wardrobe which was primarily concerned with the storage of such items when not required by the itinerant Court. Part of its distinctiveness, from an early date, was its employment of city merchants and specialist craftsmen, who better knew the particulars of these commodities than did the Wardrobe clerks. Establishment in the 13th century The term Great Wardrobe (magna garderoba) first appears in 1253. The older Wardrobe had, by this time, developed into a sophisticated bureaucratic and financial office, and its staff had less time (or inclination) to be occupied with the day-to-day matters of storekeeping. Nevertheless, storekeeping remained a practical necessity as the Wardrobe, along with the rest of the royal household, continued to travel with the King as part of his Court, accompanied by the goods and chattels for which it was responsible. It clearly made sense for at least some of these items to be kept in a more settled location. The 'Great Wardrobe' was the name given to this more centralised system of storage; initially, however, there was no single Great Wardrobe location. A majority of items were stored in the Tower of London (London having proved to be the most convenient point of distribution), but others were stored elsewhere according to where they might be needed: indeed, several palaces and castles had their own Great Wardrobe storerooms (some of these were designed for storage of specific items, being located close to a place of specialized manufacture or trade; for example, the Prior of St Ives was required to maintain a storehouse for items purchased by the Wardrobe from the famous cloth market at nearby St Ives, Cambridgeshire.) Throughout the 13th century the Great Wardrobe remained a subsidiary operation within the more senior Wardrobe; and despite the above- mentioned moves toward greater centralisation, the officers of the Great Wardrobe continued to travel with the Court at this time. If the King was due to stay in a place for any length of time (or, indeed, if he was engaged on a military campaign at home or abroad) it remained necessary for many of the Great Wardrobe's items to be transported with him in long convoys of wagons (described in the wardrobe accounts as \\"caravans\\"). Diversification in the 14th century By the fourteenth century the Great Wardrobe had branched into manufacturing (in addition to its duties of purchase, storage and distribution of non-perishable goods) and numbered the King's Tailor, Armourer, Pavilioner and Confectioner among its officials. Nevertheless, it still remained in essence a sub-department of the Household Wardrobe up until 1324, whereupon it gained significant autonomy by being made accountable to the Exchequer rather than to the Wardrobe of the Household. It also began to travel less with the King's Court, and, significantly, began to put down roots outside the Tower in the City of London (its staff necessarily had regular dealings with the City's merchants). This was in part due to lack of space: the Tower was becoming a specialist store and manufacturing base for arms and armour (responsibility for which soon devolved upon a new branch, the Privy Wardrobe ‚Äì see below). Arms and armour remained at the Tower, as did the royal jewels and other valuable items, but much else was moved out. From around 1300 the Great Wardrobe had begun to rent properties in the City to provide extra storage and office space. It made use of a series of properties, including in Bassishaw and in Lombard Street, all the while retaining foothold in the Tower. Then, in 1362 it obtained a more suitable property (which itself became known as The Wardrobe) to the north of Baynard's Castle; and there it was to remain for the next three centuries. The property, a mansion set in its own grounds, which had formerly belonged to Sir John de Beauchamp, provided not only storage, office and meeting rooms, but lodgings for staff, a residence for the Keeper and space for several small manufactories. The nearby parish church is known to this day as St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe. With its permanent establishment in these headquarters, the Great Wardrobe may be considered to have become less a part of the King's Household and more \\"a small, self-contained government office\\". Emergence of the Privy Wardrobe The Jewel Tower housed a branch of the King's Privy Wardrobe at the Palace of Westminster Mention is made of a Privy Wardrobe (parva garderoba) from the 1220s onwards. To begin with, the phrase appears to indicate a room (or type of room) used to store the King's robes, armour and arms. By the end of the 13th century, the same phrase clearly refers to a small organisation headed by a Clerk, within the main Wardrobe, which would travel with the Court and furnish the king with these and other personal items. The itinerant Privy Wardrobe continued to operate and to provide for the King on his travels, even when the Court as a whole had ceased to be mobile (it was later known as the Removing Wardrobe). The central Privy Wardrobe at the Tower of London, however, took on a new identity, and rose in prominence and power, becoming the main official repository and provider of arms, armour and ordnance in the Kingdom of England. Specialisation of the Privy Wardrobe at the Tower By the 14th century, the Tower of London had become well established as a convenient and safe place for storage of arms and armour, jewels and plate; so when the Great Wardrobe departed these items stayed put. Arms had been manufactured within the Tower since the previous century; the local wardrobe staff had valuable experience and the Tower itself was strategically well-placed for fast distribution. Already in the 1330s, prior to the departure of the Great Wardrobe, the local 'Privy Wardrobe at the Tower' had begun to specialize in this work, and after 1361 it, in turn, took on a degree of financial and administrative independence (becoming directly accountable to the Exchequer rather than the royal household). It was superseded in the mid-15th century by the Office of Armoury and the Office of Ordnance (both also based at the Tower), whereupon the Privy Wardrobe's funding ceased and it largely faded from influence (though it continued to have a nominal role until the latter part of the same century). Other wardrobes Building known as The Wardrobe on the site of Richmond Palace Other members of the Royal Family had their own separate wardrobes, which (like the King's Wardrobe) were departments staffed by clerks. The first known Queen's Wardrobe was that of Eleanor of Provence (consort of Henry III); her Wardrobe had a high degree of autonomy, and accounted directly to the Exchequer; later Queens' Wardrobes were more likely to be subsidiary departments of the King's Wardrobe. A Prince's Wardrobe was established for Edward of Caernarfon (the future Edward II) and for other children of the sovereign over successive reigns. Furthermore, several Peers, Bishops and others set up and maintained their own personal Wardrobes along similar lines to that of the monarch in the 13th-15th centuries; the wardrobe accounts of some reveal levels of household (and military) expenditure to rival that of contemporary royalty. In the later 14th century, when the King's court was less mobile, several small separate Wardrobes were established in castles or palaces used by the Royal Family, each with their own keeper. A 16th-century Household inventory from the reign of Edward VI lists thirteen such local wardrobes, along with a distinct 'Wardrobe of Robes' (garderoba robarum), the Removing Wardrobe (see Privy Wardrobe above), and the still- extant Great Wardrobe. Lists of the Chief Officers of the Wardrobe The (Household) Wardrobe Clerk, Keeper or Treasurer of the Wardrobe The chief officer of the Wardrobe was initially termed Clerk of the Wardrobe. The first known clericus de garderoba was one Odo in the reign of King John, who oversaw a small department of carters (to handle the carts), sumpters (to handle the horses), porters (to handle the goods) and other workers. As the Wardrobe grew, both in size and sophistication, a larger number of clerks (who were clergy skilled in administration) were employed, and the chief official came to be distinguished with the title of Keeper of the Wardrobe. From 1232, when the post of Treasurer of the Chamber was merged into the keepership, the terms Keeper, Treasurer and (still) Clerk were used more or less interchangeably; but in the reign of Edward II Treasurer of the Wardrobe emerged as the preferred title. As such, according to an ordinance of 1279, he had charge of the King's expenses (and those of his family), was entrusted with receipt of all money, jewels and presents made to the King, and was responsible for keeping a daily account of all transactions of the Household. Controller of the Wardrobe The primary responsibility of the Controller of the Wardrobe was to check and control the Keeper/Treasurer's expenditure by keeping a counter roll of the Wardrobe accounts; he went on to have responsibility for checking financial compliance and quality control across various departments of the Household. The office dates from the 1230s. The Controller also had charge of the Wardrobe's archive of state documents, which gave his office a distinctively secretarial flavour. Under Edward I the Controller was custodian of the Privy Seal and functioned as the King's private secretary; meanwhile his small department of clerks played a key part in the administrative oversight of the entire Household. By the end of the reign of Edward III this important court official was known as Controller of the Household. Cofferer of the Wardrobe The office of Cofferer of the Wardrobe originated in the late 13th century when the Treasurer/Keeper's chief clerk took on particular responsibility for drafting the Wardrobe accounts. Working closely with the Treasurer, the Cofferer usually served as locum tenens when the Treasurer was otherwise engaged with affairs of state (as was often the case); thus the Cofferer came to be seen as, in effect, the working head of the Wardrobe, acting on the Treasurer's behalf. In his own right he oversaw a small accounting office, staffed by the 'clerks of the Cofferer', who went on to play a key role in the financial oversight of the Household; this was a precursor to the Board of Green Cloth). The Great Wardrobe As early as the 1220s certain persons are identified as having a specialised role as 'buyer' or 'purveyor' within the King's Wardrobe, and keeping their own accounts. Often the King's tailor had this task (which involved purchase of silk, cloth, furs and the like for robes). A Household Ordinance of 1279 formalised the arrangement, ordaining that the Treasurer (Keeper) of the Wardrobe should appoint a man to buy all items appertaining to the Great Wardrobe, \\"and let this man be Keeper of the Great Wardrobe\\". By the 16th century the department had gained a great deal of independence, and its keeper began to be styled Master of the Great Wardrobe. Keepers and Masters of the Great Wardrobe The post was abolished with the other offices of the Great Wardrobe in 1782. Deputy Masters of the Great Wardrobe The Deputy Master of the Great Wardrobe was a position in the British Royal Household, the chief subordinate to the Master of the Great Wardrobe. Holders enjoyed a salary of ¬£200 (fixed in 1674), reduced to ¬£150 in 1761. The post seems to have developed into a sinecure, and by 1765, the office of Assistant to the Deputy Master had become established. The post was abolished with the other offices of the Great Wardrobe in 1782. Others Keepers of the Privy Wardrobe In July 1323, John Fleet was appointed 'Keeper of the part of the King's Wardrobe in the Tower of London'. This, apparently the first such appointment, marked a key stage in the development of the Privy Wardrobe there into a repository and manufactory of arms, armour and artillery. No further appointments were made to this office after 1476.

It tests negative for cytochrome, oxidase, and catalase, and positive for alpha-hemolytic activity. It is non-motile and does not form endospores. S. thermophilus is fimbriated. It is also classified as a lactic acid bacterium. S. thermophilus is found in fermented milk products, and is generally used in the production of yogurt, alongside Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The two species are synergistic, and S. thermophilus probably provides L. d. bulgaricus with folic acid and formic acid which it uses for purine synthesis. S. thermophilus has an optimal growth temperature range of 35 - 42 ¬∞C while L. d. bulgaricus has an optimal range of 43 - 46 ¬∞C.https://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(86)80701-9/pdf  Classification  At least 26 strains of S. thermophilus have been identified and had their genomes sequenced.  Uses  S. thermophilus is one of the most widely used bacteria in the dairy industry. USDA statistics from 1998 showed that more than 1.02 billion kilograms of mozzarella cheese and 621 million kilograms of yogurt were produced from S. thermophilus. Although its genus, Streptococcus, includes some pathogenic species, food industries consider S. thermophilus a safer bacterium than many other Streptococcus species. In fact, yogurt and cheese that contain live cultures of S. thermophilus are thought to be beneficial to health.Taylor, John R. and Mitchell, Deborah. The Wonder of Probiotics. New York, NY: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2007. Live cultures of S. thermophilus make it easier for people who are lactose intolerant to digest dairy products. The bacteria break down lactose, the sugar in milk, that lactose-intolerant people find difficult to digest.  Yogurt production  As early as the 1900s, S. thermophilus has been used to make yogurt. Its purpose is to turn lactose, the sugar in milk, into lactic acid. The increase in lactic acid turns milk into the gel-like structure characteristic of yogurt.  Nomenclature  \\"Streptococcus\\" derives from a Greek term meaning \\"twisted berry\\" and refers to the way the bacterium is grouped in chains that resemble a string of beads.\\"Streptococcus.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 13 April 2011. \\"Thermophilus\\" derives from the Greek thermƒì, meaning \\"heat\\". It refers to an organism's ability to thrive at high temperatures.\\"Thermophile.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. Web. 24 April 2011.  Research   Pathogenic potential  The genus Streptococcus includes several pathogenic species, such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, but food industries consider S. thermophilus non-pathogenic. S. thermophilus is believed to have developed separately from pathogenic Streptococcus species for at least 3000 years. Research teams have sequenced the genome of two strains of S. thermophilus, CNRZ1066 and LMG13811, and stated that the bacteria are not dangerous.\\"Streptococcus Thermophilus: A Bacterium Which Is Harmless to Health.\\" International Research Associates. 14 November 2006. Web. 25 April 2011.  Adjuvant  S. thermophilus strain Orla-Jensen 1919 is a constituent in VSL#3. This standardized formulation of live bacteria may be used in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis. The use of the S. thermophilus-containing VSL#3 may reduce inflammation in mice.  Reduced-fat cheese  S. thermophilus helps make reduced-fat cheese with similar characteristics to regular, full-fat cheese. In the experiment, two different strains of bacteria are used to make reduced-fat cheddar cheese: a strain of Lactococcus lactis and a strain of S. thermophilus. These bacteria are chosen because they produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) which give reduced-fat cheese a texture and flavor like that of regular cheese. L. lactis produces cheese with higher moisture levels compared to other reduced-fat cheeses; S. thermophilus produces cheese with a lower moisture content and a less bitter taste. It was concluded that applying both L. lactis and S. thermophilus strains would create higher quality reduced-fat cheese with characteristics like those of regular cheese.  Cancer Chemotherapy often causes mucositis, severe inflammation of primarily the small intestines. Currently, there is no treatment to alleviate the symptoms of mucositis caused by chemotherapy. When rats were inflicted with mucositis by chemotherapy drugs, the intestinal tissues in those pretreated with streptococcus thermophilus TH-4 functioned more healthily and were less distressed.  Antibiotic- associated diarrhea  Strains of S. thermophilus have also reduced risks of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), an issue that results from taking antibiotics. Antibiotics can have the adverse effect of destroying beneficial bacteria and causing harmful bacteria to multiply, which invokes AAD. Adults who ate yogurt containing S. thermophilus while being treated with antibiotics had lower rates of AAD than the control group (12.4% vs. 23.7%).  Health concerns  Although probiotics, in general, are considered safe, there are concerns about their use in certain cases. Some people, such as those with compromised immune systems, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, heart valve disease and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events. Rarely, the use of probiotics has caused sepsis in children with lowered immune systems or in those who are already critically ill.

He first appeared in Digitek #1 (Dec. 1992), the first issue of a limited series published by Marvel UK. The strip was also published in Marvel UK's weekly anthology title Overkill. The character was created by writers John Tomlinson & Andy Lanning and artist Dermot Power. Publication history Digitek was initially published in two different formats - as a four issue limited series, using the standard Marvel Comics format, and as one of the strips in the UK anthology Overkill (published in a format similar to that of 2000 AD. The inside front covers of the limited series featured 'in-universe' text pieces (such as memos from the fictional Nakasoni Corporation) that established links between Digitek and the other Marvel UK titles (such as Warheads and Genetix) - these documents were not reprinted in the Overkill anthology. At the time, this was a standard publication method for Marvel UK, with the intention that Overkill would be better suited to the UK market, whereas the 'standard' Marvel format would be better suited to comic shops in other countries. As with most of the other Marvel UK titles, Digitek also attempted to attract existing Marvel Comics fans by including a prominent Marvel character in the initial storyline - the cyborg Deathlok. After the initial limited series, Digitek made no further appearances in Marvel UK comics (and within a couple of years, the Marvel UK line of comics had ceased publication) - the character made no other actual appearances until 2009, though he was mentioned by Robbie Baldwin during the Civil War event and in referred to by a character in Captain Britain and MI13. He also received an entry in the most recent Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe. The final issue of Captain Britain and MI13 included a cameo appearance by Digitek, confirming that he is working as a reserve agent for MI:13. Fictional character biography The story of Digitek begins at the Mys-Tech organization. Kether Troop, a team of Mys-Tech mercenaries tasked with recovering alien technology from alternate dimensions, manage to retrieve a product called Protosilicon from an unknown source and installs it on an item known as Jump 61. Technological analysis of the item followed, and Jonathan Byrant is assigned as its Project Leader. His supervisor, Mr. Grant, sabotages the project with a computer virus, but Jonathan somehow gains a vision of this. He rushes back to the facility. He arrives just as the building explodes, and is believed to have been killed. Unknown to all he survives and finds that the suit has bonded with him. Choosing to use his powers for good, Jonathan decides to call himself after the project: Digitek.Digitek #1 (Dec 1992) His first opponents are the villains known as Bacillicons,Bacillicons at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe three mercenaries who had been similarly transformed, but are warped by the virus. When Psi-Key is attacked by the virus, she broadcasts a worldwide distress signal, which locks onto the cyborg hero Deathlok. Deathlok is then transported to the UK. Together the two heroes defeat the Bacillicons, parting as friends.Digitek #2 (Jan 1993)  Civil War and MI:13 Digitek is later mentioned as having joined the heroes opposing the Super Hero Registration Act during the Superhuman Civil War.

C. Thomas (born 31 October 1950), an Advocate by profession and an Indian Politician. The fourth child of P. T. Chacko and Mariyamma Chacko, Pullolil House. His father late P.T. Chacko was a political stalwart in the Indian Politics especially from 1940 to 1964 August 1 i.e. till his death. Sri. P. T. Chacko was a member of Indian Constituent Assembly representing Travancore- Cochin from 1949. (The Constituent Assembly of India was formed for the purpose of drafting the Constitution of India. Following India's independence from Great Britain in 1947, its members served as the nation's first Parliament.) India became a Republic On 26 January 1950, and the first Lokh Sabha was constituted in 1952 in which P. T. Chacko was a member representing Meenachil Lok Sabha Constituency. In 1957, P. T. Chacko was elected as the first opposition leader of the Kerala Legislative Assembly. In 1960 he was again elected as a member of the second Kerala Legislative Assembly and become the Home Minister. The Kerala Congress party is a registered State Political Party, registered in 1964. Since 2010 Mr. Thomas is the Chairman of one of the tiniest factions. Mr. P. C. Thomas was the Member of Lok Sabha for consecutive terms from 1989 to 2009 (20 years).i.e. from 9th Lok Sabha to 14th Lok Sabha (was also Union Minister of State for Law and Justice from 2003 to 2004) by affiliating with many political fronts including the right wing NDA. He is also the Chairman of ‚ÄòKarshaka Sanghatana Aikyavedi‚Äô, a Farmers' non-political organization which is a platform of several associations of various types of farmers‚Äô organizations in Kerala including those of natural rubber farmers. Mr. P. C. Thomas was elected as member of 6th Bar Council of Kerala in 1986. His first contest in General election was in 1987, from Vazhoor Legislate Assembly Constituency and at that time he failed. Later in 1989 he contested in the Lok Sabha election from Muvattupuzha Lok Sabha Constituency as the candidate of Kerala Congress (M) and he defeated Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate Mr. P. P. Esthos and Mr. P. J. Joseph (political stalwart), another Kerala Congress leader. From that election onwards till 2009 he consecutively represented the Muvattupuzha Lok Sabha Constituency in the Lok Sabha for 20 years. His last contest from that Lok Sabha Constituency was in 2004 and at that time he contested as the candidate of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and he defeated both the candidates of United Democratic Front (UDF) and LDF and that victory was a landmark victory in the political history of Kerala State. However, Supreme court of India cancelled and disqualified the results in 2006 on the ground that he used his religious background to woo voters during the polls on May 10, 2004. Pursuant to the Delimitation Act, the Muvattupuzha Lok Sabha Constituency was abolished and after 14th Lok Sabha there is no Muvattupuzha Lok Sabha Constituency. Now Kerala Congress is in alliance with NDA and he is the National Committee member of the NDA. After his Lok Sabha term also, he is serving for the people especially among the various types of farmers, labourers, fishermen etc. After his Lok Sabha term, he has filed about 15 public interest litigations as part-in-person, in the Honorable High Court of Kerala and Supreme Court of India, for protecting the various rights of the farmers, labourers, fishermen and common man and for their development in different spheres. Some of the very important cases are described below :- (1) W.P.(C) No. 28492 of 2014 ‚Äì issue involved in this case was the poor situation of Natural Rubber farmers of India. In this case after hearing his arguments, the Hon‚Äôble High Court by its Judgment dated 11 March 2015 directed the Government of India to hear Mr. P. C. Thomas before finalizing the policy matters with regard to the price of Natural Rubber in India. (2) W.P.(C) No.2654 of 2012 - the main issue in this case was the wrong entry in the National Register Of Large Dams in 2009, because in that register, 4 dams situated in the land of the Kerala had been shown as Dams situated in the land of the Tamil Nadu. Those Dams are Mullaperiyar, Parambikulam, Thoonakkadavu and Peruvaripallam. (Before filing the case he had approached the Govt. many times to correct the mistake, but didn't correct.) In that case the Honorable High Court of Kerala, by its Judgment dated 22 November 2012 directed the Government of India to correct the National Register Of Dams and to make necessary entry with regard to the said Dams stating that those are situated in the land of Kerala. (3) W. A. No 2880 of 2009:- in this case, the main grievance of Mr. Thomas was that by Judgment in W.P.(C) No 15135 of 2009 the rubber plantations and other crops coming under the category of plantation had been declared as non-agricultural activities and such Judgment was highly detrimental to the interest of various farmers in India, especially among coffee, tea, cashew and rubber. (Against that Judgment, the writ petitioner did not file appeal in time, though he filed very late after filing the case of Mr. Thomas). Under that circumstance after obtaining the leave of Honorable High Court, Mr. Thomas challenged the judgment in the writ appeal and got set aside W.P.(C) No15135 of 2009. In 2006, when Finance Minister P. Chidambaram made an announcement that the Government of India will issue a commemorative coin dedicated to the 150th anniversary of Sree Narayana Guru in 3‚Äì4 months, P. C. Thomas suggested that coin' logo should be written both in Hindi and English. In 2019, P. C. Thomas announced that he will run for election again.

The purpose of the Circle is to provide a supportive, non-confrontational setting in which an individual's work can be reviewed, critiqued, and discussed. The group's underlying emphasis on quality and professionalism has, in recent years, contributed to the commercial publication of novels and/or short story collections by members including Michael Cobley, Hal Duncan, Gary Gibson, and Neil Williamson. Members have also had work published in magazines including Analog, Asimov's Science Fiction, Interzone, and The Third Alternative, and short story anthologies Nova Scotia: New Scottish Speculative Fiction, Other Edens II, Shipbuilding, and Year's Best Fantasy and Horror.  History  The origins of the Circle lie in a science fiction short story competition ‚Äì originally suggested by the SF writer Chris Boyce ‚Äì that ran for several years in The Glasgow Herald newspaper (now, The Herald). The winning entry was published in the weekend edition of the newspaper that coincided with what had effectively become, at that time, a local annual science fiction convention known as Albacon. In 1986, Ann Karkalas of the University of Glasgow Adult & Continuing Education Department contacted the competition's judge, the writer (and the Herald's then-Science Fiction reviewer) Duncan Lunan, about the possibility of starting a science fiction writing evening class. Both knew each other previously from the Glasgow Science Fiction Circle, a group of readers and writers which had met during the 1960s and 1970s. Duncan was willing to teach the course, and indeed the classes would go on to run for the best part of a decade. Many of those who attend the first year's class were so enthusiastic about writing that ‚Äì once the class finished ‚Äì they wanted to continue meeting. So they did; at the suggestion of Lunan, this new group began to refer to itself as the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle, although the group remains remarkably anarchic and non-hierarchical in form. Although the Circle's early membership largely overlapped with that of the evening classes, the two entities gradually became more distinct. After the evening classes were ended, the Circle has continued to attract new members through word of mouth, brochure entries, and its own website. Having survived several changes of venue, frequency of meetings and an almost complete turnover of members, the Circle currently meets every second Tuesday. Venues have included St Aloysius Church, the Glasgow Film Theatre, the city's branch of Border's bookshop, and a smaller function room of a Glasgow church.  Structure  The Circle's workshops are neither instructor-led nor formally arranged. Although the group does follow a set routine (modeled on the Milford Method, wherein each person who has read the story gives their comments before the author's final \\"right of reply\\" at the end of the session), the meetings are democratic in nature. The Circle does not engage in creative writing exercises: each meeting focuses specifically on the constructive criticism of an individual work, be it a short story, novella, or novel that has previously been distributed by email or via the Circle's newsgroup. This said, many members of the Circle do also regularly socialise with each other outside of these official meetings. In late 2009, some members of the Circle established a spoken word performance group called Word Dogs. This ran irregular events in and around Glasgow, such as a special horror-themed evening around Halloween 2010.  Other groups  During its history the Circle has seldom interacted with other writers groups in and around Glasgow, thanks to its focused working practices and ‚Äì arguably ‚Äì its championing of genre fiction. As a result, probably its closest links have been with members of the East Coast SF Writers Group (ECSFWG). This group shared a common origin, having originally been formed as a gathering of some east coast-based entrants to the same Glasgow Herald Science Fiction Short Story Competition. A more recent offshoot from ECSFWG is the Writers' Bloc spoken word group, with whom members of the Circle have performed in special joint events. Published works Since its inception, the circle has sponsored, or otherwise caused to be written, a number of anthologies. These are composed of original works, most often short stories, by its members. The books typically commemorate an occasion, but the most recent was published to raise money for a charitable cause. * Shipbuilding: New SF from Scotland (1995).

Closure  Disney Junior, along with their sister channels Disney XD and Disney Channel, closed in the UK on 30 September 2020, after 20 years on-air, due to Disney failing to reach a new carriage deal with Sky and Virgin Media. The closure was announced on 25 June that year. All of the channel's content was transferred to Disney's streaming service, Disney+. Virgin Media removed the channels on 29 September, with CBBC and CBeebies taking the network's former Sky EPG slots on 1 October. Presentation When Playhouse Disney originally launched in the United Kingdom, it used live presentation and links, being set in a large \\"Playhouse\\" featuring different rooms and areas. This presentation format was also used for Playhouse Disney in Australia, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Germany and several other territories outside North America. Playhouse Disney UK's main live presenters were Dave Benson Phillips and Alex Lovell, who were referred to as Big Dave and Little Alex. In addition to presenting the \\"Playhouse\\", both Dave and Alex presented \\"Music Time\\", where they sang mostly Disney songs, with the original recordings of the songs. Dave also presented the children's cookery show, Bite Size, alongside Sophie Aldred and Karl Woolley and puppet Mitzi the Oven Glove. Two other segments were also featured. The first was \\"Circle Time\\", presented by Jason Canning, where he alongside a few children, made up stories from animated drawings that viewers sent in. The other was \\"Art Play\\", presented by Sara-Louise Harper, which featured her and a few children creating a piece of artwork based on a popular Disney movie. New graphics and a new logo were introduced in March 2003, coinciding with the debut of the main Disney Channel's new look. Along with this, came a refreshing of the format. The 'Circle Time' strand was removed without a replacement presenter after Jason Canning left to pursue other work, and Art Play's presenting role was taken by Olivia Bonnici after Sara-Louise Harper left after becoming pregnant. While the \\"Playhouse\\" format would remain for the next few years, the channel's presentation gradually began to focus more on out-of-vision links, like what its American counterpart would use. In 2004, A dedicated nighttime block called \\"PJ's Bedtime\\" was introduced, being presented by Olivia and Big Dave alongside the titular puppet PJ Mole. On 27 August 2006, Dave Benson Philips and Alex Lovell left the network, while the Art Play and Music Time strands were removed around the same time due to budget cuts. The two remaining strands, PJ's Bedtime and Bite Size, were removed in November 2007 and May 2008, respectively. By then, the channel featured a format and identity in-par with its American counterpart. In September 2007, the channel logo in the external promotionals (programme press releases, promos for terrestrial television) were changed to include the inscription \\"Channel\\" as in all Playhouse Disney Europe channels, but on the channel itself, the logo was not changed. This move was to differentiate the channel from the \\"Playhouse Disney\\" block, shown all mornings on the American Disney Channel, using the two monkeys Ooh and Aah as hosts from Ooh, Aah & You between the channel links as well as using the same on screen graphics as the US block up until 2011. Presenters were re-added to the channel in September 2009, with new presenters Samantha Pearl and James Sherwood presenting on air between 6pm and 8pm. Disney Junior + A one-hour timeshift service of the channel, Disney Junior +, launched on 29 October 2007 as Playhouse Disney +, replacing the now defunct channel ABC1. It launched on the same day that the Disney Channels were reshuffled on Sky, involving Disney Cinemagic and Disney Cinemagic +1 moving down the EPG, to enable Playhouse Disney to move up the EPG to allow Playhouse Disney + to launch next to it on Sky 611 and 612 respectively. Playhouse Disney + was initially a 25-minute timeshift service until 11 April 2011 when it became a 1-hour timeshift service. It was renamed as Disney Junior +1 on 7 May 2011.

Born in Sopron, a Hungarian town at the Austrian border, Ern≈ë Gereben used, until 1935, the German-language form of his name, Ernest (or Ernst) Gr√ºnfeld. In 1926, he tied for 1st‚Äì2nd in K√∂rmend. In 1928, he won in ≈†umperk. In 1930, he took 5th in Budapest and tied for 7‚Äì8th in Gy≈ër. In 1932, he took 7th in Budapest. In 1934, he tied for 5‚Äì7th in Sopron (Rudolf Spielmann won).

In 1936, he took 4th, behind Mieczys≈Çaw Najdorf, Lajos Steiner and Endre Steiner in Budapest. Following World War II, Gereben played in several Hungarian Chess Championships. In 1947, he won team gold medal and individual silver medal at sixth board in the 2nd Balkan Games in Sofia. In 1947, he took 7th in Vienna (2nd Schlechter Memorial; Szab√≥ won).

In 1958/59, he took 3rd in Hastings. In 1959, he tied for 1st in Bognor Regis. In 1960, he tied for 4-5th in Zurich. In 1963/64, he tied for 1st-4th in Reggio Emilia.

He remained a keen player in his adopted country even into his seventies.
