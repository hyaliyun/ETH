He was Minister of the Royal Household from 1821 to 1827. Early years Ambroise- Polycarpe de La Rochefoucauld was born in Paris on 2 April 1765. He was the grandson of Alexandre-Nicolas de La Rochefoucauld (1709-1760), Marquis de Surg√®res, who was cited by Voltaire in his √âloges. His parents were Viscount Jean-Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld (1735-1789), Brigadier, and Anne-Sabine- Rosalie de Chauvelin, daughter of Germain Louis de Chauvelin (1685-1762), Marquis de Grosbois, Keeper of the Seals of France. At the age of fourteen La Rochefoucauld married a descendant of Fran√ßois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, Mademoiselle de Montmirail. Two years later he joined the dragoons as a second lieutenant, and served in the king's army until 1792. He rose to the position of deputy-major of cavalry. During the French Revolution he emigrated, and made a series of tours of different countries of Europe, He returned to France under the Consulate, but stayed out of politics. Despite offers from Napoleon, he would only accept the position of a member of the General Council of the Marne. Bourbon Restoration Duc de Doudeauville, Philanthropist After the first Bourbon Restoration, on 4 June 1814 La Rochefoucauld was appointed to the Chamber of Peers. He sat among the most ardent royalists. He voted for death in the trial of Marshal Ney. He fought against freedom of the press, which he viewed as a source of ruin for the country. On 26 September 1822 he was appointed director general of the posts. He gained a reputation as a skilled administrator, and introduced several visible improvements in the service. On 4 August 1824 King Charles X appointed La Rochefoucauld Minister of the Royal Household in place of Marshal Jacques Lauriston. One of his main acts while in office was to acquire the lands of Grignon for the royal domain and to establish there the Royal Agronomic Institute of Grignon. In 1828 he fought against the dismissal of the National Guard. He resigned as minister on 4 January 1828 and from then on devoted himself to managing charitable institutions. July Monarchy La Rochefoucauld was greatly attached to the elder branch of the Bourbons, and did not approve of the July Revolution of 1830. He spoke in the Chamber of Peers against proposals to perpetually banish the former royal family. On 9 January 1831 he resigned from the Chamber and his name was removed from the list of peers of France. He died at the Ch√¢teau de Montmirail, Montmirail, Marne, on 2 June 1841, aged 76.

Their tactics included the displacement of frontal peaceful protesters from lightly barricaded camps at the Independence Square and part of Khreshchatyk Street which is near Bessarabska Square. The government claimed the need to maintain public order and the enforcement of a decision made by the Pecherskyi District Court, that was read by state bailiffs to the protesters. However, it was later established that such a procedure was illegal, as state executors only had the right to read decisions until 10pm. The court order was also explicit in the fact that Vitali Klitschko was forbidden to hinder citizens moving along the main streets. Vitali Klitschko himself was not aware of this decision, nor was he given the opportunity to appeal it. People responsible for the assault against the protesters have not been identified. Events =Beginning of the assault= The Berkut special police units began their attempt to clear up Euromaidan at 1:02 am. The Berkut soldiers began to break down the barricades on Instytutska Street, while starting a fight with \\"Freedom\\" party deputies Ruslan Koshulynskyi, Oleksii Kaida, Andrii Mishchenko and Oleh Osuhovskyi. Two of the deputies sustained injuries on their faces and bodies. At 1:33 a.m. Andriy Shevchenko informed the protesters that Berkut forces were going to break the barricades from the side of Mykhailivska Square.–°–ò–õ–û–í–ò–ö–ò –ü–†–û–†–í–ê–õ–ò–°–Ø –ù–ê –ú–ê–ô–î–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞, 11 –≥—Ä—É–¥–Ω—è 2013 —Ä. Violent fights occurred in the Square as the Berkut started destroying the barricade on Instytutska Street, and Titushky started plundering the camp. Although the government concentrated a large number of security forces around the square, protesters did not give up and their number eventually grew. Berkut used tear gas on the protesters and the clouds of the smoke were visible over the crowd as reports about arrested and injured people, including MPs, were being aired in the news. Calls for mass mobilization of Kyiv citizens to the Maidan were spread and many people responded to the call. Berkut assault on Maidan Nezalezhnosti. =Main assault= The Berkut suspended their assault and protesters were given shields, which were obtained from the Berkut. The Berkut began to regroup and move against the protesters once again. Unarmed protesters with linked arms had been holding the Euromaidan defense line for three hours against the large mass of Berkut from the Instytutska street side of the square. The number of people at Euromaidan grew, but the leaders of Berkut were also trying to regroup their forces in order to attack from the other side. Several titushky (thugs) sprang out from the Prorizna street and started to attack people with the intent to organize a hash. There were more than 15 thousand people on the Maidan at this time. The Berkut continued trying to break into the Trade Unions Building. With the number of people on the Maidan increasing, the Berkut came closer to the Maidan and tried to encircle it.alt= =Bells of the Maidan= As 4,000 Berkut soldiers attacked the square, the bell-ringer of the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery Ivan Sydor (of the UOC-KP), rang the bells in alarm. The bells rang constantly from 1 a.m. to 5a.m, \\"urging people to go to the main square of the capital and support the protesters who were threatened by Yanukovych‚Äôs security forces.\\" 8 hours after the assault had begun, Maidan self-defense units stabilized the Euromaidan perimeter by pushing the Berkut fighters back beyond the barricades. Aftermath The forceful assault of the peaceful protesters are mostly seen by observers as unreasonable. Observers have stated that if Yanukovych simply let the protesters be, the demonstrations would have died out. Due to the violent and illegal crackdown by authorities, the demonstration proved to be a success. The warning alarm system of the National Resistance Headquarters enabled activists to come by cars, public transport and some taxis gave free rides. The illegal court order served by the assaulting forces was not executed and the government didn't attempt to enforce it again. Ultimately, the Euromaidan protest and its crackdown contributed to the collapse of Yanukovych's government in February 2014. Scholars noted that the demonstration showed an unprecedented tenacity and self-organization on the part of the protesters - phenomena that are considered unique in post-Soviet mass mobilization. Specifically, this aspect also gave rise to an emergent volunteer movement and the rise of in activism of civil society groups in Ukraine. The majority of the protesters were not affiliated with any political organization. The Euromaidan protest also has bearing on the Russian response to the protest and Yanukovych ouster. Its annexation of Crimea and its military incursion into Ukraine were activities that - for a number of observers - indicate a fear of having to contend with \\"a Maidan of its own, about exercising control in its 'spheres of interests and influence' and about contradictions between East and West, as perceived by Russia.\\" On 20 February 2019, priest Ivan Sydor, who had rung the bell of the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery, received the Ukrainian Order of Merit of the third class \\"[f]or civic courage, selfless defence of the constitutional principles of democracy, human rights and freedoms, discovered during the Revolution of Dignity, fruitful public and volunteering activities\\". On 4 April 2019, it was reported that Ivan Sydor had received his Ukrainian Order of Merit of the third class from Yevhen Nyshchuk, the Ukrainian Minister for Culture.

Their first product for shopping centers, MALLY ( My Mall in Hebrew ◊û◊ï◊ú◊ô ), with its interactive 3D maps, tells the visitor Where is he standing, What is around him, How to get to each spot and Who is there to share his experience with. The platform is an end-to-end solution, dynamic content and notification support, with 2D to 3D automatic conversion, managed in the cloud and displayable on all mobile devices. On February, 2014, the company joined Wayra, the Telefonica global accelerator and opened offices in London and Madrid ( managed by Jorge Garc√≠a-Morato - Geniusmatcher's COO ).  Technology  Mally differs from other traditional indoor navigation solutions as it is hardware free and user oriented, targeted to help users find their way and understand perfectly their environment. Flat maps are difficult to understand and to describe the real world. Mally 3D Maps provide the user an immersive experience merging reality with the virtual world. Mally uses the smartphone or tablet built in camera to locate the users where GPS does not work or is not accurate enough. There is no extra hardware required or installations. The system detects the user's exact position and sets it over the 3D Map.  Content  The content is published by the platform customers, initially shopping centres.

It was a \\"technical tour de force\\" as the first motorcycle ever designed with a dual overhead camshaft. It also used a multi- valve cylinder head, with four valves per cylinder. Development and technology  The Swiss engineer Ernest Henry adapted his incredibly successful Peugeot four-cylinder automobile racing engine (1912) for a racing motorcycle. The 500M used a parallel twin-cylinder engine, with dual overhead camshafts driven by a cascade of gears between the cylinders, with four-valve cylinder heads. The 500M was the most technically advanced motorcycle in the world when introduced. However, the design was ahead of the metallurgy available at the time, and suffered from cracking between the valve seats. While the engine was incredibly advanced, power transmission was a single speed via direct belt drive. At the rear wheel the Peugeot had a pedal- operated drum brake. Front suspension was a girder fork.Bourdache, Jean (1989). La Motocyclette en France 1894-1914. Edifree, Paris, 1989  Test drives  Peugeot proved the reliability of the motor bike in test runs conducted in 1913. The racing motorcycle reached a world record of over the flying kilometre for its displacement class. The company entered reliable and proven two-cylinder V-engines with simple valve actuation in the 1913 French motorcycle Grand Prix. The machine was raced at various venues, but its full potential was thwarted due to the First World War.  Later redesigns  Peugeot resumed development in 1919 of Henry's original 1913/4 design. Major redesigns were executed by Marcel Gr√©millon in 1919 who moved the DOHC gear drive to the side of the engine, and a 3-speed gearbox with clutch. Lessman Antonesco altered the design again in 1923, changing the design to a simpler OHC, 2-valve motor with the camshaft driven by shaft-and-bevel. This proved the fastest and most reliable variant of all, but by 1925, Peugeot separated its motorcycling and automotive divisions, and the GP twin project was abandoned.Jardy, Alain (2013). 'Peugeot 500 GP 1914', RAD Magazine, Oct, 2013 2010 reproduction For the 100th anniversary of the model, an electronics engineer named Jean Boulicot built a reproduction between c. 2000 and 2010 from Henry's original blueprints, using a home lathe and milling machine.

The series follows the daily adventures of Madeline, a 7-year-old girl attending a boarding school in Paris with eleven other girls, under the care of their teacher, Miss Clavel. The first book was published in 1939, and proved to be a success, so Bemelmans wrote many sequels in the 1940s and 1950s. The series continued, written by Bemelmans' grandson John Bemelmans Marciano. In the first book, Madeline's \\"papa\\" sends her a dolls' house when she is recovering from an appendectomy, and the girls all go to visit their parents in the Christmas book. As of 1998, the series had sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Series summary Each book in the series begins with the rhyme: Madeline is the smallest yet bravest of the twelve girls at the boarding school. She is only 7 years old and is the only redhead in the school. She has many adventures while there, including falling off a bridge and being saved by a stray dog, and meeting Pepito, the mischievous boy next door. Books The original series by Ludwig Bemelmans consists of six books: * Madeline - Madeline gets appendicitis and must go to a hospital to have her appendix removed. * Madeline's Rescue - Madeline falls off a bridge and is rescued by a stray dog, who joins her school. Winner of the 1954 Caldecott Medal. * Madeline and the Bad Hat - The Spanish Ambassador moves in next door, and Madeline instinctively realizes that his son Pepito is mean and spoiled. * Madeline in London - Madeline visits Pepito, who moved to London. * Madeline and the Gypsies - Madeline and Pepito run away to join a group of traveling gypsies. * Madeline's Christmas - Madeline celebrates Christmas with her friends. The first five in the series were recorded as audio-books narrated by Carol Channing, originally released on LP by Caedmon Records and later released on audio-cassette: * Madeline and Other Bemelmans Told by Carol Channing [TC 1113], including Madeline, Madeline's Rescue and Madeline and the Bad Hat * Madeline and the Gypsies [TC 1304]), including Madeline and the Gypsies and Madeline in London The new series by John Bemelmans-Marciano consists of the following books: * Madeline in America and Other Holiday Tales - Madeline travels to Texas. * Madeline Loves Animals - Madeline travels to the zoo and meets the animals. * Madeline Says Merci - Madeline learns how to be polite. * Madeline and the Cats of Rome - Madeline and her class travel to Rome in spring. * Madeline at the White House - Madeline and her class visit the White House in Washington, DC. * Madeline and the Old House in Paris - Madeline and Pepito encounter a ghost in the old house in Paris. Characters *Madeline: The smallest of the girls and the title character. She is from 7 years old to 8 years old, and she is the only redhead in her class. She had her appendix removed in the first story. She is known for being the bravest and most outgoing of the girls. Contrary to popular belief, and to her depiction in the animated series and in the live-action film, she, and by extension, her classmates, weren't orphans in the original books, and were attending a Catholic boarding school. This is further reinforced in the first book wherein she received a dollhouse from her father (whose surname is revealed to be Fogg in Madeline in America and Other Holiday Tales). She is also not actually French.https://www.npr.org/2013/10/11/230949629/at-75-shes- doing-fine-kids-still-love-their-madeline At 75 She's Doing Fine; Kids Still Love Their 'Madeline' Voiced by Andrea Libman. *Miss Clavel: Madeline's teacher and minder. She is commonly believed to be a Catholic nun because of her general appearance, but her attire in Bemelmans' illustrations is actually that of a nurse. The fact that she is not a nun is also evidenced by the fact that she is not called \\"Sister\\" or \\"Mother\\". She is always trying to keep Madeline out of trouble. Voiced by Stevie Vallance. *Pepito: The Spanish Ambassador's son, who is about Madeline's age; he lives next door to the girls. For a time, he was constantly bullying the girls and being cruel to animals, but he changed his ways after one of his cruel tricks backfired. Due to his bratty nature and the distinctive hat that he constantly wore, he was called \\"the Bad Hat\\" by the girls. He stopped wearing the hat after he befriended the girls. Voiced by David Morse. *Lord Cucuface: Chairman of the school's board of trustees. He initially ordered the removal of the dog Genevieve, but had a change of heart after receiving one of her puppies. He is known as \\"Lord Covington\\" in the live action movie. Voiced by French Tickner. *Genevieve: The girls' anthropomorphic dog. She is extremely intelligent, possessing skills such as juggling and arithmetic, and is beloved by Madeline and her friends. She was a stray until she saved Madeline from drowning. *Students at the school: The other girls who attend the boarding school with Madeline.

Built between 1832 and 1834, it was an endowment of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, who was also its founder. It is located next to the Residence of Prince Milo≈°.Spomenici kulture u Srbiji The church was declared a cultural monument and protected by the state in 1949.  Origin  During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian leader Karaƒëorƒëe realized the importance of Topƒçider valley for the military and economic blockade of Belgrade Fortress, held by Ottomans at the time. During one of the sieges, Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá was charged with keeping the road to Valjevo and Kragujevac closed. However, he reached an agreement with the Ottomans and allowed their army to pass. Infuriated Karaƒëorƒëe captured Milo≈° and took him to the old, abandoned cemetery in Topƒçider, to kill him. After pleadings of vojvoda Mladen Milovanoviƒá, Karaƒëorƒëe spared Milo≈°'s life. Historians believe that this was actually the only time that Karaƒëorƒëe drew his flintlock at someone, without killing him. In memory of this \\"miracle\\", when he became ruler, Prince Milo≈° decided to build a church and a konak for the Serbian metropolitan bishop. However, Prince Milo≈° organized assassinations of both Karaƒëorƒëe (in 1817) and Mladenoviƒá (in 1823), so it could be the church was built because of remorse (see Pokajnica Monastery).  Construction  Construction began on 28 July 1832 and was conducted by Janja Mihajloviƒá, Nikola ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Had≈æi Nikola ≈Ωivkoviƒá. As the workers were paid poorly by the prince, and with delays, the construction dragged until summer 1834, with short interruptions. The prince's penny-pinching also resulted in the selection of the materials for the church. The bell tower and konak are partially built from the old headstones. On one of them, on the back side of the tower, the horse pliers are carved pointing to the profession of the deceased (farrier).  Characteristics  Prince Milo≈° donated three bells to the church. During the occupation by Austria- Hungary in World War I, two of them were removed and transported to Vienna. With other bells gathered from other Orthodox churches in occupied countries, Austrian army melted them and used them for the arms production. The third bell, a smallest one, survived until today. The church has an unusual iconostasis. The first one, work of several painters, was done from 1834 to 1837. In 1874 it was relocated to the parish church in the village of Bariƒç. Present iconostasis is a work of Stevan Todoroviƒá, a renowned artist and painter, and his collaborator Nikola Markoviƒá. Todoroviƒá's originality is noticeable in certain departures from the usual choice of motifs and layout of the icons. Instead of Saint Archdeacon Stephen on the south altar doors, he painted young Tobias in company of angels, as a representation and symbol of the burdened mankind. Above, Todoroviƒá painted the Saint Stefan Deƒçanski, while John the Baptist was replaced with Saint Sava who, in turn, doesn't resemble at all the best known Sava's representation, in the Mile≈°eva monastery. As a curiosity, none of the saints is painted with a halo. Carvings were done by sculptor Dimitrije Petroviƒá. The church and the adjoining konak were placed under the state protection in 1949.

This method has been practised since the 6th century in various parts of the world, and is still practiced in southern Bangladesh. History Otter fishing has been practiced historically in a number of regions including Central Europe, Northern Africa, the British Isles, Scandinavia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and China. The earliest records of otter fishing are from the Yangtze region of China during the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) and was observed in the 13th century by Marco Polo on the Yangtze River. Otter fishing in China was practiced for subsistence and also collectively for profit. The Chinese reputedly learned the techniques from the fishermen of Southeast Asia. In India, otter fishing was practiced in the Indus and Ganges river basins, in Bengal and in South India along the Coromandel Coast. Otter fishing was known in Europe from as early as the 16th century. The Scandinavians trained otters for catching trout. Olaus Magnus, the Archbishop of Uppsala, published a tome in 1555, De Gentibus Septentrionalibus (On Northern Peoples), which includes a sketch of a fishing otter. One of the motifs of Magnus's 1539 map of Scandinavia, Carta marina, is an otter fetching a fish for its master, who is ready with a knife and a cooking vessel on the fire. Fishing with otters was known in England, Scotland, Germany and Poland. The first mention of otter fishing in the British Isles dates to 1480, while the method for training otters is described in the 1653 book on angling by Izaak Walton, The Compleat Angler. Individual sportsmen in the Americas and Europe have also used otters for sport fishing. British sportsmen who had served in South India during the early years of the Raj have been known to import this practice to their homes in Europe. Otter fishing is also reported from Central and South America. A Maxacali creation story from Brazil suggests that the practice of otter fishing may have been prevalent in the past. Fishermen from Guyana used a different tactic ‚Äì they would observe where an otter deposited its catch and later purloin the fish. Method In the Old World, two otter species have been primarily used in otter fishing ‚Äì the European otter (Lutra lutra), chiefly in Europe and North Africa, and the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), mostly in South Asia and China. Olaus Magnus wrote that the otter often fetches the catch for its master but \\"once in awhile forgets and eats the fish\\". Izaak Walton's 1653 book describes otter pups, three to four months old, being domesticated and trained. The otters were muzzled to prevent them eating fish and secured by lines to their master. The otters then chased fish in a pond into a net. Another technique was to submerge nets and get the otters to shepherd the fish into them, after which the nets, along with otters and catch, were retrieved. In ancient China, the otter wore a leather harness on its body to which an iron chain was attached. The other end of the chain was either secured to the fisherman's boat or to a bamboo pole. The fisherman would cast his circular net, weighted at the edges, and pull it in. As the net was being pulled in, the otter would be introduced into the net through a small opening. The otter's role was to search for and disturb fish hiding in nooks and crannies and force them into the net so that they were trapped. The otter was subsequently rewarded in the case of a good catch. The practice of using otters to drive fish into nets was prevalent in Asia and is still practiced in southern Bangladesh. Bangladesh Otter fishermen in the Sundarbans National Park, Bangladesh Otter fishing is still practiced in Narail and Khulna districts, near the Sunderbans in southern Bangladesh. Here fishing with otters is a traditional practice in families, passed down through the generations by fishermen who breed the otters and train them to chase the fish into their nets. Earlier, both Lutra lutra and Lutrogale perspicillata were used for otter fishing, but today, only L. perspicillata is used. Otter fishing is usually done at night between 9 PM and 5 AM. The average catch by a single boat in a night ranges from of crabs, fish and shrimp. Feeroz et al. (2011) recorded a population of 176 domesticated otters held in captivity amongst 46 groups of fishermen in these districts, of which 138 were working animals. Lack of fish, changes sought in livelihoods by the young and more economical methods of fishing have reduced the number of otter fishermen drastically.

Shuhada Street, the main road leading to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, used to be the central wholesale market of the Hebron region, as its central location to the tomb, and the location of the bus station and police station, made it a natural gathering place. After riots following the February 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, Israel closed the street for Palestinians. In the early 2000s, in accordance with the Hebron Protocol, the street was completely reopened to Arab vehicular traffic. The shops, however, remained closed. Parts of the street were closed again to Palestinians after violence in the Second Intifada. After the closure of all Palestinian shops, the Palestinian municipal and governmental offices, and the central bus station, which became an Israeli army base, al-Shuhada Street became virtually a ghost town. The Vegetable and Wholesale Markets next to the Avraham Avinu settlement are a closed area for Palestinians now.

History  Israeli checkpoint in Shuhada Street, guarding the Jews-only area. Palestinian house owners may enter by foot. (2012) Following the Israeli occupation of Hebron in 1967, a number of settlements were established in and around the city. The first settlement, being Kiryat Arba, was started in 1968 near the Cave of the Patriarchs, which is located a few hundred meters north of the Shuhada Street. Sarah Nachshon, the wife of its founder, started another settlement in a police station in the Shuhada Street in 1979.Among the Settlers, p. 2. Jeffrey Goldberg, The New Yorker, 31 May 2004 In February 1994, a Jewish settler from Kiryat Arba killed 29 Muslims in the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. Subsequently, the Yitzhak Rabin-led Government closed the Palestinian shops and prohibited Palestinian vehicular traffic in the nearby Shuhada Street, to protect the settlers. The army closed down 304 shops and warehouses along Shuhada Street, as well as Palestinian municipal and governmental offices. The central bus station was turned into an army base.17 years after Goldstein Massacre, Hebron city center paralyzed. B'Tselem, 3 March 2011 The Tomb of the Patriarchs was divided into separate sections for Jewish and Muslim worshippers. = After the Hebron Protocol = In the 1997 Hebron Protocol, more specifically the Agreed Minute of 7 January 1997, Israel agreed to completely reopen the Shuhada Street and restore the situation which existed prior to February 1994 (article 7 of the Protocol). The street was reopened for traffic for a year; the shops, however, remained closed. In 1998, vehicles where prohibited again. The street was alternately opened and closed, until it was definitively closed for all Palestinians upon the Second Intifada. All entrances to the houses in al-Shuhada Street were sealed. Since then, the house owners can only enter their home through climbing the roofs or through holes in the wall.The Rooftops of Hebron. Video of B'Tselem, November 2006Hope in Hebron. David Shulman, New York Review of Books, 22 March 2013: ‚Ä≥Those who still live on Shuhada Street can‚Äôt enter their own homes from the street. Some use the rooftops to go in and out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or up a flight of stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B‚ÄôTselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)‚Äîsome 1,014 families‚Äîhave abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.‚Ä≥ In 2005, after the ACRI had petitioned the state, Israel presented to the High Court a \\"plan for protection of the Jewish community in Hebron\\", according to which Palestinians would be allowed to walk on the street, but the prohibition on opening shops and on vehicular traffic on the street would remain in force. Shuhada Street with closed Palestinian shops in 2010. It is claimed that the passing for Palestinians is forbidden, & only Israeli settlers and tourists are allowed to pass. In December 2006, the IDF declared that Palestinian pedestrians had been refused entry for six years \\"by mistake\\". Previously having been stopped by soldiers, some Palestinians and activists were permitted access for 3 days. Stones were thrown at them by Jewish settler children, without being stopped by the accompanying policemen and soldiers. Instead, a 75-year-old volunteer was arrested, after she tried to prevent one of the soldiers from kicking one of her colleagues. Then, the street was declared a \\"closed military area\\" and entirely closed again, because ‚Ä≥there had been disturbances at that spot in the last few days‚Ä≥.A six-year mistake. Akiva Eldar, Haaretz, 4 January 2007 In February 2007, Haaretz reported that six settler families had been living in caravans in an IDF camp in Shuhada Street for more than ten years. An IDF spokesman said Israeli settlers were authorized to live in the site in the early 1990s. Dror Etkes of Peace Now described the situation as an \\"unhealthy coupling\\" that reflected the \\"growing distortion in the relations between the IDF and settlers\\". In April 2007, under public pressure, and the night before the Supreme Court would hear the case, the Civil Administration issued temporary permits to some Palestinian occupants to re-use their main entrance on the street. Visitors were still denied use of these entrances. The army unsealed the welding on the front doors of homes. After August 2008, the permits were no longer renewed. Currently, Palestinian shops are still prohibited in al-Shuhada Street, and Palestinian vehicles forbidden to enter. Palestinian pedestrians are subject to frequent rigorous control by Israeli soldiers at the many checkpoints in and around the street, and in some parts completely banned from entering.  Violence against Palestinians and humiliation In April 2014, as reported by Ma'an, Jewish settlers invaded the home of Palestinian inhabitants of Shuhada Street, beat the family, and wounded Zidan Sharbati.

Jourdain is credited with protecting Red Lake's extensive tribal sovereignty and improving tribal infrastructure during his tenure in office.  Early life  Jourdain was born on July 27, 1912. He received an eighth-grade education and worked as a machine operator, participating in the construction of the Alaska Highway and the regional airport in Bemidji, Minnesota. Additionally, Jourdain was a leading member of the \\"Young Man's Council\\", a group of Red Lake citizens desirous of governmental reform. A revised constitution supported by the Young Man's Council resulted in the replacement of Red Lake's traditionally-selected governing body by an elected tribal council, of which Jourdain was elected chair in 1959.  Chairmanship  Following his election as chairman, Jourdain undertook a number of projects aimed at improving Red Lake's infrastructure. Shortly after taking office, he reopened the closed Indian Health Service hospital in the town of Red Lake and worked successfully to bring running water to the reservation. Additionally, Jourdain lobbied the federal government to support housing and educational development on the reservation. Jourdain spent considerable amounts of time in Washington, D.C., lobbying both for federal support and for the protection of Red Lake's tribal sovereignty. Jourdain maintained Red Lake's exclusion from the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which established the multi-reservation Minnesota Chippewa Tribe; accordingly, Red Lake remained exempt from legislation such as Public Law 280. Additionally, Jourdain formed a political alliance with U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey, subsequently changing his initial Republican political affiliation to Democratic. In 1976, Jourdain served as a delegate to the 1976 Democratic National Convention and in the Electoral College; he reprised the former role in 1984. Jourdain worked closely with other tribes, initiating a 1967 intertribal boycott of businesses in Bemidji, Minnesota, which contains a significant Native American population. The boycott was prompted by racist comments made by a county commissioner on a Bemidji radio station. Additionally, Jourdain worked with other tribal politicians to establish a national tribal chairmen's association. He is also credited with the creation of the Minnesota Indian Scholarship Program. In the late 1970s, Stephanie Hanson, the Red Lake secretary-treasurer, accused Jourdain's administration of \\"nepotism [and] favoritism,\\" and declined to pay Tribal Council members after a missed meeting. After several disputes over tribal finances, Jourdain removed Hanson from her position. On May 19, 1979, six armed supporters of Hanson seized the Red Lake law enforcement facility and took hostages, prompting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to remove Red Lake police from the reservation. Following this action, a riot erupted on the reservation during which Jourdain's home and several government facilities were burned; two teenagers died during the unrest, and damages sustained totaled $4,000,000. Following the civil unrest, Jourdain moved to Bemidji, where he resided for the remainder of his tenure as tribal chairman. Complaints persisted against Jourdain's administration throughout the 1980s; its handling of criminal defendants in Red Lake's tribal court was criticized as heavy-handed. In July 1989, Jourdain vetoed a Tribal Council decision, which had stalled the tribe's assumption of services theretofore provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. This veto attracted controversy, and Jourdain was defeated for reelection in 1990, losing to former ally Gerald Brun. = Post-chairmanship = Following his defeat, Jourdain received the National Congress of American Indians' yearly award. He died on March 21, 2002 at North Regional Hospital in Bemidji, at the age of 89. He was preceded in death by his wife, Margaret, to whom he was married for 60 years.

G. Ejaife (born 1 June 1912 ‚Äì 6 March 1972) was an Urhobo nationalist from Okpara Inland and the first principal of the premier Urhobo College Effurun, Warri. He was one of two recipients of scholarship awards from Urhobo Progress Union during World War II years. (The other recipient was G. N. Igho.) He returned to Nigeria after his graduation with a B.A. degree of Durham University in 1948, thus becoming the first Urhobo graduate. He then became the founding Principal of Urhobo College, Effurun. He brought that famous secondary school to its great heights in many fields. Mr. Ejaife later served in many other capacities in Urhobo affairs. He was Urhobo's first Senator, serving with distinction in Nigeria's Upper Chamber during the country's First Republic. Early life McNeil Gabriel Ejaife was born 1 June 1912 to Utujoh Ejaife of Okpara and Temienor Akpowhowho of Eku at Okurekpo in Agon, an Urhobo Clan in Delta State of Nigeria. Okpara Inland is a community located in the Ethiope East local government area of Delta State Nigeria. This community is a progeny of the Agbon Kingdom. He was one of three siblings. The oldest was a woman. His two brothers were Frederick Obodeti Ejaife, a lawyer, and Johnson Jakovo Ejaife, a medical doctor. He also had three other brothers from a different mother. One of them James Madedon Ejaife, a tailor who lived at the Ejaife house at Okpara Waterside. He was named McNeil after the captain of a British ship with whom his mother did some trading business. Okpara was mainly a farming community when Ejaife was young, the crops grown there such as yams, okra and cassava were cultivated largely by families and clans. His father was a hardworking peasant whose ancestors were all highly respected members of the community. Education and career He attended Anglican school at Okpara and then went to St Andrews Teacher's training college Oyo, in Oyo State. Some of his contemporaries at St Andrews were: Dr S Taiwo, a former federal permanent secretary of education; chief Ajasin, a former minister in the Nigeria federal government; the Rev Alayonde former principal of the international secondary school at the University of Ibadan. Following graduation from there in the early 1930s, he went to Warri where he taught at the CMS elementary until the latter part of the 1930s. He later moved to Ibuzor in Delta State where he was to teach at St Thomas's teacher‚Äô training College until returning to Warri in 1943. During that time he devoted himself to extramural studies and sat for and obtained his London Matriculation, as it was then called. At about that time, his hard work studiousness were recognized by the Urhobo People, particularly Chief Mukoro Mowoe. Under the latter's leadership, plan were being made to create a secondary school. Because of the potential seen in McNeil Ejaife, he was awarded a scholarship to study abroad. In 1944 he left his wife and three sons aged five, four, and two to the care of his father in law in Warri and proceeded to Fourabay College in Sierra Leone for the first phase of his undergraduate studies. He passed his intermediate Bachelors in Art Degree after eighteen months and then went on to Durham University in England where he graduated with BA in Arts in 1948. Being the first Urhobo Graduate, he returned to a grand welcome by the Urhobo Community. Transportation for the entourage was provided by Chief Onokar Aghoghovia. The reception was held at the home of Chief Mukoro Mowoe in Okere Road, Warri. Present at the time were Chief Mowarin, Chief James Obahor, chief Akpoteheri Edewor of Robert Road Warri. Ejaife and Urhobo College When the time came to form Urhobo secondary he was appointed the founding principal. The school was initially called Urhobo Collegiate School but later changed to its current name Urhobo College. The school was first located on Warri-Sapele Road Less than half a mile from Cemetery Road, not far from Igbudu, and almost adjacent to the old Warri cemetery. There were about two dozen students at the time He chose the school Motto; ‚ÄúAUT OPTIMUM AUT NIHIL‚Äù i.e., ‚ÄúThe Best or Nothing‚Äù. Two of the founding Students were Wilfred Obahor and Emmanuel Susu. The principal's residence was a bungalow rented from Chief Egboge in Igbudu, opposite GKS campus on Warri ‚Äì Sapele Road. Mrs. Cecilia Ejaife procured the students Food initially but chief Akpovegbeta Onokuakpor was soon appointed the food contractor. Some of the founding teachers were Chief Daniel Okumagba, Mr. Omniabus, Gordon Ako, and Mr. George Diejomaoh. Mr. A.I. Igho became the vice-principal on arrival from England in 1951 as the second Urhobo graduate. He died rather prematurely, a few years later. The current campus at Effurun was opened in 1950. The student population grew from then on. The principal's house was first occupied by the Ejaife family in 1957. Other staff houses were also opened at about that time. The houses were occupied by the likes of Mr. Samuel Okudu who later left and subsequently became the registrar of the University of Ibadan. Professor Tamnuo and Mr. Demas Akpoe, Mr. Vincent Uvieghara, just to name a few, were also on the staff. MG Ejaife remained the principal until 1966, the year of the first Nigerian military Coup. At the time he was also a member of the Nigerian Senate having been appointed at the time of Nigerian Independence in 1960. Ejaife's personality As a teacher he showed great versatility. He taught English language, English literature, Latin, Mathematics and sometimes geography. He taught in elementary and secondary schools as well as teacher's training college. His home was like another school with his children. He also tutored the children of many friends and relatives. He was encouraging good study habits. Indeed, some of his peer in his village school thought he had gone crazy when he would pluck some leaves to examine as part of his nature study lessons. The word crazy ‚ÄúKorebe‚Äù in Urhobo language literally translated means: ‚Äúpluck leaves‚Äù. He served in the Scholarship Board of the old Western Region of Nigeria. He was also a member of the Cooperative Development Board of that region. He was mentor to such prominent people as chief justice Ovie Whiskey, Professor Bajah, Demas Akpore the current Ovie of Agbon, just to name a few. He was a reluctant but influential politician. He was very active in the Urhobo progressive union (UPU). He played a major part in the formal installation and restoration of the titleship of the Ovie of Agbon, in 1952. This was essential to participate in the House of Chiefs in the former Western Region of Nigeria. He was a world traveler, having traveled to Europe, American and Australia in connection with education and as part of his senatorial assignment. He was a man of faith and lifetime member of Sacred Heart Catholic parish in Warri. He was at knight of the blessed Murumba. Rev. Bishop Lucas Nwaezeapu was his student at St Thomas‚Äô Ibuzor. Rev Msgr Stephen Umurie, the first Urhobo Catholic priest, was a close friend. Friends and family One name worthy of mentioning in MG Ejaife's life is that of his lifetime friend and contemporary, our most respected Dr F O Esiri the first Urhobo medical doctor. He was MG's personal physician and cared for him with the utmost dedication at his infirmary at Cemetery Road Warri when he had his stroke until he recovered enough to go convalesce with his son in Ibadan. It was his late wife Agnes Esiri who introduced Mrs. Cecilia Ejaife to MG as he was often called. Other notables include Chief Thomas Adogbeji Salubi with whom he interacted both at the UPU and the Urhobo College School Board, and was one of the first to recognize his scholarship potential. Anglican Bishop Arawori, Peter Inweh, were both great mentors. MG would be very proud to know that the school he helped found is still a thriving institution today, and a bust of him has been erected as a tribute in that campus. He will also be proud than an elementary school has been named after him in his hometown of Okpara Inland. The joy of a teacher is to know that many of his pupils have surpassed his level of education and are now serving in various capacities in different walks of life, whether in academics or in public life, and at different levels. He was indeed very excited at the return of his son to Nigeria from the UK in 1969 after graduation from medical school and completing a year of internship. It was six months after that he became ill. He was to live for only barely two more years before his premature death. He had a favorite saying: ‚ÄúThose who aim at the tree tops, fall on the ground. Those who aim at the clouds fall above the trees‚Äù. Personal life It was while teaching in Warri that he met his lovely wife Cecilia Gladys Fischer, the daughter of Emmanuel Edema of number sixteen Robert Road, Warri. They got married in 1938. Death At the time of the military coup of 1966, like many others he had to go into hiding in the village. After the invading soldiers were driven from Warri he had to abandon his job as the principal and the senate no longer in existence under military rule. He was appointed District director of education in Ughelli locality. It was while on this job that he sustained a massive stroke in 1969, the result of hypertension of which he had been unaware. He was left with significant physical and intellectual disability that ended his career. After spending a period of time recuperating with his son in Ibadan he was resettled in his own residence in 1971. He subsequently died at his home in March 1972 just short of the age 60. He was survived by his wife Chief Cecilia Gladys Ejaife who died in June 2002, his sons Augustine, an Engineer, John, a general surgeon in the US and Clement, now deceased, but formerly a member of the Lagos airport staff, and four grandchildren at the time of his death. He was buried in his home town Okparara waterside.

Force Majeure purchased land for an estate vineyard within Washington‚Äôs famed Red Mountain AVA, and initially developed the site in 2006-2007. In June 2014, winemaker Todd Alexander of famous Napa Valley cult winery Bryant Family Vineyard became the estate Winemaker for Force Majeure, as they discontinued the Collaboration Series to focus on the estate vineyard and winemaking. Additionally, famous Napa winemaker Helen Keplinger works as a consultant for Force Majeure. Vineyards Force Majeure holds a 40 acre site in Washington state's Red Mountain AVA, about half of which is planted to vines. Development started in 2006, and is ongoing. Force Majeure's Red Mountain vineyard was the first hillside vineyard of its kind in Washington state, planted with gobelet-trained Syrah as found in the northern Rh√¥ne. The hillside is steep, and rises in elevation from 950 to 1230 feet, on a piece of land that includes 9 distinct soil types due in part to the Missoula Floods. The soils are diverse and well-drained, ranging from deep Warden to very rocky Kiona soils. Calcium carbonate, a chief component of limestone, is present in much of the vineyard. Varietals grown include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Grenache, Cinsault, Counoise and Mourv√®dre. Due to the diversity of the soils in the vineyard, vine aspect, exposure and other factors, Force Majeure employs a diverse set of vine training systems, varietals and clonal selections. The hillside vineyard faces southwest and receives excellent afternoon sun exposure for ripening.

Taxonomy S. woodfordii was first collected in 1897 or 1898 on the island of Makira, also known as San Cristobal, in the Solomon Islands, by the German plant collector Wilhelm Micholitz. It was first described in 1898 under the name Livistona woodfordi by Henry Nicholas Ridley. Christine D. Bacon and William J. Baker moved the species to the resurrected genus Saribus in 2011. The name was later corrected to Livistona woodfordii. A holotype was never designated by Ridley, so a lectotype was selected by John Leslie Dowe in 2009. Dowe chose the specimen sheet in the The Natural History Museum in London, with isolectotypes designated in herbaria in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, Singapore Botanic Gardens and the Kew Herbarium. Description This plant is a hermaphrodite fan palm. It has a trunk up to in height, and diameter at breast height. The leaf or petiole scars are slightly raised, with irregular widths, and light grey in colour; the internodes between the scars are broad, and become greyish-brown to grey with age. The stubs of the petioles are not persistent, i.e. they do not remain clinging onto the trunk for long. =Similar species= Although Bacon and Baker do not provide a key to the nine species of Saribus, one can be found in the key provided by Dowe in his 2009 Livistona monograph, where the eight species which were transferred to Saribus are split from the rest in the beginning of the key. S. woodfordii keys out together with S. chocolatinus, S. papuanus and S. merrillii which all have inflorescences that divide to the third order. S. papuanus and S. merrillii have yellow flowers as opposed to red. S. woodfordii can be distinguished from S. chocolatinus by having somewhat hanging ends of the leaf segments, as opposed to rigid, a deeply undulate leaf blade. S. woodfordii has half as short inflorescence brachlets (rachillae) at 4 to 6cm long. These rachillae are also half as thick at 1mm. S. chocolatinus is furthermore the only species to have its rachillae covered throughout in tomentose indumentum -this is chocolate-brown at their bases, turning cream-green near their ends, whereas S. woodfordii only has tomentum at the bases of the rachillae, and this is coloured purplish-brown.

It is the only library in the city of Temple Terrace, FL, and it is part of the Hillsborough County Library Cooperative, along with branches in Tampa, Florida and Plant City, Florida, like the John F. Germany Public Library. It is located near several colleges, including the University of South Florida and Florida College, as well as the Museum of Science & Industry in Tampa. History The library was established on January 15, 1960 after the Temple Terrace Woman‚Äôs Club became inspired to create a community library. The local Boy Scout groups and city residents supplied the first book collection for this newly established library. Temple Terrace donated a small caddy house on the 19th tee of the city golf course to serve as the library. The original location on the golf course. The funding came from the Woman‚Äôs Club. Within a year, the collection and circulation had outgrown the caddy house. In April 1961, City Hall became the new location for the library. The city hall building is now a part of Florida College. The rise of library patrons and the demand for more services prompted the city to take over the library from the volunteers. The city appointed a Library Board, which made the Temple Terrace Public Library eligible to receive books from the Hillsborough County Library Service which allowed the Library's book collection to grow rapidly. In 1962, the Friends of the Temple Terrace Library (also known as \\"the Friends\\") were formed and became a Florida Corporation with tax exempt 501(C)(3) status in 1997.Temple Terrace, \\"Friends of the Library\\" The purpose of the group was to support the Library financially. Their efforts go towards providing secure equipment, furnishings, and materials that may not be available due to the limited budget of the library. Additionally, they promote the Library and its various service to the community. Since their inception, the Friends of the Temple Terrace Library have raised many thousands of dollars to support library services. The Friends of the Temple Terrace Library have also wrote, published, and sold a book on the history of the Temple Terrace area. On September 23, 1965, construction on a new, larger library began at 202 Bullard Parkway. The funds to purchase the land and construct the new library came from local, state, and federal funds. On April 17, 1966, the library opened its doors. The Women's Club provided money for the new customer service desk due to their ongoing interest in the project. In the mid 1970s, an additional 5,600 square feet were added to the existing structure to keep up with the number of patrons. The newly enlarged library was dedicated April 2, 1978. In 1998, the library was renovated and enlarged, and an online catalog and Internet access were added to the services available. Today the Temple Terrace Library has extensive resources with over 100,000 volumes and 52 patron computers. Currently The Temple Terrace Library has a partnership with the University of South Florida and the Tampa- Hillsborough County Libraries to make two Temple Terrace newspapers available digitally. The two collections are the Temple Terrace Sentinel and the Temple Terrace Beacon.Library Archives =Fire= A light fixture that melted in the 1982 fire now sits on display in the library. An arsonist set fire to the library in the morning of February 18, 1982. The blaze destroyed 11,666 books and 1,010 recordings within the library‚Äôs collection. However, the citizens and the Woman‚Äôs Club rallied and helped restore the library. It reopened in a temporary location, the Lightfoot Recreation Center, six weeks after the arson. Less than a year after the fire, on February 16, 1983, the new library was again open for business. =Book Nook= After the library was expanded and renovated in 1998, The Friends of the Temple Terrace Library (the \\"Friends\\") were able to realize one of their goals of opening a Book Nook.Temple Terrace Friends of the Library, \\"Friends of the Library\\" The Book Nook is a continuing fundraising activity which offers used books for sale.

The Book Nook is located in the main lobby of the Temple Terrace Library and is mainly operated by volunteers who are members of the Friends of the Temple Terrace Library, Inc, but it does have a small staff. Donated books are left in a drop-off box within the main lobby of the Library. =Beyond Books Lending Library= In spring 2016, the Temple Terrace Public Library began lending out more than just books and DVDs. Library patrons are able to check out items like cake pans, tools, board games, sewing machines, and much more, for one week at a time. All of these items have been donated and have helped make the library feel like a resource for the community when they need or want to use an item that they may not be able to purchase. = COVID-19 Pandemic = A sign near the entrance to the library informs patrons of rules during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The son of noted intellectual Ioannis Psycharis and grandson of liberal writer Ernest Renan, Psichari was baptised into the Greek Orthodox faith. After a troubled upbringing which saw him attempt suicide over an unrequited love, Psichari entered the army for his national service. Enjoying military life, he re-enlisted in the ranks and transferred to the Troupes coloniales in search of adventure abroad. He saw service in the French Congo and Mauritania and wrote a number of militaristic autobiographical works that proved popular with French nationalists. Converting to Catholicism in 1913, Psichari considered becoming a priest but instead decided he could better serve his church in the army. Fighting in the defence of Belgium in August 1914 during World War I, he was killed at Rossignol during the Battle of the Frontiers.  Early life  Ernest Psichari was born on 27 September 1883 in Paris. His father was the Greek-French Ioannis Psycharis, professor of Greek philology at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and one of the leading champions of Demotic Greek. His mother was No√©mi Psichari, daughter of the anti-clerical, liberal historian and philosopher Ernest Renan, one of the most famous intellectuals of 19th-century France. Born into one of the most famous republican families of France, he was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church at the insistence of his mother, though the family had a background of agnosticism. Psichari's parents argued much; his father was concerned that his children (he had a younger brother Michel and a sister Henriette) saw too little of him and knew only their mother and maternal grandfather. Psichari's parents eventually separated just prior to the First World War. Renan died in 1892 when Psichari was nine. Psichari grew close to contemporary intellectuals Maurice Barr√®s, Charles P√©guy and Jacques Maritain and, at the age of 19, fell in love with Maritain's sister Jeanne, seven years his senior. She rejected him for another and on her wedding day Psichari attempted to kill himself by an overdose of drugs. Rescued by his friend, Maurice Reclus (later a noted historian), he then attempted to shoot himself with a revolver. Reclus struggled to stop him and the weapon went off harmlessly. Afterwards, Psichari spent several days staying in run-down parts of Paris undertaking manual work before he was discovered by his family and sent to the country to recuperate.  Military service  Completing his compulsory military service as an enlisted soldier, Psichari found he enjoyed the discipline so much that he re-enlisted into the 51st Infantry Regiment in 1904, a move that outraged his friends. Rising to the rank of sergeant but growing impatient with the life of a garrison soldier in the metropolitan army, he arranged a transfer to the Troupes coloniales as an artilleryman. Psichari undertook a tour of duty in the Congo in 1907 under Lieutenant Lenfant, an officer whom he came to idolise. Returning to France in 1908, he published an account of his experiences as Terres de soleil et de sommeil (Lands of the sun and sleep). This was more of an autobiography than a work of travel writing or history and some claim that the writings contain homo-erotic references. He had by now rejected thoroughly the anti-militarism of his youth and praised his army and his nation, becoming an idol of the nationalist right. Having graduated from the Versailles military academy as a sub-lieutenant, he was posted to Mauritania in 1909, remaining there until 1912. Psichari initially feared that he would be bored in an area of the French colonies that was relatively pacified but soon grew to love the landscape and people of Mauritania. He would see action in a skirmish with tribesmen in which two of his men were killed. A frequent speaker against Renan's \\"dilettantism, his antagonism to the Catholic Church [and] his opposition to the military system\\", Psichari was concerned that his popularity with French nationalists arose simply because he had diverged so strongly from his grandfather's views. He wrote L‚ÄôAppel des armes (The Call to Arms) in 1913, a military novel that was a record of his experiences and proved immensely popular with nationalist youth. His works were said to \\"combine militaristic sentiments with a semimystical religious devotion\\".  Conversion and death  Psichari's tomb at Rossignol cemetery Perhaps due to emotional and mental stress, he turned increasingly to religion, converting to the Roman Catholic faith in early 1913. His new faith placed him at odds with his former mentor P√©guy, and the two cut off their ties. Psichari became a tertiary (lay) member of the Dominican Order and considered becoming a priest. Deciding he could better serve his church within the army, he instead followed it to war as a lieutenant, telling a priest at the time \\"we are not ready, but I have faith in the Sacred Heart\\". He died in the last stand of the French artillery at the Battle of Rossignol. Trapped between the German forces and the Semois River, the French gunners fought to the last, firing off the remainder of their ammunition, disabling their guns and killing their limber horses before surrendering. Psichari fell whilst defending the guns. Psichari's brother, also in arms since 1914, died with the French army in Champagne in 1917. Psichari's autobiographical novel, Le Voyage du centurion (The voyage of the centurion), that dealt with his conversion and \\"retraces his pilgrimage from scepticism to an ardent faith and a total abandonment to God\\" was published posthumously in 1916. A further work, Les voix qui crient dans le d√©sert : souvenirs d'Afrique (Voices crying in the wilderness: memories of Africa), was published in 1920 with a foreword by General Charles Mangin. Following his death he was portrayed by Henri Massis, his biographer, as a supporter of the far-right Action Fran√ßaise leader Charles Maurras, though Maritain considered he would have later broken away from the Maurrasians as Maritain did.

Damon tries to follow her but Alaric stops him and asks him to go home, lock the doors, and wait to deal with it until the morning when the full moon is gone. Bonnie goes to Luka (Bryton James) to apologize for channeling him and to return his talisman. Luka forgives her and agrees to help her unbind the spell from the moonstone. They set up everything they need and start chanting while the moonstone elevates and explodes in the air. Bonnie looks happy that they managed to break the moonstone and the spell. Tyler and Caroline are in the Lockwood cellar where Tyler installs new chains in the floor and walls to chain himself and Caroline mixes a wolfsbane cocktail for him. He chains himself up and tries to drink the cocktail while Caroline stays there to support him. As time passes, Tyler feels the pain and screams and asks Caroline to leave so he will not hurt her. Caroline tries to stay with him as much as she can but when the transformation begins, Tyler cannot control himself and she runs out of the cellar closing the door behind her so Tyler cannot get out. She runs into the woods and goes back to the cellar later to check up on Tyler. Tyler is back in his human form and Caroline gets back into the cellar to help him. Back at the Gilbert house, Jenna (Sara Canning) searches some files that Elena's mom was saving about the history of Mystic Falls, because she wants to help a \\"writer\\" who is working on a book. Elena seems fine with it and offers to help but she is terrified when she sees that the \\"writer\\" is Elijah (Daniel Gillies) and he is in the house. Elijah thanks Jenna for her help and pretends to leave. Elena runs to Jeremy's room to talk to him but Elijah stops her saying that he wants to talk to her. Elijah and Elena get in her room and he lets her know that he doesn't want to break the curse and that he also does not intend to hurt her or anyone she loves. He says that Klaus has become paranoid over the years and he just wants to find where he is so he can kill him. Elijah wants to use Elena as bait to draw Klaus out and he makes a deal with Elena: she is to stop trying to kill herself and he will keep her family safe in return. Elena agrees but wants one more favor from him. Luka returns to his home where Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin) is waiting for him. Jonas asks if he was successful and Luka responds in the affirmative and gives him the moonstone that he and Bonnie supposedly destroyed. Luka does not seem really fine that he had to fool Bonnie and after he gives the moonstone to Jonas he turns to leave. Jonas stops him telling him that Elijah wants them to do one more thing for him. Damon is back at the Salvatore house where he finds Rose (Lauren Cohan) waiting for him. She apologizes for fleeing Slater's apartment when Elijah appeared and while they are talking they hear a noise of glass breaking. A werewolf breaks into the house and tries to attack Damon but Rose gets into the way and the werewolf bites her instead. Damon stabs the wolf with a sword and the injured wolf escapes. Damon checks up on Rose and they see that the bite starts healing. They are both relieved that the myth about the werewolf bite being fatal for vampires was not true. Meanwhile, Stefan (Paul Wesley) is still stuck in the tomb with Katherine who tries to seduce him by invading his mind. Stefan wakes up and tells her to stay out of his head. They start talking with Stefan asking her to apologize for all the things she did but Katherine does not apologize. She tells him that she loves him and to prove it she tells him that Isobel, Elena's birth mother, can help him find Klaus. Their conversation is interrupted by Elijah who comes to the tomb to free Stefan. Elijah explains that he made a deal with Elena which she will explain to him and he is now free to exit the tomb since Elijah had the spell lifted. Stefan gets out of the tomb and Katherine tries to follow him but Elijah blocks her way and compels her to stay in there unless he tells her otherwise. He wants to make sure that Klaus will know exactly where she is when he comes to town. Katherine begs Stefan to not leave her in there but Stefan walks away to go find Elena and the two of them make up and are back together. The episode ends with Damon apologizing to Rose for picking a fight with a werewolf that led to her getting bitten. Rose is just relieved that the myth was not real and the two of them agree to stay friends with benefits. They start to kiss but Rose feels pain on her shoulder, where the werewolf bit her. They check on her shoulder and they see that the area is not exactly healed and they look at each other with fear and confusion in their eyes.

Emma Fraser from TV Over Mind gave an A rating to the episode saying that it was chock-full of story and emotion. \\"This was the night that focused on the wolf mythology which allowed this story to shine, really terrific work from all those involved. The Elena thread has moved along nicely and whilst seeing her rebel from those protecting her is an interesting angle it will be welcome to see her being less impulsive in her attempts at protection. With a new problem with the unknown effect of a wolf bite the next episode should be a treat.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that the episode was a typically overstuffed one, full of plot developments and intriguing character pairings. \\"As a mid-season finale, the ending was something of a letdown, especially for a show that thrives on shocking its audience in the last few minutes of so many episodes. But with several weeks before the next new Vampire Diaries, maybe it is for the best that we are not left with a more riveting cliffhanger.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.9/5 saying that it was not exactly the most action-packed episode and an overall letdown since this was the mid-season finale episode. However, Richenthal praised Michael Trevino and those who were involved in Tyler's transformation scene: \\"Full props, however, must be given to Michael Trevino, and, really, everyone involved in that transformation scene. It was intense and agonizing to watch... in the best possible way.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that the werewolf transformation elevated a disjointed episode. \\"The strength of the transition sequence in this episode elevates it above the average. However, the episode would have been stronger had it been more unified and cohesive and had it tried to cover less ground.\\" Shannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode saying that it was entertaining but she also feels like it was a bit of a letdown. \\"As much as I love this show, it deserves a big come on this week. After a week of titillating previews of Stefan and Katherine mauling each other, it all turns out to be just a dream. What a letdown.\\" Meg of Two Cents TV also gave a good review saying that this was a great episode. \\"I thought this episode did a good job of moving the story forward past [...] We‚Äôre moving forward on the road to Klaus and the werewolf storyline just keeps getting more interesting.\\" References External links * 2010 American television episodes The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"By the Light of the Moon (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"42540091","text":"Bangladesh‚ÄìYemen relations are the bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Yemen.

Biography  = Early life and career = Don Sherwood, a native of rural New York, turned a childhood love of drawing into a six-decade career as a cartoonist and illustrator. Born on September 12, 1930, Sherwood quickly was enthralled by radio and movie entertainment, and the adventures of heroes such as The Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy fueled his artistic imagination. As a teenager, Sherwood sent samples of his art to Chester Gould, the creator of Dick Tracy. Gould was impressed and wrote back, telling Sherwood that he had talent and encouraging him to move to Gould's city of Chicago to study the craft. Sherwood took the advice, leaving high school and enrolling at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. While in Chicago, Sherwood visited Gould regularly to observe his cartooning habits and worked as a copy boy at the Chicago Daily News. Also at that time, Sherwood enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. He was called into active duty and fought with the First Marine Division in the Korean War, spending 18 months in combat operations in the Korean mountainside. The experience had a transformative effect on Sherwood, who developed a deep respect and appreciation for the Corps and its values. Upon returning to the United States, Sherwood moved to New York and resumed his young cartooning career by working as a bylined staff artist for the New York Mirror, as an illustrator on the comic strips Cotton Woods (General Features) and Will Chance (Columbia Features),Sherwood entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed Oct. 26, 2018. and then as an assistant for George Wunder on the adventure strip Terry and the Pirates. However, he longed to create a strip of his own and to showcase the bravery of the United States Marines. = Dan Flagg = In 1963, at the age of 32, Sherwood did just that, launching Dan Flagg. The strip, featuring a Marine hero, was an instant success, appearing in 400 newspapers and in most major metropolitan markets, including the New York Daily News, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post. It was originally syndicated with the McNaught Syndicate, later moving to Bell-McClure.Holtz, Allan. \\"Don Sherwood's Dan Flagg,\\" Stripper's Guide (December 03, 2005). The creation of Dan Flagg launched Sherwood forward in his profession. He was invited to lunch with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House, joining four other famed military cartoonists (Milton Caniff, Mort Walker, Bill Mauldin and Wunder). He was a presenter at the 1964 World's Fair in New York, and \\"Dan Flagg Day\\" ceremonies were held in New York City and Philadelphia. Sherwood researched his strip exhaustively, visiting Marine installations, talking to recruits and generals, and studying the Corps and the subjects of planned storylines. As a result, Sherwood was commended for the authenticity of his artwork (after one strip contained a drawing of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India, Sherwood received a letter from the architect of the building, Edward Durell Stone, praising its accuracy) and for the timeliness of his storylines (after one adventure involving Cuban relations, a group seeking to oust Fidel Castro wrote to Sherwood to ask for Dan Flagg's cooperation). Sherwood consistently appeared on behalf of the Marine Corps, with whom he shared a mutual respect; the Marine Corps Commandant, David Shoup, met with Sherwood and called him \\"a master of his art.\\" Among his commendations, Sherwood received a plaque from the U.S. Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association and a citation from the National Press Club. As Dan Flagg continued to establish its place in newspapers in the mid-1960s, Sherwood was approached by Universal Studios about having the Marine hero appear in another medium‚Äîtelevision. Sherwood had modeled Dan Flagg after his movie hero, Robert Taylor, and Taylor agreed to star as Dan Flagg in the proposed television series. Taylor visited Sherwood at his home in Oneonta, New York, appearing at the city's \\"Dan Flagg Day\\" ceremony. However, with war escalating in Vietnam, public sentiment for military-themed entertainment was turning. A Dan Flagg television deal was not finalized, and by mid-1967 the Marine legend retired from active duty. = Later career = During the 1970s, Sherwood worked in a variety of media. He handled character design for Hanna-Barbera Productions, created storyboards for Columbia Pictures, and wrote and illustrated comic books including The Partridge Family and The Phantom for Charlton Comics. Sherwood also drew upon his fondness for the popular culture of his youth in creating the syndicated nostalgia feature Return With Us To ..., which appeared in more than 350 newspapers. Additionally, he collaborated with writer Louis Lomax on the proposed feature Deadline and with Carlton E. Morse on an adaptation of his old-time radio program, I Love a Mystery, which ultimately was published as a graphic novel. Beginning in 1981, Sherwood illustrated the comic-strip feature Sergeant Preston of the Yukon for Lone Ranger Television. He again spent months of research in developing the strip, visiting the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Alaska State Troopers. Following the run of the Mountie-hero feature, the latest in his line of adventure strips, Sherwood displayed his versatility by writing and illustrating the comic-strip version of The Flintstones for several years. He continued to showcase his distinct illustrative style and sharp, clear lines in producing work for Archie Comics, the Roy Rogers Museum, The National Broadcasters Hall of Fame, and other outlets. After leaving Bedrock, Sherwood approached Dick Clark about adapting his syndicated radio program Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember for the Sunday comics page. Clark agreed and, together with Clark and writer Fred Bronson, Sherwood produced the Sunday feature, which appeared in top newspapers including the New York Daily News and the Chicago Sun-Times. Clark later would option Dan Flagg for a television project, bringing Sherwood's career full circle. Sherwood died on March 6, 2010, still pursuing his childhood love of drawing at the age of 79. He was buried with full military honors at Quantico National Cemetery. From the cemetery, the sound of Sherwood's beloved Marines performing military exercises at the adjacent base may be heard.

Thornton was a rebellious character whom from a young age was involved in a Nationalist movement. Her first small involvement was selling badges and flags at the O'Donovan Rossa funeral. Personal life Brigid Lyons Thornton was born in Northyard Scramogue, County Roscommon in 1896. She was the daughter of farmer and Fenian Patrick Lyons. At a young age, Brigid moved to Longford to live with her uncle Frank McGuinness and his wife Kate, who paid for her secondary school education. McGuinness is credited for Thornton's keen interest in politics and Irish history. In November 1934 Frank McGuinness died, having been a senator for five years and a renowned figure for his involvement in Irish history. Brigid Lyons Thornton was a medical student and a member of Cumman na mBan who was involved with the Irish Volunteers during 1916. She was arrested during the Easter Rising and interned in Kilmainham Gaol along with other members of the Irish Volunteers. Revolutionary She graduated from medical school, Galway in 1922 being the youngest medical student there. She became the only commissioned female officer ever in the new Irish Free State Army. She and Edward Thornton met when Brigid became ill with tuberculosis and was sent to Switzerland with other officers who had a similar condition. During this time Thornton learned how to treat Tuberculosis while she was a patient. This would be a significant advantage in later years. She took her diploma in public health in 1927 and then entered the public health service. She began in the public health service, County Kildare, later moving to County Cork until she finally ended up in Dublin where she worked until retirement. Brigid Thornton helped to treat many infectious diseases. Marriage Thornton married captain Edward Thornton on 10 October 1925, in Dublin, at the Chapel of St Kevin in the Pro Cathedral. The ceremony was a quiet reunion of family and friends. Her husband returned to Switzerland to heal from TB and was later released and cured. He became a lawyer. Thornton attended the National University in 1947 and finished a postgraduate degree in Public Health. Thornton was very passionate about her work in the public health system in Ireland, she resided permanently on home ground; meanwhile her husband resided in Switzerland for most of the winter months, he worked as a lawyer and their relationship was maintained through letter writing and yearly visits form Captain Thornton to Ireland. They are buried alongside each other in Toomore Cemetery. 1916 Easter Rising Brigid returns to Longford when she hears the news of The 1916 Easter Rising. Her uncle Joe McGuinness was serving in the Four Courts along with Patrick Pearse, James Connolly and Michael Collins. Brigid decides to join with Uncle Frank and the volunteers he had gathered in Dublin for the week. Their car was believed to be rejected to enter the Four Courts and by some means the crew was able to pass the barricade, and Brigid along with Cumann na mBan provided food and took care of the wounded rebels. She acted as a nurse to the First Battalion of volunteers who had taken possession of the Four Courts and adjoining streets. After the surrender, she was put in jail in Kilmainham with her comrades and during the imprisonment, she heard that 14 of her idols were shot. After her release from the jail, she returned to continue studying medicine in Galway.  Revolutionary activities  The involvement of Thornton in female activist activities in the late ninetieth century was a feat in itself as politics, religion and education were a conservative male-dominated preserve. Patriotism found her involved in Sinn F√©in and Cumann na mBan. Women were limited by their male counterparts in the scope of their revolutionary activities. In spite of this Thornton contributed as a rebel, soldier and commissioned medical officer. In 1917 she set up a group of Cumann na mBan in Galway. Despite her revolutionary activities as a dispatch carrier and involvement in the Easter Rising in 1916, which subsequently saw her imprisonment, Thornton qualified in 1922 at the rank of First Officer. Later she was commissioned by Michael Collins to become the first and only woman to be accepted as a female officer in the Free State Army. She was part of the medical services that formed the corps, when it was time to establish a permanent, new all Irish Medical Service in 1922.John Cowell, A Nootide Blazing, Brigid Lyons Thornton, Rebel, soldier, Doctor  Medical career  Thornton dedicated her life to both revolutionary activities and the medical sector; she was a practitioner, lecturer and researcher. Her involvement as a doctor was not only hospital work, but also as a volunteer. She was an avid educator of women on the importance of hygiene in the development of children and factors of disease that flourished in the impoverished slums of the inner city and surrounding suburbs. This work was marginalised by the lack of funds for a public health service to help ordinary people. Clean water was a commodity at this time and a strain of gastroenteritis was the cause of death of many babies. In her youth Thornton had expressed the passion to become a teacher but as women's role in society changed, society's constraints became less stringent, she could study medicine and pursue greater participation in this area. This devotion and patriotism to her country established her name in history. This involvement matched her commitment to revolution. Lyons acquired a county scholarship to study an undergraduate degree in Medicine in University College Galway in 1917, where she graduated in 1922. She also received a Postgraduate Diploma in public health from The National University of Ireland in 1927, known as University College Dublin (UCD). In the 1950s when vaccines were developed and distributed to the general public, Thornton helped combat the Tuberculosis epidemic in Ireland and became involved in the pioneering of the BGG vaccination as she herself had been plagued by the illness alongside her husband Edward. A team of fifteen members were dispersed throughout Ireland setting out to accomplish what would become a massive feat in medical history. She dedicated her life to working in the public sector; in a number of areas including the Kildare and Cork Boards of Health as a medical officer, and she was an assistant medical officer for the Dublin Health Authority. Her other work titles included medical inspector at the Carnegie Centre in Dublin. Later life During her life, Thornton as in her youth was a passionate contributed to the welfare of the people. She was a librarian in the Rotunda Hospital, where she was an advisor to the new doctors and was always up to date on new medical practices which were necessary in an age of medical discovery. Thornton was heavily involved in the Medical Benevolent Fund. Thornton's retirement days were spent as a researcher in Trinity College Dublin.  Death  Thornton lived a long life, surviving her husband Captain Edward Thornton who died in 1946, the couple had no children. She had suffered ill health in her late seventies and retired, nevertheless, she continued to work as a volunteer in The Rotunda Maternity Hospital. Lyons died of cardiac- respiratory arrest, as stated on her death certificate, on 15 November 1987 at the age of 91. Thornton was buried on the 71st anniversary of the Easter Rising in Toomore Cemetery, Foxford, County Mayo. Members of the Western Command rendered her military honours at her burial and her coffin was draped in the tricolour.

History =1990‚Äì1993= When Telecinco began as a private television network in 1990, it decided to enhance its character as entertainment and fun television at the expense of its informative aspect. About two months after the debut the network decided to begin its newscasts. Valerio Lazarov, then the director of the network, hired Luis Mari√±as (then one of the presenters of TVE's Telediario) as news director and, on 3 May 1990, started a 15-minutes late- night newscast titled Entre hoy y ma√±ana (\\"between today and tomorrow\\"). On 8 September 1990, the newscast started broadcasting on weekends and in the following two years the sole newscast of the network began surpassing in ratings the iconic Telediario (then presented by Mat√≠as Prats) and Antena 3 Noticias (then presented by Jos√© Mar√≠a Carrascal). On 6 July 1992, Telecinco premiered its midday newscast titled Hoy (\\"Today\\") presented by Mari√±as, while Julio Fern√°ndez began presenting Entre hoy y ma√±ana and Felipe Mellizo debuted on the weekend newscast. =1993‚Äì1998= In April 1993, there was a major revamp of Telecinco news services. To extend the length, all newscasts were retitled as Las Noticias (\\"The News\\"). Miguel √Ångel Aguilar replaced Felipe Mellizo on weekends, later Luis Mari√±as moved to the evening newscast while Carmen Tom√°s began anchoring on middays. During the 1994‚Äì95 season, Luis Mari√±as stayed in the evening newscast, Tom√°s on middays while Fernando √ìnega debuted on the late-night newscast. Jos√© Ribagorda and Mar√≠a Jos√© S√°ez presented at weekends. During the following season, Tom√°s resigned, √ìnega moved to middays, Mari√±as again moved to evenings while Ribagorda and J. J.

I√±aki Gabilondo, the former head of news services on TVE, began a daily interview section on the evening edition. In January 1997, Telecinco started another major revamp. Miguel √Ångel Aguilar left the network, being replaced by Carlos Carnicero. √ìnega moved to Antena 3 and both Ribagorda and Santos moved to TVE. Juan Ram√≥n Lucas and Montserrat Dom√≠nguez debuted on the 14:30 edition, Mari√±as stayed on the 20:30 edition and Juan Pedro Valent√≠n moved to the overnight edition in March 1997. Weekend newscasts were presented by √Ångels Barcel√≥. In September 1997, coinciding with the makeover of the network, the generic title Informativos Telecinco was adopted, but Las Noticias and Entre hoy y ma√±ana maintained their titles. Mari√±as left the network shortly after, being replaced by Juan Ram√≥n Lucas. Valent√≠n stayed on the overnights while Montserrat Dom√≠nguez moved to weekends. Later Dom√≠nguez moved to overnights and Ferm√≠n Bocos debuted on weekends. During this season Telecinco premiered the morning newsmagazine La Mirada Cr√≠tica, hosted by Vicente Vall√©s and the morning newscast presented by Gloria Serra and Juan Antonio Villanueva =1998‚Äì2001= Informativos Telecinco took away the individual names of each edition. In September 1998, the midday, evening and weekend newscasts appeared with a new set, while the overnight and morning editions came from a set in the Telecinco's newsroom. During this season all presenters remained in their respective posts. In February 1999, Vicente Vall√©s and √Ångeles Blanco replaced Ferm√≠n Bocos on weekends. In September 2000, Juan Pedro Valent√≠n was hired as head of the news services of Telecinco. In February 2001, Montserrat Dom√≠nguez debuted as host of La Mirada Cr√≠tica. In July 2001, Lucas left the network and moved to Antena 3. =2001‚Äì2006= Telecinco opted to have an individual presenter on all editions and a co-presenter to explain the news that was presented. Hilario Pino, coming from CNN+, debuted on the midday edition along with Carme Chaparro. Barcel√≥ and Agust√≠n Hern√°ndez debuted on the evening edition. Weekend editions were presented by √Ångeles Blanco and Fernando Olmeda. M√†xim Huerta took over the midnight edition while Rafa Fern√°ndez and Ana Rodr√≠guez presented in the mornings. In September 2004, Bego√±a Chamorro replaced Chaparro, the latter replaced Blanco on weekends. Jos√© Luis Fuentecilla joined the morning newscast along with M√†xim Huerta. One year later, Barcel√≥ and Montserrat Dom√≠nguez both left Telecinco. Juan Pedro Valent√≠n temporarily replaced Barcel√≥ with Alejandra Herranz and Blanco. √Ålvaro Rivas and Luc√≠a Rodil took over the mornings. Ana Rodr√≠guez worked on overnights and Vicente Vall√©s returned to La Mirada Cr√≠tica. Poor ratings performances of the evening edition caused the network to cut it 25 minutes and moved it to 21:00, putting it in direct competition with its rival networks. Valent√≠n remained as sole presenter of this edition but the poor ratings continued. In January 2006, Valent√≠n was fired and Pedro Piqueras was hired as new head of the news services. =2006‚Äìpresent= With Piqueras (coming from RNE) as new director of news services, Telecinco began climbing in the ratings. Hilario Pino remained as sole presenter on middays and Piqueras took over the evening editions. Jos√© Ribagorda returned to the network to present the weekend editions with Carme Chaparro. Agust√≠n Hern√°ndez joined Luc√≠a Rodil on the morning newscast. The long medical leave of Pino was covered temporarily by Bego√±a Chamorro and then by √Ångeles Blanco. In September 2006, Yolanda Ben√≠tez replaced Rodil in the mornings. During this season, the weekend midday edition was moved to 15:00 hours and reduced in duration. In September 2007, Blanco began presenting and directing the morning edition with Daniel G√≥mez. In December 2007, the weekday midday edition was also reduced and moved to 15:00 and Marta Fern√°ndez began presenting it. Again, bad rating performances on the midday edition caused it to be moved again to the 14:30 slot beginning in September 2008. Vicente Vall√©s left La Mirada Cr√≠tica and was replaced by Mar√≠a Teresa Campos. Yolanda Ben√≠tez was her substitute during her medical leave. A major move of presenters occurred in September 2009: Pedro Piqueras moved to the midday newscast, Jos√© Ribagorda moved to the evening edition with Marta Fern√°ndez and J. J. Santos as sports presenter, Carme Chaparro remained as sole anchor on weekends and a new 0800 newscast presented by Pino began in that season, following the cancellation of La Mirada Cr√≠tica. A year later former, the Telediario presenter David Cantero joined the network, causing another major move of presentes, with Pino in the mornings, David Cantero and Marta Fern√°ndez at midday (with Sara Carbonero as sports presenter). Pedro Piqueras returned to the evening edition while Chaparro and Ribagorda remained on weekends. Following the fusion on Telecinco and Cuatro in January 2011, Pino moved to the noon edition of Noticias Cuatro and Concha Garc√≠a Campoy replaced him. In July 2011, Isabel Jim√©nez joined Cantero on the midday edition and a month later Leticia Iglesias debuted on the morning edition and in December began as sole presenter after the medical leave of Garc√≠a Campoy.

Cecil Harwood was the youngest of five children born into the household of a pastor. He attended school together with Owen Barfield, who became his life-long friend and co-worker in many areas of his life. Together they studied at Oxford University and were part of the circle of the Inklings that included C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien. His friendship with Daphne Olivier, who later became his wife, led him to meet Rudolf Steiner and subsequently, to found the first Waldorf school in England, the so-called ‚ÄúNew School‚Äù that later became Michael Hall, together with her and three other colleagues. He remained connected to the school for the rest his life.New book details the history of a remarkable Sussex School Daphne and he had had five children and had worked together for over 25 years when she died in 1950. In the meantime, in 1948, a Swedish/English eurythmist by the name of Marguerite Lundgren had begun working in England, who was dedicated to English-language eurythmy and had become friends with both Owen Barfield and the Harwoods. She and Harwood married in 1953, beginning another fruitful co-work as they built up the eurythmy work in England with performances, international tours, the London School of Eurythmy and finally the book on which they collaborated with Marjorie Raff√©, Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance.Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance by Marjorie Raff√©, Cecil Harwood, Marguerite Lundgren. Illustrations by Rudolf Steiner, Rudolf Steiner Press 1975 , 9780854402786 Harwood had joined the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain shortly after meeting Rudolf Steiner for the first time in 1924. In 1937 he became its chairman and General Secretary, a position he carried until 1974. In this capacity he was instrumental not just in developing the work in the United Kingdom but also in re-establishing the international relationships within the Anthroposophical Society as a whole after the internal difficulties of the 1930s and 1940s. This implied a certain amount of travel, which he undertook not just on behalf of the Society but also in assisting the growth and development of Waldorf education worldwide and in particular, in the United States.Cecil Harwood - Biographischer Eintrag in der Online-Dokumentation der anthroposophischen Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls He was founder and for many years editor of Child and Man, the journal of the Waldorf Steiner schools in Great Britain, as well as writing one of the definitive works on Waldorf Education for the English-speaking world: The Recovery of Man in Childhood. Besides this, he translated into English certain central works of Anthroposophical life from Rudolf Steiner‚Äôs original formulations. These were the Calendar of the Soul, a cycle of meditations through the changing seasons of the year; the Services of The Christian Community and the three texts of the Oberuferer Weihenachtsspiele, traditional Christmas plays from the village of Oberufer in today‚Äôs Slovakia. His friendship with Owen Barfield and C.S. Lewis has been well-recorded in the biographies written on these two personalities. It seems to have been a fruitful relationship throughout, influencing the work and thought of all three.C. S.

The park was officially completed and opened on 18 September 1993, by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Tom√°s MacGiolla. The memorial represents a circular pool with a bronze sculpture of a dancing couple in the middle, and the memorial was designed by the sculptor, Robin Buick. Water is pumped by 48 jets in the illuminated fountain which surrounds the sculpture. The fountain is enclosed by 48 pillars, each pillar representing a person lost in the tragedy. In the memorial park, there is a number of facilities open to the public including a newly renovated playground and a garden terrace. The park comprises 20 acres along the Santry River. The land was originally a 12th-century monastic site. History, and development The cost of the park was in excess of ¬£500,000 Irish pounds and was partly funded by the Irish government. The design was prepared in 1991, and work on site commenced in February 1992 with a combination of contract work, direct labour and a community youth training project which was operating through F√ÅS, the state agency in charge of assisting citizens seeking employment. The major works were carried out by Dublin Corporation's Parks Department with input from various divisions. The park is enclosed with a mild steel railing on a plinth wall, and the entrances are defined by piers of limestone which are of a similar design to that used in the memorial. 8,050 trees were planted, most of which were 11 years old making them as old as the incident in 1981. =Facilities= The park has a playground, an all-weather pitch which has been renovated by the Dublin City Council in late 2015, a football pitch and a garden terrace with seating. Various bridges are placed over the River Santry which runs directly through the park into a small lake in the middle where a small island is present which is the home to many birds including swans and ducks. There are various seating areas around the park, primarily facing the park for passers-by who want to feed the animals.

Revised 2012 Mechanism The mechanisms by which endometriosis may cause infertility are not clearly understood, particularly when the extent of endometriosis is low. Still possible mechanisms include: *Anatomical distortions and adhesions (the fibrous bands that form between tissues and organs following recovery from an injury) *The release of factors from endometriotic cysts which are detrimental to gametes or embryos. An endometriotic cyst contains free iron, reactive oxygen species, proteolytic enzymes and inflammatory molecules. Follicular density in tissue surrounding the endometriotic cyst has been consistently shown to be significantly lower than in healthy ovaries, and to a degree that does not appear to be caused merely by the stretching of surrounding tissues owing to the presence of a cyst. The other way around, endometriosis may more likely develop in women who fail to conceive for other reasons and thus be a secondary phenomenon. For this reason it is preferable to speak of \\"endometriosis-associated infertility\\" rather than any definite \\"infertility caused by endometriosis\\" by the same reason that association does not imply causation. Management =Surgery= In younger women with unfulfilled reproductive potential, surgical treatment attempts to remove endometriotic tissue and preserve the ovaries without damaging normal tissue. Surgery is more effective for infertility than hormonal suppression for endometriosis. Surgery enhances the chances of conceiving naturally during the 12-18 ensuing months. The use of medical suppression after surgery for minimal/mild endometriosis has not shown benefits for patients with infertility. =Intrauterine Insemination= The use of fertility medication that stimulates ovulation (clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins) combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) enhances fertility in these patients as does assisted reproduction. =In vitro fertilization= In-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures are effective in improving fertility in many women with endometriosis. IVF makes it possible to combine sperm and eggs in a laboratory and then place the resulting embryos into the woman's uterus. The decision when to apply IVF in endometriosis-associated infertility cases takes into account the age of the patient, the severity of the endometriosis, the presence of other infertility factors, and the results and duration of past treatments. In ovarian hyperstimulation as part of IVF in women with endometriosis, using a standard GnRH agonist protocol has been found to be equally effective in regard to using a GnRH antagonist protocol in terms of pregnancy rate. On the other hand, when using a GnRH agonist protocol, long- term (three to six months) pituitary down-regulation before IVF for women with endometriosis has been estimated to increase the odds of clinical pregnancy by fourfold. No difference has been found between surgery (cystectomy or aspiration) versus expectant management, or between ablation versus cystectomy, prior to IVF in women with endometriosis.

She saw action as a convoy escort during the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Havre-Saint-Pierre, Quebec, whose name was shortened due to its length. After the war she was sold to Peru and renamed Teniente Palacios in 1947. St. Pierre was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 30 June 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched on 1 December later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 August 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia, St. Pierre underwent four months of repairs. She finally set out to work up at Bermuda in March 1945 and in April set out for the United Kingdom having been assigned to escort group EG 9. In May she was to escort Russia-bound convoys, but instead was detached and was sent to escort surrendered U-boats bound for Loch Eriboll. At the end of May, St. Pierre returned to Canada to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant installing water-cooling and refrigeration abilities and changing the camouflage pattern. On 4 June 1945 the work was begun at Lauzon but was cancelled on 20 August due to the surrender of Japan. She was paid off 22 November 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and laid up at Shelburne in reserve. Postwar service St. Pierre underwent a minor refit at Dartmouth in 1947 at the cost of $200,000 after being sold to the Peruvian Navy. From there she sailed to Peru where she was recommissioned as the Teniente Palacios. She was renamed as Palacios in 1953. In 1954 she was sent to the United States to have her armament and fire control upgraded. She was discarded in 1966 and broken up. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

She was also a visiting professor of ancient philosophy at Oxford University, and a senior research fellow at Merton College, Oxford University. Education and career Fine earned her B.A. from the University of Michigan (1971); and her MA (1973) and PhD from Harvard University (1975). She also holds an MA from Oxford University (2009). She taught at Cornell University since 1975 until her retirement. She is the recipient of fellowships from the NEH and ACLS. In 1992, she won Cornell's Clark Award for distinguished teaching. Gail Fine is married to Terence Irwin, who was the professor of the history of philosophy at Oxford University and a fellow of Keble College, Oxford. In 2013, the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell held a conference in honor of Gail Fine and Terence Irwin. She is the daughter of the American historian Sidney Fine. Philosophical work Fine specializes in ancient philosophy. Fine's first book, On Ideas: Aristotle‚Äôs Criticism of Plato‚Äôs Theory of Forms, is the first full-length book in English to discuss Aristotle's lost essay Peri Ide√¥n (On Ideas). The essay survives only in fragments preserved by the Greek commentator Alexander, in his commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics. In it, Aristotle formulates and criticizes a number of arguments for the existence of Platonic forms. Fine analyzes the arguments Aristotle ascribes to Plato and assesses his criticisms of them, asking whether he correctly interprets Plato's arguments for and views about the nature and existence of forms. She also considers aspects of Aristotle's alternative epistemological and metaphysical views, and relates both his and Plato's views to contemporary issues in metaphysics, such as the distinction between universals and particulars, the range of universals, and whether they can exist uninstantiated. Fine's second book, Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays, collects 15 articles on Plato's metaphysics and epistemology. Among the topics these essays consider are Meno's paradox; knowledge and belief in Republic 5-7; the Theaeteteus; the separation of forms; whether forms are immanent; and forms as causes. Both On Ideas and Plato on Knowledge and Forms were the subject of book symposia at sessions of the American Philosophical Association. Her third book, The Possibility of Inquiry: Meno's Paradox from Socrates to Sextus was published by Oxford University Press in 2014. She is also the editor of The Oxford Handbook of Plato (Oxford University Press, 2008) and of Plato 1 and 2 in the Oxford Readings in Philosophy series (1999). She is perhaps best known for her work in four main areas: #Meno's paradox. Fine argues that Meno's paradox is valid but contains a false premise, viz. that one can't inquire into what one doesn't know. For mere true beliefs aren‚Äôt knowledge but, if one has and relies on them, one can inquire and discover; prior knowledge (in this life) isn't needed. She also argues, against a familiar view, that the theory of recollection doesn't posit innate knowledge (or true beliefs or concepts), but only prenatal knowledge. She defends her current views on Meno's Paradox in her recent book, The Possibility of Inquiry: Meno‚Äôs Paradox from Socrates to Sextus (Oxford, 2014), where she discusses not only the Meno but also replies to Meno's Paradox in Aristotle, the Epicureans and Stoics, and Sextus. #Knowledge and belief in Republic 5. Fine challenges the traditional view that Plato extensively argues a \\"Two Worlds Theory\\", according to which one can know, but not have beliefs about forms; and one can have beliefs about, but not know, sensibles. Fine argues, by contrast, that Plato argues only that, to have any knowledge at all, one must know forms, but one can then use that knowledge so as to know sensibles as well. Fine also argues that Plato allows beliefs about both forms and sensibles. #Her work on Aristotle's criticism of Plato, especially in her book On Ideas (see above), but also in various articles. In, for example, \\"Separation\\", she argues that when Aristotle criticizes Plato for separating forms, he means just that Plato takes forms to be capable of existing without being instantiated; since forms are universals, this means that he allows universals to exist uninstantiated. Though the view that universals can exist uninstantiated is controversial, it is not clear why Aristotle treats it with such hostility; the explanation, Fine argues, has to do with Aristotle's own metaphysical commitments. On this notion of separation, forms can be both separate and immanent and, in Fine's view, Plato thinks they are both, unlike many scholars who think separation and immanence are incompatible. Fine's views on separation have often been discussed.D. Morison, 'Separation in Aristotle's Metaphysics', Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy (1985), 125-157; and his 'Separation: A Reply to Fine', Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy (1985), 167-173. #Her defense of the view that Plato accepts a coherentist account of justification, a view she takes Plato to defend in (among other works) the Republic and Theaetetus. Her work on this topic has often been discussed, ranging from A. Nehamas, \\"Episteme and Logos in Plato‚Äôs Later Thought\\", Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Philosophie 66 (1984), 11-36 to C.C.W. Taylor, \\"Plato‚Äôs Epistemology\\" and M. Lee, Theaetetus, both in the Oxford Handbook of Plato.

She is also co-editor of The Epistemology of Testimony and The Epistemology of Disagreement: New Essays.Taylor and Francis Online - The Epistemology of Disagreement: New Essays by Christensen, David and Lackey, Jennifer (eds.) Education Lackey graduated from Saint Mary's College in 1994 with a B.A. in philosophy and from the University of Chicago in 1995 with an M.A. in philosophy. In 2000, she graduated from Brown University with a Ph.D. in philosophy under the supervision of Ernest Sosa. Research areas Lackey‚Äôs primary research interests lie in social epistemology. She is known for arguing against the traditional view of testimony, according to which testimony is a merely transmissive, rather than a generative, epistemic source. On this view, hearers can acquire knowledge on the basis of testimony only if the speakers themselves possess the knowledge in question and thus testimony transmits knowledge from one person to another without being able to generate knowledge in its own right. In Learning from Words: Testimony as a Source of Knowledge, Lackey uses her widely discussed creationist teacher case to argue that the standard view is false and that testimony can in fact be generative. In this case, a creationist teacher rejects all of the evidence supporting evolutionary theory and thus fails to either believe or know that modern day Homo sapiens evolved from Homo erectus, but nevertheless reliably conveys this fact about Homo sapiens to her students. This shows that the teacher imparts knowledge to her students that she fails to possess herself. Lackey then advances a theory of the epistemology of testimony that focuses on the linguistic or communicative items in testimonial exchanges, such as statements and other acts of communication, rather than the internal states of speakers, such as states of knowing and believing. In other work, Lackey argues that reasonableness, rather than knowledge, is the norm of assertion, that memory is a generative epistemic source, and that lying requires deception. Lackey is also known for arguing against the claim central to virtue epistemology that knowledge should be understood in terms of the knower‚Äôs deserving credit for the truth of her belief. Lackey argues that the virtue epistemologist faces a dilemma: either the standards for deserving credit for a true belief are relatively high, or they are relatively low. If they are relatively high, then the virtue epistemologist cannot account for instances of knowledge from testimony, where the credit for the hearer‚Äôs true belief goes to the speaker. On the other hand, if the standards are relatively low, then the virtue epistemologist cannot distinguish between cases of genuine knowledge and Gettier cases where a person has a justified true belief by accident. Awards and fellowships Lackey has received a number of awards, including a Charles A. Ryskamp Research Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Young Epistemologist Prize, and an Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities Fellowship.

The goal of TF-CBT is to provide psychoeducation to both the child and the non-offending caregivers and help them to identify and cope with emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Research has shown TF-CBT to be effective in treating childhood PTSD and with children who have experienced traumatic events.  Description  TF-CBT is a treatment model that incorporates various trauma-sensitive intervention components. It aims at individualizing TF-CBT techniques to children and their circumstances while maintaining therapeutic relationship with both the child and parent. TF- CBT treatment can be used with children and adolescents who have experienced traumatic life events. It is a short-term treatment (typically 12-16 sessions) that combines trauma-sensitive interventions with cognitive behavioral therapy strategies. It can also be used as part of a larger treatment plan for children with other difficulties. TF-CBT includes individual sessions for both the child and the parents, as well as parent-child joint sessions. = Major treatment components = Major components of TF-CBT include psycho-education about childhood trauma and individualizing relaxation skills. The therapeutic elements of TF-CBT are denoted by the ‚ÄúPRACTICE‚Äù acronym. *Psychoeducation and Parenting skills *Relaxation *Affective Expression and Regulation *Cognitive Coping *Trauma Narrative Development and Processing *In Vivo Gradual Exposure *Conjoint Parent-Child sessions *Enhancing Safety and Future Development = Child-specific sessions = During the child therapy sessions, the therapist focuses on relaxation training such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation skills, emotion regulation (identifying feelings), a trauma narrative and processing (discussing the overwhelming events and associated feelings), as well as cognitive coping strategies (identifying and replacing negative thoughts). = Parent-specific sessions = Parents or primary caregivers are considered as the central therapeutic agents for improvement in TF-CBT. During the parent sessions, the therapist discusses the appropriateness of the treatment and safety plans with the parents and encourages positive parenting skills to maximize effective parenting. = Parent-child conjoint sessions = During the conjoint sessions, the therapist shares the trauma narratives and challenges to incorrect/negative thoughts as a means to encourage and facilitate parent-child communication. The therapist would only intervene when inaccurate cognitions were not addressed. = Group sessions = Group TF-CBT is an alternative to individual TF-CBT that reduces individual therapist hours and provides relief after disasters or in areas with limited resources. Similar to individual TF-CBT, group TF-CBT involves both child and caregiver and utilizes the ‚ÄòPRACTICE‚Äô elements, typically delivered through 12 structured sessions that target the reduction of distress and feelings of shame.  Evaluation of effectiveness  Randomized clinical trials examining the efficacy of TF-CBT have found it to be an effective treatment plan for a variety of disorders in both children and adolescents. TF-CBT has been proven to effectively reduce symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, externalizing behaviors, sexualized behaviors, and feelings of shame in traumatized children. TF-CBT has been shown to improve positive parenting skills and support of the child through the enhancement of parent-child communication. A study examining the combinatorial effect of TF-CBT with sertraline has found that there were only minimal benefits associated with adding sertraline to the treatment, providing evidence for an initial trial of TF-CBT before medication. While TF-CBT has been shown to just as effective as Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) for the treatment of chronic post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults, the results were tentative given low numbers in the studies, high drop out rates, and high risk of experimenter bias.Bisson J, Roberts NP, Andrew M, Cooper R, Lewis C (2013). \\"Psychological therapies for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults\\". Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 12 (12): CD003388. doi:10.1002/14651858.CD003388.pub4.  Methods of access  = Therapist = TF-CBT can be delivered by a variety of mental health professionals ranging from clinical social workers, counselors to psychologists and psychiatrists. Qualified therapists are required to be rostered or nationally certified in TF-CBT. Part of the training for this treatment includes an online TF-CBT certified training course. Additional criteria are required in order for a clinician to be rostered or nationally certified. = Implementation and adaptations = Since its development in the 1980s, TF-CBT has been used by therapists in many countries such as Australia, Cambodia, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Sweden, United States, and Zambia. It has also been used with children in the foster care system, with those who have suffered from traumatic life events, including the 9-11 terrorist attacks, and those who experienced Hurricane Katrina. TF-CBT has also been adapted to different cultures, including Latino populations. The treatment manual book has been translated into a variety of languages, such as Dutch, German, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin.

Downey was born and raised in Laramie, Wyoming, where she received her degree in Greek and Latin from the University of Wyoming. Throughout her life Downey wrote seven books and over seventy articles. Included in this work, Downey developed the Individual Will-Temperament Test, which was one of the first tests to evaluate character traits separately from intellectual capacity and the first to use psychographic methods for interpretation.\\"June Etta Downey (1875‚Äì1932)\\". Society for the Psychology of Women. In addition to her many published works, Downey held several prestigious positions. She chaired the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Wyoming and in doing so became the first woman to hold a head position at a state university. She was appointed to the American Psychological Association Council and became a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Biography =Early life= June Downey was born in Laramie, Wyoming to Stephen Wheeler Downey and Evangeline (Owen) Downey as the second child in a family of nine. Her father was a colonel in the Union Army and one of the founders of the University of Wyoming and her younger brother, Sheridan Downey, served as US Senator from California between 1938 and 1950. Following education in Laramie public schools and the University of Wyoming preparatory school she entered the university to major in Greek and Latin. =Career= After graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1895, Downey taught in an elementary school for a year before attending the University of Chicago to work in philosophy and psychology where she completed her master's degree in 1898. In 1901, Downey gained interest in experimental psychology, while attending a summer course taught by Edward Bradford Titchener at Cornell University. Returning to the University of Wyoming, Downey taught English and psychology whilst also conducting some laboratory work for a few years, under the supervision of James Rowland Angell. Downey continued her education of experimental psychology under Edward B. Titchener at Cornell University. She returned to the University of Wyoming in 1905, as a Professor of Philosophy. In 1906 she took leave from her work in order to complete her doctorate; submitting her thesis in 1908, titled 'Control Processes in Modified Handwriting', on the topic of handwriting as a measure of personality. Following her graduate work, Downey was made head of her department; the first woman to be given such a position in a state university. She published a number of academic papers as well as writing and occasionally publishing short stories, poems, plays, and popular articles, including a volume of poetry titled The Heavenly Dykes. Downey's studies focused on themes of imagery and aesthetics and were concentrated in experimental studies rather than theory. She was one of the first psychologists to study personality scientifically and became an expert in handwriting and handedness. =Later life= As Downey grew older she concentrated on her teaching. She published her last book, 'Creative Imagination', in 1929 tying together her interests in psychology and the arts. Downey gained membership to the council of the American Psychological Association between 1923 and 1925 and was one of the first two women admitted to membership in the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1929, along with Margaret Washburn. Downey never married and had no children. Downey died at her sister's home in Trenton, New Jersey in 1932 after being taken ill with stomach cancer. Shortly after her death, Downey's family presented her private library to the University of Wyoming. The University held a memorial service for her and in 1999 she was named a finalist of 'Wyoming Citizen of the Century'. James Rowland Angell, whom Downey worked under for her doctorate, described her as \\"endowed with an unusually alert and discerning mind and with a maturity of judgment extremely infrequent in students of her age.\\"  Major contributions  Downey primarily did research on handwriting, but included some research on motor processes such as involuntary muscle movement and its connection to the mind and personality. Downey had studied the practice of muscle reading from a psychological perspective.Roeckelein, Jon E. (2004). Imagery in Psychology: A Reference Guide. Praeger. p. 238. In 1919, Downey developed the Downey Individual Will-Temperament Test. This test was one of her biggest contributions to personality psychology and was one of the first personality inventories. The test measured personality based on handwriting. It contained 10 smaller tests that when combined could be calculated into a total score that represented one's \\"will-capacity\\". The Downey Individual Will-Temperament Test was arranged to represent three personality types. The three personality types are hairtrigger, which is impulsive and quick, the witful type, succinct and decisive, and the accurate type, which is slow and thoughtful. = Other interests = Similar to William James and other eminent psychologists, Downey was greatly interested in the creative arts. She wrote poems, plays, and stories throughout her life. She even wrote the school song, \\"Alma Mater\\", for the University of Wyoming. In 1911, she published The Imaginal Reaction to Poetry, one of her most important experiments involving the arts. This study examined the images people had in response to reading poetry, she believed that variation in such images revealed differences in character.  Major publications  * A Musical Experiment was published in the American Journal of Psychology * Her next work was her dissertation titled Control Process in Modified Handwriting: An Experimental Study. In this article she studied the relationship between handwriting and temperament or personality. * Heavenly Dykes published in 1904 * Imaginal Reaction to Poetry published in 1911 * Graphology and the Psychology of Handwriting published in 1919 * Plots and Personalities published in 1922 Publisher The Century Company described this book as \\"the queerest book they have ever published.\\" * The Will-temperament and its Testing published in 1923 * The Kingdom of the Mind published in 1927 * Creative Imagination: Studies in the psychology of literature published in 1929.

Downey Seminar Room, and support women in the Department of Psychology at the University of Wyoming. She is also honored by the University of Wyoming, which is home to a bronze plaque with her name on it, the use of \\"Alma Mater\\" a song written by her, and has a building named after her.

He was a deputy from 1828 to 1834, Minister of Public Education from 1828 to 1829, and a Representative in 1849. Early years Antoine Fran√ßois Henri Lefebvre de Vatimesnil was born in Rouen, Seine-Inf√©rieure, on 19 December 1789. His father was Pierre Henri Lefebvre de Vatimesnil, a deputy from 1820 to 1827. Antoine Lefebvre was admitted to the bar in 1810. He was named auditor counselor to the court of Paris in 1812, deputy prosecutor at the court of the Seine in 1815, assistant procurer general at the court of Paris in 1817, and first assistant procurer general at the court of peers on 22 February 1821. In these functions he was involved in several political trials, notably that against B√©ranger, which made him noticed. In 1822 Pierre-Denis, Comte de Peyronnet, appointed Vatimesnil Secretary General to the Ministry of Justice. He was a Councilor of State and Advocate General at the Court of Cassation in 1824. He was elected to represent Corsica on 3 January 1828, but his election was cancelled since he was not old enough to serve as a deputy. Minister of Education On 1 February 1828 Vatimesnil was named by royal decree Minister of State and Minister of Education in the Ministry of Jean-Baptiste de Martignac, despite not being a member of either House due to his age. His appointment caused protests, and he was accused of being \\"affiliated with the congregations and imbued with their mysterious doctrines\\". To the surprise of his critics, his first circular recommended freedom of conscience, and development of primary education. He made important changes in his department, introducing the study of modern languages in schools and improving the pay of teachers. His main concern was the conditions of primary teachers, who offered him a medal when he retired in 1829. Vatimesnil also reorganized the √âcole Normale, created a chair of international law at the Faculty of Law of Paris, restored the chair of administrative Law and approved the foundation of the √âcole Centrale. He spoke in the Chambers in defense of the ordinances of 16 June 1828 which submitted the ecclesiastical educational establishments to the university system. He left power when the cabinet fell in August 1829 and returned to the practice of law. Later career Vatimesnil was elected deputy for Cantal (Saint-Flour) and for Nord (Valenciennes) on 23 June 1830. He chose to represent Valenciennes. After the July Revolution of 1830 he voted with the House in favor of the lieutenant-general of the kingdom handing over to the Duke of Orleans. He was rapporteur of the new electoral law. Vatimesnil was reelected for Valenciennes on 5 July 1831. He spoke against divorce and was rapporteur of the budget of the judiciary. He did not stand for election in 1834. Vatimesnil returned to his career as an advocate. He became counsel for many religious congregations, and was vice-president of the electoral committee of religious freedom in 1843. He twice refused the peerage, which was offered to him through Villemain and Montalembert. After the February Revolution of 1848, on 13 May 1849 he was elected as Representative of Eure in the Legislature. He was one of the leaders of the monarchist majority. He protested after the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851, and was detained for a few days at Fort Mont-Val√©rien before returning to private life.

She was the Chief Executive Officer of Refugee Women in Development (RefWID), Inc., a global non-profit organization that advocated for the civil rights of refugee women and girls fleeing from conflict and for their equitable reintegration into their societies. She was also the vice president of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, the world‚Äôs first feminist think tank. Wali said that her personal experience as a refugee of the Soviet- Afghan War inspired her fight for the human rights of uprooted populations. Her testimonies throughout her career before the United Nations, the United States Congress and the U.S. State Department led to the appropriation of millions of dollars supporting Afghan women-led NGOs and the participation of women in Afghanistan's nascent democracy. She delivered the keynote address at the United Nations' celebration of International Women's Day in 2002, speaking alongside U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, First Lady Laura Bush, and Queen Noor of Jordan. She was also a speaker at the Ford Hall Forum in 1999 and 2009, and she has been a participant in the Dropping Knowledge project, among many other prestigious events and notable institutions.  Career  In 2001, Sima Wali was one of only three female delegates at the U.N.-organized Bonn Agreement in Germany, which formed a new Afghan government, following the fall of the Taliban.https://www.un.org/events/women/2002/wali.htm She served as a representative of King Mohammed Zahir Shah's Rome delegation. At the conference, Wali was pivotal in the creation of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, insisting that her male counterparts permanently include the ministry in the new administration.http://www.un.org/events/women/2002/wali.htm She was then nominated to lead that ministry, but declined in order to focus on her international activism. Wali went on to nominate Sima Samar to the position of Minister of Women's Affairs and also selected other women to serve in the interim government and ensured that gender-sensitive language was incorporated into the peace agreement. Sima Wali appears on the front page of The Guardian newspaper on December 6, 2001. That same year, Wali served as the chief organizer of the Afghan Women's Summit for Democracy in Brussels, Belgium, an unparalleled gathering of its kind. The summit was convened with the help of Equality Now, UNIFEM, the Gender Advisor to the U.N. Secretary-General, along with a coalition of women's organizations. According to Equality Now, the Afghan Women‚Äôs Summit \\"adopted an historic expression of the long held dreams and aspirations of Afghan women, together with a list of concrete demands for immediate implementation relating to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\\" In June 2003, Wali was accompanied by Women's Edge co-founder and executive director Ritu Sharma on a human rights advocacy mission to Afghanistan. It was one of several trips Wali undertook to her homeland and to Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan, where she led dozens of training and empowerment seminars. Wali often spoke out against \\"the constant marginalization\\" of females in refugee and post-war societies, calling for training that helps those women to become leaders. According to the NGO Dropping Knowledge, \\"Wali has pioneered in developing program models aimed at empowering women affected by conflict, rebuilding post-conflict democratic civil society institutions, and advocating for human rights protection of women and their male counterparts.\\" In the 1990s, Wali played a strong role in supporting the development of NGOs in Bosnia and Croatia during the war in what was then Yugoslavia. She also played a key role in creating the Policy Council on Afghan Women, a coalition of non- governmental organizations that works to advance women's status in Afghanistan and to ensure that women there are equal recipients of U.S. development assistance funds. While she was in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, in 2005 to launch a project on building democracy among women, Wali narrowly escaped death at the hands of Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and Pakistani militants. Although she had received a death threat from the Taliban before, this was the closest she had come to being killed by forces opposed to her work. Since their ascent in the mid-1990s, Wali had been a vocal opponent of the Taliban's ideology. At the State of the World Forum in 1998, she said: Sima Wali leads a training seminar for Afghan refugees at a camp in Peshawar, Pakistan, in 1998. She had also been a bold critic of what she felt was the American government's abandonment of Afghanistan between the 12 years that the Soviet-Afghan War ended and the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan began. Wali's writings have been published in prominent journals, newspapers and books. In Women in Exile, she relates some of the harrowing details of her escape from Afghanistan in 1978. Wali co- authored Invisible History: Afghanistan's Untold Story (2009) with Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould. Fitgerald and Gould, along with RefWID, also produced the documentary film The Woman in Exile Returns: The Sima Wali Story. It tells the story of Wali's return to Kabul in October 2002 after 24 years in exile and her work to help in the rebuilding efforts.The Woman in Exile Returns: The Sima Wali Story Grailwerk Wali has made speeches, led conferences and sat on panels at many universities and institutions, which include the United Nations, the United States Congress, the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International, Ford Hall Forum, Yale University Law School, George Washington University Law School, Northeastern University, Woodrow Wilson Center, the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, and the Dropping Knowledge project. She has been interviewed and featured on various news programs on CNN, CBS News, ABC News, FOX News, Al Jazeera, NPR, and CBC. Prior to her exile to the United States in 1978, Wali worked for the American Embassy in Kabul and the U.S. Peace Corps. Wali died on September 22, 2017 in Falls Church, Virginia from multiple system atrophy at the age of 66.Washington Post Sima Wali, exiled champion of Afghan women, dies at 66, October 12  Education  Sima Wali was conferred honorary doctorate degrees by both Smith College and Shenandoah University in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

The historic library opened its doors to the public on April 7, 1894 and began as a modest reading room and has remained a thriving community resource for over a hundred years.  History  = Early years = The Lemon City Branch Library at its former, 412 NE 61st Street, location. The creation of the Lemon City Library is credited to the Lemon City Library and Improvement Association which decided to establish a reading room inside the front of Cornelia Keyes' cottage, located at 701 NE 62nd Street. Keyes, who was originally from Chicago, owned the prestigious Lemon City Hotel and also taught school. On April 7, 1894, Keyes opened the doors of her modest library to the small community of 350 residents. In 1902 the Lemon City Library moved into its first, dedicated building made of wood planks, which was located at 412 NE 61st Street. This location served the patrons of the surrounding area for 62 years. = Establishing the first collection and the Lemon City Library Association = In the early days, the Lemon City Library's first collection consisted of contributions from many illustrious donators. Andrew Carnegie, who docked his yacht near Lemon City, was said to have donated a small assortment of volumes. Charles B. Cory, the curator of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, was also said to have gifted a few dozen volumes while he was in the area for one of his annual Everglades safaris. Henry Flagler, the founder of the Florida East Coast Railway, was also said to have donated generously to the cause. Similarly to many libraries of the time, a majority of the work done to develop and sustain a community library was done so by a group of local women whose goal it was to create betterment in the community. Thirteen women came together on the day the library first opened its doors, and pledged to pay ten cents in monthly dues, donate a book to the collection, and take a book home in order to stimulate the use of the library. Unlike other local communities who had the support of a woman's club which supported many local endeavors, in Lemon City, these thirteen women joined together to create the Lemon City Library Association on February 4, 1902. This association of volunteers were constantly fundraising through community socials to raise money needed to add titles and later build its first dedicated building. In the first three years, they were able to raise $683.46, the equivalent to over $18,000 today. All of this money went towards building the library, which opened its doors in 1905 with 346 titles. = Early circulation = Among the more popular books being circulated during these early years were Wonders of the World, Ben-Hur, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Ramona, Barriers Burned Away, The Five Little Peppers, and The Farmer's Almanac. = Joining the Miami-Dade Public Library and today = Lemon City Branch Library in its current location at 430 NE 61st Street. For nearly forty years, the Lemon City Library was manned by volunteers who were overseen by the Lemon City Library and Improvement Association. The library itself managed to outlive the community it was a part of when Lemon City was enveloped by surrounding neighborhoods. Today the area is known as Little Haiti. In 1942 the library became a member of the Miami-Dade Public Library System. After a fire broke out, the branch was expected to close in 1963 as the damage from the fire was too impracticable to restore. Members of the community had been advocating for the construction of a new building to house the library, and for the original to be marked as a historical landmark. The Lemon City Branch Library officially opened the doors to its current location, a 6,393 square foot building located at 430 NE 61st Street, on April 13, 1964. Today, the library boasts a 10,000 piece collection of books and materials, including databases and internet access. = Important events/dates in the establishment of the Lemon City Public Library = The exact date of the Lemon City Public Library has come into question over the last few years, due to confusion over the meaning and distinction between the words library, circulating library, and public library. According to historical records, Miss Ada Merritt arrived in Lemon City in the 1890s to serve as a school teacher and establish the first \\"school library\\" in Lemon City. As Lemon City's population continued to rise, citizens living in Lemon City began to form their own cultural engagement groups in order to bring more life to the city, and to improve life in the city as a whole. One such group was created by Ada Merritt, coined the \\"Busy Bees of the Everglades\\" this group of young women came together to raise money for the fledgling school library collection. Through the group's efforts, the collection grew over a period of several years to reach the sizable amount of 400 volumes. Between 1892 and 1893, Ada Merritt and the Busy Bees coordinated various functions, from dances to formal dinners, in an effort to raise money and continue funding and supporting the growing library. The Tropical Sun newspaper, the first newspaper published in the area, features an article dated May 6, 1893 that describes Miss Ada Merritt's school library and the delivery of new books for the collection. There is no mention of another library established in Lemon City during the early years of Ada Merritt's school library. In 1896, the Village Improvement Association (V.I.A.) came together in the home of Mrs. Cornelia Keys with the aim to improve roads going in and out of Lemon City. Before the roads were laid, residents and travelers journeying through Lemon City and beyond were forced to traverse rocky roads, mud, and swamps. Paved roads required hard labor and funds; through the V.I.A.'s efforts, fully functional, easily traversable roads started to become a reality. In 1902, Dade County took on the task of overseeing road construction in and out of Lemon City, and funded such projects through the selling of bonds, leaving the V.I.A in need of a new mission. In 1902, thirteen women came together once more in the home of Cornelia Keys; the V.I.A. was disbanded and a new group formed a library association. These thirteen women, many of whom were former members of the V.I.A., went on to become the motivating force behind the creation of the first recorded public library in Lemon City. Following the example set by the Busy Bees over a decade before the library association's formation, the group started to host fundraising events to support the library initiative. It was at this time that Cornelia Keys' residence began to serve as the base for the town's library. For the next three years, until 1905, the thirteen members of the library association agreed to pay monthly member dues, donate books, and take books home, much like a traditional circulating library at the time. The Lemon City Library plaque commemorating the location of the original library. The site is currently adjacent to the where the current library is located. During this time, the library association's valiant effort served to grow the number of monetary contributions received through fundraising events, as well as the available number of furnishings and books for the collection itself. Construction of the library began in 1904 and found a home at 412 N.E. 61st Street in Lemon City. The formal dedication ceremony for Lemon's City Public Library took place on January 13, 1905. The library served Lemon City residents for several decades, and became part of the Miami-Dade Public Library System in 1942. In 1963, the library was scheduled to close and after a fire caused severe damage to the structure; it was decided that a new Lemon City Public Library would be built. On April 13, 1964, the newly built Lemon City Public Library officially opened and has remained open at its current location ever since.

He was also a keen sportsman, botanist, fisherman and collected curios. He wrote several books, and some of his collection passed to the Mansfield Museum. Personal life Whitaker was born at Ramsdale Farm, Arnold near Nottingham on 12 July 1850, the oldest son of another Joseph Whitaker. He received his education at Uppingham School, and loved the outdoors, a trait he learned from his father. For most of his life he lived at Rainworth Lodge, on Blidworth Lane at Rainworth. He married Mary Edison at Blidworth church on 16 April 1872, and they had five children. The first, Ethel Mary, died in infancy, while the fifth, Vera, married Sir Harold Bowden, 2nd Baronet, in 1908, but the marriage was short lived and they divorced in 1919. Among Whitaker's unusual traits was his habit of always walking on the road, and never on the pavement. He died on 27 May 1932 at Rainworth Lodge. The Joseph Whitaker School in Rainworth was named after him. Professional life The replacement Bird Stone in Thieves Wood Whitaker was a naturalist, and his home at Rainworth Lodge looked more like a museum, as it was full of cases of stuffed birds and other exhibits of natural life. One was an Egyptian nightjar, at the time the first known sighting of one in Britain, and only the second in Europe. It had been shot by a gamekeeper called Albert Spinks on 23 June 1883. Spinks knew of Whitaker's interest in birds, and having mentioned it, Whitaker retrieved the bird and had it stuffed. He erected a 'Bird Stone' to commemorate the event in Thieves Wood, to the west of Rainworth, but this was vandalised in the 1980s, and was replaced by a modern artifice. The nightjar, together with many other exhibits, was given to Mansfield Museum on his death. He became an authority on many kinds of wildlife, and especially British birds, although he was not averse to shooting them. On 10 October 1906 he and six others held a shooting party, which gained the record for the biggest bag in Nottinghamshire. The game killed that day included 1,504 partridges. Whitaker was a keen botanist, fisherman and sportsman, and collected curios. He collected deer horns, aided by the fact that he had his own deer park, which he populated with Japanese deer. This was situated immediately to the south of his house, and is shown on the 1900 Ordnance Survey map, but not on the map from 1891.Ordnance Survey 1:10,560 map, 1891 and 1900 (available here ) In his own description of the park, Whitaker stated that it covered and contained 21 fallow deer. Also in the enclosure were ten four-horned St Kilda sheep, three emus and two rheas. As well as serving as a Justice of the Peace, he became a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and vice-president of the Selborne Society. He also commissioned a window in Selborne church as a memorial to Revd. Gilbert White, a pioneer of birdwatching. The window has three lights, showing St Francis and a number of birds, all of which are mentioned in White's book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. Whitaker wrote a number of books, including at least one volume of poems, and made contributions to the Victoria County History series of books. His collection included china, bric-a-brac, books and prints, and among the curios he amassed was possibly the first known circular saw, which was manufactured at the Barringer, Manners and Wallis factory in Rock Valley, Mansfield.

He instead found work at the age of 15 as an office boy at MGM and thereafter as a make-up artist in film and television. Because of his stocky build, he also landed acting work in the 1940s, mostly uncredited, minor parts, or as henchmen in westerns or drama films.

Vilenska had emerged in the spring of 1972 as a leading voice against the Maki leadership, accusing it of 'right-wing deviations'. Vilenska and her followers argued that the alliance should include more radical forces, such as Uri Avnery's Meri. When Meri was not included in the alliance, Vilenska's group participated in the Meri list in the 1973 Knesset election.

Aki had a predominately Jewish membership. The group opposed both Maki and Rakah.

However, in Christchurch, New Zealand, he worked as a bureaucrat, politician and businessman. He was one of the Canterbury Pilgrims, having arrived in Lyttelton, on , one of the First Four Ships. He was a business partner of Edward Cephas John Stevens and senior partner of Harman and Stevens, and together they took financial control of the Christchurch newspaper The Press from its original proprietor, James FitzGerald, over a protracted period. Harman held many important roles with the Canterbury Provincial Council and was the last Deputy-Superintendent. Early life Harman was born in Dublin in 1826, the son of Richard Harman. He was educated at Rugby School under Dr Thomas Arnold, and at King's College London. He was a pupil of George and Sir John Rennie, the London engineers, and he graduated as a civil engineer. Professional life Soon afterwards, he emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in Lyttelton on 17 December 1850 by the ship Sir George Seymour. He lived in Canterbury except for one period. Between 1854‚Äì56, he was emigration agent in London for the Canterbury Province. With the financial assistance of long-standing friends of Canterbury, John Robert Godley and Henry Selfe Selfe, he established emigration to the province. The first ship which he sent out was the Grasmere in 1855. The sixth, and last, which brought him back to Lyttelton, in 1856, was the Egmont. Harman had already established himself in business in 1851 as a land and estate agent, and as agent for absentee land owners. He was joined in that business in 1862 by the Hon. Edward Cephas John Stevens. Harman was one of the original land purchasers in Christchurch. In February 1851, he took up rural section (RS) 58, which had an area of ; rural sections were numbered in the order in which they were assigned to land holders. Harman and the surveyor Cyrus Davie took up land between Lake Ellesmere and the Selwyn River. In May 1853, they purchased Run 82, and in the following month, they bought the adjoining Run 53 from James Stuart-Wortley. In 1862, they took up Run 426, which gave them access to the lake. Much of the land was freeholded by them, and Harman sold his holding in the late 1870s. =The Press= Press Building in Cashel Street, in use by the newspaper until 1908. Harman and Stevens took over the land from James FitzGerald in 1872 Harman was part of the committee that decided on the establishment of The Press, a newspaper first published on 25 May 1861. The intellectual brain of this venture was James FitzGerald, who had been the first editor of the Lyttelton Times. Fitzgerald, who had retired from the Lyttelton Times in 1853, was opposed to the proposed tunnel project for reasons of fiscal irresponsibility, but his old newspaper was one of the project's chief supporters. The Lyttelton Times' editor, Crosbie Ward, made an imputation of unknown content, and this spurred FitzGerald to set up The Press as a rival newspaper. In February 1862, an attempt was made to form a company and formalise the ownership of the paper. A deed of association for \\"The Proprietors of The Press\\" was drafted, and it lists the five members of the previous committee (John Charles Watts-Russell, Rev. John Raven, H. P. Lance, Henry Tancred, and Harman), plus five new members: Alfred Richard Creyke, John Hall, Joseph Brittan, Isaac Cookson, and James Somerville Turnbull. Surprisingly, the deed was not executed, but four month later, FitzGerald, who had no funds, was the sole owner \\"through the liberality of the proprietors\\", as he called it later. In June , Fitzgerald won a by-election and regained a seat in the House of Representatives. With less time for the day-to-day affairs of The Press, Fitzgerald engaged Harman and Stevens later in 1863 as commercial agents to run the newspaper's affairs. Stevens was mostly acting on behalf of the commercial agents. Over a protracted period of several years, Harman and Stevens manoeuvred Fitzgerald out of ownership by taking on his debts, charging large interest on loans, and taking more and more control. Harman and Stevens took over most of Fitzgerald's shareholding in 1871, and in June 1872, they bought the business premises in Cashel Street from him. Fitzgerald kept a mortgaged shareholding, but had lost control to Harman and Stevens. In its centennial history, the period of high debt and poor financial management under Fitzgerald is described \\"as a discolouration of the brightest character connected with The Press in its founding years.\\" The writers of the history acknowledge Harman and Stevens as \\"among the shrewdest financial brains in Christchurch in their day\\". FitzGerald once called Stevens a \\"thorough Jew\\". Public service =Political activity= Harman was elected onto the council of the Society of Land Purchasers, the organisation that looked after the interests of the settlers and dealt with the representative of the Canterbury Association, John Robert Godley. Harman was clerk of the council. Harman was member of the Canterbury Provincial Council for different constituencies. He was first elected for the Heathcote electorate in November 1857 in the election for the second council. He resigned in January 1858 and was re-elected in the following month, and served until January 1860. From February 1860 to January 1861, he represented the Akaroa electorate, and was again Akaroa's representative from September 1861 to March 1862. Prior to his first election onto the council, he was appointed in June 1857 onto the Canterbury Executive Council led by Richard Packer. He was on successive executive councils under Charles Bowen, Thomas Cass, and resigned in January 1858 when the executive was led by Henry Tancred. He held the roles of Provincial Treasurer and Auditor while on the executive. He then led the Executive Council himself for a week in November 1859. Harman was the province's last Deputy-Superintendent and filled that role from September 1871 until the abolition of provincial government in 1876. The second Canterbury Superintendent, William Sefton Moorhouse, shocked the province into economic development by putting a tunnel through the Port Hills and developing a railway system. In 1861, he planned a spur line from the Heathcote River port at Ferrymead to the main line to Christchurch and arranged privately to purchase land from Captain William Charlesworth. Finding that he lacked the money, Moorhouse obtained permission from his executive to take funds from the provincial account. Harman, acting treasurer and outside the executive, resigned rather than approve this cavalier means of obtaining money. Moorhouse's foes on the provincial council, led by Joseph Brittan, were strident in their criticism of the 'Branch Railway Job' and tried, unsuccessfully, to drive him from office. =Community engagement= Harman has served on many public bodies, including the Christchurch Drainage Board and Domain Board, and was at one time chairman. Harman was a member of the Cathedral Chapter and Diocesan Synod. He was for thirty years a member of the governing body of Christ's College, and from 1876 to 1878 of the Canterbury College. As a volunteer in the early days, he was captain of No. 2 Company Christchurch Rifles, and was also for many years captain of the Honorary Reserve Corps. Sometimes business and community engagement overlapped. For many years, Harman and Stevens were the agents for English businessman, Benjamin Lancaster, who, in 1850, had bought Rural Section 62, on Ferry Road, just outside the original boundary of the City of Christchurch. In 1880, Christchurch sportsmen sought land which they could enclose and where the public would pay to witness cricket, cycling and rugby. Lancaster agreed to sell, for two thousand eight hundred and forty one pounds, 10 acres three roods and 30 perches. The purchaser was the newly formed Canterbury Cricket and Athletics Sports Club. On the site, there was established the famed Lancaster Park. E. C. J. Stevens, a prominent member of the club, is commemorated in a thoroughfare in the area, Stevens Street. Harman had a strong affinity to the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Christchurch's first Anglican church and the settlements pro-cathedral until the completion of ChristChurch Cathedral in 1881. Harman attended service every Sunday, was a churchwarden and a vestryman. When a new vestry was built in 1901, he had a bad fall on the construction site and broke his thigh bone, which made him bed bound for three months. Death It is assumed that Harman never fully recovered from his accident at St Michael, and he died on 26 November 1902 at his residence in Windmill Road. His funeral service was held at St Michael, and he was buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery.

It is the 65th episode overall. The episode features a guest appearance by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc. Plot Sheldon attempts to work out when he is going to die, and he estimates that he has 60 years to live at most. He concludes that he will miss \\"the singularity\\", a point in time in which technology will be advanced enough for him to transfer his brain into a machine and live forever. Based on this, he alters his diet, replacing pizza with cruciferous vegetables on Thursdays, beginning with brussel sprouts. He also makes the decision to start exercising, and after Raj points out that Penny jogs, the two decide to go jogging together. At nighttime, Sheldon knocks on Leonard's bedroom in distress, claiming to have cholera. When Leonard dismisses this, he suggests some equally unlikely alternatives, while Leonard thinks he may have appendicitis. Before they can go to the hospital, Sheldon farts loudly. Sheldon suggests that this was a result of the brussel sprouts he had and the two return to bed. Sheldon meets up with Penny to go jogging and she attempts to get him to warm up. After he fails to touch his toes, she says they can warm up on the run. Sheldon jogs down the stairs and falls. When Penny tries to help him up, he farts again causing Sheldon to give up eating cruciferous vegetables. As a result of his failed attempts to have a healthier lifestyle, Sheldon creates a \\"mobile virtual presence device\\": a robot which will replace him, performing his normal tasks while controlled by Sheldon from his bedroom. (The telepresence robot is a reference to Willow Garage.) Leonard tries to convince him that the robot is crazy, but Sheldon refuses to listen to him as he believes it will increase his lifespan. Sheldon then cites Section 74C of the Roommate Agreement, which requires Leonard to assist him in the event that he becomes a robot. Leonard is irritated by the robot when driving to work. Although Sheldon attempts to relax him by playing music and suggesting games, when Leonard switches him off, he turns back on again shouting \\"Bazinga!\\" Leonard, taken by surprise, nearly crashes and is furious that he \\"almost died\\", while Sheldon is home \\"...safe and sound in bed\\". Sheldon asks Leonard \\"Who's crazy now?\\". At the Cheesecake Factory, the gang spot Steve Wozniak and Sheldon converses with him through the robot. Sheldon says he has a 1977 Apple II, and Wozniak says that he would sign it if he had it there. Sheldon rushes to meet him but trips and falls down the stairs again, breaking the Apple II.

It is located south of Ulster Park on route 9W. Esopus is within the Kingston metro area. The name Esopus comes from the name of the Native American tribe who lived in the area. History It was in 1609 when English sailor sailing for the Dutch Henry Hudson sailed up the Hudson River up to Albany. In 1651, what is now the City of Kingston was settled. From September, 1659 to September, 1663; a series of conflicts, known as the Esopus Wars, were fought between the Dutch and the Esopus tribe. During that time, the tribe sold large tracts of land to French Huguenot refugees in New Paltz. Now, descendants of the Esopus live in Shawano County, Wisconsin. In 1811, the Town of Esopus was established after \\"separating\\" from Kingston. In 1838, Robert Livingston Pell moved into the area and established a farm just north of Esopus. He was one of the first farmers to grow apples and export them to Europe. Also on his farm, they had orchards, vineyards, and ten artificial lakes used for breeding fish. In 1904, Redemptorist Fathers began building the House of Studies. In June of that same year, they purchased 235 acres from the Robert Livingston Pell estate. In 1907, the large, 444 foot long stone building was finished. It had 220 rooms. For 115 years, Mount St. Alphonsus was in the hands of the Fathers of Ulster County. On January 1, 2012, the Mount was sold to the people of Woodcrest (who live in nearby Rifton) for $40 million. In 2011, the entire Town of Esopus celebrated 200 years since establishment. Geography Esopus is located on the west bank of the Hudson River between Kingston and Poughkeepsie. To the north of the hamlet is Ulster Park, to the west are the Marlboro Mountains with the Shaupeneak Ridge Cooperative Recreation Area, and to the south is the hamlet of West Park. Esopus is a basic hamlet and only has 5 streets: 9W runs north-south through the hamlet, Main Street, which used to be the original Broadway/9W until a new section of 9W was built splitting off from Main Street, later to meet again about 1/2 mile down the road, Black Creek Road, Parker Avenue, which connects 9W to Main Street, and Old Post Road, which heads west from Esopus across the Marlboro Mountains.

In about 1852, he married Sarah Ann Lore. They had five children, two of whom died before the age of five. In 1864, they purchased the 21/100 acre plot in Mauricetown to build their house. Peterson was financially successful, and was known to travel to ports throughout the Atlantic and the Caribbean. His 1878 ship the Harry B.

Several owners in the twentieth century carried on the tradition of working with maritime trades. Peterson's son, who owned the house with his wife from 1895 until his death in 1900, made his living through maritime work, and census records show that the next two owners, a father and son, were respectively a mariner and producer in the oyster industry.1920 and 1930 United States Censuses, Mauricetown, Commercial Township, Cumberland County, New Jersey.

Georg Albert Schieferdecker (1815-1891) became pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in 1850 following the death of Pastor Loeber.Mississippi Valley Architecture-Altenburg The beginning of the dispute arose in the spring of 1856 when the Western District of the LCMS held its sessions in Altenburg. After two days of discussion concerning questions over the future and universal conversion of Israel and the so-called thousand-year reign‚Äîa dispute surrounding the interpretation of Revelation 20‚Äîthe district passed resolutions rejecting and condemning all forms of chiliasm. Two members of the district along with a deputy declared they were not in agreement with these resolutions. One of these members was Pastor Gruber, who was the oldest minister of the synod at that time; the other was Schieferdecker, who was also the district president. The incident affected the congregation in Altenburg, which then numbered almost 100 members. Shortly after the resolution had been passed, parties rose up for and against the verdict. Pastor R√∂bbelen was against chiliasm and his declarations found approval with many members of the Altenburg congregation. Over the next year the debate led to division within the congregation. At the convention of the LCMS in 1857 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, charges of heresy were levied against Schieferdecker. The charges led to even deeper division and the subsequent resignation of Schieferdecker. The synod declared that any member of the congregation who did not agree with the resolutions of the Synod was forthwith expelled from the Synod and the congregation, and were deemed followers of a heretic. Approximately one-third of the members ignored the synodical decision and followed their former pastor out of the church.http://www.archivaria.com pg. 6 http://www.archivaria.com/Altenburg/Altenburg6.html =New congregation= The next day, on November 2, 1857, a new church was incorporated under the name \\"Immanuel Congregation\\". The congregation joined the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa, which later merged into the American Lutheran Church.cyclopedia.lcsm.org http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=S&word;=SCHIEFERDECKER.GEORGALBERT At first, church services were held in people's houses, but construction of a blockhouse to serve as a temporary church was begun. It was dedicated seven weeks later at the first service celebrating Christmas. Work was begun in early 1858 on a larger stone church, which was dedicated on the Second Sunday of Advent, 1858. The schism that led to the division and creation of a new congregation in Altenburg was also felt in New Wells, Missouri. There, the congregation also separated into two opposing groups.http://www.archivaria.com pg. 18 http://www.archivaria.com/Altenburg/Altenburg18.html Immanuel rejoined the LCMS in 1988.

Ballantyne. At the age of 16, he traveled to Canada, where he spent five years working for the Hudson's Bay Company, trading with the Native Americans for furs. His Canadian experiences formed the basis for his first novel, The Young Fur Traders, published in 1856, the year he decided to become a full-time writer and embarked on the adventure stories for the young with which his name is popularly associated. His most popular novel was The Coral Island, published in 1858. Plot summary The Eagle Cliff is a third-person tale that begins with the hero, a cyclist soon identified as John Barrett, who is racing through the streets of London to respond to a telegram from an old schoolmate, Bob Mabberly. The unconventional hero has a literally bumpy start to his journey as he accidentally runs into a little old lady. Though she appears to be alright, Barret's fear of being arrested causes him to flee. However, because he is the hero, he cannot shake the guilty conscience and returns to the site of the accident, only to find that the old lady and the crowd that gathered to be gone. Wrought with worry, Barret makes his way to Mabberly. Mabberly has engaged a yacht and crew and intends to \\"sail, without fail\\" the next morning with Barrett and another schoolmate, Giles Jackman. The next day, not long at sea, misfortune befalls the party and they collide with a passing steamer, causing their vessel to split down the middle. Now in the water, the men make their way toward the rocky shore of a now-visible island. Upon arrival, the men elect Barrett to search for habitation. He comes across a sheep track, a primitive road and eventually a hut among the rocks. From here, Barrett begins to meet the people who reside on the island, all of whom are white. When the rest of the party joins Barrett, they are happy to learn the houses there are fully functioning (with kitchens and bedrooms, each stocked appropriately). As fate would have it, Barrett happens upon a young girl, Milly, lying on the road, who has injured her arm after falling from a cliff. Barret eventually develops feelings for her. He and Milly share a love for botany, which was the cause of her fall from the cliff, and use this area of interest to pave the way for further interaction. Elsewhere, the men engage in hunting outings as well as occasionally fishing (or in Archie's case, photography). Meanwhile, Milly has been writing home, telling her mother about the man who saved her life, effectively causing her mother to become fond of him. When news of Mrs. Moss' arrival reaches Barrett, he rushes to meet her, only to nearly knock her over. She turns out to be the very same woman Barrett had hit with his bicycle earlier on. At this point, though she recognizes him as the man who ran her down, she does not know he is Barret. After falling from a cliff and falling unconscious, Barrett does not show up for supper, worrying the others and causing them to search for him. Once found, he is unrecognizable due to the bruising and head-dressings he now bears, successfully continuing to hide his identity from Mrs. Moss. Once he has healed and she discovers that he is indeed Barrett, she agrees to forgive him, thus allowing Milly and him to marry.  Prominent Characters  * John Barrett A young man, with a literal run-in with fate, who crashes on an island and discovers that it is already inhabited by civilized families. It is on first day that he finds a girl lying unconscious on a road who turns out to later be his love interest. Together they share a love for botany and art, which Barrett spends most of his time doing, as opposed to hunting and fishing like his male counterparts. * Milly Moss A woman who lives on the island and is found by John Barrett. She quickly becomes his infatuation and eventually his bride. Her interest in botany serves as an entry for Barrett and her to flirt. * Bob Mabberly An old schoolmate of John Barrett's who invites him to sea with him and joins him on the island. * Giles Jackman Also an old schoolmate of John Barrett and Bob Mabberly. He pulls the group together to recount a tale of hunting elephants. He leads a church service in the absence of the minister. * Junkie A young boy who lives on the island and attempts to follow in the footsteps of the grown men around him. * Ivor Donaldson The alcoholic on the island who has a tendency to become violent whilst drunk. He eventually finds God and stops drinking.  Writing Style & Genre  The Eagle Cliff is told through an editorial voice that occasionally converses with the reader. The story is advanced through use of dialogue primarily, but also through detailed descriptions of environment. The descriptions of the environment and their large presence in the text can most likely be attributed to Ballantyne's admitted blunder in The Coral Island regarding the coconut shell thickness and how this mistake encouraged him to visit the scenes in which his stories were told for authenticity. This made him one of the first writers of fictional adventure stories to carry out background research to make his stories more realistic. Through his dedication to realistically depicting the environments that he wrote about, Ballantyne takes part in the literary movement called Naturalism and is thus considered a Naturalist. His novels illustrate environments as close to reality as possible. Josh Rahn of Morehead State University states: ‚ÄúNaturalism displayed some very specific characteristics that delimit it from the contemporary literature that was merely realistic. The environment, especially the social environment, played a large part in how the narrative developed. The locale essentially becomes its own character, guiding the human characters in ways they do not fully realize. Plot structure as such was secondary to the inner workings of character, which superficially resembles how the Realists approached characterization Naturalist texts typically include darker, more grim situations, often depicting characters of lower class standing or people powerless against a much stronger force. This happens to a degree in the Eagle Cliff as the main characters end up shipwrecked on an unfamiliar island and lose all of their belongings. However, after some exploration, they find a population of civilized people living in relatively amicable homes. The novel is reminiscent of the Robinsonade genre as they share common themes and conventions, but does not commit to them fully. As mentioned, The main characters are well off financially and while their shipwreck causes them to lose their resources, they quickly regain similar luxuries on the island because the people already inhabiting it possess them. Their safety is therefore only somewhat threatened before landing on the seemingly deserted island. In typical Robinsonade novels, the protagonist is abruptly isolated from civilization, oftentimes due to a shipwreck in which he/she is marooned on a secluded and uninhabited island. He must improvise the means of his survival from the limited resources at hand. Unlike many adventure novels, The Eagle Cliff seems to avoid the presence of dark-skinned \\"savages\\". Instead, it focuses more on the miniature Britain that is built on the island and how the characters interact with it as well as one another. In fact, a group decides to attend church services and proceeds to take a short boat ride to it. It is here where Ballantyne's inclusion of religion is most noticeable. Historical Content After the events in the Congo, portrayed in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, there was a decline in imperialistic attitude amongst the British population. This could indicate why there is a lack of \\"others\\" within The Eagle Cliff. Themes = Masculinity = The novel makes a point to focus on the masculine activities that each male on the island (whether they be inhabitants or visitors) is familiar with. The people already inhabiting the island have no shortage of guns, fishing equipment or desire to put these items to use, and frequently do. In fact, the novel is centered largely around these activities and the homo-social relationships they cultivate through participating. = Fate & Romance = Though it is subtle amongst the instances of hunting, fishing and other activities, this novel can be read as one about romance. From the book's beginning, Ballantyne plays with the idea of fate. Just the reader meets John Barrett, he has a collision with a little old lady. His decision to flee (despite turning around to correct his injustice) effects his journey from that point on. As the book continues, it is discovered that Barrett's Intended is the daughter of the very woman he ran down earlier, providing obstacles for the budding couple. This aligns with common characteristics in naturalist texts because that particular movement deals with determinism. Determinism is the idea that a character has a direct control on the course of his/her life is superseded by a concentration on nature of fate. Another common characteristic of naturalist texts is a shocking twist at the end of the story. We see this in The Eagle Cliff when John Barrett runs into a woman on the island, the very woman he ran down at the beginning of the story, and she turns out to be his intended's mother. = Christianity = Woven through the plot, there are countless mentions of religion, which serves as a moral guideline for the characters. Following suit with many of his other juvenile novels, Ballantyne includes a theme of Christianity. John Rennie Short claims that Ballantyne's piety and writing style were quite attractive leading to his enormous popularity: \\"[his] books were aimed at the songs of the Victorian middle class. Imbued with deep religious conviction, he felt he had a moral purpose of educating such boys into codes of honor, decency, and religiosity. The high moral tone was redeemed by Ballantyne's ability to tell a cracking good yarn in an accessible and well-fashioned prose style.\\" = Natives and imperialism = Unlike the typical nature of adventure novel, The Eagle Cliff is mostly devoid of native encounters. When the main characters arrive at the island, rather than being met by dark-skinned natives, they are met by hospitable and civilized white British settlers. The only mention of non-white people comes from a story regarding elephant hunting told by Giles Jackman. \\"Great men from all parts of the country assembled at this hunt, some of them bringing troops of tame elephants and followers with them. There were governors and rajahs, and private secretaries, with some of their wives, military officers, forest officers, commissioners, collectors, superintendents, magistrates, surgeons, medical officers, and even clergymen, besides a host of smaller fry and servants. It was a regular army!\\" Despite the absence of island natives, the novel is not without imperialistic undertones. Following a popular adventure fiction trope, the presence of an island coupled with a shipwreck to said island is include, however, there is not much said in the way of politics or military. Critical reception Unfortunately there is very little scholarly concentration on The Eagle Cliff in particular, other than a brief book review found in the archives of The Spectator from 7 December 1889. Rather, most scholarly examination lumps several or all of Ballantyne's work into one. Due to Ballantyne's dedication to research for authenticity, he wrote in \\"Personal Reminiscences in Book- Making\\" that he aimed to complete as much research on his chosen environment as possible. This made him one of the first writers of fictional adventure stories to carry out background research to make his stories more realistic. Most critics agree that he was well-researched. Michelle Elleray discusses Ballantyne's overt Christianity and \\"his roles as a children's author to involve conveying educational information to boys in an enticing fictional format.\\" She also discusses the self-sufficient nature of Ballantyne's characters, in the context of his conveying education to young raiders: \\"Ballantyne's boys therefore mark a development in the literary articulation of the child's capacity for self-sufficient action.\\"  References  Novels by R.

She was the mother of three rulers of Lan Na: Thado Minsaw (Tu Laung), Minye Deibba and Thado Kyaw. She was an accomplished poet, known for her yadu poems, which are among the earliest records of Lan Na in Burmese literature. Early life Hsinbyushin Medaw was the elder daughter of Thado Dhamma Yaza II, Viceroy of Prome, and his chief queen Salin Mibaya. She was probably born c. 1552. From her mother's side, she was descended from Ava and Prome royal lines; from her father's side, she was a niece of King Bayinnaung. She had one full younger sister Min Taya Medaw and eight half- siblings.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 89 For much of her childhood, her father, who was one of the four principal commanders of the king, was often away on military campaigns. She was educated at the Prome Palace. One of her tutors was a famous and accomplished poet Nawaday, originally of the Ava court.Harvey 1925: 170‚Äì171 She learned from the \\"great master\\" various forms of Burmese poetry, including the yadu style for which she would be remembered.Ni Ni Myint 2004: 17 Princess of Tharrawaddy The princess was married to her first cousin Min Tha Sit, a senior prince and son of King Bayinnaung, at the Kanbawzathadi Palace in Pegu (Bago) by the king himself on 27 February 1574.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 37): Wednesday, 7th waxing of Tabaung 935 ME = Saturday, 27 February 1574 She moved to Tharrawaddy, a town about 150 km south of Prome, where her husband was governor. She found a kindred spirit in Mintha Sit, who also loved literature and poetry.Ni Ni Myint 2004: 21‚Äì22 But Sit was also an ambitious prince who led a campaign to northern Shan states of Mohnyin and Mogaung in 1576‚Äì1577.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 59‚Äì62 It was the first of many campaigns that Sit would be away from her, and their long separations would come to be used as an inspiration for her poetry.Ni Ni Myint 2004: 16 She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on 8 May 1578.Hmannan (Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 178) cites a Nawaday eigyin about the daughter, which states that she was born in the evening of Thursday, 4th waxing of Nayon 940 ME. But 4th waxing of Nayon 940 ME translates to Saturday, 10 May 1578. If she was a Thursday born--most Burmese care more about the day of the week in which they were born, and are unlikely to be mistaken about it--her birth date was probably 2nd waxing of Nayon 940 ME. Queen of Lan Na On 28 January 1579, Mintha Sit was appointed as King of Lan Na with the title of Nawrahta Minsaw by the High King.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 65 With the appointment, Hsinbyushin Medaw, who was pregnant with their second child,Maha Yazawin (Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 152) says the daughter was the youngest. But Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 177) says she was the eldest child. became the chief queen consort of Lan Na. En route to Chiang Mai, she gave birth to a boy whom the couple named Tu Laung () after the place of birth, Mt. Doi Luang.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 67Ni Ni Myint 2004: 19 They ascended to the Chiang Mai throne on 2 July 1579.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 67): Thursday, 10th waxing of 2nd Waso 941 ME = Friday, 2 July 1579 The Emerald Buddha now at Wat Phra Kaew in Bangkok The queen would spend the rest of her life in Lan Na. The royal couple had two more children there. She composed many poems, which are among the earliest extant Burmese language records about life in Lan Na. According to her poems, she went on pilgrimages to the famous Buddhist shrines of Lan Na, in particular Phra Kaew (which at the time housed the Emerald Buddha), Phra Singh, and Phra Suthep. She also used her pilgrimages as opportunities to see the Lan Na countryside, and to be outside the walled city of Chiang Mai.Ni Ni Myint 2004: 20 Her husband, who also enjoyed writing poetry, wrote a famous yadu poem, dedicated to his beloved queen. To be sure, the Burmese royals' reign of the Tai Yuan-speaking kingdom was not all filled with tranquility. In 1584, both Ava and Siam revolted, setting into motion the eventual fall of Toungoo Empire.Harvey 1925: 180‚Äì181 After King Nanda's failed campaigns in Siam (1584‚Äì1593), the political stability of Lan Na itself rapidly deteriorated, with eastern provinces breaking away from Chiang Mai. Since Nanda could not provide any help, Nawrahta Minsaw declared himself independent in 1596/97.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 97 In the following years, he was always on campaigns in the eastern provinces.Fernquest 2005: 47 It is unclear if he was by her side when she died in Chiang Mai c. 1601/02 (963 ME). (According to the Ayutthaya Chronicle, she died while Nawrahta Minsaw prepared to submit to King Naresuan of Siam.) Literary records The chronicle Zinme Yazawin contains some of her more famous yadu poems. According to the historian Ni Ni Myint, yadu is \\"a poetic form in which three stanzas are linked by the rhyming of their last lines, the yadu had its golden age in the 16th and early 17th century. The poem generally evokes a mood of wistful sadness through the contemplation of nature in the changing seasons or the yearning for a loved one temporarily separated.\\" The following is a translation by Ni Ni Myint of one of the queen's famous poems called \\"Victory Land of Golden Yun\\".(Ni Ni Myint 2004: 16): Yun was the Burmese name for the people of Lan Na, and derived from Tai Yuan. The queen composed the poem while her husband was away on campaign in Yunnan in 1582‚Äì1583. :Victory Land of Golden Yun, Our Home :Thronged pleasantly like paradise :The clear waters moving without cease :The forests teeming with singing birds :The breezes replace the sere leaves :As buds peep and petals spread :ingyin, yinma, thawka, tharaphi :gangaw, swedaw, fragrant hpetsut :anan, thazin, gamon, balmy in bloom :Luxuriantly scenting the air in the early summer‚Ä¶ :Yet my love is not here to enjoy :I in loneliness watch the delights :In this season of diverse scents :In Yun City, created by you, lord :And await your return :Topmost of the royal lineage of the sun :Brilliant like the flame of the sun :Ever-triumphant conqueror of the foes :My husband marches boldly to far-off China and Lan Xang :To clear the enveloping enemies‚Ä¶ :Sadly I nurse my loneliness :Clear the enemy before Tagu! :All enemies bow to Chiang Mai City :Encircled by cool waters and wall-like hills :Unequalled Lord of Golden Yun‚Ä¶ :My topmost lineage of the sun :Now that the south wind blows, the sere leaf falls :The golden laburnum flutters, liquid emerald :I do not know how to wear :Fragrant flowers in my top-hair :Since my lion-hearted husband marched to war :I guard my mind and kneeling :Before Buddha‚Äôs images :Of Phra Kaew, Phra Singh, golden Maha Chedi :And the famous Phra Suthep :Images bright as sun :On western hill-top beyond the city, and within :With reverence I say my prayers :Rising glory of the lineage of the sun Notes References Bibliography    Chief queens consort of Toungoo dynasty 1550s births 1600s deaths ","title":"Hsinbyushin Medaw"},{"id":"42541701","text":"This is a list of inhabited places in Germany which are named after people.

A Brief History of Kelly Air Force Base. San Antonio, June 1993. It was closed as part of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. History Kelly's World War II mission turned the base into a huge industrial complex. A new organization, the San Antonio Air Service Command, managed the increased supply and maintenance workload. Kelly workers overhauled, repaired, and modified aircraft, engines, and related equipment. Kelly's maintenance shops worked on thousands of Army aircraft, including B-17s, B-25s, B-29s, P-51s, and the C-47 cargo plane. Rapid production lines established a rate of overhaul on accessories, bombsights, guns, and electrical equipment that set records for both military and commercial repair agencies. By 1944, Kelly's workforce had grown tremendously. In 1939, old Duncan Field had 1,100 civilian employees and only 10 military personnel. By 1945, over 15,000 civilians and 16,000 military worked at Kelly. During World War II, nearly 40 percent of the workers at the field were women. \\"Kelly Katies\\" were the Kelly counterparts to \\"Rosie the Riveters\\", women everywhere who did non-traditional work, contributing greatly to the successful war effort. They worked in nearly every shop at Kelly, including engine overhaul. Because of the need for more storage space, Kelly annexed Normoyle Ordnance Depot, known today as East Kelly, in 1945. An out-processing center for the thousands of soldiers who had received their discharges was also located at Normoyle. After the end of the war, more and more AT-6, P-51, and B-29 aircraft were delivered to Kelly Field for maintenance and storage. Disposal and aircraft storage programs took up more and more of Kelly's time and space. Kelly's maintenance workers stopped repairing very heavy bombers and began supporting the occupational forces in Europe and Japan with air transportation, communications, and weather systems. In 1946, the San Antonio Air Technical Services Command became the San Antonio Air Materiel Area (SAAMA). = 1950s = thumb|Convair XC-99 attached to the MATS 1700th Air Transport Group, Kelly AFB, Texas, 1954. Note San Antonio Air Materiel Area (SAAMA) tail marking, indicating the aircraft was assigned to the Air Materiel Command. As the Air Force moved through its first decade of independence, its aircraft, engines, accessories, and support equipment became increasingly sophisticated and complex, requiring use of new technologies and innovative programs to meet the challenges of the future. On 16 June 1958, prime maintenance responsibility for all items within the Air Force's Nuclear Weapons Program were assigned to SAAMA. The Directorate of Special Weapons remains the only logistical nuclear ordnance manager in the Air Force. It managed all United States Air Force nuclear weapon equipment such as missile re-entry systems, warheads, bomb arming and fusing devices, tools, and tests handling and training equipment. The center repaired and overhauled B-52s for over 30 years. In the early 1960s, the B-52 Stratofortress was the major depot-level maintenance workload for SAAMA. Modifications to the B-52s performed at Kelly increased the load capability of each plane and increased the aircraft's range. In addition, the San Antonio shops camouflage-painted the B-52Gs for Southeast Asia Arc Light operations. This era in Kelly's history ended when the Air Force shifted the B-52 workload to Oklahoma City AMA at Tinker AFB in the spring of 1993. The 36-year-old relationship between Kelly and the big bomber was the longest association between any Air Force weapons system and a single ALC to that point. In August 1962, SAAMA \\"loaned\\" the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) six aircraft - two F-102s, two TF102s and two T33s - so the astronauts at Houston's Manned Spacecraft Center could maintain their flying proficiency. Two years later, Directorate of Maintenance workers built three Apollo capsule trainers for NASA. And Kelly's Directorate of Aerospace Fuels supplied NASA with the required liquid propellants from the very beginning of the Space Administration's push into space. =Vietnam War= Kelly's workload remained relatively stable until the mid-1960s, when American efforts to prevent the fall of the South Vietnamese government led to direct American involvement. Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, all air materiel areas began supporting Southeast Asia on a 24-hour basis. By 31 December 1965, SAAMA had sent 11 supply teams, totaling 89 personnel, on temporary duty to Southeast Asia to establish supply centers throughout the western Pacific, including South Vietnam. Kelly also sent maintenance teams to Southeast Asia. Those who remained in San Antonio also strove to meet the demands for materiel and aircraft maintenance. On 1 July 1965, Kelly opened as an aerial port of embarkation to provide though-plane cargo service to Southeast Asia. Kelly Air Force Base personnel processed and routed vital war material earmarked for South Vietnam to the Southeast Asian Theater. By 1967, the pace of the United States build-up intensified. The C-141A Starlifter cargo aircraft began to enter the Air Force inventory in sufficient numbers to replace the aging C-124 Globemaster II. With air terminal modernization and the increased use of C-141 aircraft, Military Airlift Command (MAC) aircrews seldom experienced any delays at Kelly's aerial port. Northrop F-5B Freedom Fighter (s/n 65-13074) of the 602th Fighter Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, in 1966. It was part of the project \\"Skoshi Tiger\\" to evaluate the F-5. On 1 November 1965, SAAMA assumed responsibility for the Air Force's entire watercraft program. This included all landing-type vessels, spares, engines, and combat ships. Other items included cargo tanks, special service vessels, barges, small craft, dredges, rigging, and marine hardware. Earlier that year, on 3 August, Kelly became responsible for assembly and shipment of the necessary airfield lighting equipment to establish four semi-fixed installations in Southeast Asia. In August 1966, the Air Force Logistics Command established PROJECT LOGGY SORT (LOGGY-Specialize Overseas Repair Test) to study the requirements for repair and maintenance of United States Air Force tactical aircraft in a combat environment in Southeast Asia. The goal was to provide tactical fighter units with greater mobility and flexibility. The F-4C Phantom II aircraft was selected as the test vehicle because it was the most modern system in existence and best represented planned future weapon systems. SAAMA, as manager for the F-4s aerospace ground equipment, accumulated, analyzed and established base level repair restrictions on the items. Weapon systems used in Southeast Asia managed by SAAMA included F-102 Delta Dagger, F-106 Delta Dart, A-37 Dragonfly, O-2 Skymaster, and F-5 Freedom Fighter aircraft, while the major maintenance workloads centered around aircraft engines, airfield lighting equipment, life support system items, aerospace ground equipment, and fuels. Specific maintenance workloads were B-52 aircraft modifications such as the T34, T-56 and J79 engine overhaul and recoverable-aerospace item repair. The early 1970s witnessed the establishment of the Vietnamization Program, also known as the Nixon Doctrine. This new policy was the key to planned reductions in the United States military forces in South Vietnam. As part of this effort, SAAMA personnel were deeply involved in the planning and construction of an engine facility at Bien Hoa Air Base. This assignment began in February 1971 when the Air Force Logistics Command gave the SAAMA the responsibility for developing complete plans and specifications for converting an existing building at Bien Hoa Air Base into an engine overhaul facility. One month later, the San Antonio Air Materiel Area became involved with yet another project to provide logistics support. On 20 October 1972, SAAMA initiated PROJECT ENHANCE PLUS, to transfer A-37, F-5E Tiger II, and T-38 Talon aircraft, engines, and support spares to the Republic of Vietnam to carry on the war after American withdrawal. Nearly every directorate at Kelly contributed to this effort. The San Antonio Air Materiel Area set several records during this period. In addition to the transfer of A-37s, F-5s, and T-38s, over 18.3 million pounds of cargo were sent on 232 missions using C-141, C-5 Galaxy, Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 aircraft. United States Air Force Headquarters congratulated all concerned for their support in this project. They said it was proud of the ability shown by all air logistics centers and other activities to get the job done in spite of the critical time, worldwide scope of the operation, and the many actions which had to be completed. C-5A Galaxy in the 1970s The C-5A Galaxy, the world's largest aircraft, entered the Air Force inventory on 8 June 1970. San Antonio Air Materiel Area had both management and repair responsibility for the giant transport and its TF39 engine. Weighing about 350 tons, the aircraft can transport 98 percent of equipment issued to an Army division, including the 100,000 pound M-1 tank, self-propelled artillery equipment, missiles, and helicopters. On its initial visit to Kelly on 31 January 1970, prominent figures as well as public spectators greeted the C-5A. = Post-Vietnam era = In 1974, San Antonio Air Materiel Area changed its name to the San Antonio Air Logistics Center, but the dedication and support to the Air Force mission remained the same. Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan engine The F100 engine became a major engine workload for Kelly in the late 1970s as F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15 Eagles entered the Air Force inventory in increasing numbers. Air Force officials predicted the F100 to be Kelly's largest overhaul workload since the Pratt and Whitney R4360 engine, which dominated overhaul activities at the base for more than a decade. The San Antonio Air Materiel Area was designated as the Specialized Repair Activity for the F100 in 1969. =Closure= Kelly AFB document, 1993 During Operation Just Cause, Kelly served as a transit point for more than 8,200 troops deploying to Panama and as a reception site for some 250 incoming wounded service members. Later, the base moved more than 10,000 short tons of material and 4,700 passengers and deployed 17 million pounds of munitions to Southwest Asia for Operation Desert Storm. During the 1990s, it supported US operations in Kosovo. In 1992, a major defense reorganization had shifted ownership of most of Kelly's warehouse space from the Air Force to the new Defense Logistics Agency. The following year, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission added Kelly and three other logistics centers to the list of installations marked for closure. Local officials convinced the commissioners to spare the base, but it was only a temporary stay. Kelly Air Force Base was closed because the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decided the base's workload should be consolidated with that of other Air Force depots. At the same time McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, California, was also closed. Instead of shifting all workloads, some were outsourced or privatized by the Clinton administration. Parts of the installation were shifted to Lackland Air Force Base, with a significant portion becoming Port San Antonio. Present use 1,873 acres (7.58 km¬≤) of land, including hangars and industrial facilities previously known as the San Antonio Air Logistics Center, is operated by the Greater Kelly Development Authority (a political subdivision of the State of Texas, now renamed the Port Authority of San Antonio) as the Port San Antonio business park.

Hans Jonatan (1784‚Äì1827; also known as Hans Jonathan) was the subject of an important test case in Danish law on slavery. Fleeing to Iceland, he became one of the first people of African descent to live in Iceland. Later, he became the subject of a groundbreaking DNA study. Parents Hans Jonatan was born a slave on the plantation at Constitution Hill on the island of St Croix in the Caribbean, which had become a Danish colony in 1733 when purchased by the Danish West India Company from France. His paternity is uncertain, but P√°lsson argues in his biography that his father was a white Dane, Hans Gram, who was the secretary of his owners for three years; his mother was Emilia Regina, a black 'house slave' who is first recorded in 1773 at the St Croix plantation of La Reine, where she was presumably born. In 1788, Emilia had a daughter, Anna Maria, this time by a black man, Andreas, who at the time was a house slave too; but their fates are not recorded. The details of the West African ancestry of Hans's mother were unknown prior to a genetic study. Hans Jonatan was owned by Heinrich Ludvig Ernst von Schimmelmann and his wife Henriette Catharina. Life in Denmark In 1789 the Schimmelmann family moved to Copenhagen as the plantation business took a downturn, bringing Emilia Regina and, later, Hans Jonatan with them. Not long afterwards, Heinrich died, bequeathing Hans to his widow Henriette Catharine. In 1801, at the age of seventeen, Hans Jonatan escaped and joined the Danish Navy. He participated in the Battle of Copenhagen, for which he received recognition. Danish crown prince Frederick gave him his freedom as a reward. Subsequently, Henriette had Jonathan arrested, claiming that he was her property and that she had intended to sell him in the West Indies. Jonathan and his lawyer argued before a Copenhagen court under judge Anders Sand√∏e √òrsted (who would later become Prime Minister of Denmark) that although slavery was still legal in the Danish West Indies, it was illegal in Denmark and Hans Jonatan could not be kept as a slave. However, in the case Generalmajorinde Henriette de Schimmelmann contra mulatten Hans Jonathan 1802, √òrsted sentenced him on March 31, 1802 to be returned to the West Indies. Life in Iceland Dj√∫pivogur's trading station, where Hans Jonatan worked. Hans Jonatan escaped again, and his fate remained unknown to the Danish administration. It was only around the 1990s that the rest of his story was pieced together and started to become generally known. In 1802, he arrived in Dj√∫pivogur in Iceland. One of the first records of Hans Jonatan after 1802 is in the diary of the Norwegian cartographer Hans Frisak for August 4, 1812: ::The agent at the trading post here is from the West Indies, and has no surname ... but calls himself Hans Jonatan. He is very dark-skinned and has coal-black, curly hair. His father is European but his mother a negro. Frisak hired Hans Jonatan as a guide. Hans lived as a peasant farmer at Borgargar√∞ur working at the Danish trading station in Dj√∫pivogur. He took over the running of the trading post in 1819. By February 1820, Hans had married Katr√≠n Anton√≠usd√≥ttir from H√°ls. They had three children; two survived childhood, and their living descendants now number nearly nine hundred. Hans Jonatan died in 1827. Genetic study In 2018, scientists achieved a genetic breakthrough when they reconstructed a part of his genome solely using samples from his descendants and none from his remains. This was the first time that a human genome had been reconstructed without using physical remains. For the study, 788 of his descendants were identified, and DNA samples from 182 family members were taken. The study was aided by the extreme rarity of African heritage in Iceland, the homogeneity of the country's population, and its comprehensive genealogical database. The samples were analyzed against known signs of African DNA, recreating about 38% of his mother's DNA profile and thus 19% of his own. It was determined that his mother's ancestral origins were from a region now encompassing Nigeria, Benin, and Cameroon.Anuradha Jagadeesan and others, 'Reconstructing an African Haploid Genome from the 18th Century', Nature Genetics, 50(2) (2018), 199‚Äì205 . Despite the popular tale of former prime minister Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson being Jonatan's descendant, no sources back up that claim.

It was under control of the Independent State of Croatia until September 1941, when Italian forces gradually put it under their command and established additional units not only in Sand≈æak, but in eastern Herzegovina as well. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 it was put under German control, while some of its units were merged with three battalions of Albanian collaborationist troops to establish the \\"SS Polizei-Selbstschutz- Regiment Sandschak\\" under command of the senior Waffen SS officer Karl von Krempler. The Sand≈æak Muslim militia had around 2,000 men in standing forces and additional auxiliary forces on local level. Its notable commanders include Hasan Zvizdiƒá, Husein Rovƒçanin, Sulejman Paƒçariz, ƒÜazim Sijariƒá, Selim Jukoviƒá, Biko Dre≈°eviƒá, ƒÜamil Hasanagiƒá and Galjan Lukaƒç. It was one of three armed groups, besides the Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans, that operated in Sand≈æak during the Second World War and engaged in violent internecine fight. Moslem militia participated in the suppression of the Uprising in Montenegro, committing numerous crimes against Serbs of Montenegro. After the suppression of the uprising this militia continued to fight against Yugoslav Partisans, but some of its units also carried on with attacks on Serbs in Sand≈æak and eastern Herzegovina. According to German and Croatian sources, the size of Muslim militia in April 1943 was between 8,000 and 12,000 men.  Background  The Sand≈æak is a mountainous region that lies along the border between modern-day Serbia and Montenegro. A significant Muslim minority has formed part of the population of the region since the Ottoman Empire annexation of the Serbian Despotate in 1459. A history of hatred, frequent harassment and occasional violence directed towards the Sand≈æak Muslims by their Serb neighbors meant that they had generally maintained a system of mutual protection to keep watch over their communities and property. Prior to the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Sand≈æak had been joined to Bosnia and Herzegovina under Ottoman rule. Between 1929 and 1941, the Sand≈æak had been part of the Zeta Banovina (province) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, whose boundaries, like those of five of the other eight banovina, were gerrymandered to ensure a Serb majority which would protect the interests of the Serbian ruling elite of Yugoslavia. In the 1931 census, the counties of Bijelo Polje, De≈æeva, Mile≈°eva, Nova Varos, Pljevlja, Priboj, Sjenica, and ≈†tavica had a combined population of 204,068, with 43 per cent (87,939) being Sand≈æak Muslims with a small number of Albanians, and 56.5 per cent (115,260) being Orthodox Serbs or Montenegrins.  Initial reactions to the invasion  alt=a coloured map In April 1941, Germany and its Axis allies invaded and occupied Yugoslavia. German troops from the 8th and 11th Panzer Divisions entered the Sand≈æak on 16 April, and had occupied the whole region by 19 April. In all cases the county officials and gendarmes surrendered peacefully, but there were no demonstrations of support for the Germans until they arrived in each community. In Sjenica, Nova Varos, Priboj, Prijepolje and Bijelo Polje the streets were deserted when the Germans arrived, with shops closed and most people staying inside their homes. In Novi Pazar parts of the community prepared a welcome for the Germans when they became aware of their approach from Ra≈°ka. When the Germans arrived in town on 17 April, German flags bearing the swastika were being flown, and the troops were met by a welcoming committee who greeted them with a short speech. The welcoming committee included the inter-war mayor of the town, Aƒáif Had≈æiahmetoviƒá, as well as Stjepan Fi≈°er, Ahmet Daca, and Ejup Ljajiƒá. In Pljevlja some elements of the community, including the county and municipal mayors, met the Germans at the outskirts of the town and held a reception to welcome them. In Prijepolje, a meeting of prominent Serb and Muslim men was called before the Germans arrived, and during which the Serb Sreten Vukosavljeviƒá urged Serbs and Muslims to maintain good relations and treat the occupation as temporary. Only the mayor met the Germans when they arrived in town. The Germans withdrew to Pljevlja for a few days, and patrols each consisting of one Serb and one Muslim maintained law and order. On 19 April, the Germans called a meeting of Muslim notables from Novi Pazar, Sjenica, and Tutin. The meeting was held the following day in Kosovska Mitrovica, and also included representatives of the Muslim and Albanian communities of Kosovska Mitrovica, Vuƒçitrn, Podujevo, Pristina, Peƒá, Istok and Drenica. The 60 delegates at the meeting were addressed by the commander of the German 60th Infantry Division Generalleutnant Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt, who told the assembly that the Germans had liberated the Albanians from the Serbs, and that he was now inviting the Albanians to take over the administration of the Kosovo region. He also said that during his division's advance from Skopje (the capital of modern-day Macedonia) to Kosovska Mitrovica they had seen that the Serb Chetniks had killed 3,000 Albanians. He stated that the Kosovo region would be part of the German-occupied territory of Serbia, under a German-dominated government in Belgrade. This statement was received in stony silence. Eberhardt then told the group that all Serbs in the Kosovo area would eventually be resettled in Serbia, and Kosovo would then contain only Albanians, Muslims and Catholics. The meeting then discussed the situation, and decided that the former Yugoslav structures and authorities in the region would be disarmed and dismantled, and that all Serb officials would be dismissed. As soon as the Sand≈æak Muslim leaders returned to their communities from the meeting in Kosovska Mitrovica, they installed members of their inner circles in the towns of Novi Pazar, Sjenica, and Tutin, including the town guard, courts, tax administration and postal services. This was then extended to Muslim villages in those districts. In Bijelo Polje and Pljevlja, the pre- war district and municipal mayors remained in place. ≈†tavica district was transferred to Italian-controlled Albania. After a few days, rumours surfaced in Prijepolje that Serb Chetniks were approaching the town, and the Muslim population prepared to arm themselves in self-defence. An munition accident occurred at a meeting called to distribute weapons, and four were killed and more wounded. The Germans soon arrived to investigate, and were convinced by pro-German Muslims that Serbs had intentionally caused the explosion. They rounded up non-Muslims, as well as at least one Muslim communist, and lined them up against a wall. Other Muslims intervened to save them, telling the Germans the explosion was caused by negligence, not the Serbs. The Germans only disarmed the Yugoslav gendarmerie in Tutin and nearby Crkvine. In all other centres they allowed the gendarmes to retain their weapons. Throughout the Sand≈æak, the communists successfully convinced a portion of the population not to surrender their weapons to the Germans as they had been ordered, but their efforts were opposed by pro-German elements of the community who encouraged the handing-in of arms. The Germans initially allowed officers of the defeated Yugoslav Army to return to their homes, so long as they reported regularly to the local garrison. This was intended to ensure that the officers were able to be easily located and interned.  Partition of Yugoslavia  alt=a coloured map showing the partition of Yugoslavia Yugoslavia was soon partitioned. Some Yugoslav territory was annexed by its Axis neighbors, Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy. The Italians also occupied Montenegro with the intention of setting up a vassal state, and the borders of this territory included most of the Sand≈æak. The Germans engineered and supported the creation of the Usta≈°e-led puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), which roughly comprised most of the pre-war Banovina Croatia, along with rest of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and some adjacent territory. The Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians occupied other parts of Yugoslavian territory. Germany did not annex any Yugoslav territory, but occupied northern parts of present-day Slovenia and stationed occupation troops in the northern half of the NDH. The remaining territory, which consisted of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government.  The struggle over the Sand≈æak  = German-Italian demarcation line = The demarcation line between areas of German and Italian responsibility through occupied Yugoslavia was determined at a meeting of the German and Italian foreign ministers in Vienna on 21‚Äì22 April 1941. Two days later, Adolf Hitler set the initial boundary (known as the Vienna Line) through the Sand≈æak along the line Priboj-Novi Pazar, with both those towns falling on the German side of the line. The Germans were not quick to hand over parts of the region to the Italians, maintaining their occupation troops throughout the Sand≈æak, and initially only allowing the Italians to garrison Bijelo Polje. They were not confident in the ability of the Italians to secure the region, and did not want to rely on Serb collaborationists, at least initially. While they were able to establish co-operation with local Muslim authorities in Novi Pazar and Tutin, matters were not so straightforward in other towns of the region. Key German interests in the Sand≈æak included mineral exploitation and the important route towards Greece through the Ibar valley. = NDH designs on the Sand≈æak = Usta≈°e ideologists considered the Sand≈æak to be an integral part of NDH, and they wanted to occupy cities in Montenegro and the Sand≈æak, thereby establishing a common border with Bulgaria. On 29 April, a platoon of Usta≈°e troops arrived in Prijepolje, where they were welcomed by local Muslims. The platoon commander gave a short speech and addressed a meeting at a school, declaring that the Sand≈æak had been annexed to the NDH, and telling all the local officials they must swear an oath to their new country. Part of the platoon was stationed at the railway station at Uvac near Sjenica, and part was sent to Priboj. The aspirations of the Usta≈°e were given additional impetus by the Sand≈æak Muslims, who sent a letter to the Poglavnik (leader) of the NDH, Ante Paveliƒá on 30 April 1941. The letter, sent via Sarajevo, stated that the Sand≈æak was both economically and historically part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and asked that the Sand≈æak be incorporated into the NDH. It also asked that Paveliƒá send a detachment of Usta≈°e militia to every district of the Sand≈æak, stating that such action had the full support of the Germans. The letter was signed \\"on behalf of the districts of the Sand≈æak\\" without specifying which districts were represented, although of the 38 signatories, Pljevlja and Prijepolje supplied ten each, six were from Sjenica, there were five each from Priboj and Bijelo Polje, and two from Nova Varo≈°. There were no signatories from Novi Pazar or Tutin. During the period immediately after the invasion, there were several opposing currents among the Muslims of the Sand≈æak. Some wanted to join the NDH, others wanted to join the Italian protectorate of Albania, a group wanted to ally themselves with the pro-German Had≈æiahmetoviƒá in Novi Pazar, and yet others wanted to work with the separatist Montenegrin \\"Greens\\". This divergence of views was reflected in a meeting at Bijelo Polje, which favoured joining the NDH, although a significant minority supported aligning themselves with Had≈æiahmetoviƒá. In the eastern part of the Sand≈æak, there were also significant numbers of Albanians, who were agitating for the enlargement of neighboring Albania to include large areas of the Sand≈æak. = NDH gendarmerie moves in = On 3 May 1941, a battalion of the NDH gendarmerie began to deploy into the Sand≈æak from Sarajevo. For propaganda purposes, they wore the Muslim fez instead of their usual headgear. Over the following two days, the battalion established itself in Priboj, Prijepolje, Pljevlja and Nova Varos, with companies based at Uvac, Priboj, Prijepolje and Nova Varos. The NDH gendarmes disarmed all Serb gendarmes, and brought in several key people from Bosnia, who were appointed as district chiefs and as leaders of the Usta≈°e Youth organisation. On 5 May, a company arrived at Pljevlja and demanded that the Germans immediately hand over the town to them. The Germans refused as they were preparing to handover to the Italians, who were due to take over the town three days later. At Nova Varos, the NDH gendarmes had a cool reception, the Usta≈°e district commissioner being a man brought in from Vi≈°egrad in eastern Bosnia. On 10 May, the Italians ordered the NDH gendarmes out of Pljevlja and dismantled the Usta≈°e administration in the town, as they were concerned about the NDH push to annex the Sand≈æak. By this time, combined German and NDH garrisons were in place in Priboj, Prijepolje and Nova Varos, and Bijelo Polje and Pljevlja were under strictly Italian control. The Germans controlled Sjenica, Tutin and Novi Pazar. = German troop withdrawal = Before withdrawing their troops from the Sand≈æak to prepare for the pending invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans wanted to quickly establish collaborationist control over the area. The NDH government saw this development as benefiting their aspiration to annex the Sand≈æak. On 10 May, a large group of Muslims from Nova Varo≈° wrote to Hakija Had≈æiƒá, Usta≈°e commissioner for Bosnia, requesting that he establish an administration in that town, stating that while Muslims made up 70 per cent of the municipal population, the town was surrounded by Serb villages, whose populace they feared. = Changes to the Vienna Line = In mid-May, the Sand≈æak portion of the Vienna Line was modified, with the border following the line Priboj-Nova Varo≈°-Sjenica-Novi Pazar, all of which fell on the north (German) side of the line. On 15 May, a delegation of Muslims from the Sand≈æak arrived in Zagreb and handed a petition to Paveliƒá asking that the whole Sand≈æak be annexed by the NDH. They referred to themselves as \\"Croatian Muslims\\" and stated that they were seeking to avoid the partition of the Sand≈æak between various powers. There were further changes to the Vienna Line on 21 May, when the Italians took over the communities of Rudo (in the NDH), Priboj, Nova Varo≈°, Sjenica and Duga Poljana, but Novi Pazar remained in German hands. On 20 May, German motorised troops were withdrawn from Prijepolje, Nova Varos and Priboj and were replaced by two companies of infantry. Bijelo Polje was garrisoned by a company of Italian infantry. When they arrived in town, the Italians were met by a group of both Serb and Muslim \\"Greens\\". Through clumsy statements about the friendship between Italians and Montenegrins, without mentioning Muslims, the Italians offended these Muslims, who shifted their support to an alliance with the NDH. Despite the forming of a German-Italian commission in November 1941 to review the line through the Sand≈æak, no further changes occurred until the Italian surrender in early September 1943. Given their interests, neither the NDH government nor the Sand≈æak Muslims were happy with these arrangements. = Pro-NDH coup in Sjenica = On 13 June, in the absence of a German garrison in Sjenica, pro-NDH Muslims overthrew the pro-Albanian administration, and wrote to Slavko Kvaternik, the NDH Minister of the Armed Forces asking that he immediately send NDH troops to garrison the town. They also sent a delegation to Prijepolje, asking the commander of the NDH garrison to send troops. He led a platoon of soldiers and a team of gendarmes who established themselves in the town, meeting with the small German garrison. In July, Duga Poljana was transferred to De≈æeva County, and was then controlled from Novi Pazar rather than Sjenica. = Formation of armed groups = The pro-NDH and pro-Albanian factions within the Muslim population of the Sand≈æak began to organise armed groups, and this contributed to a deterioration in the relationship between Serbs and Muslims. Some Muslims even demanded that all the Serbs that had been settled in the region since World War I be expelled. Serbs reacted strongly to this demand, with their leaders in Pljevlja stating that any attempts at such evictions would be opposed by armed force.  Establishment of the Muslim militia  As soon as Yugoslav resistance ended, the Sand≈æak Muslims strengthened their collective security arrangements by the gathering of volunteers armed with abandoned Royal Yugoslav Army weapons. In the period between 29 April and 8 May 1941, Usta≈°e forces executed their order to capture Sand≈æak. Between April or June and August 1941 they established Moslem Usta≈°e militia in the Sand≈æak, with strongholds in Brodarevo, Komaran, Hisard≈æik and parts of Novi Pazar, ≈†taviƒçki and Sjenica. On 15 May 1941 a group of Muslims from Pljevlja, Bijelo Polje and Prijepolje wrote to Pavelic and expressed the loyalty to NDH allegedly in the name of all Muslims of Sandjak. This way, besides German and Italian forces, Usta≈°e forces were established on the territory of Sand≈æak. The Germans placed the town of Novi Pazar under the control of the Albanian nationalist Balli Komb√´tar supporter Aƒáif Had≈æiahmetoviƒá. On the territory of Sand≈æak there were many detachments of Moslem militia. All of them fought against Yugoslav Partisans in the all period of the existence of this militia. Moslem militia had standing forces of around 2,000 men who received salary and occasionally mobilized forces that were not paid. There were also auxiliary units organized in seven detachments on the municipality level. = Uprising in Montenegro = The Sand≈æak Muslim militia participated in the suppression of the Uprising in Montenegro, committing numerous crimes against Serbs of Montenegro and Montenegrins. The militia was ordered to attack Serb and Montenegrin villages. On 19 July Moslem militia participated in attack on Serb villages on the right bank of river Lim. Units of Moslem militia from Sjenica and Korita opened additional front- line against insurgents after they captured Bijelo Polje on 20 July 1941. On 17 August 1941, the militia killed 11 villagers in Slatina village near Brodarevo. A detachment of Muslim militia from Bihor commanded by Rastoder attacked insurgents toward Berane. Muslim militia from Pljevlja helped Italians to burn and plunder the insurgents' houses during the Italian reprisals after the Battle of Pljevlja.  Italian administration  Because of the unstable situation in Montenegro, the Usta≈°e remained in Sand≈æak only until the beginning of September 1941. When the Usta≈°e were forced to leave Sand≈æak, Muslims who were allied with them and their Moslem militia were left alone, and they allied themselves with the occupying Italian forces. In eastern parts of Sand≈æak, Muslim militia collaborated with German and Albanian forces. In autumn 1941 the Italians appointed Osman Rastoder as a commander of the Muslim militia detachment in upper Bihor with its seat in Petnjica. The detachment of militia in Gostun was commanded by Selim Jukoviƒá.At the end of September 1941, the militia from Tutin participated in the attack on Ibarski Kola≈°in, predominantly populated by Serbs. In Sjenica a wealthy Muslim whole- trader Hasan Zvizdiƒá became a city governor who armed many local Muslims and organized them as militia. In mid November 1941 Chetnik unit of 40 men went to Kosatica trying to disarm Muslim militia commanded by Sulejman Paƒçariz. Militiamen refused to surrender their arms and in subsequent struggle two of them were killed while one Chetnik was wounded. To revenge death of his two men, Muslim militia under command of Paƒçariz attacked part of Kosatica populated by Serbs and captured, brutally tortured and killed seven Serbs from Kosatica. Commanders of Muslim militia (including Osman Rastoder, Sulejman Paƒçariz, ƒÜazim Sijariƒá and Husein Rovƒçanin) participated in a conference in village of Godijeva, and agreed to attack Serb villages near Sjenica and other parts of Sand≈æak. On 31 March 1942, Chetnik leader Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá met with Rastoder and offered him a peace agreement between Muslims and Orthodox people. Rastoder refused the proposed agreement. At the beginning of February 1942 detachments of Muslim militia from Sjenica, Prijepolje, Brodarevo and Komaran, together with Chetniks under command of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá and Italian forces were planned to attack Partisans who were retreating through Sand≈æak after their defeat in U≈æice. When Paƒçariz realized that Partisans managed to defeat Chetniks, he did not dare to attack Partisans, but decided to move his forces to Sjenica to help Zvizdiƒá in case Partisans decide to attack the town again. When Italian forces recaptured ƒåajniƒçe (modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina) in April 1942, they established a detachment of Moslem militia of about 1,500 men and supplied part of them with arms. The Moslem militia in Jabuka (near Foƒça) was commanded by Husin-beg Cengiƒá. Moslem militia in Bijelo Polje was founded by ƒÜazim Sijariƒá, Vehbo Buƒçan and Galjan Lukaƒç. In April 1942 Italians established a battalion of Moslem militia in Metaljka, near ƒåajniƒçe, composed of about 500 Muslims from villages near Pljevlja and ƒåajniƒçe. A little later a command post of Moslem militia was established in Bukovica, near Pljevlja. It was commanded by Latif Moƒáeviƒá whose units attacked and killed local Serbs since the end of May 1942. In Gora≈æde and Foƒça, in retaliation for killings of Serbs by the Moslem militia, Chetniks killed around 5,000 Muslim men, women and children at the end of 1941 and in 1942. The Prijepolje Conference was organized on 7 and 8 September and attended by the political and religious representatives of the both Christian and Muslim population of Sand≈æak, including the representatives of their armed forces. They all agreed on the resolution to resolve any disputes peacefully, to allow all refugees to return to their homes and to provide them help in food and other necessities. This agreement was not respected. Chetnik headquarter continued to receive reports about Muslim attacks on Serb population. In December 1942 around 3,000 Muslims attacked Serbian village Buƒëevo and several surrounding villages near Sjenica, burned Serb houses and killed Serb civilians. According to Chetnik sources, Muslims were preparing to expel Serbs who lived on the territory at the right bank of Lim, Pljevlja, ƒåajniƒçe and Foƒça. Montenegrin Chetniks commanded by Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá pursued raids of revenge against Muslims in Sand≈æak, many being innocent villagers, with original motive to settle account with Moslem militias. On 7 January 1943 unit commanded by ƒÜazim Sijariƒá distinguished itself during attack of Chetniks led by Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá who burned many Muslim villages near Bijelo Polje. On 10 January 1943, ƒêuri≈°iƒá reported that Chetniks under his command had burned down 33 Muslim villages in Bijelo Polje, killed 400 members of the Moslem militia, and had also killed about 1,000 Muslim women and children. Chetniks had 14 killed and 26 wounded men. After subsequent attack of Chetniks from Sand≈æak and Bosnia on Bukovica (village near Pljevlja), they fought against Moslem militia and, according to the report of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá, killed around 1,200 combatants and 8,000 civilians. In period February ‚Äî June 1943 Muslim militia and Albanian forces burned almost all Serb villages in Tutin, Sjenica, Prijepolje and Novi Pazar and killed many people. According to the historian, Professor Jozo Tomasevich, all the circumstances of these \\"cleansing actions\\" carried out by Chetniks against Muslims in the Sand≈æak were a partial implementation of the directive issued to ƒêuri≈°iƒá by Mihailoviƒá in December 1941, which had ordered the cleansing of the Muslim population from the Sand≈æak. In July 1943 Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá proposed to leaders of Muslim militia to agree to cooperate with Chetniks to fight against communists. In August 1943 Chetnik representative and Muslim leaders of De≈æevo met in village Pilareta and agreed to cease all hostilities between armed Muslim forces and Chetniks and to cooperate to fight against Partisans. All Chetniks' units in Sand≈æak were ordered not to confront with Muslims. Many commanders of Muslim militia gathered their people and publicly expressed their opinion that Chetniks are better than Partisans who they considered as robbers. Political leaders of Sand≈æak Muslims (Aƒáif Had≈æiahmetoviƒá) and Albanians (Xhafer Deva) agreed that Sand≈æak should be annexed by the Independent State of Croatia or divided between Croatia and Albania.  German administration  After the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943, Chetniks attacked and captured many Italian garrisons in Sand≈æak. On 11 and 12 September 1943 Chetniks tried to capture Prijepolje, but German forces supported by Muslim militia forced them to retreat with heavy casualties. During the German administration of Sand≈æak, after the capitulation of Italy, every detachment of the Moslem militia was obliged to provide a certain number of men for German military units. Commanders of Muslim militia chose the most capable young soldiers and send them to Novi Pazar to be trained by the SS troops. Some of them were sent to Eastern Front. When German forces took control over Pljevlja from Italians, they armed around 400 members of Moslem militia. In Sjenica the German commanded Moslem militia killed 50 Chetniks. Hasan Zvizdiƒá equipped them with new, German, uniforms, allowing them to keep fez. Following his appointment to the post of H√∂here SS-und Polizeif√ºhrer Sandschak (Higher SS and Police Leader Sand≈æak) in September 1943, Karl von Krempler came to be known as the \\"Sanjak Prince\\" after his relatively successful formation of the \\"SS Polizei- Selbstschutz-Regiment Sandschak\\" (or Self-Defense Regiment ‚ÄúSandschak‚Äù, ). He went to the Sand≈æak in October and took over the local volunteer militia of around 5,000 anti-communist, anti-Serb Muslim men headquartered in Sjenica. This formation was sometimes thereafter called the Kampfgruppe Krempler or more derisively the \\"Muselmanengruppe von Krempler\\". This military unit was created by joining the three battalions of Albanian collaborationist troops with some units of Moslem militia. As the senior Waffen SS officer Karl von Krempler appointed a token local Muslim named Hafiz Sulejman Paƒçariz as the formal commander of the unit, but as the key military trainer and contact person with German arms and munitions, remained effectively in control. In Bijelo Polje Moslem militia had two detachments. One was commanded by ƒÜazim Sijariƒá and the other was under command of Galjan Lukaƒç. Both of them were subordinated to Krempler. In November 1943 Germans ordered Muslims and Chetniks in Sand≈æak to cease their hostilities and to cooperate united under the German command. On 15 November he ordered to Sijariƒá to establish communication with local Chetnik detachments and together with them and detachment of Muslim militia commanded by Galijan, to attack communist forces in Bijelo Polje. Sijariƒá followed German orders. At the end of December 1943, Rovƒçanin was in command of the Muslim militia in the Sand≈æak. On 3 February 1944 the units of the Muslim militia under command of Mula Jakup and also Biko Dre≈°eviƒá, Sinan Salkoviƒá and Faik Bahtijareviƒá attacked villages around Kola≈°in. They were supported by Balli Komb√´tar forces from Drenica. At the beginning of April 1944 the Muslim militia participated in the battle against Partisans near Ivanjica, together with German, Chetnik and Nedic's forces. In September 1944 Tito proclaimed general amnesty, allowing collaborators to switch sides, and almost all older members of militia deserted. On 22 September 1944 the Moslem militia surrendered Pljevlja to Partisans without resistance. After being defeated by Partisans during their attack on Sjenica on 14 October, Paƒçariz and his Regiment left Sand≈æak and went to Sarajevo in November 1944 where \\"SS Polizei-Selbstschutz-Regiment Sandschak\\" was put under the command of Usta≈°e General Maks Luburiƒá.  Aftermath  Sulejman Paƒçariz was captured near Banja Luka in 1945, put on trial and found guilty for massacres of civilians. He was executed as war criminal.

It was recorded for their 1973 self-titled album and released as a double A-side with the song \\"Personality Crisis\\" in July 1973. \\"Trash\\" did not chart upon its release, but has since been hailed by music critics as an anthemic glam rock and proto-punk song. In 2009, the band recorded a reggae-styled remake of the song for their album Cause I Sez So.  Music and lyrics  \\"Trash\\" begins immediately with its chorus, in which lead vocalist David Johansen sings dramatically and implores the song's subject‚Äî\\"my sweet baby\\"‚Äîto not throw her \\"life away.\\" Journalist and author Phil Strongman interpreted the singer's appeal to his subject as being in the context of a socially deviant New York City: \\"in under four minutes, it tells a bittersweet'n'sour low-life love story ‚Äì how does the girl call her lover-boy? 'Trash!' ‚Äì in majestic trash- Glam style. These people might be hookers, rent boys, junkies, sneak thieves ‚Äì or so the lyrics imply ‚Äì but they're still human beings and their subject matter is still tragedy.\\" Johansen quotes the lyric \\"how do you call your lover boy\\" from Mickey & Sylvia's 1956 song \\"Love Is Strange\\". According to music critic Robert Christgau, Johansen used ambiguity as a lyrical mode on the song, particularly when the lyric \\"please don't you ask me if I love you\\" is followed by \\"if you don't know what I do\\", and later by \\"'Cause I don't know why I do\\". He replaces the phrase \\"life\\" in \\"Don't take my life away\\" with \\"knife\\", \\"night\\", and \\"lights\\" when singing the lyric at different times throughout the song. Both Strongman and rock photographer Bob Gruen felt that the other chorus about needing to \\"pick up\\" trash gave the song an ecological theme: \\"Trash, pick it up, don't throw my life away.\\" \\"Trash\\" concludes with a double-beat ending that producer Todd Rundgren embellished with high-pitched background vocals, which were inspired by The Herd's 1968 song \\"From the Underworld\\". According to Strongman, \\"The song's soaring finale suggests that all these problems ‚Äì chemical, emotional, environmental ‚Äì might just be overcome by the sheer power of love'n'lust ‚Äì young rock'n'roll romance, by the passion of young people.\\"  Release and reception  \\"Trash\\" was released by Mercury Records as a double A-side with the song \\"Personality Crisis\\" in July 1973. The single did not chart. In her review for The New Yorker at the time, music critic Ellen Willis wrote that the song is a \\"transcendent\\" highlight on an album full of \\"instant classics\\". She interpreted the single's second A-side, \\"Personality Crisis\\", as \\"a statement about the band ‚Äî about clashing cultures and the dilemma of preserving one's uniqueness while reaching out to others.\\" In a retrospective review, Jon Matsumoto of the Los Angeles Times praised Johansen's \\"bratty vocalizing\\" on \\"Trash\\", which he called a \\"punky pop-rock anthem.\\" Treble named it one of 10 Essential Proto-punk tracks. Music writer and broadcaster Jon Savage named it the 13th best glam rock song of all time in a 2013 list for The Guardian, in which he wrote: According to Strongman, \\"Trash\\" may have been the most \\"passionate\\" of all the New York Dolls' songs. Music journalist Tony Fletcher later said that, as with \\"Personality Crisis\\" and \\"Jet Boy\\", the addition of background vocals and piano helped make \\"Trash\\" into an anthemic glitter rock song, while Kirk Lake cited it as a proto-punk classic in The Rough Guide to Rock (2003).

History Construction of the Pacific Air Depot began in 1935, and the main structures, including administrative buildings, barracks, warehouses and a hospital were completed on 18 April 1938. It was one of only four such air depots in the country. In 1938 the base was renamed Sacramento Air Depot and underwent a major expansion as a repair and overhaul facility for P-38 and P-39 fighter planes. The planes were serviced on an assembly line basis. In 1940 an assembly line was added to overhaul P-40 fighters. In December 1941, soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, P-40s as well as B-26 and B-17 bombers began arriving at the field to be armed and prepared for immediate shipment overseas. Some B-17s came direct to McClellan from the factories. During this time most of the Army Air Forces planes that went to the Pacific Theater were prepared at McClellan. In March 1942 Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle's B-25s arrived at McClellan for arming in preparation for their famous Tokyo raid. The Doolittle Raiders practiced their aircraft carrier takeoff techniques at the Willows Airport in Glenn County, about 90 miles north on Highway 99: The airport runway was painted to represent the flight deck of the aircraft carrier . During World War II, numerous planes arrived at McClellan from all over the U.S. to be armed and otherwise prepared for shipment overseas to combat areas. After the war McClellan became a storage center of several types of aircraft including B-29 bombers. The base was renamed McClellan Air Force Base in 1948 and its repair and overhaul mission continued throughout the Cold War as an installation of the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and later the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), with the overhaul facility being known as the Sacramento Air Logistics Center. The SALC had the 2874th Test Squadron assigned to it from 15 January 1988 - 30 September 1992. It conducted flight tests on aircraft returning to active service after depot maintenance, modification, or repair. In 1992, the squadron was consolidated with the 337th Tactical Fighter Squadron as the 337th Test Squadron. It was inactivated with the closure of McClellan AFB. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, McClellan functioned as the main depot for overhauling the Air Force's General Dynamics F-111, FB-111 and EF-111 aircraft, as well as the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. It also hosted a tenant WC-135 unit and supported the sophisticated electronic Operation Red Flag at Nellis AFB Nevada. A small contingent of F-111D and F-111F aircraft of the 431st Test and Evaluation Squadron, 57 Fighter Weapons Wing, Nellis AFB Nevada was also detached to McClellan. =Previous names= * Pacific Air Depot, 1935 - 1 February 1937 * Sacramento Air Depot 1 February 1937 - 1 December 1939 = Major command assignments = * Materiel Division, United States Army Air Corps, 24 August 1938 - 11 December 1941 * Air Service Command, 11 December 1941 - 17 July 1944 * Army Air Forces Materiel and Services Command, 17 July 1944 - 31 August 1944 * Army Air Forces Technical Service Command, 31 August 1944 - 1 July 1945 * Air Technical Service Command, 1 July 1945 - 9 March 1946 * Air Materiel Command, 9 March 1946 - 1 April 1961 * Air Force Logistics Command, 1 April 1961 - 1 July 1992 * Air Force Materiel Command, 1 July 1992 - 13 July 2001 Further reading *Porter, \\"History of Sacramento Air Service Command\\" External links *Information on the center Logistics units and formations of the United States Air Force Military units and formations disestablished in the 2000s 1935 establishments in California History of Sacramento, California History of Sacramento County, California Military Superfund sites Buildings and structures in Sacramento County, California ","title":"Sacramento Air Logistics Center"},{"id":"42542063","text":"Bucculatrix frigida is a moth in the family Bucculatricidae.

Biography Adelia Field was born in East Rodman, New York on March 30, 1839. Her parents were Leighton Field and Sophia Field. She graduated from New York State Normal School in Albany in 1860. From 1883 to 1885, she studied medicine at the Medical College of Pennsylvania. Fielde also studied biology for two years at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, but did not receive a formal degree. At age 27, her fianc√© went to Thailand to engage in missionary work, and she followed, only to find he had passed several weeks before her arrival. She never married. In 1894, after the defeat of the women's suffrage amendment to the New York State constitution, Fielde was one of six prominent suffragists who founded the League for Political Education. She worked with other suffragists to establish the Volunteer Committee with the goal of targeting New York society, using her wealth and status she established as a missionary in China to facilitate her efforts. Key research contributions Fielde made significant contributions to myrmecology, the study of ants. In particular, she devised the 'Fielde Nest', a portable observation nest that she then used to enable precise observations of ant behaviour, and which was also used by others including William Morton Wheeler. She published over 20 papers about ants in less than 10 years. She carried out her myrmecological research at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, one of the few institutions that was sympathetic to female students at that time. In addition to studying there, she also gave lectures. Key discoveries include demonstrating that ants use their antennae to recognise nestmates and that ants react to vibrations in the ground detected via their legs, rather than 'hearing' sound travelling through the air.

He is a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for The New York Times.  Early life  Apuzzo was born in Cumberland, Maine and attended Colby College, where he edited the school newspaper, the Colby Echo.  Career  He wrote for the Waterville Morning Sentinel while in college. He then worked for The Standard-Times in New Bedford, Massachusetts before moving to the Associated Press. He reported on New York City Police Department corruption and misconduct and revealed its collaboration with the CIA to conduct surveillance in Muslim communities. He won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting with Adam Goldman, Eileen Sullivan and Chris Hawley. In 2013, Apuzzo co-wrote a book with Adam Goldman called Enemies Within. In 2013, it was revealed that the Justice Department secretly subpoenaed his phone records as part of a leak investigation into who provided the Associated Press information about a bomb plot foiled by the CIA. It was later revealed that the Justice Department had conducted leak investigations into his stories twice before. He has been highly critical of government secrecy and the media's willingness to accept it. Since 2013, he has worked for The New York Times and teaches journalism at Georgetown University. At the Times, Apuzzo broke several stories about the Justice Department's civil rights efforts and national security prosecutions. In January 2015, he broke the story about how the FBI and Justice Department were recommending that the former C.I.A. director David Petraeus be charged with a felony in connection with disclosing sensitive national security information. In April 2015, Apuzzo and his colleague Michael S. Schmidt revealed the video footage of a white police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, shooting an unarmed black man running away from him. In July 2015, a story by Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt about the Hillary Clinton email controversy drew criticism from Mrs. Clinton's campaign and her supporters, including from the Times public editor Margaret Sullivan. The Washington Post media columnist Erik Wemple in April 2017 cleared Apuzzo and Schmidt of wrongdoing in connection with story, saying if anything the Times had understated the severity of how seriously the government was investigating Mrs. Clinton. Apuzzo and two other Times reporters authored a series of stories in 2016 about how American torture policies in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, had led to long lasting mental health issues for those detainees tortured by Americans. The stories were one of the first accounts of the mental health toll created by American torture policies. He shared in the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for the newspaper's coverage of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. In June 2018, the Times announced Apuzzo had been appointed Investigative Correspondent in Brussels and would be moving from the Washington bureau to join the International Desk from August 2018.

Stasinowsky and Parashumti had known Mitchell for three days, and claimed they murdered her because they found her irritating. Murder Stacey Mitchell was born in Dorset, England, but emigrated to Australia at the age of 10. At the age of 16, she ran away from her family home and stayed with 19-year-old Parashumti and 21-year-old Stasinowsky. Parashumti was accused by Stasinowsky of flirting with Mitchell. She planned to kill Mitchell to prove to Stasinowsky she was not attracted to her. The three of them spent the evening drinking whisky before Parashumti hit Mitchell over the back of the head with a concrete block. Stasinowsky then strangled her with a dog chain. As she lay dying, the two women kissed over her body and filmed her on a mobile phone. Earlier attempts to kill Mitchell by Stasinowsky included putting broken glass in her drink and spilling oil on the bathroom floor. Trial The two women were tried at the Perth Supreme Court. During the trial they \\"smiled, giggled and whispered at each other\\". Parashumti's lawyer stated that she had a severe personality disorder and had grown up with an abusive father. She had also had an obsession with the vampire sub-culture, and a penchant for drinking people's blood since the age of 10. Parashumti's father had previously been in prison for beating his wife. Both women pleaded guilty, and revealed that after Mitchell's death, they had visited a hardware store to look for a chainsaw and some spades. In 2008, both women were sentenced to strict security life imprisonment, with a 24-year minimum term. Stasinowsky subsequently appealed her sentence. Her appeal was unanimously rejected by the WA Court of Appeal. David Ross John Haynes, who also lived with them, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for being an accessory. Although he had been fully aware of the plan to kill Mitchell, he agreed to go to his bedroom and listen to music. Imprisonment It was discovered in 2009 that the two women were continuing their relationship in prison, reportedly spending up to 90 minutes together on weekdays, and seven hours a day on weekends. Parashumti was consequently moved to a separate prison. They attempted to maintain contact by sending letters, using fellow inmate Catherine Birnie as a go-between. In 2012, three prison officers were injured following their intervention in a fight involving Parashumti and another inmate. In 2013 Parashumti attempted to escape from prison, but failed to leave the grounds. It was reported she would consequently face a police charge. Other charges In 2014, 20 charges against Stasinowsky, which pre- dated the murder, were dropped.

The majority of the buildings in the district were constructed soon after a fire destroyed the town in 1911; the architectural styles reflect common styles in commercial buildings around the Southern United States at the beginning of the 20th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and the boundaries of the district were increased in 2014. History In 1883, Fayette County's courthouse was located about one mile (1.6 km) from the current location of downtown Fayette. That year, the Georgia Pacific Railway line between Columbus, Mississippi, and Birmingham was extended through Fayette County. Merchants began to move along the line, and in 1892, a new courthouse was constructed in the town that had grown near the station. See also: The majority of the central business district, including the courthouse, were destroyed by a fire on March 24, 1911. As the town began to rebuild, the town council passed building codes requiring all downtown structures to be constructed of brick, stone, or concrete. Contributing structures The district contains 26 contributing properties, most of which were built soon after the fire of 1911. Most of the properties in the district face Temple Avenue, which runs north-to-south through downtown. The centerpiece is the Fayette County Courthouse, completed in 1912. The two- story, Neoclassical structure sits in the middle of a park with memorials and monuments scattered throughout. A tree-lined sidewalk leads from the street to the courthouse's portico, which features four Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment. The building is topped with a columned dome, the front face of which is adorned with a clock. At the south end of the district sits the Southern Railway depot, completed in 1913. The station is constructed of red brick and features a low hipped roof and bracketed eaves. Next to the station is the five-story William M. Cannon Wholesale Grocery Building, completed in 1928. The tallest building in Fayette, it was originally intended to serve as a hotel, but was built with a wooden structure rather than steel, failing to meet the city's building code. The courthouse and adjacent Fayette County Bank are the only buildings in the district designed in a Neoclassical style. The majority of other buildings represent the Early Commercial style, although some feature influences from Mediterranean and Asian architecture. All but two buildings were constructed of brick: the Old Post Office (completed 1911) is of stone and stucco, and the F.A. Nuckols Building (1912) is of concrete block.

It was first released on King's 1971 album Tapestry and then on the second single from that album, along with \\"So Far Away\\", charting at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was subsequently covered by many artists, most famously by Quincy Jones as the title song of his 1971 album Smackwater Jack. Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau described \\"Smackwater Jack\\" as an \\"uptempo shuffle\\". Its lyrics tell the story of a confrontation between the outlaw Smackwater Jack and Big Jim the Chief. In this way it differs from the other songs on Tapestry, which are more personal and based on expressing emotions. Billboard ranked both sides of the \\"So Far Away\\"/\\"Smackwater Jack\\" single together on the Billboard Hot 100. The single peaked at number 14. Critical reception Author James Perone claims that the song still fits into the album by being the one song on which King's piano blends in with the other instruments on the song. Perone regards Danny Kortchmar's electric guitar and Ralph Schuckett's electric piano as the most prominent instruments on the song, but Landau showers most praise on Charlie Larkey's bass guitar and Joel O'Brien's drums. Landau regards \\"Smackwater Jack\\" as a good example of the effectiveness of Goffin's and King's songwriting partnership. He regards Goffin as providing \\"brilliant and far-ranging\\" lyrics, while King \\"is subtly embellishing the musical form itself\\". AllMusic critic Stewart Mason agrees that the song has \\"dry wit and several clever lines\\". Mason described the song as a \\"fan- favorite\\", but also regards it as a \\"rather lightweight song\\".

Marguerite Lundgren was born to a Swedish father and English mother and during her childhood lived both in Sweden and England, being fluent in both languages. Through an aunt, who was one of the founders of the Wynstones School in Gloucestershire, she was able to attend the Michael Hall school, then in South London. This stimulated her interest in eurythmy, which she went on to study with Lieselotte Mann in England. In 1946, after completing her training, she joined the stage group at the. Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, where her originality and talent were quickly spotted by the troupe leader, Marie Savitch. This led to a lifelong bond and common research between the two women.Marguerite Lundgren - Biographischer Eintrag in der Online-Dokumentation der anthroposophischen Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls In 1948, she was asked to return to England to take over the eurythmy school of Vera and Judy Compton-Burnett, where she came to know and work closely with Owen Barfield and Cecil Harwood, whom she married in 1953.Owen Barfield: Romanticism Comes of Age ‚Äì a Biography by Simon Blaxland De Lange, Temple Lodge Pub 2006 ‚Ä¢ Page 293 - 296 Their cooperation led to her fundamental research in creating a eurythmic form specifically for the English language. For many years she taught and performed with the London School of Eurythmy, which she directed, and the London Stage Group. The work took her regularly to Scandinavia, North America and South Africa, where she did much to assist the development of eurythmy. The last years of her life brought with them the death of her husband, Cecil Harwood, from which she never quite recovered, and the move of her eurythmy school from London to East Grinstead in Sussex, close to where they had lived for many years. She died in August 1983. The book Eurythmy and the Impulse of Dance written together with Cecil Harwood and Marjorie Raff√©, records her research into the principles of eurythmy in English.

As the religious leader responsible for the popularization of Zionist Christianity into Zimbabwe, he is arguably the most influential religious personality in the country's history.  Early Years and Religious Calling  Mutendi was born in the Bikita region of Zimbabwe, apparently to a family descended from the Rozvi royal line.B. Sundkler and C. Steed, A History of the Church in Africa. London: Cambridge University Press, 2000, 813. Before the late 1920s he went by his birth name of Samuel Moyo, but later changed it to Mutendi as his stature as a leader was increasing. According to autobiographical sections of his sacred writings, Rungano Rwa Zion Christian Church,The Rungano has never been published, but circulates primarily in xeroxed format in the Shona language. The only translated parts may be found in M L Daneel. Old and New in Southern Shona Independent Churches. The Hague: Mouton, 1972, Vol 1, 483-91. . Mutendi was born prematurely and was expected to die. The name \\"Mutendi\\" is a shortened colloquial reference to his eyes opening after being left for dead by his family members.V Chimininge, \\"The Zion Christian Church: A Case Study,\\" in E.

He was taught to read and write by a male relative. In his early adulthood he took a job with the British South Africa Police and was stationed at Chegutu.Daneel. Old and New in Southern Shona Independent Churches, Vol 1, 390-1. According to the Rungano, Mutendi was visited by the Angel Gabriel in 1913 at a time when he was not religious. Further visions, especially after 1919, encouraged him to seek a religious path and foretold his rise as a religious leader. In the early 1920s Mutendi quit his police job and returned to Bikita, where he joined the local Dutch Reformed Church mission. Mutendi felt compelled to preach as a layman, but his accounts of his visions and his calls for converts to experience \\"fire baptism\\" were unacceptable in the conservative DRC.Anderson. African Reformation 115. During this time, three acquaintances of Mutendi's ventured to South Africa as migrant workers, and were converted to Zionist Christianity in the Transvaal. Mutendi then heard of his friends' experiences, and went to South Africa himself with a colleague named Andreas Shoko.H. Bucher, Spirit and Power: An Analysis of Shona Cosmology. London: Oxford University Press, 1980, 132-3. During their time in the Transvaal, Mutendi and Shoko were baptized by Engenas Lekganyane.Daneel. Old and New in Southern Shona Independent Churches, Vol 1, 391-6. Around 1923, Mutendi returned to Bikita as a ZCC member and began preaching. In early 1925 was part of a delegation that unsuccessfully sought to register the church with the South African government.B. Morton, \\"Engenas Lekganyane and the Early ZCC: Oral Texts and Documents,\\" 6. https://www.academia.edu/14338013/Engenas_Lekganyane_and_the_Early_ZCC_Oral_Texts_and_Documents Following the secession, Mutendi led the Zimbabwean branch of the ZCC until his death fifty years later. Although Mutendi's biography is well known, it has recently been questioned as new documentation has come to light. In particular, it appears that he was never a member of the Zion Apostolic Faith Mission before he joined the ZCC as he claimed. As a result of this and other disparities, his life story is not clear- cut.https://www.academia.edu/26700853/Samuel_Mutendis_Biography_Cannot_Be_True  The Growth of the Zion Christian Church in Zimbabwe  Mutendi's new church faced considerable difficulties in its first decade or two. Due to the system of indirect rule, it was opposed by both the White authorities and the chiefs who they ruled the reserves through.B. Davis and W. Dopcke, \\"Survival and Accumulation in Gutu: Class Formation and the Rise of the State in Colonial Zimbabwe,\\" Journal of Southern African Studies 14, 1 (1987): 72-5. Mutendi was unable to register the church in his own country, and faced considerable persecution during his evangelizing tours. According to the Rungano, many of his adherents' churches and schools were burned down, while he was arrested and imprisoned on numerous occasions.\\"Bishop Mutendi: Millionaire Who Keeps a Low Profile.\\" Nehanda Radio 11 October 2015. http://nehandaradio.com/2015/10/11/bishop-mutendi-millionaire-who-keeps-low- profile/ In some areas his followers were forced to conduct their services in secret in places such as caves. Over time Mutendi's reputation as a faith healer, rain maker, and a man of immense spiritual power grew. He walked around with a large entourage that proclaimed his deeds. During his itinerant tours, Mutendi carried a \\"spriritual rod\\" named \\"Mapumhangozi\\" that was supposedly blessed by Engenas Lekganyane.\\"President Mugabe to Open ZCC Centre.\\" The Herald 19 April 2011. http://www.herald.co.zw/president-mugabe- to-open-zcc-centre/ This rod was used to heal the sick and to effectuate other miracles. Due to these successes Mutendi was able to win the support of a number of chiefs and thus to begin operating more in the open without fear of arrest. Eventually, after years of suppression, the government issued what Mutendi called a \\"Peace Order\\".Daneel, Old and New, Vol 1, 425. People with illnesses or other issues began to venture from far and wide to seek his counsel and intervention.M.L. Daneel, Zionism and Faith Healing in Rhodesia: Aspects of African Independent Churches. The Hague: Mouton, 1970, 24-7. https://open.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/8946/daneel_rhodesia_web.pdf?sequence=1 After the nearly simultaneous death of Engenas Lekganyane and the beginning of apartheid in South Africa, Mutendi's branch of the ZCC became increasingly distinct from the main South African branch. Prior to 1948 Zimbabweans could travel freely to South Africa to visit the ZCC's two annual pilgrimages. The apartheid government's new travel requirements rendered these pilgrimages, as well as other contacts, far more difficult. Another bone of contention was that Mutendi did not condone ancestor worship, as did the parent South African church. In the early 1950s Mutendi built his own \\"Zion City\\" near Bikita and erected his headquarters there. This site became the new pilgrimage site for Zimbabwean ZCC members. As a result of the new reality, Mutendi wrote his sacred text, the Rungano Rwa Zion Christian Church, which included a new constitution that made it distinct from the Lekganyane ZCC.Daneel, Old and New, Vol. 1, 425-7. Mutendi also began to mandate the use of different sorts of sacred clothing by his members. Over the decades, Mutendi's organization continued to grow and evolved into Zimbabwe's largest church. Mutendi's Death and the Modern Zimbabwean ZCC  Mutendi had a large family, and two of his sons, Ruben and Nehemiah, vied for the leadership of the ZCC following his death in 1976. Nehemiah Mutendi (1939) was eventually appointed as the new Bishop of the ZCC after an internal power struggle in 1976.\\"Bishop Mutendi: Millionaire Who Keeps a Low Profile.\\" Nehanda Radio 11 October 2015. http://nehandaradio.com/2015/10/11/bishop-mutendi-millionaire-who-keeps-low- profile/ Under his control the ZCC grew and since then has spread rapidly across the world following the post-2000 Zimbabwean diaspora.http://\\"Dream Comes True for ZCC Followers,\\" The Standard 7 August 2011. http://www.thestandard.co.zw/2011/08/07/dream-comes-true-for-zcc-followers/ Ruben Mutendi Makuwa (1934-2010) eventually split from the ZCC to create Zion Christian Church Mandadzaka, headquartered in Bikita in the Masvingo Province.

At its conception in 2000, Teatro 8 provided the only sit-down entertainment on Calle Ocho, bringing in crowds from all over the world to Little Havana for a small taste of Cuban culture. Since then, the theater has put on more than 250 productions for audiences of all ages, nationalities, religions, and socioeconomic statuses. Teatro 8 prides itself in being able to offer low-cost tickets in order to make Latinx theatre accessible to all who want to enjoy it. Ticket prices range from $10, $15, $35, and, at most, $80. The theater features Spanish-language productions spanning all genres, from musicals to comedies to ballets and dance performances.

History James Weldon Johnson in 1932 James Weldon Johnson Community Library is named after James Weldon Johnson, native Floridian author, educator, civil rights activist, head of the NAACP. His song \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" is considered by many to be the \\"Negro National Anthem.\\" The history of James Weldon Johnson Community Library is part of African American history in St. Petersburg. Andrew Carnegie intended for the library he funded in St. Petersburg to be racially integrated when it opened in 1915, but the city refused black residents access to the library. In 1944, the city began allowing blacks into only the basement of the Carnegie library. Mrs. S.M. Carter, wife of a pastor, formed an interracial committee and lobbied the city for funds to open a black library.Hartzell, S. (2006). Remembering St. Petersburg, Florida: Sunshine City Stories. The History Press, Charleston SC. On April 1, 1947 the James Weldon Johnson Library opened in a leased space on 1035 Third Ave. S. The original location was a 1,025 square foot room on the ground floor of the Masonic Lodge. It served the community at the Third Avenue location until 1979, when it was closed because of the city‚Äôs urban redevelopment project, which displaced hundreds of black residents from the Gas Plant area. In 1981, the James Weldon Branch reopened in the newly built Enoch Davis Center at 1111 18th Ave. S. Of the city‚Äôs five public libraries, the Johnson branch was the only one housed within the confines of another building. In 1990, there were rumors that the library was going to be closed due to funding cuts.Ed.(1990, April 13). City cutbacks would hit blacks hard Series: EDITORIALS. St. Petersburg Times, pp. 22-A.

The 70th Guards took part in heavy combat as part of 13th Army on the north flank of the Kursk salient in July 1943, helping to fight the German 9th Army to a standstill before going over to the counteroffensive. It earned a battle honor in the campaign to liberate the Oryol salient before advancing west toward the Dniepr, winning a second Order of the Red Banner in the process. After crossing that river it took part in the campaigns to liberate Kiev and then to hold the city during November. It was briefly assigned to 38th Army, then back to the 13th, before rejoining 38th Army for the duration of the war. It continued to see service through the northwest of Ukraine into the autumn of 1944 as it and its regiments received further battle honors and decorations, particularly as a result of the liberation of Lvov. In November it was reassigned with its Army to the 4th Ukrainian Front and spent the rest of the war battling through the Carpathian mountains, eventually participating in the advance on Prague in May, 1945. In the process the division became one of the most decorated formations of the Red Army. The 70th Guards later became part of the Soviet Army as a motor rifle division and took part in the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. The division was finally disbanded in 1991.  Formation  The 70th Guards was one of several Guards rifle divisions created in the aftermath of the fighting for Stalingrad, on February 7, 1943. It was formed from the remnants of the 138th Rifle Division, in recognition of that division's stalwart defense against the German 6th Army in the Battle of Stalingrad, in particular the Barrikady Ordnance Factory. When formed, its order of battle was as follows: * 203rd Guards Rifle Regiment from 344th Rifle Regiment * 205th Guards Rifle Regiment from 650th Rifle Regiment * 207th Guards Rifle Regiment from 768th Rifle Regiment * 137th Guards Artillery Regiment from 295th Artillery Regiment * 74th Guards Antitank Battalion from 230th Antitank BattalionCharles C.

In addition, on February 22, while it was still officially the 344th Rifle Regiment, the 203rd Guards was awarded the same Order for its service at Stalingrad. Ivan Ilich Lyudnikov, who had been promoted to the rank of major general on January 27, remained in command. In the reallocation of the Soviet forces around Stalingrad the division was soon moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding.David M.

Note location of Olkhovatka (Olchowatka) on the 13th Army sector.In the course of the battle the 70th Guards would defend part of the Olkhovatka sector. 13th Army, along with reinforcements, occupied the most important sector of Rokossovskii's front, about 32km in width, bordered on the right by 48th Army and by 70th Army on the left. The Army had four of its rifle divisions (8th, 15th, 81st and 148th) in its first echelon, two in second echelon, and the 17th and 18th Guards Rifle Corps in reserve.

At this time both the 13th and 60th Armies were fighting along the right (west) bank of the Dniepr.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, p. 57  Battle of the Dniepr  The Front commander, Army Gen. N. F. Vatutin, was planning a new offensive involving these two armies against the German Kiev group of forces. As part of this plan the 17th Guards Corps (6th and 70th Guards Divisions) was transferred back to 60th Army effective at midnight October 6. During that day and the next the Army was to clear the south bank of the Uzh River before seizing a bridgehead over the Teteriv River. At this time the division had 4,534 personnel on strength, equipped with five 76.2mm regimental guns, 41 medium and heavy mortars, plus 13 76.2mm cannon and eight 122mm howitzers in the 137th Guards Artillery Regiment. In the event this offensive became tied down by German counterattacks until noon on October 11. The 17th and 18th Guards Corps did not have any success but Vatutin insisted that the assault be renewed at noon on October 14 with the intention of linking the bridgeheads held by the two armies to prepare for an advance on Kiev. This attack, and a further effort the next day, made only minor gains which were counterbalanced by German gains on other sectors. The offensive was shut down temporarily on October 17.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr pp. 57-59, 67-69, 192-93 =Battles for Kiev= During October 18-23 the 60th Army was engaged in intensive fighting as German forces repeatedly counterattacked along the south bank of the Teteriv. Fending off these attacks expended a great deal of ammunition which forced a postponement of a new Soviet offensive until after October 23. In the plan for this offensive the 60th Army would attack toward Rovy with nine rifle divisions, including the 70th Guards, before driving south along the left bank of the Irpin River in the direction of Kiev. 17th Guards Corps was on the right flank of the Army on a 12km-wide sector.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr pp. 70, 90, 93 At 0800 hours on November 3 the 60th and 38th Armies began their artillery preparations and their infantry and direct-support tanks began to advance at 0840. Despite heavy German fire and counterattacks a breakthrough was made by the shock groups and both armies advanced 5-12km during the day. The 17th Guards Corps was mostly engaged in local fighting to improve its positions. Throughout the day Vatutin insistently demanded that 60th Army increase the pace of its attack since the success of 38th Army's operations on the Kiev axis were dependent on the former's advance. Despite this the 70th Guards was not engaged in active operations until after it was removed overnight on November 5/6 from 17th Guards Corps to reinforce the Army's left wing. By this time the 38th Army was fighting within central Kiev, which was liberated early in the morning of November 6; on the same day the left wing of 60th Army advanced 12km.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr pp. 111, 113, 115-17 Vatutin ordered the offensive to continue into western Ukraine with 60th Army directed to take bridgeheads over the Teteriv in the area of Radomyshl by the end of November 9. The 70th Guards returned to 17th Guards Corps where it joined the 211th Rifle Division; the Corps was held in the Army's second echelon. On November 11 the Army cleared the Teteriv along its entire front, advanced from 10-25km and captured 200 prisoners and large amounts of equipment. During the next day the Corps moved to the south of the Army's main axis and by the day's end had reached 38th Army's sector in the Stavetskaya Sloboda area; by now that Army was approaching Zhytomyr. Throughout the advancing Soviet forces divisional artillery was falling behind, ammunition was in short supply, and 38th Army was starting to face counterattacks from panzer forces. During the evening the STAVKA ordered Vatutin to cease the advance and consolidate the liberated area. As part of this order the 17th Guards Corps was transferred to 38th Army. At this time the 70th Guards had 3,793 personnel on strength.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr pp. 123-26, 134-35, 137-38, 225 Kiev Strategic Defensive Operation During the rest of November the 1st Ukrainian Front was on the defensive, under attack by the 4th Panzer Army. In the morning of November 15 the division was organizing a defense along a line from outside Gnilets to Lisovka to Turbovka. This line was incomplete when it was struck by the 1st Panzer and 1st SS Panzer Divisions. In heavy fighting throughout the day against 38th Army the German forces managed to capture Solovyovka and drive the 17th Guards Corps to the north. The next day the two German divisions continued to attempt to break through to Brusyliv but were only able to reach Divin by the end of the day, forcing the 70th Guards to fall back to the village of Vilshka. This retreat allowed the division to link up with the 7th Guards Tank Corps. Despite heavy resistance on November 17 the panzers were able to reach the paved road from Kiev to Zhytomyr, threatening to envelop the Soviet forces there. 38th Army continued to reorganize the following day and the 17th Guards Corps, which now included the 75th Guards Division, was engaged in defensive fighting along a front from Tsarevka to Privorotye to Morozovka. Overnight General Vatutin issued orders to the Army to launch a counteroffensive on November 21. During these few days of combat the division had been reduced to 2,768 personnel.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr pp. 144, 147-52, 228 During November 19 the momentum of 4th Panzer Army began to decline, although 17th Guards Corps was forced to abandon Morozovka. After regrouping the panzer forces focused on encircling 38th Army's Brusyliv group of forces and although the town was taken on November 23 and Vatutin's planned counterstroke was suspended the encirclement was not successful. Fighting continued through November 25-29 but both sides were by now effectively played out.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr pp. 152-56 During the regroupings that took place during this week the 70th Guards was reassigned to the 52nd Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 306 Into Western Ukraine During December the 70th Guards returned to 13th Army, now as part of the 28th Rifle Corps. In January, 1944 it was moved back to 38th Army where it joined the 101st Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 15, 44 Apart from one brief reassignment the division would remain under these commands for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 73 In March the 1st Ukrainian Front launched its part of the Proskurov-Chernivtsi Offensive and in the course of this the division took part in the liberation of Vinnytsia, for which it was awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree, on March 23. On April 29 General Gusev handed his command to Col. Timofei Andronikovich Andrienko. =Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive= After directing the division's fighting along the Dniestr River during the spring Colonel Andrienko handed his command back to General Gusev on July 4. In the planning for the Lvov- Sandomierz operation in July the 38th Army was to penetrate the German defense in the Bzovitsa and Bogdanovka sector on a width of 6km. It would then develop the offensive with seven divisions in the direction of Peremyshliany with the objective of encircling the German Lvov grouping in cooperation with the 4th Tank and 60th Armies.Glantz and Harold S.

Into the Carpathians During September it was noted that the personnel of the 70th Guards were about 50 percent Russian (from year groups 1894-1927, a very wide age range) and about 50 percent of various Asian nationalities.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 596 Over that month and the next the division took part in the East Carpathian Offensive, particularly in the area of the Dukla Pass. In October it was transferred to the 76th Rifle Corps but returned to the 101st Corps in November when 38th Army was itself transferred to 4th Ukrainian Front, where it would remain for the duration of the war.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 318, 353 Fighting died down until the start of the Western Carpathian Offensive on January 12, 1945. 38th Army attacked following a heavy artillery preparation with the 101st and 67th Rifle Corps and by January 15 had broken through the XI SS Army Corps and began advancing westward. The next day the 205th Regiment was awarded an honorific:In addition, on February 19 the 203rd Guards Regiment would be decorated with the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree (an unusual award for a regiment) while the 207th Guards Regiment would receive the Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree. Due to being wounded for the fourth time General Gusev was forced to hand his command to Maj. Gen. Dmitrii Yakovlevich Grigorev on February 25 but this staff officer was in turn replaced on March 10 by Col. Leonid Ivanovich Gredinarenko, who would remain in this post for the duration. The Moravia‚ÄìOstrava Offensive began the same day and during the course of the operation the 70th Guards was rewarded for its part in the capture of Bielsko with the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, on April 5. The division ended the war near Prague. Its full title at this time was 70th Guards Rifle, Glukhov, Order of Lenin, twice Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov, Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Division.

On May 28, in recognition of their roles in the liberation of Opava, the 205th Guards Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky, while the 99th Guards Signal Battalion received the Order of the Red Star. On the same date the following were decorated for their parts in the fighting for Ostrava and ≈Ωilina: 203rd and 205th Guards Rifle Regiments (Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree); 207th Guards Rifle Regiment (Order of Alexander Nevsky); 74th Guards Antitank Battalion (Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 3rd Degree). In a final round of awards on June 4 the division as a whole received the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd Degree, for its part in the liberation of Bohum√≠n and nearby towns, while the 77th Guards Sapper Battalion was given the same Order in the 3rd Degree, the 207th Guards Regiment won the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree, and the 203rd Guards Regiment was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky, all for the battle for Olomouc. The division was withdrawn with its corps to the Carpathian Military District and was based at Stanislav (later Ivano- Frankivsk) postwar. After the 101st Rifle Corps was disbanded the division became part of the 35th Guards Rifle Corps. The 70th Guards Rifle Division was attached to the 8th Tank Army during Operation Whirlwind in November 1956. The 70th Guards Rifle was redesignated the 70th Guards Motor Rifle Division on 25 June 1957 and directly subordinated to the 38th Army. The 207th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, 104th Guards Tank Regiment, the 137th Guards Artillery Regiment, and the 1159th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment were at Kolomyia. The 203rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment was at Nadvirna, and the 205th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment was at Ivano-Frankivsk. In January 1991 the division became the 857th Military Equipment Storage Base,Feskov et al 2013, pp. 474475 and in the next month was taken over by Ukraine.

History  Saint Henry's Way was born as a result of the canonization of Bishop Henry who was allegedly murdered in the ice of Lake K√∂yli√∂ in the winter of 1156. The original Medieval route started from the Kirkkokari island in K√∂yli√∂, the site of Henry's murder, and ended at his burial site, the Nousiainen Church. The route was later expanded to a total length of 140 kilometres, leading from Turku Cathedral to the St. Henry's Chapel in Kokem√§ki. The first pilgrimages were made in the 13th century.  The route  Saint Henry's Way consists of three sections. The first two are \\"Nunnapolku\\" (the Nun's Path) from Turku to Nousiainen and \\"Sant Henrikin tie\\" (St. Henry's Road) between Nousiainen and K√∂yli√∂. The last part from K√∂yli√∂ to Kokem√§ki follows the tracks of historical Huovintie road, which dates back to the 9th century. The Nun's Path begins from the Turku Cathedral and travels via Koroinen to Nousiainen Church. The second part leads mostly through the inhabited marsh and forest areas which are located between the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta. After joining the Huovintie road in S√§kyl√§, Saint Henry's Way travels along the Lake K√∂yli√∂ finally ending at Kokem√§ki.Pyh√§n Henrikin tie (in Finnish). Retrieved 21 April 2014.  Present pilgrimages  Today the Saint Henry's Way is a marked path for hikers and cyclists. The Catholic Church in Finland organizes an annual pilgrimage from Turku to K√∂yli√∂. It ends on a Mass held in the Kirkkokari island on the last pre-Midsummer Sunday. An ecumenical pilgrimage is organized every three years between Turku and Kokem√§ki. It was last arranged in June 2012.Pyhiinvaelluksia Suomessa (in Finnish). Retrieved 21 April 2014.

While in Hawaii, McIntosh studied and learned to speak Japanese. McIntosh was near the attack on Pearl Harbor while working as a correspondent for the Scripps Howard news service. She then returned to the Washington, D.C. area once World War II had begun in order to cover Eleanor Roosevelt and other government activities.  Work in the OSS  In January 1943, she was asked to join the Office of Strategic Services because she had become fluent in Japanese. She was then sent to India where her main job was to intervene in the postcard communication that troops would send home to India while stationed in Japan. She became one of the few women assigned to Morale Operations, along with future chef Julia Child who she befriend, where she created \\"disinformation,\\" or fake reports, documents and postcards, which would \\"undermine Japanese morale.\\" During her career for the OSS, McIntosh delivered an explosive masquerading as a lump of coal ‚Äì the device was dubbed \\"black Joe\\" ‚Äì to a Chinese operative of the OSS. The agent took the dynamite aboard a train ferrying Japanese soldiers and waited for the opportune moment to toss it into the engine before jumping to safety. The train blew up as it crossed a bridge. Recounting the story in 2011, she confessed to some initial guilt over the many deaths. But she quickly reconsidered, saying about the TNT, \\"I was just the one who handed it to the guy who did the job.\\"  Later life  McIntosh went on to work for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Voice of America, the State Department, and the United Nations.

Its southern terminus is at the Hinds‚ÄìCopiah county line. The route travels north to Terry, and turns west. MS 473 enters Terry, and ends at Interstate 55 (I-55) and U.S. Route 51 (US 51). The route was designated in 1957, from MS 27 to US 51. MS 473 was removed from the state highway system in 1967. It was restored into the system in 1995, from the county line to I-55/US 51. Route description All of the route is a paved road, located inside Hinds County. MS 473 is not included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. MS 473 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3. In 2012, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 5,300 vehicles traveling east of I-55/US 51, and as few as 1,300 vehicles traveling north of the Hinds‚ÄìCopiah county line. MS 473 is maintained by Mississippi Department of Transportation for , and Terry for . MS 473 starts at the Hinds‚ÄìCopiah county and travels north. It passes nearby ponds and intersects various dirt roads. About later, MS 473 intersects Moncure Road and continues north. At Bozeman Road, the route turns northeast, passing through a small forest. The road then turns north and passes over Vaughn Creek. MS 473 intersects Rosemary Road as it turned northwest, and soon travels west near Gaines Drive and Shady Oaks Road. The route enters Terry and crossed over a railroad, owned by Canadian National and Illinois Central. The route turns northwest, and enters downtown Terry. MS 473 leaves downtown Terry, and intersects a frontage road of I-55. The route ends at I-55 at a diamond interchange, and the road continues west as Green Gable Road. History MS 473 was designated in 1957, as a gravel road connecting from MS 27 to US 51. The next year, the section in Hinds County was paved. By 1960, MS 473 in Copiah County was transferred to local maintenance. Two years later, US 51 was realigned to I-55, and MS 473's northern terminus remained on old US 51's alignment. MS 473 was temporarily removed from the state highway system in 1967, and an interchange with I-55/US 51 was built near Terry in the same year. In 1974, the route's old alignment in Copiah County became paved. By 1995, MS 473 in Hinds County was restored in the state highway system, and was also extended to I-55/US 51.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for St. Catharines, Ontario. After the war she was re-purposed as a weather ship for use by the Department of Transport of Canada. St. Catharines was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 2 May 1942 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 5 December later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 31 July 1943 at Esquimalt. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia, St. Catharines was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force group C-2 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort in November 1943. Beginning in February 1944, she was made Senior Officer's Ship of the group, that title being retained until September of that year. On 6 March 1944, St. Catharines, along with the corvettes and , and destroyers , and , took part in the assault on . The attack on the U-boat took over thirty hours and only then was U-744 driven to the surface. Attempts to tow the submarine was made, however they failed and Icarus torpedoed and sank the abandoned submarine. It must be said that not all the ships attacked the submarine at the same time as Gatineau and Kenilworth Castle both had to leave the fight after developing mechanical defects. In October 1944 St. Catharines returned to Canada to undergo a refit at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. This lasted until December 1944. After working up in Bermuda, she returned only to begin a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant installing water-cooling and refrigeration abilities and changing the camouflage pattern. The refit was completed in August 1945, however Japan had surrendered and she was paid off on 18 November 1945 and laid up. Postwar service St. Catharines was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. in 1947. In 1950 Canada became responsible for operating weather ship P (Peter) in the Northern Pacific Ocean. As a result, the Government of Canada re-acquired St. Catharines and her sister ship and sent them for conversion to weather ships at Sorel, Quebec. They were repainted with black hulls and white superstructures and buff funnels with black tops, and sent out to the position of weather ship P as CGS St. Catharines and CGS Stone Town respectively. Once at that position they were to provide positional information for long range, propeller flights over the Pacific and weather forecasting and measurement of winds aloft. In 1962, she was transferred to the newly formed Canadian Coast Guard and repainted in their colours. She remained at this post until 1967 when she was relieved by CGS Vancouver. She was broken up in Japan in 1968. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John. The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910‚Äì1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships.

Established by ethnic Chinese businessmen Ang Hock Liem and Tjoa Ma Tjoen in 1940, it produced seven black-and-white films before it was dissolved in 1942; all are thought to be lost. The company's films were directed by four men, mostly ethnic Chinese, and launched the careers of actors such as Rendra Karno and Djoewariah. Established during the revival of the Indies film industry, Union released its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by Saeroen which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted to distance themselves from the theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s. History Following the commercial successes of Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937), Fatima (1938), and Alang-Alang (Grass; 1939), the film industry of the Dutch East Indies ‚Äì which had been severely weakened by the Great Depression ‚Äì was revived. Film production increased and, in 1940, four new production houses were opened, including Union Films. The company was funded by ethnic Chinese businessman Ang Hock Liem, who is credited as producer for the majority of the company's releases; daily operations, however, were handled by Tjoa Ma Tjoen. Union was headquartered in Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta), and, according to a press release, established to \\"improve the quality of Indonesian art\\". A Dutch-language advertisement for Union's first film, Kedok Ketawa (1940) The fledgling Union's first film, Kedok Ketawa, was released in July 1940. Following a young couple who face off against criminals with the help of a masked bandit, this film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. It received positive reviews; the journalist Saeroen wrote in Pemandangan that the film's quality was comparable to imported Hollywood productions, and a review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised the cinematography. Following these positive reviews, Union hired Saeroen ‚Äì who had previously written Terang Boelan and several works for Tan's Film ‚Äì as a screenwriter. He made his debut for the company with Harta Berdarah, directed by new hires R Hu and Rd Ariffien, following Jo An Djan's departure for Populair's Film. The film, in which a young man convinces a miserly hajji to be more charitable, was released in October 1940 and starred the singer Soelastri and martial artist Zonder. Union released their third production, Bajar dengan Djiwa, by February 1941. Directed by R Hu, this film ‚Äì a drama in which a young woman is sold to a loan shark in order to pay her father's debt ‚Äì marked the film debut of Djoewariah; she later became Union's leading lady. Ariffien, meanwhile, was tasked with directing Asmara Moerni, based on a script by Saeroen. Attempting to reach the educated audiences by casting a young doctor, Adnan Kapau Gani, opposite Djoewariah, this romance told of a young man who is ultimately able to marry his former maid after she receives an education. Released in April, the film received mixed reviews: one, in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad, found the film \\"fascinating\\", while another for the same paper considered the film dependent on the stage traditions which its advertisements had denounced. In July 1941 Union released Wanita dan Satria, a Djoewariah vehicle which follows a well- born womaniser who abuses his social status to gain women's trust before ultimately getting his comeuppance.; In advertising Wanita dan Satria, the company again emphasised the non-theatrical background of the film's cast, which also included Moesa, Djoewita and Hidajat. The film received positive reviews; one, from the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, wrote that Wanita dan Satria \\"gives a clear picture of the precarious position of Indonesian women and motivates the desire for a firmer outline of her rights in the Moslem society\\". This was the company's last film to be directed by Ariffien or written by Saeroen; both men migrated to rival company Star Film soon afterwards. Advertisement for Union's last production, Mega Mendoeng (1942) Hu remained with Union and directed the company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete for the love of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942.; In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences. By the end of 1941, the government of the Dutch East Indies were concerned that Empire of Japan could invade the colony. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of the film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Union, though already beginning production of a film set in the Majapahit era titled Damar Woelan, was forced to stop filming. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, Union was closed, never to reopen. Aside from Ariffien, who continued directing into the 1960s, none of Union's directors or producers returned to the film industry after the conclusion of the Japanese occupation in 1945. Several actors continued their careers. Djoewariah, for instance, made her first film after leaving Union, Sehidup Semati (One Life, One Death), in 1949, and continued acting until the mid-1950s. Soekarno's career lasted through the 1970s; he was mostly credited as Rendra Karno after changing his name in the 1950s. Others had careers behind the screen; Kedok Ketawa star Basoeki Resobowo, for instance, became art director on films such as Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950). Filmography In a period of two years, Union released seven films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Several were screened in nearby Singapore, including Bajar dengan Djiwa and Asmara Moerni. Though its films were screened at least into the 1940s, the company's output is likely lost. *Kedok Ketawa (Laughing Mask; 1940) *Harta Berdarah (Bloody Treasure; 1940) *Bajar dengan Djiwa (Pay with [One's] Soul; 1941) *Asmara Moerni (True Love; 1941) *Wanita dan Satria (The Woman and the Hero; 1941) *Soeara Berbisa (Venomous Voice; 1941) *Mega Mendoeng (1942) See also *List of lost films Explanatory notes References Works cited         (book acquired from the collection of Museum Tamansiswa Dewantara Kirti Griya, Yogyakarta)      * 1940 establishments in the Dutch East Indies 1942 disestablishments in the Dutch East Indies Mass media companies established in 1940 Mass media companies disestablished in 1942 Film production companies of the Dutch East Indies Defunct companies of the Dutch East Indies ","title":"Union Films"},{"id":"42542978","text":"Zhang Juyong (ÂºµÂ±ÖË©†), formally Duke Yi of Qinghe (Ê∏ÖÊ≤≥ÊáøÂÖ¨), was a chancellor of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Southern Tang and possibly its predecessor state Wu.

The NESSI instrument was mounted in 2014 on a 2.4 meter telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in Socorro County, New Mexico, USA, achieving first light on 7 April 2014. Overview NESSI, a $3.5 million instrument, is the first purpose-built device for the analysis of exoplanet atmospheres, and is expected to have a powerful impact on the field of exoplanet characterization. The Principal Investigator is Michele Creech- Eakman at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, working with seven co-investigators from New Mexico Tech, Magdalena Ridge Observatory, and NASA JPL. It is partly funded by NASA's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, in partnership with the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. The NESSI spectroscope was mounted on the institute's 2.4 meter telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in Socorro County, New Mexico, USA, and its first exoplanet observations began on April 7, 2014. NESSI will capture the spectra of both the star and the planet during the transit and then allow scientists to deduct the composition of the planet's atmosphere. The novel technology is expected to achieve high definition readings by using algorithms to calibrate and compensate for time-variable telluric features and instrumental variability throughout an observation. Scientific goals NESSI will be able to detect and study a wide range of wavelengths in the near-infrared region of the light spectrum. NESSI will be used to study about 100 exoplanets, ranging from massive 'super-Earths' to gas giants. It uses a technique called transit spectroscopy, in which a planet is observed as it crosses in front of, then behind, its parent star. The observed light is beamed through a spectrometer that breaks it apart, ultimately revealing chemicals that make up the planet's atmosphere. NESSI is expected to devote about 50 nights per year for surveying exoplanets via infrared spectroscopy.

It is located on the Saint-Maurice River about north of the city of La Tuque, in Quebec, in Canada. Built between 1930 and 1934 by the Shawinigan Water & Power Company (SWPC), it is the third hydroelectric facility on this river (from the source of the river). The plant has been operated by Hydro-Qu√©bec since it was acquired from the SWPC in 1963, as part of the nationalisation of electric power companies in Quebec. The plant has a rated power of .  History  ‚ÄúRapide-Blanc‚Äù (English: White Rapid) was deemed to be the most dangerous rapids of Saint-Maurice River. The Atikamekw preferred to use a series of 11 portages from Coucoucache to the mouth of the Vermillon River (La Tuque), upstream of La Trenche Generating Station, through the Coucoucache Creek. This hydroelectric dam was built on the site of the former \\"Rapide Blanc\\" whose designation goes back to at at least the mid-nineteenth century. After the construction of the dam, only one of the old rapids remains (downstream of the dam), designated in French \\"Rapides de la T√™te du Rapide Blanc\\" (Rapids of the Head of White Rapids). The name \\"Rapide-Blanc\\" (White Rapid) was also given to the rail stop located 12 km south of the village.\\"Names and places of Qu√©bec\\", the work of the Geographical Names Board published in 1994 and 1996 as an illustrated dictionary printed, and in that of a CD produced by Micro-Intel in 1997 from this dictionary. In 1928, the SWPC acquired water rights on six of the seven sites that could be developed for power generation on the upper Saint-Maurice River, upstream of Grand-M√®re. The company signed a long-term lease for using and developing the site during 75 years, to ensure it would retain the exclusivity of hydroelectric development on the whole basin. Under agreements with the Government of Quebec, the site of Rapide-Blanc, located north of La Tuque was the first site due to be developed. However, the Great Depression of the 1930s forced the SWPC to revise its forecast of the growth of electricity demand downwards. Under its agreement with the Government of Quebec, the SWPC had pledged to start construction of a facility with a minimum power rating of by 1930, for a planned commissioning in 1933. The construction of a second unit was to follow in 1938. However, in light of the economic downturn and of the reduction in the revenue of the SWPC between 1930 and mid-1932, the company requested some changes to the lease, including its extension from 75 to 95 years. The Government agreed to change the terms, which delayed subsequent work. Notwithstanding this, the SWPC nevertheless honoured the terms of the first agreement: the construction of gravity dams of started in 1930, as provided in the agreement signed two years before. The project was relatively complex for the time, and in particular required the movement of a 50 km (31 mi) section of the railway of Canadian National, which passed through the land due to be flooded by the reservoir of the plant. Another consequence was the displacement of Indian Reserve of Coucoucache whose lands were flooded by the Reservoir Blanc. A new reserve of was assigned by the Government of Quebec on January 1932 replacing the old unit of . Shawinigan reimbursed 380 U.S. dollars to the Canadian government on 1 January 1937 for the loss of the previous reserve. Despite the difficult economic environment, the directors of the company had confidence in the project's profitability. According to the 1932 Annual Report of the SWPC, the unit cost of the first unit power was estimated at less than US$100. The production cost was due to become lower after the installation of the last two generating units (the central being meant to accommodate six, with a combined capacity of ). And had been feared by the directors of the company, the power of this new plant, whose construction was completed in 1934, was not required before the outbreak of the World War II in 1939. =Plant expansion= The production capacity of the plant was increased by the addition of a fifth unit in 1943 and sixth in 1955. World War II causes a dramatic increase in electricity demand and the three main power grids of the time - those of Montreal Light, Heat and Power, of Alcan and of the SWPC - established new interconnections to optimise the production of electricity. A fifth turbine generator was added to the Rapide- Blank facility in 1943. The war also forced the SWPC to question the safety of its installed works in Haute-Mauricie. The company established a messenger pigeon service, responsible for rapidly communicating information relating to the most remote dams in the event of air attack or sabotage of facilities and of the means of communication. The Shawinigan Journal, the internal newspaper of the SWPC, revealed in its November 1945 edition that company executives feared that a collapse of the Gouin dam could cause the destruction of downstream plants used to support the war effort. As a result, from March 1942, dovecotes were set up Rapide-Blanc and Gouin. The best pigeons of the SWPC could make the trip between the two sites - apart as the crow flies - in 75 minutes, which represents an average speed of . Following the end of the war, and due to the creation of Hydro-Qu√©bec in 1944, the SWPC was confined to a smaller territory at a time where demand was rapidly increasing. To increase the installed capacity of the hydroelectric facilities on the Saint-Maurice River, the SWPC asked the government for permission to divert the headwaters of the M√©giscane River in Abitibi-T√©miscamingue to the Gouin reservoir, whose mouth is located upstream from Rapide-Blanc. Despite opposition from Hydro- Qu√©bec engineers, the SWPC was ultimately given permission to partially divert the course of the M√©giscane River to increase the flow of the Saint-Maurice River in September 1951, just days after Hydro-Qu√©bec was granted permission to build two large dams, Bersimis-1 and Bersimis-2, on the Betsiamites River. In parallel with this diversion, a sixth turbine generator was installed at each of La Tuque, La Trenche and the Rapide-Blanc. The decision to proceed with the works was taken in 1953, and the new units were commissioned in 1955. The cost of these works, which added to the peak power of the three plants, totaled C$14 million. =The Village of Rapide-Blanc= Some of the 7 houses of the old village of Rapide-Blanc, east of the plant. They are available to Hydro-Qu√©bec employees when passing. From the 1930s, the SWPC built a village to house the workers responsible for the operation of the plant, as well as their families. A series of red brick houses were erected on the east bank of the river near the dam. The total population of the village has never exceeded 65 families. Built on the model of English garden cities, the village had 42 single family homes, comfortable and heated by electricity. As in other remote Quebec communities Rapide-Blanc houses were owned by the plant operator, who leased the space to employees. The village also had an inn of 13 rooms, an Elementary School which offered instruction in French and English, two churches (Catholic and Protestant), a General Store, a filtration plant and a medical clinic. Recreation facilities allowed for the practice of curling, ice hockey and skiing in winter, and tennis and softball in the summer. Before the construction of the La Trenche Generating Station, opened in 1950, the site was difficult to access, since workers were cut off from the road leading to La Tuque and to the rest of Quebec. Technological advances in the 1960s led to the demise of the village. In 1969, the decision to control the plant remotely from La Tuque, about downstream, was taken by Hydro-Qu√©bec, resulting in the village being dismantled in 1974, to the dismay of workers who spent their career there. Only 7 houses remain. Two of these are used by Hydro-Qu√©bec to hold meetings. The other five are available to Hydro-Qu√©bec employees, who can use them for holidays. The place is renowned for the quality of its fishing. The brook trout, the gold, the Northern pike and trout are the most frequently caught species in nearby lakes. = Automation = Chute-Allard and Rapides- des-Coeurs (pylon-shaped cross) and the line that feeds the position of beeches in Shawinigan (rectangular towers). Rapide-Blanc Generating Station was transferred to Hydro-Qu√©bec when the government-owned corporation took control of private power companies in 1963. In January 1969, Hydro-Qu√©bec announced the automation of its plants in the Haut-Saint-Maurice. The draft 2.5 million Canadian dollars, led to the transfer of 71 employees assigned to sites Rapide-Blanc and La Trenche Generating Station, and closing of the village of Rapide-Blanc, where 54 families and 240 people lived. The company then invoked the increased accessibility to the site, the preference of employees for life in an urban environment and annual savings of $C450,000 to justify the abandonment of the village. The operation of the plant was automated by using a microwave network from the summer of 1971 and the plant is controlled from a station located in the downtown area of La Tuque. As of the early twenty-first century, there are only seven small houses that have been renovated and preserved. Since automation, hydro development is visited weekly by a team of a dozen workers responsible for maintenance of the plant and the three auxiliary dams in Manowan. In 2006, the downtime of 0.86% was the lowest in the Cascades sector of Hydro-Qu√©bec. Nevertheless, the system, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2009, requires some attention; work was carried out on a valve spillway in summer 2006. The power station installed on the roof of the plant was upgraded in 2007 to accommodate a new transmission line built at a cost of CA$104.5 million dollars. long and consisting of guyed towers, a line 230 kV delivers electricity to new Chute- Allard and Rapides-des-Coeurs, upstream, to the position of beeches in Shawinigan and the consumer markets of southern Quebec.

He is known for founding Cyrene School near Bulawayo, and for introducing the Arts and Crafts style to Africans in both South Africa and Rhodesia. Some of his students were among the first professional African artists in Rhodesia.  Early life and education  Paterson was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and emigrated to South Africa with his family in 1901. He left school young and went to work at fourteen, serving part-time in the Transvaal Scottish Regiment. During World War I his regiment was called up, and Paterson served in the Namibian and East African campaigns before being demobilized in 1918.D. Walker. Paterson of Cyrene: A Biography. Gweru: Mambo Press, 1985, 1-8. After the war he was awarded a veteran's scholarship, and went to study at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. Although he possessed a tremendous love of art, Paterson was not sufficiently talented to pursue an art career on his own. He returned to South Africa, joined the Transvaal diocese of the Anglican church in 1924, and completed his religious training in 1928 when he was ordained as a deacon.  Year at Grace Dieu 1925  Paterson's artistic influence first made itself felt at Grace Dieu, an Anglican high school for Africans near Pietersburg, where he was posted for the 1925 school year. The school had an unusual syllabus that included carpentry and drawing. Paterson introduced the school's workshop students to bas relief carving, which he had learned in art school. This form of carving soon became the school's trademark style, and was continued by a nun called Sister Pauline after Paterson's departure.G. Butler. The Prophetic Nun. Johannesburg: Random House, 2000, 47. Before long, the school developed what would become Africa's first art workshop, with students and attached professional carvers producing religious carvings on commission for churches needing furniture and ecclesiastical objects. Ernest Mancoba and Job Kekana, two of South Africa's first professional black artists, emerged from this workshop.E. Morton, \\"Grace Dieu Mission in South Africa: Defining the Modern Art Workshop in Africa,\\" in S. Kasfir and T. Forster, eds., African Art and Agency in the Workshop (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2013), 42-3. . https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0253007585 The African carvers at the workshop were not given the latitude to create their own designs at the workshop, but were instead given designs and asked to transfer them onto the wood. Paterson supplied many of the designs used at the workshop through the late 1930s as a means of augmenting his small income.  Work in the Transvaal, 1928-1938  After being ordained, Paterson served a number of African congregations for the Transvaal diocese for a decade in locations such as Sophiatown and Potchefstroom. During this time he helped decorate a number of new Anglican churches in his diocese, including many murals and carvings.Walker, Paterson of Cyrene, 22-8. All this work was erased in the 1950s when the Nationalist government relocated urban Africans to townships and destroyed their old neighborhoods. In 1933 Paterson was married to Mary Phillips, with whom he would have four children.  Cyrene Mission, 1939-53  The centerpiece of Paterson's career were his years in charge of Cyrene School, near Bulawayo in Rhodesia, where he moved to in 1939. This school, which Paterson started from scratch, focused on practical and agricultural education. It was the first African school in Rhodesia to have art classes, which were made mandatory for all students. \\"Our aim is to turn out the self- contained burger type, able to farm rationally and to care for his cattle, able to build his own home and to make its furniture and even to enrich them by carving and design.\\"E. Morton, \\"Ned Paterson and the Cyrene Mission Tradition,\\" 2003, 71-2. https://www.academia.edu/6779249/Elizabeth_Morton_Ned_Paterson_and_the_Cyrene_Mission_Tradition All students took painting and drawing classes with Paterson until he left the school in 1953. He also established an arts workshop that met in the afternoons, which typically included disabled students unable to take part in sports or construction. These students also learned to carve, sculpt and produce linocut prints. Cyrene became well known as Paterson sought to exhibit his artists and sell their work in order to recoup the heavy costs of providing art education. By 1944 his artists were selling strongly among White Rhodesians. In 1947 the repute of Cyrene was sufficient to attract a visit from the King George VI's 1947 tour of southern Africa. In the wake of the ensuing publicity from the royal visit, traveling exhibitions of Cyrene student art toured South Africa, England, and the United States regularly from 1949-1953, raising enough money for Paterson to cover his annual budget deficits.J. Zilberg, \\"Drawing Paintings by Rhodesian School Children in the Smithsonian.\\" 2013. https://www.academia.edu/3622672/Drawing_Paintings_by_Rhodesian_School_Children These exhibitions made Paterson the best-known art educator in Africa of his era. Eventually a number of Rhodesia's first professional African artists emerged from Cyrene. These included Sam Songo, Lazarus Khumalo, and Kingsley Sambo.  Salisbury art training, 1954-74  Seeking new horizons, Paterson shifted to the growing urban capital of Salisbury. He continued to teach art to African children, first at Chirodzo (1954‚Äì61), Nyarutsetso (1961-68), and later at Farayi Art Center (1968‚Äì74). After moving to Salisbury, Paterson expected to have an important role at the new National Gallery, which was chartered in 1954 and established in 1957. Many of Paterson' students exhibited at the initial exhibitions, but soon Paterson and most of his students were marginalized by the National Gallery director, Frank McEwen. Several of Paterson's former pupils, Kingsley Sambo, Boira Mteki, and Thomas Mukarobgwa, ended up in McEwen's \\"Workshop School\\". He and McEwen had a number of public spats, and Paterson was effectively shut out of all major National Gallery business thereafter.  Artistic legacy  Paterson's legacy has had a mixed reception from scholars. Beyond any doubt, McEwen, whose writings and exhibitions set the tone for the burgeoning international reception of Zimbabwean art, silenced any discussion of Paterson's influence. Jonathan Zilberg has sought to revive Paterson's reputation, maintaining that the history of Shona sculpture needs to be \\"liberated\\" by focusing on its origins with Paterson.J. Zilberg, \\"The Priest Who Made Frank McEwen's Workshop School Project Possible.\\" 2013. https://www.academia.edu/5371536/The_Priest_Who_Made_Frank_McEwens_Workshop_School_Project_Possible Other recent scholarship has taken a far more negative view. Randles, for instance, has maintained that mission stations such as Cyrene generally stunted the development of their artists.E. Randles. \\"Mission Art in Zimbabwe\\", in G. Bourgois and E. De Palmenaer, eds., Zimbabwe, Legacies of Stone Past and Present, Vol. 2 (Tervuren: Royal Museum for Central Africa, 1997) 71-83. . https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9075894171 Morton, meanwhile, has maintained that Paterson's students typically copied his own limited style, and were never able to get the training they needed to progress technically. Only artists such as Sambo, who broke away from Paterson, or Mancoba, who insisted in designing his own works, were able to bypass the limited training they received from him. The rest of Paterson's students, according to Morton, produced for the tourist trade: \\"Paterson‚Äôs chief legacy is in tourist art\\".E.

He was promoted to full professor at John Cabot University in 2014. When a friend introduced him to the work of Carson McCullers, Dews discovered an affinity for her writing. This led to his doctoral dissertation on her unfinished autobiography. Five years later, after working for ten years to get permission to publish the work, he edited Illumination and Night Glare, the book based on her dictated notes for that autobiography.(cover story author bio) Oxford American, 1998, no. 20., p. 2 He added a detailed introduction and chronology, letters from World War II between McCullers and her husband to supplement the text's disjointed account, and included her outline from The Heart is a Lonely Hunter--initially called \\"The Mute\\".Armstrong, Julie Buckner, \\"Illumination and Night Glare\\" (review), The Southern Quarterly, Winter 2000, v. 38, no. 2, pp. 165-166 About Illumination, a review said, \\"Thanks to the diligent work of Carlos Dews...we are given another opportunity to look at the exceptional fiction writer (McCullers)...Dews bestows a great gift by including The Mute in his edition...\\"Schulman, Sarah, \\"Illumination and Night Glare\\" (review), The Nation, June 26, 2000, pp. 39-41 He was interviewed for The Oprah Winfrey Show in April 2004, discussing Carson McCullers's book The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, for which Oprah's Book Club lists Dews as an expert.Everett, David The Essential David Everett Reader, Lulu.com, 2012, pp. 204-205.

Overview  New Worlds, New Lives discusses the effects of globalization on a Nikkei identity,Takenaka, p. 250. concerning those from the main islands of Japan and those from Okinawa.Masterson, p. 530. This discussion of the Nikkei includes those from the Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Paraguay, Peru and United States, and also the dekasegi, Nikkei who reside in Japan.Moya, p. 389. The editors state that to understand how globalization has affected the Nikkei community one must put together Japan, the originating country, and the overall Nikkei community in a \\"triadic perspective\\";Takenaka, p. 250-251. According to the book, the \\"triadic framework\\" means examining Japan, the host country, and the ethnic organizations that link the host country and Japan along with the reproduction and maintenance of Nikkei ethnic identities. Yoko Yoshida of the Journal of International Migration and Integration wrote that \\"The greatest insight one can glean from this book is that only looking at ethnic groups in relation to their host societies does not capture the entire dynamics of the migration experience and the negotiation of cultural identity.\\"Yoshida, p. 447. Ayumi Takenaka of the University of Oxford argued that the book's chapters \\"neither address their relationship nor the impact of globalization.\\" The book considers five results that may occur due to globalization. It may increase the Nikkei identity; erode the Nikkei identity; have no visible impact on the said identity; reduce the prominence of the Nikkei identity by, as Yoshida states, creating \\"global consciousness\\"; or generate an indicator of a decreasing Nikkei identity by establishing new \\"hybrid\\" identities.Yoshida, p. 446. Yoshida wrote that the editors of the book \\"fail to answer fully which outcome has emerged because globalization is never consistently conceptualized throughout this book.\\" Of the chapters, half only cite their own case studies and do not cite anything else. Jose C. Moya of the University of California, Los Angeles argued that, in those chapters, this results in \\"a certain parochialism in their inability to engage the broader literature on migration and ethnicity.\\" Keiko Yamanaka of the University of California, Berkeley wrote that before this book was published, there was scarce information about the Japanese in South America in English, and a lot of the information had been published in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese, inaccessible to Anglophones.Yamanaka, p. 1082. Contents The volume, divided into 20 chapters, includes 18 articles. Of the eighteen authors, seventeen are either Japanese or Nikkei. The book's arguments are presented in the second and third sections. The question of conjunction and disjunction of Nikkei identities is presented in sections two and three. Yoshida argued that this was \\"an interesting way to frame these sections\\". Yamanaka wrote that most chapters have general discussions on their topics and are short in length. Yoshikuni Igarashi of Vanderbilt University stated that the average chapter length was 16 pages, and because of the short length the essays \\"read more like encyclopedia entries than critical essays.\\"Igarashi, p. 327. Takenaka argued that concluded that \\"most of the chapters seem to address some aspects of conjunction and disjunction of identities in one way or another\\" and that the chapters should have been organized by topic or geographic region. Igarashi wrote that the book had organized its nomenclature along country-based boundaries. There are four chapters that discuss Peru. One chapter chronicle Japanese Peruvian history, covering from the year 1899 to the rule of Alberto Fujimori. Another chapter refers to one opinion poll of Peruvian Japanese conducted in 1989 and another conducted in 1998 and compares and contrasts the two. There is an essay that discusses the Japanese political empowerment movements in three places: Brazil, Hawaii, and Gardena, California in Greater Los Angeles. There is also a section where the book discusses the formation of cosmopolitan, hybrid, and transnational identities. Robert Efird of Seattle University stated that the essays by Yuko Takezawa and Makoto Araki examine the boundary of what a \\"Nikkei\\" is.Efird =Part One= The first section is Part One: The Impact of Globalization on Nikkei Identities. It includes two chapters. Prior to those two chapters is the introduction to part one by Eiichiro Azuma.Hirabayashi, Kikumura-Yano, and Hirabayashi, p. ix. (Table of Contents, first page). Harumi Befu wrote \\"Globalization as Human Dispersal: Nikkei in the World\\", the introductory chapter, which puts Japanese immigration in a historical context.Masterson, p. 531. \\"Doris Moromisato Miasato argues that women are virtually shut out of leadership roles in the most vital groups, such as the prefectural (kenjinkai) associations. She suggests that traditional patriarchical patterns in the Japanese-Peruvian community have submerged a complex and adaptive feminine perspective under the simplified term of Nikkei identity.\\" This chapter is an overview of Japanese immigration from the 15th through the 21st centuries.Moya, p. 390. This chapter argues that the Japanese government encouraged immigration after 1870 in order to relieve pressures of a growing population and Befu believed that the Japanese government had acted in a callous manner towards these immigrants. Befu believes that the emigration policies of Japan had significant influence from the country's desire to gain a prominent position in the international system. Befu categorizes into three phases the transition of Japanese immigration processes: pre-modern, modernization, and post-World War II. Befu categorizes Japanese immigrants into eight groups: pre-modern immigrants, pre-World War II immigrants, post-World War II immigrants, war brides, multinational businesspersons and their families, Japanese engaging in marriages to foreigners, and who Igarashi calls \\"those who have forsaken Japan\\".Igarashi, p. 327. Befu believes that examining the development of Nikkei communities in relation to the international economic and political structures is the best way of understanding them. Yoshida wrote that \\"Nevertheless, the rest of the book lacks a consistent and explicit engagement of this theme and the concept of globalization is used differently in the various works.\\" The second chapter in Part One is titled \\"The Impact of Contemporary Globalization on Nikkei Identities\\" and it is written by the volume's three editors. =Part Two= Part two, titled \\"Conjunctions of Nikkei Identities,\\" discusses the \\"conjunction\\" of a Nikkei identity, meaning maintaining and spreading the identity. Part 2 has eight chapters organized into two subparts: \\"Community Formations and Linkages\\" and \\"The Politics of Ethnic Reproduction: Education and Representation.\\" The introduction to part two is written by Lloyd Inui. In subpart one, Jeffrey Lesser wrote \\"In Search of the Hyphen: Nikkei and the Struggle over Brazilian National Identity.\\" This chapter discusses the interaction between Brazilian nationalism and the identity politics of Brazil's immigrant groups. Lesser's chapter chronicles the Brazilian Japanese peoples' attempt to find a place in the world society as the dekasegi can be perceived as foreigners in both Japan and Brazil. The other articles in subpart one are \\"Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia: Relief Materials and Nikkei Populations in the United States and Canada\\" by Masako Uno, \\"An Approach to the Formation of Nikkei Identity in Peru: Issei and Nisei\\" by Ra√∫l Araki, and \\"The \\"Labor Pains\\" of Forging a Nikkei Community: A Study of the Santa Cruz Region in Bolivia\\" by Kozy Amemiya.Hirabayashi, Kikumura-Yano, and Hirabayashi, p. ix. (Table of Contents, second page). Amemiya's essay discusses efforts by the Japanese community in the Santa Cruz region to commemorate their history. The articles in subpart two are \\"\\"The Twain Shall Meet\\" in the Nisei? Japanese Language Education and U.S.-Japan Relations, 1900-1940\\" by Teruko Kumei, \\"The Nikkei's Education in the Japanese Language in Paraguay: The Japanese Educational System and Its Influence on the Colonies\\" by Emi Kasamatsu, \\"Peruvian Nikkei: A Sociopolitical Portrait\\" by Amelia Morimoto, and \\"Pathways to Power: Comparative Perspectives on the Emergence of Nikkei Ethnic Political Traditions\\" by Lane Ryo Hirabayashi. Yoshida wrote that \\"I found that most of the literature cited in the second section lacks a specific link to the theme of globalization and its effects.\\" =Part Three= The third part, titled, \\"Disjunctions of Nikkei Identities,\\" discusses globalization-induced \\"disjunctions\\" of a Nikkei identity. This part, which has a total of nine chapters, is divided into three subparts: \\"Gender and Identity,\\" \\"The Dekasegi Phenomenon,\\" and \\"Emerging Identities.\\" Richard Kosaki wrote the introduction to part three. Included in subpart one is \\"I Woman, I Man, I Nikkei: Symbolic Construction of Femininity and Masculinity in the Japanese Community of Peru\\" by Doris Moromisato Miasato. Miasato's essay discusses the role of gender in Japanese Peruvian communities. Miasato argues that the Japanese-Brazilian community's patriarchical patterns are hiding a feminine perspective present in the community and that many vital Peruvian Nikkei groups including prefectural associations of kenjinkai. Another chapter compares and contrasts the formations of the Peruvian and United States Nikkei communities in terms of class, nationalism, and race. In addition, the subpart has \\"Migration as a Negotiation of Gender: Recent Japanese Immigrant Women in Canada\\" by Audrey Kobayashi. This essay, which chronicles Japanese women who had recently emigrated to Canada, argues for a conclusion similar to that of Miasato's. Igarashi stated that both essays show the importance of women in the Nikkei communities. The next article is \\"Race, Gender, Ethnicity and the Narrative of National Identity in the Films of Tizuka Yamazaki\\" by Naomi Hoki Moniz. This chapter discusses the Brazilian filmmaker Tizuka Yamazaki. The first article in the second subpart is \\"The Japanese-Brazilian Dekasegi Phenomenon: An Economic Perspective\\" by Edson Mori. The second article is \\"The Dekasegi Phenomenon and the Education of Japanese Brazilian Children in Japanese Schools\\" by Masato Ninomiya.Hirabayashi, Kikumura-Yano, and Hirabayashi, p. xi. (Table of Contents, third page). This essay is about children of Nikkei Latin Americans living in Japan and their issues in the Japanese educational system. The third article is \\"The Emigration of Argentines of Japanese Descent to Japan\\" by Marcelo G. Higa. The first article in the third subpart is \\"The Nikkei Negotiation of Minorit/Majority Dynamics in Peru and the United States\\" by Steven Masami Ropp. The second is \\"The Uchinanchu Diaspora and the Boundary of \\"Nikkei\\"\\" by Makoto Arakaki. This essay, a discussion on the specific Okinawan identity, chronicles the use of academic conferences, business conferences, and organizations to create a worldwide Okinawan perspective. The third article is \\"Nikkeijin and Multicultural Existence in Japan: Kobe after the Great Earthquake\\" by Yasuko I. Takezawa. It discusses the civil responses to the Great Hanshin‚ÄìAwaji earthquake. Yoshida wrote that compared to the chapters of section two, \\"the chapters in section three more convincingly show how Nikkei communities have been affected by globalization.\\" =Part Four= The concluding essay is \\"Retrospect and prospects,\\" written by the three editors of the volume. In this chapter the editors wrote that the primary concern of the book is not the experiences of individual ethnic Japanese but instead with the concept of ethnic Japanese communities being \\"ethnic reproduction\\".Igarashi, p. 329.

Masterson of the U.S. Naval Academy argued that the book's editors \\"are to be complimented for this anthology's important contribution to the field of Japanese migration studies.\\" Moya states that the book is a \\"commendable effort\\", but that there is a sense of \\"conceptual looseness\\", or a lack of ability to compare the Nikkei of various countries because the authors did not collect and use the same statistics for all Nikkei groups. Moya concluded that \\"the book contains much that should be of interest to the readers of this journal.\\" Efird states that \\"not just essential reading for students and scholars of Nikkei issues\\" but also is an \\"instructive [primer] on the contingency of ethnic identity.\\" He argues that the main weakness is \\"scant attention to the increasing intermarriage between Nikkei and other ethnic groups.\\" Igarashi argued that while the book's editors successfully created an encyclopedic reference about ethnic Japanese and the recent academic discussions about them, this resource \\"remains, regrettably, largely unusable because of their fragmented presentation\\", stating that \\"the appeal of the collection will likely be limited to a handful of Nikkei readers.\\" Igarashi wrote that the book \\"reconfirms\\" the \\"boundaries of the Nikkei\\" by trying to create a comprehensive resource and that it is difficult to analyze the cases in the volume due to the amount of information.

Service history Osvetnik was the first of her class, and the third submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which subsequently became the Royal Yugoslav Navy. She was launched on 14 January 1929. She and her sister submarine Smeli arrived in the Bay of Kotor on 9 December 1929. In 1932, the British naval attach√© reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In September 1933, Osvetnik and the British-designed submarine cruised the southern part of the central Mediterranean. In August 1935, Osvetnik visited Malta, this time in company with the British-designed submarine . In August 1936, Neboj≈°a and Osvetnik visited the Greek island of Corfu. When the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941, she was located in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast along with the three other submarines of the Submarine Division. On 10 April, Osvetnik and Hrabri received orders for an operation against the Italian enclave of Zara on the Dalmatian coastline, but the mission did not proceed. On 17 April, she was captured by the Italian XVII Corps at the Bay of Kotor. Still in good condition, she was taken as war booty, and initially designated N1 by the Royal Italian Navy. She was refitted and modernised at Pola in the upper Adriatic, which involved the replacement of some of her armament and modifications to her conning tower. After these modifications, her displacement was ( submerged). She was commissioned by the Italians as the Francesco Rismondo, named after Francesco Rismondo, a Dalmatian-born Italian hero of World War I. Despite her submerged stability and good diving rate of 35 seconds, her age and shallow diving depth meant that she was only used for training and experimentation. Shortly after the Italian surrender, she was captured by the Germans on 14 September 1943 at Bonifacio at the southern tip of the island of Corsica, and they scuttled her four days later.

Quinn was 18 years old and working at a local Walmart when he disappeared after finishing his shift. His car was discovered several days later in a restaurant parking lot under unusual circumstances: its headlights had been left on, a live puppy had been left inside, and a drawing of a pair of lips and an exclamation mark had been scrawled in pink lipstick on the back window. Seventeen years later, on July 10, 2017, Robert Jason Owens was indicted on charges of murdering Quinn. Owens worked with Quinn at Walmart and was the last known person to have seen Quinn alive. Disappearance  At around 9:00 p.m., on Sunday, January 2, 2000, Zebb Quinn ended his shift at the electronics department of a Walmart in Asheville, North Carolina. At the time, Quinn had been enrolled in an ROTC program. He had plans to travel after work to Leicester with Robert Jason Owens, one of his co-workers, to buy a new car. Quinn met Owens in the Walmart parking lot before they drove separately to look at the vehicle. The two men were seen on surveillance footage at a nearby gas station at approximately 9:15 pm, purchasing sodas at a convenience store. According to Owens, after leaving the gas station, Quinn signaled for him to pull over by flashing his headlights. Quinn told him that he had received a page and needed to return the call. After he returned from using a payphone, Owens described Quinn as \\"frantic\\". Quinn told him that he needed to cancel their plans and eventually sped off, rear-ending Owens' truck. Hours later, Owens was treated at a hospital for fractured ribs and a head injury that he said he had sustained in a second car accident that evening. No accident report was filed with police. The following afternoon, Quinn's mother Denise Vlahakis filed a missing person's report. Two days after Quinn was last seen, a man purporting to be Quinn placed a phone call to the Walmart where he was employed. The man told Quinn's co-worker that he would not be coming to work because of illness, but the co-worker thought that the voice sounded unfamiliar and that it was not Quinn. The phone call was traced back to a Volvo plant where Owens worked. When questioned, Owens admitted making the phone call, claiming that he was doing his friend a favor after Quinn phoned and asked Owens to call in sick for him. Investigation During the investigation, police interviewed a woman named Misty Taylor, in whom Quinn was romantically interested. Quinn had developed a relationship with her in the weeks preceding his disappearance and had told friends and family that her abusive boyfriend, Wesley Smith, had threatened Quinn after he discovered the two had been speaking. Taylor and Smith have denied any involvement in Quinn's disappearance. No ties between Owens, Taylor or Smith have been established. A review of the phone records in the case indicates that the page Quinn received on the evening of January 2 was dialed from the home of his paternal aunt, a woman named Ina Ustich. Quinn had very little contact with Ustich prior to his disappearance, and she denied making the call. Ustich told police she was having dinner at the home of her friend Tamra Taylor, Misty's mother; Misty and her boyfriend, Wesley, were also present. Ustich later filed a police report stating that her house was broken into that evening. Although nothing was stolen, she reported that a few picture frames and other items were moved around. On January 6, 2000, Vlahakis received a phone call from a fellow nurse at the Asheville hospital where they both worked and former classmate of Quinn, telling her that she had seen Quinn's Mazda Proteg√© in the parking lot of a barbecue restaurant adjacent to the hospital. Police examined the car, which had been left with its headlights on; a pair of lips and an exclamation mark were drawn on the car's back windshield in lipstick, and a live black Labrador-mix puppy was found inside. A plastic hotel key card was also discovered in the vehicle, but investigators were unable to trace the hotel. Also found were several drink bottles and a jacket that did not belong to Quinn. Police collected forensic evidence from the car but uncovered no new leads. Quinn's mother believes the car was placed there by someone who had knowledge that she, Quinn‚Äôs grandmother and sister worked nearby, intending that one of them would find it.{{cite news|Title= 20 years after the disappearance of Zebb Quinn, still very few answers|url=https://wlos.com/news/local/20-years-after-the-disappearance-of- zebb-quinn-still-very-few-answers The puppy was later adopted by one of the investigators. A couple later called local police to report that they had seen Quinn's car being driven in downtown Asheville, and assisted police in producing a composite image of the person driving the car. Police would later note that the sketch bore a striking resemblance to Misty Taylor. =Developments since 2015= On March 17, 2015, 15 years after Quinn's disappearance, Owens was arrested in an unrelated incident for the disappearance and murder of Food Network Star contestant Cristie Schoen, her husband J.T. Codd, and their unborn child. Owens later admitted to killing Schoen, Codd, and their unborn child, by accidentally running over them. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of dismembering human remains. In a plea deal which his attorneys reached with Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams, Owens was sentenced on April 27, 2017. Judge Williams ordered Owens to spend between 60 and 75 years in prison without the possibility of parole. In June 2015, detectives investigating Quinn's disappearance announced they had unearthed \\"fabric, leather materials, and unknown hard fragments\\" under a layer of concrete on Owens' property. The search warrant was initially obtained March 31, 2015. According to the warrant, investigators also found an unknown white powder substance, as well as pieces of metal and concrete. On another part of the property, authorities found \\"numerous plastic bags containing possibly pulverized lime or powdered mortar mix.\\" Authorities did not comment on whether the fragments found were human bones or if they believe they had discovered Quinn's remains, citing an ongoing investigation. =Indictment= On July 10, 2017, a Buncombe County grand jury returned an indictment charging Owens with first-degree murder for the death of Zebb Quinn. According to the Asheville Police Department, \\"this indictment is the result of years of investigative work and persistence by detectives of the Asheville Police Department, as well as ongoing partnerships with members of the Quinn family and the Buncombe County District Attorney's Office.\\"Sierra Hancock, \\"Buncombe Co. man indicted for 2000 murder of missing Asheville teen\\", FOX Carolina, 10 July 2017. Owens is awaiting trial for the alleged murder, and no trial date has been set. Media coverage The case received increased visibility in 2012 when the show Disappeared covered the case.

In October 1934, Smeli visited Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia, and the Kelibia Roads off the coast of Tunisia. In August and September 1937, Smeli, along with the British-made submarine Hrabri and the depot ship Zmaj, visited Greece, including the port of Piraeus, and the islands of Crete and Corfu. When the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941, she was in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast along with the three other submarines of the Submarine Division. On 17 April she was captured by the Italian XVII Corps at the Bay of Kotor. Still in good condition, she was taken as war booty, and initially designated N2. She was refitted and modernised at Pola in the upper Adriatic, which involved the replacement of some of her armament and modifications to her conning tower. Her new displacement was ( submerged). She was commissioned by the Italians as the Antonio Bajamonti, named after the 19th-century politician and mayor of the Dalmatian port of Split. Despite her stability when submerged and good diving rate, her age and shallow diving depth limited her uses to training and experimentation. She was scuttled by the Italians at La Spezia in Liguria on 9 September 1943, the day after the Italian surrender.

Accessed online 2014-04-20. Matthews does not give a marriage date, but says that in 1907‚Äì08 Denichiro Mukai, Sato, and Sato's sister Kuni Mukai arrived in Seattle. Denichiro Mukai's first American employer, a wealthy sheep farmer, eventually sent him to school, where he learned English. His name became shortened to \\"Ben,\\" then to the nickname \\"B.D.\\" He worked subsequently in various jobs in San Francisco including as a police interpreter and head of an employment agency. B.D. and Sato Mukai moved north to Seattle after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. For a time they had a restaurant on Seattle's Fourth Avenue. B.D. later worked for Walter Bowen and Company, on Seattle's Western Avenue \\"Wholesale Row.\\" There he became familiar with the strawberries grown on nearby Vashon Island; he and his wife--she now suffering from tuberculosis--moved to the island in 1910 to grow strawberries. There were a number of other Japanese immigrants strawberry farmers on the island at the time, including the Sakai and Hoshi families. B.D. Mukai began as a tenant farmer but, exceptionally, one with enough money to hire other Japanese laborers and pickers. He and his family never had to work the fields themselves. A continual innovator, B.D. Mukai hired his own barge to get his berries to market in Seattle ahead of other growers. Sato Mukai died May 1, 1921 of tuberculosis Vashon News Record May 6, 1921 (in 1915, according to Meeker; in 1922, according to Matthewsthis photo on the mukaihouseandgarden.org site (accessed 2014-04-20) is captioned, \\"Possibly one of the last photographs of Sato, taken around 1918, when Masa was about seven years old. The family would still be working leased farmland.\\" If the identification is correct, Meeker is mistaken about the date of Sato's death.) and B.D. married her sister Kuni, who had traveled with them to Seattle and worked there as a domestic. In 1924 the Mukais set up their first barreling plant; preserving the berries in this manner allowed him to bypass the Seattle wholesalers and, instead, sell worldwide through large distribution companies such as John Sexton and Company. According to the NPS, this \\"revolutioniz[ed] the industry\\"; Mukai could sell directly to makers of preserves and ice cream. The former Mukai residence on the same property as the plant (photographed 2014) The Japanese-born Mukai couple could not own land in the United States, so in 1926 they purchased a 40-acre site (including the current Barrelling Plant site) in the name of their young son Masahiro (\\"Masa\\"), born 1911. B.D. designed an American-style residence typical of the Pacific Northwest; Kuni designed a traditional Japanese tsukiyama (hill garden; see Japanese gardens) next to it. Masa went on to be a prominent figure in the strawberry industry. He received an engineering degree from Washington State University, developed new farming techniques, and working with the United States Department of Agriculture at the Spokane Street Cold Storage in Seattle was a pioneer of frozen fruit. In 1931 Masa married Mamie Kushi; they had a son, Milton, the following year, but divorced in 1936. In 1937 he married again, to Chiyeko Wakasugi whose family farmed strawberries on Bainbridge Island, an island in Puget Sound north of Vashon. As Masa increasingly took over the business it became \\"Mukai and Son\\". The Mukai operation did well despite the Great Depression, employing 400 to 500 seasonal workers, including the pickers. Among these were Native Americans who came from Vancouver Island by canoe. In 1938 the company was renamed as the Vashon Island Packing Company or VIPCO.Pamela J. Woodroffe, Vashon Island's Agricultural Roots: Tales of the Tilth As Told by Island Farmers (2002), iUniverse. . p. 75. Citation for date 1938 for name change. Eventually, the company's business became just canning and freezing rather than farming. The business survived the Japanese American internment during World War II. Executive Order 9066 (issued February 19, 1942) ordered the relocation of all Japanese Americans living west of the Columbia River to internment camps. Masa Mukai had the good fortune to be a personal acquaintance of the Lieutenant Commander of the Western Defense Command, and was notified two weeks before the evacuation order, allowing him to move his family (himself, his wife, his son Milton and stepmother Kuni) voluntarily to Dead Ox Flats, Oregon, across the Snake River from Weiser, Idaho where Chiyeko's brother lived. His hauler Morris Dunsford operated the business in his absence; Masa Mukai worked in the seed industry in Idaho during the war years and, according to the NPS, \\"became a respected member of the community\\" there. He overcame the anti-Japanese prejudices of the locals, introduced row crops in what had previously been primarily cattle country, and invented a seed harvester to capture seeds that would otherwise have been blown away by the area's strong winds. After the war, the Mukais returned to Vashon, but the strawberry business there was no longer profitable. Although he did build a packing plant on the mainland near the Canada‚ÄìUS border in Lynden, Washington and leased another in Forest Grove, Oregon, he drew more on his engineering skills and worked in areas such as the design of sewer systems and water distribution mains, pipeline construction and home building. He slowly sold off the Vashon properties; the plant itself was sold in 1969 to a bean sprout company, and has changed hands several times since then. B. D. Mukai retired in 1935. By this time he and Kuni had divorced. He married for a third time, and traveled extensively. According to Mary Matthews, the outbreak of World War II caught him in Hong Kong. He went to Japan, where he witnessed the bombing of cities and nearly starved to death. After the war, he experienced legal difficulties in returning to the U.S. He eventually settled in Claremont, California. In 1968 he went back to Japan and told his son to sell his (B.D. Mukai's) California property and send him the balance of his bank accounts, with which he purchased and restored the family's ancestral home in Osaka, where he died in 1973. Masa Mukai died in 1999. The complex The surviving Mukai Agricultural Complex at the end of 107th Avenue S.W. on Vashon Island overlooks the former strawberry fields. The one-story wood frame Barrelling Plant building was designed by Masa Mukai and built by local contractor Deb Harrington. Also on the property are a small brick office building designed and a residence, another both designed by B. D. Mukai. The NPS states that, \\"The plant is an excellent vernacular example of agricultural industrial architecture, and the house is a well-preserved example of eclectic vernacular architecture with Arts and Crafts and Neoclassical elements of a type built throughout the Pacific Northwest in the late 1920s. The foundation of the two-story house is concrete, and a full basement features a two-car garage on the north. Constructed in a modified ell-plan, the Mukai residence possesses multiple gable roofs sheathed in wood shingles. The formal garden, also included in the historic area, retains interest as a vernacular expression of the adaptation and blending of traditional Japanese garden elements and plant materials with American suburban residential landscaping. It retains most of its original design and many of its original plantings. In its prime, the Mukai garden attracted visitors from on and off the island and was photographed for postcards. The garden also served for notable social functions when tea parties were held to view the cherry blossoms in the early spring.\\" The lettering on the plant--\\"Mukai Cold Process Fruit Barrelling Plant--is a modern (1993) reproduction \\"in jazzier blue-gray\\". The designation of the plant as a King County landmark coincided with the 1993 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, held in Seattle. The King County landmark designation covers a larger area than the NRHP designation, rather than . In 2000, the house and garden, were purchased by non-profit Island Landmarks for $327,806, out of a $469,200 fund for their purchase and restoration. Funds came from the National Park Service, the Washington State Legislature, the Casteel Family Foundation, the King County Office of Historic Preservation, and the King County Office of Cultural Resources, among others. The plan was to restore the garden, develop interpretive public exhibits, maintain the facilities, provide programs and educational opportunities with \\"free or reduced cost\\" admissions.

The new board filed a lawsuit against the former board and has renewed fundraising. As of 2014, various matters are still in litigation.

For seven years, MCA Denver occupied a renovated fish market in Sakura Square in lower downtown Denver. In 2003, developer Mark Falcone and designer Ellen Bruss, members of MCA Denver's Board of Trustees, donated land in Denver's Platte Valley ‚Äì which was later appraised at $1.5 million ‚Äì to facilitate the building of a permanent building.Carol Kino (November 12, 2007), A Museum Rises, but Not the Usual Way New York Times.

In a public process, each architect was required to give a lecture to the community. In October 2007, under the directorship of Cydney Payton, MCA Denver opened its new, 27,000-square foot, environmentally sustainable facility in lower downtown Denver designed by architect David Adjaye of Adjaye Associates (UK). The building, Adjaye's first museum commission, was designed to minimize boundaries between the exterior spaces of the city and the interior galleries of the museum. Hidden skylights fill the interior spaces with natural light, and large windows look out on the city streets. The building has five galleries as well as dedicated education spaces, a shop, library and rooftop cafe. In March 2009, Adam Lerner was appointed as the director of MCA Denver. Lerner had previously been working at The Lab in Belmar, an institution that offered modern art as well as lectures and interactive activities. Upon Lerner's move to MCA Denver, the Boards of Trustees agreed to merge the two institutions. In August 2019, Nora Burnett Abrams was appointed as the new Mark G. Falcone Director of MCA Denver.

Street lighting in the District of Columbia is provided by the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, and covers all city streets and alleys in Washington, D.C., in the United States. Because the Constitution of the United States makes the District of Columbia a creature of the United States federal government, the federal government has the authority to regulate the type and appearance of street lighting. The United States Congress has delegated a part of this authority to the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which controls the appearance of lighting standards in certain areas of the city. Authority over and history of street lighting in the District of Columbia =Early street lighting= Article One, Section Eight of the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government the authority to establish and govern the seat of government of the country. On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, created the national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Congress passed the Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. At the time, it was not envisioned that the capital city would be coterminous with the entire territory of the District of Columbia. A city charter, distinct from the Organic Act for the District, was needed. Congress enacted this charter on May 3, 1802. President Washington set the boundary of the new \\"Federal City\\" roughly where Pennsylvania Avenue NW is today. Pennsylvania Avenue was created on April 14, 1792, when the three commissioners then overseeing the District of Columbia ordered \\"the middle of the avenue from the president's palace to the capitol\\" cleared. The actual clearing of Pennsylvania Avenue began until spring 1796. In the fall of 1800, Pennsylvania Avenue was cleared of underbrush, and a raised footpath covered in stone chips was built. On March 3, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson ordered that Pennsylvania Avenue be widened and the road completed. Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the architect newly hired to supervise the avenue's reconstruction, built three lanes separated by four rows of Black Poplars. In 1803, the City of Washington enacted legislation providing for the lighting of city streets for the first time. Pennsylvania Avenue was the first city street to be lit, and it remained the only street lit at night for 39 years. =Adoption of gas lighting= Congress passed legislation in 1842 ordering that Pennsylvania Avenue be lit with coal gas street lights. But the cost of lighting with coal gas was exorbitant. In 1844, Congress ordered the street lights lit only when the legislature was in session. The first coal gas manufacturing plant was organized in the District of Columbia in 1848, nearly two decades after most major cities had them. The cost of coal gas dropped significantly. Congress ordered the street lighting system expanded in 1850 and the in-session restriction on lighting the street lamps dropped. But still the lamps remained unlit when the moon was full. Additional coal gas manufacturing plants were built in the city in 1852 and 1858, allowing gas for lighting and cooking to reach most households in the District in the 1860s. In response to mismanagement of the city's finances, Congress abolished the mayor-council form of city government in 1871. The new District of Columbia Organic Act abolished the city charters of the City of Washington, Georgetown, and the County of Washington, and merged them into a single territorial government. The office of governor was created, as well as an 11-member council, a locally elected 22-member assembly, and a board of public works. On March 16, 1871, Alexander Robey Shepherd was appointed vice chair of the Board of Public Works. Governor Henry D. Cooke rarely attended board of public works meetings, allowing Shepherd to dominate the body's deliberations. Shepherd rapidly spent millions of dollars improving the city's infrastructure. Shepherd's business sold street lights, and thus it was no surprise that his infrastructure improvements involved extending street lighting throughout the city. Shepherd was appointed governor on September 13, 1873. His tenure, however, was brief. Spending on his improvements, estimated at a then-staggering $6.5 million, rose to $9 million. With the city nearing bankruptcy, Congress enacted legislation that repealed the Organic Act of 1871 on June 20, 1874. A temporary three-person commission was formed to run the city. The temporary commission became permanent with the passage of the Act of June 11, 1878, \\"An Act Providing a Permanent Form of Government for the District of Columbia\\". The Act of 1878 established Congress as the city's legislature. A permanent three-person commission formed the executive branch of government for the District of Columbia. Two of the members were citizens of the city, but the third was appointed by the President of the United States from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The representative of the Corps of Engineers had authority over all public works and public works spending in the city. This form of government existed until President Lyndon Johnson reorganized the city government into a mayor-council form on June 1, 1967 (it took effect on August 1, 1967). The Senate confirmed Walter Washington as the first mayor- commissioner on September 21, and the nine council-commissioners on November 2.; ; ; ; ; ; ; =Adoption of electric lighting= Electric street lighting came to the District of Columbia on October 15, 1881, when the Edison Electric Light Company installed lamps at 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and at 7th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. The Heisler Company, the city's first electric utility, formed in the summer of 1882 and successfully illuminated F Street NW between 9th and 15th Streets. The United States Electric Lighting Company of the District of Columbia was formed in October 1882, took over the Heisler firm, and quickly began laying underground conduits for electric cables throughout the downtown area. But although the firm, at its own expense, erected and supplied power to street lighting along Pennsylvania Avenue, F Street, and a few other roads in the area, the city was slow to adopt the technology. It was not until 1891 that Congress agreed to pay for public lighting, which was installed on Pennsylvania Avenue SE, between 2nd Street SE and the Eastern Branch Bridge. In 1896, the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) formed in Virginia. It quickly sought to light homes and streets in the District of Columbia. After much legal wrangling, PEPCO won a contract in December 1896 to light streets east of Rock Creek. The two companies merged in 1889. Design of street lighting lampposts The United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) has statutory authority to review all the \\"design and aesthetics\\" of all construction within Washington, D.C. Beginning in 1897, many groups severely criticized the aesthetic quality of the buildings, bridges, and other sundry infrastructure of the District of Columbia. They began pushing for a federal commission to approve the design of these items, but it was not until early summer 1910 that Congress enacted legislation establishing the Commission of Fine Arts. The 1910 legislation establishing the CFA gave the commission the power to only provide advice on the siting of monuments and memorials. In October 1910, President William Howard Taft issued (October 25, 1910), which required that all new public buildings erected in the District of Columbia be reviewed by the CFA as well. On November 28, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson issued , which expanded the CFA's advisory authority to cover any \\"new structures...which affect in any important way the appearance of the City, or whenever questions involving matters of art and with which the federal government is concerned...\\" , issued by President Warren G. Harding on July 28, 1921, further expanded the CFA's review to the design of coins, fountains, insignia, medals, monuments, parks, and statues, whether constructed or issued by the federal government or the government of the District of Columbia. In 1911, the CFA adopted a temporary design for lampposts in the District of Columbia. Designed that same year by CFA member Francis Davis Millet, the \\"Millet post\\" was high and provided 392.4 candela in light. The lamp was immediately fabricated and placed into widespread use in 1912. In December 1922, the CFA undertook an initiative to both improve the street lighting in certain areas of the District of Columbia as well as design an aesthetically pleasing and uniform lamppost. Twelve designs were drafted by Captain John E. Wood, an engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers and a commissioner on the three-man Commission Government of the District of Columbia, and W.B. Hadley, a D.C. government electrical engineer. Designs ranged from a \\"Millet post\\" with a taller base to a huge double-globe post designed to light plazas and traffic circles. Captain Wood presented a final revised lamppost design to the CFA on November 15, 1923. The post was designed by Wood with input from PEPCO officials. Because commissioners felt that adequate illumination could only be delivered by two lights, the post had a cross-arm at the top. The post simple in its design, contained room for electrical wires and equipment in its hollow shaft and base, and was easily cleaned. The two-arm model was initially rejected by the CFA, however, because the arms appeared \\"stuck on\\" and not integral to the design. There were also issues with servicing and cleaning the lights in the two-arm model. A one- globe lamppost was approved instead. The approved single-globe model came in both and models, and could deliver 981 candela. On February 1, 1924, the CFA took up the issue of the two-arm lamppost again. A tall double-globe model was presented by Captain Wood. The electronics and interior were designed by Wood and James Gosling, an electrical engineer from Schenectady, New York. CFA member Henry Bacon (who also designed the Lincoln Memorial) designed the exterior of the double-globe post. The shaft was a slightly modified version of the Millet post. The cross-arms were in the Beaux-Arts style. The double- globe model could deliver 1177.2 candela, and was called the \\"Bacon double- lamppost\\" due to Henry Bacon's influence on its design. By 1926, single-globe lampposts had been erected on Massachusetts Avenue, while the double-globe version was in place on Dupont Circle, Grant Circle, and Thomas Circle. Current regulations An example of the Number 13/Number 14/Number 16/Number 18 street light used in Washington D.C. The District of Columbia achieved home rule in 1973. The District of Columbia Department of Public Works, and after 2002 the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT), had responsibility for street lighting. =Types of lampposts= Under DDOT guidelines and regulations adopted in February 2013, different type of street lights are permitted to be used in the District of Columbia. Collectively, the different lampposts and globes used in the District of Columbia are known as the \\"Washington Family of Streetlight Poles\\". *The \\"Washington Upright Poles\\" are the most decorative, and are designated the 14, 16, 18, 716, and Twin-20. The Number 16 pole (which cost $5,000 in 2013) is the most commonly used Upright Pole. The 716 is a less expensive ($2,500 in 2013) version of the 16 pole. The slightly more decorative 18 pole is generally used only in the downtown area. The Twin-20 pole is the double-globe version of the 18 pole, and is used downtown, in historic districts, and at entry points into the city. The 16 and 18 poles have a base, a bolt circle, and accommodate a 70-400 watt lamp. The 14 pole has a base, a bolt circle, and accommodate a 70-150 watt lamp. The 716 pole has an octagonal base, a bolt circle, and accommodate a 70-400 watt lamp. All Upright Poles have a steel shaft. The base, arm, and casing are either aluminum or cast iron. *The \\"Decorative Teardrop Poles\\" are decorative lampposts on which a teardrop globe is suspended from a spindle arm that extends from the shaft. There are only a limited number of these poles installed as of 2013. *The \\"Cobrahead Pendant Poles\\" are the most economical and least aesthetically pleasing of the lampposts. They have one or two arms, and accommodate a cobrahead 70-400 watt lamp. Pendant Post Poles come in two sizes: and . There are a few very high Cobrahead Pendant Poles which are tall; these very high lampposts use a 1000 watt sodium-vapor lamp. =Lamps and globes= DDOT regulations provide for the use of three type of lamps: sodium- vapor, metal halide, mercury-vapor, LED, fluorescent, and incandescent. Sodium-vapor lamps are used almost universally throughout the city, except for the Monumental Core. Metal halide lamps are used primarily in the Monumental Core. LED lamps are being introduced, and mercury-vapor and incandescent lights are being phased out in favor of sodium-vapor lamps. Fluorescent lighting is used almost exclusively for underpasses. DDOT-approved globes are made of glass or plastic. Glass globes (which cost $300 in 2013) are being phased out, as they can seriously injure individuals and cause property and automobile damage when they break. Most globes used in the city are plastic. These consist of the acrylic globe (which cost $125 in 2013) and the prismatic polycarbonate globe (which cost $200 in 2013). =Lamppost installation areas= Under federal law and DDOT regulations, streets in the District of Columbia are classified as historic or non-historic. Historic streets are required to use the more decorative poles, while non-historic streets may use the less decorative ones. All streets are required to maintain uniformity and consistency in the use and placement of lampposts. Historic streets with underground power lines may use the black Upright 14, 16, or 18 pole. Historic streets with above-ground power lines may use the black Decorative Teardrop pole. Some historic streets are further classified as Special Streets. Special Streets (also known as Capital Avenues) include roadways which are part of the National Highway System, are \\"gateway\\" streets which lead motorists into the heart of the city, \\"important\\" streets which are critical to the integrity of the L'Enfant Plan, and streets which exist within the Monumental Core. All Special Streets use Upright Poles. Special Streets with underground power lines may use the black Twin 20 Upright Pole in commercial areas, but must use the black Cobrahead Pendant Pole in residential or mixed-use areas. Special Streets with above-ground power lines must use the black Cobrahead Pendant or the black Decorative Teardrop pole. The Monumental Core streets must use either the black Upright 16 or black Twin-20 with a 400 watt metal halide lamp. Non-historic streets fall into two categories: Those areas with underground power lines, and those areas with above-ground power lines. Areas with underground power lines may use any type of pole, although the Cobrahead Pendant Pole is used only when other types are cost-prohibitive. Areas with above-ground power lines must use the Decorative Teardrop Pole, although the Cobrahead Pendant can be used if the Teardrop Pole is cost prohibitive. DDOT recommends use of the Cobrahead Pendant Poles because they are economical. The District of Columbia has a number of business improvement districts (BIDs). The 18 Upright Pole is generally used in a BID. References ;Notes ;Citations Bibliography            * External links *D.C. Department of Transportation Web site Roads in Washington, D.C.

Nishiyama (Takeshi Kaneshiro), the leader, Takamura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a very self-contained guy and Fujimoto (Masanobu And≈ç), an otaku obsessed by an anime called \\"Space Travelers\\". Their plan is very simple, enter the bank during closing time, take the money and leave within 5 minutes, then board a plane to paradise. Unfortunately for them, their plan did not go as planned since the bank manager and security guard decided to lock themselves in the bank vault that won't open until the next day instead of giving them the money. Not able to reach the money and surrounded by cops, they are stuck in the bank. They then decide to use the remaining customers and staff as hostages to gather some time to plan an escape, but they soon realize that an escape is almost impossible. With the time passing, the hostages begin to sympathize with the three robbers and decide to help them. Nishiyama gets an idea that could help them, try to fool the police into thinking that they are more than what they are in reality. They all decide to take on the identity of a member of Fujimoto favorite anime and calling themselves \\"The Space Travelers\\". Strangely every one has a character that really corresponds to their personality and they will soon begin to develop a real association to their character, forgetting their own personality, as they all begin to be more active in the new improvised band of bank robbers.

She is best known as the first woman to ascend the north face of the Eiger in 1964. Biography Voog was born 1932 in Tallinn, Estonia, and fled to Germany in 1944, settling in Munich in 1952. In her youth she was an athlete, competing in 800 metres running events and training to join the Olympic cross-country skiing team. She took up climbing while living in Munich and eventually won a gold medal in a Bavarian rock climbing competition. She aspired to become a physical education teacher but found the salary insufficient, so she became a secretary instead, working at Junkers, an aircraft manufacturer, from 1956 until August 1964. She served as a secretary for the company's owner, Erhard Junkers, with whom she was reported to have had a romantic relationship. Voog began climbing in 1959, primarily in the Dolomites range of the Alps. Her early climbs included Wildspitze (1959), K√∂nigspitze (1961) and Cinque Torri (1963). She achieved national fame on 4 September 1964, when she became the first woman to ascend the Eiger's north face, which she climbed via the Heckmair route with Werner Bittner. The Eiger was one of numerous alpine ascents she made in 1964, others included Predigstuhl, Gurrwand, Torre Venezia, Torre Trieste, Kleinste Zinne and Kleine Zinne, Monte Civetta, Marmolada, and Piz Lasties. Shortly after her ascent of the Eiger, charges were brought against Voog by her former employer, Erhard Junkers, who alleged that she had stolen over 10,000 Deutsche Mark and a car from his company. In June 1965, she was convicted of embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust by a court in Munich, and was sentenced to nine months of probation. Her conviction caused extensive controversy in the media; headlines included \\"Skandal um die 'Eiger-K√∂nigin'\\" (\\"Scandal involving the 'Eiger Queen'\\") and \\"Nordwand-Bezwingerin Daisy Voog wegen Unterschlagung angezeigt!\\" (\\"North wall conqueror Daisy Voog reported for embezzlement!\\"). In 1966, Voog continued climbing with an ascent of Sch√ºsselkarspitze via the southeast face. Little is known of her later career and her ascent of the Eiger has been reported as her only major alpine feat.

This season was split up into two half-seasons due to an increase in the Canadian budget that brought to a total of $28 million instead of the usual $14 million for a single season. The first 13 episodes aired in late 2014 while the remaining 13 aired in late 2015. Production for both parts lasted from April 22, 2014 to December 2014. Originally set to join lead-in WWE Smackdown on Thursdays after both shows were moved from Friday nights, the first half of season 5 was moved to 8/7c at the last minute due to the delay of Smackdown before returning to Fridays at 7/6c before Smackdown and Z Nation.

The site was declared a National Cultural Heritage by Resoluci√≥n Directoral Nacional No. 682-INC-2004 on June 17, 2004. The stone constructions of Yaynu are situated about 17 km south of Pomabamba at a height of more than , on the northern slope of Pa√±ahirka (Pa√±ajirca). Yaynu is the largest known Recuay site and is best described as a fortified hilltop town. The area of the town is about 25 ha at its core. When counting associated defenses, corrals and terracing, the area is over 105 ha. The central sector is bounded by perimeter walls and long trenches. The buildings are of stone and densely built up.  History  Survey, mapping and sampling excavations show that its primary occupation dates to cal. AD 400‚Äì800, by groups of the Recuay tradition. At the centre of a network articulating small nearby farming villages, Yaynu features an impressive series of natural and built defensive strategies. These worked in concert to protect the community from outsiders and keep internal groups physically segregated. The fortifications are discussed in relation to local political organization and a martial aesthetic in northern Peru during the period.

It comes with an audio CD containing four meditations.  Overview  The book begins by chronicling Werner's musical education. He was a dysfunctional learner from an early age, which he credits to the school system and the \\"cultural wasteland\\" which he grew up in. While he never practiced unless forced to, he was still the best pianist in the neighborhood, the only way he had of being accepted by his peers. When he was of college age, he applied to and was accepted to the Manhattan School of Music, where he discovered to his dismay that there were students there who could play as well or better than he could, and who practiced. He decided that classical piano was not for him, and switched to Berklee College of Music, because of its jazz program. He was relieved to find others like him, and finally began to practice in some way. While there, he took lessons with a woman named Madame Chaloff, who focused on the physical action of playing the piano gracefully. After attending Berklee three years, he visited Rio de Janeiro, where he met JoƒÉo Assis Brasil. Brasil had recently suffered a nervous breakdown from strenuous practicing, and taught Werner an exercise that his therapist had taught him. After playing nothing but this exercise for a week, Werner performed, and discovered that he was playing better, despite having only practiced the exercise. From that point, he developed his philosophy and teaching methods which led to this book. From there, the book focuses on reasons why people play, why they stop playing, and why some are afraid of playing music. He talks about dysfunctional and fear-based teaching, practicing, listening, and composing. Then he begins talking about \\"The Space\\" and effortless playing. The four meditations on the CD are meant to be listened to in-between chapters in this section of the book. He describes effortless playing in four steps: Step one is being able to play a note on one's instrument while relaxed and calm, step two is to play a free improvisation while in said state, step three is discovering what things one can play while in this state, step four is to master playing music effortlessly, hence the book's name.  Films  On September 7, 2010, the film Living Effortless Mastery was released. It includes 3 1/2 hours of clinics, master classes, and performances. In 2013, Effortless Mastery: The 4 Steps, was released. It was a recording of a lecture given by Werner in New York explaining the same concepts found in the book.  Reception  The book was received very well, with over ninety thousand copies having been sold as of 2014. It has been acclaimed by many musicians, such as Quincy Jones and Herb Alpert, who called it \\"simple, direct, perfect...and profound.\\"  Effortless Mastery Institute  The Effortless Mastery Institute at Berklee College of Music teaches the book's method, as well as tai chi and yoga. Werner has been the director of the institute since 2014. Werner has said of the instate, \\"we encourage them to make mistakes, to play carelessly. They begin to understand where they really are as a player, and the fear goes away.\\"  20th anniversary edition  In February 2016, a limited edition 20th anniversary edition was released, with additional content and a foil embossed cover.

During peace talks between the Pakistani government and TTP, Ahrar-ul- Hind issued a statement to the media rejecting the talks, and announcing that they would not accept any peace agreement. Following its initial announcement, the group claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in Pakistan, including the Islamabad court attack, before merging into the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar group in August 2014.  Etymology  The group's name literally means freedom fighters of India (referring to the Indian subcontinent as a whole). According to a commander of a Taliban group, the group derived its name of \\"Ahrar\\" from Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam, because the Ahraris were against the partition of India and the formation of Pakistan; they, rather, believed that the entire subcontinent was their homeland. The commander said that the group planned to expand their operations to the remaining part of the subcontinent.  Split from Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan  The group mostly contained Taliban from Mohmand Agency's Tribes, with some members from the Punjabi Taliban based in southern Punjab. Many of its members are based in eastern Afghanistan. While the group claimed to have split from the TTP because of opposition to peace talks with the government and after advice from a certain Paracha saab (a patwari of note), some observers believed the group was used by the TTP to carry out deniable attacks without disrupting the cease fire talks.  Relations with TTP  The Pakistani government made disowning Ahrar-ul-Hind a condition of the TTP for peace talks to continue, while simultaneously carrying out airstrikes on Ahrar-ul-Hind bases. In response, the Taliban announced a ceasefire and accepted the condition of dealing with Ahrar-ul- Hind. After this announcement, the group claimed an attack on the Islamabad High Court in March 2014. In August 2014, Omar Khalid Khorasani merged Ahrar- ul-Hind with other dissident TTP commanders into a new group called Jamaat-ul- Ahrar, formally splitting away from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan in September 2014.

In this episode, After Zelena steals Regina's heart, Regina casts a spell so that she can speak across the realms to her dead mother, Cora, to discover the truth about why she abandoned Zelena. However, when the spell is cast, not everything goes as planned. Additionally, Belle stumbles across what Zelena's ultimate end game is. Meanwhile, in the Fairy Tale Land that was, a young Cora is duped by a man claiming to be a prince, and she finds herself alone and pregnant. But a chance meeting with a real prince could lead Cora to the royal life she's always craved, but she must keep her pregnancy a secret or else risk losing everything. Plot =Opening Sequence= The tornado forms in the forest. =In the Characters' Past= In the years before the first curse, a young bar girl named Cora is swept off her feet by a gentleman named Jonathan, who tells her that he is a prince. He makes an \\"I promise you the world\\"-type vow that he will come back in two weeks with a ring of gold, and proves it by giving Cora a ring he made out of straw. But when Jonathan tells Cora that he has to leave the next day, Cora decides that she is going to sleep with him that evening. Two months later, we find a now-pregnant Cora soaking wet in the rain and her straw ring coming apart, upset that Jonathan never returned. When she reaches the castle, Cora is shocked to learn Jonathan tricked her, and is actually a gardener; She screams in shock and as he takes off, a person comes to her aid, and it's revealed to be Prince Leopold, the future husband of Princess Eva (who he has yet to meet) and the future father of Snow White. As Leopold and Cora start to bond together, this eventually leads the two to get engaged. However, this union would start to unravel when Jonathan visits Cora in the gazebo and threatens to blackmail her because she hid the truth about the unborn baby and he has become greedy by using her. Cora decides to buy his silence by giving him riches in return, not knowing that Eva, who just arrived to the palace, has been eavesdropping on their conversation. She uses that to her advantage later on at the banquet hall, where after Leopold, who has been hearing rumors of Cora's deception, learns from Eva about her after Cora lies to him about not being pregnant. Eva then tells Leopold to check Cora's pockets, which he discovers is laced with jewelry she had planned to deliver to Johnathan. Cora is then escorted out of the palace and Eva consoles Leopold, promising that she'll be able to give him an heir that is pure as snow after they are married. Months later, Cora gives birth to Zelena and afterwards leaves her near a tree, telling her daughter that because she is a miller's daughter she can't give her the life she always wanted. After she leaves, a green tornado arrives and it carries the baby away to Oz. =In Storybrooke= In the present day at the Mayor's home, Zelena has come up with a way to distract Regina, first by offering her green apples, then initiating an argument between them. It appears that Zelena's plan has worked because Zelena has used the distraction to track down Regina's heart, and has Gold serve as her tracker, leading him to Robin Hood. When Robin tries to stop him, Gold uses his power to point Robin's arrow towards Roland. Robin is left with no choice but to hand over Regina's heart to Gold in order to spare his son's life. As Regina arrives to see Robin, she tells him she was not worried because ‚Äúnothing‚Äôs worth the life of a child,‚Äù but now that her heart is with Zelena, Regina suspects that Zelena's real motive for taking her heart might be part of a bigger plot since Zelena has not killed her yet. So she pays a visit to Gold's Pawn Shop and starts searching for the answers, but not before getting an earful from Belle, who rattles off a laundry list of things that Regina did to her, prompting Regina to apologize to her. The two then discover that Regina's heart is related to her late mother's life when Regina finds the two-sided curse candle that was responsible for killing Cora over a year before. As Zelena celebrates her latest conquests by storing the heart in a box with her winged monkey watching, she turns her attention to Gold by asking him to wear a suit to a dinner she has planned. She reveals to Gold that she is planning to go back in time, and she offers to bring Gold back with her so he can be reunited with Baelfire. Gold starts pretending to think that he wronged her and he starts seducing her as a way of apologizing, knowing that she still has feelings for him. But when she discovers that Gold is after the dagger, she tanks it away from him and sends him back to his cage. Hours later at the Mayor's home, Emma Swan, Mary Margaret, David Nolan, and Captain Hook arrive to join Regina Mills in a seance to try to contact Cora from the dead, but after seeing a gust of wind blowing in, Regina comes to the conclusion that Cora is trying to keep the secrets buried with her. But just as Mary Margaret tries to finally cheer up Regina and finally bond, the two are unaware that the spirit of Cora is in the house. All of a sudden there's a knock from one of the rooms and when Regina opens it, the spirit of Cora pushes Regina aside as she goes after the person who killed her, Mary Margaret. Regina sends the two into another room, where she uses purple dust to hold Cora off, but Regina's power wears off, which allows Cora to easily knock Regina aside and possess Mary Margaret, who now sees what happened in Cora's past. However, Regina refuses to let Mary Margaret die, so she uses her magic to remove Cora from Mary's body and sends her back to the realm of the dead. Afterwards, Mary Margaret mumbles out the reasons behind Cora giving up Zelena. As she comes to, Belle, Emma, Hook, and David enter. Then, Belle reveals why Zelena needs Regina's Heart, David's Courage and Mr. Gold's Brain: Zelena is planning to create a time-travel spell, in which Zelena is planning to go back to the past to kill Eva and prevent Regina from being born. Thus, Cora would have never given her up, she would have been the one Rumplestiltskin tutors for magic, Snow White/Mary Margaret will never be born, and thus Emma and Henry would never exist. David then realizes that Zelena still needs a baby to enact the spell and that's why Zelena is trying to accelerate the pregnancy of Mary Margaret. Regina and Mary Margaret, in a private meeting, finally make a start in putting aside any differences they had in the past, bonding over the fact that their mothers weren't as perfect as they thought. Mary Margaret tells a tearful Regina ‚ÄúI know you, and you feel things deeply, regardless of having a heart or not.\\" Moments later Regina goes to see Robin Hood. She finally kisses him. Reception =Ratings= The episode placed a 1.7/5 among 18-49s with only 5.65 million viewers tuning in, down three-tenths from the previous episode but enough to win the night, as a majority of the network shows across the board also posted losses for the second week in a row.\\"Sunday Final Ratings: 'The Amazing Race' Adjusted Up; 'Dateline', 'American Dream Builders', 'The Good Wife' & 'Believe' Adjusted Down\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (April 21, 2014) =Critical reception= The episode was met with positive reviews. Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly gave it a great review, especially involving the surprising plot line: \\"There are two main ways to enjoy a twisty, plot- and mythology-heavy series like Once Upon a Time. The first is to endlessly analyze it, carefully examining and picking apart the smallest details to see how well the show hangs together as a whole. The second is to ignore the minutia -- or try to, anyway -- and simply take the show at face value, accepting that everything in it is, to some extent, made up as its writers go along (and that this fact isn't necessarily a bad thing).\\" She also added \\"That said, they are frustrating if you demand a show with a narrative that hangs together like a beautifully made suit. (Remember, though: Once is a direct descendent of Lost. We shoulda known stuff like this was coming.)\\"\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: The Heart of The Matter\\" from Entertainment Weekly (April 20, 2014) Christine Orlado of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.6 out of 5 stars. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V.

With the outbreak of World War II the Tulagi formed part of the Allied merchant navy fleet supplying the war effort throughout the Pacific and Indian Ocean theatres.  Design and construction  Tulagi was a cargo ship built by Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock of Kowloon, Hong Kong (yard no. 804) for shipping line Burns Philp. She was designed to carry produce from the Pacific to Mexico, a new enterprise for the company. She was launched on 30 March 1939 and was completed that July. She measured , , long (overall), and abeam. Her draught was . She was equipped with two 6-cylinder Harland and Wolff diesel engines of the Burmeister & Wain type, built under sublicense by Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock. These two-stroke cycle single acting engines had a combined power output of and drove twin screw propellers. The ship had a service speed of .  Early career  In the early part of the Second World War, the Tulagi had led a charmed life, surviving an intense Japanese air attack on the 16 February Allied convoy carrying reinforcements and supplies to Kupang (escorted by the heavy cruiser , the destroyer ), and the surprise Japanese attack on Darwin on 19 February 1942.  Sinking  The Tulagis luck ran out in March 1944 while undertaking a voyage from Sydney to Colombo in Ceylon, carrying 1800 tons of flour and 380 bags of mail. In command was Captain Leonard Walter \\"Dusty\\" Millar, with a crew of 15 Australian officers, 26 Indian seaman, 7 Malay and 5 Royal Australian Navy Reservist (RANR) Gunners, making a total complement of 54 personnel. On 28 March 1944 at 00:10, the Tulagi was located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, around 300 km south east of the Chagos Islands, when she was hit by two torpedoes fired by the . This U-boat, under the command of Kapit√§n Ottoheinrich Junker, had been rendezvousing with two other submarines of the \\"Monsun\\" Submarine Group and the German supply ship Brake. The Tulagi sank in less than a minute, on her starboard side, stern first. Fifteen men survived the sinking, eleven Australians, three Malays and one Indian. The survivors were divided between four rafts tied together by painters. On 7 April, one of the rafts was cast adrift and on 21 April, one of the three remaining rafts was broken up to make the remaining two rafts more comfortable for the 15 survivors. The survivors on the rafts were: = Raft 1 = J.R. Ward (Chief Engineer) D.G. Jacobs (Purser) R.T. Charles (2nd Officer) Ali Bin Sariwee (Malay Quartermaster) Note: Ali was from Jahore, Singapore Amos Helwend (Malay Quartermaster) Note: Amos was from Barbar Island in Indonesia Kalipan (Malay Quartermaster) Note: Kalipan was from Alor Island in Indonesia Basu Mian Abdul Bhooya (Indian greaser). = Raft 2 = E.J.

Murphy (Able Seaman RANR) C.H. Webber (Able Seaman RANR) Food rations obtained from the raft supplies for the first 27 days comprised half a biscuit and 12 milk tablets per day per man, plus two squares of chocolate for the first six days. On 24 April, food rations were reduced to a quarter of a biscuit per day per man, and two days later the last of the rations were consumed, except for a small number of malted milk tablets. On 19 May, the two rafts became separated and drifted apart. The raft carrying Board, Smedley, Brown and the five RANR personnel was not heard of again, but in the evening of 25 May, the other raft came ashore in Bijoutier Island in the Seychelles Group, 59 days after the Tulagi was sunk. At the beginning of the drift, the total rations consisted of 45 biscuits, two tins of chocolate and six tins of malted milk tablets per raft. Water was not a problem in the early part of the voyage due to frequent heavy rain. In May however, it became scarce and was reduced at one stage to 3 oz per man per day. Rations were supplemented by an occasional fish caught by the Malays using an improvised spear made from a pair of scissors lashed to a raft stanchion. Fishing lines in the rafts were useless as the hooks had been stolen. In all 27 fish, along with two birds and one small turtle, were captured in this manner and eaten raw. However, there were long periods with no solid food - up to 10 days at one stage and nine days on another. All three Australian survivors stated that they owed their lives to untiring perseverance and unselfishness of the Malay seamen spearing fish, catching birds and capturing every drop of rain. The seven survivors were rescued from Bijoutier Island on 26 May 1944, by Louis Gendron, a plantation supervisor from nearby Alphonse Island.

It was built by the Russian RSC Energia and the Egyptian NARSS while the incorporated cameras and payload was developed by OAO Peleng and NIRUP Geoinformatsionnye Sistemy in Belarus. A frameless spacecraft had been utilized in EgyptSat 2; it was an innovative technology being first time used in Russia. EgyptSat 2 was launched on board a Soyuz-U rocket on 16 April 2014 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome which was a milestone toward establishing the Egyptian Space Agency. History EgyptSat 2 was planned to be launched on October 1, 2013 but the launch was put on hold in 2011 following all contact being lost with EgyptSat 1 due to a failure of its S-Band communication system. Overview In 2007, Egypt made its first attempt to launch a high-resolution surveillance satellite launching the Ukrainian-made EgyptSat 1, but the satellite failed prematurely after 3 years. However, Egypt continued working with Yuzhnoye Design Bureau for the next project, until it received a bid from Russia to supply a state-of-the-art \\"eye in the sky\\". Negotiations lasted for more than four years until Egypt awarded the contract to Russia for the development of a high-resolution imaging satellite. The project was handled by RKK Energia based on Korolev on the behalf of Russia, codenamed \\"E-Star\\". 60 percent of the satellite's hardware was made by Egypt. Russia also trained Egyptian engineers to control the satellite from a ground station near Cairo. The cost of the project was rumored to be around 40 million dollar fully funded by the Egyptian Armed Forces. The spacecraft was shipped to Baikonur in February 2014 and was launched on April 16, 2014. EgyptSat 2 was launched into an orbit inclined 51.6 degrees toward the Equator which means it was only covering areas between 51.6 latitude North in the Northern Hemisphere and 51.6 degrees South latitude in the Southern Hemisphere, which covered the Egyptian territory, but did not cover vast regions of the planet in both hemispheres. Description EgyptSat 2 was a hexagonal satellite, equipped with three deployable, fixed solar arrays and nickel-hydrogen batteries, and its optical imaging payload covered the visible and infrared spectral bands, providing a ground resolution of 13.1 feet (four meters) for multispectral imagery and 3.3 feet (one meter) for panchromatic imagery. The satellite's coverage included total coverage of Egypt's land and maritime territory and their environs. A new and revolutionary technology had been demonstrated first time, as EgyptSat 2 became the first frameless spacecraft created in Russia and the first satellite created by such technology in the history of Russian cosmonautics. The frameless base technology reduces the final assembly of the satellite from six months with several trained professionals and special equipment, to 10 minutes with only two experts, which in turn minimizes effort, time and costs while not compromising the quality of the final product. Mission The satellite was supposed to supply the Egyptian government with high-resolution views of Earth for environmental, scientific and military applications. Data was transmitted through an X-band communications terminal at a rate of 300-600 Mbit/s to ground stations located near Cairo and Aswan. According to Tal Dekel, a research fellow at Tel Aviv University‚Äôs Yuval Ne‚Äôeman Workshop for Science, Technology and Security, few were aware of the extent of Egypt‚Äôs satellite program and the satellite was disguised as scientific research but in truth it would be used by the Egyptian Armed Forces as a spying satellite. EgyptSat 2 acquired its first images on April 30, that released by RSC Energia showing Taylor Bay and Melbourne, Australia. EgyptSat 2 circularised its orbit at about 720 kilometers height using an electric propulsion system. The operation completed in August 2014. The total cost of the mission was about $40 million. Assumed lost and end of mission On April 14, 2015, the EgyptSat 2 was unresponsive to commands from the Earth and control over the satellite was lost due to a human factor as the main possible cause according to the Russian Izvestiya newspaper, citing a source in the RSC Energia. While the National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences (NARSS) insisted that EgyptSat 2 is still recoverable, as the head of NARSS Medhat Mokhtar said, \\"What was reported about is in fact a regular technical failure. It happens every now and then to all the satellites. The problem will be fixed in the next few hours,\\" explaining that, \\"any failure in control of satellite begins with absence of response to commands from Earth, and the low battery could be the problem, but it will be fixed and control will be fully restored.\\" EgyptSat 2 has experienced few problems since December 2014, as it lost some of the battery capacity, also on mid-April 2015, EgyptSat 2 had an attitude control issues, then a failure of the primary and backup computer of the satellite had occurred within 15 seconds of each other and no official information was released by the satellite's operator or manufacturer. Insurance payout from the loss largely paid for the manufacture and launch in February 2019 of the EgyptSat-A replacement satellite.

Buscando la luz IV (Searching for Light IV) is the last among a series of sculptures of monumental scale produced by Chillida throughout his final creative period. The abstract piece integrates in itself the fundamental concepts inside the artist's labor. The dialogue between matter and space; the creation of sites; the organic nature of forms; and a strong ethical content are all notions that conform Chillida's body of work. The three asymmetrical steel plates that compose the sculpture are linked to each other through a complex riveting system, which delimitates in its interior a place for human encounters. The artist plays with the scale and invites us to enter the interior space of the work. Once inside, its undulant forms appear to acquire movement, raising up in search of the light.

There are four church buildings in Hagley. A Presbyterian church opened in 1879; it is now closed and in private hands. The Uniting Church building is a Modernist design built in 1957; it sits next to a wooden Methodist chapel built in 1859. St Mary's Anglican Church is a bluestone Gothic Revival building that opened for services in 1862. The lands and a significant part of the church's funds were donated by Sir Richard Dry. Dry is buried at the church and the church's tower is dedicated to his wife. Hagley Farm Primary School is the oldest agricultural school in Australia. It began as the Hagley State School in 1865 and became an area school for the surrounding districts in 1936. The school has a farm and agriculture features strongly in its curriculum. The town has some 19th- century buildings listed on both the Register of the National Estate and the Tasmanian Heritage Register. Hagley Mill is noted as possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse-driven. Quamby Estate, the former estate of Sir Richard Dry, is run as a tourist attraction and has a 9-hole golf course. Hagley's reticulated water supply is sourced from a filtration and treatment plant at nearby Westbury. This plant opened in 2013; from 1902 until then the town had received untreated water. From 1871 the town was serviced by passenger rail, but this ceased prior to 1978. Hagley was originally on the main road from Launceston to Deloraine, but was bypassed in 2001 when the Hagley section of the Bass Highway was completed. History Prior to the European settlement of what was then Van Diemen's Land, the Hagley area was a camping ground for the Port Dalrymple aboriginal tribe, the area's native people; Port Dalrymple was an early name for George Town. It is uncertain if this tribe was a separate group from the aborigines near Port Sorell and the Mersey River. The Port Dalrymple tribe ventured as far as Westbury, but mainly lived and hunted nearer the Tamar River, and stone implements have been found in the Hagley area. Encounters with the natives and reports of Europeans shooting them feature in the area's history and mythology. Stephen Dry, cousin to Sir Richard Dry, was reportedly speared by an aboriginal on a hill near Hagley. On a property formerly known as Strath is a water hole named \\"No, No's Hole\\". There is a legend that By 1830, aborigines were no longer seen in the area; they had been driven from their traditional areas by the new settlers. In October that year detachments of \\"The Black Line\\" reached nearby Westbury. This was an effort to clear Van Diemen's land of the last of the natives.Stieglitz, p.6 William Thomas Lyttleton, William Bryan and Sir Richard Dry were all important figures in the early days of the town. These three owned most of the land of what is now the town and district of Hagley during the 1820s.Scott, p.1 Sir Richard Dry's father came to Tasmania as an \\"Irish Exile\\" with Lt Governor Colonel William Patterson, founder of Launceston. He spent 13 years as Government Storekeeper at Port Dalrymple. As recognition of his work, on retirement in 1819 he was granted of land. Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted him the land that marked the foundation of settlement at Hagley. When the elder Dry died, Sir Richard inherited this and other lands in Tasmania totaling over .Stieglitz, p.23 Quamby Estate, a property owned by Sir Richard until his death, is east of the town. Quamby is supposedly an aboriginal word - although its meaning is not certain. William Thomas Lyttleton was born in 1786 in England; he was a distant connection to those owning Hagley Hall in Worcestershire, England. He spent some years in the army, moving to Van Diemen's Land in 1822 with his family, after he retired. He was initially granted near Westbury, adjacent the land owned by Richard Dry, and 800 near Meander. He called the grant near Westbury 'Hagley', in honour of the Town, Parish or Hall in England. Lyttleton built a homestead on the Hagley property in 1829, though most or all of this original building has been since demolished. He lived in the Hagley area for 14 years, before returning to England.Scott, p.2 William Bryan, builder of the first flour mill at Carrick, was granted at Hagley in March 1825. Bryan also had holdings in Carrick and Whitemore totaling .Scott, p.3 Lyttleton died in England in 1839. In disposing his estate, the estate's trustee put all of the lands up for sale. Lyttleton is believed to have bequeathed the village area to the Hagley residents. The block of land containing the Lyttleton homestead was sold in 1843 to a Dr James Richardson, and the remainder of the land was sold to others in 1848. The first building in the town was a brick church built on the side of the road from Launceston to Westbury. This road was known as the \\"Westbury Road\\", now called the Meander Valley Highway. The church was built for Church of England services and opened in 1848.Watson, p.23 It was built at the behest of Sir Richard Dry and Archdeacon R. R. Davies, the latter trustee of the Lyttleton estate, on part of the former estate. The land was a gift to the Church of England by Davies in his capacity as a trustee.Scott, p.32 By 1849, the town's buildings were the Hagley Church of England, an inn--built and run by the East Family opposite the church--and three paling-clad cottages occupied by separate families. At this time the Westbury Road was often a muddy quagmire and land, especially near Quamby bend, that is now cleared was dense forest. The Hagley Inn was opened c.1850, it was first called \\"The Country Inn\\", by James East, who had run the earlier inn in Hagley. Over time the inn has been extensively altered and it closed as a hotel in the late 1980s. In 1850 Hagley's buildings comprised Hagley's population increased significantly during the 1850s as people moved both to the village, and to farming properties in the district. A doctor was practicing in the area by 1854,Stieglitz, p.28 and in 1855 a school opened in the Church of England; paid for with funds raised by local residents.Scott, p.20 That year a postal service began in Hagley. David Parry was appointed postmaster on 1 July 1855, probably operating an unofficial post office from the Hagley Inn. A post office officially opened on 10 June 1865, in a building that was demolished in 1970. This building also had a store called the \\"six day store\\" run by the postmaster and his wife. The town gained a second hotel in 1857 with Carmody's Meander Hotel, though this remained open for only a few years. In 1857 also the town's first community organisation was formed, the Hagley Ploughing Association, and regular ploughing matches began.Scott, p.23 A second church was built, a Methodist Chapel on the Westbury road, in 1859. Mrs Bryan and her husband were concerned about the lack of education in the area. In the early 1860s they provided two acres of land at nearby Glenore,The Glenore School was a few miles south of Hagley rather than in the town itself and built a brick school and school house.Scott, p.24 The Glenore school was finished in 1862, and it was accompanied by a farm whose rent was to pay for a teacher and building upkeep.Scott, p.25 A new church, for the Church of England, was built just outside Hagley. St Mary's Church of Hagley and Quamby was completed and opened in 1862.Scott, p.19 The first church continued in use as a school until 1865. In the prior year construction had begun on a public school, a two-room building with an adjacent 8-room teacher's residence; the school opened in 1865. Hagley was gazetted as a town in April 1866.Scott, p.17 By that time it had a number of stores, a blacksmith, a boot maker, a saddler, a wheelwright, two churches, two schools, two hotels, a resident seamstress and a midwife. By the late 1870s the town had gained, in addition to houses, a police station, gaol, engineering works, one steam mill run by the Noake Family and another at nearby Quamby. A rail line opened, from Launceston to Westbury, in 1871, though its station was from Hagley. In the 1880s a siding was added at Hoggs Lane, and a passenger platform at the siding in 1910. Using the new rail line, by the 1880s the post office was receiving four deliveries each weekday and two on Saturday. Electricity reached Hagley in 1928, supplied by the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission. Prior to this--the year is unknown--there was some street lighting in the form of four dim Kerosine lamps set on posts. These lights were manually lit and extinguished daily.Scott, p.31 In 1941 the Hagley Flax Mill began operating to process locally grown flax. This mill was on the Meander River's bank, three miles from the centre of Hagley.Stieglitz, p.32 Hagley was gazetted as a locality in 1968. Geography and demographics Hagley sits on mostly flat land near the Meander River at an elevation of above sea level. The land formation is largely alluvial with Lateritic podzolic soils, classified as dermosol under the Australian Soil Classification system. These soils date from the Tertiary Period, with some from the more recent Quaternary. Hagley was founded, and remains, an agricultural centre. Dairy and pea-farming prior to World War II have given way to poppies as the principal crop. These poppies are opium poppies grown for Tasmanian Alkaloids, in nearby Westbury. The Meander River forms the northern boundary. In the first Australian census in 1911 there were 611 people resident in the town and surrounding area. By 1931 this had reduced to 246, of which 186 lived in the town. In the 2011 census 330 people were recorded living in 148 dwellings in the Hagley statistical area. The census did not record the town's population but the Meander Valley Council notes it as c.150 in 2014. Hagley's people are predominantly Australian born with 89.1% reporting as such in the 2011 census. This contrasts with 83.6% for Tasmania and 69.8% for the whole of Australia. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the state legislative council Electoral division of Western Tiers, and the Division of Lyons for both the state and federal houses of representatives. Road infrastructure The Bass Highway (National Route 1) enters from the east and runs through to the west, where it exits. Route B54 (Meander Valley Road) also passes through from east to west, crossing over the Bass Highway near the western boundary. Route C507 (Hagley Station Lane) starts at an intersection with B54 and runs south, crossing over the Bass Highway, until it exits. Route C732 (Westwood Road) starts at an intersection with B54 and runs north-east until it exits. Route C735 (Selbourne Road) starts at an intersection with B54 and runs north until it exits. =Climate= Sports Hagley's war memorial, and recreation park The sport of coursing began in Tasmania at Hagley, an event was held 6‚Äì7 June 1878 at Quamby. For this first event 500 people, including the Governor of Tasmania, came from Launceston. Tasmanian Government Railways ran an excursion train service from Launceston for the event.Scott, pp.47‚Äì48 A coursing competition called the \\"Waterloo Cup\\" has a long history in the town.The Waterloo cup is mentioned in newspapers including: Burnie Advocate, p.2, 14 June 1943; The Age p.4, 23 June 1936; Launceston Examiner, p.9, 8 June 1951; Otago Witness, p.21, Issue 1641, 5 May 1883 Hagley's recreation ground opened on the main road in 1902; until then local paddocks were used. An Australian rules football club was formed in Hagley c.1895. Matches were played on a private paddock until 1902 when they moved to the recreation ground.Scott, p.49 The club's most successful period was, as part of the Esk Association, when they won five successive premierships from 1949‚Äì53.Evans & Terry, p.77 The club closed in 1998, as part of a general decline of country football in Tasmania. During the club's 102 years, the most widely known player was former St Kilda player Matthew Young. Hagley's cricket team was formed in the 1890s and was playing by 1896. Similarly to the football club they played on a paddock, adjacent to the current recreation ground, moving to the new ground in 1902.Scott, p.50 The ground remains open for cricket though Hagley no longer fields a team. Water supply In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, providing for construction of a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes. For over a century the water was supplied untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, from time to time contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system.Department of Premier and Cabinet, p.24 Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley. Religion and churches =Presbyterian= Hagley Uniting Church (front) and original Methodist Chapel (rear) There was a Presbyterian visiting preacher in Hagley, from Deloraine, Tasmania, from 1854. Services were held at this time in the Methodist Chapel. Regular Presbyterian services were being held by 1855, most likely in the original Church of England building.Scott, pp.40‚Äì42 In the late 1870s, the old Church of England was purchased, along with the associated land, by the Presbyterian church for 265 pounds. The building was demolished in 1878 and construction of a new church was begun almost on the same site. During demolition and construction, Presbyterian services were again held at the Methodist chapel. The foundation stone was laid 18 March 1879 by which time the walls were already nearly complete. Cement rendering has hidden the stone and its location is uncertain. Hagley Presbyterian Church's first services were held on 14 December 1879. A manse was built nearby in 1884. The church used bricks from a demolished brewery, possibly in Longford, and it was completed at a cost of approximately 950 pounds. The building was designed by Harry Conway, a Launceston architect. It is a largely brick building with freestone corbels and copings, and is of a Gothic Revival architectural style. The church is with a vestry, and was intended to seat 250 people. By 1973 the Presbyterian congregation at Hagley was very small and there was cause for concern about its future.Miller (editor), p.33 The Presbyterian church building is still in the town, opposite the original Hagley hotel, but is now privately owned and no longer used for worship. =Methodist and Uniting Church= Hagley has a Uniting Church, built in 1957, adjacent to the original Methodist Chapel which dates from 1859. Early Wesleyan (Methodist) services were held in the 1840s in a farmhouse in Hoggs Lane.Scott, pp.34‚Äì35 Local Methodists began raising funds for a church in the late 1850s. Land was donated by a George Scott and, at a cost of 370 pounds, a wooden chapel and two-roomed caretaker's cottage were built. This Methodist chapel opened for services on 27 March 1859. What is now Hagley Uniting Church was built next to the old Methodist church in 1957. This newer building is of a Modernist design with coloured glass and geometric architectural shapes. The Uniting Church site was listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register in June 2009. The church held its final service 31 January 2016. Low attendance and high maintenance costs were cited as reasons for its closure. =Church of England (Anglican)= Hagley's first building was a brick church, on \\"Westbury Road\\" for Church of England services. The foundation stone was laid 8 January 1847 and the church completed, using materials from Deloraine, and opened 9 June 1848. It was built on part of the former Lyttleton Estate, funded by Sir Richard Dry and the estate's trustee, Archdeacon R.R. Davies. When completed the church was in the Parish of Westbury. By 1859, with population growing, parishioners in Hagley held a meeting to consider forming their own Parish.Scott, p.36 Dry offered to pay the Minister's stipend and provide 1000 pounds towards church buildings. Consequent to this offer, the separate Parish of Hagley and Quamby was created.Scott, p.37 This first church was used until completion of the later St Mary's Church. It was later demolished to make way for a Presbyterian Church.Scott, P.33 St Mary's Church (1862) The Church of England's parish of Hagley had its beginnings in 1856 when Dry endowed it with three farms. Between them these farms brought in 400 pounds rental income per year.Barrett, p.15 While in England, on a trip taken for his health, Dry commissioned architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter to draw plans for a new church. The plans were modified by Carpenter's agent in Hobart, Henry Hunter. On returning to Tasmania, Dry donated of land for the church.Scott, p.38 Hunter was also responsible for designing churches at Westbury, Deloraine, Colebrook, Tasmania and the Church of the Apostles in Launceston. Dry funded construction of the rectory and funded a significant part of the church's construction. Some other funding came from the sale of the original church and land. As first built it only had a nave and aisle. The brick rectory was completed in 1861, before construction of the church began. St Mary's foundation stone was laid 10 December 1861, in a ceremony attended by Dry and Bishop Francis Nixon, the first Bishop of Tasmania. The church's structure used local bluestone for the walls, freestone from Bellerive for pillars, arches and mullions, and roof slates from Great Britain. St Mary's is built in a Gothic Revival architectural style. It was completed and opened in a ceremony on 26 November 1862. Dry had asked to be buried at St Mary's.Stieglitz, p.23 After his death in 1869 a memorial at the church was proposed. The memorial chosen was a chancel, which the original church lacked. Funds were raised by a Government backed appeal, including a donation from Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. The chancel was started in 1871, using bluestone from the same quarry as the church, and was finished in August of the same year.Scott, p.39 To this point the church was seen as incomplete and had not been consecrated. After completion of the chancel St Mary's was consecrated, by the Bishop of Tasmania Charles Henry Bromby on 24 August 1871. A tower, spire and vestry were added in 1932, after work began the prior year. The building work was funded by a bequest from Lady Dry and a Miss Jane Patterson, a St Mary's churchgoer. The tower is dedicated to Lady Dry and the spire and vestry to Miss Patterson.Stieglitz p.26 The spire was designed by H S East, who also restored St Andrew's church at Westbury. The additions were consecrated 6 December 1932.Stephens, p.72 St Mary's church houses recreations of two significant artworks, both donated in 1857 by Lady Clara Dry. The first is a recreation of Guido Reni's 1610 altarpiece from the Quirinal Palace, Rome. The second a 19th-century copy of Raphael's Transfiguration. Both were purchased in Italy during the Dry's honeymoon, and were restored in 2004. It also contains a copy of Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo's Crucifixion in the East window--a gift from Lady Dry-- and a copy of Raphael's Annunciation. The Nave houses an organ built in 1861 by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London. The organ is essentially original, with only the addition of electric blowing, and includes one manual and seven speaking stops. Education The original 1865 building of Hagley Farm Primary School Early education in Hagley was by private tutors. In 1855 a school opened in the Church of England building, taking in both borders and day scholars.Stieglitz, p.30 Schooling had to sometimes be interrupted as the building was used during school hours for marriages, and religious services.Stieglitz, p.31 William Bryan and his wife donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862. The Bryans left a bequest that fully funded the school until 1914, when the state's education department assumed responsibility for the building and the teacher's salary. By 1921Scott, p.26 lists this date incorrectly as 1821 rather than 1921 56 students were attending. The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built a short distance away.Scott, p.26 Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her bequest, the school was used at times for religious services, by Methodists and Anglicans. Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 and the few remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore. Hagley has a single school, Hagley Farm Primary School. It teaches reception to year 6 for, as of 2014, 420 students. The school has a commercial farm attached. The farm is varied with cattle, sheep and crops. The school is the oldest that is specifically dedicated to agricultural education in Australia. The original school building was built in 1865, on of land just east of the town donated by Sir Richard Dry. This first building is of Gothic Revival form. Its structure and interior are largely intact and original. A decision was made in the 1930s to make Hagley an area school. As of 1935, there were five single-teacher schools in the local area. All of these were closed and Hagley opened as the \\"Hagley Area School\\" on 30 January 1936. Its curriculum was much expanded from prior years' and included classes on nutrition, construction, agriculture, housewifery, cooking, carpentry and dressmaking; these classes were segregated into traditional gender roles. Students from the closed schools were brought to Hagley by bus. At this point most rural schools stopped education at grade 7 but from 1937 Hagley was extended to teach grade 8. In the late 1930s the school served Hagley, Carrick, Hadspen, Rosevale and these town's surrounding farms, using two buses to transport students.Maslin, pp.15‚Äì26 Hagley and Sheffield were the first two area schools in Tasmania. A residential side to the school was planned in 1939. Buildings would be added and agricultural work expanded with a full sized farm. The start of World War II caused the building plans to be cancelled though they were soon reinstated, and in 1941 building work began. The reversal was spurred by the desire to accommodate victims of The Blitz, though this particular use never eventuated.Maslin, pp.29,31 The school became residential, for boys, and its farm was extended to . The first borders were the sons of servicemen. With the extension of the land--the government had purchased around the school--the school widened its activities and became known as the Hagley Farm School. Students, as part of their education, built many of the farm's buildings during the war. J Maslin had been principle since 1931. In 1944 while explaining the schools philosophy he stated > We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, while we shut our children and > our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. > Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will > be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948‚Äì55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since. Transport A rail line near Hagley was first surveyed in 1856, as part of a route from Launceston to Deloraine. A decade later a Railway Act was passed, strongly supported by then Premier of Tasmania Sir Richard Dry. A private company, the Launceston and Western Railway Company, was formed to build the route and the first sod turned in January 1868 by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. The rail line passed south of the town and a station was built distant. The line opened, and the first train passed near Hagley, on 10 February 1871.Scott, p.27 The rail line carried passengers, and several daily mail deliveries.Scott, p.21 Launceston and Western Railway soon ran into financial problems, the line closed 29 June 1872 and the company itself went bankrupt on 25 July. The government took over the railway, as the Tasmanian Government Railways, on 31 October 1873. Local farmers petitioned for an additional line to properties in Hagley's west. Construction began on the new line in 1887 and a siding as built at the intersection of Hoggs Lane. This siding was used first for farm produce, later facilities for loading stock were added. A platform and waiting room were added in 1910, though it was some years before passenger trains stopped at Hoggs Lane.Scott, p.28 The passenger rail service had stopped before 1978, a time when all Tasmanian passenger rail services ceased.Cooper and Goss, p.5 The road through Hagley, now called the Meander Valley Highway, was originally the main road west from Launceston. Beginning in the 1990s work began on a replacement highway that would bypass all the towns between Prospect and Deloraine, including Hagley.Department of Premier and Cabinet, p.37 As the road was part of the National Highway this work was funded by the federal government. The federal transport department announced, in 1999, that they were to spend $36 million bypassing Hagley and Westbury with the new Bass Highway. A this time 7600 vehicles per day were driving through Hagley, the bypass was expected to more than halve this. The new highway passed by the historic Hagley Mill site and so, as part of the construction, the federal government funded pre- and post- construction preservation work on the Mill site. Local residents were concerned about the impact on Hagley of the reduction in through traffic and the Westbury-Hagley Development Committee was investigating. The town's centre was finally bypassed when the Bass Highway's Westbury-Hagley bypass was opened on 13 December 2001. As of 2014 the only public transport in Hagley is school buses, operated by the private Westbus and Redline Coaches companies. Historic buildings Hagley retains 19th century buildings, some are listed on the now closed Register of the National Estate,A searchable index of the Register of the National Estate was, as of 19 April 2014, accessible on the Department of the Environment website some also on the Tasmanian Heritage Register. Hagley house is a brick and stucco, two-storey Georgian era house from the town's centre. Construction was begun by William Lyttleton prior to 1848, at which time it was noted as incomplete, and completed, after Lyttleton's death, by Dr Richardson. Hagley mill is a historic site, south of Hagley's centre, on part of the former Hagley Estate. The mill and land are owned by the Department of Transport; they were acquired as part of the construction of Bass Highway. The site's significance is that it is possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse-driven, and almost certainly the only example in Tasmania. The mill and associated buildings date from 1830‚Äì40. The mill appears to have been converted c.1870 to fit a mobile steam mill. Its wheel house has original ironstone foundations and brick walls forming an octagonal building, a design peculiarity to accommodate the horses and driving mechanism. The site has a barn, one-room cottage and dairy that all date from the mill's construction. Quamby house was built for Sir Richard Dry in 1838, probably to a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter. It was built mostly by convict labour, using locally made clay bricks, in an American Colonial style, a single storey with a stone-flagged long veranda. The original estate was broken up in the second half of the 19th century.Stieglitz, p.25 Quamby was opened for tourism, by Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett on 4 October 2009. It is operated as the Quamby Golf and Country Club, and has a par 38 9-hole golf course that dates from the early 1990s.

World War II  When Axis forces occupied Yugoslavia in April 1941, Usta≈°e forces of the Independent State of Croatia occupied Sand≈æak and established detachments of Muslim militia. Rovƒçanin was a commander of a detachment of Sand≈æak Muslim militia from Komaran (Brodarevo in Sand≈æak). Together with other commanders of Muslim militia (including Sulejman Paƒçariz and Osman Rastoder) he participated on the conference in village Godijevo and agreed to attack Serb villages near Sjenica and other parts of Sand≈æak. After the Capitulation of Italy in September 1943, communists tried to negotiate surrender of Rovƒçanin and his troops. Since Rovƒçanin insisted that Komaran and Brodarevo should remain under the control of his detachment of Muslim militia, negotiations failed. At the end of October 1943 Partisans captured Komaran and Rovƒçanin and his militia had to retreat toward Sjenica. Germans promoted him to the rank of Captain. On 7 November 1943 Rovƒçanin led his forces of 300 ‚Äî 400 militiamen from Sjenica toward Bijelo Polje. On 8 November Partisans defeated them. Rovƒçanin was killed in the battle against Partisans on 26 April 1944 in the Biokovac village. His militiamen wore German uniforms.  Controversies  There are controversial interpretations of Rovƒçanin's role during the Second World War. According to some of them he cooperated with Chetniks and died protecting the retreat of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá. According to this predominantly Chetnik view, Rovƒçanin belonged to small group of commanders of Muslim Militia who refrained from attacks on Christian population and who pursued the policy of cooperation with Chetniks and correct attitude toward Serbs. According to this view, this policy saved lives of many civilians (both Christian and Muslim) in Brodarevo, Prijepolje and Bijelo Polje. Some Chetnik sources say that Captain Rovƒçanin and his detachment from Komaran joined Chetniks without any conditions, and protected their region from communists.

On May 13, 2014, it was revealed that the season would be split into two parts, the first half airing during autumn 2014, and the second half during spring 2015 of the 2014‚Äì15 television season.

In August 2014, Maleficent was reported to be the main villain for the second half of the season. Prior to the season premiere, a special aired recapping the previous three seasons, and finished up with the introduction of the Frozen storyline. The theme for the season is \\"Never give up on the people you love\\". Adam Horowitz initially announced that the 2-part episode, \\"Smash the Mirror\\", would air at the earlier time of 7/6c and will be two hours long, however this was later contradicted by the official Prime Time schedule which stated that it would premiere in its usual spot of 8/7c, the official ABC press release for the episode and the Futon Critic also supported this start time. Horowitz later clarified via Twitter that the extra hour was in addition to the already announced 22 episodes. He also confirmed that the winter finale would air on December 14, 2014, and later confirmed that the show will return from winter hiatus on March 1, 2015. On March 15, 2015, Horowitz confirmed that the last 2 episodes of the season will form a 2-hour episode. It has been confirmed that, unlike the Frozen arc, the villains of the second half of season 4 will come from \\"[Once Upon a Time] mythology\\" instead of from their respective movies, so their origins will not be how people remember them, in particular, creator Adam Horowitz stated that \\"[Once] Cruella may have a different backstory than the one that people may remember from the movie\\" and explained that Maleficent has already been slotted into the mythology in previous seasons. Another special, similar to the special that aired between the season 3 mid-season finale and premiere, aired an hour before the mid-season premiere on March 1, 2015 and was titled \\"Secrets of Storybrooke\\" and narrated by starring cast member, Jennifer Morrison. The special focused on the topic of what it takes to have familiar fairy-tale characters who have been flipped on their heads from their respective origins. =Casting= After Once Upon a Time in Wonderland was canceled, it was reported that Michael Socha, who portrayed Will Scarlet / the Knave of Hearts on the spin-off, was in talks to join the main cast of Once Upon a Time as a series regular should the series receive renewal for a fourth season, this was later confirmed on April 20, 2014 and on May 8, 2014, Socha was hired following the season 4 renewal. Michael Raymond- James was confirmed to not be returning as a main cast member, since his character, Neal Cassidy, was killed off. During Comic Con 2014, it was officially announced that Ginnifer Goodwin was returning as Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard along with fellow cast members Jennifer Morrison as Emma Swan, Josh Dallas as Prince Charming / David Nolan, Colin O'Donoghue as Captain Killian \\"Hook\\" Jones and Jared S. Gilmore as Henry Mills, Lana Parrilla as the Evil Queen / Regina Mills and Emilie de Ravin as Belle. De Ravin also confirmed Robert Carlyle's return as Rumpelstiltskin / Mr. Gold, through a photo on her Instagram. On July 1, 2014, it was announced that Scott Michael Foster had been cast as Frozen character Kristoff and Elizabeth Lail as Anna. The following day, it was announced Georgina Haig had been cast as Elsa. On July 8, 2014, Elizabeth Mitchell was revealed to have been cast in an undisclosed role. It was later revealed that she would be playing an evil Snow Queen, much like the one from the original Hans Christian Andersan fairy tale. The character would be Anna's and Elsa's aunt, Ingrid. Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz had also cast a real reindeer as Sven. On July 28, 2014, Tyler Jacob Moore and John Rhys-Davies were both announced to be playing Prince Hans and Grand Pabbie, respectively. The third episode, \\"Rocky Road\\", revealed that the roles of two of Hans' brothers, Franz and Jurgen, had been given to Nils Hognestad and Marcus Rosner respectively. Returning recurring cast members include Sean Maguire as Robin Hood, Christie Laing as Maid Marian, Giancarlo Esposito as the Magic Mirror / Sidney Glass, Beverley Elliott as Granny, Lee Arenberg as Dreamy / Grumpy / Leroy, Raphael Sbarge as Jiminy Cricket / Dr. Archie Hopper and Keegan Connor Tracy as the Blue Fairy / Mother Superior. Faustino Di Bauda also returned as Sleepy / Walter and so did Kristin Bauer van Straten as Maleficent. On September 4, it was revealed that Frances O‚ÄôConnor was cast as Belle's mother, Colette for the sixth episode, although appearances later on in the season were also hinted.

Biography Mariquita is said to have been found by a female dancer as a small child beside a fountain near Aumale in Algeria. She learnt to dance even before she could read. She arrived in Paris in the 1840s and later became a choreographer and ballet mistress at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, the Folies Berg√®re and the Op√©ra Comique. She trained several show dancers of the period including Liane de Pougy, √âmilienne d‚ÄôAlen√ßon, R√©gina Badet, and La Belle Otero. One of Paris's most popular dance instructors in the late 19th century, she debuted at the Th√©√¢tre des Funambules in 1845. Mariquita was engaged by Albert Carr√© as ballet mistress at the Op√©ra Comique in 1898 where she remained until 1920, creating some 60 shows, while continuing her role as director of dance at the Folies Berg√®re. Carr√© reported that she \\"knew the dances of every period and from every country\\". According to Cl√©o de M√©rode, despite her small size, she was an imposing figure, always standing straight so as not to diminish her height. Wherever she went, she had her lorgnette and her fan with her. She always held her fan in her right hand, using it as a conductor's baton. In 1900, she was appointed choreographic director at the Palais de la Dance at the Exposition Universelle. She retired on 16 April 1920 after an evening attended by the leading artists of the period, completing a career lasting over 70 years. Her repertoire was generally exotic and imaginative but towards the end of her career she introduced more complex routines including Basque and Greek dances.

Its fossil remains have been found in Portugal, in the well-known fossil locality of Guimarota, which is in the Alcoba√ßa Formation. It may have been a semi-aquatic burrowing insectivore, similar in habits to desmans and the platypus. Several specimens are known, include a partial skeleton and well-preserved skulls.  Description  Haldanodon was about as long as a desman, and may have had a similar ecology. The skull was low and triangular when seen from above. For many years it had the best-known skull material of any docodont, making it vital for understanding the taxonomic position of that mammaliaform group. It was the first Mesozoic mammaliaform discovered to possess turbinal plates, a complex feature of mammalian nasal cavities. However, it also retained some curiously primitive traits in common with non-mammaliaform cynodonts. The body was compact and the legs were short and robust. The articulation of the distal humerus was particularly expanded, indicating strong muscles for either digging or swimming. The front paws were relatively short, and the bones of the forelimb were curved and laterally compressed.  Classification  Haldanodon was a docodont, part of a group of Jurassic to Cretaceous early mammaliaforms with specialized teethLuo Z-X and Martin T. 2007. Analysis of molar structure and phylogeny in docodont genera. Bulletin of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The docodonts were widespread in Laurasia, and show an interesting diversity of ecological lifestyles unknown in other Mesozoic mammaliaforms. Haldanodon is specifically considered a docodontid, and has been found as the sister taxon to Docodon in many analyses. ;Phylogeny  Paleobiology  Haldanodon may have been a fossorial (burrowing) and/or semi- aquatic insectivore, similar in lifestyle to the modern desmans and Ornithorhynchus (the duck-billed platypus). This is indicated by some skeletal features, such as a wide scapula and stout limb bones with specialized joints. It likely had a sprawling gait based on the configuration of its limb joints, but this is probably a result of its specialized lifestyle instead of a primitive trait. The fingers and claws of the forelimb seem to correspond closely to scratch-digging modern mammals like armadillos and pangolins, rather than shovel-diggers like moles.

It was also known as the Aboriginal Child Placement Agency (ACPA).Linda Briskman, The Black Grapevine: Aboriginal Activism and the Stolen Generations, p.42) The Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency (VACCA) promotes a culturally respectful and culturally appropriate approach to Indigenous children and families. VACCA played an important role in bringing to light the full extent of the horrors of the Stolen Generations. History The Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency (VACCA) was established in 1976 after discussions at a national adoption conference held that year. In particular, Mollie Dyer's contribution to the conference and increasing pressure from the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service which saw the link between child removal from Indigenous families and over-representation in the criminal justice system. The Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency became a model for other Aboriginal and Islander Child Care Agencies nationwide and spent time networking with activists in other states to ensure the success of the other agencies.Linda Briskman, The Black Grapevine: Aboriginal Activism and the Stolen Generations, p.41)Mollie Dyer, \\"Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency\\", in C. Picton (ed) Proceedings of the Second Australian Conference on Adoption 1978, p. 182. Out of the state-based agencies, and as a result of the 'First Aboriginal Child Survival Seminar' held in Melbourne in 1979, the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) was established in 1981 as a national non-government body representing the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families.

It is a notable realization of the interwar Serbian church architecture, but also the Russian builders who immigrated to Serbia because of the civil war in their homeland. Construction and architecture The idea of raising a memorial church with a charnel-house in Lazarevac stemmed from the need to store the relics of warriors killed in the Battle of Kolubara in 1914, on the battlefields around Lazarevac. In order to implement these ideas, a \\"Committee to raise the memorial church and charnel-house in Lazarevac\\" was established in 1921. It was headed by the priest ƒåedomir M. Popoviƒá. In 1937, the Committee ceased to exist and the \\"Association for raising memorial church with charnel-house in Lazarevac\\" was formed, led by the priest Borivoje ƒêorƒëeviƒá. In the architectural tradition of the twentieth century, which developed in the area of today's District of Lazarevac, the dominant type of building is a longitudinal building with prominent bell tower on the western front. The Memorial Church in Lazarevac represents a bold step forward which opened a new chapter in church architecture from this area. The spirit of historicism is clearly expressed in this building. Deep understanding of old and new ideological and aesthetic principles is an important segment in analyzing historical and artistic importance of the Lazarevac memorial church with the charnel-house. Lazarevac memorial church\\"Dossier of Cultural Monuments: Memorial Church in Lazarevac\\", Belgrade City Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments with the charnel house is inspired by the Presentation of the Virgin Monastery in Senjak in Belgrade. Lazarevac temple was built by the project of the Russian emigrant architect Ivan Afanasjeviƒç Rik, between 1938 and 1941. It has a basis in the form of a cross of a developed type. The main dome rises at the intersection of the arms of the cross, while four smaller domes rise above the arms. One dome rises above the western facade and it houses the bell tower. Since the plan did not foresee the choir apses, the church has an emphasized longevity of volume. Enough light does not come to the interior of the narthex through two narrow single windows open on the west wall, so that the main source of light comes from the opposite side of the nave, but in spite of that, the narthex is underexposed in certain parts of the day. In contrast, the nave is well lit thanks to a series of cupola windows and window openings in the form of trefoil and two single windows on the side walls. Significance What makes this building special, in addition to its distinctive architectural value, is its unique memorial function. The church's crypt stores about 37 m¬≥ of remains of Serbian and enemy soldiers who died in the Battle of Kolubara in 1914. The crypt was renovated between 1961 and 1964 under the direction of architect D. St. Pavloviƒá. The area of the crypt was then divided into three parts. The first part is located in the west, the second in the central, and the third in the eastern part of the crypt. The main entrance to the crypt was opened on the north wall of the west continent. Their surfaces are filled by special panels on which basic information about the Battle of Kolubara and significant details are carved and effective visual representations of battlefields on which the Battle of Kolubara took place, arrangement of Serbian and enemy forces at certain stages of the battle, display of breakthroughs and directions of enemy prosecution. Relief plates are also built into particular frames. They illustrate the details of the Battle of Kolubara and the work of the sculptor –úihailo Tomiƒá in a creative way. Text is engraved in the eastern side of the wall mass. The silhouette figures of Serbian soldiers, peasant men and peasant women in folk costumes were derived in shallow relief. With regard to the grave function of this space, the wall compartments of the charnel-house above the sarcophagus are refined with a decorative cladding of red marble, and 21 gray marble plate inscribed with the army's regiments is inserted on each side; on the north wall, of the Army of the commander General ≈Ωivojin Mi≈°iƒá, on the eastern wall, of the II Army of the commander Duke Stepan Stepanoviƒá, and on the south wall, of the III Army of the commander General Pavle Juri≈°iƒá-≈†turm and of the U≈æice military commander General Vukoman Araƒçiƒá. The niche of the east continent hosts a sculpture of a soldier. This building was included into the list of cultural monuments of \\"exceptional importance\\" in 1966. The church iconostasis was painted in 1940 by a prominent Russian emigrant painter Pimen Sofronov. It had been planned that he should paint the church with icons, but this could not be achieved due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The church was painted with icons only in the last decade of the 20th and first half of the 21st century. Built at the very end of the interwar period, the memorial church with the charnel-house in Lazarevac is stylistically unique and recognizable work. It is, next to Church of Saint ƒêorƒëe in Oplenac, the most monumental memorial that was erected in the former –öingdom of Yugoslavia, which gives it a special character.

It aired as part of Shell Presents, a monthly presentation of standalone productions which aired from 1959 to 1960 on ATN-7 in Sydney and GTV-9 in Melbourne. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. In contrast with the first three episodes of Shell Presents, which were tragedies, this was a comedy. It was also the first based on an original Australian script. The production was broadcast live in Sydney and later shown in Melbourne via a video-tape recording. Then Governor General William Slim was present at the live broadcast. Plot Set in Sydney. Two men (Stewart Ginn and Kevin Brennan), after being released from prison, unintentionally become involved in a baby kidnapping plot. Cast *Stewart Ginn *Kevin Brennan *June Salter as Ginn's girlfriend *Fifi Banvard as the landlady of the house *Diana Davidson *Gordon Glenwright Production June Salter, Kevin Brennan, Stewart Ginn SMH 22 Jun 1959 The original script, by Ross Napier, won third prize of ¬£400 in the ¬£3,000 Shell Australian TV drama competition. First prize when to a play about Victoria's \\"Black Friday\\" on 13 January 1939, \\"The Day Called Black,\\" by Robin Cornfield. Second prize went to \\"The Bed by the Window\\" about a hospital murder by Paul Chidlow. The first prize for adaptations went to Charles Phillips for an adaptation of the Henry Lawson story \\"Send Around the Hat.\\" Second prize went to Catherine Hamilton for an adaptation of the Emlyn Williams play, \\"The Druid's Rest\\". James Downing won third prize for adapting the Victorian Sardou story, \\"The Black Pearl.\\" The judges, Harry Dearth, Royston Morley, and John McCallum, said the standard of entries was disappointingly low. Napier rewrote the play after submitting it for the prize. He called it \\"a light drama with a humorous element.\\" Brett Porter producer of Shell Presents said \\"So far we have concentrated on topline American plays. These have proved very successful... But we need a proportion of good Australian plays if we are really going to produce first-rate TV drama for Australian audiences. We are making every effort to assist local writers and to introduce them to the particular problem of writing plays for TV.\\" It was the first TV appearance for Stewart Ginn and Fifi Banvard. Kevin Brennan had impressed in Johnny Belinda. Australian's Governor General, Sir William Slim visited the set and watched dress rehearsals. The budget of the show was ¬£3,070. Reception The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the \\"chief fault\\" of the play was it \\"stretched half an hour's worth of material over an hour-long format\\" and \\"the direct, waist-high frontal attack of director David Cahill's cameras. A little more imagination in the choice of angles and distance would have considerably reduced this monotony of observation\\" however it praised the touches and thought \\"the actors served... [the writer] well. The Sunday Sydney Morning Herald said the production \\"left me a shade disappointed. Author Ross Napier proved to be a skilled and professional manipulator of words and dialogue but he developed one joke... far too long.\\" The Woman's Weekly critic called it \\"embarrassingly bad to watch\\". The Age said \\"there was not much to enthuse about\\" calling the play \\"feeble, thin and unfunny.\\" In 1992 June Salter said it was the worst play or show she had ever been in.

It is about west of St Davids, and about east of the Pembrokeshire coast. The hilltop's rocky outcrop contains evidence of Neolithic and Iron Age settlements. The site's nearest water source was Ffynnon Lygaid, a deep pool, fed by a spring. Near the base of the outcrop's southern side, the pool is in a small hollow, measuring about by . The site was excavated in 1902 by Sabine Baring-Gould, and by Audrey Williams, for the Ancient Monuments Inspectorate, in 1943. The outcrop became the stronghold of a 6th-century CE Irish pirate named Boia, after whom (with clegyr ()) it is now called. Neolithic Evidence of Neolithic settlement in Wales is extremely uncommon. Megalithic burial chambers are normally the only Neolithic structures to survive. However, an excavation of the site by Sabine Baring-Gould, in 1903, showed the remains of rectangular and circular Neolithic dwellings. An associated midden has been dated to around 5500 years before present (BP), during the early to middle Neolithic. Sherds of Neolithic round-bottomed pottery, polished stone axes and animal bones were also discovered. Baring-Gould thought the pottery may have been wheel-turned. No hearths were found within the dwellings. However, \\"substantial\\" charcoal deposits were found on the site, indicating fire was used, and carefully managed. Samples from the area of Neolithic occupation (hut and midden), radiocarbon dated in 1973, indicated a date of around 2370 BP, the beginning of La T√®ne culture, at the early British Iron Age, but were considered unacceptable by the National Museum Wales. Iron Age The hill's steep sides were augmented by a single earthen rampart, to form a defensive structure known as a hillfort. The outcrop's southern part was further enclosed by stone walls, roughly rectangular, and measuring about by . Built as a dry-stone wall, from stone rubble and earth, the ramparts stand about above the enclosure floor. Revetted with stone blocks, the walls varied between and wide and were \\"faced externally with large slabs set on end\\". According to Baring-Gould, the enclosure's original surface was below its 1903 level. The enclosure's entrance may have been through a tunnel. Radiocarbon dated samples from near the hillfort entrance indicate a date of around 1950 BP (1 BCE), the late Iron Age.

He was the best European in the pole vault, clearing 3.90 m and placing seventh. In the decathlon he was ninth, scoring 7071.425 points (5906 with modern scoring tables). Although he was a specialist, he did not win the decathlon pole vault as he only managed 3.60 m; he did, however, win the decathlon long jump with a leap of 6.97 m. After returning home he improved his Swedish pole vault record to 4.00 m, the first Swede and only the third European (after Charles Hoff and Henry Petersen) to vault four metres or more.

The film premiered in British Hong Kong on 19 November 1992. Plot summary cantonese businessman Kiu doesn't have time to woo a girl. On a trip to Saigon, he offers financial help to poor girl Shun's (very troubled) family if she'll come and live with him. With a sense of duty but no love, she agrees, too timid to even tell boyfriend Lik just after losing her virginity to him. Love fails to blossom between Shun and Kiu in hong kong, and Kiu starts to drink heavily. Sandy, Kiu's luscious secretary takes advantage and gets it off with him in the gym and disgusts Shun in the process. Shun gets drunk and is picked up in a bar, nearly raped, and rescued then friended by a fellow Vietnamese girl, and a photographer, in what is clearly a set up. Sandy Turns out is behind this refuse as well, to get Shun out of the way and have Kiu all to herself. But things don't go according to anyone's plan. Will Shun give up Kiu and his money to go back to Lik? Will Sandy hold her nerve and push ahead? and Will the guys Sandy paid to set up Shun have their way with Sandy instead?
